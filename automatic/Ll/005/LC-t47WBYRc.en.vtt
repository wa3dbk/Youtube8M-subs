here's<00:00:01.110> my<00:00:01.170> little<00:00:01.380> generator<00:00:01.829> project<00:00:02.159> i

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
here's my little generator project i

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.470 
here's my little generator project i
started<00:00:02.909> out<00:00:03.449> with<00:00:03.920> a<00:00:05.180> generator<00:00:06.180> that<00:00:06.420> i

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
started out with a generator that i

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.070 
started out with a generator that i

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
direction in a different trench is this

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.470 
direction in a different trench is this
line<00:00:46.140> here<00:00:46.530> which<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.190> fuel<00:00:47.460> line<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:48.329> this

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
line here which is the fuel line in this

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.580 
line here which is the fuel line in this
case<00:00:48.690> this<00:00:48.899> generator<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.770> using<00:00:50.460> propane<00:00:50.850> and

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
case this generator is using propane and

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.430 
case this generator is using propane and
so<00:00:52.590> here<00:00:52.890> we<00:00:53.010> have<00:00:53.039> our<00:00:53.219> our<00:00:53.660> fuel<00:00:54.660> line<00:00:54.930> trench

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
so here we have our our fuel line trench

okay seriously here's the electrical

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.610 
okay seriously here's the electrical
going<00:02:17.130> into<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.430> house<00:02:17.580> this<00:02:18.390> this<00:02:19.080> is<00:02:19.410> the

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
going into the house this this is the

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.170 
going into the house this this is the
old<00:02:19.740> transfer<00:02:20.310> switch<00:02:20.580> it's<00:02:20.820> just<00:02:21.000> kind<00:02:21.150> of

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
old transfer switch it's just kind of

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.850 
old transfer switch it's just kind of
hanging<00:02:21.390> there<00:02:21.630> right<00:02:21.810> now<00:02:21.990> it's<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.560> manual

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
hanging there right now it's a manual

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.680 
hanging there right now it's a manual
transfer<00:02:23.220> switch<00:02:23.670> where<00:02:23.910> you've<00:02:24.000> got<00:02:24.210> to<00:02:24.390> hook

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
transfer switch where you've got to hook

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.510 
transfer switch where you've got to hook
a<00:02:24.810> generator<00:02:25.230> into<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.680> plug<00:02:25.890> it<00:02:25.920> into<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:26.370> and

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
a generator into it plug it into it and

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.090 
a generator into it plug it into it and
flip<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.150> individual<00:02:27.630> circuits<00:02:27.990> this<00:02:28.590> this

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
flip the individual circuits this this

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.650 
flip the individual circuits this this
generator<00:02:29.550> because<00:02:29.670> of<00:02:29.910> its<00:02:30.060> size<00:02:30.210> and<00:02:30.270> etc

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
generator because of its size and etc

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.530 
generator because of its size and etc
will<00:02:31.020> be<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.170> whole<00:02:31.470> house<00:02:31.650> generator<00:02:32.210> so<00:02:33.210> we've

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
will be a whole house generator so we've

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.540 
will be a whole house generator so we've
got<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.960> the<00:02:34.260> 2-inch<00:02:34.620> sorry<00:02:35.160> for<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.430> blurry

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
got the the 2-inch sorry for the blurry

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.210 
got the the 2-inch sorry for the blurry
picture<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.300> two-inch<00:02:36.600> conduit<00:02:36.960> here<00:02:37.350> and<00:02:37.530> a

one and a half inch conduit here so the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.550 
one and a half inch conduit here so the
way<00:02:40.440> this<00:02:41.100> is<00:02:41.250> going<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.550> work<00:02:41.670> is<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.780> the

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
way this is going to work is the the

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.320 
way this is going to work is the the
main<00:02:43.740> line<00:02:43.980> that's<00:02:44.580> right<00:02:44.820> now<00:02:45.000> over<00:02:45.210> the

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
main line that's right now over the

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.380 
main line that's right now over the
panel<00:02:45.690> this<00:02:45.810> gray<00:02:46.110> gray<00:02:47.010> line<00:02:47.280> here<00:02:47.760> will<00:02:48.240> be

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
panel this gray gray line here will be

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.150 
panel this gray gray line here will be
cut<00:02:48.690> over<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:48.960> the<00:02:49.320> whole<00:02:49.560> house<00:02:49.740> transfer

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
cut over to the whole house transfer

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.700 
cut over to the whole house transfer
switch<00:02:50.520> here<00:02:51.210> and<00:02:51.420> then<00:02:52.320> it<00:02:52.410> will<00:02:52.500> come<00:02:52.680> down

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
switch here and then it will come down

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.270 
switch here and then it will come down
to<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.370> preferred<00:02:53.820> power<00:02:54.090> input<00:02:54.600> here<00:02:55.280> and

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
to the preferred power input here and

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.100 
to the preferred power input here and
then<00:02:56.490> as<00:02:56.730> you<00:02:56.790> can<00:02:56.880> see<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.270> alternate<00:02:57.750> over

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
then as you can see the alternate over

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.690 
then as you can see the alternate over
to<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.290> generator<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:58.830> already<00:02:59.460> connected

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
to the generator is already connected

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.290 
to the generator is already connected
and<00:03:00.090> right<00:03:00.840> behind<00:03:01.170> it<00:03:01.410> is<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.830> load<00:03:02.180> so<00:03:03.180> the

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
and right behind it is the load so the

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.600 
and right behind it is the load so the
load<00:03:03.450> is<00:03:03.600> going<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:03.840> come<00:03:03.990> out<00:03:04.140> come<00:03:04.410> down<00:03:05.250> to

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
load is going to come out come down to

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.650 
load is going to come out come down to
this<00:03:05.940> conduit<00:03:06.390> here<00:03:06.840> go<00:03:07.530> over<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.180> into<00:03:09.180> my

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
this conduit here go over and into my

this conduit here go over and into my
main<00:03:09.990> circuit<00:03:10.440> breaker<00:03:10.590> panel<00:03:11.660> so<00:03:12.660> that's<00:03:13.230> how

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
main circuit breaker panel so that's how

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.200 
main circuit breaker panel so that's how
that<00:03:13.470> works<00:03:13.650> this<00:03:13.980> is<00:03:14.160> up<00:03:14.310> this<00:03:14.520> is<00:03:14.700> an<00:03:14.820> as<00:03:14.940> Co

185<00:03:16.340> transfer<00:03:17.340> switch<00:03:17.580> a<00:03:17.820> little<00:03:18.120> bit<00:03:18.240> more

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
185 transfer switch a little bit more

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.020 
185 transfer switch a little bit more
industrial<00:03:19.050> than<00:03:19.290> then<00:03:20.280> say<00:03:20.640> some<00:03:20.880> of<00:03:20.910> the

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
industrial than then say some of the

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.460 
industrial than then say some of the
other<00:03:21.180> transfer<00:03:21.660> switches<00:03:21.900> out<00:03:22.170> there<00:03:22.380> it

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
other transfer switches out there it

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.580 
other transfer switches out there it
will<00:03:22.590> it's<00:03:23.370> a<00:03:23.460> 200<00:03:23.880> amp<00:03:24.000> transfer<00:03:24.420> switch<00:03:24.660> so

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
will it's a 200 amp transfer switch so

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.610 
will it's a 200 amp transfer switch so
it<00:03:25.740> will<00:03:25.860> easily<00:03:26.040> handle<00:03:26.820> the<00:03:26.940> entire<00:03:27.240> home

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
it will easily handle the entire home

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.440 
it will easily handle the entire home
the<00:03:28.620> generator<00:03:29.040> will<00:03:29.220> start<00:03:29.550> and<00:03:29.730> take<00:03:30.240> the

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
the generator will start and take the

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.280 
the generator will start and take the
entire<00:03:30.960> house<00:03:31.230> on<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.830> load<00:03:31.980> and<00:03:33.050> so<00:03:34.050> there

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
entire house on the load and so there

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.520 
entire house on the load and so there
will<00:03:34.440> be<00:03:35.030> three<00:03:36.030> op<00:03:36.180> topper<00:03:36.600> going<00:03:37.350> between

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
will be three op topper going between

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.700 
will be three op topper going between
that<00:03:38.010> panel<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:38.580> the<00:03:39.510> current<00:03:40.290> electrical

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:40.710 
that panel and the current electrical

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.710 
that panel and the current electrical
panel<00:03:41.070> which<00:03:41.220> will<00:03:41.430> carry<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:41.910> entire<00:03:42.000> 200

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
panel which will carry the entire 200

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.330 
panel which will carry the entire 200
amps<00:03:42.960> in<00:03:43.080> fact<00:03:43.380> I<00:03:43.500> think<00:03:43.590> it's<00:03:43.770> rated<00:03:44.040> to<00:03:44.160> like

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
amps in fact I think it's rated to like

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.880 
amps in fact I think it's rated to like
225<00:03:45.090> amps<00:03:45.510> so<00:03:46.260> should<00:03:46.590> be<00:03:46.710> no<00:03:46.890> problem<00:03:47.340> there

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
225 amps so should be no problem there

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.070 
225 amps so should be no problem there
this<00:03:49.890> is<00:03:50.040> a<00:03:50.070> generator<00:03:50.580> itself<00:03:50.970> as<00:03:51.750> you<00:03:51.930> can

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
this is a generator itself as you can

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.320 
this is a generator itself as you can
see<00:03:52.230> it<00:03:52.350> sits<00:03:52.650> out<00:03:52.800> of<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:52.980> housing<00:03:53.210> the<00:03:54.210> way

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
see it sits out of the housing the way

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.450 
see it sits out of the housing the way
it's<00:03:54.480> going<00:03:54.660> to<00:03:54.750> work<00:03:54.810> is<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.770> generator<00:03:56.190> will

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:56.460 
it's going to work is the generator will

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.160 
it's going to work is the generator will
be<00:03:56.670> once<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.150> concrete<00:03:57.330> pad<00:03:57.720> is<00:03:57.870> poured

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
be once the concrete pad is poured

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.730 
be once the concrete pad is poured

certainly as good as if not better than

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.250 
certainly as good as if not better than
