00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
once she stays in the tank the current

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.389 
once she stays in the tank the current
of<00:02:04.929> the<00:02:04.990> water<00:02:05.170> moving<00:02:05.799> with<00:02:06.100> all<00:02:06.250> the

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.210 
what's still right now this is one of
the<00:02:10.060> pumps<00:02:10.360> is<00:02:10.479> off<00:02:11.580> but<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:14.650> moves<00:02:14.860> up<00:02:15.069> and

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
the pumps is off but it moves up and

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.820 
the pumps is off but it moves up and
down<00:02:15.310> it's<00:02:16.300> really<00:02:16.480> hard<00:02:16.660> to<00:02:16.780> read<00:02:16.989> it<00:02:17.110> so<00:02:17.800> I

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
down it's really hard to read it so I

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.320 
down it's really hard to read it so I
was<00:02:18.160> singing<00:02:18.340> I'm<00:02:18.489> just<00:02:18.640> getting<00:02:18.910> out<00:02:19.030> another

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
was singing I'm just getting out another

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.420 
was singing I'm just getting out another
hydrometer<00:02:20.140> i<00:02:20.200> paid<00:02:20.410> ten<00:02:20.650> bucks<00:02:20.860> for<00:02:21.130> this<00:02:21.190> one

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
hydrometer i paid ten bucks for this one

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.600 
hydrometer i paid ten bucks for this one
so<00:02:22.680> it<00:02:23.680> works<00:02:24.220> though

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
so it works though

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.170 
so it works though
you<00:02:25.880> can<00:02:26.060> see<00:02:26.240> it

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
you can see it

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.199 
you can see it
while<00:02:27.569> it<00:02:27.659> was<00:02:27.810> moved<00:02:28.200> second<00:02:28.680> dollar<00:02:29.209> um

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
while it was moved second dollar um

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.059 
while it was moved second dollar um

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
up the sand bed I'll probably do it

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.420 
up the sand bed I'll probably do it
after<00:02:41.489> this<00:02:41.579> video<00:02:42.829> but<00:02:43.829> everything's<00:02:44.129> coming

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
after this video but everything's coming

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.429 
after this video but everything's coming
along<00:02:44.519> well<00:02:44.939> I<00:02:45.209> was<00:02:45.810> thinking<00:02:46.019> to<00:02:46.079> get<00:02:46.170> more

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:46.439 
along well I was thinking to get more

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:49.699 
along well I was thinking to get more
live<00:02:46.680> rock<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.519> tank<00:02:48.200> to<00:02:49.200> replace<00:02:49.530> these

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
live rock to the tank to replace these

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.470 
live rock to the tank to replace these
fake<00:02:50.010> rocks<00:02:50.340> i'm<00:02:50.549> hoping<00:02:50.879> that<00:02:50.909> coralline

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
fake rocks i'm hoping that coralline

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.440 
fake rocks i'm hoping that coralline
algae<00:02:51.510> will<00:02:52.019> cover<00:02:52.230> these<00:02:52.439> fake<00:02:52.680> rocks<00:02:53.450> then

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
algae will cover these fake rocks then

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.789 
algae will cover these fake rocks then
they'll<00:02:54.629> make<00:02:54.870> them<00:02:54.989> look<00:02:55.139> just<00:02:55.439> like<00:02:55.560> these

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
they'll make them look just like these

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.740 
they'll make them look just like these
rocks<00:02:56.099> that's<00:02:56.340> what<00:02:56.519> I'm<00:02:56.609> hoping<00:02:56.760> for

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
rocks that's what I'm hoping for

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.330 
rocks that's what I'm hoping for
because<00:02:59.260> I<00:02:59.350> originally<00:02:59.500> bought<00:02:59.770> these<00:03:00.100> fake

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
because I originally bought these fake

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.680 
because I originally bought these fake
rocks<00:03:00.610> and<00:03:01.000> I<00:03:01.090> was<00:03:01.210> just<00:03:01.360> gonna<00:03:01.510> use<00:03:01.660> that

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
rocks and I was just gonna use that

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.940 
rocks and I was just gonna use that
because<00:03:01.990> the<00:03:02.080> pet<00:03:02.260> store<00:03:02.500> was<00:03:02.620> out<00:03:02.740> which

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
because the pet store was out which

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.460 
because the pet store was out which
petco<00:03:03.310> didn't<00:03:03.700> sell<00:03:03.910> live<00:03:04.180> rock<00:03:04.450> so<00:03:05.230> i<00:03:05.290> bought

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
petco didn't sell live rock so i bought

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.530 
petco didn't sell live rock so i bought
these<00:03:05.620> fake<00:03:05.860> Bronx<00:03:06.280> you<00:03:06.970> look<00:03:07.150> at<00:03:07.240> the<00:03:07.300> first

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
these fake Bronx you look at the first

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.480 
these fake Bronx you look at the first
video<00:03:07.870> I<00:03:08.170> was<00:03:08.470> gonna<00:03:08.620> just<00:03:08.860> have<00:03:09.010> fake<00:03:09.250> rocks

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
video I was gonna just have fake rocks

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.890 
video I was gonna just have fake rocks
from<00:03:09.610> there<00:03:09.760> but<00:03:09.880> I<00:03:10.210> didn't<00:03:10.510> think<00:03:10.540> it<00:03:10.750> looks

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
from there but I didn't think it looks

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.380 
from there but I didn't think it looks
right<00:03:11.020> so<00:03:11.200> I<00:03:11.260> got<00:03:11.440> some<00:03:11.650> live<00:03:11.860> rock<00:03:12.180> I'm<00:03:13.180> think

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
right so I got some live rock I'm think

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.060 
right so I got some live rock I'm think
I'm<00:03:13.450> going<00:03:13.600> to<00:03:13.660> I<00:03:13.930> got<00:03:14.320> about<00:03:14.440> 10<00:03:14.680> pounds<00:03:14.830> of

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
I'm going to I got about 10 pounds of

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.660 
I'm going to I got about 10 pounds of
live<00:03:15.190> rock<00:03:15.400> and<00:03:15.640> five<00:03:15.850> pounds<00:03:16.150> of<00:03:16.240> fake<00:03:16.420> dog

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
live rock and five pounds of fake dog

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.820 
live rock and five pounds of fake dog
so<00:03:18.300> I'm<00:03:18.569> thinking<00:03:18.630> of<00:03:18.990> switching<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.500> pay<00:03:19.650> back

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
so I'm thinking of switching to pay back

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.860 
so I'm thinking of switching to pay back
with<00:03:20.040> my<00:03:20.190> life<00:03:20.400> back<00:03:20.670> that's<00:03:21.390> pretty<00:03:21.660> much<00:03:21.810> the

let's<00:03:30.050> see<00:03:30.290> that's<00:03:30.590> pretty<00:03:31.220> much<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.550> update

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
let's see that's pretty much the update

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.760 
let's see that's pretty much the update
on<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:32.540> tank

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
on the tank

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.580 
on the tank
let's<00:03:35.370> see<00:03:35.520> what<00:03:35.700> else<00:03:35.790> I<00:03:36.060> think<00:03:36.150> I<00:03:36.590> the

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
let's see what else I think I the

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.740 
let's see what else I think I the
background<00:03:38.160> on<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.000> tank<00:03:39.240> is<00:03:39.360> different<00:03:39.690> i

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750

background on the tank is different i
had<00:03:39.900> blue<00:03:40.110> construction<00:03:40.650> paper<00:03:40.800> on<00:03:41.010> there

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
had blue construction paper on there

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.940 
had blue construction paper on there
and<00:03:43.120> I<00:03:43.240> switched<00:03:43.750> to<00:03:43.959> this<00:03:44.200> blue<00:03:44.500> background

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
and I switched to this blue background

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.949 
and I switched to this blue background
that<00:03:45.040> about<00:03:45.360> because<00:03:46.360> the<00:03:46.480> construction

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
that about because the construction

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.510 
that about because the construction
paper<00:03:47.110> got<00:03:47.319> wet<00:03:47.350> and<00:03:47.590> he<00:03:47.800> got<00:03:47.920> all<00:03:48.069> messed<00:03:48.310> up

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
paper got wet and he got all messed up

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.780 
paper got wet and he got all messed up
and<00:03:48.760> so

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
can see the strain right there i

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.619 
can see the strain right there i
switched<00:04:06.439> filters<00:04:07.010> i<00:04:07.400> had<00:04:07.730> mouth<00:04:07.939> attacks<00:04:08.450> 10

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:08.629 
switched filters i had mouth attacks 10

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:11.410 
switched filters i had mouth attacks 10
to<00:04:08.750> 20<00:04:08.989> gallon<00:04:09.290> filter<00:04:09.650> on<00:04:09.769> here<00:04:10.269> and<00:04:11.269> I

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
to 20 gallon filter on here and I

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.589 
to 20 gallon filter on here and I
switched<00:04:11.629> with<00:04:11.930> a<00:04:11.959> whisper<00:04:12.790> 30<00:04:13.790> gallon<00:04:14.209> filter

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:14.599 
switched with a whisper 30 gallon filter

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:17.460 
switched with a whisper 30 gallon filter
so<00:04:14.810> it<00:04:14.840> can<00:04:15.019> go<00:04:15.140> a<00:04:15.170> little<00:04:15.650> more<00:04:15.890> filtration

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
so it can go a little more filtration

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.020 
so it can go a little more filtration
put<00:04:18.470> some<00:04:18.590> bio<00:04:18.769> balls<00:04:19.100> in<00:04:19.340> there<00:04:19.519> and<00:04:19.789> the

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:22.699 
cartridge and a bio fiber paddock

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:27.070 
cartridge and a bio fiber paddock
because<00:04:22.970> what<00:04:23.120> you<00:04:23.180> call<00:04:23.389> it<00:04:25.449> so<00:04:26.449> let's<00:04:26.840> see

because what you call it so let's see
that's<00:04:27.320> pretty<00:04:27.710> much<00:04:27.800> it<00:04:27.860> protein<00:04:28.460> skimmers

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
what can get it hasn't actually come it

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.400 
what can get it hasn't actually come it
hasn't<00:04:31.070> bubbled<00:04:31.520> up<00:04:31.580> and<00:04:31.789> gotten<00:04:32.229> like<00:04:33.229> all

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
hasn't bubbled up and gotten like all

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:34.659 
hasn't bubbled up and gotten like all
the<00:04:33.500> crap<00:04:33.710> of<00:04:33.860> the<00:04:33.949> water<00:04:34.100> in<00:04:34.250> a<00:04:34.280> couple<00:04:34.550> days
