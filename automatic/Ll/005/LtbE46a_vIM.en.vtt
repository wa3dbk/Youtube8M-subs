 to talk about grabbing another train that 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:59.739
 follow we will not go out 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.739
 and have to wait 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:09.580
 of chiapas mexicanos how many trains 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.470

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.570
 14 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.340
 this is the new route that migrants 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.620
 they are taking to the violence that there is 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.170
 in the Gulf of Mexico and in states like 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.660
 san luis zacatecas coahuila new lion and 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.360
 Tamaulipas where the criminal groups 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.820
 the massacres kidnap them or the 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.910
 they force to be their slaves but this 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.220
 route has a small inconvenience 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.170
 enter the same hell crosses the 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.290
 desert of sonora temperatures by 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.690
 above 50 degrees that's why 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.460
 they call it the devil train like this 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.730
 that trip with so much heat in the middle of 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.730
 desert 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.010
 34 gallons of fertilizers had a taking 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.010
 and they come wet from the clothes 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:05.540
 wet your clothes because one water to 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:08.320
 take by who did not bring water with water 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:12.510
 have to put up with it or if it helps some 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:14.890
 you get to faint because of so much heat 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.660
 in the sea and hydrates 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.410
 in what is 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.410
 that's why look 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.530
 many people with you digress for 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.640
 by hunger or 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:33.670
 lack of water and that makes us many 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:37.069
 Sometimes committing to crime will wait for us 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.290
 asleep here an ox passed 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.709
 we would come meet you 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.300
 to feed on the drug he thinks and passes 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.640
 a drugged 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.470
 through this route hundreds of 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.120
 migrants arrive in northern Mexico with 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.890
 hope to cross the border with 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.170
 USA 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.420
 a line that is now more armored 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.270
 that can only be penetrated by the 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.170
 most inhospitable places the full desert 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.170
 like the rumorosa 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.300
 you are waiting to see if there is a chance 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:14.840
 to pass but if someone told me to go 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.140
 we go at that moment for the 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.120
 hot 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.950
 the recipe is not much if you feel a 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:26.470
 die there will be no more than 70 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.470
 or return to arrive in November 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.810
 who do not achieve it or are deported or 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:38.659
 they expect better weather conditions 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.480
 to try they are doomed to wander 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:44.959
 through the streets of this city taking care of 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.760
 of the attack of cholos or policemen the 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.099
 migrants who realize they cross 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.239
 the border with such heat is suicide 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:54.980
 and seek to return have another challenge 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.319
 escape from this city as being a 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.700
 big criminal problem and guide him to the 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.280
 Floating population 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.620
 the emigrants do not let us leave 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.620
 here he will block control of the train of 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.620
 contraband and when the Valencians 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.629
 back and forth the federal police 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.730
 hits us a quality of a joke or 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:17.109
 accord of the one that hits us and do not let us 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.109
 the exit and cali 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:27.949
 also because the train that can not 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.129
 grab I do not want to get out of here this 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:32.159
 state 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:35.029
 it warms up heats the big hook that 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:35.029
 they heat calluses 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.680
 that's why every evening dozens of 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.440
 migrants try to take the same train 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.190
 of the devil but now back towards 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.190
 the south of the country 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.830
 down 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.600
 but federal police operatives and 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.260
 of private train guards are the 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:10.180
 they prevent and they unemployed do not have 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.750
 money to pay other transportation for 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.750
 out of here 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.719
 from mexicalli to the universal
