00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.180

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:14.650
 Aguero Maa also has a yearly Kira 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:17.700
 I used this year before this year and I used it here 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.320
 It is quite 2 I dribble 6 is missing 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.659
 After the front 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:27.420
 This is recommended Nde there is reasonable Well also degreasing 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:33.240
 Second top teves on the right 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:36.330
 5 Well, I say a little that want in that trade provides videos Well 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.500
 It's okay to trade , so it's better to trade. 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.730
 I think that it became a race day and Town crack This is enough strong 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.650
 2 is 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:48.830
 Messi down the top 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.830
 Something to really Well breakthrough was this guy do confectionery that you are 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.229
 What 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.840
 The hands of a good time, I will have is immediately taken If you think really when I But I bad good Atco 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.190
 Best messi 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:08.259
 In fact, it was revealed today that cooperation was bad 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:11.060
 Is not it a choice that had bird color or three times successful not when 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.910
 There it is that it does not rise or N Itto Ichida 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:20.000
 Messi and Aguero 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:24.190
 Aguero is good, but if I raise Aguero and Messi, I 'll work together depending on the body but Teves and rice 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.190
 It is bad for consecutive holidays Please be careful a little 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.680
 At last 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.250
 Right 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.600
 Evil Gonzalez in the per Well Well side half 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.930
 Like 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:39.840
 This kind of personal activity has become a kind 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:45.130
 After-dribbling is also quite delicious, and it is a so-called private occasion 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:47.660
 It's a good idea, so it's a good idea, so in the middle of the middle 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.790
 Maldonado 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:56.860
 Maa's 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:03:01.660
 There is nothing that stands out, but there is a sense of security that there is a sense of security. 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:06.640
 There is always this battery squirrel, but there is Maldonado 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:09.630
 Dash power is slightly higher with degreasing power adly, but after taking it 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.270
 This is better for dribbling and passes 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.060
 I recommend this 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:18.800
 Left in 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.250
 Lunch I mean volunteer a little per center bit of about slanting eyes after the form 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:26.490
 To ease 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:28.490
 My key player of the sub support of my team is disgusted and is using this now 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.700
 Another minute 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:34.610
 Maybe during the last two games 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:41.200
 I think I 'm going back to a good star 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:46.470
 In the right side back Risa is this that and lesbian slave degree decline video 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:50.520
 Well I found a person who will go as a tray a little 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.300
 Well I think I will be this year's Kira I used to use, but a little different version a little bit 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.799
 Yes 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.819
 Pat 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:04:02.760
 Gody and this guy is really 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.760
 There are a lot of pearls . 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.840
 It 's so good otherwise 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.269
 A little while ago 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:16.139
 Even if I catch up with you 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:21.959
 It is give me the Well I'm good, but I Moreover, the net is often foul 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:24.310
 Lugano guy I replaced the deck, such as using black to this before, but in other southern all of Kira 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.810
 But it was good 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.810
 This person is also of fal 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:36.490
 We cross the response and is in really excellent good But is regrettable that a little is good foul 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:44.689
 In the left side bag 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:48.349
 For example Well, I'm putting now Caceres but Well Well this painful 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:52.330
 Mochoi I use occasionally sounds Which good 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:57.860
 But this Caceres is the place was also the Goi live stamina 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:05:01.060
 You'll run out of stamina 1414 tl is around 12 too 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:04.180
 It will enter amazing this guy 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:09.880
 It is better to use a light to put in this 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:15.550
 In keeper Callisto Well this guy I went Torode pt is pt influence and today 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:20.510
 Gama indeed mother Well as the ne Well white was in Japan I did not win stop the 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:23.340
 Likely there are a good white of you are using It is Toko everyone I passing mark 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.720
 It is a serve from here 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:30.880
 Serve Diego folder of word 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:34.720
 Although Well Ne This person I was not used until recently 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:38.930
 The deciding power is great after trying it 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:46.990
 I'm a little crazy, but Macross 6 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:49.310
 It is a great Well heading and the volley Toka kind of when raised cross 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.350
 I went It is a little Well recommended 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:56.300
 By Rodeiro 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:06:00.050
 This person has a low number too, but I put it in a strong place 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.950
 I can imagine how dribble breakthrough 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.250
 In Demichelis 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.250
 Oh dear 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:14.290
 5 y Man and Kamanari Mardonado and 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:15.220
 Well if Mr Cho is bad, if it is good I use it with a feeling like that. 

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:19.870
 I will 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:21.139
 Well this is a degreasing ability, but a dribbling pass with a drag batter is a bit strange 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:25.210
 is not it 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:29.320
 I do not recommend using it in town and Gachi anymore 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:35.530
 The Deipuru this this man is also foul often this is 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:41.190
 I really thought that I would use this team, but it is a true farewell everyone 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:47.240
 Still it's red It's true that if you ask me if it's full it's defensive collapse 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:54.020
 I'm Buridosso-san, but I don't have an image of him . 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:58.210
 I hit and bought it at the time of opening and assimilation of this last hot voice 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.210
 Foul is little to Well fine 

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:05.910
 It is recommended to choose also a component 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:10.100
 Oh, let me introduce you this much 

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:10.100
 Well a little 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:18.340
 This dad 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:22.490
 It's a tournament, but what kind of decks do you go with? 

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:26.599
 I like this one 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:30.449
 The template is not in law but it feels like that, but everyone 

00:07:26.599 --> 00:07:34.409
 I wonder if I'm who uses his or Kurirona and Karl terrain and 

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:38.060
 If you hit the word rod in the world or something, you can still catch it Krikaka 

00:07:34.409 --> 00:07:42.340
 Well how do you cope with it 

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:42.340
 Well, I'm a good story, even if little or So Well 

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:50.789
