 loxam introduces the door tiller 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.099
 compact and powerful hardware tools for 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.259
 soil preparation this material 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.490
 versatile is particularly suitable 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.289
 to all landscape trades 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.640
 its small size allows it 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.349
 to be easily transported in a 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.419
 van or on a trailer 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.680
 its small size allows me to 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.200
 work on the most 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.399
 cramped and around particular trees 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.800
 with his 21 horses and his jig 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.750
 compact it combines power and 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.370
 maneuverability on all terrains even 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.030
 slope associated with it to different 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.920
 accessories 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.750
 it can cover a multitude 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.160
 of applications buried stone sister 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.170
 near by your land in one 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.060
 passage in order to make a lawn or 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.640
 to regenerate old turf on a 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.260
 width of 90 cm the soil is decompressed 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.940
 the stones and the big clumps of 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.160
 earth are buried in the ground and the 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.380
 fine earth and equalize in surface ready to 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.229
 receive semen other equipment 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.390
 the rotary harrow levels and equalizes the 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.369
 ground in one pass the fine earth 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.890
 and deposited on the surface ready to receive 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.420
 the seedlings for these two accessories the 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.070
 working depth is adjustable 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.080
 easily thanks to the hydraulic system 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.909
 attached to the handlebar the hydraulic cylinder 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.440
 also helps raise the tool 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.100
 finally rank for productivity 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.320
 increased 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.060
 finally for brushcutting and 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.080
 mowing vegetation 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.360
 brushcutters scourge is 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.369
 particularly suitable on a meter of 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.090
 width he cut chopping finely the 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.070
 tall grass 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.619
 brambles or brush up to 4 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.750
 cm of diameter a single pass is enough 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.490
 retractable flails make it possible to 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.600
 reduce shock-related wear with 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.460
 stones or foreign bodies 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.619
 ergonomics and security are 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.220
 also taken into account the startup 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.930
 electric 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.460
 the hydrostatic drive and the 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.170
 hydraulic steering contribute to 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.360
 facilitate the work of the operator 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.220
 the risks of skating are limited 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.509
 thanks to the two hydraulic motors that 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.380
 each feeds a wheel for a 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.150
 maximum traction 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.159
 all orders are centralized at 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.170
 handlebar the speed regulation itself 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.630
 does without releasing the handlebars without clutching 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.799
 a device to the dead equips the 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.349
 wrists to palliate any failure 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.119
 of the operator finally the change 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.459
 accessories is realized very quickly 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.480
 and without tools thanks to the front sleeves 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.090
 tubular with instant lock 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.799
 effective powerful and manageable the 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.629
 tool tiller and its 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:24.700
 different accessories are now 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.700
 available for rent at loxam
