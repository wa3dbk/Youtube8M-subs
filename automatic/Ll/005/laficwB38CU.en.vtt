00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:05.940
 personal and chinese speaking qin 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.260
 In this video, we'll talk. 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:14.849
 about some tips to get past the 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:18.119
 shadow that is a legal measure in a 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:23.100
 your radio is a gift that was networked 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.880
 not normal or in extension the 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.449
 hero 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.490
 These tips are very basic, are not you? 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.679
 giving rotation tips here voting goes 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.250
 be a video on the later because I go 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.390
 get all the talents to see how much 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.790
 cruelty of the table or doing 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:45.030
 for a while in the same you will see 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.300
 in the later video is the tips that I will 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:52.289
 Here, then, give me the first tip I 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.530
 I'm going to give you the catch that we 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.399
 call the top hit that can come 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.030
 here o 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:03.570
 You have no indigo chance. 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:07.290
 against boss against a case that is 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.670
 important as 93 bar and the seat 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.990
 what is the symbol of boston 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.000
 You can not go wrong no hope my 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:20.340
 against the boss because I got the 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.090
 quepe who is gay and 15% find it against 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.119
 boston 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.150
 When you get sicap you can 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.509
 reinforce all the rest you have 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.590
 in your guide or in the case of a 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:38.579
 spirit shadow priest strengthens 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:42.020
 for critical or master or acceleration was 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:45.540
 applied since any main state 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.939
 then you will formulate reinforcing our guide 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.320
 I got the 15 percent that is the 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.140
 next 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:56.430
 The next you have to get is the 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.770
 celebration here or if you pick up 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.630
 that you have a kit that speeds up your 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.030
 advice ask for a little acceleration and 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.770
 also have a link so that the 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.119
 accelerating the selection will cause the 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.009
 your damage 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.420
 according to the time that we give 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.879
 team with every game 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:22.989
 he gives more times during the same time 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:27.819
 then it is the more the selection 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:30.400
 more true is true of the lie in the 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.650
 same time more times more 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.810
 this is going to generate and generate 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.239
 faster and more damage to one part 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.030
 going to the radio is what the people who 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:43.650
 people want to have two caps that a 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:48.310
 Call people have a soft cap and hard cap 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:51.400
 soft is acceleration 8085 you see that 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.689
 I have 5105 gay friends there. 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.739
 not even a little 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:03:00.159
 I did not do pv is often in this 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:02.519
 expansion also right because I'm in another 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:08.349
 server go back to Brazil is 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:10.540
 probably in the coming months as 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:15.129
 that I come back I look for a manager 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:17.889
 do the duty to get a good line so it's 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:20.769
 Get this cap of 80 and 85 for us 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:26.909
 have a fancy that we call honda 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:32.769
 and it is never in all our eyes 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:37.840
 about the pain in kind of flying and 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:41.939
 8085 software the hard and quepe because you 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:45.669
 win one more day here in all these 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:47.859
 10.024 be perceived to have a cap 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:49.329
 This has to have a very good line. 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.159
 have to have practically twice as much 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.590
 acceleration that I have 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:55.930
 so you have to be very safe in 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.349
 guinean I can pass this is mine 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:03.579
 because my trick of 8800 or 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:08.769
 Either you could take four thousand from here 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:09.579
 almost and still would have the hard kepl case in 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.829
 March 31 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:13.539
 I can not wait for the time to 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.139
 people will get into assets can only 

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:17.409
 second 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:20.209
 so it's good but I will not let it either 

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:23.280
 It's very hot, right? 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.860
 We'll catch you later, because you get the 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.090
 close to being able to even ask for 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.440
 acceleration 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.250
 We're going to do what we're going to do. 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.600
 to go critical to the puma stream 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.660
 is what both the customer and 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.340
 month and still so low, my critic 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.330
 especially is very good think 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:46.740
 it got a little harder to pick up 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:48.870
 then just what I like 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.180
 I advise you to do what you 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.400
 making a radio even if it is done 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.620
 same radio several times in what is 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.110
 radio make radio several times and go 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.820
 sell the dts reform everything to critical 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.160
 all that's left 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.419
 everything that is left is critical when 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.639
 until next week 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:07.500
 in the weekend su sunday or 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:10.500
 Monday even reforms everything else 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.810
 trio spends that week doing one of 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.570
 out of it and will follow all this 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.090
 note on paper in the computer and compare 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.550
 We arrived in the third week to define 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:24.600
 if you continue with mastery if you move 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:26.070
 pro master in or if serving side is a 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.260
 Damn, I'll see what it's like, it 's if I 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.530
 put everything to acceleration puts everything 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.530
 in consideration 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:39.180
 so basically this is right and these are 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.729
 are the basic tips I give for 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:45.840
 who wants to start playing and 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:50.190
 leave the shadow on the tv so now 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:51.389
 I'm here again and I hope you 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.160
 liked the video if you liked 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:55.200
 obviously you do not remember 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.030
 click not like if you want to sign up 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.830
 or make more videos every day 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.930
 they are trying to do all the 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.120
 days but also learning how to move not 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.500
 Only denies it so it's kind of difficult. 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.479
 I'm wondering every day too 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:12.500
 So it takes time, but we'll try. 

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:12.500
 now I'm here
