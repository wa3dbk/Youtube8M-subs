00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:14.740
 it is peremptory of psychology has had as a great beginning development this 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:19.109
 the approval of the parents is how you come and raquel because they have 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.100
 commissioned the concept of general psychology what what you 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:26.749
 spend first years of life as pp ends and you can no longer change 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:30.640
 good end and the other what happens to us if it includes clear that it influences 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.440
 this link as it was with my dad with my mom with my brothers 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.040
 it is clear that in its different areas but it does not end forever chami 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.310
 conditioning without conditioning body of work 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.990
 the family will end at a certain time including parent directors 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.660
 but what I do with what happens to me that even as a parent 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.040
 what we do with what the step to the other son you can also see here 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.350
 does not have as a physical coordinator or prevent an infraction foreseen in 12 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.620
 he went up unhappy 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.620
 what a happy childhood was lived would be enough 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.860
 it's like saying with 15 h the 1 102 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.380
 get home 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.340
 on the walls even 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.140
 but without danger 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.470
 efe of everything can be repaired clear influences 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.300
 but it is not definitive because if we are not to the coco channel now it has 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.780
 stuck as your stage the colic 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.190
 still not decided 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.460
 final I'm not demanding and exaggerating but many people 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.299
 I am a victim of a difficult past and it occurs in all social strata 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.080
 cultural and economic 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.270
 so 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.679
 it's not definitive 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:40.430
 it's extremely important 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.270
 because you learn to walk with a certain style 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.000
 and then exemplary beaterator change your own style back and it will cost you 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.180
 to the filmmakers pedro benzal has walked rather 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.590
 the company I know people who depend on the cinema 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.270
 he graduated in faculty 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.640
 ravasi of resilience raises that the human being 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.220
 is able to transform chile something negative happened transform it into a 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.720
 positive experience 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.190
 and that's what we try to achieve is that their parents 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.179
 and that they are not as paralyzed with this idea decrees of age 

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:19.279
 He was 56 years old, he came 10 years ago and 30 hours, except to do more 

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:20.040
 do not 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.460
 jude can be human from his place of that age even when many times not 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.299
 they have to 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:29.060
 kesha narrated that repair something that happened in early childhood but it is not a 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:30.269
 determinism 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.950
 this creator that why did such a thing happen to him with the team cited that the 

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:37.679
 papacy if the father traveled a lot or if the waves 

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:39.269
 poetry and grandfather died 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.299
 with good young money any situation in quotes traumatic 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.079
 that the child can have 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:49.369
 this does not have to be in itself a determinant that conditions for 

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:52.369
 sabella or that does not suit the year hard if they are better 

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:55.819
 there is tension together of you 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.189
 I am like that polti no 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:02.009
 I need time to sit on the seats and so 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:06.249
 because sometimes when commenting that they stopped right or wrong always tells me to 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:08.579
 all that yes what was fault 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:09.879
 for example 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.819
 jovita head laughs all at fault 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.399
 I do not understand why 

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:17.369
 Solbes announced President Carlos Abdo 

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:20.369
 at the time of repair and healing 

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:25.739
 gin 13 without dislodging select patients to be child at the time 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.739
 He worked with all kinds of work with children with parents with adults 

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:33.629
 to be able to revert the story script 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:37.159
 Obviously, parents have a responsibility 

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:42.109
 because we are if next to an autistic child they talk about their middle class 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:46.299
 in barquisimeto years will always be able to change 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.479
 The other conditions can be removed in operation
