today's<00:00:00.269> number<00:00:00.719> is<00:00:00.900> 80<00:00:01.730> mm<00:00:02.730> which<00:00:03.060> is<00:00:03.270> a<00:00:03.300> weird

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
today's number is 80 mm which is a weird

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.170 
today's number is 80 mm which is a weird
number<00:00:04.200> two<00:00:04.620> kind<00:00:05.220> of<00:00:05.310> arbitrary<00:00:05.819> sounding

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
number two kind of arbitrary sounding

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.870 
number two kind of arbitrary sounding
number<00:00:06.450> to<00:00:06.569> talk<00:00:06.720> about<00:00:07.130> because<00:00:08.130> this<00:00:08.700> is

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
number to talk about because this is

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.700 
number to talk about because this is
what<00:00:09.000> I<00:00:09.059> wanted<00:00:09.240> to<00:00:09.360> imagine<00:00:09.840> this<00:00:10.170> sequence

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
what I wanted to imagine this sequence

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.250 
what I wanted to imagine this sequence
I'm<00:00:11.550> gonna<00:00:11.700> start<00:00:11.880> this<00:00:12.000> sequence<00:00:12.330> with<00:00:12.450> a2<00:00:13.340> a3

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
I'm gonna start this sequence with a2 a3

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:21.320 
I'm gonna start this sequence with a2 a3
or<00:00:16.490> the<00:00:17.490> next<00:00:17.730> number<00:00:17.960> 82<00:00:18.960> thousands<00:00:20.330> what's

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
or the next number 82 thousands what's

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.599 
or the next number 82 thousands what's
the<00:00:21.420> next<00:00:21.539> number<00:00:21.769> I'm<00:00:22.769> not<00:00:22.920> going<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.130> talk<00:00:23.310> to

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
the next number I'm not going to talk to

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:24.830 
the next number I'm not going to talk to
you<00:00:23.789> with<00:00:23.970> this<00:00:24.090> what<00:00:24.300> I'm<00:00:24.390> not<00:00:24.510> going<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.689> make

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
you with this what I'm not going to make

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.380 
you with this what I'm not going to make
you<00:00:25.080> do<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.769> riddle<00:00:26.130> for<00:00:26.580> this<00:00:26.760> one<00:00:27.000> because

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
you do the riddle for this one because

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.509 
you do the riddle for this one because
we<00:00:27.539> don't<00:00:27.570> know<00:00:27.900> what<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.260> next<00:00:28.410> number<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:28.980> so

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
we don't know what the next number is so

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.150 
we don't know what the next number is so
this<00:00:29.760> sequence<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.689> about<00:00:31.140> using<00:00:31.740> different

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
this sequence is about using different

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.690 
this sequence is about using different
bases<00:00:32.989> normally<00:00:33.989> we<00:00:34.200> use<00:00:34.380> base<00:00:34.649> 10<00:00:34.680> base<00:00:35.340> 10

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
bases normally we use base 10 base 10

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.990 
bases normally we use base 10 base 10
means<00:00:36.059> well<00:00:36.570> if<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.750> took<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.989> number<00:00:37.350> like<00:00:39.649> 231

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
means well if I took a number like 231

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.840 
means well if I took a number like 231
then<00:00:42.000> what<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.450> means<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:43.079> we<00:00:43.860> are<00:00:44.010> doing<00:00:44.190> -

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
then what that means is we are doing -

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.619 
then what that means is we are doing -
lots<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.649> 100<00:00:46.649> which<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.399> actually<00:00:47.670> 10<00:00:47.940> squared

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
lots of 100 which is actually 10 squared

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.369 
lots of 100 which is actually 10 squared
we<00:00:49.110> then<00:00:49.320> add<00:00:49.530> on<00:00:49.829> 3<00:00:50.250> lots<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.879> 10<00:00:51.660> itself<00:00:52.110> and

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
we then add on 3 lots of 10 itself and

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.500 
we then add on 3 lots of 10 itself and
then<00:00:52.680> we<00:00:52.800> add<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:53.160> one<00:00:53.550> locked<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.270> case

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
then we add on one locked in that case

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.889 
then we add on one locked in that case
of<00:00:54.809> 10<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.949> 0<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.399> 1<00:00:56.850> lot<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.180> what<00:00:57.539> 10<00:00:57.809> to

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
of 10 to the 0 so 1 lot of what 10 to

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.709 
of 10 to the 0 so 1 lot of what 10 to
the<00:00:57.989> 0<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.260> 1<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:58.649> that's<00:00:59.010> how<00:00:59.300> regular<00:01:00.300> numbers

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
the 0 is 1 so that's how regular numbers

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.840 
the 0 is 1 so that's how regular numbers
work<00:01:00.960> its<00:01:01.680> powers<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.160> 10<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.609> we're<00:01:02.699> adding

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
work its powers of 10 that we're adding

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.189 
work its powers of 10 that we're adding
together<00:01:03.090> but<00:01:03.570> there's<00:01:03.750> nothing<00:01:03.960> special

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
together but there's nothing special

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.230 
together but there's nothing special
about<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:05.010> number<00:01:05.250> 10<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:05.760> we<00:01:05.850> can<00:01:05.970> do<00:01:06.060> this

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
about the number 10 so we can do this

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.910 
about the number 10 so we can do this
with<00:01:06.510> any<00:01:06.720> number<00:01:07.140> we're<00:01:07.500> going<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.680> choose

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
with any number we're going to choose

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.899 
with any number we're going to choose
any<00:01:08.250> base<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.270> general<00:01:09.720> if<00:01:09.930> we<00:01:10.140> had<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.470> base

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
any base and in general if we had a base

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.870 
any base and in general if we had a base
let's<00:01:11.909> call<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.210> base<00:01:13.020> B<00:01:13.710> well<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.400> means<00:01:14.640> is

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
let's call it base B well that means is

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.660 
let's call it base B well that means is
we're<00:01:15.090> using<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.450> digits<00:01:15.869> 0<00:01:16.250> 1<00:01:17.250> 2<00:01:18.000> 3<00:01:18.659> up<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.670> be

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
we're using the digits 0 1 2 3 up to be

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.260 
we're using the digits 0 1 2 3 up to be
minus<00:01:21.000> 1<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.990> then<00:01:22.439> we<00:01:22.610> are<00:01:23.610> looking<00:01:24.119> at

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
minus 1 and then we are looking at

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.179 
minus 1 and then we are looking at
powers<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:25.080> B<00:01:26.390> so<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.780> would<00:01:28.619> start<00:01:28.920> with<00:01:29.009> B

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
powers of B so that would start with B

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.770 
powers of B so that would start with B
to<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.490> 0<00:01:29.759> which<00:01:30.150> is<00:01:30.180> 1

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
to the 0 which is 1

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.020 
to the 0 which is 1
and<00:01:30.960> then<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.350> would<00:01:31.500> be<00:01:31.650> itself<00:01:32.009> then<00:01:32.670> it's<00:01:32.820> B

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
and then it would be itself then it's B

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.740 
and then it would be itself then it's B
squared<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.840> B<00:01:33.869> cubed<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:35.100> B<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.909> 4<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.659> we

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
squared of B cubed and B to the 4 so we

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.850 
squared of B cubed and B to the 4 so we
have<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.900> little<00:01:37.079> bit<00:01:37.200> practice<00:01:37.560> how<00:01:37.650> we<00:01:37.740> do

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
have a little bit practice how we do

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.080 
have a little bit practice how we do
that<00:01:38.009> it's<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.369> different<00:01:38.640> place<00:01:38.759> yeah

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
that it's in a different place yeah

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.440 
that it's in a different place yeah
let's<00:01:39.360> do<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.600> base<00:01:39.810> 5<00:01:40.350> it's<00:01:40.770> 231<00:01:41.610> in<00:01:41.850> base<00:01:42.090> 5

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
let's do it in base 5 it's 231 in base 5

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.609 
let's do it in base 5 it's 231 in base 5
it's<00:01:43.259> written<00:01:43.530> as<00:01:43.950> 1<00:01:44.610> 4<00:01:45.119> 1<00:01:45.630> 1<00:01:45.930> it's<00:01:46.350> still<00:01:46.530> the

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
it's written as 1 4 1 1 it's still the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.039 
it's written as 1 4 1 1 it's still the
same<00:01:46.799> number<00:01:46.829> it's<00:01:47.399> still<00:01:47.659> 231<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.810> still<00:01:48.960> has

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
same number it's still 231 it still has

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.350 
same number it's still 231 it still has
the<00:01:49.140> same<00:01:49.200> size<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.340> do<00:01:50.490> base<00:01:50.670> 6<00:01:51.000> system

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
the same size so I do base 6 system

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.030 
the same size so I do base 6 system
really<00:01:51.659> make<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:51.899> point<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.409> block<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:52.950> in

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
really make that point a block so in

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.499 
really make that point a block so in
base<00:01:53.250> 6<00:01:53.720> it's<00:01:54.720> written<00:01:54.960> as<00:01:55.110> 1<00:01:55.320> over<00:01:55.619> 2<00:01:56.310> 3<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:57.060> we

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
base 6 it's written as 1 over 2 3 so we

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.840 
base 6 it's written as 1 over 2 3 so we
can<00:01:57.659> write<00:01:57.840> numbers<00:01:58.170> in<00:01:58.290> different<00:01:58.649> bases<00:01:58.850> all

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
can write numbers in different bases all

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.899 
can write numbers in different bases all
right<00:02:00.030> let's<00:02:00.360> do<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:00.600> for<00:02:01.399> 82,000<00:02:02.399> let's<00:02:02.640> see

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
right let's do this for 82,000 let's see

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.539 
right let's do this for 82,000 let's see
what<00:02:03.090> we<00:02:03.240> get<00:02:03.509> in<00:02:03.990> different<00:02:04.439> bases<00:02:04.619> let's

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
what we get in different bases let's

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.059 
what we get in different bases let's
start<00:02:05.969> by<00:02:06.240> doing<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.719> in<00:02:07.020> Bay

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
start by doing it in Bay

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.979 
start by doing it in Bay
-<00:02:08.280> right<00:02:09.060> that's<00:02:09.179> my<00:02:09.360> simple<00:02:09.569> one<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:09.869> can

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
- right that's my simple one you can

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.289 
- right that's my simple one you can
doing<00:02:10.170> alright<00:02:10.319> in<00:02:10.560> base<00:02:10.890> -<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.549> is<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.180> have

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:12.299 
doing alright in base - it is and I have

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:20.030 
doing alright in base - it is and I have
to<00:02:12.450> look<00:02:12.599> this<00:02:12.750> up<00:02:13.280> 101<00:02:14.659> 0<00:02:15.659> 0<00:02:16.200> 0<00:02:16.609> the<00:02:17.609> 0<00:02:17.939> 0<00:02:18.480> 0<00:02:18.840> 0<00:02:19.409> 1

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
0 1 0 0 and a couple of zeros on the end

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.720 
0 1 0 0 and a couple of zeros on the end
of<00:02:24.599> that<00:02:24.659> what<00:02:25.590> does<00:02:25.650> this<00:02:25.769> mean<00:02:25.980> this<00:02:26.670> means

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
of that what does this mean this means

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:35.330 
of that what does this mean this means
it's<00:02:27.420> 2<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.439> the<00:02:28.530> 16<00:02:29.810> +<00:02:30.810> 2<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.799> 14<00:02:33.139> +<00:02:34.189> 2<00:02:35.189> to

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
it's 2 to the 16 + 2 to the 14 + 2 to

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.170 
it's 2 to the 16 + 2 to the 14 + 2 to
the<00:02:35.599> 6<00:02:36.599> plus<00:02:37.469> 2<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.069> the<00:02:38.159> 4<00:02:38.340> that's<00:02:38.939> what<00:02:39.090> it

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
the 6 plus 2 to the 4 that's what it

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.479 
the 6 plus 2 to the 4 that's what it
looks<00:02:39.329> like<00:02:39.450> in<00:02:39.599> base<00:02:39.780> 2<00:02:39.959> in<00:02:40.200> base<00:02:40.590> 3<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.340> looks

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
looks like in base 2 in base 3 it looks

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.390 
looks like in base 2 in base 3 it looks
like<00:02:41.639> this<00:02:41.790> 1<00:02:42.269> 1<00:02:42.540> 0<00:02:42.989> 1<00:02:43.260> 1<00:02:43.829> 1<00:02:43.889> 1<00:02:44.609> 1<00:02:44.849> 0<00:02:44.909> 1<00:02:45.569> right

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
let's try it in baseball it looks like

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:55.819 
let's try it in baseball it looks like

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:44.699 
base 3 base 4 and base 5 as well let's

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:46.339 
base 3 base 4 and base 5 as well let's
take<00:03:44.849> a<00:03:44.940> look<00:03:45.090> at<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.239> sequence<00:03:45.629> why<00:03:46.019> is<00:03:46.079> this

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
take a look at the sequence why is this

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:48.559 
take a look at the sequence why is this
a<00:03:46.409> sequence<00:03:46.919> then<00:03:47.159> because<00:03:48.120> if<00:03:48.239> we<00:03:48.329> were<00:03:48.419> only

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
a sequence then because if we were only

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.020 
a sequence then because if we were only
talking<00:03:48.930> about<00:03:49.109> base<00:03:49.530> 2<00:03:49.919> then<00:03:50.489> the<00:03:50.669> smallest

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
talking about base 2 then the smallest

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.050 
talking about base 2 then the smallest
number<00:03:51.629> you<00:03:52.139> could<00:03:52.349> write<00:03:52.650> using<00:03:53.459> ones<00:03:53.819> and

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
number you could write using ones and

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.479 
number you could write using ones and
zeros<00:03:54.449> without<00:03:54.900> being<00:03:55.379> one<00:03:55.650> itself<00:03:56.129> which<00:03:56.370> is

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
zeros without being one itself which is

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.390 
zeros without being one itself which is
too<00:03:56.609> easy<00:03:56.790> it's<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.629> number<00:03:57.900> 2<00:03:58.079> in<00:03:58.650> base<00:03:58.949> 2

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
too easy it's the number 2 in base 2

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.539 
too easy it's the number 2 in base 2
it's<00:03:59.790> 1<00:04:00.329> 0<00:04:00.500> and<00:04:01.500> that's<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.769> number<00:04:02.010> 2<00:04:02.129> the

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
it's 1 0 and that's the number 2 the

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.210 
it's 1 0 and that's the number 2 the
smallest<00:04:02.939> number<00:04:03.540> you<00:04:04.019> can<00:04:04.259> write<00:04:04.500> using<00:04:04.859> base

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
smallest number you can write using base

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
fails to do that on base six let's look

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.140 
fails to do that on base six let's look
at<00:05:00.699> that<00:05:00.789> in<00:05:01.210> base<00:05:01.630> six<00:05:02.199> eighty<00:05:03.160> two<00:05:03.490> thousand

at that in base six eighty two thousand
is<00:05:04.710> written<00:05:05.710> as<00:05:06.009> this<00:05:06.840> one<00:05:07.870> four<00:05:08.530> three<00:05:09.310> are

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.790 
is written as this one four three are
already<00:05:10.389> am<00:05:10.539> disappointed<00:05:11.370> one<00:05:12.370> three<00:05:13.060> four

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
already am disappointed one three four

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.089 
already am disappointed one three four
four<00:05:14.880> so<00:05:15.880> uh<00:05:15.960> it's<00:05:16.960> already<00:05:17.259> failing<00:05:17.830> there

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
four so uh it's already failing there

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:21.240 
four so uh it's already failing there
now<00:05:18.819> if<00:05:19.150> there<00:05:19.330> is<00:05:19.419> a<00:05:19.449> next<00:05:19.870> number<00:05:20.199> there<00:05:20.440> it

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
now if there is a next number there it

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.890 
now if there is a next number there it
would<00:05:21.490> have<00:05:21.520> to<00:05:22.030> be<00:05:22.210> written<00:05:22.389> in<00:05:22.630> ones<00:05:22.780> and

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
would have to be written in ones and

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.129 
would have to be written in ones and
zeros<00:05:22.990> in<00:05:23.680> base<00:05:24.490> six<00:05:24.840> but<00:05:25.840> it<00:05:25.900> has<00:05:26.020> to<00:05:26.080> be

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 
zeros in base six but it has to be

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:28.140 
zeros in base six but it has to be
written<00:05:26.259> ones<00:05:26.620> and<00:05:26.770> zeros<00:05:27.099> in<00:05:27.250> base<00:05:27.430> five<00:05:27.460> and

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
written ones and zeros in base five and

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.890 
written ones and zeros in base five and
four<00:05:28.360> and<00:05:28.570> three<00:05:28.659> and<00:05:28.840> two<00:05:29.020> we<00:05:29.860> think<00:05:30.900> 82,000

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
four and three and two we think 82,000

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.499 
four and three and two we think 82,000
is<00:05:32.020> the<00:05:32.169> only<00:05:32.710> number<00:05:33.220> that<00:05:33.250> can<00:05:34.210> be<00:05:34.240> written

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:34.509 
is the only number that can be written

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:38.370 
is the only number that can be written
like<00:05:34.960> this<00:05:35.380> up<00:05:36.310> to<00:05:36.669> base<00:05:36.969> five<00:05:37.270> so<00:05:37.960> there<00:05:38.110> can't

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
like this up to base five so there can't

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.040 
like this up to base five so there can't
be<00:05:38.500> one<00:05:38.830> that<00:05:38.979> satisfies<00:05:39.490> this<00:05:39.729> for<00:05:40.509> base<00:05:40.659> six

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
be one that satisfies this for base six

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.659 
be one that satisfies this for base six
as<00:05:41.320> well<00:05:41.530> because<00:05:41.800> it<00:05:41.860> has<00:05:41.919> to<00:05:42.099> society<00:05:42.610> all

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
as well because it has to society all

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:44.730 
as well because it has to society all
the<00:05:42.699> others<00:05:43.030> it's<00:05:43.479> an<00:05:43.630> open<00:05:43.930> problem<00:05:44.139> it's

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
the others it's an open problem it's

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.680 
the others it's an open problem it's
still<00:05:45.099> an<00:05:45.219> open<00:05:45.310> problem<00:05:45.729> and<00:05:46.150> we<00:05:46.389> have

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
still an open problem and we have

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.070 
still an open problem and we have
checked<00:05:47.139> numbers<00:05:47.919> up<00:05:48.580> to<00:05:49.000> two<00:05:49.300> thousand

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
checked numbers up to two thousand

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.680 
checked numbers up to two thousand
digits<00:05:50.500> long<00:05:50.800> so<00:05:51.490> we<00:05:51.610> have<00:05:51.759> looked<00:05:52.090> for<00:05:52.389> this

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
digits long so we have looked for this

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.159 
digits long so we have looked for this
is<00:05:52.990> it<00:05:53.620> the<00:05:53.800> only<00:05:54.099> number<00:05:54.460> and<00:05:54.969> then<00:05:55.479> if<00:05:55.719> there

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:56.169 
is it the only number and then if there

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:59.070 
is it the only number and then if there
is<00:05:56.259> another<00:05:56.560> number<00:05:56.800> is<00:05:57.330> that<00:05:58.330> number<00:05:58.900> a

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
is another number is that number a

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.350 
is another number is that number a
candidate<00:05:59.830> for<00:06:00.460> the<00:06:00.550> next<00:06:00.729> number<00:06:01.150> in<00:06:01.240> this

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
candidate for the next number in this

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.850 
candidate for the next number in this
sequence<00:06:01.960> because<00:06:02.199> I<00:06:02.229> take<00:06:02.500> that<00:06:02.650> a<00:06:02.710> step

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
sequence because I take that a step

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.529 
sequence because I take that a step
further<00:06:03.039> and<00:06:03.849> look<00:06:04.000> at<00:06:04.090> base<00:06:04.330> six<00:06:04.750> then

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
further and look at base six then

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:08.820 
further and look at base six then
