00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.279
 Welcome to business here 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:23.140
 gadgets point my name is imam and 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.039
 Today I present the unboxing of the 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.320
 leica d lux 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.989
 when we get the camera out of the same 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.239
 Many people will take cardboard 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:35.080
 I think I know the camera 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:37.720
 but what some do not know the whole 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.809
 was a community project with leica 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:44.620
 and panasonic leica offers just that 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:48.280
 same camera under its own name 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.949
 but more about that in our test lab 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.500
 Cardboard in itself, leica is typical in the 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:57.010
 finish with the gray 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:02.019
 product name bio light intensity of the 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:04.030
 Objective is 2840 but hold and yourself 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:08.070
 longer with the cardboard and look 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.869
 right into the box 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.330
 We would like to take this opportunity once 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.080
 at leica for sending the camera 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.190
 thank 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:21.100
 in applied our firm, we will 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.930
 of course the photo qualities and the 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.390
 consider video qualities at this 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.000
 Camera can record a lot 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.189
 but now only a few words too 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.619
 accessories here we have a digital 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:39.759
 instructions on cd a guarantee ina white to 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:42.490
 camera and here again one 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.750
 printed instructions which certainly very 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.280
 nice because 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.530
 one is on the way a little bit space 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.180
 you want to save in luggage and you laptop 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.850
 with cd drive then you can only 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.530
 the take away also but that should 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.580
 Everyone decide for themselves because sometimes 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.990
 it's good 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:02.510
 to have a paper instruction with you 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.950
 make me so once more the cardboard box on 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.500
 here is already pointed out what 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.380
 should be in camera clearly the 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.910
 camera view the battery the charger 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:16.580
 a usb cable an old band a lenz 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.850
 Cover a landshut with a cover 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.620
 for the car and a instructions for use 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.280
 that has me already the cd with the 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.989
 instructions and a warranty card like that 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.620
 Let's start at the side 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.300
 then we have a micro USB cable here 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.650
 I will not take that out now I'll leave it 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.810
 that now of my packaging and that 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.200
 I will not need then we have 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.150
 here re-feed a power cable 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.170
 foreign electricity network legally for 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:51.920
 which I'm not sure then 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:53.420
 we have the charger here similar 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.420
 certainly with the sister model with 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.420
 the panasonic fz 1900 percent identical 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.140
 jens dead 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.180
 I take time out to us 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.850
 I show the same as the s.der 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:17.299
 Camera looks like we have here 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:21.520
 A power cable for England's cover 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:24.460
 The lens also on 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.250
 with a small cable who can 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.840
 namely attach to the camera 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:33.280
 so you do not lose that I have to 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:37.150
 not now and then you still have to 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.640
 be a German rum cable in it something 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.570
 Of course, I am very happy at this point 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.840
 think nice 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:46.210
 in all honesty who is a 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.580
 digital camera usually buys it too 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.110
 and again on vacation and 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.940
 that you are already here with the 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.330
 corresponding adapter cable supplied 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.980
 becomes 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:58.060
 you do not need to worry about that now 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:00.790
 that you can not find the right one somewhere 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.710
 Connection has so that only synonymous 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:08.980
 the seeds and look something here 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:13.300
 on the side of the camera battery that is 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:22.260
 have a 1200 milliampere battery here 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:25.060
 a pretty wide day one the whole 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:28.000
 beautifully designed with leica logo 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.700
 of course, very high class sit 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.830
 in there because I do not need it 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.110
 and then we take a look at the camera 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.610
 even on 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.610
 Also packed very well 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:51.110
 this a bit already briefly 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:51.110
 battery cover Attach one the accordion 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:59.340
 secures the camera lens yes like me 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:02.490
 I mention start to many 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.680
 the camera have ever seen 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:09.060
 but not with a logo but 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:11.810
 with a panasonic branding the cameras 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.340
 in themselves are absolutely identical 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.110
 where now the only difference 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.580
 that we will surely look again, though 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.240
 I think that should not be found 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.790
 his 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:24.140
 the arrangement of the buttons is with the 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:27.150
 sister model fz 1000 absolutely similar 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:31.250
 feels the same way 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:33.390
 also absolutely identical in weight 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.490
 We will be amon in our test 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:39.840
 show if there is a small one somewhere 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:41.910
 difference to the fz 1000 but gives that 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.890
 will then be our test show 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.890
 here again on our youtube 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:49.430
 channel a corresponding video tests 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:52.410
 show and then there is on our blog 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:55.910
 a two-part test series once for 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.960
 video functionality and once to 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.419
 efficiency in the photo area 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.210
 then we leave that at this point 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:04.550
 once and i would like it for me 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.020
 thank the audience 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.340
 and if you liked this video 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.260
 then there's a thumb for the whole thing 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:14.030
 high and if it has not already done so 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.030
