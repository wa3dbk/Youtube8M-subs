takes<00:01:39.119> pretty<00:01:40.119> lightweight<00:01:40.409> now<00:01:41.409> this<00:01:41.560> uses<00:01:41.740> a

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
takes pretty lightweight now this uses a

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.560 
takes pretty lightweight now this uses a
lot<00:01:42.100> of<00:01:42.219> stake<00:01:42.429> so<00:01:42.609> it's<00:01:42.759> not<00:01:42.939> a<00:01:43.000> free<00:01:43.240> standing

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
lot of stake so it's not a free standing

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.959 
lot of stake so it's not a free standing
tent<00:01:43.960> per<00:01:44.619> se<00:01:44.829> and<00:01:45.990> then<00:01:46.990> you<00:01:47.170> have<00:01:47.350> the<00:01:47.969> tent

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:48.969 
tent per se and then you have the tent

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:51.779 
tent per se and then you have the tent
body<00:01:49.119> itself<00:01:49.569> the<00:01:50.530> mesh<00:01:50.710> netting<00:01:50.979> and<00:01:51.670> then

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
body itself the mesh netting and then

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:52.880 
body itself the mesh netting and then
you<00:01:51.880> have<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.119> rain<00:01:52.240> fly

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
you have the rain fly

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.590 
you have the rain fly
okay<00:01:53.890> so<00:01:53.950> this<00:01:54.159> is<00:01:54.310> what<00:01:54.429> the<00:01:54.520> rain<00:01:54.670> fly

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.740 

that's<00:01:59.200> just<00:01:59.470> the<00:02:00.360> tan<00:02:01.360> body<00:02:01.600> itself<00:02:03.690> as<00:02:04.690> you

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
that's just the tan body itself as you

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.330 
that's just the tan body itself as you
can<00:02:04.840> see<00:02:05.050> it's<00:02:05.170> fairly<00:02:05.350> small

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
can see it's fairly small

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.160 
can see it's fairly small
not<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.119> biggest<00:02:08.300> tent<00:02:08.600> in<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.750> world<00:02:08.929> but

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
not the biggest tent in the world but

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.920 
not the biggest tent in the world but
it's<00:02:09.289> not<00:02:09.440> design<00:02:09.770> part<00:02:10.009> either

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.140 

is<00:02:14.709> the<00:02:14.860> rumor<00:02:17.129> so<00:02:18.129> if<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.430> thermo<00:02:18.670> is<00:02:18.909> the

a size notice again it's really not that
roomy<00:02:27.730> but<00:02:28.180> it's<00:02:28.709> probably<00:02:29.709> sufficient<00:02:30.579> for

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
roomy but it's probably sufficient for

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:41.630 
roomy but it's probably sufficient for
one<00:02:31.030> person

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:38.659 
know if you want to fit two people on
your<00:04:35.729> I<00:04:35.849> suppose<00:04:36.150> you<00:04:36.360> could<00:04:36.630> in<00:04:36.810> a<00:04:36.870> pinch<00:04:37.669> if

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
your I suppose you could in a pinch if

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:40.339 
your I suppose you could in a pinch if
you're<00:04:38.880> cozy<00:04:39.300> with<00:04:39.419> your<00:04:39.539> tent<00:04:39.810> mate<00:04:39.990> but
