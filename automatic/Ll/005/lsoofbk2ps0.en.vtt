what<00:00:00.510> we're<00:00:00.659> gonna<00:00:00.719> do<00:00:01.050> is<00:00:01.199> we're<00:00:01.319> going<00:00:01.410> to

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:01.500 
what we're gonna do is we're going to

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.169 
what we're gonna do is we're going to
take<00:00:01.680> three<00:00:02.159> different<00:00:02.250> backs<00:00:02.700> we'll<00:00:02.970> take<00:00:03.149> a

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
take three different backs we'll take a

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:04.940 
take three different backs we'll take a
wood<00:00:03.449> bat<00:00:03.629> just<00:00:03.929> like<00:00:04.140> the<00:00:04.290> pro<00:00:04.470> guys<00:00:04.680> use

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
wood bat just like the pro guys use

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.099 
wood bat just like the pro guys use
we'll<00:00:05.549> take<00:00:05.730> the<00:00:05.910> black<00:00:06.029> Buddha<00:00:06.509> bat<00:00:06.779> that<00:00:07.020> we

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
we'll take the black Buddha bat that we

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.200 
we'll take the black Buddha bat that we
use<00:00:07.319> last<00:00:07.649> year<00:00:07.980> and<00:00:08.130> then<00:00:08.250> this<00:00:08.610> year's<00:00:08.940> new

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
use last year and then this year's new

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.600 
use last year and then this year's new
model<00:00:09.630> with<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.929> BB<00:00:10.230> core<00:00:10.469> testing<00:00:10.980> what

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
model with the BB core testing what

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.310 
model with the BB core testing what
we'll<00:00:11.790> find<00:00:12.030> is<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.480> differential<00:00:13.080> in<00:00:13.230> the

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
we'll find is the differential in the

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.259 
we'll find is the differential in the
bat<00:00:13.500> screw<00:00:13.799> that<00:00:13.920> comes<00:00:14.099> off<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.580> each<00:00:14.759> all

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
bat screw that comes off of each all

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:15.980 
bat screw that comes off of each all
right<00:00:15.389> guys

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
right guys

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.590 
right guys
start<00:00:16.350> with<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.529> wood<00:00:16.970> and<00:00:17.970> what<00:00:18.180> these<00:00:18.390> guys

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
start with a wood and what these guys

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.750 
start with a wood and what these guys
will<00:00:18.869> do<00:00:18.990> is<00:00:19.140> they'll<00:00:19.380> do<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.039> test<00:00:20.400> and

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
will do is they'll do a test and

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.910 
will do is they'll do a test and
whatever<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.330> difference<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.199> weights<00:00:22.650> to

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
whatever the difference is it weights to

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.130 
whatever the difference is it weights to
about<00:00:23.160> five<00:00:23.490> feet<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:23.970> care<00:00:24.180> if<00:00:24.840> you<00:00:24.930> take<00:00:25.080> a

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
about five feet of care if you take a

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.130 
about five feet of care if you take a
wood<00:00:25.380> bat<00:00:25.560> compared<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.460> last<00:00:27.300> year's<00:00:27.660> model

there'll be a five to seven mile an hour

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.900 
there'll be a five to seven mile an hour
difference<00:00:30.150> which<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.900> about<00:00:31.109> 25<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:32.040> 35<00:00:32.550> feet

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
several years has been about nine to

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.639 
several years has been about nine to
seven<00:01:48.090> baseball<00:01:48.780> purists<00:01:49.229> they<00:01:49.259> like<00:01:49.500> the

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
seven baseball purists they like the

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.410 
seven baseball purists they like the
wood<00:01:49.799> bat<00:01:49.979> that's<00:01:50.159> marbled<00:01:50.610> with<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.939> but

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
wood bat that's marbled with that but

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.609 
wood bat that's marbled with that but
that<00:01:51.509> first<00:01:51.659> were<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.899> little<00:01:52.049> surprised<00:01:52.439> I

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
that first were a little surprised I

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.170 
that first were a little surprised I
mean<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.950> was<00:01:53.040> so<00:01:53.189> sudden<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.820> matter-of-fact

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
mean it was so sudden a matter-of-fact

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.760 
mean it was so sudden a matter-of-fact
thing<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.899> they<00:01:54.990> just<00:01:55.140> went<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.439> this<00:01:55.530> bat

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
thing that they just went to this bat

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.730 
thing that they just went to this bat
right<00:01:56.399> away<00:01:56.610> but<00:01:57.420> we<00:01:57.659> took<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.110> with<00:01:58.710> a

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
right away but we took it in with a

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.190 
right away but we took it in with a
grain<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:58.979> salt<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.520> we<00:02:00.210> just<00:02:00.420> continued<00:02:00.990> work

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
grain of salt and we just continued work

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.230 
grain of salt and we just continued work
and<00:02:01.439> perfect<00:02:02.340> our<00:02:02.490> swings<00:02:02.790> as<00:02:02.880> much<00:02:03.060> as<00:02:03.149> it

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
and perfect our swings as much as it

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.030 
and perfect our swings as much as it
began<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.960> nothing's<00:02:04.530> really<00:02:04.590> changed

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
began and and nothing's really changed

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.310 
began and and nothing's really changed
so<00:02:05.130> far<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.610> think<00:02:06.210> with<00:02:06.390> these<00:02:06.570> bats<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:07.200> have

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
so far I think with these bats you have

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.249 
so far I think with these bats you have
to<00:02:07.469> focus<00:02:07.680> more<00:02:08.129> on<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.819> right<00:02:09.090> swing<00:02:09.479> rather

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
to focus more on the right swing rather

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.899 
to focus more on the right swing rather
swinging<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:10.799> I<00:02:10.950> mean<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.370> can<00:02:11.400> have<00:02:11.640> big

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:11.909 
swinging it I mean you can have big

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:13.339 
swinging it I mean you can have big
strong<00:02:12.180> guys<00:02:12.390> just<00:02:12.689> go<00:02:12.780> out<00:02:12.870> there<00:02:13.019> and<00:02:13.080> swing

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
strong guys just go out there and swing

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.020 
strong guys just go out there and swing
as<00:02:13.500> hard<00:02:13.530> as<00:02:13.739> they<00:02:13.830> can<00:02:13.890> but<00:02:14.489> with<00:02:14.640> these<00:02:14.760> bets

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
as hard as they can but with these bets

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.140 
as hard as they can but with these bets
you<00:02:15.180> really<00:02:15.390> have<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.689> focus<00:02:15.900> on<00:02:16.319> mechanics<00:02:17.150> in

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
you really have to focus on mechanics in

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.940 
you really have to focus on mechanics in
order<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.659> get<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.930> flight<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.200> would<00:02:19.650> with

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
order to get the flight you would with

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.979 
order to get the flight you would with
the<00:02:19.980> old<00:02:20.489> fence<00:02:20.790> when<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.209> ball<00:02:21.420> hits<00:02:21.720> about

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
the old fence when the ball hits about

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.319 
the old fence when the ball hits about
the<00:02:22.319> bat<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:23.010> aluminum<00:02:23.430> of<00:02:23.549> the<00:02:23.670> bat<00:02:23.819> flexes

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
the bat the aluminum of the bat flexes

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:27.050 
the bat the aluminum of the bat flexes
they've<00:02:24.629> found<00:02:24.870> through<00:02:25.620> technology<00:02:26.280> in<00:02:26.909> the

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
they've found through technology in the

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.630 
they've found through technology in the
last<00:02:27.269> several<00:02:27.599> years<00:02:27.720> how<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.310> develop<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.400> bat

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
last several years how to develop a bat

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.550 
last several years how to develop a bat
it's<00:02:30.239> made<00:02:30.390> out<00:02:30.569> of<00:02:30.599> aluminum<00:02:30.659> that<00:02:31.379> has<00:02:31.530> a

what<00:02:40.739> I<00:02:40.769> understand<00:02:41.189> the<00:02:41.310> BB<00:02:41.700> for<00:02:41.970> testing

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
what I understand the BB for testing

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.920 
what I understand the BB for testing
tests<00:02:43.680> more<00:02:43.859> the<00:02:44.069> rebound<00:02:44.519> effect<00:02:44.810> then<00:02:45.810> it

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
tests more the rebound effect then it

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.309 
tests more the rebound effect then it
does<00:02:46.109> actually<00:02:46.349> ball<00:02:46.799> velocity<00:02:47.340> off<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.609> bat

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319

we've<00:02:49.319> hit<00:02:49.560> seven<00:02:49.920> home<00:02:49.950> runs<00:02:50.310> in<00:02:50.609> four<00:02:51.299> games

we've hit seven home runs in four games
that<00:02:52.379> keeps<00:02:52.769> us<00:02:52.980> on<00:02:53.159> pace<00:02:53.459> to<00:02:53.849> hit<00:02:54.000> over<00:02:54.269> a

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
that keeps us on pace to hit over a

that keeps us on pace to hit over a
hundred<00:02:54.690> I<00:02:54.870> don't<00:02:55.139> think<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.799> anybody<00:02:56.190> in

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
hundred I don't think that anybody in

hundred I don't think that anybody in
the<00:02:56.430> country<00:02:56.760> this<00:02:56.879> year<00:02:56.940> will<00:02:57.239> do<00:02:57.359> that<00:02:57.599> maybe

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
the country this year will do that maybe

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.520 
the country this year will do that maybe
we're<00:02:58.290> that<00:02:58.470> good<00:02:58.709> so<00:02:59.220> far<00:02:59.459> we<00:02:59.639> haven't<00:02:59.849> seen<00:03:00.530> a

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
we're that good so far we haven't seen a

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.920 
we're that good so far we haven't seen a
major<00:03:02.250> difference<00:03:02.639> we<00:03:02.970> know<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.480> difference

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
major difference we know the difference

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.960 
major difference we know the difference
exists<00:03:04.409> because<00:03:04.560> of<00:03:04.739> this<00:03:05.040> stuff<00:03:05.280> there's<00:03:05.760> no

exists because of this stuff there's no
