00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:02.109
 Lorenzo Ramirez and humphead Dr. 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.239

 life changed your life and let's see 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.030
 because he says that they changed his life 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.619
 when you saw they did the 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.740
 surgery they found in his liver 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:17.470
 good mainly she was operated by 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.289
 the liver fatty liver problem 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.299
 fatty is the infiltration of fat inside 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:23.649
 of the liver say that she is chubby and the 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.360
 liver is also chubby all the 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.399
 body infiltrates the fat and 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.090
 mainly binds the liver is the 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:33.220
 main laboratory of the organism and 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.590
 if it is infiltrated of fat it begins to 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.440
 malfunction when we did the surgery 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.869
 we begin to see the liver already salgado 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.539
 I'm just a little doctor because I want to 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:46.049
 introduce yourself to your daughter, I do not think that 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:48.670
 have you been forced to talk 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.600
 perfect let's see to see I want that 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.280
 put the shots look there are you what's up 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.259
 with liver doctor what 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.840
 is there what is it that you notice 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.240
 well there we can see those as lagoons 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.280
 love island what cine 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:08.119
 are the fat deposits inside the 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.840
 liver and normally it 's pinkish smooth 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.330
 but she had those infiltrations 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.090
 perfect so I was tweed now 20 for 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.040
 Here, the normal liver is linked to 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.980
 micro and half federico this is the color 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.690
 real yours was already like that 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.760
 and over time doctor I understand 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.230
 that fatty liver can do 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.750
 this is from this 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.860
 cirrhosis is a liver cancer in others 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.260
 words you can get to do 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.890
 hepatocellular carcinoma with liver cancer 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.709
 time so you have 27 years and one 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.970
 young person with greater predisposition to 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.250
 doing it less predisposing is not 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.920
 true now well let's see some 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.629
 You put yourself here to operate you 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.069
 what were the problems you had 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.049
 before you but what baths of me 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.420
 before I had surgery I had problems 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:58.650
 serious in breathing at night 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.970
 and snored when he slept and drowned me that 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.040
 it's something that alarmed my relatives 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.459
 because it was not normal but then it 's like 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.980
 yes and then my mom what happened what happened 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.420
 because he woke up clear because they thought 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.790
 I was choking, I guess I could not 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.849
 sleep well say I did not feel good 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.560
 nothing but those who watched me if 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.720
 they worried because they say it was 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.910
 too always the chubby ones are going to 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.040
 have crazy discrimination problems 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.160
 and our fund already causes work because 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:29.630
 always see the image always prefer 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.630
 catch someone who has leather 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:37.210
 Let's see I did not know simone not 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.130
 knew the production people the 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.350
 he met I do not see because I really do not 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.300
 super clear change but I want you to see 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.320
 the simone photos there is a photo that you are 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.330
 on the side is not true 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.760
 let's see first that picture let's see 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:52.600
 there you are, how long ago was that 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.390
 picture that was three weeks ago of 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.170
 that summer if that photo was recent 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.340
 now let's go here we can put you aside 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.850
 let's see the two photos and see the 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.820
 difference 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.890
 incredible amazing is that I do not 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.800
 I knew but now you have pictures of 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:13.190
 French 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:16.019
 how is that there is the photo in front and 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.060
 now we see the two people 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.000
 and now wait the surprise comes 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:25.110
 when time has operated total 25 10 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.080
 25 days 25 days the idea is that she 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:31.379
 how much can it be left is to say until 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.479
 how much can they mature in surgery be 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:35.370
 what is the time we do not tell you that 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:37.379
 We wanted this is supposed to 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.090
 the 22 years does not have to see what the 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:40.830
 excess of weight loss until the 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.870
 two years after surgery 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.310
 she can continue to lose weight what 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.710
 normal is that I have already lowered the weight 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.840
 properly and do it slowly 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.240
 so that this does not affect your health 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.009
 now what did they do to him and that 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.539
 I want I want you to see they are going to do 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:56.340
 that's surgery what they did to you 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:57.780
 so that a little bit you understand what it was 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.580
 what happened what was done to him 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.990
 now we did the simon was 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.580
 a technique is not true that the bypass 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.560
 gastric than from the point of view 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.389
 surgical involves two things restriction 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.849
 which is to decrease the size of the stomach 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:11.610
 we decreased it by almost 95 percent 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:13.770
 we leave you a very small stomach with 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.020
 a capacity of 30 cubic centimeters 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.139
 30 cubic centimeters with a question 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:22.650
 you eat good 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:24.509
 I'm following the diet exactly 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.030
 Now I'm eating something that yes I am 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:29.159
 of hunger completely or really be 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.889
 like because I have to do it because if 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:33.389
 you can not compensate the previous week 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:34.590
 I was in the elevator above he told me 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:37.020
 I want to be a bariatric surgery but 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.500
 also appetite change what clear by 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.800
 course of course bone 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:46.250
 this unfortunately if not how I'm going to 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:52.910
 get sick of malnutrition but if I do not see 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:55.340
 food agree not like I do not anymore 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:58.280
 has surprised me because I went to a retreat 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:01.250
 eight days ago and my colleagues that 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:07.250
 they always accompanied me were people who 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:10.700
 a lot happens but never muffler 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:12.470
 in the first ten days of starting 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.030
 perfect let's continue with surgery 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.890
 then that's the first part the 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.140
 restriction we reduce the size of the 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.760
 stomach and the patient loses hunger 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.410
 one because he has a smaller stomach 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.440
 what is the procedure consists of 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.970
 do a malabsorption procedure 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.070
 leaving a bowel gag is a bit 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:31.160
 more elongated and join them to the stomach 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:32.930
 small that we leave doing 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.450
 a concert anastomosis so that the 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:37.820
 stomach can be emptied and can lead 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.440
 the food directly to the 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.360
 interfect is exactly what we are 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.550
 exactly now we are imperfect 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.050
 now for this last part as much as 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.539
 important of all 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.729
 just commented 4 good I feel different 

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:52.879
 we did the truth about everything already had 

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:55.009
 that change my wardrobe full and that's 

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:57.650
 happy women 

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:59.599
 because I put on my already I do not have left 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:02.270
 I have left and for me it was something really 

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:04.610
 very rushed because that in a month , two 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:10.340
 of changing the wardrobe around there goes the 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:12.229
 I work my uniform I do not know how we go 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.419

 to attend directly not like that is not the 

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:37.370
