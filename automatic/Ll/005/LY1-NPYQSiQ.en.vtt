question how does anyone know I mean was

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.330 
question how does anyone know I mean was
anybody<00:00:12.900> there<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.530> observe<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:14.009> well

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
anybody there to observe it well

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.589 
anybody there to observe it well
actually<00:00:14.549> somebody<00:00:14.969> was<00:00:15.120> but<00:00:15.299> I'm<00:00:15.389> getting

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
actually somebody was but I'm getting

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.180 
actually somebody was but I'm getting
ahead<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:15.780> myself<00:00:15.870> check<00:00:16.350> this<00:00:16.500> out<00:00:16.680> first<00:00:17.039> of

present it's through observational
science<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:36.809> find<00:00:37.050> cures<00:00:37.320> for<00:00:37.530> diseases

and build space shuttle's stuff like

and build space shuttle's stuff like
that

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
that

that
now<00:00:40.230> through<00:00:40.800> historical<00:00:41.370> science<00:00:41.760> we

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
now through historical science we

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.700 
now through historical science we
consider<00:00:42.660> things<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.200> happened<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:43.620> the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
consider things that happened in the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.200 
consider things that happened in the
past<00:00:43.890> but<00:00:44.219> they<00:00:44.370> cannot<00:00:44.550> be<00:00:44.730> checked<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.120> the

past but they cannot be checked in the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.420 
past but they cannot be checked in the
same<00:00:45.420> way<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.870> mean<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:46.620> don't<00:00:46.710> have<00:00:46.890> access<00:00:47.100> to

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
same way I mean we don't have access to

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.830 
same way I mean we don't have access to
the<00:00:47.550> past<00:00:47.760> like<00:00:47.940> we<00:00:48.030> do<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.239> present<00:00:48.600> because

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
the past like we do the present because

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.380 
the past like we do the present because
well<00:00:49.140> it's<00:00:49.739> gone<00:00:49.920> right<00:00:50.370> all<00:00:50.760> we<00:00:51.000> really<00:00:51.210> have

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
well it's gone right all we really have

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.810 
well it's gone right all we really have
a<00:00:51.420> speculation<00:00:52.140> or<00:00:52.350> at<00:00:52.500> best<00:00:52.820> circumstantial

evidences of past events based on what

evidences of past events based on what
we<00:00:56.100> see<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.579> present<00:00:56.969> that's<00:00:57.300> not<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.539> say

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
we see in the present that's not to say

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.090 
we see in the present that's not to say
that<00:00:57.780> we<00:00:57.930> can't<00:00:58.140> make<00:00:58.289> intelligent<00:00:58.590> guesses

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
that we can't make intelligent guesses

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.160 
that we can't make intelligent guesses
about<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.550> past<00:00:59.820> or<00:01:00.300> form<00:01:00.660> reasonable

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
about the past or form reasonable

about the past or form reasonable

inferences from rocks or fossils in the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000 
inferences from rocks or fossils in the
present<00:01:03.359> but<00:01:03.690> we<00:01:03.780> certainly<00:01:03.960> cannot<00:01:04.379> directly

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
present but we certainly cannot directly

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.590 
present but we certainly cannot directly
test<00:01:05.250> our<00:01:05.430> conclusions<00:01:05.970> because<00:01:06.270> we<00:01:06.390> cannot

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
test our conclusions because we cannot

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.560 
test our conclusions because we cannot
repeat<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.140> past<00:01:07.380> got<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:08.939> does<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.390> mean

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
repeat the past got it so does that mean

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.810 
repeat the past got it so does that mean
historical<00:01:10.140> science<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.560> unimportant<00:01:11.070> not<00:01:11.700> at

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
historical science is unimportant not at

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.700 
historical science is unimportant not at

just<00:01:30.659> told<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.960> was<00:01:31.079> true<00:01:31.380> but<00:01:31.829> how<00:01:32.250> do<00:01:32.310> we

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
just told you was true but how do we

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.050 
just told you was true but how do we
test<00:01:32.700> it

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
test it

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.390 
test it
well<00:01:33.630> applying<00:01:34.020> observational<00:01:34.799> science<00:01:35.250> we

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
well applying observational science we

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.039 
well applying observational science we
can<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.729> course<00:01:35.759> observe<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.720> Eiffel<00:01:37.020> Tower

so<00:02:20.770> does<00:02:21.160> observational<00:02:21.760> science<00:02:22.120> confirm

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
so does observational science confirm

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.910 
so does observational science confirm
that<00:02:22.570> the<00:02:22.690> world<00:02:22.870> was<00:02:23.050> created<00:02:23.200> by<00:02:23.470> God<00:02:23.680> and

that the world was created by God and

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.770 
that the world was created by God and
are<00:02:24.370> they're<00:02:24.550> trustworthy<00:02:24.910> documents<00:02:25.660> and

are they're trustworthy documents and
eyewitness<00:02:26.170> accounts<00:02:26.530> to<00:02:26.620> confirm<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:27.130> well
