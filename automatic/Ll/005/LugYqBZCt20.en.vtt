let you see what it sounds like the

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.590 
let you see what it sounds like the
first<00:00:34.989> step<00:00:35.260> of<00:00:35.640> replacing<00:00:36.640> any<00:00:36.790> factory<00:00:37.330> horn

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
first step of replacing any factory horn

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.380 
first step of replacing any factory horn
is<00:00:38.320> to<00:00:38.500> get<00:00:38.650> it<00:00:38.769> out<00:00:38.890> of<00:00:39.010> the<00:00:39.070> vehicle<00:00:39.390> I've

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
is to get it out of the vehicle I've

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.119 
is to get it out of the vehicle I've
gone<00:00:40.600> ahead<00:00:40.750> and<00:00:40.900> taken<00:00:41.110> this<00:00:41.379> one<00:00:41.620> out<00:00:41.769> so<00:00:42.070> you

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
gone ahead and taken this one out so you

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:43.470 
gone ahead and taken this one out so you
can<00:00:42.280> see<00:00:42.430> what<00:00:42.550> was<00:00:42.640> going<00:00:42.850> on<00:00:42.940> because<00:00:43.300> it's

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
can see what was going on because it's

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.390 
can see what was going on because it's
very<00:00:43.750> deep<00:00:44.019> in<00:00:44.199> this<00:00:44.290> fender<00:00:44.680> they're<00:00:45.040> not<00:00:45.190> all

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
very deep in this fender they're not all

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.250 
very deep in this fender they're not all
in<00:00:45.549> the<00:00:45.640> same<00:00:45.670> location<00:00:46.000> you'll<00:00:46.930> have<00:00:47.140> to

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
in the same location you'll have to

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.810 
in the same location you'll have to
track<00:00:47.500> down<00:00:47.710> the<00:00:47.860> location<00:00:47.890> of<00:00:48.430> where<00:00:48.580> yours

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
track down the location of where yours

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.869 
track down the location of where yours
is<00:00:49.059> so<00:00:50.019> once<00:00:50.320> we've<00:00:50.500> got<00:00:50.530> this<00:00:50.890> out<00:00:51.100> then<00:00:51.760> we

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
is so once we've got this out then we

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:53.310 
is so once we've got this out then we
want<00:00:52.089> what<00:00:52.390> we<00:00:52.479> want<00:00:52.659> to<00:00:52.720> do<00:00:52.809> is<00:00:52.930> just<00:00:53.049> go<00:00:53.229> ahead

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
want what we want to do is just go ahead

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.579 
want what we want to do is just go ahead
and<00:00:53.559> unplug<00:00:53.799> it<00:00:53.920> so<00:00:54.309> that<00:00:54.970> way<00:00:55.239> we<00:00:55.900> can<00:00:56.140> use<00:00:56.320> the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
and unplug it so that way we can use the

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.700 
and unplug it so that way we can use the
factory<00:00:57.100> installed<00:00:57.390> horn<00:00:58.390> wiring<00:00:58.930> which<00:00:59.530> will

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
factory installed horn wiring which will

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.439 
factory installed horn wiring which will
allow<00:00:59.890> us<00:01:00.100> to<00:01:00.129> continue<00:01:00.699> to<00:01:00.729> use<00:01:01.030> our<00:01:01.210> horn

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
allow us to continue to use our horn

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:03.000 
allow us to continue to use our horn
button<00:01:01.750> on<00:01:01.839> our<00:01:01.869> steering<00:01:02.199> wheel<00:01:02.409> what<00:01:02.920> we

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
button on our steering wheel what we

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.039 
button on our steering wheel what we
need<00:01:03.190> to<00:01:03.309> do<00:01:03.489> with<00:01:04.089> our<00:01:04.119> factory<00:01:04.780> wires

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
need to do with our factory wires

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:06.450 
need to do with our factory wires
because<00:01:05.500> we're<00:01:05.650> going<00:01:05.740> to<00:01:05.799> use<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:06.100> factory

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
because we're going to use the factory

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.640 
because we're going to use the factory
horn<00:01:06.729> button<00:01:07.090> let's<00:01:07.690> go<00:01:07.900> ahead<00:01:08.020> and<00:01:08.260> cut<00:01:08.440> these

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
horn button let's go ahead and cut these

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.160 
horn button let's go ahead and cut these
ends<00:01:08.950> off<00:01:09.190> and<00:01:09.460> then<00:01:10.150> we'll<00:01:10.299> need<00:01:10.450> to<00:01:10.659> crimp<00:01:10.960> on

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
ends off and then we'll need to crimp on

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.649 
ends off and then we'll need to crimp on
some<00:01:12.100> of<00:01:12.220> these<00:01:12.310> Spade<00:01:12.700> style<00:01:13.060> connectors

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
some of these Spade style connectors

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.200 
some of these Spade style connectors
onto<00:01:14.500> our<00:01:14.590> wire<00:01:14.799> and<00:01:15.070> the<00:01:15.460> reason<00:01:15.790> why<00:01:15.880> we<00:01:16.060> need

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
onto our wire and the reason why we need

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.370 
onto our wire and the reason why we need
to<00:01:16.240> do<00:01:16.480> that<00:01:16.690> is<00:01:17.650> because<00:01:18.870> our<00:01:19.870> new<00:01:20.110> horn

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
to do that is because our new horn

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.430 
to do that is because our new horn
system<00:01:20.890> has<00:01:21.460> these<00:01:21.790> Spade<00:01:22.180> ends<00:01:22.540> on<00:01:22.660> it<00:01:22.690> for

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
system has these Spade ends on it for

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.260 
system has these Spade ends on it for
negative<00:01:23.980> and<00:01:24.070> positive<00:01:24.640> and<00:01:24.850> we<00:01:24.970> need<00:01:25.150> to

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
negative and positive and we need to

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.050 
negative and positive and we need to
have<00:01:25.360> something<00:01:25.720> other<00:01:26.050> than<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:27.160> original

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
have something other than the original

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.890 
have something other than the original
wire<00:01:28.270> clips<00:01:28.720> which<00:01:29.440> obviously<00:01:30.220> don't<00:01:30.580> fit<00:01:30.970> now

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
wire clips which obviously don't fit now

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.900 
wire clips which obviously don't fit now
depending<00:01:32.620> on<00:01:32.680> what<00:01:32.890> make<00:01:33.100> model<00:01:33.490> vehicle<00:01:33.820> you

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
depending on what make model vehicle you

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.210 
depending on what make model vehicle you
have<00:01:33.940> yours<00:01:34.780> may<00:01:35.020> have<00:01:35.260> style<00:01:35.620> like<00:01:35.830> that<00:01:36.040> or

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
have yours may have style like that or

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.640 
have yours may have style like that or
it<00:01:36.280> may<00:01:36.370> not<00:01:36.600> we're<00:01:37.600> going<00:01:37.810> to<00:01:37.900> go<00:01:38.110> ahead<00:01:38.410> and

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
it may not we're going to go ahead and

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:45.330 
it may not we're going to go ahead and
snip<00:01:39.610> these<00:01:39.850> wires<00:01:40.180> off<00:01:40.540> of<00:01:40.600> here<00:01:41.050> and<00:01:43.440> then<00:01:44.440> in

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
snip these wires off of here and then in

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.450 
snip these wires off of here and then in
this<00:01:46.030> instance<00:01:46.570> because<00:01:47.159> we're<00:01:48.159> not<00:01:48.250> going<00:01:48.400> to

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
this instance because we're not going to

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.000 
this instance because we're not going to
have<00:01:48.580> enough<00:01:48.850> space<00:01:49.270> in<00:01:49.570> between<00:01:49.720> these<00:01:50.140> what

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
have enough space in between these what

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.140 
have enough space in between these what
we're<00:01:51.100> going<00:01:51.220> to<00:01:51.310> have<00:01:51.400> to<00:01:51.520> do<00:01:51.700> is<00:01:51.880> we're<00:01:52.060> going

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
we're going to have to do is we're going

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.780
