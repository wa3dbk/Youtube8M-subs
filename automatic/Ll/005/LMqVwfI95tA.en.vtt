00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:20.440 
in about April 2013 it spread very much

like<00:00:20.650> what<00:00:20.920> I<00:00:20.950> describe<00:00:21.400> as<00:00:21.550> cauliflower<00:00:22.180> so

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:22.780 
like what I describe as cauliflower so

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.380 
like what I describe as cauliflower so
one<00:00:23.020> large<00:00:23.290> spot<00:00:23.770> overnight<00:00:24.490> would<00:00:24.790> sort<00:00:25.330> of

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
one large spot overnight would sort of

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.440 
one large spot overnight would sort of
infect<00:00:25.900> a<00:00:26.020> whole<00:00:26.250> area<00:00:27.250> around<00:00:27.460> the<00:00:27.940> spot<00:00:28.240> and

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.450 
infect a whole area around the spot and

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.060 
infect a whole area around the spot and
you'd<00:00:28.900> have<00:00:28.990> a<00:00:29.050> little<00:00:29.140> cauliflower<00:00:29.530> effect

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
but she was very self conscious of it

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.490 
but she was very self conscious of it
very<00:00:33.520> self-aware<00:00:33.940> she<00:00:34.780> didn't<00:00:35.110> want<00:00:35.320> it

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
very self-aware she didn't want it

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.529 
very self-aware she didn't want it
washed<00:00:35.829> in<00:00:36.129> the<00:00:36.219> bath<00:00:36.399> she<00:00:36.879> didn't<00:00:37.149> want<00:00:37.329> her

00:00:37.529 --> 00:00:37.539 
washed in the bath she didn't want her

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:39.360 
washed in the bath she didn't want her
clothes<00:00:37.899> rubbing<00:00:38.410> on<00:00:38.559> the<00:00:38.649> certain<00:00:38.980> areas

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
clothes rubbing on the certain areas

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.849 
clothes rubbing on the certain areas
that<00:00:39.550> it<00:00:39.699> her<00:00:40.059> clothes<00:00:40.329> would<00:00:40.600> touch<00:00:40.870> after

00:00:41.849 --> 00:00:41.859 
that it her clothes would touch after

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:44.040 
that it her clothes would touch after
three<00:00:42.070> weeks<00:00:42.219> I<00:00:42.519> had<00:00:42.730> it<00:00:43.179> looked<00:00:43.449> as<00:00:43.719> if<00:00:43.749> it<00:00:43.929> was

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
three weeks I had it looked as if it was

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.709 
three weeks I had it looked as if it was
developing<00:00:44.649> like<00:00:44.920> chickenpox<00:00:45.449> and<00:00:46.449> I<00:00:46.539> thought

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:46.719 
developing like chickenpox and I thought

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:48.329 
developing like chickenpox and I thought
well<00:00:46.870> she's<00:00:47.019> had<00:00:47.199> chickenpox<00:00:47.589> it<00:00:47.949> can't<00:00:48.190> be

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:48.339 
well she's had chickenpox it can't be

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:50.369 
well she's had chickenpox it can't be
chickenpox<00:00:48.640> again<00:00:49.059> it<00:00:49.210> might<00:00:49.390> be<00:00:49.659> it's

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
chickenpox again it might be it's

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.590 
chickenpox again it might be it's
probably<00:00:50.559> not<00:00:51.010> so<00:00:51.909> at<00:00:51.999> that<00:00:52.120> point<00:00:52.329> I<00:00:52.539> decided

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
probably not so at that point I decided

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.540 
probably not so at that point I decided
to<00:00:53.170> make<00:00:53.319> the<00:00:53.469> first<00:00:53.620> trip<00:00:54.010> to<00:00:54.129> the<00:00:54.159> doctors

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
to make the first trip to the doctors

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.259 
to make the first trip to the doctors
took<00:00:55.480> it<00:00:55.569> to<00:00:55.659> my<00:00:55.839> GP<00:00:56.229> and<00:00:56.909> it<00:00:57.909> was<00:00:57.999> a<00:00:58.030> lady

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269

within about six to seven weeks I was

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.020 
within about six to seven weeks I was
thinking<00:01:44.649> this<00:01:44.829> is<00:01:44.890> you<00:01:45.520> know<00:01:45.640> something<00:01:46.000> that

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.690 
thinking this is you know something that
I<00:01:46.180> can't<00:01:46.600> sit<00:01:46.930> here<00:01:47.109> and<00:01:47.170> let<00:01:47.409> watch<00:01:48.280> happen

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.580 
I can't sit here and let watch happen
and<00:01:48.880> it<00:01:49.000> was<00:01:49.090> spreading<00:01:49.719> they<00:01:49.990> started<00:01:50.530> to

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
and it was spreading they started to

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.169 
and it was spreading they started to
develop<00:01:50.679> over<00:01:51.250> her<00:01:51.369> bottom<00:01:51.729> and<00:01:51.909> down<00:01:52.060> the

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:52.179 
develop over her bottom and down the

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:53.669 
develop over her bottom and down the
backs<00:01:52.359> of<00:01:52.479> her<00:01:52.630> legs<00:01:52.869> and<00:01:53.049> I<00:01:53.140> thought<00:01:53.350> this<00:01:53.590> has

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679 
backs of her legs and I thought this has

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:54.330 
backs of her legs and I thought this has
gone<00:01:53.829> too<00:01:54.070> far

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340
