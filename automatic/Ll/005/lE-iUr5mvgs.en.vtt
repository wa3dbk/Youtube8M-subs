00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:30.669 
been a lot of tweaks release recently

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:32.429 
been a lot of tweaks release recently
but<00:00:30.939> none<00:00:31.360> of<00:00:31.390> them<00:00:31.570> I<00:00:31.630> would<00:00:31.869> say<00:00:32.050> to<00:00:32.110> this

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
but none of them I would say to this

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.040 
but none of them I would say to this
standard<00:00:32.710> and<00:00:33.100> you<00:00:33.940> know<00:00:34.059> the<00:00:34.630> last<00:00:34.809> one

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
standard and you know the last one

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.000 
standard and you know the last one
though<00:00:35.140> as<00:00:35.200> good<00:00:35.350> as<00:00:35.440> this<00:00:35.559> I<00:00:35.710> would<00:00:35.829> say<00:00:35.950> is

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
though as good as this I would say is

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.760 
though as good as this I would say is
probably<00:00:36.280> also<00:00:36.520> so<00:00:37.000> i'll<00:00:37.870> quit<00:00:38.170> sharing<00:00:38.559> and

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
probably also so i'll quit sharing and

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:39.930 
probably also so i'll quit sharing and
i'll<00:00:39.130> just<00:00:39.219> show<00:00:39.399> you<00:00:39.430> what<00:00:39.640> this<00:00:39.760> actually

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
so when we slide down on a nap so for

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:47.880 
so when we slide down on a nap so for
example<00:00:46.329> on<00:00:46.719> the<00:00:46.809> settings<00:00:47.199> you<00:00:47.410> can<00:00:47.440> see<00:00:47.739> we

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
example on the settings you can see we

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.829 
example on the settings you can see we
get<00:00:48.039> a<00:00:48.070> pop-up<00:00:48.370> window<00:00:48.670> here<00:00:49.059> of<00:00:49.480> the<00:00:49.600> number

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:49.839 
get a pop-up window here of the number

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:51.060 
get a pop-up window here of the number
of<00:00:49.899> different<00:00:50.199> toggles<00:00:50.589> and<00:00:50.679> we<00:00:50.829> can<00:00:50.980> actually

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
of different toggles and we can actually

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.979 
of different toggles and we can actually
slide<00:00:51.460> between<00:00:51.699> these<00:00:52.089> you<00:00:52.570> can<00:00:52.749> see<00:00:52.899> you

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
slide between these you can see you

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:54.209 
slide between these you can see you
actually<00:00:53.109> have<00:00:53.320> a<00:00:53.350> brightness<00:00:53.859> bar<00:00:54.039> on<00:00:54.129> the

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219 
actually have a brightness bar on the

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:56.250 
actually have a brightness bar on the
bottom<00:00:54.370> as<00:00:54.670> well<00:00:54.699> there<00:00:55.089> so<00:00:55.960> it<00:00:56.019> just<00:00:56.079> gives

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
bottom as well there so it just gives

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.810 
bottom as well there so it just gives
you<00:00:56.409> some<00:00:56.589> really<00:00:56.739> easy<00:00:56.980> access<00:00:57.460> to<00:00:57.519> some

you some really easy access to some

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.029 
you some really easy access to some
toggles<00:00:58.210> there<00:00:58.390> and<00:00:59.140> pretty<00:00:59.289> much<00:00:59.409> all<00:00:59.800> of<00:00:59.980> the

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:00.039 
toggles there and pretty much all of the
