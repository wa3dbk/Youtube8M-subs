be tempted to over knead it you just

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.560 
be tempted to over knead it you just
want<00:04:07.490> it<00:04:07.520> to<00:04:07.610> get<00:04:07.760> back<00:04:07.940> to<00:04:08.180> this<00:04:08.270> nice

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
want it to get back to this nice

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.230 
want it to get back to this nice
workable<00:04:09.170> consistency<00:04:09.760> the<00:04:10.760> reason<00:04:11.090> I<00:04:11.150> only

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240 
workable consistency the reason I only

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.880 
workable consistency the reason I only
work<00:04:11.480> with<00:04:11.660> one<00:04:11.870> third<00:04:12.140> of<00:04:12.170> my<00:04:12.380> mixer<00:04:12.710> at<00:04:12.830> a

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
work with one third of my mixer at a

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.620 
work with one third of my mixer at a
time<00:04:13.100> is<00:04:13.340> because<00:04:13.670> once<00:04:13.910> that<00:04:14.030> dough<00:04:14.300> starts

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
time is because once that dough starts

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.300 
time is because once that dough starts
to<00:04:14.660> warm<00:04:14.870> up<00:04:15.020> too<00:04:15.230> much<00:04:15.380> you<00:04:15.620> need<00:04:15.950> to<00:04:16.070> sit<00:04:16.220> it

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
to warm up too much you need to sit it

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.770 
to warm up too much you need to sit it
back<00:04:16.489> in<00:04:16.700> the<00:04:16.790> fridge<00:04:16.940> for<00:04:17.150> another<00:04:17.239> hour<00:04:17.600> or

back in the fridge for another hour or

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:18.070 
back in the fridge for another hour or
two

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
two

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.330 
two
to<00:04:18.350> get<00:04:18.500> it<00:04:18.620> back<00:04:18.650> to<00:04:19.010> its<00:04:19.100> chilled

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
to get it back to its chilled

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.340 
to get it back to its chilled
consistency<00:04:19.940> to<00:04:20.030> work<00:04:20.239> with<00:04:20.510> so<00:04:20.989> working<00:04:21.200> with

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
consistency to work with so working with

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.110 
consistency to work with so working with
the<00:04:21.530> third<00:04:21.770> means<00:04:22.070> your<00:04:22.370> other<00:04:22.550> dough's<00:04:22.790> still

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
the third means your other dough's still

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.550 
the third means your other dough's still
cold<00:04:23.360> and<00:04:23.480> you<00:04:23.600> can<00:04:23.720> bring<00:04:23.870> it<00:04:23.930> out<00:04:24.110> and<00:04:24.350> work

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
cold and you can bring it out and work

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.870 
cold and you can bring it out and work
with<00:04:24.770> that<00:04:24.800> once<00:04:25.220> you're<00:04:25.400> finished<00:04:25.520> with<00:04:25.730> this

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
with that once you're finished with this

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.300 
with that once you're finished with this
first<00:04:26.150> lot<00:04:26.740> sprinkle<00:04:27.740> down<00:04:27.830> a<00:04:27.890> really

generous<00:04:28.790> amount<00:04:29.150> of<00:04:29.270> that<00:04:29.420> spare<00:04:29.810> flour<00:04:30.110> that

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
generous amount of that spare flour that

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.870 
generous amount of that spare flour that
you<00:04:30.470> had<00:04:30.650> as<00:04:30.830> well<00:04:31.010> as<00:04:31.160> on<00:04:31.280> top<00:04:31.430> of<00:04:31.580> the<00:04:31.700> dough

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
you had as well as on top of the dough

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.630 
you had as well as on top of the dough
and<00:04:32.450> just<00:04:32.810> use<00:04:33.110> your<00:04:33.140> roller<00:04:33.800> just<00:04:34.100> to<00:04:34.280> roll<00:04:34.490> it

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
and just use your roller just to roll it

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.670 
and just use your roller just to roll it
out<00:04:34.820> so<00:04:35.030> you<00:04:35.420> can<00:04:35.540> see<00:04:35.690> how<00:04:35.870> well<00:04:36.170> it's<00:04:36.320> rolling

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
out so you can see how well it's rolling

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.350 
out so you can see how well it's rolling
but<00:04:36.800> I'm<00:04:36.890> also<00:04:37.070> keeping<00:04:37.370> it<00:04:37.640> moving<00:04:37.850> so<00:04:38.060> that

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
but I'm also keeping it moving so that

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.180 
but I'm also keeping it moving so that
it<00:04:38.450> doesn't<00:04:38.720> stick<00:04:39.020> to<00:04:39.230> the<00:04:39.350> bench<00:04:39.590> and<00:04:39.830> so

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
it doesn't stick to the bench and so

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.820 
it doesn't stick to the bench and so
that<00:04:40.310> I<00:04:40.340> get<00:04:40.490> a<00:04:40.520> really<00:04:40.730> nice<00:04:40.880> even<00:04:41.090> thickness

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
that I get a really nice even thickness

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.020 
that I get a really nice even thickness
that's<00:04:42.830> about<00:04:43.070> the<00:04:43.190> thickness<00:04:43.370> I<00:04:43.580> like<00:04:43.760> to<00:04:43.880> go

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
that's about the thickness I like to go

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.420 
that's about the thickness I like to go
