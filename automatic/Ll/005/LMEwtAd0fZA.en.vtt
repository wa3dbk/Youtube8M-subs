hey guys it's will from potato strong
when<00:00:10.020> you<00:00:10.080> start<00:00:10.260> getting<00:00:10.320> older<00:00:10.469> like<00:00:10.800> me<00:00:11.120> you

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
when you start getting older like me you

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.310 
when you start getting older like me you
start<00:00:12.630> thinking<00:00:12.900> about<00:00:12.990> blood<00:00:13.290> pressure

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
start thinking about blood pressure

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.369 
start thinking about blood pressure
cholesterol<00:00:14.270> heart<00:00:15.270> disease<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:15.990> all<00:00:16.080> sorts

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
cholesterol heart disease and all sorts

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.800 
cholesterol heart disease and all sorts
of<00:00:16.440> fun<00:00:16.650> stuff<00:00:18.020> so<00:00:20.240> when<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:21.300> used<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.510> go<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.690> the

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
of fun stuff so when I used to go to the

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.810 
of fun stuff so when I used to go to the
drugstore<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.320> get<00:00:22.500> my<00:00:22.619> blood<00:00:22.890> tested<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.519> mean

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
drugstore and get my blood tested I mean

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.359 
drugstore and get my blood tested I mean
my<00:00:24.000> blood<00:00:24.599> pressure<00:00:24.980> tested<00:00:26.509> it<00:00:27.509> was<00:00:27.660> usually

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
my blood pressure tested it was usually

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.630 
my blood pressure tested it was usually
145<00:00:29.369> over<00:00:29.400> 80<00:00:30.000> or<00:00:30.269> 90<00:00:30.630> something<00:00:31.259> like<00:00:31.410> that

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
145 over 80 or 90 something like that

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.280 
145 over 80 or 90 something like that
114<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:32.790> remember<00:00:32.970> the<00:00:33.210> systolic<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.930> that

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
114 so I remember the systolic and that

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.170 
114 so I remember the systolic and that
was<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.470> bit<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.710> pork<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.400> know<00:00:35.490> from<00:00:36.090> my

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
was a bit I pork you know from my

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.700 
was a bit I pork you know from my
perspective<00:00:38.780> it<00:00:39.780> was<00:00:39.930> pretty<00:00:40.380> much<00:00:40.500> always

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
perspective it was pretty much always

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.320 
perspective it was pretty much always
like<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:42.350> I<00:00:43.730> decided<00:00:44.730> when<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.030> went<00:00:45.270> on

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
like that so I decided when I went on

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.180 
like that so I decided when I went on
the<00:00:45.390> starch<00:00:45.690> based<00:00:45.900> diet<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.470> get<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.650> blood

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
the starch based diet to get a blood

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.980 
the starch based diet to get a blood
pressure<00:00:47.340> monitor<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.240> don't<00:00:48.480> really<00:00:48.780> get<00:00:48.870> to

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:48.990 
pressure monitor I don't really get to

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.310 
pressure monitor I don't really get to
the<00:00:49.080> doctor<00:00:49.350> much<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:50.660> the<00:00:51.660> drugstores<00:00:52.140> not

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
the doctor much and the drugstores not

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.280 
the doctor much and the drugstores not
really<00:00:52.560> close<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:53.280> me<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:54.020> picked<00:00:55.020> up<00:00:55.110> this

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
really close to me so I picked up this

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:01.400 
really close to me so I picked up this
Panasonic<00:00:59.660> blood<00:01:00.660> pressure<00:01:00.840> monitor<00:01:01.290> it's

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
Panasonic blood pressure monitor it's

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.770 
Panasonic blood pressure monitor it's
battery<00:01:01.740> power<00:01:01.950> systolic<00:01:02.940> diastolic<00:01:03.240> and

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
battery power systolic diastolic and

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.840 
battery power systolic diastolic and
your<00:01:03.960> heart<00:01:04.320> rate<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.189> can<00:01:05.400> store<00:01:05.670> some

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
your heart rate and you can store some

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.740 
your heart rate and you can store some
values<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:07.820> so<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.850> thought<00:01:09.060> I'd<00:01:09.210> just<00:01:09.299> do<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.600> a

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
values and so I thought I'd just do it a

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.590 
values and so I thought I'd just do it a
test<00:01:10.110> on<00:01:10.950> camera<00:01:11.340> here<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.520> show<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.390> how

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
test on camera here and show you how

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.100 
test on camera here and show you how
well<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.590> works<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.460> hopefully<00:01:15.420> what

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
well this works and hopefully what

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.280 
well this works and hopefully what
values<00:01:16.440> like<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:17.360> so<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.450> put<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.780> cuff<00:01:19.110> on

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
values like it so you put the cuff on

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.040 
values like it so you put the cuff on
your<00:01:19.410> upper<00:01:19.650> arm<00:01:19.800> so<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.370> know<00:01:20.880> roll<00:01:21.840> up<00:01:21.930> your

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
your upper arm so you know roll up your

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.480 
your upper arm so you know roll up your
sleeve<00:01:22.290> if<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.890> have<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.190> and<00:01:24.740> the<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.310> cable

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
sleeve if you have it and the the cable

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.370 
sleeve if you have it and the the cable
should<00:01:26.700> be<00:01:26.820> on<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:26.970> donor<00:01:27.150> side<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.110> your<00:01:28.200> arm

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
should be on the donor side of your arm

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.870 
should be on the donor side of your arm
so<00:01:28.650> should<00:01:28.860> be<00:01:29.010> in<00:01:29.100> line<00:01:29.310> with<00:01:29.340> your<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.820> know

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
so should be in line with your you know

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.250 
so should be in line with your you know
your<00:01:30.090> thumb<00:01:30.300> size<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:30.980> put<00:01:31.980> that<00:01:32.159> on<00:01:33.140> wrap<00:01:34.140> it

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
your thumb size so put that on wrap it

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.000 
your thumb size so put that on wrap it
around<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:35.670> then<00:01:35.940> your<00:01:36.180> arm<00:01:36.330> is<00:01:36.510> on<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:37.010> table

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
around and then your arm is on a table

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.560 
around and then your arm is on a table
palms<00:01:39.000> facing<00:01:39.360> upward<00:01:41.150> so<00:01:42.150> I'm<00:01:42.240> just<00:01:42.390> going<00:01:42.540> to

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
palms facing upward so I'm just going to

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.410 
palms facing upward so I'm just going to
do<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.440> test<00:01:43.710> here<00:01:43.800> and<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:45.000> will<00:01:45.150> be<00:01:45.270> talking

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
do a test here and I will be talking

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.940 
do a test here and I will be talking
during<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.110> then<00:01:46.200> we'll<00:01:46.650> kind<00:01:46.800> of<00:01:46.890> talk

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
during it and then we'll kind of talk

00:01:46.950 --> 00:02:31.830 
during it and then we'll kind of talk
about<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.430> after

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:40.030 

so<00:02:35.140> you<00:02:36.140> can<00:02:36.290> see<00:02:36.849> 116<00:02:37.849> 1<00:02:38.150> or<00:02:38.269> 74<00:02:38.750> and<00:02:39.050> pulse<00:02:39.830> is

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
so you can see 116 1 or 74 and pulse is

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.960 
so you can see 116 1 or 74 and pulse is
64<00:02:40.690> there's<00:02:41.690> some<00:02:41.840> variation<00:02:42.470> a<00:02:43.129> lot<00:02:43.700> of<00:02:43.819> times

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
64 there's some variation a lot of times

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.089 
64 there's some variation a lot of times
my<00:02:44.150> my<00:02:44.690> pulse<00:02:44.959> is<00:02:45.140> 59<00:02:45.769> something<00:02:46.580> like<00:02:46.670> that

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
my my pulse is 59 something like that

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.880 
my my pulse is 59 something like that
talking<00:02:49.099> can<00:02:49.310> raise<00:02:49.489> your<00:02:49.670> blood<00:02:49.849> pressure

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
talking can raise your blood pressure

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.180 
talking can raise your blood pressure
so<00:02:52.480> yeah<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.599> 116<00:02:54.290> that's<00:02:54.560> you<00:02:54.950> know<00:02:55.040> that's

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
so yeah the 116 that's you know that's

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.080 
so yeah the 116 that's you know that's
we're<00:02:55.580> looking<00:02:55.819> at

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
we're looking at

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.020 
we're looking at
I've<00:02:56.720> been<00:02:56.989> down<00:02:57.140> 107<00:02:57.650> I've<00:02:58.430> been<00:02:58.610> in<00:02:58.730> the<00:02:58.819> 30

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
I've been down 107 I've been in the 30

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:07.890 
I've been down 107 I've been in the 30
point<00:02:59.330> range<00:02:59.569> below<00:02:59.930> what<00:03:00.170> I<00:03:00.200> normally<00:03:00.650> was<00:03:00.799> at

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:18.640 

if<00:03:08.900> we

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.320 

and<00:03:19.190> that's<00:03:19.370> um<00:03:19.610> here<00:03:19.879> you<00:03:19.909> know<00:03:20.120> in<00:03:20.239> the

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
and that's um here you know in the

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:29.140 
and that's um here you know in the
memory<00:03:20.629> storage<00:03:20.989> 105<00:03:23.319> 113<00:03:24.319> 112<00:03:25.220> 116<00:03:25.819> 1<00:03:28.150> 1959
