00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:10.650
 ended up becoming you are one of 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.750
 first authors at amyris on 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.389
 so for many years 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.250
 you are as we know in the 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.650
 pioneers of the collection 12 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.359
 alternative since we already have them 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.789
 gemmotherapy works you have us 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.340
 had given a book on clay in 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.289
 the same 12 alternative collection between 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.640
 time you made us a super of 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.210
 to treat of our soils 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.550
 so this treat geno therapy of course 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.559
 begins with the definition of what 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.719
 a tree and a bud that they are 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.690
 all the analogies that exists between 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.149
 the human being and a tree since we 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.670
 have a bronchial tree inside 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.199
 we also have a tree of life and 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.640
 what is the importance of the bud 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.949
 also at the energy level 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.629
 since we could highlight 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.180
 the energy of the buds by 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.640
 biopic techniques too graphie the 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.140
 treated gemmotherapy describes all 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.670
 buds currently known this makes 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.430
 about fifty bourges have 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.760
 describes all their use how the 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.700
 associate and of course the the the 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.860
 definition also of mythology but 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.659
 also how to understand a bud 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.909
 how to understand all these properties 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.850
 are the whole system and therefore at 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.759
 start you harvest the buds a 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.520
 forest it is harvested you say has 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.439
 all the properties of the plant in 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.610
 somehow in all the wealth of 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.470
 the plant is found in the village 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.270
 that's exactly for the word nice yole 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.579
 everyone knows that the kia the 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.470
 sedatives but the sapwood linden will play 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.060
 a role on the blood depurative side 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.770
 on the elimination of uric acid 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.540
 well the bud is doing all this in 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.210
 same time it contains all the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.590
 properties of the plant from which it comes 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.110
 and that's the interest of the 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.200
 gemmotherapy is a medicine 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.700
 rather global herbal medicine 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.950
 cell is the equivalent of 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.840
 stem cells that are used high 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.579
 level an imam it's a medicine that 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.800
 is safe since abbas 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.780
 concentration and in the bud 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.070
 there are no toxic products so 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.450
 we can use that on long 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.340
 periods like for blackcurrant by 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.710
 example which is an adaptogens is a 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.210
 plant I mean major of the 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.250
 gemmotherapy just as the son is there 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.200
 for example just like rosemary are 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.940
 great medicinal plants that have 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.770
 demonstrates their safety 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.870
 over time and gemmotherapy 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.560
 allows to have a concentrate 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.530
 information 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.240
 it's an informative medicine if you 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.220
 also do not like with active ingredients 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.590
 as some trace elements present 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:39.600
 in buds have of course heard this 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.460
 young man relatively recent therapy in 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.470
 dates from the 50's 60 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.590
 once used buds in 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.430
 traditional herbal medicine 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.340
 mainly to fir buds 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.650
 we are moving bread and one heard the 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.080
 poplar bud that was used 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.090
 mainly in decoction or 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.120
 in the form of ong years of which we knew 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.980
 already some virtues of boujan 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.170
 extremely specific and nobody 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.880
 did not have 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.950
 imagine that we can lose 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.110
 extracts from his buds and this is 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.420
 only recently that we put so his 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.819
 buds macerating in a triple 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.190
 jump wind or high school code rinne for 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.440
 so able to experts not only the 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.080
 active ingredients but also what the 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.959
 henri doctor called the showcase 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.510
 biological energy so potential 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.250
 plants its definition of which of the 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.910
 gemmotherapy is first and foremost 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:34.730
 definition of one and on the energetic 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.239
 before being a doctor of principles 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.890
 assets 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.040
 although active ingredients are 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.500
 interesting is also necessary then 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.560
 the great discovery seoul is we 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.200
 have done is to prove that the 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.269
 bud contains potentially is 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.280
 actually all the properties 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.590
 medicinal of the goodness of the tissues 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.600
 since it is appropriate any information 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.120
 so this leak to therapies 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.850
 global energy cell is a 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.280
 little miracle of nature and just 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.560
 to have used already answered without 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.680
 let's get back to him of course 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.300
 know how to find them and, above all, disavow 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.110
 energy 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.430
 vidal which then contains a bud 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.959
 what is there in the cap 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.370
 since it's a small structure 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.960
 there is a great molecular diversity 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.930
 but any of the low concentrations 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.300
 we do not risk getting intoxicated with 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:33.080
 of course a village jean that possible 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:35.270
 in this attractive tunnel and at the same 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.300
 time in India and the low sutra but 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:41.510
 which of course are also present 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.600
 in the remarks at 7:12 the dance is not 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:48.500
 not because the ring is weak he 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:56.480
 there is no speed that gives him 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:58.930
 put in all hands in 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.930
 all hands 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:08.230
 for m 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:12.510
 dance to take 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.510
 gemmotherapy not against
