00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
WWE title any time in the near future I

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.800 
WWE title any time in the near future I
think<00:02:10.929> that<00:02:11.080> there<00:02:11.260> are<00:02:11.290> guys<00:02:11.590> that<00:02:11.620> will<00:02:12.340> be

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
think that there are guys that will be

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.530 
think that there are guys that will be
considered<00:02:13.810> more<00:02:14.470> than<00:02:14.709> Lord<00:02:15.160> Tensai<00:02:15.430> to<00:02:15.940> be<00:02:16.060> w

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
considered more than Lord Tensai to be w

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.360 
considered more than Lord Tensai to be w
champion<00:02:16.989> I<00:02:17.170> think<00:02:17.980> there's<00:02:18.100> a<00:02:18.160> better<00:02:18.280> chance

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
champion I think there's a better chance

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.370 
champion I think there's a better chance
of<00:02:18.670> someone<00:02:18.850> like<00:02:19.060> Daniel<00:02:19.480> Bryan<00:02:19.720> winning<00:02:20.260> the

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
of someone like Daniel Bryan winning the

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.229 
of someone like Daniel Bryan winning the
title<00:02:20.590> because<00:02:21.100> he's<00:02:21.340> been<00:02:21.489> around<00:02:21.730> more<00:02:22.000> I

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
title because he's been around more I

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.120 
title because he's been around more I
think<00:02:22.959> tense<00:02:23.410> i<00:02:23.560> would<00:02:23.709> have<00:02:23.830> to<00:02:23.860> establish

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
think tense i would have to establish

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.610 
think tense i would have to establish
himself<00:02:24.760> further<00:02:25.209> and<00:02:25.570> stick<00:02:26.079> around<00:02:26.290> for<00:02:26.530> the

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
himself further and stick around for the

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.860 
himself further and stick around for the
long<00:02:26.739> haul<00:02:26.799> before<00:02:27.220> they<00:02:28.030> would<00:02:28.150> consider<00:02:28.360> him

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
long haul before they would consider him

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.509 
long haul before they would consider him
he's<00:02:29.079> only<00:02:29.230> been<00:02:29.410> back<00:02:29.650> for<00:02:29.980> about<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.130> month<00:02:30.310> or

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
he's only been back for about a month or

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.210 
he's only been back for about a month or
two<00:02:30.549> now<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:32.290> be<00:02:32.410> honest<00:02:32.680> with<00:02:32.860> you<00:02:32.980> I

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
two now and to be honest with you I

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.170 
two now and to be honest with you I
don't<00:02:33.280> really<00:02:33.640> think<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.940> characters

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
don't really think the characters

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.210 
don't really think the characters
catching<00:02:35.049> on<00:02:35.200> at<00:02:35.350> this<00:02:35.500> point<00:02:35.769> I<00:02:35.950> mean<00:02:36.040> it's

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
catching on at this point I mean it's

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.910 
catching on at this point I mean it's
been<00:02:36.400> over<00:02:36.640> a<00:02:36.670> month<00:02:36.730> and<00:02:37.410> he<00:02:38.410> beats<00:02:38.650> John<00:02:38.860> Cena

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
been over a month and he beats John Cena

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.790 
been over a month and he beats John Cena
he<00:02:39.340> beat<00:02:39.640> CM<00:02:40.000> Punk<00:02:40.270> and

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
he beat CM Punk and

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.770 
he beat CM Punk and
the<00:02:41.220> crowd<00:02:41.460> hasn't<00:02:41.700> really<00:02:42.030> reacted<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.660> him

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
the crowd hasn't really reacted to him

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.060 
the crowd hasn't really reacted to him
all<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:43.020> much<00:02:43.230> I<00:02:43.350> mean<00:02:43.470> they<00:02:43.530> keep<00:02:43.710> chanting

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
all that much I mean they keep chanting

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.150 
all that much I mean they keep chanting
a<00:02:44.370> train<00:02:44.700> Adam<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.240> I<00:02:45.420> don't<00:02:46.200> think<00:02:46.470> he's<00:02:46.950> seen

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
a train Adam and I don't think he's seen

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.180 
a train Adam and I don't think he's seen
as<00:02:47.310> credible<00:02:47.640> in<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.850> eyes<00:02:47.970> of<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.180> fans<00:02:48.480> yet

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
as credible in the eyes of the fans yet

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.730 
as credible in the eyes of the fans yet
so<00:02:50.190> if<00:02:50.550> that<00:02:50.610> changes<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.690> he<00:02:52.020> starts<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.560> get

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
so if that changes and he starts to get

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.770 
so if that changes and he starts to get
over<00:02:52.890> more<00:02:53.190> with<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.400> fans<00:02:53.640> and<00:02:53.940> he<00:02:54.510> sticks

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
over more with the fans and he sticks

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.800 
over more with the fans and he sticks
around<00:02:54.930> for<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.410> while<00:02:55.610> maybe<00:02:56.610> then<00:02:56.970> that<00:02:57.480> he

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
around for a while maybe then that he

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.860 
around for a while maybe then that he
might<00:02:57.960> have<00:02:58.110> a<00:02:58.200> shot<00:02:58.440> but<00:02:58.740> for<00:02:59.190> now<00:02:59.360> I<00:03:00.360> think

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
might have a shot but for now I think

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.580 
might have a shot but for now I think
it's<00:03:01.170> very<00:03:01.320> unlikely<00:03:02.720> hey<00:03:03.720> don't<00:03:04.140> think<00:03:04.440> this

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
it's very unlikely hey don't think this

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.530 
it's very unlikely hey don't think this
has<00:03:04.740> been<00:03:04.770> asked<00:03:05.280> before<00:03:05.370> which<00:03:06.000> veteran

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
has been asked before which veteran

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.850 
has been asked before which veteran
wrestlers<00:03:06.930> do<00:03:07.080> you<00:03:07.140> think<00:03:07.320> are<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:07.440> best<00:03:07.620> of

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
wrestlers do you think are the best of

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.830 
wrestlers do you think are the best of
putting<00:03:08.130> workers<00:03:08.460> over<00:03:08.760> have<00:03:09.360> a<00:03:09.450> large<00:03:09.660> effect

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
putting workers over have a large effect

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.270 
putting workers over have a large effect
on<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.230> worker<00:03:10.470> they're<00:03:10.590> putting<00:03:10.890> over<00:03:11.100> and

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
on the worker they're putting over and

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.840 
on the worker they're putting over and
most<00:03:11.430> willing<00:03:11.730> to<00:03:11.850> help<00:03:11.940> young<00:03:12.420> talent<00:03:12.930> I

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
most willing to help young talent I

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.030 
most willing to help young talent I
think<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:14.970> perfect<00:03:15.360> example<00:03:15.590> in<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.740> current

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
think the perfect example in the current

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.130 
think the perfect example in the current
WWE<00:03:17.340> roster<00:03:17.640> right<00:03:17.970> now<00:03:18.030> is<00:03:18.390> Chris<00:03:18.690> Jericho

shot<00:04:26.040> from<00:04:26.340> WWE<00:04:27.000> a<00:04:27.090> few<00:04:27.720> years<00:04:27.870> ago<00:04:28.080> during<00:04:28.560> the

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710

feud<00:04:28.980> with<00:04:29.130> Randy<00:04:29.430> Orton<00:04:29.460> I<00:04:29.880> think<00:04:30.720> WWE<00:04:31.080> just

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
feud with Randy Orton I think WWE just

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.300 
feud with Randy Orton I think WWE just
decided<00:04:32.250> that<00:04:32.930> he<00:04:33.930> wasn't<00:04:34.169> really<00:04:34.770> a<00:04:35.010> main

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
decided that he wasn't really a main

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.640 
decided that he wasn't really a main
event<00:04:35.550> caliber<00:04:36.000> guy<00:04:36.150> and<00:04:36.450> that<00:04:36.600> in<00:04:36.810> their

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
event caliber guy and that in their

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.550 
event caliber guy and that in their
minds<00:04:38.130> he's<00:04:38.370> a<00:04:38.400> midcard<00:04:39.210> babyface<00:04:40.169> and<00:04:40.410> that's

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
minds he's a midcard babyface and that's

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.740 
minds he's a midcard babyface and that's
as<00:04:40.710> far<00:04:40.860> as<00:04:40.919> they<00:04:41.100> want<00:04:41.280> to<00:04:41.370> go<00:04:41.460> with<00:04:41.640> him<00:04:41.790> I

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
as far as they want to go with him I

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.750 
as far as they want to go with him I
just<00:04:43.320> don't<00:04:43.530> see<00:04:43.740> him<00:04:43.980> getting<00:04:44.160> a<00:04:44.370> main<00:04:44.520> event

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
just don't see him getting a main event

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.630 
just don't see him getting a main event
push<00:04:44.940> anytime<00:04:45.390> soon<00:04:45.660> I<00:04:45.930> think<00:04:46.560> that<00:04:46.740> he's

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
push anytime soon I think that he's

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.340 
push anytime soon I think that he's
lucky<00:04:48.030> that<00:04:48.060> he<00:04:48.270> is<00:04:48.390> getting<00:04:48.690> somewhat<00:04:49.169> of<00:04:49.260> a

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
lucky that he is getting somewhat of a

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.530 
lucky that he is getting somewhat of a
push<00:04:49.530> right<00:04:49.740> now<00:04:49.800> he's<00:04:50.160> in<00:04:50.190> there

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
push right now he's in there

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.750 
push right now he's in there
with<00:04:50.720> our<00:04:50.990> truth<00:04:51.500> that<00:04:51.740> there's<00:04:52.190> a<00:04:52.310> tag<00:04:52.520> team

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
with our truth that there's a tag team

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.050 
with our truth that there's a tag team
champions<00:04:53.330> so<00:04:53.860> that<00:04:54.860> that's<00:04:55.040> better<00:04:55.880> than

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
champions so that that's better than

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.540 
champions so that that's better than
nothing<00:04:56.180> right<00:04:56.860> but<00:04:57.860> yeah<00:04:57.980> I<00:04:58.040> don't<00:04:58.340> really

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
as a bad thing I think that if you look

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.890 
as a bad thing I think that if you look
back<00:05:45.560> to<00:05:45.770> someone<00:05:46.070> like<00:05:46.160> Hulk<00:05:46.460> Hogan<00:05:46.690> he<00:05:47.690> was

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
back to someone like Hulk Hogan he was

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.020
