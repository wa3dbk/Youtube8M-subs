is<00:01:06.390> no<00:01:06.689> dolphin<00:01:07.080> dive<00:01:07.290> so<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.650> was<00:01:07.830> actually

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
is no dolphin dive so I was actually

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.850 
is no dolphin dive so I was actually
just<00:01:08.369> thinking<00:01:08.490> well<00:01:09.000> maybe<00:01:09.380> you<00:01:10.380> know<00:01:10.500> if<00:01:10.680> we

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
just thinking well maybe you know if we

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.800 
just thinking well maybe you know if we
buy<00:01:11.100> PhD<00:01:11.760> then<00:01:12.000> maybe<00:01:12.210> we're<00:01:12.510> going<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.750> be

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
buy PhD then maybe we're going to be

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.510 
buy PhD then maybe we're going to be
able<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.080> dolphin<00:01:13.500> dive<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:14.010> that's<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.340> way

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
able to dolphin dive so that's a way

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
that we can be able to dolphin dive in

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.890 
that we can be able to dolphin dive in
black<00:01:16.290> ops<00:01:16.470> 3<00:01:16.590> or<00:01:16.950> maybe<00:01:17.939> there<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.479> dolphin

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900

trailers<00:01:33.930> it's<00:01:34.140> sort<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.409> like<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.680> slide<00:01:34.890> on

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100

trailers it's sort of like the slide on
your<00:01:35.250> knees<00:01:35.430> like<00:01:35.759> cod<00:01:35.970> ghosts<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.540> believe<00:01:36.810> and

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
to be honest I'm not really a fan of

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.399 
to be honest I'm not really a fan of
that<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.600> kind<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.930> like<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.229> traditional

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
that I kind of like the traditional

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.950 
that I kind of like the traditional
dolphin<00:01:41.189> diving<00:01:41.430> it's<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.909> lot<00:01:42.150> cooler<00:01:42.360> it's<00:01:42.780> a

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
dolphin diving it's a lot cooler it's a

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.469 
dolphin diving it's a lot cooler it's a
lot<00:01:43.200> more<00:01:43.470> like<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:44.280> know<00:01:44.399> I'm<00:01:44.549> don't<00:01:44.970> going

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
lot more like you know I'm don't going

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.060 
lot more like you know I'm don't going
in<00:01:45.600> hard<00:01:45.840> with<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.200> dolphin<00:01:46.590> dive<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.920> can

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
in hard with this dolphin dive you can

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.550 
in hard with this dolphin dive you can
dolphin<00:01:47.430> dive<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.820> them<00:01:47.939> for<00:01:48.090> any<00:01:48.270> height<00:01:48.750> with

dolphin dive of them for any height with

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.200 
dolphin dive of them for any height with
PhD<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.280> obviously<00:01:50.610> you're<00:01:50.759> gonna<00:01:50.850> still<00:01:51.149> be

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
PhD and obviously you're gonna still be

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.450 
PhD and obviously you're gonna still be
able<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.630> do<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:52.470> know<00:01:52.590> be<00:01:52.770> able<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:53.070> jump<00:01:53.310> off

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
able to do you know be able to jump off

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.160 
able to do you know be able to jump off
buildings<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.119> not<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.750> know<00:01:54.780> get<00:01:55.079> any

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
buildings and not you know get any

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.770 
buildings and not you know get any
damage<00:01:55.649> but<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.189> whole<00:01:56.939> idea<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.299> dolphin

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
damage but the whole idea of dolphin

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.420 
damage but the whole idea of dolphin
diving<00:01:57.990> was<00:01:58.259> just<00:01:58.500> insane<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.219> got<00:01:59.340> me

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
diving was just insane so it got me

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.910 
diving was just insane so it got me
thinking<00:01:59.880> are<00:02:00.329> we<00:02:00.600> going<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.930> be<00:02:01.020> able<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.619> do

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
thinking are we going to be able to do

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.039 
thinking are we going to be able to do
something<00:02:02.219> similar<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.540> dolphin<00:02:03.869> dive

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
something similar to the dolphin dive

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.109 
something similar to the dolphin dive
with<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.350> new<00:02:04.530> movement<00:02:04.950> say<00:02:05.250> for<00:02:05.520> example<00:02:05.610> we

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
with the new movement say for example we

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.479 
with the new movement say for example we
like<00:02:06.329> slid<00:02:06.689> along<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.960> slid<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.009> then<00:02:08.190> when<00:02:08.459> we

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
like slid along a slid and then when we

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.949 
like slid along a slid and then when we
came<00:02:08.789> in<00:02:08.940> contact<00:02:09.119> with<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.420> zombie<00:02:09.750> would

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
came in contact with a zombie would

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:10.760 
came in contact with a zombie would
explode

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
explode

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.990 
explode
or<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:11.250> know<00:02:11.310> something<00:02:11.760> of<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.480> sort<00:02:13.440> of

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
or you know something of that sort of

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.370 
or you know something of that sort of
mechanics<00:02:15.000> so<00:02:15.330> I<00:02:15.540> want<00:02:15.990> to<00:02:16.050> know<00:02:16.140> what<00:02:16.260> you
