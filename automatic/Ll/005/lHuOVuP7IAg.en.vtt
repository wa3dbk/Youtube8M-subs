00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.069
 it's everybody's christ 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.900
 today we find ourselves for 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.780
 breaking news is going to have to really 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.580
 really that I'm taking off spring 2013 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:20.590
 I can not see that you can 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:23.200
 now maybe earn points 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.450
 microsoft or psn is week earlier 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.070
 so I'll put a picture on 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.380
 facebook with because I bought 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.410
 not bad here I mean not buying myself 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.350
 so bad so here you can win 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.489
 now it's super mega cool enough 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.079
 to put a little I like to video that 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.090
 must not forget and then to be a little 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.160
 active on my channel so that's it 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.500
 listen to yeoh little parenthesis too 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.149
 while we're there in west my 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.309
 videos will be shorter since it's me 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:51.249
 asked for it so I see it's good 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.379
 framed so here lille 2 will be a little 

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:55.089
 shorter between 3 to 5 minutes since 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:56.649
 the week in addition to that good there we are 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:57.850
 global threat but would only be the 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.519
 people do not really have the time to 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.879
 watch videos over 10 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.540
 minutes 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:07.180
 finally if they can but it can 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.470
 to complicate on February 20, 2013 is good 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.000
 that in any case he will have something 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.680
 huge at sony's level 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.229
 simply who is a trailer 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.110
 with the end of February 20, 2013 a kind of 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.340
 meeting in new york and so for 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.689
 the moment we do not know they do not have 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.670
 formalized simply that he will 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.780
 see the playstation 4 that will show 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.189
 the playstation 4 but in any case in 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.409
 this trailer can be concluded 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:28.570
 that he will see the playstation 4 that will 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.439
 so out basically what is it 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.990
 that this trailer I'm going to 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:34.689
 to display by video since 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.880
 it's a video of course and so above 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:39.000
 we can simply see the 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.710
 joystick buttons from the playstation 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.259
 so either playstation playstation 2 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.880
 playstation 3 and see the playstation 4 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.890
 we will have to find again thanks to 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.619
 this little trailer so we 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.689
 find the square the circle will have with 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.030
 the cross key and the triangle wanted 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:56.979
 give a very strange hand 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.299
 separate no it was not normal 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.130
 information is all fresh 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.509
 have just come out and so that 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.259
 now the question arises is this 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.190
 that the ps4 will be presented so a kind 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.700
 of 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.330
 pitch in new york on February 20, 2013 at 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.430
 say like m 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.760
 there were a lot of things this year there 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.260
 will have the xbox 720 there will be the ps4 the 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.210
 pesca besides we will see the announce 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.950
 in the soul finally in any case we will see 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.650
 the preview of the console the proto is a 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.310
 prototype before the xbox 720 and so 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.500
 gta5 was in quotation marks as modern 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.610
 warfare 4 that will also go out I will you 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.800
 will speak soon 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.600
 in any case it's four super good 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.790
 thing three super my thing which the 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.710
 currencies by four years by the window 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.990
 because I think it's good 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.460
 is a little past this rap us gta 5 and the 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.900
 new video game platforms that 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.300
 will really interest us for this 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.310
 year street journal will announce one who 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.860
 would come out late that will announce everything 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.780
 so just the japanese firm sony 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.970
 I think we are Japanese is a 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.410
 bullshit but roughly speaking who are well 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.420
 present and will represent them the 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.710
 playstation 4 so there are standards 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.190
 newspapers there are in addition to that they are 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.450
 guests also people and 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.670
 apparently these people there a kind 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.900
 small leak that said low that everything 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.000
 it's just to see the new 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.830
 video game platform at sony is 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.420
 view as what also the playstation case 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.790
 so sony it's just associated 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.930
 with amd you know what we find 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:22.600
 with sort of with the psp and so grosso 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.420
 modo small sketches I do not know 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.160
 what does it really mean there 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.290
 in because some kind of flea he 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.550
 had spoken so we'll see in all 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.710
 case for now there is not really 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.990
 image of 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.510
 it's not France a little bit it's for this 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.270
 kind of things it's so 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.200
 so titanic that frankly we 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.240
 find a little bit of everything 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.560
 what on the net so I do not prepare you 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.530
 start to go up but in any case 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.460
 for the xbox 720 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.320
 apparently I showed you some pictures 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.790
 which is true but for the moment 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.500
 for TV this wrestler nothing at all to 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.610
 apart for that moment it is 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.840
