00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
back on the jaw wrap again flip the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.780 
back on the jaw wrap again flip the
pliers<00:01:24.330> now<00:01:24.690> I<00:01:24.930> could<00:01:25.440> cross<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.770> over<00:01:26.159> but<00:01:26.670> the

that's<00:02:36.030> an<00:02:36.150> oval<00:02:36.540> jump<00:02:36.810> ring<00:02:37.020> because<00:02:37.380> it

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
that's an oval jump ring because it

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.720 
that's an oval jump ring because it
opens<00:02:37.860> on<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.040> side<00:02:39.320> like<00:02:40.320> this<00:02:40.770> then<00:02:41.310> your

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
opens on the side like this then your

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.470 
opens on the side like this then your
piece<00:02:42.030> rests<00:02:42.660> on<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:43.740> oval<00:02:44.490> ends<00:02:45.030> which<00:02:45.300> would

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
piece rests on the oval ends which would

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.910 
piece rests on the oval ends which would
be<00:02:45.600> here<00:02:46.050> and<00:02:46.230> here<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.730> way<00:02:48.620> it's<00:02:49.620> not

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
be here and here and that way it's not

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.120 
be here and here and that way it's not
as<00:02:50.100> likely<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.700> go<00:02:51.030> through<00:02:51.300> the<00:02:51.390> opening<00:02:52.130> so

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
as likely to go through the opening so

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.640 
as likely to go through the opening so
we<00:02:53.370> often<00:02:53.580> view<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.780> oval<00:02:55.050> jump<00:02:55.230> rings<00:02:55.350> are

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
we often view the oval jump rings are

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.310 
we often view the oval jump rings are
stronger<00:02:56.100> just<00:02:56.250> because<00:02:56.730> of<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.330> way<00:02:57.540> the

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
stronger just because of the way the

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.350 
stronger just because of the way the
jewelry<00:02:58.620> sits<00:02:58.890> on<00:02:59.040> them<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.490> make<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.030> smaller

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
jewelry sits on them to make the smaller

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.940 
jewelry sits on them to make the smaller
ones<00:03:00.630> it's<00:03:00.810> really<00:03:01.110> important<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:01.500> know<00:03:01.710> this

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
ones it's really important to know this

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.880 
ones it's really important to know this
little<00:03:02.160> trick<00:03:02.280> here<00:03:02.730> I<00:03:02.910> can<00:03:03.660> wrap<00:03:04.170> this<00:03:04.470> 20

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
little trick here I can wrap this 20

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.530 
little trick here I can wrap this 20
gauge<00:03:05.040> wire<00:03:05.070> so<00:03:05.610> tightly<00:03:05.910> around<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.300> straw

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
gauge wire so tightly around the straw

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.930 
gauge wire so tightly around the straw
it<00:03:06.690> would<00:03:06.810> be<00:03:06.930> hard<00:03:07.110> to<00:03:07.200> get<00:03:07.320> it<00:03:07.440> off<00:03:07.590> but<00:03:07.980> what

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
it would be hard to get it off but what

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.670 
it would be hard to get it off but what
I'm<00:03:09.030> going<00:03:09.300> to<00:03:09.330> do<00:03:09.570> is<00:03:09.750> do<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.050> same<00:03:10.350> technique

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
I'm going to do is do the same technique

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.270 
I'm going to do is do the same technique
of<00:03:11.360> doing<00:03:12.360> a<00:03:12.420> half<00:03:12.630> turn<00:03:13.020> and<00:03:13.260> rotating<00:03:14.070> and

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
of doing a half turn and rotating and

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.630 
of doing a half turn and rotating and
that<00:03:14.760> way<00:03:15.090> I<00:03:15.450> can<00:03:16.320> always<00:03:16.590> get<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.130> jump<00:03:17.400> ring

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
that way I can always get the jump ring

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.050 
that way I can always get the jump ring
off<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:18.810> jaw<00:03:18.990> of<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.320> pliers<00:03:19.730> another<00:03:20.730> thing

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
off the jaw of the pliers another thing

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.060 
off the jaw of the pliers another thing
is<00:03:21.300> if<00:03:21.570> you<00:03:21.810> notice<00:03:22.230> I'm<00:03:22.440> leaving<00:03:22.740> just<00:03:22.890> a

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
is if you notice I'm leaving just a

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.390 
is if you notice I'm leaving just a
little<00:03:23.400> bit<00:03:23.520> of<00:03:23.640> space<00:03:23.910> here<00:03:23.940> as<00:03:24.540> I<00:03:25.080> coil<00:03:25.500> what

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
little bit of space here as I coil what

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.610 
little bit of space here as I coil what
that<00:03:26.610> will<00:03:26.790> do<00:03:26.970> is<00:03:27.240> when<00:03:27.300> I<00:03:27.540> come<00:03:27.840> back<00:03:28.020> in<00:03:28.350> I'm

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
that will do is when I come back in I'm

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.770 
that will do is when I come back in I'm
going<00:03:29.040> to<00:03:29.190> instead<00:03:29.820> of<00:03:29.880> using<00:03:30.240> these<00:03:30.390> shears

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
going to instead of using these shears

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.750 
going to instead of using these shears
which<00:03:31.230> are<00:03:31.380> a<00:03:31.410> little<00:03:31.560> bit<00:03:31.680> big<00:03:32.040> for<00:03:32.310> this<00:03:32.460> and

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
which are a little bit big for this and

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.790 
which are a little bit big for this and
will<00:03:33.450> distort<00:03:33.810> my<00:03:34.020> rings<00:03:34.230> I'm<00:03:34.380> going<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.620> come

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
will distort my rings I'm going to come

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.970 
will distort my rings I'm going to come
in<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.100> use<00:03:35.400> my<00:03:36.150> flush<00:03:36.900> cutters<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:37.650> I'm

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
going to cut the first side and then I'm

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.760 
going to cut the first side and then I'm
going<00:03:42.090> to<00:03:42.150> flip<00:03:42.450> my<00:03:42.480> pliers<00:03:42.930> and<00:03:43.170> I'll<00:03:43.530> let

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
going to flip my pliers and I'll let

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.040 
going to flip my pliers and I'll let
that<00:03:43.800> first<00:03:44.340> little<00:03:44.970> end<00:03:45.570> of<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.870> wire
