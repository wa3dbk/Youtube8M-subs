00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 every owner sooner or later 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.319
 faces the need to replace 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.180
 old bath 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.370
 however it does have some 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.410
 complex and often large 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.269
 material costs since given 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.950
 the procedure is rarely limited only 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.020
 a substitute is usually such a venture 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.560
 results in a full bathroom repair 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.600
 rooms 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.720
 dismantling is almost always associated with 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.189
 spoiling the tiles on the walls and floor 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.859
 Can you imagine how many problems there will be? 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.349
 replacing the old cast iron bath which 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.109
 many years you stood a concrete box 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.859
 precisely for such cases and for many 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.469
 other 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.969
 Special material was developed for 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.969
 bath restoration liquid acrylic 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.629
 let's consider this method more 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.430
 in detail, the master first produces 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.350
 complete cleaning and degreasing 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.719
 bath surface is extremely important 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.670
 otherwise coverage will not be enough 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.559
 strong and durable knit out 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.559
 easily removable disk is used 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.300
 the next important stage is warming up 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.129
 prepared baths 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.200
 need this in order to future 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.910
 acrylic coating most durable 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.910
 grabbed the surface of the bath 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.050
 dedusting follows and 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.330
 dewatering the surface also need 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.040
 dismantle the old harness and the floor in 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.090
 the bathroom to cover the film to 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.810
 liquid acrylic 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.810
 didn't spoil it 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.290
 then we connect the components of the liquid 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.290
 acrylic 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.830
 and after thorough mixing the master 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.690
 starts to pour it on the bath starting 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.520
 from the top of the sides the most important thing 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.040
 be careful not to 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.410
 smudges and floods were formed by 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.780
 rubber trowel master aligns but 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.580
 and removes large bubbles after 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.979
 how the coating will dry will need 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.700
 install a new harness and your bath 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.700
 ready for operation 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.870
 after 36 hours after restoration 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.480
 the gang can already be used not 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.209
 have fun and so we got 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.180
 smooth and snow white bath cover 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.430
 resorts in the track is not difficult work but 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.590
 and that 's not all already developed and 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.200
 The latest generation of enamel is used for 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.640
 bath restoration liquid acrylic 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.500
 enriched with silver nanoparticles 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.239
 this biocidal coating is effective 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.879
 destroying all evil harmful microflora 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.129
 on the surface of the bath whether bacteria 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.660
 or fungi to care for the coating better 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.609
 just use specialized 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.810
