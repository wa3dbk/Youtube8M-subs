00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
what's going on is there's two variables

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.549 
what's going on is there's two variables
affecting<00:00:12.210> what's<00:00:12.960> going<00:00:13.170> on<00:00:13.290> with<00:00:13.380> you<00:00:13.469> all

right one is that when you take a

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.970 
right one is that when you take a
picture<00:00:17.130> in<00:00:17.520> raw<00:00:17.840> your<00:00:18.840> camera<00:00:19.199> still<00:00:19.529> sets

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
the raw file on the back of it you're

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.780 
the raw file on the back of it you're
looking<00:00:37.620> at<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.739> representation<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.550> what<00:00:38.700> the

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
looking at a representation of what the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.770 
looking at a representation of what the
raw<00:00:38.910> file<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.980> now<00:00:41.329> what<00:00:42.329> happens<00:00:42.600> when<00:00:42.719> you

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
raw file is now what happens when you

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.450 
raw file is now what happens when you
put<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:42.989> into<00:00:43.110> your<00:00:43.200> computer<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.129> have<00:00:44.280> to

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
put it into your computer is you have to

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.610 
put it into your computer is you have to
you<00:00:44.969> have<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.239> then<00:00:45.629> bake<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:45.960> or<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.320> have<00:00:46.469> to

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
you have to then bake it or you have to

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.529 
you have to then bake it or you have to
you<00:00:47.250> know<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.399> have<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.670> tell<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.180> parameters

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
you know you have to tell the parameters

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.569 
you know you have to tell the parameters
so<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.379> when<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.680> goes<00:00:49.890> into<00:00:50.160> your<00:00:50.190> computer

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
so that when it goes into your computer

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.799 
so that when it goes into your computer
to<00:00:50.730> go<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.030> with<00:00:51.120> these<00:00:51.270> specific<00:00:51.690> parameters

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
to go in with these specific parameters

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.900 
to go in with these specific parameters
which<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.800> have<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.129> decide<00:00:53.370> that's<00:00:53.640> what<00:00:53.760> was

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
which you have to decide that's what was

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.369 
which you have to decide that's what was
all<00:00:54.120> about<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.719> have<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.989> decisions

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
all about is that you have the decisions

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.900 
all about is that you have the decisions
later<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.219> can<00:00:56.460> switch<00:00:56.640> your<00:00:56.670> white

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
later so you can switch your white

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.970 
later so you can switch your white
balance<00:00:57.199> you<00:00:58.199> could<00:00:58.350> switch<00:00:58.530> your<00:00:58.680> exposure

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
balance you could switch your exposure

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.529 
balance you could switch your exposure
by<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.579> know<00:00:59.670> several<00:00:59.879> stops<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.300> can<00:01:00.420> do

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
by you know several stops you can do

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.900 
by you know several stops you can do
these<00:01:00.660> things<00:01:00.980> but<00:01:01.980> if<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.190> don't<00:01:02.430> do<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.730> your

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
these things but if you don't do it your

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.219 
these things but if you don't do it your
picture<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.390> going<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.539> come<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:03.840> unsaturated

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
picture is going to come in unsaturated

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.039 
picture is going to come in unsaturated
it's<00:01:04.769> going<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.949> come<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.159> with<00:01:05.189> low<00:01:05.400> contrast

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
it's going to come in with low contrast

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.450 
it's going to come in with low contrast
the<00:01:07.049> exposure<00:01:07.409> might<00:01:07.590> be<00:01:07.740> not<00:01:08.010> be<00:01:08.159> exactly

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
the exposure might be not be exactly

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.920 
the exposure might be not be exactly
what<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.700> saw<00:01:08.850> on<00:01:08.880> your<00:01:09.030> camera<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.510> there's

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
what you saw on your camera and there's

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.450 
what you saw on your camera and there's
going<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.110> be<00:01:10.170> little<00:01:10.380> things<00:01:10.560> like<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.860> the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
going to be little things like that the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.539 
going to be little things like that the
other<00:01:11.670> problem<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.740> your<00:01:13.740> monitor<00:01:14.310> is

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
other problem is that your monitor is

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.149 
other problem is that your monitor is
not<00:01:15.240> calibrated<00:01:15.630> I'm<00:01:15.840> guessing<00:01:16.200> if<00:01:16.979> you

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
not calibrated I'm guessing if you

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.679 
not calibrated I'm guessing if you
monitor<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.670> calibrated<00:01:18.119> then<00:01:18.240> nevermind

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
monitor is calibrated then nevermind

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.420 
monitor is calibrated then nevermind
this<00:01:18.810> but<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.799> have<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.009> calibrate<00:01:20.189> your

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
this but you have to calibrate your

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.190 
this but you have to calibrate your
monitor<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.790> have<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.909> get<00:01:21.180> something<00:01:21.630> it's<00:01:22.140> a

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
monitor you have to get something it's a

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.600 
monitor you have to get something it's a
little<00:01:22.409> thing<00:01:22.560> about<00:01:22.740> gay<00:01:22.979> big<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.400> stick

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
little thing about gay big and you stick

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.310 
little thing about gay big and you stick
it<00:01:23.700> on<00:01:23.759> your<00:01:23.790> monitor<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.180> then<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:25.020> reads

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
it on your monitor and then it reads

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.749 
it on your monitor and then it reads
your<00:01:25.530> colors<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.009> makes<00:01:26.220> sure<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.460> your

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
your colors and it makes sure that your

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.580 
your colors and it makes sure that your
colors<00:01:27.030> are<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.990> you're<00:01:28.320> going<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.500> be

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
colors are that you're going to be

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.789 
colors are that you're going to be
seeing<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.270> colors<00:01:30.689> correctly<00:01:31.200> that
