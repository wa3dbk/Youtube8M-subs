00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
a little bit of a hard position

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.220 
a little bit of a hard position
switching<00:03:26.180> to<00:03:26.239> main<00:03:26.359> helps<00:03:26.630> you<00:03:26.750> sit<00:03:27.049> through

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
switching to main helps you sit through

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.199 
switching to main helps you sit through
your<00:03:27.290> doctor<00:03:27.590> to<00:03:27.680> draw<00:03:27.889> in<00:03:28.370> to<00:03:28.519> wield<00:03:28.700> Dona<00:03:28.910> or

your doctor to draw in to wield Dona or

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.629 
your doctor to draw in to wield Dona or
things<00:03:29.870> like<00:03:29.959> that<00:03:30.079> so<00:03:30.530> it's<00:03:30.739> draw<00:03:30.980> power<00:03:31.310> and

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
things like that so it's draw power and

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:32.979 
things like that so it's draw power and
let<00:03:31.760> you<00:03:31.910> get<00:03:32.090> through<00:03:32.389> your<00:03:32.690> neck<00:03:32.870> a<00:03:32.900> little

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
let you get through your neck a little

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.809 
let you get through your neck a little
bit<00:03:33.139> faster<00:03:33.560> yeah<00:03:34.040> you<00:03:34.100> can<00:03:34.340> drill<00:03:34.489> triggers

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
bit faster yeah you can drill triggers

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.849 
bit faster yeah you can drill triggers
along<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.269> way<00:03:35.389> but<00:03:36.260> you<00:03:36.380> know<00:03:36.500> you're

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
along the way but you know you're

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:38.830 
along the way but you know you're
getting<00:03:37.130> down<00:03:37.340> into<00:03:37.730> your<00:03:37.819> deck<00:03:38.060> so<00:03:38.269> the<00:03:38.690> odds

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
getting down into your deck so the odds

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.660 
getting down into your deck so the odds

up that 16 K column I found to be very

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.289 
up that 16 K column I found to be very
beneficial<00:03:45.489> she's<00:03:46.489> still<00:03:46.670> an<00:03:46.730> interceptor

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
very nice I really do like Lancer I

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.950

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
didn't realize how good Lancer was

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.880 
didn't realize how good Lancer was
probably<00:04:29.960> because<00:04:30.230> we<00:04:30.350> didn't<00:04:30.590> have<00:04:30.710> it<00:04:30.830> when

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
probably because we didn't have it when

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.010 
probably because we didn't have it when
I<00:04:30.950> was<00:04:31.130> testing<00:04:31.490> back<00:04:31.640> in<00:04:31.820> the<00:04:31.910> day<00:04:32.060> I<00:04:32.270> really

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
my last two grade twos - math grades

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.850 
my last two grade twos - math grades
when<00:04:41.000> I<00:04:41.060> do<00:04:41.120> have<00:04:41.360> my<00:04:41.780> dragon<00:04:42.200> as<00:04:42.320> my<00:04:42.440> vanguard

honest I did want to consider three um
but<00:05:12.380> two<00:05:12.800> is<00:05:13.130> very<00:05:13.670> good<00:05:13.940> as<00:05:14.060> it<00:05:14.180> is<00:05:14.270> his<00:05:15.020> Limit

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
but two is very good as it is his Limit

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.230 
but two is very good as it is his Limit
Break<00:05:15.470> is<00:05:15.650> actually<00:05:16.070> stupidly<00:05:16.610> superb

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
Break is actually stupidly superb

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.140 
Break is actually stupidly superb
hitting<00:05:18.200> 22<00:05:19.360> 23<00:05:20.650> 24<00:05:21.650> on<00:05:21.950> they're<00:05:22.490> all<00:05:22.640> really

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
hitting 22 23 24 on they're all really

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.480 
hitting 22 23 24 on they're all really
big<00:05:23.360> numbers<00:05:23.750> and<00:05:23.930> illegible<00:05:24.530> but<00:05:24.800> common<00:05:25.310> and

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
big numbers and illegible but common and

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.060 
big numbers and illegible but common and
a<00:05:25.780> column<00:05:26.780> and<00:05:26.930> then<00:05:27.140> recruit<00:05:27.530> back<00:05:27.770> to<00:05:27.950> your

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
a column and then recruit back to your

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.310 
a column and then recruit back to your
hand<00:05:28.310> for<00:05:28.520> card<00:05:28.700> advantage<00:05:28.850> so<00:05:29.780> you<00:05:30.050> should

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
hand for card advantage so you should

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.950 
hand for card advantage so you should
imagine<00:05:30.530> hitting<00:05:30.830> all<00:05:31.160> of<00:05:31.190> those<00:05:31.460> triggers

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
imagine hitting all of those triggers

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.630 
imagine hitting all of those triggers
with<00:05:32.960> eldona<00:05:33.290> so<00:05:33.620> it's<00:05:33.860> a<00:05:33.950> really<00:05:34.190> dumb<00:05:34.310> card

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:34.640 
with eldona so it's a really dumb card

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.200 
with eldona so it's a really dumb card
I'm<00:05:35.450> also<00:05:35.630> playing<00:05:35.960> to<00:05:36.230> badhak<00:05:36.710> ha<00:05:36.860> ha<00:05:37.610> cause

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
trigger and then I can just sweep away

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.640 
trigger and then I can just sweep away
the<00:05:48.500> column<00:05:49.040> with<00:05:49.790> eldona<00:05:50.630> and<00:05:50.930> then<00:05:51.320> recruit
