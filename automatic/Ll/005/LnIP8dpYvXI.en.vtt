00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:39.870
 to hi that students coming to question 17 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:44.460
 fcc 2012 metrÃ³ the following question the 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:49.519
 value of the expression 0.799 squared 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:57.239
 minus 0.20 the square / two fifths is 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:59.400
 let's the solution let's the solution 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:08.840
 we need to calculate the value of this 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:17.399
 expression wrote version here the 0.799 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:23.869
 to square - 0.201 squared 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:23.869
 all this divided by two fifths 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.670
 first let's solve this part here 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.909
 O 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:37.380
 This part, this part here, you remember. 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.750
 of a property 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.110
 Let's put as an observation a 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.799
 ownership of primary education in 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:52.140
 did you learn that when you 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:59.670
 square - db to square invoice with 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:02:05.250
 Belt unless it multiplies more 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:07.140
 the result there of elementary school 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.209
 if you notice that I have here 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:16.799
 square - b squared where the aedes 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:19.560
 0.799 and then obeyed 0.201 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.400
 square less than one square is less 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.000
 from b 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:38.000
 love well then this can be billed 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 as being 0.799 - 0.1201 which multiplies 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.570
 0,799 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:57.219
 comma 20 all this divided by two 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:03:02.959
 fifths and the inscriptions will let's do 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:14.590
 0.799 - 0.201 if I make this account 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:16.489
 this expression is going to give 0.598 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.049
 green 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:24.260
 this expression here will have a 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:30.859
 so all of this is zero to 5 98 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:34.010
 times one has now / 2,500 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:35.930
 if you will divide by a fraction as 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.379
 is that you do you repeat the expression 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:44.200
 previous change sometimes divided as 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:46.879
 five times inverts the function 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.109
 divided by two that the team already thing 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:58.060
 that multiply by means of means 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:04:06.879
 therefore this expression is equal to 0.59 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:06.879
 eight times five divided by two 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:26.360
 equal to the numerator shall be equal to the 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:36.620
 Luigi ball 9 90/2 and 2.990 / 2 is 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:41.659
 equal to 1.495 in such expression is 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:46.720
 same 1,495 you shorten the alternative 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:50.300
 correct with the alternative cdu of the letter e 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.569
 earned the point in the carlos sores that 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:56.469
 marked an alternative there 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:05:00.369
 that was question number 17 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:05:02.610
 Good luck to you and see you soon 

00:05:00.369 --> 00:05:02.610
 question
