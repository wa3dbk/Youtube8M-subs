00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.800 
the same session due to a busy schedule
I<00:00:26.220> may<00:00:26.490> have<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.820> do<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.060> weights<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.539> cardio

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
I may have to do the weights and cardio

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.169 
I may have to do the weights and cardio
at<00:00:28.140> separate<00:00:28.500> times<00:00:28.680> in<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.039> day<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.460> just

at separate times in the day and just
wondering<00:00:30.390> if<00:00:30.599> this<00:00:30.720> will<00:00:30.869> have<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.019> negative

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
wondering if this will have a negative

wondering if this will have a negative
impact<00:00:31.529> on<00:00:31.920> results<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:33.980> always<00:00:34.980> prefer<00:00:35.430> to

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.020 
split cardio and weights in separate
sessions<00:00:38.960> partly<00:00:39.960> because<00:00:40.370> one<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.700> workout

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
sessions partly because one the workout

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.840 
sessions partly because one the workout
doesn't<00:00:42.360> take<00:00:42.480> as<00:00:42.629> long<00:00:42.660> time<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.640> have

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
doesn't take as long time to you have

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.959 
doesn't take as long time to you have
more<00:00:45.090> energy<00:00:45.300> for<00:00:45.690> each<00:00:45.870> session<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.969> three

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
more energy for each session and three

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.330 
more energy for each session and three
like<00:00:48.329> when<00:00:48.719> i'm<00:00:48.840> done<00:00:49.020> with<00:00:49.110> weights<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:50.010> last

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
like when i'm done with weights the last

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.889 
like when i'm done with weights the last
thing<00:00:50.550> i<00:00:50.640> want<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.850> do<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.000> stay<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.629> do<00:00:51.719> cardio

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
thing i want to do is stay and do cardio

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.439 
thing i want to do is stay and do cardio
afterwards<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.280> like<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.670> start<00:00:53.969> my<00:00:54.059> day<00:00:54.210> out

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
afterwards so I like to start my day out

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.209 
afterwards so I like to start my day out
with<00:00:54.600> cardio<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.260> then<00:00:55.410> when<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.559> have<00:00:55.800> food<00:00:56.039> in

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
with cardio and then when I have food in

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.130 
with cardio and then when I have food in
me<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.879> feel<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.180> little<00:00:57.360> bit<00:00:57.510> more<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.960> little

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
me and I feel a little bit more a little

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.349 
me and I feel a little bit more a little
stronger<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:58.739> have<00:00:59.010> more<00:00:59.160> energy<00:00:59.219> hit<00:01:00.210> the

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
stronger I have more energy hit the

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.200 
stronger I have more energy hit the
weights<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:01.260> either<00:01:01.859> way<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.340> fine<00:01:02.370> but<00:01:03.030> if<00:01:03.120> you

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
weights so either way is fine but if you

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.119 
weights so either way is fine but if you
have<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.480> do<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.780> same<00:01:03.960> session<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.619> your

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
have to do in the same session and your

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.940 
have to do in the same session and your
focus<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:05.820> building<00:01:06.180> some<00:01:06.390> muscle<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:07.020> you

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
focus is on building some muscle and you

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.830 
focus is on building some muscle and you
know<00:01:08.010> increasing<00:01:08.460> your<00:01:08.549> strength<00:01:08.670> do<00:01:09.510> what's

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
know increasing your strength do what's

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.530 
know increasing your strength do what's
required<00:01:10.430> requiring<00:01:11.430> your<00:01:11.850> most<00:01:12.119> energy

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
required requiring your most energy

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.440 
required requiring your most energy
first<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.110> that's<00:01:13.650> usually<00:01:13.860> waits<00:01:14.450> followed

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
first and that's usually waits followed

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.910 
first and that's usually waits followed
by<00:01:15.600> cardio<00:01:17.810> what<00:01:18.810> do<00:01:18.869> i<00:01:18.960> do<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.560> get<00:01:19.710> really
