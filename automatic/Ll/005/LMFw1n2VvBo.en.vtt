00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.630

 know the dressing room that the 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.310
 most people say they are gathering together 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.440
 around the buildings to personality 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.940
 image in that living will undoubtedly 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.960

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.600
 have to ask after that first was not that 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.600
 Unfortunately 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.000
 Hello Hello hello 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.800
 now it is true that marco is demonstrable 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.940
 has thicker muscles like some 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.770
 of the other band members it is that me 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.450
 pumping in very hard demands for that 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.470
 the gym or do you think I know 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.470
 that that is innate 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.690
 mark rose in itself is quite insecure about 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.480
 his figure so thank you guys play 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.560
 patience also rule that i am in it 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.630
 abroad and then you have to 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.430
 of course every they sleep 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.080
 now I can imagine that you will 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.220
 play somewhere where that then in the 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.230
 city â€‹â€‹all hotels 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.150
 I looked archer full that day 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.590
 these burners so that you with all those 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.810
 men must sleep in such a small 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.579
 room and john broken whereupon but 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.230
 a brittle light and then I wonder 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.690
 then you are the one that spoon spoon 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:23.530
 light with marco 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:23.530
 if oh shit says yes thank you 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:30.040
 I thought it's going to be nothing 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:39.180
 but I like it spontaneously 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:39.180
 my last question how is marco ready 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:45.780
 I don't know that you would make yourself 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:48.129
 have to ask but that is not no 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.200
 no no make but you say that 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:51.970
 which is very subdued and mumbling to 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.480
 are frightened by those little punches 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.010
 Then you think he says more 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:10.920
 from the diaphragm to proceed 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:10.920
 not just that tasty anymore 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.870
 is 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.680
 all right 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:48.099
 And something that happens here is very strange 

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:51.189
 janne get applause 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:53.619
 during most and the but indeed arie 

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:57.039
 mole of the green forest would of it 

00:05:53.619 --> 00:06:00.159
 stage but stumbled his 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:03.149
 would then rectally to blast 

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:03.149
 have come
