and why are these important element they
are<00:00:57.230> sun<00:00:58.230> tolerant<00:00:58.800> hence<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.670> name<00:00:59.879> i<00:01:00.210> think

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
are sun tolerant hence the name i think

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.510 
are sun tolerant hence the name i think
i<00:01:00.600> think<00:01:00.660> slugger<00:01:01.079> how<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.469> works<00:01:01.649> it's<00:01:02.399> an

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
i think slugger how that works it's an

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.119 
i think slugger how that works it's an

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
with an eye and what's critical here

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:46.639 
with an eye and what's critical here
magenta<00:01:45.329> is<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.570> first<00:01:45.780> in<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.020> series<00:01:46.229> and

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
magenta is the first in a series and

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.819 
magenta is the first in a series and
it's<00:01:46.979> compact<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.939> thornless<00:01:48.570> two<00:01:49.530> nice

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
it's compact and thornless two nice

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.370 
it's compact and thornless two nice
