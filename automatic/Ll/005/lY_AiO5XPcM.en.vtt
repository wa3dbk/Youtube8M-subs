00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.180
 very good all my name is frames and 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.090
 here we are one more day going to say 4 in 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.760
 this my secondary channel and as you see today 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.370
 touch tell you which is the best weapon or 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.530
 my favorite weapon better in this new 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.119
 battlefield because I really have not 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.029
 unlocked all weapons still not 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.310
 I should give my opinion yet but it is 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.570
 that really is that external I love 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.300
 now I can not say it about another 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.220
 It adapts very well but very well to 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.800
 my style of play the recoil I have already 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.870
 controlled as you see pretty well I know 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.330
 when to shoot blue I know when to do 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.670
 micro bursts yes I know when to do more or 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.370
 less of everything and that is that I love 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.960
 and it really is completely advisable 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.480
 for everyone I'm a newbie 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.010
 if i am able to get into driving 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.170
 this kick I'm sure that 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.740
 very many of you also what 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.410
 you can do there are people out there just as 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.510
 novice that I waiting for me to return 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.120
 well let's say in this game to give 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.160
 advice so it's not that it's good to 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.660
 fact I'm still a good rookie but my 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.670
 first advice for you is that 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.890
 try this gun kids try this 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.640
 gun because 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.979
 the truth is that the drawing I have tried 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.409
 many weapons and no none has gone 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.970
 as well as it is for now 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.490
 Now, as I say, I still need many 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.830
 to unlock but from the hip 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.690
 great to shorten distances goes great to 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.850
 half distances also and without 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.619
 silencer the truth is a pass but 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.170
 I like a newbie that I am need 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.659
 still that invisibility factor for 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.550
 have something more advantage with respect to 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.409
 other rivals for that reason I follow 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.410
 putting the muffler many times 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:41.110
 but as you can see I use it many times 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.509
 to get me all the sights all 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.640
 the silencers and all of everything not 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.250
 because I want to unblock me this weapon 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.050
 the first one I want to get the mastery 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.490
 total what I do not know what it will be called in this 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.460
 game but I want to get it all with 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.810
 this weapon and then it will go to the 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.270
 next not to the next that you touch 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.830
 by the way the kind of doctor as I said 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.380
 the other day I loving it 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.940
 already tried engineer I have tried support and 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.580
 no doubt the truth is that I 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.619
 I would love to have someone behind me 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.470
 throwing ammunition all the time as well 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.140
 that I have made the help packages 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.190
 no and reanimations I would love that 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.220
 there would be a guy from behind scared 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.230
 throwing me ammunition because if I got 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.260
 that already the game would be completely 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.340
 brutal but good kids tell you the 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.230
 game you 're watching in the background now 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.470
 same is good have been two streaks a 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.870
 clip better said and then this streak os 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.970
 collected and I have placed it I have 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.100
 chosen rather because this map is 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.230
 It gives me very, very bad, it seems like a 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.600
 little campero there are too many houses 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.790
 too many corners and I do not like it very much 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.090
 that's why I got this in 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.430
 I liked this game on this map 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.860
 quite for that very reason you like put in 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.329
 this video so a finished game 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.890
 over here I hope you liked the video 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.519
 of course the ex has liked and we 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.519
 we see the next
