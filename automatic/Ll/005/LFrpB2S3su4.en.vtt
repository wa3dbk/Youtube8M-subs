00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.340

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.399
 we are given to see 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.769

 the star of the dome you dare to 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.250
 course let's see the opponent leaves us 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:01.280
 see there is previous team here as in fifth 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.019
 Generation worth we have good has 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.170
 Asuán Persas a month and land 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.179
 always he only switch ariza vale 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.920
 the practically invincible star uses 

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:12.719
 energetic and direct movements are 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.659
 focuses on the attack ok 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:18.030
 well then and now the final fight 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.390
 against tactical you dare let's give it 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.459
 to start worth and we can only 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.990
 use two of three and I believe that here 

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:26.759
 the one that least will do is the poor up 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.860
 sun so let's start by gar de 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.840
 boyle and we're going to take your amper

 why then because with the team of 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.340
 rival I think that the best we can 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:37.140
 do is this so let's go there we take 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.400

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:03.840

 and we are going to throw a psychic 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.760
 stands out more in attack in defense than in 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:17.630
 special defense but this is jet and ximo 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.580
 good earthquake is worth to see that I do not 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.070

 Let's go there 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.700
 to have lowered the special defense 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:39.870
 I should kill him effectively killed him 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.720
 and now come out less 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.700

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:06.150

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.040

 earthquake should not make me too 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.050
 damage since your company holds 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:14.360
