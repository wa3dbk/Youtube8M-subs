okay<00:00:02.610> so<00:00:02.669> this<00:00:03.120> is<00:00:03.389> an<00:00:03.720> acer<00:00:07.280> p23<00:00:08.280> 5h<00:00:09.260> thing<00:00:10.260> is

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
okay so this is an acer p23 5h thing is

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.630 
okay so this is an acer p23 5h thing is
a<00:00:10.559> 20<00:00:11.280> no<00:00:12.240> no<00:00:12.750> 23<00:00:13.639> 20<00:00:14.639> 25<00:00:15.389> inch<00:00:15.660> monitor

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
a 20 no no 23 20 25 inch monitor

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.840 
a 20 no no 23 20 25 inch monitor
computer<00:00:17.640> monitor<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:19.279> it's<00:00:20.279> been

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
computer monitor and it's been

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.880 
computer monitor and it's been
flickering<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.600> lot<00:00:21.779> so<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.170> took<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.650> apart

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
flickering a lot so I took it apart

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.070 
flickering a lot so I took it apart
trying<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.490> see<00:00:23.640> if<00:00:23.699> there<00:00:23.850> was<00:00:23.939> any<00:00:24.119> you<00:00:25.019> know

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
trying to see if there was any you know

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.830 
trying to see if there was any you know
any<00:00:25.109> bad<00:00:25.380> capacitors<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:26.279> such<00:00:26.490> but<00:00:26.910> I<00:00:27.210> can't

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
any bad capacitors and such but I can't

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.479 
any bad capacitors and such but I can't
really<00:00:28.140> find<00:00:28.650> any<00:00:29.010> bad<00:00:29.580> capacitors<00:00:29.880> per<00:00:30.539> se

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
really find any bad capacitors per se

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.010 
really find any bad capacitors per se
but<00:00:32.489> I'm<00:00:32.910> trying<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.270> find<00:00:33.450> out<00:00:33.570> what<00:00:33.840> exactly

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
but I'm trying to find out what exactly

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.490 
but I'm trying to find out what exactly
is<00:00:34.469> making<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:34.950> noise<00:00:35.930> you<00:00:36.930> hear<00:00:37.140> that

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
is making that noise you hear that

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.840 
is making that noise you hear that
buzzing<00:00:37.800> noise<00:00:40.129> just<00:00:41.129> can't<00:00:41.430> quite<00:00:41.610> figure

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
buzzing noise just can't quite figure

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:55.189 
buzzing noise just can't quite figure
out<00:00:42.090> where<00:00:42.329> it's<00:00:42.480> coming<00:00:42.570> from

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.689 

if<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.309> shake<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.670> sometimes<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.390> goes<00:00:57.510> away

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
if I shake it sometimes it goes away

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.029 
if I shake it sometimes it goes away
that<00:00:59.699> can't<00:01:00.239> can't<00:01:01.109> quite<00:01:01.350> tell<00:01:01.620> where<00:01:01.890> it's

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
that can't can't quite tell where it's

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.179 
that can't can't quite tell where it's
coming<00:01:02.159> from<00:01:02.429> actually<00:01:04.070> it's<00:01:05.070> really

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
coming from actually it's really

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.130 
coming from actually it's really
annoying<00:01:05.489> because<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.880> need<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.119> find<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.450> part

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:17.320 

that's<00:01:10.140> called<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.830> depart<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.490> replace<00:01:11.850> it

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:31.550 

so<00:01:18.330> I'm<00:01:18.420> gonna<00:01:18.509> turn<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.869> off<00:01:30.380> the<00:01:31.380> power

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
so I'm gonna turn it off the power

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:40.880 
so I'm gonna turn it off the power
supply<00:01:32.069> here<00:01:32.399> and<00:01:39.020> so<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.200> like<00:01:40.530> an

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
supply here and so this is like an

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:59.529 
supply here and so this is like an
inverter<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.729> think<00:01:55.220> it's<00:01:56.220> like<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.520> relay<00:01:56.909> yeah

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:02.330 

now<00:02:00.539> this<00:02:00.750> one<00:02:00.960> looks<00:02:00.990> okay<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.770> capacitor

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
now this one looks okay this capacitor

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.859 
now this one looks okay this capacitor
right<00:02:02.490> here

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.680 

these<00:02:06.869> aren't<00:02:07.049> bulging<00:02:07.710> or<00:02:07.859> anything

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
these aren't bulging or anything

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.270 
these aren't bulging or anything
neither<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.810> these<00:02:12.829> didn't<00:02:13.829> sound<00:02:13.950> like<00:02:14.130> they

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
neither of these didn't sound like they

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.930 
neither of these didn't sound like they
are<00:02:14.310> anyway<00:02:16.040> but<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.070> just<00:02:17.160> can't<00:02:17.549> quite<00:02:17.760> tell

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
are anyway but I just can't quite tell

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:25.849 
are anyway but I just can't quite tell
what's<00:02:18.209> making<00:02:18.600> that<00:02:18.750> buzzing<00:02:19.170> down<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:24.859> don't

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:25.859 
what's making that buzzing down I don't

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:27.650 
what's making that buzzing down I don't
know<00:02:25.950> if<00:02:26.070> maybe<00:02:26.250> maybe<00:02:26.730> this<00:02:26.970> transistor<00:02:27.450> is

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
know if maybe maybe this transistor is

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.160 
know if maybe maybe this transistor is
making<00:02:28.109> that<00:02:28.230> sound<00:02:28.500> I<00:02:28.799> don't<00:02:28.980> think<00:02:29.220> it<00:02:29.400> would

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
making that sound I don't think it would

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.229 
making that sound I don't think it would
it's<00:02:31.170> just<00:02:31.350> a<00:02:31.440> solid<00:02:31.829> state<00:02:33.380> doesn't<00:02:34.380> burn

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
it's just a solid state doesn't burn

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:43.670 
it's just a solid state doesn't burn
anything<00:02:40.160> so<00:02:41.160> if<00:02:41.549> you<00:02:41.700> guys<00:02:41.880> can<00:02:42.120> sort<00:02:42.600> of<00:02:42.750> give

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
anything so if you guys can sort of give

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.110 
anything so if you guys can sort of give
me<00:02:43.769> some<00:02:43.920> pointers<00:02:44.250> I'm<00:02:44.430> not<00:02:44.609> an<00:02:44.760> electrical

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
me some pointers I'm not an electrical

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.030 
me some pointers I'm not an electrical
engineer<00:02:45.569> at<00:02:45.660> all<00:02:45.780> I'm<00:02:46.260> actually<00:02:46.380> a<00:02:46.680> computer

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
engineer at all I'm actually a computer

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.220 
engineer at all I'm actually a computer
science<00:02:48.799> graduate<00:02:49.799> so<00:02:50.959> don't<00:02:51.959> know<00:02:52.079> much

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
science graduate so don't know much

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.349 
science graduate so don't know much
about<00:02:52.260> hardware<00:02:52.859> but<00:02:53.160> I<00:02:53.400> know<00:02:53.850> I<00:02:53.970> know<00:02:54.090> how<00:02:54.269> to

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
about hardware but I know I know how to

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.059 
about hardware but I know I know how to
take<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.540> I<00:02:54.840> know<00:02:54.989> a<00:02:55.109> bit<00:02:55.440> of<00:02:55.590> how<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:55.799> take<00:02:56.040> it

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
take it I know a bit of how to take it

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.229 
take it I know a bit of how to take it
apart<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:57.290> you<00:02:58.290> know<00:02:58.319> replace<00:02:58.859> solder<00:02:59.459> you

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
apart and you know replace solder you

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.800 
apart and you know replace solder you
know<00:03:00.329> a<00:03:00.359> piece<00:03:00.660> on<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.530> piece<00:03:02.100> off<00:03:02.310> or<00:03:02.690> you<00:03:03.690> know

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
know a piece on a piece off or you know

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.800 
know a piece on a piece off or you know
just<00:03:03.989> hold<00:03:04.409> your<00:03:04.500> pieces<00:03:04.769> on<00:03:05.099> and<00:03:05.250> off<00:03:05.810> that's

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
just hold your pieces on and off that's

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.330 
just hold your pieces on and off that's
quite<00:03:07.019> easy<00:03:07.049> to<00:03:07.319> do<00:03:07.530> just

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
quite easy to do just

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.670 
quite easy to do just
you<00:03:08.400> know<00:03:08.489> get<00:03:08.849> the<00:03:08.970> same<00:03:09.180> item<00:03:10.140> get<00:03:10.379> the<00:03:10.500> same

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
you know get the same item get the same

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.710 
you know get the same item get the same
item<00:03:10.950> that<00:03:11.069> you're<00:03:11.160> replacing<00:03:11.459> and<00:03:11.940> solder<00:03:12.510> it

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
item that you're replacing and solder it

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.110 
item that you're replacing and solder it
on<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:13.590> same<00:03:13.800> or<00:03:13.950> better<00:03:14.069> at<00:03:14.370> least<00:03:16.940> but<00:03:17.940> yeah

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
on the same or better at least but yeah

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.600 
on the same or better at least but yeah
I<00:03:18.150> don't<00:03:18.480> know<00:03:19.260> what<00:03:19.650> could<00:03:19.950> be<00:03:20.069> wrong<00:03:20.220> what's

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
I don't know what could be wrong what's

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.460 
I don't know what could be wrong what's
making<00:03:21.060> that<00:03:21.209> buzzing<00:03:21.420> sound<00:03:21.870> I<00:03:22.200> don't<00:03:22.319> know

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
making that buzzing sound I don't know

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.670 
making that buzzing sound I don't know
if<00:03:22.590> maybe<00:03:22.769> one<00:03:22.950> of<00:03:23.010> these<00:03:23.160> down<00:03:23.700> here<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:24.680> would

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
if maybe one of these down here I would

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.789 
if maybe one of these down here I would
order<00:03:26.519> a<00:03:26.549> messed<00:03:26.849> up<00:03:27.269> but<00:03:29.420> yeah<00:03:30.420> you<00:03:30.540> know<00:03:30.799> so
