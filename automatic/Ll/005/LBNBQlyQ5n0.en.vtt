and<00:00:54.019> yeah<00:00:55.019> Bob's<00:00:55.289> your<00:00:55.499> uncle<00:00:55.530> really<00:00:56.010> that's

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
and yeah Bob's your uncle really that's

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.829 
and yeah Bob's your uncle really that's
a<00:00:56.460> hard<00:00:56.640> one<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.820> play<00:00:57.089> and<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.570> think<00:00:57.719> you're<00:00:57.809> a

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
a hard one to play and I think you're a

00:00:57.839 --> 00:00:59.750 
a hard one to play and I think you're a
lot<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:58.019> fresh<00:00:58.170> legs<00:00:58.379> out<00:00:58.620> there<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:59.070> we're

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
lot of fresh legs out there and we're

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.430 
lot of fresh legs out there and we're
kind<00:00:59.910> of<00:00:59.999> not<00:01:00.120> really<00:01:00.179> sure<00:01:00.510> what<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.809> expect<00:01:00.839> I

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
kind of not really sure what to expect I

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.689 
kind of not really sure what to expect I
think<00:01:02.070> it's<00:01:02.159> gonna<00:01:02.249> be<00:01:02.370> really<00:01:02.460> aggressive

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
think it's gonna be really aggressive

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.759 
think it's gonna be really aggressive
but<00:01:03.600> we've<00:01:03.719> got<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.899> couple<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.199> key<00:01:04.350> guys<00:01:04.559> and

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
but we've got a couple of key guys and

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.350 
but we've got a couple of key guys and
our<00:01:04.830> team<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.280> we<00:01:05.880> were<00:01:05.970> looking<00:01:06.060> for<00:01:06.210> the

that they are in the moves that can the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.880 
that they are in the moves that can the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
tough course kalamunda was used actually

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.290 
tough course kalamunda was used actually
the<00:01:10.980> junior<00:01:11.250> world<00:01:11.370> championships<00:01:11.880> back<00:01:12.120> in

the junior world championships back in

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.630 
the junior world championships back in
1993<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.620> know<00:01:13.860> it's<00:01:14.040> going<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.310> be<00:01:14.370> hilly

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
1993 so you know it's going to be hilly

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.570 
1993 so you know it's going to be hilly
if<00:01:14.910> it<00:01:15.090> was<00:01:15.210> used<00:01:15.450> for<00:01:15.660> world<00:01:15.870> title<00:01:16.260> three<00:01:16.680> two

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
if it was used for world title three two

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.110 
if it was used for world title three two
one<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:19.440> it'd<00:01:19.860> be<00:01:20.070> really<00:01:20.310> difficult<00:01:20.580> for<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.120 
one and it'd be really difficult for the

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.510 
one and it'd be really difficult for the
big<00:01:21.300> team<00:01:21.510> to<00:01:21.690> control<00:01:22.110> because<00:01:22.800> the<00:01:23.190> smaller

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
big team to control because the smaller

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.950 
big team to control because the smaller
