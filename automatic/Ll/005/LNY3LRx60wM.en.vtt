00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120
 Convertible Hello is a day you are there yo is 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:12.750
 Good evening is very slow Today is a game tutorial called Card Commander 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:18.860
 The person who starts the game from now on because I made something 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:23.750
 Ne me over and have slowly those who want to know the rules in order to see the video of the card Commander 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:28.790
 Card Commander is an old flash game, because the number of cards in front is small 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.420
 It is very hot to read each other. There are many cards with tremendous abilities that other card games do not have. 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:36.270
 but 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:39.200
 It is interesting to highest have perfect balance is maintained by the wonderful sense of the author's 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:45.080
 Do we move on to the description of tea Ruru 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:51.079
 This is the play screen. If you use 1 card each turn and set the opponent's life to 0, you win 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:54.350
 You need to pay the level of magic written on the card to use the card 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:59.269
 Magic increases automatically at the beginning of each turn 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:05.480
 Increase this minute magic to the next turn have magic increase the amount written on the cheek 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:08.400
 Increases the amount of magical power increase by 1 from the 5 turn master craftsman, and the magical power increases from the 6th turn 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:14.160
 Do you try to buy far away or Well then 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:17.730
 In this game, basically, you can not fight unless you see the opponent after entering the waiting area 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:24.230
 It becomes easier to read the other's actions 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:29.870
 I'll decide if I'm going to the battlefield next turn and I will pick a card from my hand again 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:33.380
 If the chosen card has a use effect, it will be triggered and it will go to the waiting place 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:36.770
 There are some beekeepers who need consumption magic 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:41.450
 If the magic is insufficient, the usage effect will not trigger 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:44.210
 I can play cards that have a little small frame that is shining like this 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:48.409
 Not congregate use effect is 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:54.590
 If an attacker on hp is out in play, battle will take place 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:02:01.450
 The hp of ATK opponent battle from automatically performed speed is fast attacker in order 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:01.450
 It will be the life of the player who reduced and low hp becomes zero 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:11.810
 The rate went there are three kinds of major數高schools 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.380
 But who, if teachers and ordinary preceding 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.900
 Iue Eeeeee 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:23.790
 If 2 and high school, such one will attack first 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:29.579
 And say what to do if say Well then Vega-gurdy 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:31.730
 Initiative by which those who are Church part to attack earlier randomly determined at the time of competition start 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:31.730
 The 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:43.350
 It will appear on the side that lost the battle of the previous turn after that 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.700
 Phi 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.000
 eh 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.440
 eh 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.670
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.670
 Yu yeah yeah eh 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.000
 Five 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.730
 Hmm 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.730
 Chu Ua Oh 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:18.850
 After the Ya after losing the battle if there are those that are marked with a result defeat effect or victory effect on the card 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:25.000
 I will work with the cutter 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:28.490
 There is also a waiting place effect, so if you leave it in the waiting place you can use the ability many times 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.870
 you do 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:39.340
 Let's go through a bit or I will use a half paper in this situation 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.340
 This will give the attacker the defeat effect of making the opponent's hp zero. 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:51.390
 Initiative to use port One is ahead the way of my First of all because there over here card 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:57.350
 The next time the use effect of the other party is used also the cat has attached high school to the attacker , but originally 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:58.940
 There is no change because of high school, but the battle starts when there is cost-effectiveness 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:04.200
 me 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:08.310
 Since losing here of the attacker to trigger a Nevertheless the victory effect 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:14.280
 After this, this defeat effect will be activated 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:15.180
 As I was able to explain roughly at a place like this, I wonder if you can enjoy the actual battle and the video 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.950
 think 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:25.940
 If you're already okay , please stick to Card Commander 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.940
 I will explain some more detailed rules, but please look at those who are worried 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:35.930
 Deck by explaining the structure of the deck is freely edited using 27 sheets 1 deck of cards 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.930
 I can do it 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:51.400
 However, the same card has 4 colors of card up to 3 in one deck, but any of them is optional 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:56.379
 I can only put up to two colors of 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:57.520
 In this card game, there are not many advantages of combining single colors, so basically two colors are used 

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:59.550
 Crossed deck 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.550
 Hmm 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:07.240
 Well play starts, the Kuruyo pull as the mother road sheet hand was shuffled 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.700
 Hmm 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:19.699
 Good 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:19.699
 However, there are six cards in hand because there is no advantage if there is no initialisation 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:32.020
 -4 cards from the deck at the beginning of each turn 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:37.260
 Please be careful because if you do not have a deck with 0 decks you will lose automatically 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:40.130
 I 'm interested because there is in the deck coming to win aiming at the end of the deck 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.130
 Uu 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:50.520
 The destroyed card will enter the graveyard 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.520
 Good good 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.590
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:59.290
 You can check the contents by clicking the graveyard button 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:09.180
 t 2 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:10.650
 Out also check the time ahead because come heavily involved in strategy ne 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.160
 teame 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.160
 Ie 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:22.830
 Even if it is going to force out the 2nd body by the use effect of the card by the card to the stone-and-the- flowers who entered the battlefield 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.830
 It will be destroyed 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.030
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.169
 Hmm 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.400
 All right 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:34.210
 goo 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:39.789
 I will not receive the way to 3 waiting places in the East 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:42.690
 Because the more they would also be destroyed and so with a holding area Mecha sea urchin care in Apokado 

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:42.690
 I have to 

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:52.520
 Cards returned to the waiting area or hand from the ship will have all their status and abilities restored. 

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:03.819
 Yup 

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:07.889
 God of worship 

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:09.120
 I 

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:12.080
 Day 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.080
 Say EI 

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:26.930
 The strengthened card was put into a weakened card so as not to be returned to the opponent 

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:27.940
 Oh it advantageously game is out of that or back to the 77th birthday 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:32.100
 me 

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:37.460
 The maximum value of hp and attack power is medium 

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:38.569
 Be careful because it is also not know the stock does not increase use paint by more than 

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.790
 I 

00:07:38.569 --> 00:07:42.270
 eh 

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.270
 Bewitching 

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:52.710
 I think that I will be halved to Alcard but I will be given 

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:52.710
 The decimal point of damage received at that time will be cut off 

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:10.550
 Yes the explanation is over 

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:11.870
 If you are interested, watch the play video and not only watch the video, but actually play 

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:15.880
 Try 

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:15.880
 Then let's meet again in the video lower game 

00:08:16.849 --> 00:08:19.389
 Good
