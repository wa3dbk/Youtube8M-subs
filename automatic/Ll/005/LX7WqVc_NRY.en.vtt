down and again literally very very

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.139 
down and again literally very very
similar<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.450> first<00:02:03.659> half<00:02:03.960> goal<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:05.149> its

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
a few of the players on the scoresheet a

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.059 
a few of the players on the scoresheet a
think<00:03:35.419> that's<00:03:35.569> hige<00:03:35.750> wayne<00:03:35.959> or<00:03:36.290> panda<00:03:36.919> that

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:38.890 
think that's hige wayne or panda that
scored<00:03:37.340> that<00:03:37.430> first<00:03:37.669> goal<00:03:37.940> and<00:03:38.389> looking<00:03:38.780> at

scored that first goal and looking at
that<00:03:39.049> that<00:03:39.380> header<00:03:39.620> reminded<00:03:40.040> me<00:03:40.130> of<00:03:40.160> Suarez's

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:40.639 
that that header reminded me of Suarez's

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:42.819 
that that header reminded me of Suarez's
goal<00:03:40.910> i<00:03:40.940> think<00:03:41.299> i'm<00:03:41.900> not<00:03:42.049> even<00:03:42.169> too<00:03:42.470> sure<00:03:42.500> who
