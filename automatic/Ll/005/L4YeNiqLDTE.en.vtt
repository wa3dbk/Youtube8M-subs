00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
yeah we ended up looking the trash one

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.569 
yeah we ended up looking the trash one
time<00:00:50.539> in<00:00:51.440> the<00:00:51.649> whole<00:00:51.800> year<00:00:52.010> that<00:00:52.219> we<00:00:52.309> were<00:00:52.429> open

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
time in the whole year that we were open

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.630 
time in the whole year that we were open
and<00:00:52.940> that<00:00:53.690> was<00:00:53.899> for<00:00:54.319> packaging<00:00:55.069> material<00:00:55.489> that

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
and that was for packaging material that

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.369

a<00:00:59.389> waste<00:00:59.870> stream<00:00:59.989> for<00:01:00.379> it<00:01:00.440> so<00:01:00.649> they<00:01:00.979> can

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
a waste stream for it so they can

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.729 
a waste stream for it so they can
recycle<00:01:01.399> Wow<00:01:02.089> so<00:01:02.539> almost<00:01:03.109> nothing<00:01:03.469> leaves
