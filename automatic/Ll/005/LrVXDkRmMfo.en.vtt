00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
heating so this sugar will melt in this

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.770 
heating so this sugar will melt in this
heat<00:03:15.730> and<00:03:15.970> it<00:03:16.870> will<00:03:17.109> get<00:03:17.549> mixed<00:03:18.549> with<00:03:18.669> the<00:03:18.790> suit

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
heat and it will get mixed with the suit

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.220 
heat and it will get mixed with the suit
everything<00:03:21.650> is<00:03:21.830> mixed<00:03:22.520> together<00:03:22.790> I<00:03:23.270> will<00:03:24.050> take
