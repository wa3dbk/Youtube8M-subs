00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.350
 Recently recently 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:13.530
 It's not news but it's been a while ago 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:17.340
 There is that street fighter 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.470
 I think there are street fighters at present , but something 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.910
 Huge the back is because of the before 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.960
 Should I change the brightness ? 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.590
 Wintering 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.070
 Street fighter 4 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.020
 New year or not 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.000
 super street fighter from ultra street 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:38.130
 It changes like a fighter 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.130
 It's not Street Fighter spouse 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.329
 Super N Ultra 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:48.450
 It's new, so I 'm not sweet at all 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:52.920
 Street Fighter I've been doing it for a long time, as a favorite sound 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:01:00.000
 I am so glad to see the news or the news this time 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:06.210
 It seems that there are 5 new characters to appear just over winter, but 4 out of 5 are 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 Of out of five of character what-kun appeared or not you say different? 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.540
 Is it three people? 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.080
 Lorent 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.140
 I later 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.159
 Poise 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.909

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:23.330
 Let's go back to the fans a 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.509
 And one more strike 3 and other school legs 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.080
 Panman using Elaine 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:31.600
 We 4 people have decided now 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:36.620
 Hey another body Te 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:41.660
 We say that we announce later, but have not been announced yet so far 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:45.840
 And in fact after all, I 'm a thick and lighter and I gradually upgrade the version gradually 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:48.400
 Sagat Hikaru for his character or character 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.680
 Sagat fire dragon 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:56.790
 Even if it only increases, it does not change so much 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:02:01.650
 Then Kke now and in the current 439 people pilaf cute 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.230
 5 people increasingly Once But 44 people by I certainly sound æ¨‚æ ¡ 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.860
 Anu 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.860
 What'm 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:14.440
 In the comments section of the site, add a gloss mode like the new mode, etc. 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:19.330
 I still have comments 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.560
 Tag is better if you turn to 44 characters or tag team team battle or maybe 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.630
 I think there is 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.120
 Hey 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:29.470
 Team up with three or four people once with that King Fighter and Kana Remo 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.700
 Because it is different 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:36.190
 Whether there is also a team game 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.190
 I think this is a soft street fighter kind of system 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.490
 Say 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:46.540
 Today I 'm expecting a little bit of Ultra Street Fighter's new mode 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.540
 It was moving to say grinded 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.650
 If you are Thank you Street Fighter production 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.250
 Hmm 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.270
 Something is wrong 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.910
 Ma is not one o'clock 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:05.390
 A little rest a little 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:07.630
 I 'll take a break from home and take a break If I'm a little languid, I 'll go to bed again and rest from work tomorrow 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.020
 I think 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.020
