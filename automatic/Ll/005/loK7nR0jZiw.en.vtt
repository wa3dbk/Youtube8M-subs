00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.009
 in this city the doctor make architecture intimately 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:13.209
 to try 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:17.560
 percent explains architecture to society that can be seen in another way 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.470
 as well 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.949
 try to establish a dialogue with society 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:23.480
 so they can retransmit us 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.390
 beneficiaries concerns definitely the breeding ground from which 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.509
 we can make art 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.879
 lately inc creates a black sweater that is very effective that the 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:34.800
 architecture and society foundation 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.030
 a foundation that fundamentally integrates people 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.280
 kubica conditions and intelligent 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.700
 interested in architecture but not necessarily architects in fact in 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.760
 his patronage is only five architects of youth 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.740
 and that is an extraordinarily effective instrument to do what 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.740
 that I'm really interested in the one that highlights the transmission 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.350
 the pavilion of spain I always tell 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.580
 that before presenting a week before they entered the contest there was 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.050
 decided not to do it because you did not have any idea that really 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.580
 I am pleased 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.350
 I knew that the flag of Spain would have to become something 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.870
 what does it mean to eliminate these two concepts first I wanted to have in the 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.490
 country that already had therefore of culture that already had even with respect to the 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.530
 Kosovar economy that we were and seeing what and on the other hand the air the 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.030
 need to create intense spaces 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.909
 what silver tides will explain those most important elements or 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.740
 most important moments of reading how to get access the guitarist 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.280
 the metaphor of the forest is used 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.220
 I was also interested in the materials that obviously make this 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.060
 It ends up specifying in the use of materials that 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.520
 they had an environmental commitment some economic materials ones 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.210
 materials capable of provoking and driving expressive values 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.090
 extraordinary but from the love of his modest terracotta disappeared 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.910
 the terracotta 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.630
 material a in this case 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.329
 a pavilion more than an evidence is a place that circulates is a sequence 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:07.720
 of routes are spaces that occur that cause 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.489
 and missionary really coming out to the viewer 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.489
 It is incidents of lights etc 

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:21.089
 the project loves us has to do with a 

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:25.099
 so your staff with personal love with a love that I have for my daughter with 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.099
 a very special very personal intensity with little money 

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:30.709
 with those two things that I stayed 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.989
 3 with a wonderful landscape because obviously it could not be in another 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:34.929
 place 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:38.919
 the team and with a will also a way of living efe 

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:42.509
 the horse is not only 

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:45.909
 it's a sporting event it's a way of life that I like and I'm interested in 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:46.380
 much 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.620
 we have been our own clients the importance of the environment 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.830
 fundamentally in that affected country if your filial feet in foreign countries 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.570
 really bush as it is a way of doing since idealiza walks with 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:59.660
 very hard landscape 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.150
 in the fantastic labor thing ran with the hills effectively preceding 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.700
 intelligible almost Renaissance itself has a lot to do with the landscape 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.950
 of rights or what is more humid the relationship with the country make famous 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.069
 a relation of subordination of the architecture 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.519
 it's a smart relationship 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.239
 and for that reason it is respectful with the landscape but also from the 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.829
 formation of the current and a very clear volumetry of the importance of 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.510
 covered the filming of the cover with a fact 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.419
 substantial architectural 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:34.959
 defined not only let's say the section xxii occupation contest 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.579
 it is very own, they are very abstract principles but they are there in that 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.249
 architecture of the place so important we have used that I am before a veneer 

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:47.539
 wavy aluminum like all over the globe singer mariah and nick are the others 

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:49.189
 three elements 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:50.649
 both parties have expressed
