00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 Well now let's understand how 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.309
 upload your version of server before 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:10.309
 for example, we have a craft bucket 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:10.309
 164 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.960
 r20 here is such a version of us we want 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.270
 download without before what is it there 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.070
 spigot craft kits or records 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.769
 any talk some other 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.099
 once about this if there are questions here we have 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.880
 there is a file that's such a heat which 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:33.180
 usually lies in finished assemblies in the main 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.200
 well in the main folder roughly has 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.390
 jar extension 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.129
 and we, in principle, run it first 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.170
 when we start the server itself 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.489
 maincraft 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.050
 what do you need to do for this for this 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.780
 go in daddy jar 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.170
 here we have it jar folder throw it here 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.180
 I'll just give it a drag and all 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.350
 wait while we download see here 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.570
 percentage and displayed further click 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.440
 right click here 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.170
 rename and select it here is 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.720
 here is the name server jar 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.130
 i.e. just server jar 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.299
 note you must in no way 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.130
 case of not losing this one 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.990
 file extension . jar 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.250
 it should be so 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.159
 do as a video for example 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:26.280
 server jar then go to our panel 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:31.530
 server so 164 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.040
 version so we go to our server screw 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.190
 we have 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.190
 but also 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:50.320
 go ftp files access oh fu-you and we 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.880
 lured means choose here not 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.700
 the version we chose earlier 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.220
 for example, they bucket 64 and choose your 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.040
 the kernel is its own, that is, we downloaded it 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.970
 found everything here to change nothing 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:08.080
 I must click save and restart 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.010
 our favorite server by the way here is this this 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.020
 version can already 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:12.790
 delete by the way to update 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.440
 list of files and directories can be this 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.420
 ikonochku click all the guys now now 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.810
 everything is fine now we run 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.910
 the version that we need now let's 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.460
 let's see how the plugin install the plugin 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.310
 is in daddy plug-ins we go 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.860
 here and throw our plugin for example 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.860
 world edit here just dragging 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.660
 yes and we restart our server of the console 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.140
 it should be now that the plugin we 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.510
 here's all worldedit installed here 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.459
 it is shown we are on everything is fine 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.790
 we can on the server what we want with this here 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:51.340
 these there that our heart desires 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.760
 do wipe on your server wipe card 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.310
 for example yes we stop the server just 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.280
 delete the world word worlds folders without giving 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:07.540
 world and so on leave we are 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:10.450
 pumped over now so easy delete 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:14.800
 folders here are the three folders in front of them 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.480
 it is written world and we start our server 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.640
 pay attention when starting the server 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.620
 there is a generation of the world and it is usually 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.860
 takes much more longer 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.200
 than usual service all guys go down 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.940
 new world we have new new 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.709
 the worlds we have generated are completely 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:34.030
 new world we can do with it what 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.680
 what we want here is such a guide I hope you 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.840

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.070
