month the new t2i is coming out and at
the<00:00:11.700> very<00:00:11.730> least<00:00:12.210> from<00:00:12.990> looking<00:00:13.290> at<00:00:13.349> the

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
the very least from looking at the

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.020 
the very least from looking at the
sample<00:00:13.830> videos<00:00:14.099> it<00:00:14.370> will<00:00:14.429> have<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.790> same

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
sample videos it will have the same

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.109 
sample videos it will have the same
exact<00:00:15.509> video<00:00:15.839> quality<00:00:16.109> as<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.529> 70<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.430> it's

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
exact video quality as a 70 and it's

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.150 
exact video quality as a 70 and it's
going<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.480> be<00:00:18.630> around<00:00:19.230> half<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.560> practice<00:00:20.100> I

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
going to be around half the practice I

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.010 
going to be around half the practice I
think<00:00:20.340> it's<00:00:20.460> going<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.640> be<00:00:20.699> around<00:00:20.970> 7<00:00:21.420> 99<00:00:21.689> from

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
think it's going to be around 7 99 from

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.500 
think it's going to be around 7 99 from
amazon<00:00:22.500> for<00:00:22.740> just<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:23.100> body<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.609> then<00:00:24.390> an

55<00:00:28.880> lens<00:00:29.880> with<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.449> now<00:00:31.230> I'll<00:00:31.619> do<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.859> whole

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
55 lens with is now I'll do a whole

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.100 
55 lens with is now I'll do a whole
nother<00:00:32.340> series<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.910> videos<00:00:33.210> when<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.660> camera

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
nother series of videos when that camera

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.930 
nother series of videos when that camera
comes<00:00:34.320> out<00:00:34.530> but<00:00:35.070> definitely<00:00:35.610> if<00:00:35.760> you're

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
comes out but definitely if you're

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.410 
comes out but definitely if you're
you're<00:00:36.270> on<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.420> tight<00:00:36.719> budget<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:38.120> you<00:00:39.120> needed

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
you're on a tight budget and you needed

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.080 
you're on a tight budget and you needed
a<00:00:39.690> great<00:00:40.649> video<00:00:40.829> camera<00:00:41.370> with<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.640> same<00:00:41.820> size

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
a great video camera with the same size

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.200 
a great video camera with the same size
sensor<00:00:42.390> as<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.719> 70<00:00:43.170> basically<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.160> t2i<00:00:44.610> has

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
sensor as a 70 basically the t2i has

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.959 
sensor as a 70 basically the t2i has
almost<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.840> same<00:00:46.020> sensor<00:00:46.469> as<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.800> 7d<00:00:47.250> it's

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
almost the same sensor as the 7d it's

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.430 
almost the same sensor as the 7d it's
half<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.870> speed<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.320> frames<00:00:49.649> per<00:00:49.860> second

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
half the speed and frames per second

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.930 
half the speed and frames per second
definitely<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.559> 7d<00:00:53.010> will<00:00:53.309> be<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.760> better

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
definitely the 7d will be the better

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.160 
definitely the 7d will be the better
still<00:00:54.329> camera<00:00:54.750> but<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:56.420> t2i<00:00:57.420> will<00:00:57.960> have

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
still camera but the t2i will have

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.680 
still camera but the t2i will have
nearly<00:00:58.800> exactly<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.699> same<00:00:59.910> video<00:01:00.149> quality<00:01:00.329> it

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
nearly exactly the same video quality it

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.529 
nearly exactly the same video quality it
has<00:01:00.840> all<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.199> exact<00:01:01.710> same<00:01:01.949> video<00:01:02.309> modes<00:01:02.640> 1080p

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
has all the exact same video modes 1080p

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.560 
has all the exact same video modes 1080p
and<00:01:03.719> 720p<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.680> another<00:01:05.519> benefit<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.119> records

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
and 720p and another benefit it records

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.440 
and 720p and another benefit it records
on<00:01:06.689> sdhc<00:01:07.650> cards<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.580> definitely<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.210> will<00:01:09.270> even

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
on sdhc cards so definitely it will even

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.620 
on sdhc cards so definitely it will even
cost<00:01:09.810> less<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.320> record<00:01:11.280> one<00:01:11.880> other<00:01:12.030> thing<00:01:12.420> is

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
cost less to record one other thing is

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.660 
cost less to record one other thing is
that<00:01:12.659> i<00:01:13.110> believe<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.799> recording<00:01:14.310> limit<00:01:14.610> is

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
that i believe the recording limit is

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.999 
that i believe the recording limit is
still<00:01:14.880> going<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.210> be<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.479> same<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:16.710> might

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
still going to be the same it might

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.060 
still going to be the same it might
change<00:01:17.340> depending<00:01:17.880> on<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:19.939> SDXC<00:01:20.939> cards

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
change depending on the the SDXC cards

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.890 
change depending on the the SDXC cards
we'll<00:01:23.070> have<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.340> wait<00:01:23.490> until<00:01:23.549> more<00:01:24.360> videos<00:01:24.689> and

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
we'll have to wait until more videos and

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.749 
we'll have to wait until more videos and
more<00:01:24.960> tests<00:01:25.380> come<00:01:25.500> out<00:01:25.650> but<00:01:26.220> i<00:01:26.280> believe<00:01:26.400> it

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
more tests come out but i believe it

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.640 
more tests come out but i believe it
still<00:01:26.939> has<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.150> same<00:01:27.330> 12<00:01:27.900> minute<00:01:28.259> limit<00:01:28.409> in

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
still has the same 12 minute limit in

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.330 
still has the same 12 minute limit in
1080p<00:01:29.579> at<00:01:29.880> 720p<00:01:30.420> mode<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.930> 30<00:01:31.710> minute<00:01:32.040> limit

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
1080p at 720p mode and 30 minute limit

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.499 
1080p at 720p mode and 30 minute limit
in<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:33.180> 480p<00:01:34.170> mode<00:01:34.549> another<00:01:35.549> really<00:01:35.909> exciting

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
in the 480p mode another really exciting

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.190 
in the 480p mode another really exciting
feature<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.470> has<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> 7x<00:01:38.670> zoom

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
feature is that it has a 7x zoom

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.270 
feature is that it has a 7x zoom
amplification<00:01:40.200> mode<00:01:40.680> now<00:01:41.310> with<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.420> 7d<00:01:43.280> you

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
amplification mode now with the 7d you

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.920 
amplification mode now with the 7d you
can<00:01:44.460> see<00:01:44.640> in<00:01:44.790> Live<00:01:45.000> View<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.570> that

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
can see in Live View that that

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.200 
can see in Live View that that
amplification<00:01:46.680> usually<00:01:47.399> use<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.880> for

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
amplification usually use it for

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.730 
amplification usually use it for
focusing<00:01:49.170> but<00:01:50.329> the<00:01:51.329> t2i<00:01:51.960> will<00:01:52.320> actually<00:01:52.619> be

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
focusing but the t2i will actually be

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.679 
focusing but the t2i will actually be
able<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.950> record<00:01:53.369> that<00:01:53.670> mode<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.479> says

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
able to record that mode and it says

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.780 
able to record that mode and it says
right<00:01:54.720> now<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.470> will<00:01:55.860> be<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.070> standard

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
right now that it will be a standard

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.760 
right now that it will be a standard
definition<00:01:57.329> but<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.990> exciting<00:01:58.530> thing<00:01:58.740> about

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
definition but the exciting thing about

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.280 
definition but the exciting thing about
that<00:01:59.280> is<00:01:59.340> it<00:02:00.000> will<00:02:00.090> be<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.240> one-to-one<00:02:00.719> ratio<00:02:00.899> of

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
that is it will be a one-to-one ratio of
