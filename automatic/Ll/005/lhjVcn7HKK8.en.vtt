00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.930
 moin moin here is again totti with 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.550
 another commented after 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.380
 gameplay may have already noticed 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.650
 and right is not a facebook 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.720
 and that is quite simply why that 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.270
 that is because I may be in 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.160
 able to play very well and 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.019
 By the way, even back nonsense too 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.629
 but talk as soon as reasonable 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:36.489
 themes go there what do i say just man 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.330
 try setting you become a 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.739
 the whole game plays that you have something 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.090
 reasonable talks it works 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.260
 just not because you in between 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.510
 just concentrated and 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.549
 That's why I have always been like that 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.620
 on the canale held actually 

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:52.210
 just what live in color occur 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.850
 it's just rubbish and what's playing 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.400
 is about the other is usually too 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.530
 nonsense there is a bit 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.269
 structured talked so that only 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.460
 time to do so and that's why the gameplay 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.290
 what in this commented things 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.110
 looking to see here is actually 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.790
 incidentally there is something with it 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.600
 Just flickers here it is 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.790
 team deathmatch on the map differently and 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.410
 score is still reasonable for today 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.050
 I thought we would just do it 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.480
 two things and I have again 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.010
 to get some pictures of you guys 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.190
 First of all, and then still something 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:30.790
 important what serious so photo number 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:33.220
 One, yes, what should that be? 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.860
 why is he lying that way he really is 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.610
 been shot or is still 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.890
 not dead at all 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.140
 please your guess and with 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.960
 comments I like the photo 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.630
 Every case is really good and I still have it 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.390
 what found and indeed I play yes 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.210
 here utilization brussels blower at the moment 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.800
 and there is more so scary I mean 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.390
 here at gosee 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.630
 it should really be scary 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.659
 because of the ghosts but that 's really 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.610
 I did not think so 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.260
 I mean there are many times he but that 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.810
 Here are really cool with this staircase 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:11.110
 and on top of this bush where the 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.480
 outside wall league is very cool and very 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.710
 horny probably also a subscriber of this 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.820
 photo here 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:21.160
 is because the products out eyes his 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.800
 i was a fsk 18 and so though that 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.670
 game is something grown so has 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.130
 the photographer really liked and 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.530
 as the last photo for today really there 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.440
 why are a bit animal 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.390
 because the two were so exhausted 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.650
 probably a bit of fun land call of 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.450
 Duty known or other such as that 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.610
 the pictures were 40 hope you have 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.800
 you liked as much as me for 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.840
 has more great pictures or in the future 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.460
 so what fast screenshot of 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.220
 make and deliver to me 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:57.130
 best on facebook on the back 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.490
 which links below in the description 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.460
 is 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.650
 But now we come to the 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.650
 more serious thing and indeed one 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.480
 another series of mine and that was yes 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.420
 then for fun, doctor totti 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.940
 called and the whole thing is sitting there 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.950
 small problem yes that is so in one 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.230
 Art from where I probably really 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.930
 Doctor should be lately 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.870
 I always get news where 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.920
 I just can say yes young the 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.500
 to the doctor 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.490
 I can not help you where 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.710
 Maybe he has something 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:33.190
 good I do not know we decided 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:36.460
 always so that these people do this thing 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:39.130
 Nobody else has yet told 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.830
 We always have it with us 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.750
 have carried around and maybe me 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.910
 First of all, because you do not know me 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.220
 that you are all anonymous yes to me 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.620
 have written and maybe it was 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.460
 yes, that's just fine 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.590
 somebody and the case like me then 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.210
 you said damn you to the doctor 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.460
 that's nothing bad 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.380
 no matter what you do, the doctors have that 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.880
 have a duty of silence if you look at yourself 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.900
 not because somebody is not 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.810
 wants to open 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.970
 parents friends or something in the 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.650
 thing maybe so embarrassing is no 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.570
 I will not turn blue from what is here 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.890
 everything has already been written and 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:16.380
 The cows really do some things 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.380
 sure that was really real 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.590
 were you quite good as I said that 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:24.080
 and then the people then just 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.639
 have gone to the doctor yes, I hope 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.009
 that you are everything else to the doctor 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.169
 would you see and in the future if you 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:31.819
 you feel uncomfortable or have something 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.129
 goes to the doctor johannes schweigepflicht 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:37.210
