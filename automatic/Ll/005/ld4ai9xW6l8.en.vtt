my<00:00:59.399> texture<00:01:00.000> hair<00:01:00.239> however<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:01.440> never

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
my texture hair however I never

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.950 
my texture hair however I never
classified<00:01:02.010> myself<00:01:02.820> as<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:02.969> 4c<00:01:03.480> because<00:01:03.809> I'm

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
classified myself as a 4c because I'm

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.840 
classified myself as a 4c because I'm
saying<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.379> have<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> curl<00:01:04.979> pattern<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.489> know<00:01:05.640> I

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
saying I have a curl pattern you know I

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.630 
saying I have a curl pattern you know I
don't<00:01:06.479> have<00:01:06.689> anything<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.680> have<00:01:08.040> coils

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
don't have anything that I have coils

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.630 
don't have anything that I have coils
everywhere<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.020> said<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.470> can't<00:01:10.920> be<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.130> 4c

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
everywhere so I said I can't be a 4c

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.120 
everywhere so I said I can't be a 4c
because<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.090> definition<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.780> 4c<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.560> hair

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
because the definition of a 4c is hair

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.429 
because the definition of a 4c is hair
that<00:01:14.159> has<00:01:14.610> absolutely<00:01:14.880> gone<00:01:15.689> pattern<00:01:16.290> you

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
that has absolutely gone pattern you

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.580 
that has absolutely gone pattern you
know<00:01:16.500> curl<00:01:16.830> pattern<00:01:17.280> just<00:01:17.610> exact<00:01:18.380> forget<00:01:19.380> that

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
know curl pattern just exact forget that

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.230 
know curl pattern just exact forget that
okay<00:01:19.920> because<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.280> look<00:01:20.460> at<00:01:20.549> everybody<00:01:21.150> in

all complicated when they mended maybe
they<00:03:55.370> just<00:03:55.550> need<00:03:55.760> to<00:03:55.850> just<00:03:56.120> forget<00:03:56.510> about<00:03:56.720> it

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
they just need to just forget about it

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.520 
they just need to just forget about it
because<00:03:57.260> everybody<00:03:57.980> on<00:03:58.070> you

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
because everybody on you

but everybody in that community seems to

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.710

redefinition<00:04:03.720> however<00:04:04.260> I<00:04:04.380> think<00:04:04.709> it<00:04:04.830> needs<00:04:05.010> to

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
redefinition however I think it needs to

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.430 
redefinition however I think it needs to
be<00:04:05.220> seen<00:04:05.400> because<00:04:05.610> everybody<00:04:06.300> knows<00:04:06.569> the<00:04:07.200> hair

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
be seen because everybody knows the hair

classification<00:04:08.190> system<00:04:08.610> is<00:04:08.790> in<00:04:09.630> need<00:04:09.660> of<00:04:10.319> a

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
classification system is in need of a

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.730 
classification system is in need of a
amendment<00:04:12.330> it<00:04:12.750> leaves<00:04:12.990> much<00:04:13.319> to<00:04:13.350> be<00:04:13.620> desired

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
amendment it leaves much to be desired

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.819 
amendment it leaves much to be desired
however<00:04:14.700> they<00:04:15.060> need<00:04:15.239> to<00:04:15.420> classify<00:04:15.660> a<00:04:16.019> 4c<00:04:16.560> as<00:04:16.769> I

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
however they need to classify a 4c as I

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.780 
however they need to classify a 4c as I
see<00:04:17.160> you<00:04:17.220> I<00:04:17.459> would<00:04:17.579> say<00:04:18.000> with<00:04:18.389> a<00:04:19.430> smaller<00:04:20.430> than

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
see you I would say with a smaller than

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
see you I would say with a smaller than
a<00:04:21.120> coffee<00:04:21.450> stir<00:04:22.019> straw<00:04:22.650> because<00:04:23.220> most<00:04:23.490> of<00:04:23.639> my

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
a coffee stir straw because most of my

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.110 
a coffee stir straw because most of my
quilts<00:04:24.810> are<00:04:24.990> the<00:04:25.169> size<00:04:25.410> of<00:04:25.440> a<00:04:26.130> coffee<00:04:26.700> you<00:04:26.940> know

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
quilts are the size of a coffee you know

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.990 
quilts are the size of a coffee you know
a<00:04:27.210> coffee<00:04:27.540> strong<00:04:27.930> how<00:04:28.200> small<00:04:28.530> that<00:04:28.590> is<00:04:29.000> so

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
a coffee strong how small that is so

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.659 
a coffee strong how small that is so
they<00:04:30.150> can<00:04:30.180> say<00:04:30.510> a<00:04:30.540> horse<00:04:30.990> pee<00:04:31.320> is<00:04:31.800> a<00:04:31.919> quad<00:04:32.400> or

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
they can say a horse pee is a quad or

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.210 
they can say a horse pee is a quad or
wave<00:04:32.970> that<00:04:33.510> is<00:04:33.690> smaller<00:04:34.140> in<00:04:34.530> diameter<00:04:34.770> than

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
wave that is smaller in diameter than

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.980 
wave that is smaller in diameter than
the<00:04:36.710> diameter<00:04:37.710> of<00:04:38.160> a<00:04:38.400> coffee<00:04:38.640> straw<00:04:39.150> because

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
the diameter of a coffee straw because

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.930 
the diameter of a coffee straw because
that<00:04:40.230> is<00:04:40.410> the<00:04:40.830> majority<00:04:41.100> and<00:04:41.340> I<00:04:41.460> think<00:04:41.669> I'm<00:04:41.790> the

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
that is the majority and I think I'm the

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.020 
that is the majority and I think I'm the
largest<00:04:42.180> you<00:04:43.140> know<00:04:43.260> my<00:04:43.919> 4c<00:04:44.370> you<00:04:44.580> know<00:04:44.730> straight

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
largest you know my 4c you know straight

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.270 
largest you know my 4c you know straight
and<00:04:45.300> I<00:04:45.419> like<00:04:45.660> really<00:04:46.050> small<00:04:46.320> and<00:04:46.919> you<00:04:47.160> know

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
and I like really small and you know

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.210 
and I like really small and you know
bigger<00:04:47.760> in<00:04:47.970> some<00:04:48.150> areas<00:04:48.600> and<00:04:49.080> I<00:04:49.410> have<00:04:49.740> a<00:04:49.770> real

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
bigger in some areas and I have a real

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.370 
bigger in some areas and I have a real
gamete<00:04:50.880> so<00:04:51.120> I<00:04:51.180> can<00:04:51.360> kind<00:04:51.600> of<00:04:51.690> gauge<00:04:51.930> what's

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
gamete so I can kind of gauge what's

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.110 
gamete so I can kind of gauge what's
going<00:04:52.680> on<00:04:52.860> because<00:04:53.100> I<00:04:53.250> have<00:04:53.460> three<00:04:53.910> different

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
going on because I have three different

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.719 
going on because I have three different
textures<00:04:54.690> no<00:04:55.650> I<00:04:55.950> have<00:04:56.220> four<00:04:56.520> different

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
textures no I have four different

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:59.750 
textures no I have four different
textures<00:04:57.450> in<00:04:57.479> my<00:04:57.810> head<00:04:58.080> so<00:04:58.740> I<00:04:58.770> can<00:04:59.190> kind<00:04:59.460> of<00:04:59.580> get

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
textures in my head so I can kind of get

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.550 
textures in my head so I can kind of get
a<00:04:59.820> feel<00:05:00.150> for<00:05:00.180> what's<00:05:00.660> going<00:05:00.930> on<00:05:01.080> even<00:05:01.440> though

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
a feel for what's going on even though

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.930 
a feel for what's going on even though
I'm<00:05:01.740> you<00:05:02.220> know<00:05:02.340> mostly<00:05:02.820> a<00:05:02.970> four-seat<00:05:03.630> so<00:05:04.320> um
