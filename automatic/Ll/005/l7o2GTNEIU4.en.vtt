on them I don't really know why the two
I<00:02:48.269> got<00:02:48.569> to<00:02:48.720> have<00:02:48.870> oval<00:02:49.260> split<00:02:49.470> rings<00:02:49.680> on<00:02:49.829> them

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
I got to have oval split rings on them

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.300 
I got to have oval split rings on them
maybe<00:02:51.239> they're<00:02:51.480> a<00:02:51.620> certain<00:02:52.620> series<00:02:53.069> but<00:02:53.280> I

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
maybe they're a certain series but I

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.970 
maybe they're a certain series but I
haven't<00:02:53.670> figured<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.120> out<00:02:54.440> which<00:02:55.440> ones<00:02:55.769> have

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
haven't figured it out which ones have

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
it and which ones don't so anyway this

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:09.680 
it and which ones don't so anyway this
one<00:02:58.379> is<00:02:58.620> called<00:02:58.950> diamond<00:02:59.670> dust

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
you pick these up is this very

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.180 
you pick these up is this very
pronounced<00:05:18.490> thin<00:05:19.490> on<00:05:19.700> its<00:05:19.940> back<00:05:20.620> very<00:05:21.620> similar

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
pronounced thin on its back very similar

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.220 
pronounced thin on its back very similar
to<00:05:22.520> the<00:05:22.700> cotton<00:05:23.030> cordell<00:05:23.390> super<00:05:23.720> spot<00:05:23.960> or<00:05:24.200> I

to the cotton cordell super spot or I

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.010 
to the cotton cordell super spot or I
should<00:05:24.620> say<00:05:24.860> the<00:05:25.520> cotton<00:05:26.060> cordell<00:05:26.360> super<00:05:26.780> spot

is<00:05:27.230> very<00:05:27.380> similar<00:05:27.860> to<00:05:27.980> these<00:05:28.420> so<00:05:29.420> this<00:05:30.200> is<00:05:30.320> a

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
is very similar to these so this is a

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:35.440 
is very similar to these so this is a
super<00:05:30.620> spot<00:05:32.740> the<00:05:33.740> only<00:05:33.920> difference<00:05:34.330> with<00:05:35.330> the

super spot the only difference with the

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.100 
super spot the only difference with the
super<00:05:35.750> spot<00:05:36.020> is<00:05:36.290> that<00:05:36.590> they<00:05:36.860> don't<00:05:36.980> have<00:05:37.250> that

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
super spot is that they don't have that

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.920 
super spot is that they don't have that
that<00:05:39.110> fin<00:05:39.410> on<00:05:39.560> the<00:05:39.680> back<00:05:40.180> but<00:05:41.180> the<00:05:41.390> super<00:05:41.720> spot

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
that fin on the back but the super spot

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.900 
that fin on the back but the super spot
seemed<00:05:42.260> to<00:05:42.380> do<00:05:42.800> a<00:05:42.830> little<00:05:43.190> bit<00:05:43.280> better<00:05:43.430> job<00:05:43.730> on
