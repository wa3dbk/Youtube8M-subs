we can't see the exact shape of this

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.740 
we can't see the exact shape of this
thing<00:01:18.830> but<00:01:19.830> based<00:01:20.159> on<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.549> texture<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.360> joins

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
thing but based on the texture and joins

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.260 
thing but based on the texture and joins
it<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.830> safe<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.430> say<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:24.060> system

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
it is safe to say that this system

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.820 
it is safe to say that this system
angles<00:01:24.900> other<00:01:25.110> hand

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
angles other hand

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.249 
angles other hand
my<00:01:26.460> guess<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.700> mango<00:01:27.299> used<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.750> have<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> Hulk

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
my guess is mango used to have a Hulk

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.200 
my guess is mango used to have a Hulk
when<00:01:28.500> they<00:01:28.590> was<00:01:28.740> still<00:01:28.890> performing<00:01:29.640> on<00:01:29.850> stage

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
when they was still performing on stage

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.630 
when they was still performing on stage
but<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.229> Hulk<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.680> not<00:01:31.890> safe<00:01:32.159> for<00:01:32.189> kiss

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
but the Hulk is not safe for kiss

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.490 
but the Hulk is not safe for kiss
because<00:01:33.060> they<00:01:33.240> like<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.479> take<00:01:33.750> his<00:01:33.960> part<00:01:34.200> and

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
because they like to take his part and

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.280 
because they like to take his part and
play<00:01:34.799> with<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:36.030> company<00:01:36.509> replace<00:01:37.020> it

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
play with it so the company replace it

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.469 
play with it so the company replace it
with<00:01:37.470> another<00:01:37.500> hand

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
with another hand

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.210 
with another hand
now<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.750> we've<00:01:39.900> proven<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:40.530> hand<00:01:40.920> doesn't

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
now that we've proven this hand doesn't

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.030 
now that we've proven this hand doesn't

first<00:01:44.340> question

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
first question

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.230 
first question
why<00:01:46.020> will<00:01:46.259> Foxy's<00:01:46.680> hand<00:01:47.009> be<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.520> box<00:01:47.880> if

why will Foxy's hand be in this box if

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.810 
why will Foxy's hand be in this box if
we<00:01:48.840> assume<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.409> this<00:01:49.829> box<00:01:50.100> contains<00:01:50.640> the

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
we assume that this box contains the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.210 
we assume that this box contains the
animatronics<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.780> are<00:01:51.930> scrapped<00:01:52.290> then<00:01:53.009> we

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
animatronics that are scrapped then we

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.300 
animatronics that are scrapped then we

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.770 
the company decided they don't want foxy
anymore<00:02:12.750> so<00:02:13.349> that<00:02:13.530> is

anymore so that is

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.110 
anymore so that is
carted<00:02:14.110> it<00:02:14.230> but<00:02:15.069> I<00:02:15.100> think<00:02:15.250> this<00:02:15.580> is<00:02:15.730> unlikely

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
carted it but I think this is unlikely

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.090 
carted it but I think this is unlikely
because<00:02:16.510> fuzzy<00:02:16.959> is<00:02:17.350> such<00:02:17.650> a<00:02:17.680> popular

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
because fuzzy is such a popular

another<00:02:22.030> reason<00:02:22.540> I<00:02:22.660> could<00:02:22.840> come<00:02:22.990> up<00:02:23.020> with<00:02:23.170> is

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
another reason I could come up with is
