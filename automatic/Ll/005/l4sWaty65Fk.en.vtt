00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.929 
it up here and of course I'm not
adjusting<00:01:52.890> I'm<00:01:52.979> just<00:01:53.159> forcing<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.700> right<00:01:53.820> now

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
get into that here in a second let's go

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.320 
get into that here in a second let's go
ahead<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.039> unscrew<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.940> sub

little<00:02:30.990> sort<00:02:31.560> of<00:02:31.620> leather<00:02:31.920> is<00:02:32.130> sort<00:02:32.370> of

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
little sort of leather is sort of

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.250 
little sort of leather is sort of
venting<00:02:32.880> in<00:02:33.000> them<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.210> don't<00:02:33.390> touch<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.080> down

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
venting in them that don't touch it down

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.720 
venting in them that don't touch it down
well<00:02:34.530> so<00:02:34.860> it<00:02:34.950> gives<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.250> opportunity<00:02:35.430> to

be able to take care of that okay so

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.370 
be able to take care of that okay so
here<00:02:38.220> we<00:02:38.340> have<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.940> area<00:02:39.840> that's<00:02:40.080> going<00:02:40.140> to

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
here we have the area that's going to

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.560 
here we have the area that's going to
hold<00:02:40.620> your<00:02:40.950> units<00:02:41.430> I'm<00:02:42.120> going<00:02:42.270> to<00:02:42.330> try<00:02:42.480> and

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
hold your units I'm going to try and

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.150 
hold your units I'm going to try and
punt<00:02:42.900> figure<00:02:43.260> this<00:02:43.410> out<00:02:43.560> looks<00:02:43.830> like<00:02:43.980> there's

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
punt figure this out looks like there's

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.670 
punt figure this out looks like there's
things<00:02:44.910> that<00:02:45.090> slide<00:02:45.390> in<00:02:45.810> here<00:02:45.840> from<00:02:46.530> the

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
things that slide in here from the

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.570 
things that slide in here from the
outside<00:02:47.310> I<00:02:48.470> don't<00:02:49.470> think<00:02:49.530> it<00:02:49.709> pulls<00:02:49.950> apart<00:02:50.130> in

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
outside I don't think it pulls apart in

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.430 
outside I don't think it pulls apart in
any<00:02:50.820> way<00:02:50.970> shape<00:02:51.240> or<00:02:51.420> form<00:02:51.480> just<00:02:51.990> want<00:02:52.170> to<00:02:52.260> make

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
any way shape or form just want to make

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.010 
any way shape or form just want to make
sure<00:02:52.610> like<00:02:53.610> I<00:02:53.640> say<00:02:53.910> I<00:02:53.940> don't<00:02:54.270> read<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.600> manuals

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
sure like I say I don't read the manuals

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.560 
sure like I say I don't read the manuals
on<00:02:55.170> these<00:02:55.380> so<00:02:56.120> I'm<00:02:57.120> going<00:02:57.240> to<00:02:57.270> go<00:02:57.390> ahead<00:02:57.450> and

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
on these so I'm going to go ahead and

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.840 
on these so I'm going to go ahead and
lock<00:02:57.810> this<00:02:58.020> into<00:02:58.320> place<00:02:58.590> so<00:02:59.310> there's<00:02:59.700> your

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
lock this into place so there's your

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.110 
lock this into place so there's your
unit<00:03:00.270> there<00:03:00.480> and<00:03:01.110> I'm<00:03:01.230> imagining<00:03:01.880> that<00:03:02.880> what

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
unit there and I'm imagining that what

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.600 
unit there and I'm imagining that what
happens<00:03:03.600> here<00:03:03.900> is<00:03:04.080> we<00:03:04.830> have<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.070> take<00:03:05.310> these

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
happens here is we have to take these

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:12.199 
happens here is we have to take these
guys<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:07.910> slide<00:03:08.910> them<00:03:09.120> into<00:03:09.450> place<00:03:11.000> so<00:03:12.000> let's

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
guys and slide them into place so let's

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.330 
guys and slide them into place so let's
see<00:03:12.420> if<00:03:12.510> we<00:03:12.630> can't<00:03:12.930> figure<00:03:13.320> out<00:03:13.500> how<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.040> make

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
see if we can't figure out how to make

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.750 
see if we can't figure out how to make
that<00:03:14.400> work<00:03:15.290> so<00:03:16.290> these<00:03:16.380> guys<00:03:16.620> probably<00:03:17.010> slide

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
that work so these guys probably slide

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.740 
that work so these guys probably slide
in<00:03:17.940> here<00:03:17.970> somehow<00:03:18.660> there<00:03:19.560> we<00:03:19.709> are<00:03:19.880> alright<00:03:20.880> so

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
in here somehow there we are alright so

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.500 
in here somehow there we are alright so
these<00:03:21.870> guys<00:03:22.080> slide<00:03:22.470> in<00:03:22.709> and<00:03:23.209> they<00:03:24.209> give<00:03:24.390> you

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
these guys slide in and they give you

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.090 
these guys slide in and they give you
several<00:03:24.780> different<00:03:25.170> versions<00:03:25.200> it<00:03:25.709> looks<00:03:25.890> like

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
several different versions it looks like

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.650 
several different versions it looks like
versions<00:03:26.580> sizes<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:28.100> everything<00:03:29.100> else<00:03:29.660> so

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
versions sizes and everything else so

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.600 
versions sizes and everything else so
there<00:03:31.170> you<00:03:31.290> go<00:03:31.459> so<00:03:32.459> that's<00:03:32.730> some<00:03:33.030> units<00:03:33.989> there

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
there you go so that's some units there

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.750 
there you go so that's some units there
and<00:03:36.230> looks<00:03:37.230> like<00:03:37.410> they<00:03:37.620> definitely<00:03:38.190> do<00:03:38.489> vary

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
and looks like they definitely do vary

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.860 
and looks like they definitely do vary
in<00:03:38.940> size<00:03:39.180> so<00:03:40.080> that<00:03:40.380> your<00:03:41.310> kind<00:03:42.300> of<00:03:42.360> screw

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
in size so that your kind of screw
