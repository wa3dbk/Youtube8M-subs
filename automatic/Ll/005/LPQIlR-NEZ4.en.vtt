00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.220
 hello people get to my new entry 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:08.469
 for the month of march 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.210
 March I have a lot of money for 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:11.740
 books spent so for me it was 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.190
 Really much money I have only five 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.500
 bought books and well I show 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.359
 I'll just give you the first one 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.109
 book is from lisa schroeder or lisa 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:28.630
 schröder no idea this is coming 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:30.970
 from america I think thought it would have 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.829
 i also read i have the four 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:37.989
 I thought that was a good idea 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:41.020
 and yes that's such a poisonous thing to paint like that 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.940
 a verse novel and I totally think so 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.199
 cool and I think so will I. 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.170
 just something like a book tip 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:49.719
 turn 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.350
 I also came across the book through the book 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:55.239
 love lisa from camille because that has 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.199
 some books of the authors presented 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:01.960
 and there I could not resist and 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:05.140
 also had to buy one of them and the 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.820
 are not that expensive could if 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.550
 you are interested in this you can 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.350
 just missing on amazon judge 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.510
 So I do not used the 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.290
 even cheaper so I think so 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:19.390
 have this for four euros 45 euro 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.850
 This book is about getting one 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.690
 Girl's friend through one 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.890
 accident has lost and she is so from 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:32.770
 his spirit is haunted and it is so 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.000
 letting go of a story and it is 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.930
 very nice so it is correct 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.330
 liked 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.110
 I will definitely have more books 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.570
 author 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.680
 the second book I bought 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.810
 So the books are the mine 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.780
 job video know almost synonymous 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.400
 I know all these books 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.420
 have a few days ago synonymous a sub 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.730
 video uploaded 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.170
 about a week ago and since then 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.360
 just a book new to come but well 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.360
 this is in any case are of 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.160
 Paul Ray and as I have in the suff video 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.050
 said I would have to buy it 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.190
 because of this was so on it 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.289
 That's why I picked up my hand 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.720
 because I think it was awesome and that 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:15.569
 would be totally cute is also a 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:20.519
 real book it has in 4 607 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:23.219
 it has beautiful pages yes I think so 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.079
 is also totally beautiful and me 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:26.579
 think the goldman publisher has good 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:30.599
 work done or the 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:33.000
 people who designed the cover 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.189
 A publisher has a good agency 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.950
 commissioned the cover to design 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:39.540
 yes this is always envelope motif finepix 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.829
 munich I think they have too 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.060
 cover from the other book I have here 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.189
 I would still like to be his 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.980
 that's definitely how it is 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:49.829
 an international the internat the 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.799
 is in ireland and i have ireland and 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.579
 yes anyway and that's why I have to 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.000
 take a book 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:58.469
 and yes I am very much looking forward to it and 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.989
 I can not do that before either 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:03.480
 before I saw that in the bookstore 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.180
 my third newcomer is more 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.310
 the souls of jordi meadows, too 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.230
 from goldman verlag and the environment motiv 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.109
 was also from find ick münchen 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:17.699
 made 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:19.500
 yes i totally cool i know the these 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:22.229
 Agency or whatever this company 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.609
 who designed these envelopes 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:25.500
 Anyway on it so I think so 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:28.319
 cover too so nice and that's why 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.989
 I also picked it up and me 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:34.769
 read that at the moment I am here now 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:36.060
 I read the top so I am 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:40.019
 not quite halfway 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:44.519
 and so far I think it's okay 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.780
 something else was I do not know can 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.459
 now not so say so 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.689
 mega good is because I still somehow 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.349
 not so white where she feared 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:52.109
 lead 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:56.790
 So the lead is then I have 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:04:00.180
 selection of caracas or cas new 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.400
 bought and yes I do already 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.579
 I loved it I loved it 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:10.229
 really really cool 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:14.009
 at the moment the bay for money is also 

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:16.310
 taken from it and find some 

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:18.900
 it's really really good, some people find it 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:22.349
 stupid but I found it really right 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:26.310
 good with princesses and so know 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:27.690
 the bachelor and yet I will be the same 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.260
 in connection, I will still the 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.540
 scratches in it 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:34.800
 just turn it off because I like it 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:38.940
 would like to make a review and 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.500
 that was so nice in the book area 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.440
 as she looks so great too 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:47.130
 wonderfully gorgeous and then my last 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:50.520
 The new entry was books, it's city 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:54.870
 of service of cassandra clare the 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:57.240
 fifth part of the city on series and me 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.840
 that since february I think 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.190
 but I was able to get up 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.050
 Do not get through to it now 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:08.370
 Just buy because this book 20 euros 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:10.500
 costs then I thought that's it 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.210
 a favorite series that's yours 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.480
 favorite author and your favorite ones 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.290
 You have to buy this book and 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.660
 then I'm over my shadow 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.840
 jumped and ordered the book and 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.040
 I'm not ready at the moment 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.380
 Well, in any case, I am very happy 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.250
 thereon 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:32.970
 orange is not quite mine 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:34.740
 color but oh oh I was 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.830
 At the barber you see that we are like that 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:41.070
 short I have it those blond strands 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:43.260
 and I'm actually very 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.790
 unhappy with it but it has to be 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.110
 be transitional so if I am 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:50.790
 will eventually be rewarded again 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:53.190
 I definitely want to be proud of that 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:55.280
 my last books access new access 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:06:01.050

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.990

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.470

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.230
 Why 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.550
 and that had to be just now 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.620
 and I like it very much I have 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.690
