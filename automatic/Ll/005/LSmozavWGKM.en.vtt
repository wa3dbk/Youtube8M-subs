00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.179
 for your newspapers that today I introduced you 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:11.990
 the different elements that make up the ration of cows 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.819
 dairy 

00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:17.380
 as you know, the needs of dairy cows are confined to 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.449
 two 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.099
 so the energy 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.050
 and proteins in the first run you introduce the foods that 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.609
 allow 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:27.609
 the door 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.230
 basic food that brings energy 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.190
 corn silage 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.190
 therefore harvested in September corn silage 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.239
 so we find seeds 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.019
 who brings in the area that is the main source 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:44.870
 energy 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.930
 kiss these fats are exploded to allow better digestion in 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.490
 themselves 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.560
 then we find feet 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.130
 make it cellulose 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.340
 mainly 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.490
 so those cellulose will be degraded in the field too in order to give the 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.050
 will sign volatile 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.140
 option also allow to cover the energy needs the animals 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.270
 so as I say in the wake of the subscript the staple foods 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.689
 at the energy level 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.570
 on herd of yves vignon 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.050
 2nd food used to bring energy eia 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.650
 our dairy cows in the union 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.050
 so the beet pulp 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.500
 from solid waste coming from France or the Paris region 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.200
 so the site the plan carries energy 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.850
 these are co-products of sweets so need relatively low costs 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.330
 weak compared to what we are aware that this is why its 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.920
 use 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.380
 his sixth goal 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.690
 lower quantity 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.010
 corn silage 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.620
 a third foods have used their ends to bring energy on 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.210
 go to stone 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.850
 and that wet grain corn 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.300
 so these are corn kernels and harvested% 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.680
 in October 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.070
 a dry matter rate of 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.510
 from 30 to 35% 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.129
 they are then called 6 they have golden islands the mythical 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.799
 plastic cased 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:15.039
 it's my free list helps bring 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:19.219
 a lot of energy why I'm proud 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.180
 your expectations are presented to you the foods yielding energy other 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.479
 Christian opponent you introduce yourself foods 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:31.189
 bringing protein second key point of cows feeding 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:32.629
 dairy 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.159
 so first of all valencia and alfalfa which is a forage concerned an idea 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:39.729
 therefore kept in hermetic silos 

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:42.269
 affable optimize fermentation 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.219
 but for the lowering of ph 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:48.949
 so this lucerne and harvested in the months of April to May so this is the first 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:50.179
 chopped off 

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:53.379
 it allows the scope of proteins as I have said 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:55.409
 as to the hint is a legume 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:57.629
 then the second 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.569
 advantage of these times age 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.439
 and wise wise fiber compound important 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:04.049
 as could be seen in your 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.849
 distinguishes arms 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.969
 alfalfa silage long enough 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:11.009
 so that allow the rumination of dairy cows 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.159
 so to avoid for example the risk of accident 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.139
 second at 10 min bringing protein a herd of cows 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:22.289
 dairy meeting rapeseed oilcake 

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:24.969
 from oil extraction 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:27.059
 therefore rapeseed 

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:28.889
 it helps to bring 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:32.089
 a lot of protein we go to shoot so it is distributed in large 

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.959
 amount 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.629
 so it's a co-product 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.819
 of human nutrition 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.979
 23rd food yielding protein to flocks 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:42.639
 So the nitrogen corrector 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.939
 it consists of 70% rapeseed cake 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:48.129
 the molasses to allow 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:50.699
 the constitution or granules 

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:54.659
 and finally a small percentage of methionine protect 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.430
 we want to emphasize very important in dairy cows 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.839
 breeding 

00:03:58.839 --> 00:04:01.109
 a forage concert failure 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.569
 which is alfalfa hay 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.829
 but who can bring 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.509
 a lot of fiber to ration as you can see 

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:11.139
 we have a forage dd arm long enough 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:13.079
 to seduce 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.509
 so those that allow 

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:17.919
 important appointments 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.159
 so a rise in ph e 

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:21.699
 at the level of real madrid 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:25.539
 so this is the main benefit of alfalfa hay that I can tell the 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:27.719
 rumination alas for them figure 

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:31.580
 second point i'm a little bit less important since it's a 

00:04:31.579 --> 00:04:33.409
 nebula 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:36.409
 there is a significant protein intake of this fund 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.660
 thankfully I finished presenting you the different foods 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.849
 healthy 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:45.009
 concentrated journey 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:47.620
 but making it possible to constitute the ration of the dairy cows 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.340
 I introduced you to her 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.590
 others had produced that comes out 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:52.909
 which enable 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:55.039
 mineral food 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:56.009
 dairy cows 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:56.849
 First 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:04:59.889
 we learn carbonate in the dairy cow ration 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:03.080
 so the one 46 allows 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.999
 db the ph of the same cows 

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:09.099
 under foot dignity and the Chinese cowardly he 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:12.389
 in addition to the bicarbonate the walkers learning 

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:15.860
 from the crotch that helps bring in calcium 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.509
 and a complement 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:20.509
 with the contribution of phosphorus 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.499
 Food 

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:27.770
 that I presented to you everything was mixed to form the ration 

00:05:27.769 --> 00:05:29.789
 basic dairy cows 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:31.469
 you see here 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:34.240
 so that the mixture is homogeneous 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.240
 so this mix allow this ration allows 

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:41.219
 of products yesterday and enjoys the parish 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:42.860
 Zionist clara 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.360
 but once a day in the morning 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.439
 at the time 

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:50.439
 run Europe in turmoil 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.370
 faced with the refusal of certain products 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:59.490
 proof by the act of production 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.490
 whatever it is 

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:12.659
 tara on your machine that is developed from 7 years 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:15.339
 who is in bale 

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:18.339
 so a telescopic loader 

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:21.669
 in the good example 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:24.229
 he is constituted at the table 

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:27.860
 it's sperm to mix all the foods in a homogeneous way 

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:30.699
 as you could see it more clearly 

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:32.839
 this makes it possible to have a ration 

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:34.379
 homogeneous base 

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:36.930
 once the machine run time 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.410
 the market distributed the basic ration thanks got hitched 

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:42.409
 albert water and waste
