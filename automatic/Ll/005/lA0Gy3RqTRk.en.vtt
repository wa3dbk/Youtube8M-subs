00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.519
 in order to learn to play on 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.529
 the piano is necessary for you to be and 

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:12.150
 your desires and 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:17.940
 synthesizer or piano and so for 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:28.670
 start you need to learn the order of sounds before re 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:32.460
 mi fa sol la si to 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.180
 this is how you see a single continuous 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:40.230
 line 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:44.310
 that is, after si goes again to mi and 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.970
 so on let us be now 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:52.370
 pronounce all the sounds in a row if I speak 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:56.579
 what we start from before we finish it 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.430
 if we start at me to and finish 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:10.520
 us 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:15.200
 let's start from to to re mif salt la 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.200
 si up 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:46.829
 and three re mi fa salt la ci d mi mif 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:50.140
 salt la si re mi 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.539
 the faster and the better you remember 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.670
 the order of the sounds of the themes further to you 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:59.909
 it will be easier to play the instrument 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:10.679
 let's continue to train from fa fa 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:10.679
 salt la si re re fa 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:24.590
 from salt to salt si to re mif salt 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.780
 try to recite without looking 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:39.560
 neither on the screen not on your printed 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:49.020
 reference materials here la la si do re 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:03:02.720
 mi fa sol la and finally 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:03:02.720
 from si si to remi fa salt la si 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:09.600
 now we made sounds with you 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:14.510
 up in a row and now let's say 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:19.340
 their down succession is a little harder 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:31.360
 let's start from to down 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:31.360
