and then press the edges up with your
hands<00:03:08.190> instead<00:03:09.190> of<00:03:09.250> rolling<00:03:09.700> it<00:03:09.760> out<00:03:09.910> like<00:03:10.660> I'm

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
hands instead of rolling it out like I'm

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:39.870 
hands instead of rolling it out like I'm
rolling<00:03:11.140> it<00:03:11.230> out<00:03:35.489> that's<00:03:36.489> actually<00:03:38.730> about<00:03:39.730> the

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
rolling it out that's actually about the

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:57.800 
rolling it out that's actually about the
right<00:03:40.030> size<00:03:40.299> maybe<00:03:40.720> a<00:03:40.870> tiny<00:03:41.260> bit<00:03:41.530> bigger

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:05.310 

let's<00:03:58.810> see<00:04:01.110> that's<00:04:02.110> that<00:04:02.260> right<00:04:03.930> go<00:04:04.930> ahead<00:04:05.110> and

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
let's see that's that right go ahead and

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.300 
let's see that's that right go ahead and
push<00:04:05.500> the<00:04:05.650> edges<00:04:05.800> in<00:04:06.070> just<00:04:06.250> a<00:04:06.370> little<00:04:06.670> bit<00:04:06.790> more

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
push the edges in just a little bit more

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.030 
push the edges in just a little bit more
although<00:04:09.310> you<00:04:09.370> can<00:04:09.610> you<00:04:10.120> know<00:04:10.890> makes<00:04:11.890> the

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
although you can you know makes the

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.010 
although you can you know makes the
edges<00:04:12.430> all<00:04:12.580> perfect<00:04:13.030> after<00:04:13.360> you<00:04:13.450> transfer<00:04:13.660> it

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
edges all perfect after you transfer it

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.470 
edges all perfect after you transfer it
also<00:04:14.140> okay<00:04:15.100> I'm<00:04:15.550> going<00:04:15.760> my<00:04:15.880> wrong<00:04:16.090> kind<00:04:16.390> over
