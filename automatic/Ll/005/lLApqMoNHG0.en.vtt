here<00:00:02.310> and<00:00:02.520> welcome<00:00:03.000> to<00:00:03.179> another<00:00:03.330> EXO<00:00:03.810> zombies

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
here and welcome to another EXO zombies

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.960 
here and welcome to another EXO zombies
infection<00:00:04.680> video<00:00:04.920> this<00:00:05.370> time<00:00:05.430> we're<00:00:05.790> gonna<00:00:05.850> be

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
infection video this time we're gonna be

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.360 
infection video this time we're gonna be
looking<00:00:06.270> at<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.810> brand-new<00:00:07.379> magnetronic

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
looking at the brand-new magnetronic

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.640 
looking at the brand-new magnetronic
microwave<00:00:09.150> gun<00:00:09.389> this<00:00:09.570> is<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.870> brand-new<00:00:10.260> a

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
microwave gun this is the brand-new a

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.499 
microwave gun this is the brand-new a
wonder<00:00:11.250> weapon<00:00:11.340> quote-unquote<00:00:12.059> as<00:00:12.240> you<00:00:12.360> could

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
wonder weapon quote-unquote as you could

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.720 
wonder weapon quote-unquote as you could
say<00:00:12.719> in<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.380> new<00:00:13.530> EXO<00:00:13.920> zombies<00:00:13.950> map<00:00:14.400> we<00:00:14.519> get<00:00:14.639> it

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
say in the new EXO zombies map we get it

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.460 
say in the new EXO zombies map we get it
straight<00:00:15.089> out<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.450> weapon<00:00:15.960> box<00:00:16.170> first

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
straight out of the weapon box first

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.380 
straight out of the weapon box first
time<00:00:16.770> around<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.310> this<00:00:17.699> is<00:00:17.850> how<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:18.180> looks

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
time around and this is how it looks

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.480 
time around and this is how it looks
when<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:19.080> get<00:00:19.320> this<00:00:19.500> thing<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.130> called<00:00:20.369> the

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
when you get this thing it is called the

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.519 
when you get this thing it is called the
magnetron<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.689> works<00:00:21.900> kind<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.230> similar

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
magnetron and it works kind of similar

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.130 
magnetron and it works kind of similar
to<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.740> em1<00:00:23.100> quantum<00:00:23.910> where<00:00:24.420> rather<00:00:24.750> than<00:00:24.930> you

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
to the em1 quantum where rather than you

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.230 
to the em1 quantum where rather than you
have<00:00:25.289> ammo<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:25.980> just<00:00:26.250> has<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.699> percentage<00:00:27.090> of

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
have ammo it just has a percentage of

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.790 
have ammo it just has a percentage of
energy<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.930> then<00:00:28.050> when<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.320> energy<00:00:28.470> goes

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
energy and then when that energy goes

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.130 
energy and then when that energy goes
all<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:28.980> way<00:00:29.070> down<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.300> when<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.960> gun

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
all the way down that is when the gun

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.049 
all the way down that is when the gun
runs<00:00:31.410> out<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.619> ammo<00:00:32.009> now<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.279> have<00:00:32.520> these<00:00:32.700> four

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
runs out of ammo now you have these four

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.810 
runs out of ammo now you have these four
boxes<00:00:33.469> underneath<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.739> percentage<00:00:35.340> which

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
boxes underneath the percentage which

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.610 
boxes underneath the percentage which
shows<00:00:36.059> it's<00:00:36.300> over<00:00:36.660> heat<00:00:36.840> capacity<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:37.530> you

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
shows it's over heat capacity so you

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.569 
shows it's over heat capacity so you
want<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.829> make<00:00:37.920> sure<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.190> thing<00:00:38.399> doesn't

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
want to make sure this thing doesn't

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.280 
want to make sure this thing doesn't
overheat<00:00:39.300> now<00:00:39.660> as<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.840> can<00:00:39.960> see<00:00:40.110> at<00:00:40.200> the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
overheat now as you can see at the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.709 
overheat now as you can see at the
moment<00:00:40.440> I've<00:00:40.770> got<00:00:40.829> insta-kill<00:00:41.790> on<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.210> this<00:00:42.600> is

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
moment I've got insta-kill on so this is

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.090 
moment I've got insta-kill on so this is
killing<00:00:43.020> them<00:00:43.170> rather<00:00:43.320> quickly<00:00:43.469> but<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.040> is

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
killing them rather quickly but this is

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.250 
killing them rather quickly but this is
what<00:00:44.340> it's<00:00:44.460> like<00:00:44.520> on<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.629> early<00:00:45.870> rounds<00:00:46.020> and

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
what it's like on the early rounds and

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.670 
what it's like on the early rounds and
this<00:00:46.379> thing<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.800> really<00:00:47.640> really<00:00:48.270> good<00:00:48.680> further

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
this thing is really really good further

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.639 
this thing is really really good further
into<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.070> rounds<00:00:50.370> me<00:00:50.460> like<00:00:50.670> round<00:00:51.140> 12<00:00:52.140> onwards

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
into the rounds me like round 12 onwards

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.680 
into the rounds me like round 12 onwards
this<00:00:53.219> gun<00:00:53.460> will<00:00:53.579> be<00:00:53.610> slightly<00:00:54.000> less<00:00:54.329> effective

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
this gun will be slightly less effective

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.840 
this gun will be slightly less effective
just<00:00:55.170> because<00:00:55.559> somebody's<00:00:56.520> have<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.670> lot<00:00:56.820> more

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
just because somebody's have a lot more

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.090 
just because somebody's have a lot more
health<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.390> takes<00:00:57.570> quite<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.230> long<00:00:58.469> time<00:00:58.800> for

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
health so it takes quite a long time for

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.979 
health so it takes quite a long time for
you<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.309> actually<00:00:59.489> get<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.420> kills<00:01:00.660> with<00:01:00.870> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
you to actually get the kills with the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.869 
you to actually get the kills with the
zombies<00:01:01.320> but<00:01:01.469> what<00:01:01.739> this<00:01:01.890> gun<00:01:02.100> does<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.820> very

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
zombies but what this gun does is very

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.539 
zombies but what this gun does is very
similar<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.840> wave<00:01:04.110> gun<00:01:04.379> from<00:01:04.710> moon<00:01:05.040> but

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
similar to the wave gun from moon but

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.219 
similar to the wave gun from moon but
rather<00:01:05.760> than<00:01:06.000> shoot<00:01:06.240> just<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.510> single<00:01:06.840> shot<00:01:06.900> is

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
rather than shoot just a single shot is

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.080 
rather than shoot just a single shot is
a<00:01:07.260> bit<00:01:07.560> like<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.890> paralyzer<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.880> wave

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
a bit like the paralyzer and the wave

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.510 
a bit like the paralyzer and the wave
gun<00:01:09.390> put<00:01:09.990> into<00:01:10.200> one<00:01:10.380> weapon<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.189> as<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.430> can

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
gun put into one weapon and as you can

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.149 
gun put into one weapon and as you can
see<00:01:11.790> we<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:12.240> burst<00:01:12.810> there<00:01:13.140> at<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.500> zombies

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
see we just burst there at the zombies

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.390 
see we just burst there at the zombies
and<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.909> more<00:01:15.290> longer<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.409> hold<00:01:16.619> down<00:01:17.009> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
and the more longer you hold down the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.880 
and the more longer you hold down the
wave<00:01:17.759> gun<00:01:18.090> waves<00:01:18.390> at<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.810> zombies<00:01:19.140> for<00:01:19.409> the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
wave gun waves at the zombies for the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.980 
wave gun waves at the zombies for the
quicker<00:01:20.640> they'll<00:01:20.790> just<00:01:21.060> completely<00:01:21.450> explode

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
quicker they'll just completely explode

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.590 
quicker they'll just completely explode
and<00:01:22.200> if<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.500> just<00:01:22.680> leave<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.490> zombies<00:01:23.909> just

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
and if you just leave the zombies just

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.630 
and if you just leave the zombies just
firing<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.170> very<00:01:25.350> slowly<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:26.189> will<00:01:26.220> see<00:01:26.460> them

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
firing it very slowly you will see them

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.280 
firing it very slowly you will see them
slowly<00:01:26.939> inflate<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.720> kind<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.960> like<00:01:28.080> have

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
slowly inflate and kind of like have

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.260 
slowly inflate and kind of like have
boils<00:01:28.799> coming<00:01:29.189> all<00:01:29.310> over<00:01:29.549> their<00:01:29.670> skin<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.150> it's

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
boils coming all over their skin so it's

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.300 
boils coming all over their skin so it's
very<00:01:30.659> very<00:01:30.900> interesting<00:01:31.110> now<00:01:31.799> just<00:01:32.040> like<00:01:32.189> any

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
very very interesting now just like any

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.190 
very very interesting now just like any
weapon<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:32.820> EXO<00:01:33.119> zombies<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.630> gun<00:01:33.869> can<00:01:34.079> be

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
weapon in EXO zombies this gun can be

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
upgraded 20 times perhaps even 25 if

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.840

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
Egg but of course this thing is great

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.350 
Egg but of course this thing is great
when<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.220> upgrade<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.610> just<00:01:41.880> cuz<00:01:42.000> it's<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.210> bit

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
when you upgrade it just cuz it's a bit

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.149 
when you upgrade it just cuz it's a bit
more<00:01:42.509> powerful<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.409> gets<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.680> back<00:01:43.890> all

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
more powerful and it gets you back all

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.859 
more powerful and it gets you back all
that<00:01:44.340> precious<00:01:44.670> ammo<00:01:45.149> because<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.630> won't

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
that precious ammo because you won't

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.420 
that precious ammo because you won't
realize<00:01:46.049> but<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:46.560> thing<00:01:46.770> does<00:01:47.009> run<00:01:47.250> down

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
realize but this thing does run down

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.190 
realize but this thing does run down
quite<00:01:47.729> quickly<00:01:47.909> as<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.780> can<00:01:48.899> see<00:01:49.049> the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
quite quickly as you can see the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.810 
quite quickly as you can see the
percentage<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.680> going<00:01:49.860> down<00:01:50.009> very<00:01:50.040> very<00:01:50.369> quick

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
percentage is going down very very quick

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.760 
percentage is going down very very quick
already<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.049> want<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.259> try<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.500> conserve

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
already so you want to try and conserve

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.649 
already so you want to try and conserve
that<00:01:53.040> but<00:01:53.220> this<00:01:53.310> gun<00:01:53.549> is<00:01:53.790> great<00:01:54.119> for<00:01:54.420> doing

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
that but this gun is great for doing

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.719 
that but this gun is great for doing
massive<00:01:55.020> trains<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.130> just<00:01:56.340> want<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.549> take

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
massive trains and you just want to take

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.550 
massive trains and you just want to take
out<00:01:56.880> all<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.180> trains<00:01:57.420> are<00:01:57.570> very<00:01:57.600> very<00:01:57.960> quickly

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
out all the trains are very very quickly

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.380 
out all the trains are very very quickly
we<00:01:58.890> do<00:01:59.009> have<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.340> cell-free<00:01:59.579> cauterizer

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
we do have the cell-free cauterizer

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.719 
we do have the cell-free cauterizer
shotgun<00:02:00.990> from<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.409> previous<00:02:02.070> map<00:02:02.280> but<00:02:02.670> this

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
shotgun from the previous map but this

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.190 
shotgun from the previous map but this
map<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.119> just<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.390> lot<00:02:03.540> more<00:02:03.719> efficient<00:02:04.140> in

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
map is just a lot more efficient in

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.660 
map is just a lot more efficient in
taking<00:02:04.530> out<00:02:04.649> loads<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.070> loads<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.340> zombies

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
taking out loads and loads of zombies

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.520 
taking out loads and loads of zombies
and<00:02:05.850> it's<00:02:06.180> just<00:02:06.329> very<00:02:06.479> very<00:02:06.600> convenient<00:02:07.200> as<00:02:07.469> it

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
and it's just very very convenient as it

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.130 
and it's just very very convenient as it
doesn't<00:02:08.099> ever<00:02:08.429> need<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.700> reload<00:02:09.239> you<00:02:09.750> just<00:02:09.989> have

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
doesn't ever need a reload you just have

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.000 
doesn't ever need a reload you just have
to<00:02:10.229> make<00:02:10.379> sure<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:10.679> gun<00:02:10.890> doesn't<00:02:11.160> over

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
to make sure this gun doesn't over

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.160 
to make sure this gun doesn't over
for<00:02:12.490> gaining<00:02:12.670> points<00:02:13.180> this<00:02:13.330> weapon<00:02:13.720> is<00:02:13.870> pretty

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
for gaining points this weapon is pretty

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.170 
for gaining points this weapon is pretty
efficient<00:02:14.770> and<00:02:14.980> taking<00:02:15.430> out<00:02:15.520> zombies<00:02:15.550> it<00:02:16.060> is

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
efficient and taking out zombies it is

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.090 
efficient and taking out zombies it is
pretty<00:02:16.450> good<00:02:16.720> but<00:02:16.990> later<00:02:17.260> on<00:02:17.380> into<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.710> rounds

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
pretty good but later on into the rounds

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.760 
pretty good but later on into the rounds
it<00:02:18.280> does<00:02:18.700> take<00:02:18.970> quite<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.330> while<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.930> kill<00:02:20.170> so<00:02:20.680> it

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
it does take quite a while to kill so it

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.580 
it does take quite a while to kill so it
may<00:02:20.920> be<00:02:20.980> a<00:02:21.160> bit<00:02:21.580> of<00:02:21.610> a<00:02:22.030> risk<00:02:22.720> or<00:02:22.960> an<00:02:23.080> option<00:02:23.440> for

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
may be a bit of a risk or an option for

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.290 
may be a bit of a risk or an option for
you<00:02:23.740> and<00:02:24.040> if<00:02:24.340> you<00:02:24.490> want<00:02:24.670> something<00:02:24.910> a<00:02:25.090> little

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
you and if you want something a little

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.540 
you and if you want something a little
bit<00:02:25.420> stronger<00:02:25.720> perhaps<00:02:25.960> then<00:02:26.560> maybe<00:02:26.830> this<00:02:27.310> gun

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
bit stronger perhaps then maybe this gun

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.730 
bit stronger perhaps then maybe this gun
isn't<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.090> gun<00:02:28.240> for<00:02:28.450> you<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.690> use<00:02:28.900> in<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.560> high

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
isn't the gun for you to use in the high

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.380 
isn't the gun for you to use in the high
rounds<00:02:30.190> it's<00:02:30.310> great<00:02:30.550> for<00:02:30.700> getting<00:02:30.940> points<00:02:31.270> of

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
rounds it's great for getting points of

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.240 
rounds it's great for getting points of
course<00:02:31.570> but<00:02:32.200> in<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:32.470> high<00:02:32.620> rounds<00:02:32.980> it<00:02:33.070> just

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
course but in the high rounds it just

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.500 
course but in the high rounds it just
won't<00:02:33.370> take<00:02:33.670> out<00:02:33.820> those<00:02:33.970> zombies<00:02:34.240> quick

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
won't take out those zombies quick

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.320 
won't take out those zombies quick
enough<00:02:34.780> but<00:02:35.110> that<00:02:35.290> is<00:02:35.470> a<00:02:35.500> look<00:02:35.920> at<00:02:36.100> the<00:02:36.730> new

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
enough but that is a look at the new

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.780 
enough but that is a look at the new
Wonder<00:02:38.320> weapon<00:02:38.440> in<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:38.920> map<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.310> microwave
