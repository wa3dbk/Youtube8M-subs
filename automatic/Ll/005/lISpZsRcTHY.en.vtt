15,000<00:01:04.530> invested<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.190> aircraft<00:01:05.400> so

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
15,000 invested in this aircraft so

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.160 
15,000 invested in this aircraft so
let's<00:01:06.030> keep<00:01:06.120> our<00:01:06.300> fingers<00:01:06.450> crossed<00:01:06.659> and

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
let's keep our fingers crossed and

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:15.360 
let's keep our fingers crossed and
hopefully<00:01:07.470> it'll<00:01:07.620> fly

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.070 

when<00:01:16.370> the<00:01:16.520> plane<00:01:16.760> took<00:01:17.000> off<00:01:17.180> I<00:01:17.540> immediately

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
when the plane took off I immediately

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:27.219 
when the plane took off I immediately
had<00:01:18.560> to<00:01:18.590> push<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:19.040> nose<00:01:19.160> down

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.440 

the<00:01:27.649> first<00:01:27.890> bank<00:01:28.189> seemed<00:01:28.520> to<00:01:28.640> go<00:01:28.759> okay<00:01:29.119> with

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
the first bank seemed to go okay with

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.240 
the first bank seemed to go okay with
the<00:01:29.509> exception<00:01:30.079> of<00:01:30.229> the<00:01:30.500> plane<00:01:30.710> wanting<00:01:31.130> to

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
the exception of the plane wanting to

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.969 
the exception of the plane wanting to
climb

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.609 

at<00:01:36.549> this<00:01:36.789> point<00:01:37.060> I<00:01:37.329> had<00:01:37.630> lost<00:01:37.840> all<00:01:38.079> airspeed

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
at this point I had lost all airspeed

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:39.899 
at this point I had lost all airspeed
from<00:01:38.829> the<00:01:38.920> tail-heavy<00:01:39.130> plane<00:01:39.610> to<00:01:39.820> the

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
from the tail-heavy plane to the

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.590 
from the tail-heavy plane to the
backflip<00:01:40.360> I<00:01:41.820> immediately<00:01:42.820> chopped<00:01:43.420> the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
backflip I immediately chopped the

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.510 
backflip I immediately chopped the
throttle<00:01:44.020> and<00:01:44.200> hoped<00:01:44.590> for<00:01:44.710> a<00:01:44.950> nice<00:01:45.100> controlled

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
throttle and hoped for a nice controlled

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:53.710 
throttle and hoped for a nice controlled
crash

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.120 

what<00:01:54.720> ended<00:01:54.869> up<00:01:54.960> happening<00:01:55.020> was<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.799> found<00:01:55.979> the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
what ended up happening was I found the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.520 
what ended up happening was I found the
plane<00:01:56.369> was<00:01:56.610> tail-heavy<00:01:57.030> as<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.479> was<00:01:57.720> flying<00:01:58.170> in

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
plane was tail-heavy as it was flying in

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.639 
plane was tail-heavy as it was flying in
the<00:01:59.399> air<00:01:59.729> it's<00:02:00.090> literally<00:02:00.750> spun<00:02:01.140> itself<00:02:01.470> out

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
the air it's literally spun itself out

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:09.559 
the air it's literally spun itself out
and<00:02:01.950> went<00:02:02.340> straight<00:02:02.490> in

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.930

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
as soon as the backend came up from

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.030 
as soon as the backend came up from
underneath<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.780> knew<00:02:13.379> I<00:02:13.410> was<00:02:13.590> a<00:02:13.620> couple<00:02:13.860> that

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
underneath it I knew I was a couple that
