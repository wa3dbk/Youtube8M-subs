so<00:00:01.949> I<00:00:01.979> had<00:00:02.190> a<00:00:02.220> fellow<00:00:02.490> on<00:00:02.730> the<00:00:02.760> lumberjacks

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
so I had a fellow on the lumberjacks

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.140 
so I had a fellow on the lumberjacks
forum<00:00:04.080> asking<00:00:04.470> me<00:00:04.589> about<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:05.100> egg<00:00:05.819> and<00:00:06.089> I

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
forum asking me about the egg and I

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.430 
forum asking me about the egg and I
built<00:00:06.390> a<00:00:06.509> couple<00:00:06.810> years<00:00:07.020> ago<00:00:07.849> so<00:00:08.849> I<00:00:09.540> figured

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
built a couple years ago so I figured

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.180 
built a couple years ago so I figured
I'd<00:00:10.530> make<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.740> video<00:00:11.070> of<00:00:11.099> it<00:00:12.590> the<00:00:13.590> side<00:00:13.799> boards

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
I'd make a video of it the side boards

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.779 
I'd make a video of it the side boards
are<00:00:14.309> just<00:00:14.490> made<00:00:14.670> out<00:00:14.820> of<00:00:14.969> pine<00:00:16.010> and<00:00:17.010> sounds

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
are just made out of pine and sounds

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.500 
are just made out of pine and sounds
like<00:00:17.910> my<00:00:18.029> neighbors<00:00:18.390> testing<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:20.510> vehicle

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
like my neighbors testing is vehicle

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.779 
like my neighbors testing is vehicle
over<00:00:21.750> there<00:00:21.900> but<00:00:22.199> side<00:00:23.130> boards<00:00:23.430> are<00:00:23.550> made<00:00:23.670> out

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
over there but side boards are made out

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.900 
over there but side boards are made out
of<00:00:23.820> pine<00:00:24.619> decking<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.740> made<00:00:25.949> out<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.310> just<00:00:26.640> old

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
of pine decking is made out of just old

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.330 
of pine decking is made out of just old
pallet<00:00:27.330> wood<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:27.840> sanded<00:00:28.289> down<00:00:30.980> it<00:00:31.980> has<00:00:32.309> a

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
pallet wood that I sanded down it has a

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.930 
pallet wood that I sanded down it has a
hum<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.850> job<00:00:33.390> are<00:00:33.630> out<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.899> pipe<00:00:34.969> and<00:00:37.940> steering

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
hum a job are out of pipe and steering

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.319 
hum a job are out of pipe and steering
linkage<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:40.340> I<00:00:41.340> think<00:00:41.820> they<00:00:41.940> call

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
linkage and I think they call

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.740 
linkage and I think they call
Ackman<00:00:43.340> steering<00:00:44.340> you'll<00:00:45.149> have<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.390> look<00:00:45.539> that

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
Ackman steering you'll have to look that

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.740 
Ackman steering you'll have to look that
up<00:00:45.960> I'll<00:00:46.829> post<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.190> link<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.610> in<00:00:48.300> the

Harbor Freight wheels on it you could

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.910 
Harbor Freight wheels on it you could
pick<00:00:54.300> up<00:00:54.420> them<00:00:54.780> up<00:00:54.809> basically<00:00:55.680> pretty<00:00:55.860> much

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
pick up them up basically pretty much

-<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:02.579> put<00:01:02.789> cotter<00:01:03.000> pins<00:01:03.300> on<00:01:03.480> mine

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
- and I put cotter pins on mine

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.920 
- and I put cotter pins on mine
I'd<00:01:05.430> suggest<00:01:05.729> if<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.270> want<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.570> better<00:01:06.750> wagon

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
I'd suggest if you want a better wagon

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.780 
I'd suggest if you want a better wagon
to<00:01:07.850> find<00:01:08.850> better<00:01:09.630> wheels<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.650> both<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.580> mugs

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
to find better wheels and both the mugs

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.899 
to find better wheels and both the mugs
-<00:01:12.119> cotter<00:01:12.540> pin<00:01:12.780> them<00:01:13.520> these<00:01:14.520> ones<00:01:14.790> are<00:01:14.880> a

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
- cotter pin them these ones are a

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.090 
- cotter pin them these ones are a
little<00:01:15.030> Wiggly<00:01:15.450> but<00:01:15.600> they<00:01:15.720> work<00:01:15.869> well

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.770 

they<00:01:20.100> have<00:01:20.520> little<00:01:20.729> bearings<00:01:21.060> inside<00:01:21.420> let's

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
they have little bearings inside let's

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:29.240 
they have little bearings inside let's
flip<00:01:21.960> flip<00:01:22.229> let's<00:01:22.619> flip<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:22.950> thing<00:01:23.009> over<00:01:28.250> so

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
flip flip let's flip this thing over so

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.149 
flip flip let's flip this thing over so
it<00:01:29.579> has<00:01:31.310> four<00:01:32.310> rails<00:01:32.729> going<00:01:33.090> up<00:01:33.950> ones<00:01:34.950> outside

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
it has four rails going up ones outside

it has four rails going up ones outside
the<00:01:35.490> perimeter<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:37.710> ones<00:01:37.890> on<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.159> inside

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
the perimeter and the ones on the inside

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.999 
the perimeter and the ones on the inside
are<00:01:38.850> oriented<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.689> other<00:01:39.810> direction

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
are oriented the other direction

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.179 
are oriented the other direction
a<00:01:41.150> couple<00:01:42.150> basically<00:01:43.020> just<00:01:43.200> built<00:01:43.380> like<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.590> car

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
a couple basically just built like a car

a couple basically just built like a car
trailer<00:01:47.570> there's<00:01:48.570> just<00:01:48.869> bees<00:01:49.200> holding<00:01:49.560> up<00:01:49.680> the

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
trailer there's just bees holding up the

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.609 
trailer there's just bees holding up the
rear<00:01:50.040> axle<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:51.600> just<00:01:51.840> took<00:01:51.990> two<00:01:52.170> bolts<00:01:52.500> and

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
rear axle and I just took two bolts and

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.280 
rear axle and I just took two bolts and
welded<00:01:52.950> them<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> piece<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.610> angle<00:01:53.909> iron<00:01:54.290> for

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
welded them to a piece of angle iron for

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.370 
welded them to a piece of angle iron for
the<00:01:55.320> rear<00:01:56.149> have<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.180> couple<00:01:57.540> spacers<00:01:58.020> on<00:01:58.229> the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
the rear have a couple spacers on the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.480 
the rear have a couple spacers on the
back<00:01:58.880> wheels<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:01.320> front<00:02:01.649> wheels

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
back wheels the front wheels

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.380 
back wheels the front wheels
I<00:02:03.469> made<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.680> spindles<00:02:05.159> myself<00:02:05.579> two<00:02:06.030> bolts

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
I made the spindles myself two bolts

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.480 
I made the spindles myself two bolts
just<00:02:07.129> welded<00:02:08.129> them<00:02:08.310> together<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:09.030> put<00:02:09.470> a

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
just welded them together and put a

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.589 
just welded them together and put a
steering<00:02:12.490> bar<00:02:12.730> on<00:02:12.940> their<00:02:13.180> steering<00:02:15.270> arm<00:02:16.270> on

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
steering bar on their steering arm on

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:23.400 
steering bar on their steering arm on
their<00:02:16.870> and<00:02:19.980> built<00:02:20.980> a<00:02:21.130> drawbar<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.170> front

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
their and built a drawbar to the front

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.309 
their and built a drawbar to the front
axle<00:02:24.180> with<00:02:25.180> just<00:02:25.900> a<00:02:26.489> string<00:02:27.489> linkage<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:29.260> you

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
axle with just a string linkage so you

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.930 
axle with just a string linkage so you
have<00:02:29.560> I<00:02:29.739> guess<00:02:29.890> this<00:02:30.069> would<00:02:30.220> be<00:02:30.250> a<00:02:30.430> drag<00:02:30.700> link

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
have I guess this would be a drag link

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.850 
have I guess this would be a drag link
here<00:02:31.239> and<00:02:31.480> then<00:02:31.540> link<00:02:32.200> between<00:02:32.380> both<00:02:32.739> wheels<00:02:34.860> I

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
here and then link between both wheels I

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.890 
here and then link between both wheels I
had<00:02:36.430> to<00:02:36.520> put<00:02:36.730> an<00:02:36.819> extra<00:02:37.030> nut<00:02:37.300> here<00:02:37.600> because

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
had to put an extra nut here because

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.089 
had to put an extra nut here because
this<00:02:38.019> was<00:02:38.230> getting<00:02:38.380> jammed<00:02:38.709> up<00:02:38.890> on<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:40.420> corner

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
this was getting jammed up on the corner

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.850 
this was getting jammed up on the corner
right<00:02:42.099> there<00:02:43.080> she<00:02:44.080> I<00:02:44.110> think<00:02:44.200> this<00:02:44.470> side<00:02:44.680> was

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
right there she I think this side was

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.850 
right there she I think this side was
getting<00:02:45.100> jammed<00:02:45.340> up<00:02:45.550> so<00:02:46.380> put<00:02:47.380> an<00:02:47.470> extra<00:02:47.709> knot

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
getting jammed up so put an extra knot

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.949
