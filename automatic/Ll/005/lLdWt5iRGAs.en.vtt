00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
you're gonna get that high launch low

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.660 
you're gonna get that high launch low
spin<00:00:35.969> trajectory<00:00:36.860> by<00:00:37.860> really<00:00:38.160> focusing<00:00:38.340> on

the<00:00:38.790> feel<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.300> driver<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:40.230> we<00:00:40.350> went<00:00:40.530> away

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
the feel of this driver and we went away

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.959 
the feel of this driver and we went away
from<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:41.070> lot<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.399> things<00:00:41.610> like<00:00:41.730> the

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
from a lot of the things like the

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.639 
from a lot of the things like the
adjustability<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.840> kind<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.320> they're

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
adjustability that kind of they're

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.680 
adjustability that kind of they're
they're<00:00:43.950> hindrances<00:00:44.550> in<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.820> design<00:00:45.120> process

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
they're hindrances in the design process

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.110 
they're hindrances in the design process
by<00:00:46.230> by<00:00:46.649> keeping<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.190> very<00:00:47.219> traditional<00:00:47.579> very

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
by by keeping it very traditional very

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.080 
by by keeping it very traditional very
clean<00:00:48.450> we<00:00:48.989> were<00:00:49.079> able<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.440> focus<00:00:49.860> on<00:00:50.250> putting

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
clean we were able to focus on putting

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.369 
clean we were able to focus on putting
the<00:00:51.180> weight<00:00:51.329> exactly<00:00:51.780> where<00:00:51.870> we<00:00:51.960> wanted<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.320> to

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
the weight exactly where we wanted it to

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.410 
the weight exactly where we wanted it to
so<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.860> would<00:00:52.980> sound<00:00:53.219> proper<00:00:53.820> sound<00:00:54.090> very

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
so that it would sound proper sound very

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.389 
so that it would sound proper sound very
crisp<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.079> sound<00:00:55.289> like<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.980> hit<00:00:56.129> them<00:00:56.280> all

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
crisp and sound like you hit them all

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.760 
crisp and sound like you hit them all
really<00:00:56.670> hard<00:00:56.879> but<00:00:57.420> still<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.930> very<00:00:57.960> soft

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
really hard but still in a very soft

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.889 
really hard but still in a very soft
almost<00:00:59.039> muted<00:00:59.550> feel<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.600> know<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.809> just

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
almost muted feel so it you know it just

by keeping the strong high vertical MLI
you<00:03:29.010> get<00:03:29.190> very<00:03:29.430> consistent<00:03:30.030> launch

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
you get very consistent launch

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.550 
you get very consistent launch
characteristics<00:03:30.870> regardless<00:03:31.320> of<00:03:31.380> where<00:03:31.500> you

hit<00:03:31.680> it<00:03:31.709> on<00:03:31.829> the<00:03:31.950> face<00:03:32.130> up<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.519> now<00:03:32.670> so<00:03:33.299> one<00:03:33.450> of

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
hit it on the face up and now so one of

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.000 
hit it on the face up and now so one of
the<00:03:33.600> clever<00:03:33.840> things<00:03:34.109> we<00:03:34.260> did<00:03:34.410> to<00:03:34.560> save<00:03:34.739> weight

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
the clever things we did to save weight

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.800 
the clever things we did to save weight
on<00:03:35.190> this<00:03:35.340> is<00:03:35.609> we<00:03:35.790> use<00:03:35.970> a<00:03:36.000> chemical<00:03:36.299> etching

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
on this is we use a chemical etching

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.170 
on this is we use a chemical etching
process<00:03:37.350> well<00:03:37.739> that<00:03:37.859> is<00:03:38.040> it's<00:03:38.310> it's<00:03:38.670> a<00:03:38.880> way<00:03:39.030> of

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
process well that is it's it's a way of

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.210 
process well that is it's it's a way of
dipping<00:03:39.660> the<00:03:39.900> crown<00:03:40.140> into<00:03:40.500> a<00:03:40.709> chemical<00:03:41.040> that

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
dipping the crown into a chemical that

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.270 
dipping the crown into a chemical that
actually<00:03:41.640> fins<00:03:42.299> that<00:03:42.450> our<00:03:42.750> so<00:03:43.049> when<00:03:43.650> we<00:03:43.799> form

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
actually fins that our so when we form

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.280 
actually fins that our so when we form
this<00:03:44.489> head<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:45.000> actually<00:03:45.209> you<00:03:45.510> know<00:03:45.600> could

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
this head and actually you know could

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.680 
this head and actually you know could
make<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.799> crown<00:03:47.130> it<00:03:47.819> actually<00:03:48.269> starts<00:03:48.630> a

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
make the crown it actually starts a

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:49.910 
make the crown it actually starts a
little<00:03:48.870> bit<00:03:48.959> thicker<00:03:49.200> but<00:03:49.500> we<00:03:49.590> want<00:03:49.769> to<00:03:49.859> get

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
little bit thicker but we want to get

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.610 
little bit thicker but we want to get
down<00:03:50.100> to<00:03:50.250> 0.5<00:03:50.730> so<00:03:51.060> by<00:03:51.180> using<00:03:52.019> that<00:03:52.200> chemical

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
down to 0.5 so by using that chemical

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.840 
down to 0.5 so by using that chemical
etching<00:03:52.799> process<00:03:53.160> we're<00:03:53.280> able<00:03:53.370> to<00:03:53.519> thin<00:03:53.760> it

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
etching process we're able to thin it

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.490 
etching process we're able to thin it
out<00:03:53.970> in<00:03:54.269> the<00:03:54.600> central<00:03:54.959> portion<00:03:55.109> where<00:03:55.470> it

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
out in the central portion where it

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.199 
out in the central portion where it
doesn't<00:03:55.709> need<00:03:55.859> to<00:03:55.980> be<00:03:56.069> a<00:03:56.100> structurally<00:03:56.670> rigid

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
doesn't need to be a structurally rigid

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.180 
doesn't need to be a structurally rigid
we<00:03:57.510> can<00:03:57.630> get<00:03:57.720> it<00:03:57.810> down<00:03:57.930> to<00:03:57.959> 0.5<00:03:58.530> millimeters

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
we can get it down to 0.5 millimeters

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.620 
we can get it down to 0.5 millimeters
and<00:03:59.459> that<00:03:59.700> helps<00:03:59.970> lower<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.239> center<00:04:00.600> of

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
and that helps lower the center of

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:01.940 
and that helps lower the center of
gravity<00:04:00.690> and<00:04:01.170> lower<00:04:01.319> the<00:04:01.500> spin<00:04:01.709> and<00:04:01.859> the

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
gravity and lower the spin and the

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:08.860 
gravity and lower the spin and the
performance<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.579> head

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.750 

it's<00:04:09.870> a<00:04:10.019> soft<00:04:10.409> sound<00:04:10.739> at<00:04:11.069> the<00:04:11.129> same<00:04:11.340> time<00:04:11.549> it's

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
it's a soft sound at the same time it's

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.520 
it's a soft sound at the same time it's
kind<00:04:11.970> of<00:04:12.030> got<00:04:12.150> a<00:04:12.180> little<00:04:12.360> piercing<00:04:12.689> quality<00:04:13.319> to

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
kind of got a little piercing quality to

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.129 
kind of got a little piercing quality to
it<00:04:13.650> you<00:04:13.739> know<00:04:13.829> it<00:04:13.950> sounds<00:04:14.310> like<00:04:14.810> it's<00:04:15.810> very
