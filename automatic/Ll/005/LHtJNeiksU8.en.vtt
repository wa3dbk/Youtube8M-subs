00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.450
 as 

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.890
 one 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.710
 one 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.629
 as 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:10.839
 there was 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:12.759
 there was 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:15.759
 to paint contemplate the body we will need 

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.019
 a fresh rollover 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.730
 a short account 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.319
 distilled water 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:31.349
 flaxseed oil pincers pines this tula palette to mix the colors that 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.380
 500 very thin 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.350
 a surface to paint 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.280
 like for example a board 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.260
 and the first thing we must do 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.690
 is to prepare the binder that will be the yash of the kashkari game plus the body 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.690
 and separate we have and the whites of the yolks 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.740
 once we have the yolk and we will accept conculca condemnation to break it for its 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.550
 membrane 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.770
 to be able to separate the faith and that is to throw away the ones that do not serve to prepare the 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.770
 painting 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.280
 and he did, we'll have some paprika 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.480
 we will mix it with a little distilled water helping us with a 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:56.620
 dropper 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.620
 and mix we have to get a paste 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.270
 rondÃ³n 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:26.569
 to this caste we will throw the binder and esteem that the game 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:32.769
 taking a little with the hundred pine itself we will mix with the peak a 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.769
 effective instrument 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.129
 next to the store you have to add a few drops of flaxseed oil 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:52.629
 and mix we have again 

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:56.689
 cyntia we have and the painting ready to use 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:01.249
 which we will do immediately since the weather demands very fast 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.999
 and we will apply it on the board 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:13.849
 although the temple can be applied on parchment paper and enzo opare 

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:25.279
 we should apply it in thin layers it is not advisable that I have a lot of heart since 

00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:28.279
 could detach from the support when drying 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:02.189
 I like it 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:05.189
 to achieve it but now 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:07.219
 to achieve
