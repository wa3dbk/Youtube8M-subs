00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 the boy is called and here I bring you this 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.670
 new and possibly last trailer or 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.319
 be the last piece of news that does not 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.610
 come out of her way we already have the 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.200
 from lezea back to the good corner 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.389
 those of those have the right back 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.219
 to the corner we are to Friday the 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.850
 Caesar on Tuesday is nothing more than 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.939
 four or five days and good for that 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.920
 threshing to appear it stung her buttock and 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.019
 They decided to take a trailer against seeing 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.359
 more so to see so I'll bring you a 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.849
 little different are the characters or 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.900
 you know like a biography of the 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.450
 first four characters that are going to 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.550
 use in dead mode this one comes out the 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.960
 character from the beginning I do not think I think 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.610
 I'm making a mistake if I say it's 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.320
 that same character that you see in that 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.329
 right now I do not remember the name 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.219
 the tremendously the document so 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.289
 he is talking about about them about 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.850
 the gangsters who know each other apparently 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.800
 before bringing vision if it's not that 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.510
 there are four prisoners who simply 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.039
 they met and they 're talking about the 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.660
 When the zombies but there are four 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.129
 mobsters who already knew each other before entering 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.239
 in prison then I was a bit 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.670
 talking about your story is not going to 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.079
 go into a lot of detail about that, not what 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.910
 I'm going to how he's saying I'm not going 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.080
 to leave the train I will not leave the 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.430
 teler in this video but this one what 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.140
 leave to be seen in the description 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.550
 here I will detail certain things about 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.070
 the map the 0 in this video as per 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.750
 example here the tower is coming out in 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.370
 this part of the prison coast I 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.110
 always from the beginning that I saw him in 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.640
 the tower I thought about the towers that we have 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.410
 had in transition of airs 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.690
 possibly it is the containment of lis 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.890
 térek if that interest in this map 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.930
 it's going to be like the previous ones then 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.940
 good just to mission is this 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.950
 I do not think it will continue what we will have in 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.290
 what we have in transit but good 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.060
 dimensional that the other in this part 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.080
 come here the are alive this giant that 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.369
 I had done them earlier that 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.020
 possibly the keep I do not know the 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.280
 prison directory but we see now 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.720
 that has a guards plate so 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.160
 I think that is, people are thinking 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.619
 Good thing it's a simple guard 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.240
 but that is going to be a voice and eye this 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.940
 it happened pretty fast that it's going to 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.830
 come back a little here and apparently if 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.040
 when we have the afterlife mode with 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.149
 we are like this we go like ghosts we can 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.920
 the troubadours will not see in this way 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.840
 as well as a ghost mode like how you 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.280
 I already said it then we can be super 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.320
 fast as well as when we are zombies 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.050
 playing in converted and well then 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.000
 just mention that continuing 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.060
 we have we will see a little bit here 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.410
 later to just in this part 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.480
 that comes now with the blades 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.940
 this trend that the zombie 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.709
 has yellow eyes are micro are 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.360
 we are all yellow that we have seen 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.250
 this art in red eyes or are several 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.810
 meanings controlled by samantha 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.610
 so I do not know if it's a game error 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.470
 I do not know if they are appealing material 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.180
 but good missionaries or something else for 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.709
 here our character goes under the 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.569
 blades apparently if we can pass 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.799
 under the trap to save us and 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.450
 well, really, quite a lot 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.590
 lately until we also pass 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.239
 it affects us but in this case 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.849
 we can save ourselves and we go under 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.200
 of them then combining that show 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.090
 a little about each character joe 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.769
 pantolian the zombies the gondola that the 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.049
 gondola going down be the part of the port 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.840
 Maikel maxi killing here with shrapnel 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.459
 now yes as a whole pro a forde wing and 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.739
 here we have the demonic dog and I 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.390
 game that well because the tomahawk now 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.680
 if it moves to be able to talk a little about this 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.180
 because this most interesting all the 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.519
 have a stomach that's why 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.230
 we found so floating in the middle of the 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.060
 road at any time and what 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.620
 we grab and that is that we can use more 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.940
 forward that when I stop stopping this 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.900
 image are going to see how the enzyme tried 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.750
 the zombies 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.640
 tomasson bounced everywhere and I want 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.459
 tell you about a little theory that 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.900
 I commented on twitter that it is not only 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.010
 take it as something real or do not take me 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.720
 the word as such but simply 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.860
 comment is because I really am 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.630
 thinking that possible 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.940
 well I do not know tell me what do you think 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.860
 when I tell them but well I 'll 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.450
 I present the following week but 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.180
 demoniac that we have already seen obviously 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.560
 in all they know they have left I think that the 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.000
 pillar of orange light on the map that 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.500
 normally if we have a blue pillar we 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.090
 indicator is the box I think you 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.320
 I ask the orange tells us where is 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.360
 the dog appears because he knows that 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.460
 but several places appear and appears 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.350
 when it feeds enough 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.970
 of zombies because he eats them and that's what 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.650
 We have seen enough 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.270
 amount of zombies disappears or is like 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.830
 they get me I'm in black again 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.330
 I'm thinking that maybe 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.130
 orange pillar means that it is not 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.600
 warning the dog to the dog when 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.980
 look like we have to feed it with 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.690
 zombies and once we feed it 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.770
 enough releases us the tomahawk this one 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.780
 is a little theory that I am 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.220
 thinking that I'm inventing I do not know 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.480
 take literally it is 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.010
 like something that came to me and 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.910
 possibly it's like that 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.380
 then once it goes we feed 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.480
 about the work that takes what 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.830
 we can use this to get the 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.470
 drop to kill zombies and possibly 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.640
 we need it for the stec and then 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.049
 I'm thinking that once I 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.340
 let's have if another player wants 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.660
 get it you have to repeat the process 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.730
 to feed another dog when it appears 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.380
 in another place with the orange pillar we 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.960
 is notified dog and good for you 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.200
 with the tomahawk this any game what 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.140
 save 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.000
 if we complete the mission of feeding the 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.040
 dog as I said is one more theory 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.570
 this part as they see the plane here and that 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.620
 supposedly we armed to escape the 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.120
 island we have to build the 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.650
 pieces and we see here are the four 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.060
 characters mounted on the plane there are 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.290
 super caleta that I do not know how they do not 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.880
 I know how the fuck they are being to talk 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.440
 but then it starts up the ramp 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.300
 it goes flying and they missed it 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.230
 let's repeat so that they see it well 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.780
 there the left side fires 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.100
 artificial bursting I think so 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.900
 that was artificial are of interest 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.730
 or the tower as we have 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.440
 had in die rise and in transit that 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.700
 when we complete míster in the towers 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.260
 he has released fireworks from 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.030
 a different way you understand root 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.830
 they went with the dragons and they enter 7 was 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.390
 with the electricity tower and I think 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.920
 that if this map is going to follow the story 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.810
 of what we have done or enlisted of how 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.800
 we move it had in derbis and transit the 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.910
 tower that I mentioned before 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.290
 possibly if we complete the hysteria 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.490
 and release those fireworks from 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.110
 Not really occurred to me how 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.570
 have fireworks by the in 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.250
 the pressure if it is not for that and also that 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.560
 as you know they were saying that is the 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.580
 idea was that if we complete the mission of 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.140
 put together the plane was that we were 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.550
 ending or fulfilling this mission 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.590
 Well, a lot of people thought that 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.480
 if we finished assembling the plane it was 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.980
 when we complete the easter eyck and 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.300
 such way we escaped from the island and good 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.710
 It was the end of the sea with the first map of 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.660
 zombies that would have an end 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.280
 in quotation marks but good if it is yes 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.140
 we are escaping with the plane we are 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.630
 finishing the state I do not see why not 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.220
 we are having the tower 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.260
 complete with bursting favors 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.910
 official or simply missionaries 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.250
 that and really it occurred to me and I 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.420
 I said why not then well then those 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.890
 milestones for this video I hope you have them 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.360
 liked if you liked you can not 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.070
 hit the button says like I like that 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.530
 it comes out below favorites if it has 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.120
 liked too much and subscribe if not 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.890
 are subscribed so nothing just everything 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.890
 enough video until next
