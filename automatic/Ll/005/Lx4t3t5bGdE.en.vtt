00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
has 3g so as you can see here that's

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.299 
has 3g so as you can see here that's
where<00:01:03.480> your<00:01:03.629> your<00:01:04.229> SIM<00:01:04.650> card<00:01:04.860> would<00:01:05.010> fit<00:01:05.189> in

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
where your your SIM card would fit in

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.380 
where your your SIM card would fit in
and<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:06.299> basically<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.720> has<00:01:06.810> gps<00:01:07.049> 3g<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.220> Wi-Fi
