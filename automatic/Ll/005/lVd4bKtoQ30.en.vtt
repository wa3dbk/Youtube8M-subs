I'm going to start off with my crossbow

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
this is what it looks like at the time

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.200 
this is what it looks like at the time
when<00:00:19.410> i<00:00:19.470> made<00:00:19.680> this<00:00:19.859> i<00:00:20.039> had<00:00:20.250> purple<00:00:20.520> duct<00:00:20.939> tape

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
when i made this i had purple duct tape

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.120 
when i made this i had purple duct tape
and<00:00:21.869> i<00:00:22.260> didn't<00:00:22.500> want<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.650> waste<00:00:22.800> my<00:00:22.890> other

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
and i didn't want to waste my other

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.730 
and i didn't want to waste my other
colors<00:00:23.580> so<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:24.119> just<00:00:24.900> had<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.170> eat<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.410> just<00:00:25.439> use

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
colors so I just had to eat I just use

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.150 
colors so I just had to eat I just use
purple<00:00:26.039> this<00:00:27.029> is<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.330> trigger<00:00:27.980> that's<00:00:28.980> how

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
purple this is the trigger that's how

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.099 
purple this is the trigger that's how
you<00:00:29.220> hold<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.880> had<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.210> make<00:00:30.359> an<00:00:30.480> extension

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
you hold it I had to make an extension

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.269 
you hold it I had to make an extension
so<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.380> just<00:00:31.470> kind<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.710> flopped<00:00:31.949> me<00:00:32.130> what

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
so you just kind of flopped me what

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.310 
so you just kind of flopped me what
those<00:00:32.399> are<00:00:32.550> two<00:00:32.700> pencils<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.960> make<00:00:34.170> it

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
those are two pencils I to make it

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.000 
those are two pencils I to make it
extension<00:00:34.800> because<00:00:35.450> this<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.870> would<00:00:37.680> only<00:00:37.710> go

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
extension because this it would only go

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.229 
extension because this it would only go
to<00:00:38.070> there<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.520> wouldn't<00:00:38.760> get<00:00:38.850> much<00:00:38.940> power

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
to there and it wouldn't get much power

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.720 
to there and it wouldn't get much power
so<00:00:39.360> now<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.899> goes<00:00:39.989> back<00:00:40.230> here<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:41.280> gets

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
so now it goes back here and it gets

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.139 
so now it goes back here and it gets
pretty<00:00:41.940> good<00:00:42.180> power<00:00:42.680> okay<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.820> have<00:00:44.969> to

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
pretty good power okay so you have to

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.060 
pretty good power okay so you have to
have<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.390> halt<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:45.870> takes<00:00:46.050> about<00:00:46.140> six<00:00:46.530> pins<00:00:46.829> in

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
have a halt it takes about six pins in

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.100 
have a halt it takes about six pins in
about<00:00:47.219> ten<00:00:48.030> minutes<00:00:48.059> five<00:00:48.629> minutes<00:00:48.660> something

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
about ten minutes five minutes something

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.049 
about ten minutes five minutes something
like<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:50.370> all<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.670> do<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:50.879> just

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
like that and so all you do is just

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.990 
like that and so all you do is just
stick<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.510> skewer<00:00:52.379> or<00:00:53.390> this<00:00:54.390> skewer<00:00:54.840> or<00:00:55.879> one<00:00:56.879> of

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
stick a skewer or this skewer or one of

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.720 
stick a skewer or this skewer or one of
these<00:00:57.149> things<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.440> just<00:00:58.739> shove<00:00:59.129> shove<00:00:59.340> it

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
these things and you just shove shove it

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.750 
these things and you just shove shove it
in<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.469> hollow<00:01:01.469> pin<00:01:01.890> tube<00:01:02.100> now<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.399> has<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.670> be

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
in the hollow pin tube now it has to be

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.579 
in the hollow pin tube now it has to be
hollow<00:01:03.030> or<00:01:03.449> its<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.899> course<00:01:04.260> not<00:01:04.350> going<00:01:04.530> to

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
hollow or its of course not going to

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.789 
hollow or its of course not going to
work<00:01:04.710> but<00:01:05.489> all<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:06.060> do<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:07.229> pull<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.619> back

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
work but all you do is you pull it back

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.760 
work but all you do is you pull it back
sometimes<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.340> gets<00:01:08.400> stuck<00:01:08.580> on<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.030> depth

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
sometimes it gets stuck on the depth

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.640 
sometimes it gets stuck on the depth
exactly<00:01:11.150> so<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.240> just<00:01:12.510> pull<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.110> pull<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.439> back

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
exactly so you just pull it pull it back

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.030 
exactly so you just pull it pull it back
like<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:15.140> and<00:01:16.140> it's<00:01:16.290> game<00:01:16.470> just<00:01:16.619> like<00:01:16.680> today

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
like that and it's game just like today

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.859 
like that and it's game just like today
okay<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.939> just<00:01:17.970> pull<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.360> back<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:23.869> its

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
okay so you just pull it back and its

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.460 
okay so you just pull it back and its
really<00:01:25.740> acting<00:01:26.310> up<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.610> never<00:01:26.820> does<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.470> but

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
really acting up it never does this but

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.380 
really acting up it never does this but
it's<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.860> pretty<00:01:29.189> reliable<00:01:29.820> going<00:01:30.030> all<00:01:30.270> you

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
it's a pretty reliable going all you

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.050 
it's a pretty reliable going all you
pull<00:01:30.960> back<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.439> shoot<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.100> now<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.460> don't<00:01:32.790> know

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
pull back and shoot it now I don't know

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.130 
pull back and shoot it now I don't know
