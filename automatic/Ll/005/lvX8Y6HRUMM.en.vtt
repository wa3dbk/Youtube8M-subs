00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
I'm in the process for enough process to

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.929

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
locs I'm in the budding process so the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.960 
locs I'm in the budding process so the
worst<00:01:26.430> case<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.170> slows<00:01:28.500> my<00:01:28.970> budding

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
worst case is that it slows my budding

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.240 
worst case is that it slows my budding
process<00:01:30.540> down<00:01:30.780> but<00:01:31.439> being<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.770> my<00:01:31.950> hair<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.159> a

process down but being that my hair is a
little<00:01:32.520> bit<00:01:32.610> longer<00:01:32.880> I'm<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.210> little<00:01:33.570> bit<00:01:33.659> ahead

little bit longer I'm a little bit ahead

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.260 
little bit longer I'm a little bit ahead
of<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.079> game<00:01:34.290> because<00:01:34.890> my<00:01:35.549> hair<00:01:35.790> looks<00:01:36.060> like

I'm gonna show you what I do it's really
too<00:02:23.870> easy<00:02:24.110> is<00:02:24.380> it's<00:02:24.830> matter<00:02:25.190> of<00:02:25.280> fact<00:02:25.460> is<00:02:25.580> even

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
too easy is it's matter of fact is even

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.520 
too easy is it's matter of fact is even
easier<00:02:26.120> than<00:02:26.390> doing<00:02:26.780> it<00:02:26.930> on<00:02:27.050> natural<00:02:27.500> hair

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
easier than doing it on natural hair

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.800 
easier than doing it on natural hair
because<00:02:28.490> you<00:02:28.610> have<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:28.910> part<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:29.450> that<00:02:29.570> takes

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
because you have the part and that takes

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.170 
because you have the part and that takes
time<00:02:29.930> and<00:02:30.470> then<00:02:30.560> I<00:02:30.650> gotta<00:02:30.830> go<00:02:31.040> in<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.760> back<00:02:32.000> of

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
time and then I gotta go in the back of

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.370 
time and then I gotta go in the back of
my<00:02:32.300> head<00:02:32.600> and<00:02:33.140> use<00:02:33.800> my<00:02:34.160> mirror<00:02:34.610> you<00:02:35.180> know<00:02:35.380> I'm

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
my head and use my mirror you know I'm

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.750 
my head and use my mirror you know I'm
trying<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:36.710> part<00:02:36.920> with<00:02:37.070> one<00:02:37.220> hand<00:02:37.460> and<00:02:37.640> that

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
trying to part with one hand and that

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.510 
trying to part with one hand and that
takes<00:02:38.000> time<00:02:38.270> so<00:02:38.810> that<00:02:38.960> really<00:02:39.200> cut<00:02:39.410> my<00:02:39.560> time<00:02:39.830> in

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
takes time so that really cut my time in

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.620 
takes time so that really cut my time in
half<00:02:40.910> it<00:02:41.300> really<00:02:41.540> did<00:02:41.780> so<00:02:42.970> all<00:02:43.970> I<00:02:44.000> do<00:02:44.180> is<00:02:44.330> grab

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
time I have not been in the mirror at

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.910 
time I have not been in the mirror at
all<00:02:56.360> not<00:02:56.660> even<00:02:56.690> for<00:02:57.050> this<00:02:57.170> front<00:02:57.470> part<00:02:57.710> don't

all not even for this front part don't
need<00:02:58.130> to<00:02:58.310> because<00:02:59.030> my<00:02:59.360> hair<00:02:59.600> is<00:02:59.630> already

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
is great so I do I just take two pieces

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.360 
is great so I do I just take two pieces
of<00:03:05.570> yarn<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:06.380> way<00:03:06.470> you<00:03:06.530> know<00:03:06.770> how<00:03:06.950> long<00:03:07.160> it's

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
of yarn the way you know how long it's

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.160 
of yarn the way you know how long it's
going<00:03:07.520> to<00:03:07.640> be<00:03:07.790> is<00:03:08.000> if<00:03:08.450> you<00:03:08.570> put<00:03:08.750> it<00:03:08.840> up<00:03:08.990> to<00:03:09.020> your

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
going to be is if you put it up to your

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.560 
going to be is if you put it up to your
roots<00:03:09.560> and<00:03:09.890> you<00:03:10.430> put<00:03:10.640> it<00:03:10.760> down<00:03:11.000> all<00:03:11.360> the<00:03:11.480> way

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
roots and you put it down all the way

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.540 
roots and you put it down all the way
down<00:03:11.600> you<00:03:11.930> can't<00:03:12.170> see<00:03:12.350> how<00:03:12.470> far<00:03:12.740> I<00:03:12.770> am<00:03:12.980> but<00:03:13.459> I'm

down a little bit past my breasts you'll

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.600 
down a little bit past my breasts you'll

know how far your dreads it's going to

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.790 
know how far your dreads it's going to
be<00:03:16.760> depending<00:03:17.570> on<00:03:17.690> when<00:03:17.870> you<00:03:17.959> put<00:03:18.200> it<00:03:18.500> in<00:03:18.590> half

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
be depending on when you put it in half

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.900 
be depending on when you put it in half
and<00:03:19.209> I<00:03:20.209> don't<00:03:20.720> need<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:20.990> cross<00:03:21.290> it<00:03:21.560> I'm<00:03:22.340> sorry<00:03:22.610> I

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
and I don't need to cross it I'm sorry I

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.760 
and I don't need to cross it I'm sorry I
don't<00:03:23.270> need<00:03:23.600> to<00:03:23.720> cross<00:03:23.959> it<00:03:24.200> because<00:03:24.440> I<00:03:24.530> don't

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
don't need to cross it because I don't

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.340 
don't need to cross it because I don't
need<00:03:24.980> to<00:03:25.250> break<00:03:26.090> the<00:03:26.330> hair<00:03:26.570> into<00:03:27.080> it<00:03:27.200> because

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
need to break the hair into it because

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.290 
need to break the hair into it because
the<00:03:27.770> drain<00:03:28.040> is<00:03:28.130> gonna<00:03:28.340> act<00:03:28.550> as<00:03:28.730> its<00:03:28.910> own<00:03:29.090> piece

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
the drain is gonna act as its own piece

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.930 
the drain is gonna act as its own piece
of<00:03:29.330> braid<00:03:29.720> so<00:03:30.530> what<00:03:30.890> I<00:03:30.950> do<00:03:31.010> is<00:03:31.280> just<00:03:31.310> take<00:03:31.520> two

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
of braid so what I do is just take two

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:38.340 
of braid so what I do is just take two
strands<00:03:32.570> put<00:03:32.810> it<00:03:32.900> like<00:03:33.020> this<00:03:36.010> take<00:03:37.010> it<00:03:37.220> over

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
strands put it like this take it over

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.390 
strands put it like this take it over
grab<00:03:39.350> that<00:03:40.480> piece<00:03:41.480> of<00:03:41.750> thread<00:03:42.050> make<00:03:42.950> sure<00:03:43.190> it's

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
grab that piece of thread make sure it's

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:54.570 
grab that piece of thread make sure it's
tight<00:03:44.020> by<00:03:45.020> pulling<00:03:45.530> and<00:03:46.250> I<00:03:48.580> just<00:03:49.580> braid

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.050 

that's<00:03:55.330> it<00:03:55.870> I<00:03:56.130> just<00:03:57.130> braid<00:03:57.400> it<00:03:57.430> I<00:03:57.760> like<00:03:57.940> the

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
that's it I just braid it I like the

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.830 
that's it I just braid it I like the
flip<00:03:58.300> mine<00:03:59.640> just<00:04:00.640> a<00:04:00.700> pin<00:04:00.940> that<00:04:01.120> I<00:04:01.180> like<00:04:01.480> to<00:04:01.630> flip

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
flip mine just a pin that I like to flip

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
flip mine just a pin that I like to flip
mine<00:04:02.050> inside<00:04:02.530> out<00:04:02.800> just<00:04:04.260> so<00:04:05.260> I<00:04:05.290> can<00:04:05.440> get<00:04:05.740> it

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
mine inside out just so I can get it

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.570 
mine inside out just so I can get it
tighter<00:04:06.870> and<00:04:07.870> now<00:04:08.080> this<00:04:08.830> is<00:04:08.980> another<00:04:09.310> way<00:04:09.550> of

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
tighter and now this is another way of

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.960 
tighter and now this is another way of
me<00:04:10.060> seeing<00:04:10.620> what<00:04:11.620> my<00:04:11.950> hair<00:04:12.190> will<00:04:12.370> look<00:04:12.400> like<00:04:12.760> at

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
me seeing what my hair will look like at

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.880 
me seeing what my hair will look like at
when<00:04:13.240> it<00:04:13.360> progresses<00:04:14.080> and<00:04:14.230> when<00:04:14.380> it<00:04:14.470> gets<00:04:14.590> long

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
when it progresses and when it gets long

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.920 
when it progresses and when it gets long
because<00:04:15.190> I<00:04:15.460> couldn't<00:04:16.030> I<00:04:16.239> couldn't<00:04:16.299> see<00:04:16.720> my

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
because I couldn't I couldn't see my

because I couldn't I couldn't see my
grid<00:04:17.230> but<00:04:18.070> being<00:04:18.340> that<00:04:18.580> it<00:04:18.670> was<00:04:18.700> short<00:04:19.000> it

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
grid but being that it was short it

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.699 
grid but being that it was short it
always<00:04:19.299> flops<00:04:19.750> back<00:04:20.019> over<00:04:20.350> and<00:04:20.440> I<00:04:20.470> couldn't

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
always flops back over and I couldn't

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.920 
always flops back over and I couldn't
really<00:04:20.860> see<00:04:21.160> so<00:04:21.400> I'll<00:04:21.910> be<00:04:22.120> able<00:04:22.210> to<00:04:22.360> see<00:04:22.570> how<00:04:22.750> my

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.430 
are going to look when it when it
progresses<00:04:35.890> but<00:04:36.460> if<00:04:37.330> you<00:04:37.450> have<00:04:37.630> not<00:04:37.870> seen<00:04:38.140> my

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
progresses but if you have not seen my

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.040 
progresses but if you have not seen my
yarn<00:04:38.770> braids<00:04:39.130> or<00:04:39.340> loose<00:04:39.640> hair<00:04:40.000> I'll<00:04:40.600> post<00:04:40.930> that

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
yarn braids or loose hair I'll post that

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.500 
yarn braids or loose hair I'll post that
video<00:04:41.290> on<00:04:41.560> the<00:04:41.680> description<00:04:41.860> box<00:04:42.460> so<00:04:42.850> you<00:04:43.270> can

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
video on the description box so you can

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.060 
video on the description box so you can
see<00:04:43.660> how<00:04:43.810> to<00:04:43.870> do<00:04:44.080> that<00:04:44.290> but<00:04:44.590> it's<00:04:44.710> pretty<00:04:44.950> much

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
see how to do that but it's pretty much

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.700 
see how to do that but it's pretty much
the<00:04:45.280> same<00:04:45.520> thing<00:04:46.080> what<00:04:47.080> you<00:04:47.200> do<00:04:47.320> is<00:04:47.440> when<00:04:47.590> you

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
the same thing what you do is when you

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.860 
the same thing what you do is when you
get<00:04:47.830> towards<00:04:48.100> the<00:04:48.340> end<00:04:48.430> and<00:04:48.940> you<00:04:49.420> have<00:04:49.660> that

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
get towards the end and you have that

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.800 
get towards the end and you have that
piece<00:04:50.110> of<00:04:50.320> hair<00:04:50.560> in<00:04:50.590> the<00:04:50.920> middle<00:04:51.510> you<00:04:52.510> take

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
piece of hair in the middle you take

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.760 
piece of hair in the middle you take
that<00:04:53.050> -<00:04:54.060> you<00:04:55.060> take<00:04:55.300> the<00:04:55.450> two<00:04:55.630> pieces<00:04:55.930> of<00:04:56.380> yarn

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
that - you take the two pieces of yarn

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.280 
that - you take the two pieces of yarn
and<00:04:57.430> you<00:04:58.120> put<00:04:58.360> it<00:04:58.480> in<00:04:58.600> the<00:04:58.720> middle<00:04:58.930> and<00:04:59.230> you

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
and you put it in the middle and you

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.220 
and you put it in the middle and you
cover<00:04:59.650> that<00:04:59.919> so<00:05:00.220> you<00:05:00.280> braid<00:05:00.700> down<00:05:01.000> and<00:05:01.540> then

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
cover that so you braid down and then

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.520 
cover that so you braid down and then
we'll<00:05:02.380> cover<00:05:03.000> that<00:05:04.000> that<00:05:04.960> little<00:05:05.230> piece<00:05:05.380> of

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
we'll cover that that little piece of

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.440 
we'll cover that that little piece of
hair<00:05:05.740> and<00:05:05.980> I'll<00:05:06.160> keep<00:05:06.460> it<00:05:06.640> from<00:05:06.790> sticking<00:05:07.090> out

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
hair and I'll keep it from sticking out

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.210 
hair and I'll keep it from sticking out
so<00:05:08.050> again<00:05:08.200> you're<00:05:08.470> gonna<00:05:08.560> have<00:05:08.770> to<00:05:08.830> watch<00:05:09.010> out

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
so again you're gonna have to watch out

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.520 
so again you're gonna have to watch out
when<00:05:09.370> you<00:05:09.430> get<00:05:09.669> ready<00:05:09.880> to<00:05:10.000> take<00:05:10.360> down<00:05:10.660> you<00:05:11.320> know

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
when you get ready to take down you know

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.560 
when you get ready to take down you know
that<00:05:11.560> even<00:05:12.430> though<00:05:12.610> you<00:05:12.760> see<00:05:13.030> the<00:05:13.180> fuzzies

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
that even though you see the fuzzies

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:14.820 
that even though you see the fuzzies
right<00:05:13.780> here<00:05:14.020> you're<00:05:14.200> gonna<00:05:14.320> have<00:05:14.530> to<00:05:14.650> go<00:05:14.800> down

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
right here you're gonna have to go down

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.260 
right here you're gonna have to go down
another<00:05:15.310> inch<00:05:15.520> to<00:05:15.730> an<00:05:15.910> inch<00:05:16.060> and<00:05:16.150> a<00:05:16.240> half

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
another inch to an inch and a half

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.610 
another inch to an inch and a half
because<00:05:16.600> that's<00:05:16.960> where<00:05:17.140> your<00:05:17.260> hair<00:05:17.410> is<00:05:17.440> going

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
because that's where your hair is going

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.620 
because that's where your hair is going
to<00:05:17.680> be<00:05:17.830> at<00:05:17.980> because<00:05:18.700> you're<00:05:19.240> not<00:05:19.300> gonna<00:05:19.480> be

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
to be at because you're not gonna be

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:20.909 
to be at because you're not gonna be
able<00:05:19.690> to<00:05:19.840> see<00:05:19.990> it<00:05:20.110> it's<00:05:20.290> not<00:05:20.320> gonna<00:05:20.530> be<00:05:20.740> as

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 
able to see it it's not gonna be as

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:23.250 
able to see it it's not gonna be as
fuzzy<00:05:21.520> because<00:05:22.210> it's<00:05:22.630> protected<00:05:23.110> by<00:05:23.200> two

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
fuzzy because it's protected by two

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.770 
fuzzy because it's protected by two
pieces<00:05:23.860> of<00:05:23.980> yarn<00:05:24.040> and<00:05:24.880> that's<00:05:25.090> it<00:05:25.390> and<00:05:25.630> when

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
pieces of yarn and that's it and when

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.630 
pieces of yarn and that's it and when
you<00:05:25.930> get<00:05:26.050> to<00:05:26.230> the<00:05:26.350> end<00:05:28.919> you<00:05:29.919> tie<00:05:30.220> it<00:05:30.280> in<00:05:30.520> a<00:05:30.610> knot

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
you get to the end you tie it in a knot

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.080 
you get to the end you tie it in a knot
like<00:05:30.820> this<00:05:31.530> snip<00:05:32.530> it<00:05:32.710> in<00:05:32.860> and<00:05:33.130> just<00:05:33.340> slightly

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
like this snip it in and just slightly

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.700 
like this snip it in and just slightly
burn<00:05:34.570> it<00:05:34.750> you<00:05:34.840> don't<00:05:35.110> want<00:05:35.230> to<00:05:35.290> burn<00:05:35.440> it<00:05:35.500> too

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
burn it you don't want to burn it too

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.620 
burn it you don't want to burn it too
much<00:05:35.919> because<00:05:36.100> they'll<00:05:36.340> turn<00:05:36.550> it<00:05:36.700> down<00:05:36.910> and<00:05:37.419> if

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
much because they'll turn it down and if

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:38.940 
much because they'll turn it down and if
you're<00:05:37.750> looking<00:05:37.870> for<00:05:38.230> a<00:05:38.260> more<00:05:38.410> natural<00:05:38.830> look

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
you're looking for a more natural look

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.350 
you're looking for a more natural look

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
you don't want to have your hands brown

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.320 
you don't want to have your hands brown
