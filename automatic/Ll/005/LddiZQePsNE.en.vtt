Glynn<00:00:00.900> is<00:00:00.930> about<00:00:01.380> to<00:00:01.560> do<00:00:01.740> an<00:00:02.040> SRT<00:00:03.259> slackline

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
Glynn is about to do an SRT slackline

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.789 
Glynn is about to do an SRT slackline
traverse<00:00:05.160> by<00:00:06.000> slackline<00:00:06.750> I<00:00:06.990> mean<00:00:07.319> that<00:00:07.649> we

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
traverse by slackline I mean that we

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.890 
traverse by slackline I mean that we
haven't<00:00:08.069> put<00:00:08.400> a<00:00:08.429> lot<00:00:08.639> of<00:00:08.790> tension<00:00:09.059> in<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:09.540> rope

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
haven't put a lot of tension in the rope

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.950 
haven't put a lot of tension in the rope
he's<00:00:10.469> going<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.769> transfer<00:00:11.070> on<00:00:11.550> we<00:00:12.210> simply<00:00:12.690> pull

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
he's going to transfer on we simply pull

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.259 
he's going to transfer on we simply pull
it<00:00:12.990> tight<00:00:13.320> by<00:00:13.590> hand<00:00:13.860> tie<00:00:14.490> it<00:00:14.549> off<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.120> that's

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
it tight by hand tie it off and that's

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.170 
it tight by hand tie it off and that's
all<00:00:15.450> we<00:00:15.599> do<00:00:15.830> he's<00:00:16.830> starting<00:00:17.310> from<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.580> DRT

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
all we do he's starting from a DRT

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.390 
all we do he's starting from a DRT
sitting<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:18.840> he<00:00:18.960> will<00:00:19.109> put<00:00:19.439> raise<00:00:19.680> himself<00:00:19.980> up

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
sitting and he will put raise himself up

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.939 
sitting and he will put raise himself up
until<00:00:21.270> he<00:00:21.420> can<00:00:21.570> attach<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.289> pulley<00:00:22.619> that's

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
until he can attach to a pulley that's

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.009 
until he can attach to a pulley that's
already<00:00:23.279> on<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.699> Traverse<00:00:23.880> line<00:00:24.359> there's

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
already on the Traverse line there's

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.589 
already on the Traverse line there's
also<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.500> b-line<00:00:26.099> friction<00:00:26.699> hitch<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.240> provide

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
also a b-line friction hitch to provide

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.870 
also a b-line friction hitch to provide
a<00:00:27.810> progress<00:00:28.590> capture<00:00:28.859> when<00:00:29.279> he<00:00:29.369> gets<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.760> the

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
a progress capture when he gets to the

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.319 
a progress capture when he gets to the
other<00:00:29.910> side<00:00:31.309> one<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.520> things<00:00:32.820> that's<00:00:33.059> not

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
other side one of the things that's not

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.180 
other side one of the things that's not
at<00:00:33.510> all<00:00:33.600> obvious<00:00:33.870> about<00:00:34.410> this<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.950> how<00:00:35.130> you

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
at all obvious about this is how you

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.090 
at all obvious about this is how you
actually<00:00:35.610> free<00:00:36.270> yourself<00:00:36.780> from<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.140> DRT

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
actually free yourself from that DRT

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.610 
actually free yourself from that DRT
setting<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.730> recover<00:00:39.600> your<00:00:39.809> rope<00:00:40.110> before<00:00:40.350> you

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
setting and recover your rope before you

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.209 
setting and recover your rope before you
go<00:00:40.950> across<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.610> Traverse<00:00:42.110> well<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.440> find<00:00:43.920> that

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
go across the Traverse well it find that

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.250 
go across the Traverse well it find that
once<00:00:44.579> you've<00:00:44.730> loaded<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.329> Traverse<00:00:45.629> line<00:00:45.960> as

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
once you've loaded that Traverse line as

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.920 
once you've loaded that Traverse line as
you<00:00:46.559> release<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.280> DRT<00:00:47.850> setting<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.510> just<00:00:48.780> go

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
you release the DRT setting you just go

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.750 
you release the DRT setting you just go
further<00:00:49.230> down<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.800> Traverse<00:00:50.129> line<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.670> you

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
further down the Traverse line and you

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.049 
further down the Traverse line and you
still<00:00:51.059> can't<00:00:51.780> free<00:00:52.050> up<00:00:52.230> your<00:00:52.260> DRT<00:00:52.949> setting<00:00:53.370> so

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
still can't free up your DRT setting so

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.750 
still can't free up your DRT setting so
to<00:00:54.120> deal<00:00:54.420> with<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.840> we<00:00:55.320> attach<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:56.039> tether<00:00:56.370> to

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
to deal with that we attach a tether to

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.299 
to deal with that we attach a tether to
the<00:00:56.879> Delta<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.840> attaches<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.739> Traverse

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
the Delta that attaches the Traverse

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.549 
the Delta that attaches the Traverse
line<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.059> we<00:01:00.539> tie<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.809> other<00:01:01.079> end<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.440> that

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
line and we tie the other end of that

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.650 
line and we tie the other end of that
tether<00:01:01.890> through<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.520> special<00:01:03.059> release<00:01:03.359> hitch

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
tether through a special release hitch

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.560 
tether through a special release hitch
back<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.229> our<00:01:04.379> saddle<00:01:05.060> once<00:01:06.060> we've<00:01:06.330> got<00:01:06.540> our

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
back to our saddle once we've got our

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.380 
back to our saddle once we've got our
diarchy<00:01:07.409> setting<00:01:07.920> free<00:01:08.250> then<00:01:08.490> we<00:01:08.880> pull<00:01:09.210> that

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
diarchy setting free then we pull that

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.740 
diarchy setting free then we pull that
release<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.200> we<00:01:10.710> go<00:01:10.920> sailing<00:01:11.460> down<00:01:11.670> the

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
release and we go sailing down the

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.960 
release and we go sailing down the
Traverse<00:01:12.750> lap<00:01:13.280> it's<00:01:14.280> pretty<00:01:14.520> tight<00:01:14.760> now

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
Traverse lap it's pretty tight now

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:42.370 
Traverse lap it's pretty tight now
that's<00:01:15.689> about<00:01:15.810> right

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.460 

so

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
so

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.660 
so
over

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
over

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:54.460 
over
yeah<00:01:47.830> yeah<00:01:49.240> and<00:01:50.240> then<00:01:50.510> back<00:01:51.290> behind<00:01:51.320> it<00:01:53.470> and

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
yeah yeah and then back behind it and

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.100 
yeah yeah and then back behind it and
then<00:01:54.620> over<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:55.010> front

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.570 

it<00:02:00.110> won't<00:02:00.320> matter<00:02:00.440> I<00:02:00.619> think<00:02:00.650> just<00:02:01.040> pulls<00:02:01.310> loose

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
it won't matter I think just pulls loose

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.790 
it won't matter I think just pulls loose
anyway

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.260 

there<00:02:06.400> you<00:02:06.490> go

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
there you go

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.570 
there you go
it's<00:02:09.110> only<00:02:09.290> hich<00:02:09.560> I<00:02:09.710> know<00:02:09.770> that'll<00:02:10.160> do<00:02:10.370> that

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
it's only hich I know that'll do that

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:47.400 
it's only hich I know that'll do that
and<00:02:10.730> hold<00:02:10.910> that<00:02:11.090> securely

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.290 

let's<00:02:48.070> go<00:02:48.250> be<00:02:48.400> good<00:02:48.610> because<00:02:48.790> when<00:02:49.090> some<00:02:49.240> of

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
let's go be good because when some of

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.760 
let's go be good because when some of
that<00:02:49.330> slack<00:02:49.570> comes<00:02:49.990> out<00:02:50.170> it's<00:02:50.350> gonna<00:02:50.470> let<00:02:50.680> you

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
that slack comes out it's gonna let you

00:02:50.770 --> 00:03:55.880 
that slack comes out it's gonna let you
drop<00:02:51.010> below<00:02:51.160> this<00:02:51.430> limb<00:02:51.700> get<00:02:52.450> out<00:02:52.600> of<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.720> way

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.820 

if<00:03:56.400> we<00:03:56.610> had<00:03:56.790> a<00:03:56.820> pretty<00:03:57.450> good<00:03:57.570> downhill<00:03:58.290> it

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
if we had a pretty good downhill it

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:06.510 
if we had a pretty good downhill it
would<00:03:59.070> be<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.280> good<00:03:59.490> ride

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.310 

we<00:04:07.000> should<00:04:07.240> have<00:04:07.360> set<00:04:07.540> your<00:04:07.720> side<00:04:08.020> a<00:04:08.050> little

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
we should have set your side a little

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.780 
we should have set your side a little
lower<00:04:08.470> but<00:04:08.710> then<00:04:08.830> you'd<00:04:08.980> add<00:04:09.160> an<00:04:09.310> uphill<00:04:09.610> to

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
lower but then you'd add an uphill to

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.080 
lower but then you'd add an uphill to
get<00:04:09.910> over<00:04:10.150> your<00:04:10.360> nasty<00:04:10.810> yeah<00:04:11.730> it's<00:04:12.730> kind<00:04:13.030> of

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
get over your nasty yeah it's kind of

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:27.810 
get over your nasty yeah it's kind of
caught<00:04:13.330> on<00:04:13.510> that<00:04:13.660> limb<00:04:13.960> so

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:48.010 

you

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.470 

yes
