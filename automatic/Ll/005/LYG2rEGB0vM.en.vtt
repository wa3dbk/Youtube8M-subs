serve your customers with wet dishes but
that's<00:02:34.060> not<00:02:34.299> a<00:02:34.329> very<00:02:34.719> appealing<00:02:35.409> thing<00:02:35.919> to<00:02:36.189> do

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
that's not a very appealing thing to do

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.330 
that's not a very appealing thing to do
now<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:37.989> other<00:02:38.319> type<00:02:38.680> of<00:02:38.739> commercial

now the other type of commercial
dishwasher<00:02:40.060> is<00:02:40.560> what's<00:02:41.560> called<00:02:41.799> a<00:02:41.889> high<00:02:42.129> temp

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
dishwasher is what's called a high temp

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.050 
dishwasher is what's called a high temp
dishwasher<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:44.560> advantages<00:02:45.129> of<00:02:45.189> this<00:02:45.519> is<00:02:45.579> is

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
dishwasher the advantages of this is is

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.429 
dishwasher the advantages of this is is
you<00:02:46.239> don't<00:02:46.269> need<00:02:46.650> sanitizers<00:02:47.730> for<00:02:48.730> this

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:49.439 
you don't need sanitizers for this

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:52.409 
you don't need sanitizers for this
because<00:02:50.439> the<00:02:51.069> high<00:02:51.310> temp<00:02:51.609> dishwasher<00:02:51.849> is

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:52.419 
because the high temp dishwasher is

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:54.360 
because the high temp dishwasher is
going<00:02:52.599> to<00:02:52.689> go<00:02:52.840> over<00:02:53.469> a<00:02:53.500> hundred<00:02:54.069> and<00:02:54.219> eighty

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
going to go over a hundred and eighty

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.629 
going to go over a hundred and eighty
degrees<00:02:54.459> in<00:02:55.150> there<00:02:55.329> and<00:02:55.989> so<00:02:56.639> sanitation

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:57.639 
degrees in there and so sanitation

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:03.330 
degrees in there and so sanitation
chemicals<00:02:58.419> are<00:02:59.109> not<00:02:59.699> required<00:03:00.959> so<00:03:02.040> that's<00:03:03.040> a

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
chemicals are not required so that's a

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.159 
chemicals are not required so that's a
savings<00:03:03.879> cost<00:03:04.239> right<00:03:04.659> there<00:03:06.689> the<00:03:07.689> other<00:03:07.870> good

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:08.169 
savings cost right there the other good

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:09.569 
savings cost right there the other good
thing<00:03:08.379> about<00:03:08.409> that<00:03:08.829> is<00:03:09.040> is<00:03:09.280> if<00:03:09.430> you're<00:03:09.549> a

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
thing about that is is if you're a

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.089 
thing about that is is if you're a
high-end<00:03:10.090> bar<00:03:10.329> if<00:03:10.780> you're<00:03:11.109> a<00:03:11.139> winery<00:03:11.769> if

want to use a low temp machine because

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.309 
want to use a low temp machine because

of the sanitizer chemicals that are in

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.259 
of the sanitizer chemicals that are in
there<00:03:26.680> you<00:03:27.519> get<00:03:27.790> residual<00:03:28.659> taste<00:03:29.319> and<00:03:29.680> flavor

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269
