on back now I've only been doing this

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:44.530 
on back now I've only been doing this
guide<00:03:41.930> for<00:03:42.229> about<00:03:42.560> 10<00:03:43.519> minutes<00:03:43.759> and<00:03:44.090> I've

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
guide for about 10 minutes and I've

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.949 
guide for about 10 minutes and I've
already<00:03:44.750> received<00:03:45.310> six<00:03:46.310> green<00:03:46.639> drops<00:03:47.000> and<00:03:47.359> one

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.499 
already received six green drops and one
blue<00:03:48.349> now<00:03:49.159> before<00:03:49.370> you<00:03:49.609> say<00:03:49.819> who<00:03:50.000> cares<00:03:50.209> about

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:50.509 
blue now before you say who cares about

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:52.330 
blue now before you say who cares about
green<00:03:50.810> drops<00:03:51.139> and<00:03:51.379> blue<00:03:51.530> drops<00:03:51.889> again

green drops and blue drops again

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.030 
green drops and blue drops again
remember<00:03:53.120> that<00:03:53.479> the<00:03:53.629> drops<00:03:53.930> are<00:03:54.169> random<00:03:54.769> so

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
remember that the drops are random so

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.219 
remember that the drops are random so
although<00:03:55.250> we<00:03:55.609> haven't<00:03:55.849> got<00:03:56.150> a<00:03:56.329> legendary<00:03:57.019> or

00:03:57.219 --> 00:03:57.229 
although we haven't got a legendary or

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:59.140 
although we haven't got a legendary or
epic<00:03:57.620> drop<00:03:57.919> just<00:03:58.519> the<00:03:58.639> fact<00:03:58.909> that<00:03:59.000> you're

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
epic drop just the fact that you're

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.939 
epic drop just the fact that you're
receiving<00:03:59.479> drops<00:03:59.959> is<00:04:00.169> important<00:04:00.680> because

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:00.949 
receiving drops is important because

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:04.119 
receiving drops is important because
every<00:04:01.430> Engram<00:04:02.030> drop<00:04:02.359> you<00:04:02.569> get<00:04:02.840> is<00:04:03.049> in<00:04:03.560> theory<00:04:03.979> a

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:04.129 
every Engram drop you get is in theory a

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:06.309 
every Engram drop you get is in theory a
chance<00:04:04.519> to<00:04:04.729> get<00:04:04.879> a<00:04:04.909> legendary<00:04:05.569> or<00:04:05.719> epic<00:04:06.079> drop

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
chance to get a legendary or epic drop

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.129 
chance to get a legendary or epic drop
furthermore<00:04:07.189> if<00:04:07.489> you<00:04:07.879> think<00:04:08.180> only<00:04:08.359> legendary

furthermore if you think only legendary

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:11.379 
furthermore if you think only legendary
and<00:04:09.379> above<00:04:09.680> drops<00:04:10.039> are<00:04:10.219> important<00:04:10.699> that<00:04:11.209> would

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:11.389 
and above drops are important that would
