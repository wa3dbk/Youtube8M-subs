like<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.619> wild<00:01:04.890> card<00:01:05.159> which<00:01:06.119> will<00:01:06.810> let<00:01:07.020> you

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
like a wild card which will let you

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.090 
like a wild card which will let you
match<00:01:07.380> anything<00:01:08.329> okay<00:01:09.329> so<00:01:09.770> once<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.920> match

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
match anything okay so once you match

match anything okay so once you match
them<00:01:11.340> they<00:01:11.490> turn<00:01:11.759> into<00:01:11.999> other<00:01:13.039> objects<00:01:14.039> I

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
them they turn into other objects I

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.429 
them they turn into other objects I

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
guess yeah so you match three patches of

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.800 
guess yeah so you match three patches of
grass<00:01:19.649> he'll<00:01:19.889> turn<00:01:20.069> into<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.340> shrub<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.939> like

after um it shows you the percentage to

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:50.299 
after um it shows you the percentage to
a<00:04:47.849> certain<00:04:48.209> goal<00:04:48.889> we're<00:04:49.889> can<00:04:49.979> skip<00:04:50.159> around

a<00:05:05.309> version<00:05:06.179> which<00:05:06.659> is<00:05:06.689> essentially<00:05:07.229> unlimited

00:05:07.429 --> 00:05:07.439 
a version which is essentially unlimited

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:12.349 
a version which is essentially unlimited
turns<00:05:09.169> which<00:05:10.169> is<00:05:10.319> I<00:05:10.469> think<00:05:10.729> 699<00:05:11.729> something

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:12.359 
turns which is I think 699 something

00:05:12.359 --> 00:05:14.059 
turns which is I think 699 something
like<00:05:12.449> that<00:05:12.629> but<00:05:12.839> actually<00:05:13.409> well<00:05:13.619> worth<00:05:13.889> it

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:14.069 
like that but actually well worth it

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:16.129 
like that but actually well worth it
considering<00:05:14.489> the<00:05:14.669> quality<00:05:14.759> of<00:05:15.029> the<00:05:15.119> game<00:05:15.299> in

the top left corner there you have a

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:21.759 
the top left corner there you have a
little<00:05:18.179> a<00:05:18.359> turntable<00:05:19.349> where<00:05:20.339> you<00:05:20.579> can<00:05:20.789> store

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:21.769 
little a turntable where you can store

00:05:21.769 --> 00:05:25.069 
little a turntable where you can store
one<00:05:22.769> item<00:05:23.129> and<00:05:23.369> use<00:05:23.879> it<00:05:24.059> and<00:05:24.269> swap<00:05:24.779> it<00:05:24.929> out<00:05:25.019> with

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:25.079 
one item and use it and swap it out with

00:05:25.079 --> 00:05:27.529 
one item and use it and swap it out with
