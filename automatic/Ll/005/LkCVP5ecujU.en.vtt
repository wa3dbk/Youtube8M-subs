00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.370 
quite nice the device transmits audio
via<00:01:38.520> bluetooth<00:01:38.909> 4.0<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.840> range<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.229> about

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
via bluetooth 4.0 and the range is about

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.609 
via bluetooth 4.0 and the range is about
3.5<00:01:40.860> meters<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:42.840> call<00:01:43.049> quality<00:01:43.259> on<00:01:43.530> these

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
3.5 meters the call quality on these

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.530 
3.5 meters the call quality on these
four<00:01:43.829> network<00:01:44.159> orange<00:01:44.490> was<00:01:44.610> quite<00:01:44.820> nice<00:01:45.030> and

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
four network orange was quite nice and

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.030 
four network orange was quite nice and
there's<00:01:45.720> also<00:01:45.990> active<00:01:46.380> noise<00:01:46.560> cancellation

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
there's also active noise cancellation

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.800 
there's also active noise cancellation
so<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:47.549> will<00:01:47.700> improve<00:01:48.030> even<00:01:48.270> more<00:01:48.570> when

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
so this will improve even more when

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.050 
so this will improve even more when
that's<00:01:48.960> activated<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:50.430> can<00:01:50.460> also<00:01:50.700> listen<00:01:50.939> to

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
that's activated you can also listen to

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.219 
that's activated you can also listen to
music<00:01:51.180> on<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:51.600> device<00:01:51.780> which<00:01:52.049> works

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
music on this device which works

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.440 
music on this device which works
surprisingly<00:01:52.380> well<00:01:53.000> sadly<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.270> noise

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
surprisingly well sadly the noise

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.819 
surprisingly well sadly the noise
isolation<00:01:54.869> isn't<00:01:55.200> as<00:01:55.259> good<00:01:55.380> as<00:01:55.470> I'd<00:01:55.560> like<00:01:55.799> to

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
isolation isn't as good as I'd like to

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.190 
isolation isn't as good as I'd like to
be<00:01:56.130> when<00:01:56.640> you're<00:01:56.729> listening<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.060> music<00:01:57.210> this

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
be when you're listening to music this

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.660 
be when you're listening to music this
is<00:01:58.350> due<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.680> fact<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.159> earbud<00:01:59.520> is

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
is due to the fact that the earbud is

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.300 
is due to the fact that the earbud is
made<00:01:59.850> of<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.000> more<00:02:00.210> hard<00:02:00.450> plastic<00:02:01.070> due<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.189> this

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
made of a more hard plastic due to this

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.800 
made of a more hard plastic due to this
fact<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.850> doesn't<00:02:03.119> connect<00:02:03.360> with<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.570> inside

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
fact it doesn't connect with the inside

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.510 
fact it doesn't connect with the inside
of<00:02:03.930> your<00:02:04.020> ear<00:02:04.170> as<00:02:04.320> well<00:02:04.469> as<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.799> stand<00:02:05.009> ear<00:02:05.310> plug

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
might not be enough also because the ear

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.950 
might not be enough also because the ear
