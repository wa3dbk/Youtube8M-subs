00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
is a great addition and something I've

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.430 
is a great addition and something I've
been<00:05:03.460> looking<00:05:03.550> forward<00:05:04.120> to<00:05:04.240> for<00:05:04.660> a<00:05:04.720> very<00:05:05.110> long

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
been looking forward to for a very long

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.430 
been looking forward to for a very long
time<00:05:05.470> now<00:05:05.740> from<00:05:06.160> what<00:05:06.280> I<00:05:06.310> can<00:05:06.430> tell<00:05:06.820> right<00:05:07.120> now

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
time now from what I can tell right now

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.879 
time now from what I can tell right now
it<00:05:08.440> seems<00:05:08.800> as<00:05:09.039> if<00:05:09.070> this<00:05:09.669> might<00:05:10.120> only<00:05:10.570> be<00:05:11.020> for

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 
it seems as if this might only be for

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:15.000 
it seems as if this might only be for
GTA<00:05:12.490> 5<00:05:13.199> single-player<00:05:14.199> for<00:05:14.410> the<00:05:14.470> director

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
GTA 5 single-player for the director

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.070 
GTA 5 single-player for the director
mode<00:05:15.190> now<00:05:15.789> the<00:05:15.880> editor<00:05:16.090> might<00:05:16.449> be<00:05:16.600> different

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
mode now the editor might be different

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.420 
mode now the editor might be different
you<00:05:17.169> can<00:05:17.320> go<00:05:17.470> ahead<00:05:17.560> and<00:05:17.650> use<00:05:17.860> it<00:05:18.010> online<00:05:18.130> but

you can go ahead and use it online but

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.730

from<00:05:18.550> reading<00:05:19.240> director<00:05:19.900> mode<00:05:20.050> might<00:05:20.320> only<00:05:20.560> be

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
from reading director mode might only be

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.219 
from reading director mode might only be
for<00:05:21.520> GTA<00:05:22.210> 5<00:05:22.389> story<00:05:22.690> mode<00:05:22.810> but<00:05:22.930> I'll<00:05:22.990> keep<00:05:23.169> you
