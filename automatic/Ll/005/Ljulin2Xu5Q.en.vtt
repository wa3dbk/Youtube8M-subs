progress is a really important model in

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.370 
progress is a really important model in
terms<00:02:17.120> of<00:02:17.330> taking<00:02:17.630> kids<00:02:17.810> where<00:02:17.990> they<00:02:18.020> are<00:02:18.290> in

helping them go wherever they can go and
that's<00:02:20.900> really<00:02:21.050> what<00:02:21.230> early<00:02:21.530> childhood<00:02:21.830> is

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
that's really what early childhood is

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.890 
that's really what early childhood is
about<00:02:22.220> we<00:02:22.490> start<00:02:22.760> there<00:02:23.030> we<00:02:23.330> take<00:02:23.540> kids<00:02:23.750> were

there and take them where they need to

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.660 
there and take them where they need to
be<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.600> other<00:02:26.780> piece<00:02:27.230> that<00:02:27.260> we're<00:02:27.680> also<00:02:27.860> very

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
be the other piece that we're also very

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.190 
be the other piece that we're also very
proud<00:02:28.820> of<00:02:28.940> is<00:02:29.150> that<00:02:29.180> we<00:02:29.510> have<00:02:29.720> licensed

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
proud of is that we have licensed

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.840 
proud of is that we have licensed
professional<00:02:30.860> teachers<00:02:31.220> we<00:02:31.460> have<00:02:31.640> teachers

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
professional teachers we have teachers

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.630 
professional teachers we have teachers
that<00:02:32.030> have<00:02:32.320> their<00:02:33.320> early<00:02:33.800> childhood<00:02:34.100> license

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
that have their early childhood license

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.390 
that have their early childhood license
we<00:02:35.540> also<00:02:35.720> all<00:02:36.260> of<00:02:36.560> our<00:02:36.680> preschool<00:02:37.100> teachers

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
we also all of our preschool teachers

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.040 
we also all of our preschool teachers
have<00:02:37.520> over<00:02:37.790> 10<00:02:37.970> years<00:02:38.090> experience<00:02:38.270> teaching

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
have over 10 years experience teaching

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.500 
have over 10 years experience teaching
so<00:02:39.440> they<00:02:39.740> are<00:02:39.920> very<00:02:40.160> well<00:02:40.790> grounded<00:02:40.940> in<00:02:41.270> early

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
so they are very well grounded in early

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.030 
so they are very well grounded in early
childhood<00:02:41.540> development<00:02:42.110> and<00:02:42.620> I<00:02:42.650> think<00:02:42.860> that's

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
childhood development and I think that's

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.920 
childhood development and I think that's
a<00:02:43.160> critical<00:02:43.430> piece<00:02:43.700> our<00:02:44.090> multilingual

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
a critical piece our multilingual

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.990 
a critical piece our multilingual
classroom<00:02:45.650> has<00:02:45.770> kind<00:02:46.010> of<00:02:46.070> an<00:02:46.220> evolution<00:02:46.760> for

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
classroom has kind of an evolution for

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.140 
classroom has kind of an evolution for
us<00:02:47.150> it<00:02:47.420> is<00:02:47.630> what<00:02:47.930> we<00:02:48.110> are<00:02:48.290> now<00:02:48.970> taking<00:02:49.970> we've

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
us it is what we are now taking we've

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.180 
us it is what we are now taking we've
had<00:02:50.420> English<00:02:50.930> language<00:02:51.350> learner<00:02:51.620> preschool

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
had English language learner preschool

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.540 
had English language learner preschool
here<00:02:52.610> and<00:02:53.120> as<00:02:53.390> we<00:02:53.690> have<00:02:53.930> gone<00:02:54.770> forward<00:02:55.190> and

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
here and as we have gone forward and

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.949 
here and as we have gone forward and
looked<00:02:55.760> at<00:02:55.910> more<00:02:56.090> of<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.330> research<00:02:56.720> what

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
looked at more of the research what

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.140 
looked at more of the research what
we're<00:02:57.140> realizing<00:02:57.680> is<00:02:58.250> that<00:02:58.459> a<00:02:58.610> multilingual

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
we're realizing is that a multilingual

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.090 
we're realizing is that a multilingual
approach<00:02:59.570> is<00:02:59.750> actually<00:03:00.080> a<00:03:00.110> more<00:03:00.380> powerful<00:03:00.620> and

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
approach is actually a more powerful and

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.949 
approach is actually a more powerful and
more<00:03:01.250> effective<00:03:01.730> approach<00:03:02.090> so<00:03:02.450> what<00:03:02.660> we<00:03:02.780> know

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
more effective approach so what we know

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.690 
more effective approach so what we know
about<00:03:03.110> children<00:03:03.680> is<00:03:03.890> that<00:03:03.920> their<00:03:04.340> brains<00:03:04.430> are

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
about children is that their brains are

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.430 
about children is that their brains are
wired<00:03:04.730> to<00:03:04.940> learn<00:03:05.120> more<00:03:05.330> than<00:03:05.450> one<00:03:05.600> language<00:03:05.750> at

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
wired to learn more than one language at

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.800 
wired to learn more than one language at
a<00:03:06.830> young<00:03:07.220> age<00:03:07.250> unlike<00:03:07.790> us<00:03:07.970> they<00:03:08.000> are<00:03:08.209> ready<00:03:08.540> to

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
a young age unlike us they are ready to

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.720 
a young age unlike us they are ready to
learn<00:03:08.840> many<00:03:09.170> languages<00:03:09.739> so<00:03:09.980> what<00:03:10.250> we<00:03:10.700> are

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
learn many languages so what we are

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.420 
learn many languages so what we are
opening<00:03:11.270> up<00:03:11.420> to<00:03:11.660> is<00:03:11.959> a<00:03:12.200> classroom<00:03:13.070> where<00:03:13.250> we

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
opening up to is a classroom where we

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.240 
opening up to is a classroom where we
hope<00:03:13.700> to<00:03:13.730> have<00:03:13.910> not<00:03:14.870> only<00:03:14.900> on<00:03:15.410> several

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
hope to have not only on several

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.330 
hope to have not only on several
different<00:03:16.370> languages<00:03:17.209> Somali<00:03:17.840> Spanish<00:03:18.739> but

also English speakers and in addition we

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.910 
also English speakers and in addition we
have<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:23.150> support<00:03:23.570> of<00:03:23.630> a<00:03:23.750> Spanish<00:03:24.140> speaker<00:03:24.260> to

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
have the support of a Spanish speaker to

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.979 
have the support of a Spanish speaker to
help<00:03:25.160> the<00:03:25.459> spanish-speaking<00:03:26.060> kids<00:03:26.570> as<00:03:26.810> they

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
help the spanish-speaking kids as they

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.509 
help the spanish-speaking kids as they
learn<00:03:27.170> English<00:03:27.560> because<00:03:27.800> what<00:03:28.100> research<00:03:28.489> has

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
learn English because what research has

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.940 
learn English because what research has
told<00:03:28.940> us<00:03:29.180> is<00:03:29.450> that<00:03:29.480> when<00:03:30.380> children<00:03:30.410> are

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
told us is that when children are

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.040 
told us is that when children are
grounded<00:03:31.489> in<00:03:31.580> their<00:03:31.730> first<00:03:31.970> language<00:03:32.209> and<00:03:32.720> for

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050
