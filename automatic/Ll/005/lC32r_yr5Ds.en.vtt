okay<00:00:00.570> so<00:00:00.630> I've<00:00:00.930> decided<00:00:01.079> to<00:00:01.560> drill<00:00:02.429> the<00:00:02.580> holes

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
okay so I've decided to drill the holes

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.099 
okay so I've decided to drill the holes
for<00:00:03.149> the<00:00:03.179> pickups<00:00:03.990> before<00:00:04.470> I<00:00:04.740> do<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:05.819> final

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:06.109 
for the pickups before I do the final

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.310 
for the pickups before I do the final
sanding<00:00:07.109> on<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.560> edges<00:00:08.719> here's<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.960> single

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
sanding on the edges here's the single

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.900 
sanding on the edges here's the single
coil<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:10.889> use<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.969> distance<00:00:12.469> which<00:00:13.469> is<00:00:13.910> almost

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
coil I use the distance which is almost

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.800 
coil I use the distance which is almost
like<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.599> distance<00:00:15.839> that<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:16.440> have<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:17.160> the

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
like the distance that I have of the

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.040 
like the distance that I have of the
bridge<00:00:18.810> same<00:00:19.109> single<00:00:19.560> coil<00:00:20.010> in<00:00:20.160> my<00:00:20.310> strat<00:00:21.050> but

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
bridge same single coil in my strat but

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.410 
bridge same single coil in my strat but
what<00:00:22.439> I'm<00:00:22.529> doing<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:23.100> it's<00:00:23.640> not<00:00:23.789> tilted

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
what I'm doing is that it's not tilted

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.460 
what I'm doing is that it's not tilted
was<00:00:25.050> in<00:00:25.199> my<00:00:25.350> strat<00:00:25.710> since<00:00:26.180> I<00:00:27.180> want<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.109> obey<00:00:28.199> the

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
was in my strat since I want to obey the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.220 
was in my strat since I want to obey the
distance<00:00:28.890> between<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.369> strings<00:00:29.670> here<00:00:30.230> it

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
distance between the strings here it

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.500 
distance between the strings here it
doesn't<00:00:31.439> seem<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.949> match<00:00:32.160> if<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:32.820> if<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.149> do<00:00:33.210> like

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
doesn't seem to match if I if I do like

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.370 
doesn't seem to match if I if I do like
this<00:00:33.750> then<00:00:34.680> one<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.880> strings<00:00:36.239> either<00:00:37.079> the

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
this then one of the strings either the

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.040 
this then one of the strings either the
low<00:00:37.500> E<00:00:37.530> or<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.010> high<00:00:38.309> e<00:00:38.340> won't<00:00:39.239> be<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.510> line<00:00:39.750> with

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
low E or the high e won't be a line with

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.920 
low E or the high e won't be a line with
us<00:00:40.079> with<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.860> coils<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.940> I've<00:00:42.270> decided<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.780> do

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
us with the coils so I've decided to do

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.229 
us with the coils so I've decided to do
it<00:00:42.989> like<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.559> i'm<00:00:44.550> going<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.000> have<00:00:45.120> one

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
it like this and i'm going to have one

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.690 
it like this and i'm going to have one
single<00:00:45.809> coil<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.440> one<00:00:47.210> humbucker<00:00:49.700> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
single coil and one humbucker the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.760 
single coil and one humbucker the
humbucker<00:00:51.149> i'm<00:00:51.480> going<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.719> place<00:00:51.930> kind<00:00:52.710> of

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
humbucker i'm going to place kind of

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.990 
humbucker i'm going to place kind of
Midway<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.520> where<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.690> single<00:00:55.410> or<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.309> where<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
Midway of where a single or of where the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.779 
Midway of where a single or of where the
next<00:00:57.629> single<00:00:57.780> coil<00:00:58.170> or<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.800> middle<00:00:59.309> single

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
next single coil or the middle single

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.689 
next single coil or the middle single
coil<00:01:00.120> would<00:01:00.270> be<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:00.989> decided<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.949> put<00:01:02.579> it

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
coil would be so I decided to put it

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.740 
coil would be so I decided to put it
right<00:01:03.359> here<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.870> hope<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.650> fits<00:01:04.920> okay<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:06.119> i've

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
right here I hope it fits okay so i've

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.600 
guitar fireside because what we're going
to<00:01:48.560> do<00:01:49.180> is<00:01:50.180> we're<00:01:50.450> going<00:01:50.630> to<00:01:51.399> sand<00:01:52.399> the<00:01:52.580> edges

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
to do is we're going to sand the edges

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.190 
to do is we're going to sand the edges
and<00:01:53.299> test<00:01:53.899> on<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:54.770> guitar<00:01:55.130> and<00:01:55.750> dance<00:01:56.750> and

this<00:02:01.700> last<00:02:02.240> film<00:02:02.869> here<00:02:03.259> I<00:02:03.439> think<00:02:03.770> it's<00:02:03.890> going

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
this last film here I think it's going

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.730 
this last film here I think it's going
to<00:02:04.100> help<00:02:04.250> me<00:02:04.460> protect<00:02:05.270> a<00:02:05.570> bit<00:02:05.780> we're<00:02:06.590> almost

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
to help me protect a bit we're almost

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.660 
to help me protect a bit we're almost
there<00:02:07.360> only<00:02:08.360> a<00:02:08.599> couple<00:02:09.470> days<00:02:09.830> Moorhead<00:02:10.399> just

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
there only a couple days Moorhead just

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:29.110 
there only a couple days Moorhead just
kidding

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:03:17.950 

I

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:17.960 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.140 

it's<00:03:18.960> actually<00:03:19.110> more<00:03:19.710> than<00:03:19.950> 45<00:03:20.760> degrees

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
it's actually more than 45 degrees

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:28.000 
it's actually more than 45 degrees
something<00:03:21.540> like<00:03:22.670> 60<00:03:23.670> or<00:03:23.700> 70<00:03:24.180> degrees<00:03:25.910> then

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
something like 60 or 70 degrees then

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.770 
something like 60 or 70 degrees then
test<00:03:29.010> it<00:03:30.200> put<00:03:31.200> it<00:03:31.320> on<00:03:31.500> guitar<00:03:32.570> check<00:03:33.570> how<00:03:33.750> it

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
test it put it on guitar check how it

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.140 
test it put it on guitar check how it
looks<00:03:34.110> then<00:03:34.910> keep<00:03:35.910> doing<00:03:36.270> this<00:03:36.450> and<00:03:37.970> one<00:03:38.970> day

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
looks then keep doing this and one day

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.930 
looks then keep doing this and one day
