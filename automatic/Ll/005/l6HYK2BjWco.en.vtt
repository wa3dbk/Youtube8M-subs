the<00:00:18.420> arteries<00:00:18.840> that<00:00:19.650> leave<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.220> circle<00:00:20.609> of

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
the arteries that leave the circle of

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.029 
the arteries that leave the circle of
phyllis<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.240> how<00:00:21.960> they<00:00:22.140> supply<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.650> brain

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
phyllis and how they supply the brain

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.370 
phyllis and how they supply the brain
with<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.519> blood<00:00:23.760> if<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:24.810> purchase<00:00:25.230> my

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
with the blood if you purchase my

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.740 
with the blood if you purchase my
software<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:26.699> can<00:00:26.880> watch<00:00:27.060> all<00:00:27.300> these<00:00:27.510> lessons

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
software you can watch all these lessons

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.800 
software you can watch all these lessons
and<00:00:28.260> there<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.160> much<00:00:29.400> more<00:00:29.640> like<00:00:29.910> 3d<00:00:30.420> brain

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
and there is much more like 3d brain

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.240 
and there is much more like 3d brain
models<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:31.859> on

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
models and so on

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.510 
models and so on
ok<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:33.149> we<00:00:33.870> have<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.350> vertebral<00:00:34.950> arteries

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
ok so we have the vertebral arteries

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.990 
ok so we have the vertebral arteries
entering<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.390> skull<00:00:37.309> there<00:00:38.309> are<00:00:38.399> two<00:00:38.700> of

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
entering the skull there are two of

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.160 
entering the skull there are two of
these<00:00:39.480> vertebral<00:00:40.440> arteries<00:00:41.660> here<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:42.989> is

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
these vertebral arteries here this is

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.010 
these vertebral arteries here this is
one<00:00:43.379> vertebral<00:00:43.890> artery<00:00:44.600> then<00:00:45.600> we<00:00:45.780> have

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
one vertebral artery then we have

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.500 
one vertebral artery then we have
another<00:00:46.550> vertebral<00:00:47.550> artery<00:00:48.829> when<00:00:49.829> these<00:00:50.010> two

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
another vertebral artery when these two

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.670 
another vertebral artery when these two
vertebral<00:00:51.510> arteries<00:00:52.289> join<00:00:52.820> they<00:00:53.820> create<00:00:54.239> one

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
vertebral arteries join they create one

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.060 
vertebral arteries join they create one
artery<00:00:55.680> called<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.370> basilar<00:00:56.969> artery<00:00:58.070> before

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
artery called the basilar artery before

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.810 
artery called the basilar artery before
they<00:00:59.430> join<00:01:00.120> here<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.960> create<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:01.820> basilar

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
they join here to create this basilar

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.960 
they join here to create this basilar
artery<00:01:03.559> they<00:01:06.770> give<00:01:07.770> two<00:01:08.130> arteries<00:01:08.580> two

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
artery they give two arteries two

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.050 
artery they give two arteries two
smaller<00:01:09.270> arteries<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.930> join<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.850> create<00:01:11.850> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
smaller arteries to join and create the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.690 
smaller arteries to join and create the
anterior<00:01:12.840> spinal<00:01:12.990> artery<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.580> the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
anterior spinal artery this is the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.530 
anterior spinal artery this is the
anterior<00:01:15.090> spinal<00:01:15.600> artery<00:01:16.970> then<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.150> basilar

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
anterior spinal artery then the basilar

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.590 
anterior spinal artery then the basilar
artery<00:01:18.960> here<00:01:19.380> gives<00:01:19.710> away<00:01:19.890> smaller<00:01:20.759> fountain

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
artery here gives away smaller fountain

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.520 
artery here gives away smaller fountain
arteries<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.409> supply<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.890> pons<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:24.530> the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
arteries that supply the pons of the

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.319 
arteries that supply the pons of the
brain<00:01:25.799> ok<00:01:27.170> and<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.680> also<00:01:28.829> gives<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.640> anterior

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
brain ok and it also gives the anterior

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.550 
brain ok and it also gives the anterior
inferior<00:01:30.979> cerebellar<00:01:31.979> artery<00:01:32.430> here<00:01:32.850> ok<00:01:33.560> it

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
inferior cerebellar artery here ok it

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.859 
inferior cerebellar artery here ok it
gives<00:01:34.890> them<00:01:35.130> on<00:01:35.250> both<00:01:35.490> sides<00:01:35.850> then<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.570> gives

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
gives them on both sides then it gives

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.960 
gives them on both sides then it gives
the<00:01:37.200> superior<00:01:38.100> cerebellar<00:01:39.000> arteries<00:01:39.689> and

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
the superior cerebellar arteries and

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.219 
the superior cerebellar arteries and
those<00:01:41.970> arteries<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.750> just<00:01:43.020> mentioned

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
those arteries that I just mentioned

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.280 
those arteries that I just mentioned
supply<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.920> cerebellum<00:01:44.729> with<00:01:45.119> blood<00:01:45.450> and

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
supply the cerebellum with blood and

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.010 
supply the cerebellum with blood and
then<00:01:46.439> we<00:01:46.649> reach<00:01:46.920> one<00:01:47.520> really<00:01:48.240> important<00:01:48.659> area

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
then we reach one really important area

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.660 
then we reach one really important area
and<00:01:50.180> I<00:01:51.180> will<00:01:51.479> tell<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.170> now<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:53.159> basilar

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
and I will tell you now that the basilar

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.870 
and I will tell you now that the basilar
artery<00:01:54.409> gives<00:01:55.409> away<00:01:55.590> two<00:01:55.799> very<00:01:56.310> important

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
artery gives away two very important

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.859 
artery gives away two very important
arteries<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.750> those<00:01:57.899> Rd<00:01:58.399> posterior<00:01:59.399> cerebral

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
arteries and those Rd posterior cerebral

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.080 
arteries and those Rd posterior cerebral
arteries<00:02:00.869> now<00:02:01.680> before<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.040> continue<00:02:02.280> with<00:02:02.850> this

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.350 
then the internal carotid artery
separates<00:02:44.040> into<00:02:44.520> two<00:02:45.860> arteries<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:47.280> one<00:02:48.240> of

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
separates into two arteries and one of

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.820 
separates into two arteries and one of
these<00:02:48.510> arteries<00:02:48.930> is<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:50.540> middle<00:02:51.830> cerebellar

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
these arteries is the middle cerebellar

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.770 
these arteries is the middle cerebellar
artery<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.940> goes<00:02:54.210> this<00:02:54.510> way

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
artery it goes this way

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.850 
artery it goes this way
and<00:02:55.460> it<00:02:56.460> supplies<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.780> lateral<00:02:58.320> side<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.650> the

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
and it supplies the lateral side of the

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.420 
and it supplies the lateral side of the
brain<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.430> another<00:03:00.320> artery<00:03:01.320> is<00:03:01.530> actually<00:03:02.190> the

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
brain and another artery is actually the

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.670 
brain and another artery is actually the
anterior<00:03:04.100> cerebellar<00:03:05.100> artery<00:03:06.410> so<00:03:07.410> we<00:03:07.530> have

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
anterior cerebellar artery so we have

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.950 
anterior cerebellar artery so we have
the<00:03:07.800> same<00:03:08.040> thing<00:03:08.400> on<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:10.410> other<00:03:10.470> side<00:03:11.720> this<00:03:12.720> is

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
the same thing on the other side this is

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.000 
the same thing on the other side this is
the<00:03:13.790> middle<00:03:14.790> since<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:15.990> roll<00:03:16.350> artery<00:03:16.770> that

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
the middle since you roll artery that

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.640 
the middle since you roll artery that
supplies<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.430> lateral<00:03:18.209> wall<00:03:18.480> and<00:03:18.750> then<00:03:19.500> we

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
supplies the lateral wall and then we

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.050 
supplies the lateral wall and then we
have<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:20.130> anterior<00:03:22.970> artery<00:03:24.080> cerebral<00:03:25.080> artery

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
have the anterior artery cerebral artery

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.270 
have the anterior artery cerebral artery
the<00:03:27.060> anterior<00:03:27.660> cerebral<00:03:28.230> arteries<00:03:29.100> are

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
the anterior cerebral arteries are

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.240 
the anterior cerebral arteries are
usually<00:03:29.730> connected<00:03:30.300> with<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:31.250> anterior

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
usually connected with the anterior

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.750 
usually connected with the anterior
communicating<00:03:32.930> artery<00:03:33.930> here<00:03:34.610> so<00:03:35.610> remember

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
communicating artery here so remember

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.150 
communicating artery here so remember
this<00:03:36.330> was<00:03:36.390> the<00:03:36.720> posterior<00:03:37.530> communicating

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
this was the posterior communicating

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.850 
this was the posterior communicating
artery<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.450> this<00:03:40.140> is<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.440> anterior

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
artery and this is the anterior

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.910 
artery and this is the anterior
communicating<00:03:41.610> artery<00:03:42.540> now<00:03:43.500> before<00:03:43.860> I

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
communicating artery now before I

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.770 
communicating artery now before I

we<00:03:57.930> had<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.320> anterior<00:03:59.360> cerebral<00:04:00.360> arteries

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
we had the anterior cerebral arteries

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.970 
we had the anterior cerebral arteries
and<00:04:02.430> they<00:04:02.520> supply<00:04:02.880> pretty<00:04:03.750> much<00:04:03.959> the<00:04:04.170> anterior

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
and they supply pretty much the anterior

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.830 
and they supply pretty much the anterior
and<00:04:05.220> superior<00:04:06.110> surface<00:04:07.110> of<00:04:08.209> the<00:04:09.209> medial<00:04:09.630> side

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
and superior surface of the medial side

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.340 
and superior surface of the medial side
of<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:10.170> brain<00:04:10.440> okay<00:04:11.450> then<00:04:12.450> we<00:04:12.690> have<00:04:12.720> the

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
of the brain okay then we have the

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.090 
of the brain okay then we have the
middle<00:04:14.310> cerebral<00:04:15.120> artery<00:04:15.780> and<00:04:16.109> which

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
middle cerebral artery and which

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.699 
middle cerebral artery and which
supplies<00:04:17.459> the<00:04:17.489> insula<00:04:18.359> and<00:04:18.600> pretty<00:04:19.080> much<00:04:19.320> the

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
supplies the insula and pretty much the

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.270 
supplies the insula and pretty much the
lateral<00:04:20.549> side<00:04:20.940> of<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.120> brain<00:04:21.450> and<00:04:22.070> we<00:04:23.070> had

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
lateral side of the brain and we had

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.279 
lateral side of the brain and we had
more<00:04:23.520> very<00:04:23.820> important<00:04:24.270> artery<00:04:24.600> here<00:04:24.990> and<00:04:25.110> this

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
more very important artery here and this

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.580 
more very important artery here and this
was<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:26.240> posterior

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
was the posterior

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.350 
was the posterior
cerebral<00:04:28.590> artery<00:04:29.070> and<00:04:29.360> it<00:04:30.360> supplies<00:04:31.070> the

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
cerebral artery and it supplies the

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.940 
cerebral artery and it supplies the
posterior<00:04:33.360> medial<00:04:33.990> side<00:04:34.230> of<00:04:34.290> the<00:04:34.530> brain<00:04:35.810> now

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
posterior medial side of the brain now

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.280 
posterior medial side of the brain now
we<00:04:37.950> had<00:04:38.370> to<00:04:38.550> communicating<00:04:39.270> arteries<00:04:39.720> here

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
we had to communicating arteries here

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.970 
we had to communicating arteries here
and<00:04:40.530> here<00:04:41.360> then<00:04:42.360> we<00:04:42.540> had<00:04:42.720> three<00:04:43.140> communicating

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
and here then we had three communicating

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.880 
and here then we had three communicating
arteries<00:04:44.430> here<00:04:44.910> and<00:04:45.120> here<00:04:45.840> and<00:04:46.970> this<00:04:47.970> was<00:04:48.150> the

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
arteries here and here and this was the

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.680 
arteries here and here and this was the
internal<00:04:49.890> carotid<00:04:50.340> artery<00:04:50.670> this<00:04:50.940> is<00:04:51.120> where

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
internal carotid artery this is where

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.380 
internal carotid artery this is where
the<00:04:51.870> blood<00:04:52.110> comes<00:04:52.440> from<00:04:52.800> okay<00:04:53.240> through<00:04:54.240> the

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
the blood comes from okay through the

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.160 
the blood comes from okay through the
internal<00:04:54.810> carotid<00:04:55.140> artery<00:04:55.800> and<00:04:55.980> also<00:04:56.820> comes

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.170 
internal carotid artery and also comes

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.740 
internal carotid artery and also comes
through<00:04:58.170> the<00:04:58.350> vertebral<00:04:59.010> arteries<00:04:59.910> through

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
through the vertebral arteries through

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.810 
through the vertebral arteries through
the<00:05:00.930> basilar<00:05:01.380> artery<00:05:02.000> okay<00:05:03.000> here<00:05:04.370> so<00:05:05.370> usually

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
the basilar artery okay here so usually

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.470 
the basilar artery okay here so usually
the<00:05:06.180> blood<00:05:06.450> in<00:05:06.690> the<00:05:07.350> posterior<00:05:08.150> here<00:05:09.150> in<00:05:09.360> the

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
the blood in the posterior here in the

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.550 
the blood in the posterior here in the
posterior<00:05:10.760> cerebral<00:05:11.760> artery<00:05:12.420> comes<00:05:13.110> from<00:05:13.410> the

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
posterior cerebral artery comes from the

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.140 
posterior cerebral artery comes from the
basilar<00:05:13.980> artery<00:05:14.460> and<00:05:14.810> in<00:05:15.810> the<00:05:16.080> anterior

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
basilar artery and in the anterior

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.180 
basilar artery and in the anterior
cerebral<00:05:18.150> artery<00:05:18.960> and<00:05:19.170> in<00:05:19.290> the<00:05:19.530> middle

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
cerebral artery and in the middle

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.270 
cerebral artery and in the middle
cerebral<00:05:21.090> artery<00:05:21.720> the<00:05:22.260> blood<00:05:22.500> comes<00:05:22.770> from<00:05:23.100> the

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
cerebral artery the blood comes from the

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.750 
cerebral artery the blood comes from the
internal<00:05:23.970> carotid<00:05:24.390> artery<00:05:25.280> so<00:05:26.280> I'll<00:05:26.430> try<00:05:26.730> to

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
internal carotid artery so I'll try to

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.820 
internal carotid artery so I'll try to
pretty<00:05:27.000> much<00:05:27.090> everything<00:05:27.450> learn<00:05:28.050> how<00:05:28.290> where

pretty much everything learn how where

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.890 
pretty much everything learn how where
these<00:05:29.070> arteries<00:05:29.370> go<00:05:30.030> and<00:05:30.270> which<00:05:30.420> branches

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
these arteries go and which branches

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.780 
these arteries go and which branches
they<00:05:31.050> have<00:05:31.260> please<00:05:31.560> go<00:05:31.830> to<00:05:31.920> my<00:05:31.950> website<00:05:32.070> and
