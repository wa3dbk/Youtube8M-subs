power source I wanted to eliminate

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.180 
power source I wanted to eliminate
gasoline<00:00:34.670> electricity<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.809> was<00:00:36.930> just

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
gasoline electricity so that it was just

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.310 
gasoline electricity so that it was just
completely<00:00:38.190> powered<00:00:38.670> by<00:00:38.820> air<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.480> single<00:00:40.200> idea

of<00:00:40.680> air<00:00:41.010> powering<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.120> refueling<00:00:42.660> station

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
of air powering the refueling station

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.069 
of air powering the refueling station
which<00:00:44.149> the<00:00:45.149> important<00:00:45.750> things<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
which the important things that the

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.360 
which the important things that the
replenishment<00:00:46.469> stations<00:00:46.920> are<00:00:47.070> powered<00:00:47.340> by

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
replenishment stations are powered by

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.700 
replenishment stations are powered by
wind<00:00:48.329> turbine<00:00:48.690> balloons<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.170> float<00:00:49.440> about<00:00:49.680> a

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
wind turbine balloons that float about a

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.740 
wind turbine balloons that float about a
thousand<00:00:50.070> feet<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.309> there<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:51.300> those

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
thousand feet in there and so those

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.299 
thousand feet in there and so those
collect<00:00:52.199> kinetic<00:00:52.710> energy<00:00:53.039> from<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.280> wind

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
collect kinetic energy from the wind

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.880 
collect kinetic energy from the wind
convert<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.059> into<00:00:54.270> electricity<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.410> that's

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
convert it into electricity and that's

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.250 
convert it into electricity and that's
what<00:00:56.070> powers<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.610> station<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.180> allows<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.230> to

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
what powers the station and allows it to

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.830 
what powers the station and allows it to
compress<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.800> air<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:59.250> power<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.579> car<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.719> it

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
compress the air to power the car so it

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.299 
compress the air to power the car so it
doesn't<00:01:01.050> use<00:01:01.140> any<00:01:01.289> fossil<00:01:01.649> fuels<00:01:01.890> at<00:01:01.980> all<00:01:02.100> I

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
doesn't use any fossil fuels at all I

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.009 
doesn't use any fossil fuels at all I
started<00:01:03.120> off<00:01:03.329> with<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.570> bunch<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.899> different

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
started off with a bunch of different

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.950 
started off with a bunch of different
shapes<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.650> are<00:01:04.769> inspired<00:01:05.250> by<00:01:05.369> air<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.180> when

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
shapes that are inspired by air and when

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.050 
shapes that are inspired by air and when
you<00:01:07.350> know<00:01:07.470> fast<00:01:07.770> looking<00:01:08.220> forms<00:01:08.610> because<00:01:08.850> we

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
you know fast looking forms because we

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.570 
you know fast looking forms because we
wanted<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.630> be<00:01:09.690> a<00:01:09.780> fun<00:01:10.049> fast<00:01:10.619> car

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
wanted this to be a fun fast car

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.220 
wanted this to be a fun fast car
and<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.330> started<00:01:12.690> playing<00:01:12.870> around<00:01:13.050> with

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:13.230 
and so I started playing around with

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.990 
and so I started playing around with
those<00:01:13.470> corners<00:01:13.890> they<00:01:14.070> kind<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.340> guided<00:01:14.730> me<00:01:14.910> in

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
those corners they kind of guided me in

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.690 
those corners they kind of guided me in
which<00:01:15.210> direction<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.780> go<00:01:15.870> into<00:01:16.490> and<00:01:17.490> then<00:01:17.610> we

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
which direction to go into and then we

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.490 
which direction to go into and then we
kind<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.970> narrowed<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.360> down<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.540> one<00:01:18.720> design

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
kind of narrowed it down to one design

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.500 
kind of narrowed it down to one design
and<00:01:19.890> kept<00:01:20.190> you<00:01:20.700> know<00:01:20.730> kept<00:01:21.030> going<00:01:21.330> with<00:01:21.480> that

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
and kept you know kept going with that

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.170 
and kept you know kept going with that
and<00:01:21.920> that's<00:01:22.920> what<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.190> turned<00:01:23.430> into<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.970> real

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
and that's what it turned into the real

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.410 
and that's what it turned into the real
sleek<00:01:25.130> clamshell<00:01:26.130> design<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.850> top<00:01:27.120> shell

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
sleek clamshell design the top shell

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.390 
sleek clamshell design the top shell
bottom<00:01:27.900> shell<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.410> an<00:01:28.500> interior<00:01:28.800> piece<00:01:29.220> in

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
bottom shell and an interior piece in

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.130 
bottom shell and an interior piece in
between<00:01:29.760> just<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.720> would<00:01:30.810> be<00:01:30.930> really

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
between just so it would be really

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.110 
between just so it would be really
lightweight<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.860> simple<00:01:32.280> eliminating<00:01:33.000> all

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
lightweight and simple eliminating all

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.570 
lightweight and simple eliminating all
the<00:01:33.150> suspension<00:01:33.960> component<00:01:34.710> just<00:01:35.190> having<00:01:35.490> the

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
the suspension component just having the

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.760 
the suspension component just having the
shells<00:01:35.850> act<00:01:36.390> as<00:01:36.660> the<00:01:36.780> suspension<00:01:37.350> as<00:01:37.500> we<00:01:37.650> were

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
shells act as the suspension as we were

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.380 
shells act as the suspension as we were
developing<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.370> Dean<00:01:38.820> had<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.060> idea<00:01:39.180> of

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
developing it Dean had the idea of

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.960 
developing it Dean had the idea of
having<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.230> people<00:01:40.470> sit<00:01:40.650> back<00:01:40.830> to<00:01:41.010> back<00:01:41.160> so

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
having the people sit back to back so

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.870 
having the people sit back to back so
the<00:01:42.420> interior<00:01:43.080> the<00:01:43.680> front<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.550> rear<00:01:44.670> crash

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
the interior the front and rear crash

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.480 
the interior the front and rear crash
boxes<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:46.020> tank<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.830> all<00:01:47.010> housed<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.460> one

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
boxes the tank is all housed in one

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.820 
boxes the tank is all housed in one
carbon<00:01:48.060> fiber<00:01:48.270> shell<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:49.350> really<00:01:49.560> makes

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
carbon fiber shell and it really makes

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.110 
carbon fiber shell and it really makes
it<00:01:49.950> more<00:01:50.070> efficient<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.610> know<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:50.910> you're

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
it more efficient you know so you're

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.790 
it more efficient you know so you're
eliminating<00:01:51.630> thousands<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.260> thousands<00:01:52.710> of

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
eliminating thousands and thousands of

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.750 
eliminating thousands and thousands of
parts<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.340> think<00:01:54.000> for<00:01:54.120> the<00:01:54.150> form<00:01:54.510> designer<00:01:55.260> for

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
parts I think for the form designer for

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.380 
parts I think for the form designer for
performing<00:01:56.760> essentially<00:01:57.090> quite

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
performing essentially quite

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.420 
performing essentially quite
sophisticated<00:01:58.080> the<00:01:58.680> most<00:01:58.860> important<00:01:59.250> thing

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
sophisticated the most important thing

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.870 
sophisticated the most important thing
is<00:01:59.640> the<00:02:00.390> inspiration<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:02.010> offsprings<00:02:02.580> on

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
is the inspiration and the offsprings on

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.550 
is the inspiration and the offsprings on
technologies<00:02:03.510> like<00:02:03.780> by<00:02:03.960> technology<00:02:04.500> is

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
technologies like by technology is

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.530 
technologies like by technology is
smaller<00:02:05.130> air<00:02:05.400> compressors<00:02:05.910> smaller<00:02:06.240> breaks

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
smaller air compressors smaller breaks

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.630 
smaller air compressors smaller breaks
more<00:02:06.930> efficient<00:02:07.410> structures<00:02:07.830> etc<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:08.490> I<00:02:08.520> think

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
more efficient structures etc so I think

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.609 
more efficient structures etc so I think
the<00:02:08.820> most<00:02:08.910> important<00:02:09.300> for<00:02:09.420> us<00:02:09.540> is<00:02:09.570> company<00:02:10.050> is

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
the most important for us is company is

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.050 
the most important for us is company is
the<00:02:10.950> intellectual<00:02:11.250> properties<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:11.940> we're

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
the intellectual properties that we're

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.090 
the intellectual properties that we're
going<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.209> gain<00:02:12.570> from<00:02:12.780> this<00:02:12.990> but<00:02:13.470> of<00:02:13.620> course<00:02:13.860> it

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
going to gain from this but of course it

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.450 
going to gain from this but of course it
could<00:02:14.340> be<00:02:14.459> built<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:14.700> we'll<00:02:15.330> see

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
could be built and we'll see

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.520 
could be built and we'll see
you
