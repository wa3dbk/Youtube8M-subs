00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
and the Gibson's copy of the casino

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.270 
and the Gibson's copy of the casino
which<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.610> ES<00:02:05.880> 330<00:02:06.119> is<00:02:06.600> us<00:02:07.530> it's<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.069> full

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
which is the ES 330 is us it's a full

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.300 
which is the ES 330 is us it's a full
hollow<00:02:08.489> thin

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
hollow thin

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.370 
hollow thin
I<00:02:10.369> guess<00:02:10.910> then<00:02:11.150> line<00:02:11.480> or<00:02:11.720> thin<00:02:11.840> body<00:02:12.050> guitar

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
I guess then line or thin body guitar

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.380 
I guess then line or thin body guitar
but<00:02:12.800> fully<00:02:13.099> Hollow<00:02:13.340> does<00:02:13.700> not<00:02:13.880> have<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.150> block

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
but fully Hollow does not have the block

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.860 
but fully Hollow does not have the block
like<00:02:14.540> a<00:02:14.630> 335<00:02:15.489> it's<00:02:16.489> similar<00:02:16.670> to<00:02:16.790> 335<00:02:17.480> in<00:02:17.690> terms

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
like a 335 it's similar to 335 in terms

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.570 
like a 335 it's similar to 335 in terms
of<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.080> bout<00:02:18.650> and<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:18.980> shape<00:02:19.220> and<00:02:19.430> everything

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
of the bout and the shape and everything

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.790 
of the bout and the shape and everything
else<00:02:19.790> but<00:02:20.060> it<00:02:20.150> is<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.569> slightly<00:02:21.110> shorter<00:02:21.230> scale

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
else but it is a slightly shorter scale

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.729 
else but it is a slightly shorter scale
the<00:02:22.220> neck<00:02:22.400> is<00:02:22.580> set<00:02:22.849> a<00:02:22.880> little<00:02:23.060> further<00:02:23.330> into

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
the neck is set a little further into

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.979 
the neck is set a little further into
the<00:02:24.739> body<00:02:25.120> imagined<00:02:26.120> for<00:02:26.270> stability<00:02:26.480> sake

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
the body imagined for stability sake

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.589 
the body imagined for stability sake
because<00:02:27.650> it's<00:02:27.830> full<00:02:28.040> Hollow<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:28.489> so<00:02:29.420> it

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
because it's full Hollow and so it

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.479 
because it's full Hollow and so it
changes<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.110> scale<00:02:30.290> makes<00:02:30.530> it<00:02:30.620> scale<00:02:30.920> sort

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
changes the scale makes it scale sort

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:37.030 
changes the scale makes it scale sort
slightly<00:02:32.420> shorter<00:02:33.130> then<00:02:34.130> a<00:02:34.160> 335<00:02:34.940> scale<00:02:35.890> in<00:02:36.890> my

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
slightly shorter then a 335 scale in my

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.020 
slightly shorter then a 335 scale in my
opinion<00:02:37.340> that<00:02:37.430> makes<00:02:37.550> it<00:02:37.670> really<00:02:37.790> comfortable

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
opinion that makes it really comfortable

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.180 
opinion that makes it really comfortable
to<00:02:38.269> play<00:02:38.390> it's<00:02:38.810> one<00:02:39.019> of<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.170> nicest<00:02:39.349> playing

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
to play it's one of the nicest playing

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.670 
to play it's one of the nicest playing

guitars that I have and certainly the

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.990 
guitars that I have and certainly the
nice<00:02:42.830> it's<00:02:43.100> actually<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.459> nicest<00:02:43.640> plane

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
nice it's actually the nicest plane

guitar the bridge is stock and the

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.620 
guitar the bridge is stock and the
electronics<00:03:13.640> are<00:03:13.760> stock<00:03:14.000> aside<00:03:14.420> from<00:03:14.540> the

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
electronics are stock aside from the

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.330 
electronics are stock aside from the
pickups<00:03:14.930> obviously<00:03:15.410> if<00:03:15.739> I<00:03:15.920> was<00:03:16.040> going<00:03:16.160> to<00:03:16.190> keep

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
pickups obviously if I was going to keep

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.890 
pickups obviously if I was going to keep
it<00:03:16.489> I<00:03:16.549> might<00:03:16.940> switch<00:03:17.150> out<00:03:17.299> the<00:03:17.390> electronics

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
it I might switch out the electronics

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.330 
it I might switch out the electronics
there<00:03:18.019> okay<00:03:18.290> but<00:03:18.350> their<00:03:18.769> 14<00:03:19.130> year<00:03:19.160> old

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
there okay but their 14 year old

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.030 
there okay but their 14 year old
Epiphone<00:03:19.730> electronics<00:03:20.480> so<00:03:20.720> you<00:03:21.530> know<00:03:21.650> not<00:03:21.890> the

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
Epiphone electronics so you know not the

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.190 
Epiphone electronics so you know not the
not<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.400> top<00:03:22.579> of<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:22.730> line<00:03:22.910> but<00:03:23.150> they<00:03:23.660> work<00:03:23.840> so

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
not the top of the line but they work so

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.670 
not the top of the line but they work so
this<00:03:24.350> is<00:03:24.560> the<00:03:24.739> bridge<00:03:25.519> pickup<00:03:26.470> play<00:03:27.470> a<00:03:27.500> little

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
this is the bridge pickup play a little

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.650 
this is the bridge pickup play a little
bit<00:03:27.769> on<00:03:27.829> that

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
bit on that

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:49.690 
bit on that
[Music]

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.140 

so<00:03:50.700> that's<00:03:51.080> wide<00:03:52.080> open<00:03:52.440> it<00:03:53.250> warms<00:03:53.790> up<00:03:53.910> really

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
so that's wide open it warms up really

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.310 
so that's wide open it warms up really
nicely<00:03:54.330> both<00:03:54.570> pickups<00:03:54.810> warm<00:03:55.080> up<00:03:55.200> really

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
nicely both pickups warm up really

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.840 
nicely both pickups warm up really
nicely<00:03:55.620> when<00:03:55.860> you<00:03:55.920> roll<00:03:56.100> off<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.250> tone<00:03:56.550> maybe

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
nicely when you roll off the tone maybe

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:19.550 
nicely when you roll off the tone maybe
a<00:03:56.940> little<00:03:57.120> volume<00:04:17.120> so<00:04:18.120> that's<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.560> neck

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
a little volume so that's the neck

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.600 
a little volume so that's the neck
pickup<00:04:19.769> the<00:04:20.609> pickups<00:04:20.940> are<00:04:21.830> reverse<00:04:22.830> wound<00:04:23.190> so

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
pickup the pickups are reverse wound so

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.250 
pickup the pickups are reverse wound so
in<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.300> middle<00:04:24.510> position<00:04:24.570> you<00:04:24.900> get<00:04:24.990> noise

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
in the middle position you get noise

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.710 
in the middle position you get noise
cancelling<00:04:25.680> which<00:04:26.070> is<00:04:26.220> nice<00:04:26.430> with<00:04:27.120> the<00:04:27.240> p90<00:04:27.660> s

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
cancelling which is nice with the p90 s

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.320 
cancelling which is nice with the p90 s
they're<00:04:28.650> obviously<00:04:29.370> single<00:04:29.820> hole<00:04:29.940> pickups

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
they're obviously single hole pickups

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.050 
they're obviously single hole pickups
and<00:04:30.570> they're<00:04:31.230> susceptible<00:04:32.010> to<00:04:32.340> so<00:04:32.760> you<00:04:32.940> know
