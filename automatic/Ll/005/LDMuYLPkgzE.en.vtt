00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.510 

right<00:00:01.530> I<00:00:01.560> wanted<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:01.890> do<00:00:01.979> a<00:00:02.010> quick<00:00:02.129> video<00:00:02.460> just

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
right I wanted to do a quick video just

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.160 
right I wanted to do a quick video just
explaining<00:00:03.120> the<00:00:03.330> different<00:00:03.600> types<00:00:03.780> of<00:00:03.929> buying

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
explaining the different types of buying

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.920 
explaining the different types of buying
the<00:00:04.500> hold<00:00:04.770> versus<00:00:05.279> a<00:00:05.310> preset<00:00:05.759> bind<00:00:06.029> this<00:00:06.720> is<00:00:06.899> a

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
the hold versus a preset bind this is a

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.379 
the hold versus a preset bind this is a
spectrum<00:00:07.379> a<00:00:07.649> are<00:00:07.890> 7610<00:00:08.639> receiver<00:00:09.000> which<00:00:09.150> does

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
spectrum a are 7610 receiver which does

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.959 
spectrum a are 7610 receiver which does
both<00:00:09.660> so<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:10.620> can<00:00:10.800> demonstrate<00:00:10.950> that<00:00:11.400> I<00:00:11.610> plug<00:00:11.820> in

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
both so I can demonstrate that I plug in

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.110 
both so I can demonstrate that I plug in
the<00:00:12.120> bind<00:00:12.360> plug<00:00:13.250> they<00:00:14.250> transmitters<00:00:14.730> off<00:00:14.880> I

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
the bind plug they transmitters off I

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.990 
the bind plug they transmitters off I
plug<00:00:15.450> in<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.750> power<00:00:16.020> lead<00:00:19.010> and<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.820> light

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
plug in the power lead and the light

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.720 
plug in the power lead and the light
flashes<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.689> bind<00:00:21.930> so<00:00:22.740> then<00:00:22.859> I<00:00:22.949> just<00:00:23.160> bind<00:00:23.400> in

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
flashes to bind so then I just bind in

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.019 
flashes to bind so then I just bind in
the<00:00:23.820> normal<00:00:24.150> way<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:25.490> you<00:00:26.490> can<00:00:26.640> see<00:00:26.670> that

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
the normal way and you can see that

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.790 
the normal way and you can see that
binding<00:00:27.630> desam<00:00:28.289> ixed<00:00:28.380> 22<00:00:28.980> milliseconds<00:00:30.800> so

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
binding desam ixed 22 milliseconds so

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.160 
binding desam ixed 22 milliseconds so
now<00:00:31.949> I've<00:00:32.099> got<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:33.090> then<00:00:33.239> plug<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.570> bind<00:00:33.809> plug

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
now I've got and then plug the bind plug

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.870 
now I've got and then plug the bind plug
but<00:00:34.350> I've<00:00:34.469> already<00:00:34.710> connected

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
but I've already connected

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.700 
but I've already connected
I've<00:00:35.969> already<00:00:36.180> bound<00:00:36.480> before<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:36.989> unplug<00:00:37.410> the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
I've already bound before I unplug the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.049 
I've already bound before I unplug the
bind<00:00:38.180> so<00:00:39.180> I've<00:00:39.809> got<00:00:39.989> my<00:00:40.110> controls<00:00:40.500> now<00:00:41.489> if<00:00:41.760> I

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
bind so I've got my controls now if I

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.389 
bind so I've got my controls now if I
hold<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.750> stick<00:00:43.020> up<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.980> I've<00:00:44.070> got<00:00:44.219> all<00:00:44.250> my

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
hold this stick up so I've got all my

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.139 
hold this stick up so I've got all my
sticks<00:00:44.760> up<00:00:44.969> if<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.660> turn<00:00:45.899> off<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.140> transmitter

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
sticks up if I turn off the transmitter

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.569 
sticks up if I turn off the transmitter
when<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.270> goes<00:00:48.360> into<00:00:48.510> failsafe<00:00:49.219> cycle<00:00:50.219> goes<00:00:50.370> to

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
when it goes into failsafe cycle goes to

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.490 
when it goes into failsafe cycle goes to
low<00:00:50.760> but<00:00:51.180> these<00:00:51.390> two<00:00:51.629> are<00:00:51.809> holding<00:00:52.020> their<00:00:52.350> last

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
low but these two are holding their last

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.310 
low but these two are holding their last
position<00:00:53.510> so<00:00:54.510> if<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.719> turn<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:55.110> back<00:00:55.289> on

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
position so if I turn that back on

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.610 
position so if I turn that back on
you'll<00:00:56.070> see<00:00:56.280> them<00:00:56.460> all<00:00:56.579> go<00:00:56.760> back<00:00:57.440> to<00:00:58.440> full

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
you'll see them all go back to full

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.810 
you'll see them all go back to full
throttle<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.129> middle<00:00:59.340> stick

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
throttle in the middle stick

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.619 
throttle in the middle stick
okay<00:01:00.359> now<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.289> alternate<00:01:02.160> bind<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.629> preset

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
okay now the alternate bind is a preset

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.590 
okay now the alternate bind is a preset
bind<00:01:04.369> so<00:01:05.369> do<00:01:05.430> exactly<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.000> same<00:01:06.030> thing<00:01:06.479> I

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
bind so do exactly the same thing I

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.170 
bind so do exactly the same thing I
plug-in<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.049> bind<00:01:07.260> plug<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.939> plug<00:01:08.939> in<00:01:09.060> the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
plug-in the bind plug I plug in the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.590 
plug-in the bind plug I plug in the
power<00:01:09.390> lead<00:01:10.580> as<00:01:11.580> soon<00:01:11.850> as<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.090> light<00:01:12.210> starts

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
power lead as soon as the light starts

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.450 
power lead as soon as the light starts
flashing<00:01:12.659> I'm<00:01:13.729> unplugging<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:15.720> bind<00:01:15.960> plug

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
flashing I'm unplugging the bind plug

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:25.730 
flashing I'm unplugging the bind plug
now<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:18.259> bind<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.619> same<00:01:19.799> as<00:01:19.950> before<00:01:24.560> okay<00:01:25.560> so

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
now I bind the same as before okay so

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.399 
now I bind the same as before okay so
I've<00:01:26.670> got<00:01:26.729> control<00:01:27.180> exactly<00:01:27.420> like<00:01:27.720> before<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
I've got control exactly like before the

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.870 
I've got control exactly like before the
difference<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:28.920> now<00:01:29.250> if<00:01:30.200> I<00:01:31.200> hold<00:01:31.579> the<00:01:32.579> servo

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
difference is now if I hold the servo

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.149 
difference is now if I hold the servo
positions<00:01:33.650> when<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.680> turn<00:01:34.920> off<00:01:35.040> the

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
positions when I turn off the

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.399 
positions when I turn off the
transmitter<00:01:35.340> they'll<00:01:36.090> all<00:01:36.299> go<00:01:36.570> back<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.990> their

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
transmitter they'll all go back to their

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.140 
transmitter they'll all go back to their
bind<00:01:37.680> positions<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.430> these<00:01:38.579> have<00:01:38.820> gone<00:01:38.970> back

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
bind positions so these have gone back

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.179 
bind positions so these have gone back
to<00:01:39.180> center<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.380> going<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.650> lay<00:01:40.770> throttle

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
to center this is going to lay throttle

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.300 
to center this is going to lay throttle
I<00:01:41.430> want<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.240> turn<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.450> back<00:01:42.659> on<00:01:43.159> they<00:01:44.159> would

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
I want to turn it back on they would

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.330 
I want to turn it back on they would
jump<00:01:44.490> back<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.060> positions<00:01:45.659> I'm<00:01:45.780> holding

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
jump back to the positions I'm holding

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.710 
jump back to the positions I'm holding
okay<00:01:47.340> now<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.090> really<00:01:48.329> useful<00:01:48.689> because

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
okay now this is really useful because

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.590 
okay now this is really useful because
say<00:01:49.200> your<00:01:50.780> flight<00:01:51.780> mode<00:01:52.020> for<00:01:52.380> your<00:01:52.490> Naza

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
say your flight mode for your Naza

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.359 
say your flight mode for your Naza
requires<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.750> certain<00:01:55.049> position<00:01:55.560> say<00:01:56.189> it

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
requires a certain position say it

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.539 
requires a certain position say it
requires<00:01:56.759> this<00:01:57.060> center<00:01:57.390> positions<00:01:57.750> failsafe

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
requires this center positions failsafe

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.600 
requires this center positions failsafe
if<00:01:59.549> you<00:02:00.479> use<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.079> preset<00:02:01.500> bind<00:02:01.740> then<00:02:02.159> that

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
if you use the preset bind then that

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.940 
if you use the preset bind then that
will<00:02:02.790> when<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.360> lose<00:02:03.869> signal<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.500> will<00:02:04.770> engage

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
will when you lose signal it will engage

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.039 
will when you lose signal it will engage
failsafe<00:02:05.369> if<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.360> don't<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.630> will<00:02:06.689> just<00:02:06.840> hold

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
failsafe if you don't it will just hold

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.540 
failsafe if you don't it will just hold
the<00:02:07.170> last<00:02:07.320> position<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.099> last<00:02:08.280> position

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
the last position that the last position

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.240 
the last position that the last position
was<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.239> were

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
was that you were

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.790 
was that you were
rolling<00:02:11.150> then<00:02:11.810> as<00:02:12.110> soon<00:02:12.290> as<00:02:12.380> you<00:02:12.470> lose<00:02:12.620> signal

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800

the<00:02:38.180> other<00:02:38.270> thing<00:02:38.360> I<00:02:38.420> just<00:02:38.450> wanted<00:02:38.720> to<00:02:38.810> show

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
the other thing I just wanted to show

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.610 
the other thing I just wanted to show
just<00:02:39.170> as<00:02:39.380> a<00:02:39.470> test<00:02:39.740> I've<00:02:40.130> got<00:02:40.370> a<00:02:40.490> metal<00:02:41.240> tin<00:02:41.660> is<00:02:42.560> a

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
just as a test I've got a metal tin is a

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.250 
just as a test I've got a metal tin is a
is<00:02:43.010> a<00:02:43.070> baked<00:02:43.370> bean<00:02:43.610> tin<00:02:43.940> and<00:02:44.239> a<00:02:44.270> metal<00:02:44.690> thing<00:02:44.870> if

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
is a baked bean tin and a metal thing if

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.310 
is a baked bean tin and a metal thing if
I<00:02:45.440> completely<00:02:46.100> encase<00:02:46.430> that<00:02:46.670> receiver

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
I completely encase that receiver

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.040 
I completely encase that receiver
I<00:02:48.380> still<00:02:49.370> cannot<00:02:50.090> get<00:02:50.360> that<00:02:50.510> to<00:02:50.660> lose<00:02:50.810> signal

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
I still cannot get that to lose signal

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.840 
I still cannot get that to lose signal
which<00:02:51.709> I<00:02:51.830> was<00:02:51.950> really<00:02:52.070> surprised<00:02:52.430> that<00:02:52.610> I

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
which I was really surprised that I

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.760 
which I was really surprised that I
thought<00:02:53.209> that<00:02:53.510> would<00:02:54.200> not<00:02:54.350> be<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.590> case

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
thought that would not be the case

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.010 
thought that would not be the case
anyway<00:02:55.190> so<00:02:56.060> that<00:02:56.270> is<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.660> difference<00:02:56.930> between

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
anyway so that is the difference between

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.240 
anyway so that is the difference between
the<00:02:58.300> preset<00:02:59.300> bind<00:02:59.510> and<00:02:59.840> a<00:02:59.930> hold<00:03:00.170> bind<00:03:00.470> instead

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
the preset bind and a hold bind instead

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.120 
the preset bind and a hold bind instead
of<00:03:01.310> what<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.550> hold<00:03:01.700> light<00:03:01.910> they're<00:03:02.180> flashing

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
of what the hold light they're flashing

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
of what the hold light they're flashing
I'll<00:03:04.130> just<00:03:04.280> quickly<00:03:04.459> once<00:03:04.730> I've<00:03:04.850> got<00:03:05.000> some

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
I'll just quickly once I've got some

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.290 
I'll just quickly once I've got some
other<00:03:05.209> receivers<00:03:05.690> I've<00:03:05.810> got<00:03:05.959> an<00:03:06.050> orange<00:03:07.300> this

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
other receivers I've got an orange this

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.270 
other receivers I've got an orange this
is<00:03:08.360> the<00:03:08.600> cheap<00:03:08.840> orange<00:03:09.170> receiver<00:03:09.650> which<00:03:09.830> is<00:03:09.860> I

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
is the cheap orange receiver which is I

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.790 
is the cheap orange receiver which is I
forget<00:03:10.610> the<00:03:10.730> model<00:03:11.000> number<00:03:11.270> and<00:03:11.590> but<00:03:12.590> it's<00:03:12.709> the

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
forget the model number and but it's the

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.560 
forget the model number and but it's the
cheap<00:03:12.980> six<00:03:13.190> channel<00:03:13.489> orange<00:03:13.640> receiver<00:03:14.120> this

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
cheap six channel orange receiver this

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.870 
cheap six channel orange receiver this
is<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:14.930> are<00:03:15.440> 800<00:03:15.920> X<00:03:16.160> which<00:03:16.400> is<00:03:16.549> the<00:03:16.670> eight

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
is the are 800 X which is the eight

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.150 
is the are 800 X which is the eight
channel<00:03:17.239> orange<00:03:17.510> receiver<00:03:18.230> this<00:03:18.950> is<00:03:19.130> a

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
channel orange receiver this is a

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.050 
channel orange receiver this is a
spectrum<00:03:19.670> a<00:03:20.000> are<00:03:20.450> 6210<00:03:21.380> and<00:03:21.650> this<00:03:22.610> is<00:03:22.880> a

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
spectrum a are 6210 and this is a

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.370 
spectrum a are 6210 and this is a
spectrum<00:03:23.900> a<00:03:24.140> are<00:03:24.530> 6100<00:03:25.489> E<00:03:25.840> and<00:03:26.840> I<00:03:27.019> will<00:03:27.200> just

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
spectrum a are 6100 E and I will just

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.370 
spectrum a are 6100 E and I will just
quickly<00:03:27.530> run<00:03:27.860> through<00:03:27.890> them<00:03:28.340> sharing<00:03:29.380> both

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
quickly run through them sharing both

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.570 
quickly run through them sharing both
modes

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.920 

so<00:03:34.580> there's<00:03:34.730> the<00:03:34.819> orange<00:03:35.000> six<00:03:35.659> channel

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
so there's the orange six channel

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.770 
so there's the orange six channel
receiver<00:03:36.170> so<00:03:36.680> I<00:03:36.709> plug<00:03:37.010> in<00:03:37.129> the<00:03:37.250> bind<00:03:37.489> plug<00:03:37.849> and

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
receiver so I plug in the bind plug and

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.319 
receiver so I plug in the bind plug and
I'm<00:03:38.930> pretty<00:03:39.170> sure<00:03:39.260> this<00:03:39.650> one<00:03:39.950> only<00:03:40.849> does<00:03:41.299> a

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
I'm pretty sure this one only does a

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:53.280 
I'm pretty sure this one only does a
hold<00:03:42.340> so<00:03:43.340> I<00:03:43.370> put<00:03:43.760> out<00:03:43.909> the<00:03:44.180> bone<00:03:44.390> plug<00:03:44.629> anyway

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.630 

so<00:03:54.290> that<00:03:54.409> just<00:03:54.650> does<00:03:54.799> a<00:03:54.829> hold<00:03:55.129> you<00:03:55.280> can<00:03:55.430> see<00:03:55.549> the

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
so that just does a hold you can see the

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.800 
so that just does a hold you can see the
throttle<00:03:55.909> ghost<00:03:56.090> delay<00:03:56.360> but<00:03:56.599> the<00:03:56.629> other

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
throttle ghost delay but the other

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.259 
throttle ghost delay but the other
channels<00:03:57.200> are<00:03:57.290> just<00:03:57.470> holding<00:03:57.650> I<00:03:58.060> just<00:03:59.060> quickly

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
channels are just holding I just quickly

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.349 
channels are just holding I just quickly
do<00:03:59.510> the<00:03:59.659> other<00:03:59.810> bind<00:04:00.079> just<00:04:00.500> to<00:04:00.650> prove<00:04:00.890> but<00:04:01.099> I'm

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
do the other bind just to prove but I'm

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:15.729 
do the other bind just to prove but I'm
absolutely<00:04:02.359> sure<00:04:02.750> they'll<00:04:03.049> do<00:04:03.260> the<00:04:03.379> same<00:04:14.739> yeah

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
absolutely sure they'll do the same yeah

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.689 
absolutely sure they'll do the same yeah
let's<00:04:16.190> just<00:04:16.340> a<00:04:16.459> hold<00:04:18.100> all<00:04:19.100> right<00:04:19.250> so<00:04:19.370> this<00:04:19.489> is

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:19.699 
let's just a hold all right so this is

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:23.050 
let's just a hold all right so this is
the<00:04:19.850> aar<00:04:20.359> 6210<00:04:21.289> and<00:04:21.590> I<00:04:21.739> already<00:04:22.400> know<00:04:22.820> this

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
the aar 6210 and I already know this

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.430 
the aar 6210 and I already know this
only<00:04:23.360> does<00:04:23.780> a<00:04:24.280> hold<00:04:25.280> bind<00:04:25.810> so<00:04:26.810> but<00:04:27.139> I<00:04:27.169> just

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
only does a hold bind so but I just

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.580 
only does a hold bind so but I just
prove<00:04:27.800> it<00:04:27.979> we<00:04:28.490> just<00:04:28.669> plug<00:04:29.000> that<00:04:29.169> plug<00:04:30.169> power<00:04:30.440> in

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
prove it we just plug that plug power in

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.040 
prove it we just plug that plug power in
so<00:04:33.590> that's<00:04:33.650> now<00:04:33.919> ready<00:04:34.130> to<00:04:34.310> bind<00:04:34.490> I'll<00:04:35.050> pull

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
so that's now ready to bind I'll pull

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.390 
so that's now ready to bind I'll pull
that<00:04:36.080> out<00:04:36.320> as<00:04:36.530> if<00:04:36.680> I<00:04:36.830> was<00:04:36.979> going<00:04:37.130> to<00:04:37.160> do<00:04:37.370> a

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
that out as if I was going to do a

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.879 
that out as if I was going to do a
preset<00:04:38.090> line<00:04:38.300> but<00:04:38.539> I<00:04:38.570> know<00:04:38.660> it<00:04:38.900> doesn't<00:04:39.050> work

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:53.580 

so<00:04:42.889> let's<00:04:43.070> binding<00:04:43.430> DMX

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.660 

so<00:04:54.590> throttle<00:04:54.920> goes<00:04:55.070> labor<00:04:55.340> the<00:04:55.550> other

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
so throttle goes labor the other

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.660 
so throttle goes labor the other
channels<00:04:56.090> just<00:04:56.300> hold<00:04:56.510> which<00:04:56.990> aren't<00:04:57.260> in<00:04:57.380> you

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:57.670 
channels just hold which aren't in you

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.660 
channels just hold which aren't in you
and<00:04:58.670> that<00:04:58.850> is<00:04:59.000> the<00:04:59.210> I<00:04:59.630> believe<00:05:00.290> the<00:05:00.410> AR<00:05:00.740> 6200<00:05:01.580> is

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670 
and that is the I believe the AR 6200 is

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:08.100 
and that is the I believe the AR 6200 is
the<00:05:01.790> same<00:05:02.200> it<00:05:03.200> will<00:05:03.380> only<00:05:03.620> do<00:05:03.980> a<00:05:04.840> hold<00:05:05.840> bind

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
the same it will only do a hold bind

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.800 
the same it will only do a hold bind
okay<00:05:09.110> now<00:05:09.260> this<00:05:09.410> is<00:05:09.470> an<00:05:09.890> old<00:05:10.220> AR<00:05:10.670> 6100<00:05:11.510> which<00:05:11.660> is

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
okay now this is an old AR 6100 which is

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.220 
okay now this is an old AR 6100 which is
a<00:05:11.840> dsm2<00:05:12.620> receiver<00:05:13.460> um

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.230 
a dsm2 receiver um

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:19.800 
a dsm2 receiver um
which<00:05:16.210> as<00:05:17.210> you<00:05:17.270> see<00:05:17.570> is<00:05:17.600> flashing<00:05:18.050> to<00:05:18.140> bind<00:05:18.410> I

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
which as you see is flashing to bind I

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:26.920 
which as you see is flashing to bind I
pull<00:05:20.810> the<00:05:20.930> plug<00:05:21.050> out<00:05:25.420> this<00:05:26.420> will<00:05:26.600> bind<00:05:26.780> up

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
pull the plug out this will bind up

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:34.330 
pull the plug out this will bind up
disome<00:05:27.320> to<00:05:30.970> now<00:05:31.970> this<00:05:32.210> I<00:05:32.630> believe<00:05:33.560> only<00:05:33.950> does<00:05:34.310> a

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
disome to now this I believe only does a

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.890 
disome to now this I believe only does a
preset<00:05:34.880> mind<00:05:35.120> yep

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
preset mind yep

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.960 
preset mind yep
they<00:05:36.110> go<00:05:36.500> lots<00:05:37.070> of<00:05:37.160> preset<00:05:37.490> biases<00:05:37.820> we're

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
they go lots of preset biases we're

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:44.320 
they go lots of preset biases we're
going<00:05:38.180> back<00:05:38.300> to<00:05:38.450> buying<00:05:38.630> positions<00:05:43.150> it's<00:05:44.150> not

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
going back to buying positions it's not

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.410 
going back to buying positions it's not
holding<00:05:44.540> last<00:05:44.840> position<00:05:45.290> now<00:05:46.220> I'm<00:05:46.550> sure<00:05:47.000> that

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:47.420 
holding last position now I'm sure that

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.650 
holding last position now I'm sure that
even<00:05:47.570> if<00:05:47.810> I<00:05:47.960> do<00:05:48.020> a<00:05:48.170> traditional<00:05:48.410> bind<00:05:49.570> it'll<00:05:50.570> do

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 
even if I do a traditional bind it'll do

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.110 
even if I do a traditional bind it'll do
the<00:05:50.810> same<00:05:50.920> because<00:05:51.920> I<00:05:52.070> think<00:05:52.130> this<00:05:52.370> only<00:05:52.700> does

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
the same because I think this only does

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.490 
the same because I think this only does
a<00:05:53.300> preset<00:05:53.810> bind

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:05.500 

thank<00:05:57.500> you<00:06:03.430> so<00:06:04.430> again<00:06:04.670> that's<00:06:04.790> a<00:06:04.940> preset<00:06:05.300> bind

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 
thank you so again that's a preset bind

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.930 
thank you so again that's a preset bind
I<00:06:05.720> should<00:06:05.900> have<00:06:05.990> destroyed<00:06:06.230> all<00:06:06.650> Stan<00:06:06.940> that's

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
I should have destroyed all Stan that's

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.420 
I should have destroyed all Stan that's
a<00:06:08.090> preset<00:06:08.420> bind<00:06:08.660> because<00:06:08.990> the<00:06:09.430> wallet

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
a preset bind because the wallet

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.410 
a preset bind because the wallet
channels<00:06:10.730> have<00:06:10.820> gone<00:06:10.970> to<00:06:11.120> their<00:06:11.240> bind

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:11.420 
channels have gone to their bind

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:18.730 
channels have gone to their bind
positions<00:06:15.310> they<00:06:16.310> go<00:06:16.490> and<00:06:16.730> this<00:06:17.720> is<00:06:17.870> a<00:06:17.900> disturb

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740 
positions they go and this is a disturb

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.320 
positions they go and this is a disturb
a<00:06:19.780> tradition<00:06:20.780> of<00:06:20.870> fashion<00:06:21.260> thing<00:06:22.330> originally

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
a tradition of fashion thing originally

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.620 
a tradition of fashion thing originally
the<00:06:23.540> bind<00:06:23.810> always<00:06:24.500> was<00:06:24.710> the<00:06:25.150> all<00:06:26.150> channels<00:06:26.570> we

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:26.630 
the bind always was the all channels we

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.510 
the bind always was the all channels we
go<00:06:26.750> to<00:06:26.810> buying<00:06:27.050> position<00:06:27.230> the<00:06:27.980> hold<00:06:28.220> was<00:06:28.490> a

go to buying position the hold was a

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.970 
go to buying position the hold was a
later<00:06:29.120> edition<00:06:29.630> which<00:06:30.020> in<00:06:30.290> some<00:06:30.620> cases<00:06:30.770> is

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:30.980 
later edition which in some cases is

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.610 
later edition which in some cases is
good<00:06:31.310> is<00:06:32.000> the<00:06:32.630> only<00:06:32.750> thing<00:06:32.960> that<00:06:33.110> matters<00:06:33.410> is

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
good is the only thing that matters is

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.140 
good is the only thing that matters is
that<00:06:33.650> you<00:06:33.920> understand<00:06:34.580> the<00:06:34.700> differences

that you understand the differences
between<00:06:35.390> the<00:06:35.750> two<00:06:35.930> binds<00:06:36.350> and<00:06:36.500> that<00:06:36.830> you<00:06:36.950> use

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.160
