00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
single board well I should hope so

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.220 
single board well I should hope so
otherwise<00:02:41.530> they<00:02:41.950> were<00:02:42.010> hammered<00:02:42.430> handles<00:02:43.230> but

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
gave me and put the two boards together

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.640 
gave me and put the two boards together
that<00:02:48.640> really<00:02:48.940> set<00:02:49.600> does<00:02:49.840> we're<00:02:50.080> good<00:02:50.290> doesn't

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.590 
that really set does we're good doesn't
yeah<00:02:51.250> sure<00:02:51.520> did<00:02:51.760> I<00:02:51.790> doubled<00:02:52.270> the<00:02:52.360> board

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
yeah sure did I doubled the board

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.330 
yeah sure did I doubled the board
lengths<00:02:52.870> to<00:02:53.080> do<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.320> filleting<00:02:53.710> and<00:02:53.920> then<00:02:54.310> I

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
lengths to do the filleting and then I

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.250 
lengths to do the filleting and then I
bridge<00:02:54.640> two<00:02:54.880> side-by-side<00:02:55.180> to<00:02:55.900> thread<00:02:56.140> the

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
bridge two side-by-side to thread the

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.620 
bridge two side-by-side to thread the
fillets<00:02:56.560> later<00:02:56.830> in<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.070> kitchen<00:03:00.510> yeah<00:03:01.510> and

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630
