00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:12.480
 it's very weird to explain but just not 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.480
 I could make the mother of that baby 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.450
 we have everything 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.980
 if they continue insisting that a 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:25.930
 hole is not a nest 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.930
 we do not understand we can not understand 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.119
 there is still much difficulty to be able 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.270
 hear that someone who begets a 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.309
 son poses detach 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:42.769
 just if it was an instinct out there 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:46.070
 a mother does not leave her child for me 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:47.860
 this social this of that instinct 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.610
 maternal 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:57.280
 so if you lost a point you are 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:58.720
 use your son I have the right to what 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.080
 difficult to recognize the right to 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.940
 another sees it basically as an act of 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.390
 lack of love look what he did is there 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.820
 same 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:12.020
 and look what we did this mare 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:16.880
 gave the chance to have a child 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:20.689
 there is a belly that gave birth to you and there is another 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:28.819
 mother who does not have a belly but has 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:31.340
 heart does not wait and waits while going 

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:34.369
 doing the procedures in our case 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:38.770
 for example this my boy was wrong with 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:41.630
 health and good at that time is to say yes 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.340
 I'm going to look for my daughter is there and I 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.649
 is waiting so it does not matter if it's 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.959
 sick if it is healthy we will see how 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.450
 it is solved after it is not news 

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:52.939
 when we leave it wrapped in the door 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.700
 of a house that is news now it is not 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:58.340
 news any doctor any 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.739
 hospital across the country will know that 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.590
 It is very common that we moms 

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:06.080
 let's escape and let a child in 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.110
 We are really leaving a child 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.979
 healthy in good condition than this 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.979
 It is also an act of love 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.030
 late 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.010
 to close a stage 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.830
 and keep going 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:30.730
 Knowing me adopted 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:34.180
 after that decision of that person 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:37.150
 and you are my son, I am your mom 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:41.200
 he told me that this lady asked him 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:45.640
 you're fine and she said if I'm 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:48.849
 well do you like dads that you have if yes 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:52.900
 I'm fine with them you studied did a 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:55.900
 heap if I studied good then it was a 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.599
 good decision I told him in that 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.959
 I could not have given you anything of 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.959
 all 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.129
 all right
