recycled<00:05:33.169> uses<00:05:33.620> so<00:05:33.979> maybe<00:05:34.910> there's<00:05:35.210> some<00:05:35.560> old

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560

precious metal I think that's kind of a
cool<00:05:54.470> thing<00:05:54.530> to<00:05:54.830> have<00:05:55.479> you<00:05:56.479> know<00:05:56.630> as<00:05:56.900> our

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
consumption goes up in fuel prices go up

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.189 
consumption goes up in fuel prices go up
