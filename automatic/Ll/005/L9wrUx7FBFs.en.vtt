00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
well old early bird started out as early

well old early bird started out as early
bird<00:00:41.059> worm<00:00:41.390> farms<00:00:42.020> and<00:00:42.350> we've<00:00:42.710> kind<00:00:42.980> of<00:00:43.100> grown

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
bird worm farms and we've kind of grown

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.119 
bird worm farms and we've kind of grown
into<00:00:43.700> just<00:00:44.210> farms<00:00:44.660> now<00:00:44.930> because<00:00:45.559> we<00:00:45.710> do<00:00:45.860> a<00:00:45.890> lot

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
into just farms now because we do a lot

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.029 
into just farms now because we do a lot
more<00:00:46.160> than<00:00:46.430> the<00:00:46.730> worms<00:00:47.079> but<00:00:48.079> primarily<00:00:48.410> our

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
more than the worms but primarily our

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.549 
more than the worms but primarily our
business<00:00:49.430> is<00:00:49.579> generating<00:00:50.239> worm<00:00:50.480> castings<00:00:51.230> and

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
business is generating worm castings and

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.850 
business is generating worm castings and
worms<00:00:52.550> for<00:00:53.450> the<00:00:53.539> composting<00:00:54.230> and<00:00:54.410> the<00:00:54.469> fishing

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
worms for the composting and the fishing

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.910 
worms for the composting and the fishing
industry<00:00:55.010> I<00:00:55.750> started<00:00:56.750> the<00:00:56.840> farm<00:00:57.110> with<00:00:57.350> an<00:00:57.469> idea

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
industry I started the farm with an idea

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.889 
industry I started the farm with an idea
and<00:00:58.300> I<00:00:59.300> got<00:01:00.020> a<00:01:00.230> plywood<00:01:00.590> box<00:01:01.070> and<00:01:01.660> 4400<00:01:02.660> worms

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
and I got a plywood box and 4400 worms

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:04.570 
and I got a plywood box and 4400 worms
that<00:01:03.230> I<00:01:03.350> had<00:01:03.500> bought<00:01:03.680> on<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:04.009> Internet

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
that I had bought on the Internet

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.670 
that I had bought on the Internet
and<00:01:04.670> I<00:01:05.089> figured<00:01:05.479> if<00:01:05.600> I<00:01:05.750> could<00:01:05.780> do<00:01:06.140> something

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
and I figured if I could do something

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.350 
and I figured if I could do something
different<00:01:07.130> than<00:01:07.250> what<00:01:07.430> I<00:01:07.490> was<00:01:07.729> already<00:01:07.940> doing

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
different than what I was already doing

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.190 
different than what I was already doing
I<00:01:08.780> could<00:01:09.170> spend<00:01:09.439> more<00:01:09.650> time<00:01:09.950> at<00:01:10.159> home

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
I could spend more time at home

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.770 
I could spend more time at home
worms<00:01:12.200> are<00:01:12.470> probably<00:01:12.979> the<00:01:13.580> most<00:01:13.790> beneficial

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
worms are probably the most beneficial

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.520 
worms are probably the most beneficial
thing<00:01:15.650> that<00:01:16.070> plants<00:01:16.790> can<00:01:17.030> have<00:01:17.780> around<00:01:18.170> them

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
thing that plants can have around them

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.980 
thing that plants can have around them
unlike<00:01:19.130> man-made<00:01:19.640> fertilizers<00:01:20.509> which<00:01:20.750> can

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
unlike man-made fertilizers which can

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.770 
unlike man-made fertilizers which can
burn<00:01:21.229> or<00:01:21.650> take<00:01:22.460> a<00:01:22.490> long<00:01:22.759> time<00:01:23.119> for<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:23.509> plant

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
burn or take a long time for the plant

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.190 
burn or take a long time for the plant
to<00:01:23.930> uptake<00:01:24.490> the<00:01:25.490> worms<00:01:25.759> actually<00:01:26.119> Ariat<00:01:26.990> the

burma<00:01:33.590> castings<00:01:34.310> is<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:35.030> richest<00:01:35.509> most

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
burma castings is the richest most

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.160 
burma castings is the richest most
organic<00:01:36.950> fertilizer<00:01:37.490> known<00:01:38.479> to<00:01:38.689> man<00:01:38.900> it's

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
organic fertilizer known to man it's

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.410 
organic fertilizer known to man it's
exactly<00:01:39.710> what<00:01:39.979> God<00:01:40.189> intended<00:01:40.729> your<00:01:40.909> plants<00:01:41.299> to

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
exactly what God intended your plants to

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.710 
exactly what God intended your plants to
eat<00:01:41.600> so<00:01:41.990> it's<00:01:42.680> a<00:01:42.890> very<00:01:43.159> prized<00:01:43.700> substance<00:01:44.479> and

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
eat so it's a very prized substance and

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.100 
eat so it's a very prized substance and
it<00:01:44.840> causes<00:01:45.110> growth<00:01:46.070> rates<00:01:46.430> of<00:01:46.700> say<00:01:47.110> three

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
it causes growth rates of say three

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.410 
it causes growth rates of say three
times<00:01:48.320> the<00:01:48.710> normal<00:01:49.040> growth<00:01:49.310> rate<00:01:49.579> on<00:01:49.790> a<00:01:49.820> plant

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
times the normal growth rate on a plant

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.990 
times the normal growth rate on a plant
without<00:01:50.780> worm<00:01:51.290> castings<00:01:51.979> and<00:01:52.189> the<00:01:52.310> yields

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
without worm castings and the yields

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.330 
without worm castings and the yields
usually<00:01:53.509> produces<00:01:54.020> about<00:01:54.290> twice<00:01:54.680> the<00:01:54.710> yields

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
usually produces about twice the yields

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.670 
usually produces about twice the yields
so<00:01:55.610> there<00:01:56.180> the<00:01:56.630> worms<00:01:56.840> are<00:01:57.079> very<00:01:57.439> beneficial

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
so there the worms are very beneficial

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.050 
so there the worms are very beneficial
for<00:01:58.159> plants<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:58.909> very<00:01:59.149> necessary<00:02:01.060> fishermen

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
for plants and very necessary fishermen

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.080 
for plants and very necessary fishermen
they<00:02:02.960> like<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.320> big<00:02:03.500> worms<00:02:03.799> and<00:02:04.250> people<00:02:04.969> that

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
they like the big worms and people that

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.109 
they like the big worms and people that
are<00:02:05.210> looking<00:02:05.329> to<00:02:05.540> start<00:02:05.659> home<00:02:06.170> composters<00:02:07.119> add

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
are looking to start home composters add

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.419 
are looking to start home composters add
worms<00:02:08.630> to<00:02:08.929> their<00:02:09.079> garden<00:02:09.290> soil<00:02:09.769> they're

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
worms to their garden soil they're

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.699 
worms to their garden soil they're
preferring<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.209> smaller<00:02:11.540> composting<00:02:12.470> type

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
preferring the smaller composting type

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.949 
preferring the smaller composting type
worm<00:02:12.980> so<00:02:13.430> really<00:02:14.180> it's<00:02:14.300> two<00:02:14.540> different

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
worm so really it's two different

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:15.649 
worm so really it's two different
markets

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
markets

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.569 
markets
you<00:02:16.019> have<00:02:16.200> people<00:02:16.560> buying<00:02:16.739> them<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.040> fish<00:02:17.280> and

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
you have people buying them to fish and

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.339 
you have people buying them to fish and
you<00:02:17.640> have<00:02:18.180> people<00:02:18.540> buying<00:02:18.749> them<00:02:18.989> for

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
you have people buying them for

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.360 
you have people buying them for
gardening<00:02:20.010> sort<00:02:21.620> one<00:02:22.620> good<00:02:22.829> thing<00:02:22.859> about

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
gardening sort one good thing about

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.940 
gardening sort one good thing about
