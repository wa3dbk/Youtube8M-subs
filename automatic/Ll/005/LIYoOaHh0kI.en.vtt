00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.860
 yes 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.920
 hello that such welcome to my mac mx am 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.080
 mario and today we are going to talk about a 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.460
 application that is called ps touch 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.619
 this application is linked with the 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.930
 adobe photoshop company this is in its 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.790
 portable application for ipad 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.230
 we can only use it in the ipod 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.000
 for the moment I think that later 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.099
 they take it out for other devices more 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.820
 small the application has a cost of 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:35.530
 999 from the us and 120 pesos from the itunes 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.250
 You can download them without any 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.809
 problem 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.030
 is constantly updating and 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.250
 really the environment is very very very very 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.780
 good if you do not have knowledge of 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.579
 design if you have not touched ever 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.230
 photoshop or if it's going to make it a bit difficult 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.519
 but it has tutorials that you can 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.320
 show step by step what it is that 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:51.699
 you have to do what I 'm going to do 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.379
 now is to show them the environment very 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.699
 simply of what it handles so that 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:56.589
 those who have knowledge can 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.859
 understand it and if not those that can not 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:01.780
 really know it is very simple and I 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:05.230
 I use photoshop for example to create 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.990
 the background of my mac mx I created the icon of 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.070
 miwa that mx in the my and some designs 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.750
 that I've been adding I've gone 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.190
 adding direct voting and now 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.140
 I want to learn how to use pc touch 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.730
 to do some tutorials and you can 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.140
 teach you because it seems that we 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.860
 leave your comments down below 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.000
 would like 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.670
 and we are happy to do it 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.540
 we are constantly going to start the 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.030
 application as such 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.640
 remember is linked with photoshop and 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.470
 the environment is very very friendly is very 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.720
 simple as I say you handle with 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.400
 money yes and it divides it into two parts the 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.430
 first part in which the above the 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.890
 bar shows you what this species is 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.840
 chain that is adobe trade cloud this 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.430
 function allows you to synchronize your 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.710
 images and upload them to the internet and 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.660
 share it with the adobe community or 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.430
 also you up some images that 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.680
 can be allowed by the actor 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.300
 it also allows you if you already have images 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.560
 created you can share them on facebook 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.720
 in keeping them in his cart and that 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.820
 decide your ipad and upload them directly 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.800
 in the credit service to the cloud or 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.770
 printing them also lets you create 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.640
 folders like the one I have there to test 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.380
 double it if you want to duplicate 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.670
 some file and modify it and not lose 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.040
 the original delete directly 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.720
 send them to facebook 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.790
 If you do not have knowledge, you acquire the 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.080
 application you find it in a 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.000
 promotion or something and you want to learn to 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.430
 use photoshop that is a very good 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.440
 option and you do not have to spend more than 120 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.480
 sit here where it says tutorials that 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.470
 I really liked the tutorials come 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.620
 very very 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.500
 they mark you in what goes before and 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.880
 then you give yourself start tutorial and the 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.020
 tutorial takes you by the hand in the part 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.600
 below it tells you what you have 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.000
 what to do, you are giving him the Sinai and 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.680
 nothing next to what the foquito and the 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.910
 final we 're going to a result you're going 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.650
 saying what you have to go 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.690
 following really very very good the 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.460
 tutorials so if you do not have 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.870
 knowledge nothing happens you can 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.150
 learn without any problem a very 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.230
 good option we will enter the environment 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.850
 at the bottom you will see the 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.470
 symbol of more than pressing it goes 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.670
 to show a canvas the canvas in 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.500
 photoshop means you can 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.090
 add text you can add a 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.220
 image can be some effect some 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.170
 type of brush and create something with the 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.120
 width and height in this case or the 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.920
 symbol with the image more to say 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.050
 that you can add images and power them 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.580
 create some kind of effect the good thing about 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.780
 this is that local photos refers to 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.760
 those that are included in the ipad 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.470
 creative cloud that you have to give yourself 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.150
 high so you can have already contain 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.610
 this bought with you bought this 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.350
 product you already have the right to access and 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.240
 you can check a little bit I'm going to 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.459
 research well for those who have 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.900
 doubt the camera if you like 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.640
 take something from the camera 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.760
 and they can do it 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.610
 or directly from google plus or 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.200
 facebook then it really is very very 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.510
 interesting in that aspect we're going to 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.940
 back let's see the symbol of more and 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.740
 canvas in this case is the environment with the 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.959
 which one you're going to work with and it's divided into three 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.090
 the middle part is the canvas is so 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.530
 transparent where is as a kind 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.850
 I pressed loop and here come 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.070
 all that if thou 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.050
 pressures show you inside them 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.010
 other submenus ie the wand is 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.390
 magical 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.480
 This painting tool 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.000
 clone plug tools delete and 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.190
 blur out of focus in this case if 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.950
 for example if you select this you can 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.870
 create you select brushes and you can 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.310
 modify images that little by little we are going 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.050
 go creating but those are the brushes 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.330
 who manages and the tools in the 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.579
 top part you can add images 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.560
 you can cut copy and paste as if 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.510
 was a with your finger but through your 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.730
 pencil you can also the option of 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.169
 select from select from fade 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.940
 is you say you can grab an image the 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:29.270
 cut out and send somewhere else 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:32.270
 You can also create effects for 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.669
 example of biasing is edgar means 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.810
 if you press your image see 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:38.570
 how was it 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.860
 with the frame would be in that form that 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.990
 it was meant to rotate 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.110
 you can turn it over and give it or something like 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.419
 why can you turn around we 're going to 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.610
 a no picture and some types of 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.889
 functions that is the left side 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.360
 remember what all the 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.980
 types of tools are bars 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.020
 tools and right side 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.060
 the layers is very important the layers 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.220
 the layers are all the objects that you go 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.620
 to handle in photos are then if you know 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.050
 handle layers I repeat I'll do the 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.520
 tutorials for the basics and can but 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.229
 if you do not enter the tutorials that it brings 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.570
 well the system and they will learn very 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.580
 fast on the top after the 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.169
 symbol of more than bending is this 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.840
 that has as a cross you can move the 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:19.130
 Image or adjustments settings are some 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.710
 effects that you can create at 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:24.290
 photographs brightness temperature removes the 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.150
 noise the color balance curves for 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:29.419
 in turning one side darker 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.669
 clearer the fx that is effects for 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:33.050
 objects that you have selected or 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:36.590
 images that you want to create some 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.720
 effect and the symbol of creating texts 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.360
 can rotate you can fill in canvases 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.300
 example use the fillings 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.150
 one click to color 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.650
 and here he leaves a color after I can 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.900
 add the plus symbol that would be another 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:53.919
 layer I'm going to leave an empty layer and 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:56.440
 we will also create what is another 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:06:00.390
 Canvas us when adding 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:03.020
 for example, we must add a text 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.020
 we are going to 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.540
 let's create it 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:13.750
 and then bigger 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:16.570
 let's apply in your for example if 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.670
 I leave any of these pressed 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.560
 accommodated and disappears remember that the 

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:24.249
 layers go in the order that you're going 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.079
 leaving for example let's accommodate 

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:28.929
 and point put the rule in this case 

00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:32.589
 text appears if you change what is the 

00:06:28.929 --> 00:06:34.839
 fill color we put another color no 

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:36.579
 it affects your text in the least 

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:38.499
 because it 's because it's another object then 

00:06:36.579 --> 00:06:40.839
 that 's part of what you have to 

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:42.999
 learn to work with photoshop and the 

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:44.709
 last button you press it and it shows you 

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:47.739
 the result is really the environment 

00:06:44.709 --> 00:06:50.709
 it really is very very very very very well 

00:06:47.739 --> 00:06:52.089
 I liked it very much let's give it to save 

00:06:50.709 --> 00:06:54.749
 so they can see what is the way 

00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:59.769
 They keep telling me to the nail to say no 

00:06:54.749 --> 00:07:02.949
 and that object here is my text in this 

00:06:59.769 --> 00:07:04.839
 case the the option that I made and that I 

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:06.369
 I can show it and you can create it 

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:08.529
 say that you can enter and create several 

00:07:06.369 --> 00:07:10.749
 images and being modified is the 

00:07:08.529 --> 00:07:13.659
 photoshop touch environment I hope that 

00:07:10.749 --> 00:07:16.209
 like it remember I'm mario if you liked it 

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:17.949
 I like to leave your comments below 

00:07:16.209 --> 00:07:19.269
 share it help me create more 

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:21.969
 subscribers will continue to keep growing 

00:07:19.269 --> 00:07:23.439
 I want to get to support more the channel that
