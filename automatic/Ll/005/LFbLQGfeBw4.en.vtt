00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:17.100
 the a4 sedan and the five- door sportback are 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:20.100
 with news in its 2015 line 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:25.109
 Why have not you noticed the 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:29.279
 changes that of course do not look 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:33.510
 external is pretty much the same but 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:38.100
 under the hood a new engine 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:45.739
 engine 2.0 of 180 horses gave way to 1.8 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.739
 from 170 horses less 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:53.760
 and it would be a setback a fall in the 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:57.870
 performance of new models 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.030
 nothing on this engine we added 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.320
 we added a second injection 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.780
 electronics 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.020
 so it is multipoint and also the 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.210
 injection of the internal parts of the 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.600
 have been reworked to have less 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.700
 friction and with that I kept my touch 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.520
 that is the strength necessary to 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.710
 move the king and with a little more 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.530
 adjust wine in the transition that is love of 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.869
 change to continuously variable 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.110
 we were able to maintain exactly the 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.960
 same performance is the same 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.170
 performance in terms of speed and 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:38.460
 terms I wanted without acceleration. 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.259
 engine 20% and 21% more economical 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.090
 So you mean, despite being a 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.369
 slightly less powerful performance 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.880
 continues the same there superform even 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:55.650
 I do not know, but I just believe in practice. 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:58.740
 is there when the decree is now and is not 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.820
 that the pilot was right in our test 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.330
 drive 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.850
 The new 1.8 turbocharged engine proved 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.810
 you owe in no way the old two 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.570
 points and for 170 horses show a 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.460
 more than enough time to 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:19.130
 to provide agile and safe driving 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.470
 and he still married very well 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.140
 eight multitronic prevention 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:29.000
 speeds that offers the option of 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:31.870
 shifting through fin behind the steering wheel 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.050
 by the way, the wheel of the new a4 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:40.000
 now had flat base which facilitates 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.000
 the entry and exit of the driver 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:49.690
 already the steering wheel of which 5 sportback not 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.690
 has undergone changes 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:56.629
 besides the new engine 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:03:00.680
 another improvement of the new ones to 4 and 5 was 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:04.310
 now factory installation of sensors 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:09.500
 but only the rear 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:11.750
 Well, the backup camera was missing and who knows? 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.930
 2016 line 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.209
 want to know more details of the new ones to 4 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:23.079
 and 5 2015 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:23.079
 then highway access point as BR
