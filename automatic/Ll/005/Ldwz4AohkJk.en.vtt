00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
this case to a new bicycle so I think

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.359 
this case to a new bicycle so I think
the<00:01:17.430> moment<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.119> get<00:01:18.240> on<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.540> or<00:01:18.689> everyone's

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
the moment you get on it or everyone's

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.260 
the moment you get on it or everyone's
realized<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.490> difference<00:01:20.640> show<00:01:21.030> your<00:01:21.180> way

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
realized the difference show your way

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.770 
realized the difference show your way
especially<00:01:21.479> on<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.899> cobblestones<00:01:23.390> just<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
especially on the cobblestones just the

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.590 
especially on the cobblestones just the

Flex in the back and the rear end is you
know<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:34.740> game-changing<00:01:35.069> I<00:01:35.610> think<00:01:35.819> it

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
know this game-changing I think it

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.490 
know this game-changing I think it
definitely<00:01:36.270> felt<00:01:36.390> like<00:01:36.630> it's<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.929> huge

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
definitely felt like it's a huge

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.190 
definitely felt like it's a huge
advantage<00:01:37.830> over<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.280> old<00:01:38.429> bike<00:01:38.640> bike<00:01:39.539> has

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.050 
advantage over the old bike bike has
some<00:01:40.409> significant<00:01:40.920> design<00:01:41.069> features<00:01:41.520> over<00:01:42.000> a

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
some significant design features over a

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
chapter building on what we've done

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.590 
chapter building on what we've done
already<00:02:10.500> with<00:02:11.009> pinna<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.790> Team<00:02:12.090> Sky<00:02:12.329> with<00:02:12.540> a

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
already with pinna and Team Sky with a

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.840 
already with pinna and Team Sky with a
Dogma<00:02:12.930> f8<00:02:13.260> last<00:02:13.709> year<00:02:13.980> quite<00:02:14.340> often<00:02:14.519> you<00:02:14.700> have

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
Dogma f8 last year quite often you have

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.490 
Dogma f8 last year quite often you have
quite<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.090> lot<00:02:15.269> of<00:02:15.420> small<00:02:15.690> innovations<00:02:16.350> all

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
quite a lot of small innovations all

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.259 
quite a lot of small innovations all
clubbed<00:02:16.860> together<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.549> create<00:02:17.730> quite<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.030> big

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
clubbed together to create quite a big

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.030 
clubbed together to create quite a big
performance<00:02:18.810> difference<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.799> it's<00:02:19.890> quite

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
performance difference and it's quite

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.560 
performance difference and it's quite
rare<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.640> can<00:02:20.760> have<00:02:20.880> just<00:02:21.030> one<00:02:21.150> small

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
rare that you can have just one small

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.810 
rare that you can have just one small
innovation<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.859> the<00:02:23.010> design<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:23.700> actually

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
innovation and the design that actually

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.370 
innovation and the design that actually
could<00:02:24.120> make<00:02:24.239> quite<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.510> large<00:02:24.780> difference<00:02:25.109> to

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
could make quite a large difference to

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.960 
could make quite a large difference to
performance<00:02:25.859> and<00:02:26.010> I<00:02:26.040> think<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.609> know<00:02:26.700> I<00:02:26.880> think

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
performance and I think you know I think

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.400 
performance and I think you know I think
we're<00:02:27.209> in<00:02:27.299> one<00:02:27.420> of<00:02:27.450> those<00:02:27.540> rare<00:02:27.780> situations

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
we're in one of those rare situations

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
we're in one of those rare situations
where<00:02:28.560> that's<00:02:28.739> what<00:02:28.890> we<00:02:28.980> got<00:02:29.100> on<00:02:29.160> our<00:02:29.250> hands

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
where that's what we got on our hands

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.280 
where that's what we got on our hands
which<00:02:29.609> is<00:02:29.640> fantastic

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.349
