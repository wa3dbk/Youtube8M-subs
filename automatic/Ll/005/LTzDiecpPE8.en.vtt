underground<00:00:25.619> sprinkler<00:00:25.860> systems<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.700> that

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
underground sprinkler systems and that

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.519 
underground sprinkler systems and that
is<00:00:27.180> what<00:00:27.300> I'll<00:00:27.420> be<00:00:27.540> talking<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:28.290> you<00:00:28.380> about

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
is what I'll be talking to you about

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.440 
is what I'll be talking to you about
today<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.700> underground<00:00:30.150> sprinkler

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:30.450 
today is the underground sprinkler

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.350 
today is the underground sprinkler
system<00:00:31.020> part<00:00:31.259> of<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.529> what<00:00:32.520> we<00:00:32.640> have<00:00:32.790> over<00:00:33.120> here

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
system part of it what we have over here

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.710 
system part of it what we have over here
is<00:00:33.620> just<00:00:34.620> your<00:00:34.829> basic<00:00:34.860> setup<00:00:35.600> typically<00:00:36.600> this

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
is just your basic setup typically this

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.210 
is just your basic setup typically this
would<00:00:36.899> be<00:00:36.960> underground<00:00:37.500> but<00:00:37.980> for

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
would be underground but for

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.620 
would be underground but for
demonstration<00:00:38.910> purposes

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:39.630 
demonstration purposes

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.510 
demonstration purposes
it'll<00:00:40.079> be<00:00:40.200> above-ground<00:00:40.710> today<00:00:43.250> what<00:00:44.250> we<00:00:44.340> have

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
it'll be above-ground today what we have

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.850 
it'll be above-ground today what we have
here<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.210> just<00:00:45.420> this<00:00:46.170> would<00:00:46.350> basically<00:00:46.469> be

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
here is just this would basically be

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.240 
here is just this would basically be
one's<00:00:47.280> own<00:00:47.580> zones<00:00:48.620> depends<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:49.740> the<00:00:49.830> size<00:00:50.100> of

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
one's own zones depends on the size of

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.730 
one's own zones depends on the size of
your<00:00:50.310> yard<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.940> your<00:00:51.030> water<00:00:51.240> pressure<00:00:51.740> but

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:52.740 
your yard and your water pressure but

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.620 
your yard and your water pressure but
depending<00:00:53.250> on<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.580> is<00:00:53.880> how<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.090> base<00:00:54.390> how

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.630 
depending on that is how you base how

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.230 
depending on that is how you base how
many<00:00:54.810> zones<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.320> have<00:00:55.670> right<00:00:56.670> here<00:00:56.880> like<00:00:57.090> I

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:57.240 
many zones you have right here like I

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.970 
many zones you have right here like I
said<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.630> just<00:00:57.660> one<00:00:58.050> zone<00:00:58.380> for<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.130> smaller<00:00:59.490> area

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
said is just one zone for a smaller area

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.130 
said is just one zone for a smaller area
zones<00:01:01.980> are<00:01:02.370> controlled<00:01:02.790> by<00:01:02.910> valves<00:01:03.600> for<00:01:03.870> every

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
zones are controlled by valves for every

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.380 
zones are controlled by valves for every
zone<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.500> have<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.949> have<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> valve<00:01:05.460> all

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
zone you have you have a valve all

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.620 
zone you have you have a valve all
explaining<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.990> valves<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.500> little<00:01:07.740> bit<00:01:07.890> later

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
explaining the valves a little bit later

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.929 
explaining the valves a little bit later
and<00:01:09.630> off<00:01:10.259> your<00:01:10.530> zones<00:01:10.829> you<00:01:11.070> also<00:01:11.250> determine

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
and off your zones you also determine

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.280 
and off your zones you also determine
the<00:01:12.060> size<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.450> your<00:01:12.509> zone<00:01:12.810> by<00:01:13.560> what<00:01:14.220> kind<00:01:14.460> of

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
the size of your zone by what kind of

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.330 
the size of your zone by what kind of
nozzles<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:17.090> spray<00:01:18.090> tips<00:01:18.360> you're<00:01:18.540> using

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
nozzles and spray tips you're using

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.219 
nozzles and spray tips you're using
zones<00:01:20.340> are<00:01:20.550> also<00:01:20.909> determined<00:01:21.510> by<00:01:21.570> your<00:01:21.840> double

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
zones are also determined by your double

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.370 
zones are also determined by your double
coverage<00:01:22.650> what<00:01:23.430> double<00:01:23.790> coverage<00:01:24.120> is<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.630> to

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
coverage what double coverage is is to

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.160 
coverage what double coverage is is to
get<00:01:25.560> all<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.920> grass<00:01:26.190> with<00:01:26.880> two<00:01:27.180> heads<00:01:27.479> arm

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
get all the grass with two heads arm

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.090 
get all the grass with two heads arm
right<00:01:28.650> here

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
right here

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.100 
right here
all<00:01:29.310> we<00:01:29.640> have<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:30.060> single<00:01:30.450> coverage<00:01:30.840> and

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
all we have is single coverage and

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.350 
all we have is single coverage and
that's<00:01:31.560> not<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.830> typical<00:01:32.190> situation<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:33.180> want

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
that's not a typical situation you want

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.620 
that's not a typical situation you want
to<00:01:33.450> have<00:01:33.890> your<00:01:34.890> main<00:01:35.070> components<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.820> system

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
to have your main components to a system

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.510 
to have your main components to a system
and<00:01:36.840> kind<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.140> how<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.409> works<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.010> start

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
and kind of how it works is you start

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.760 
and kind of how it works is you start
off<00:01:38.670> with<00:01:38.729> your<00:01:39.210> main<00:01:39.390> line<00:01:39.690> which<00:01:40.110> our<00:01:40.590> main

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
off with your main line which our main

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.340 
off with your main line which our main
line<00:01:41.010> is<00:01:41.310> right<00:01:41.700> here<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.120> that<00:01:42.720> runs<00:01:42.990> off

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
line is right here and that runs off

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.969 
line is right here and that runs off
your<00:01:43.790> actual<00:01:44.790> water<00:01:45.000> system<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.770> off<00:01:46.770> your

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
your actual water system and off your

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.730 
your actual water system and off your
main<00:01:47.159> line<00:01:47.460> are<00:01:47.940> your<00:01:48.299> valves<00:01:48.780> like<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.530> said

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
main line are your valves like I said

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.219 
main line are your valves like I said
for<00:01:49.920> every<00:01:50.130> zone<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.610> have<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.790> valve<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.990> if

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
for every zone you have a valve so if

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.690 
for every zone you have a valve so if
you<00:01:52.350> have<00:01:52.470> five<00:01:52.680> zones<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.220> will<00:01:53.310> have<00:01:53.430> five

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
you have five zones you will have five

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.310 
you have five zones you will have five
different<00:01:53.880> valves<00:01:54.479> running<00:01:54.750> off<00:01:54.900> your<00:01:55.140> main

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
different valves running off your main

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.070 
different valves running off your main
line<00:01:55.729> then<00:01:56.729> off<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.270> end<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.600> each<00:01:57.750> valve

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
line then off the end of each valve

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.160 
line then off the end of each valve
you'll<00:01:58.740> have<00:01:59.010> your<00:01:59.250> zone<00:01:59.549> line<00:01:59.869> what<00:02:00.869> we<00:02:00.990> have

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
you'll have your zone line what we have

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.359 
you'll have your zone line what we have
right<00:02:01.380> here<00:02:01.439> is<00:02:02.360> PVC<00:02:03.360> pipe<00:02:03.920> another<00:02:04.920> type<00:02:05.189> of

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
right here is PVC pipe another type of

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.929 
right here is PVC pipe another type of
pipe<00:02:05.549> many<00:02:05.850> people<00:02:06.240> use<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.810> called<00:02:07.170> poly<00:02:07.500> pipe

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
pipe many people use is called poly pipe

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.490 
pipe many people use is called poly pipe
it's<00:02:08.939> just<00:02:09.179> it's<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.569> lot<00:02:09.720> easier<00:02:09.959> more

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
it's just it's a lot easier more

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.949 
it's just it's a lot easier more
flexible<00:02:11.090> if<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.239> have<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.420> leak<00:02:12.659> or<00:02:12.840> anything

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
flexible if you have a leak or anything

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.199 
flexible if you have a leak or anything
like<00:02:13.319> that<00:02:13.379> they're<00:02:13.830> just<00:02:13.860> they're<00:02:14.700> they're

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
like that they're just they're they're

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.229 
like that they're just they're they're
more<00:02:15.390> easy<00:02:15.599> to<00:02:15.810> work<00:02:15.959> on<00:02:16.519> but<00:02:17.519> off<00:02:17.700> either<00:02:18.030> your

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
more easy to work on but off either your

set your clock off these it all depends

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.920 
set your clock off these it all depends
on<00:03:00.910> how<00:03:01.090> much<00:03:01.239> you<00:03:01.390> want<00:03:01.510> to<00:03:01.720> water

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
on how much you want to water

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
the hotter times of our season we're

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.370 
the hotter times of our season we're
typically<00:03:09.730> going<00:03:10.060> to<00:03:10.120> run<00:03:10.299> these<00:03:10.450> from<00:03:10.810> 20<00:03:11.349> to

different<00:03:16.209> places<00:03:16.660> also<00:03:16.870> matter<00:03:17.260> you<00:03:17.530> just

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
different places also matter you just

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.850 
different places also matter you just
kind<00:03:17.920> of<00:03:17.980> have<00:03:18.130> to<00:03:18.280> determine<00:03:18.579> that<00:03:19.049> as<00:03:20.049> you<00:03:20.650> go

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
kind of have to determine that as you go

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.699 
kind of have to determine that as you go
I<00:03:21.599> mean<00:03:22.599> if<00:03:22.690> your<00:03:22.840> grass<00:03:23.049> is<00:03:23.260> drying<00:03:23.530> up

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
I mean if your grass is drying up

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.380 
I mean if your grass is drying up
obviously<00:03:24.489> you<00:03:24.579> need<00:03:24.700> to<00:03:24.819> run<00:03:24.940> your<00:03:25.000> clock<00:03:25.360> a

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
obviously you need to run your clock a

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.979 
obviously you need to run your clock a
little<00:03:25.720> longer<00:03:25.959> and<00:03:26.230> water<00:03:26.650> more<00:03:27.780> based<00:03:28.780> off

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
little longer and water more based off

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.900 
little longer and water more based off
your<00:03:29.170> clock<00:03:29.500> you<00:03:29.709> can<00:03:29.920> control<00:03:30.310> many<00:03:30.579> things

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
your clock you can control many things

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.390 
your clock you can control many things
it's<00:03:31.209> just<00:03:31.420> an<00:03:31.540> electrical<00:03:32.049> clock<00:03:32.350> you<00:03:33.220> can

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
it's just an electrical clock you can

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.680 
it's just an electrical clock you can
set<00:03:33.609> the<00:03:33.730> times<00:03:34.000> you<00:03:34.209> want<00:03:34.329> to<00:03:34.480> water

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
set the times you want to water

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.949 
set the times you want to water
typically<00:03:35.380> you<00:03:35.590> want<00:03:35.769> to<00:03:35.889> water<00:03:36.150> late<00:03:37.150> late

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
typically you want to water late late

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.330 
typically you want to water late late
morning<00:03:40.500> this<00:03:41.500> is<00:03:41.709> just<00:03:41.920> due<00:03:42.069> to<00:03:42.100> the<00:03:42.310> fact

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
morning this is just due to the fact

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.849 
morning this is just due to the fact
that<00:03:42.730> helps<00:03:43.630> control<00:03:43.810> disease<00:03:44.380> and<00:03:44.650> water

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
that helps control disease and water

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.940 
that helps control disease and water
evaporation<00:03:45.549> and<00:03:45.970> such<00:03:46.180> things<00:03:46.510> like<00:03:46.630> that

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
evaporation and such things like that

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.940 
evaporation and such things like that
your<00:03:48.370> clock<00:03:48.639> can<00:03:48.850> also<00:03:49.030> set<00:03:49.540> how<00:03:50.470> many<00:03:50.530> days

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
your clock can also set how many days

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.559 
your clock can also set how many days
you<00:03:51.190> want<00:03:51.370> to<00:03:51.489> water<00:03:51.670> how<00:03:51.940> many<00:03:52.120> times<00:03:52.389> you

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
you want to water how many times you

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.559 
you want to water how many times you
want<00:03:52.750> to<00:03:52.840> water<00:03:53.459> you<00:03:54.459> basically<00:03:54.940> control<00:03:55.239> your

want to water you basically control your

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.229 
want to water you basically control your
whole<00:03:55.720> system<00:03:55.989> off<00:03:56.290> your<00:03:56.500> clock<00:03:56.850> how<00:03:57.850> you<00:03:57.910> want

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
whole system off your clock how you want

00:03:58.239 --> 00:03:59.580 
whole system off your clock how you want
to<00:03:58.359> run<00:03:58.510> it<00:03:58.660> and<00:03:58.780> how<00:03:58.930> you<00:03:58.989> want<00:03:59.260> to<00:03:59.350> set<00:03:59.560> up

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
to run it and how you want to set up

to run it and how you want to set up
your<00:03:59.739> watering<00:04:00.220> schedule<00:04:00.730> I'll<00:04:01.299> talk<00:04:01.510> to<00:04:01.540> you

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
your watering schedule I'll talk to you

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.660 
your watering schedule I'll talk to you
now<00:04:01.810> a<00:04:01.840> little<00:04:01.989> bit<00:04:02.290> about<00:04:02.500> heads<00:04:02.829> right<00:04:03.609> here

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
now a little bit about heads right here

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.309 
now a little bit about heads right here
is<00:04:04.120> just<00:04:04.230> a<00:04:05.230> spray<00:04:05.530> head<00:04:06.030> we<00:04:07.030> also<00:04:07.180> have<00:04:07.600> what

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
is just a spray head we also have what

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.589 
is just a spray head we also have what
we<00:04:08.440> call<00:04:08.650> a<00:04:08.680> rotor<00:04:09.010> head<00:04:09.310> the<00:04:09.940> rotor<00:04:10.150> head<00:04:10.389> is

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
we call a rotor head the rotor head is

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.289 
we call a rotor head the rotor head is
typically<00:04:10.989> used<00:04:11.260> for<00:04:11.440> bigger<00:04:11.739> areas<00:04:12.090> you<00:04:13.090> can

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
typically used for bigger areas you can

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.420 
typically used for bigger areas you can
put<00:04:14.109> your<00:04:14.260> heads<00:04:14.500> so<00:04:14.739> they<00:04:14.769> spray<00:04:15.130> a<00:04:15.160> lot

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
put your heads so they spray a lot

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.699 
put your heads so they spray a lot
further<00:04:15.670> these<00:04:16.419> are<00:04:16.660> for<00:04:16.840> a<00:04:16.870> smaller<00:04:17.260> area

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
further these are for a smaller area

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.479 
further these are for a smaller area
type<00:04:17.979> situations<00:04:19.289> we<00:04:20.289> also<00:04:20.440> have<00:04:20.799> micro

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
type situations we also have micro

nozzle<00:05:14.360> and<00:05:14.510> this<00:05:14.960> is<00:05:15.140> so<00:05:15.290> you<00:05:15.350> keep<00:05:15.650> your

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
nozzle and this is so you keep your

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
put on your heads they're all different

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.840 
put on your heads they're all different
gallon<00:05:23.270> per<00:05:23.450> minutes<00:05:23.810> and<00:05:24.020> like<00:05:24.440> I<00:05:24.590> said<00:05:24.850> the

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
gallon per minutes and like I said the

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
don't want them high enough so when you
