00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:07.429
 hello everyone this is the second lesson 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:10.740
 for the resolution of the rubik cube 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:14.219
 facilitated last time we saw 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.009
 as positioned this 4 cubes on the 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.339
 facade of the central white forming 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:24.660
 this cross this lesson instead 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:28.169
 we will see how to position the corners of 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.230
 four white corners so that 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:34.590
 be all settled 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.629
 keeping in mind that it will not be enough 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.239
 place a white chimar cube 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:42.030
 he must also have these two equal sides 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:46.850
 to the adjacent colors so when he was a 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.850
 orange blue white cube 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.239
 let's go with the resolution because everything 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.340
 is focused on extreme ease 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.059
 instead of, for example, thinking that 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.469
 here it goes from the cube that is red white 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.110
 green 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.450
 let's do a simpler thing 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.540
 we identify the cubes that have a side 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:14.280
 white and that initially they have it 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.930
 on the top and not below 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.710
 so here's a first cover but 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.420
 I positioned myself at the front to us at an angle 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.600
 and see how to take it to the part 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.600
 higher 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.820
 clearly we will have this cube 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.000
 position in such a way that the colors 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.710
 adjacent to the white in this case if the 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.470
 white now let's look at the color 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.270
 adjacent on our left both 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.460
 positioned in the same facade that 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.960
 have the central color of the same 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:49.410
 color then we will turn the part 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.210
 above the two layers until 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.330
 this blog does not consider with blue 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:58.530
 central here is done so we have the 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.000
 frontal white is different if it is the 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.650
 our right our left 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.400
 the important thing is that it recently colors a 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:08.330
 white is placed in the same 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:14.990
 on the same side of the same color 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:17.910
 now how to go about it when 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:21.600
 we have the right color we must 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.950
 position it at this point so not 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.590
 let's do nothing but vote this way 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.500
 then we point out a cave up to 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.920
 bring it more frontally with white 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.640
 we carry our left over ed 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.640
 done 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.320
 the white went to the right place in the 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.620
 towards the right because of the blues 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:46.830
 in the same place as its colors 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.590
 adjacent and red next to color 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:53.489
 red we find another white here it is 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:57.930
 here it must not be under white but 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:03:02.370
 in 12 two sides we now have to find the 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.880
 green color that is in the same 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.890
 facade 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.590
 that's it, so we have the color 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:11.610
 green white with green place it 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:14.790
 here to place it up here 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:18.660
 in fact it is white red green white 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.700
 red green this time to the left it 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.310
 let's move from this side here then 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.489
 we rotate in this way so that white 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:30.030
 it was always our sight if we had 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:35.150
 done in this way the white would be 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:38.190
 disappeared from our view you see 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.380
 so correctly to use it is 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.390
 always that of the facade 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:53.790
 that's it, so from here it's passed here 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:57.290
 now we report it in this way is enough 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.290
 found we report it above 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.190
 and here also this other white one is made 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.280
 position we immediately found a 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.959
 other white we are lucky 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.180
 we must find the license with the 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.940
 orange color 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.980
 come on here is done throwing an orange 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.850
 we have the same discourse as the first ones 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.280
 left we vote this way then it 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.780
 we vote 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.380
 so that the white pass from left to 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:30.120
 right we report it above and we have 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:33.630
 also found this other cubes there 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:36.180
 there remains only one that we are going to see 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.479
 where it is here it happened for example 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.130
 which I was hoping to see as when the 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:44.550
 white is positioned below instead 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:48.870
 frontally on one of the two sides like 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:53.940
 let's place it on its side 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:57.590
 simply then we bring in to below 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:02.370
 the place where it should go 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:05.610
 we turn this way then we do it 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:10.169
 stay here and yet another location 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:12.780
 we report on the two whites and we have 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.800
 one white that is no longer on the facade 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.970
 below 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:20.220
 but it is on one of the two sides 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.380
 we bring it back to the right position 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.979
 then orange an orange 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.900
 then we make our passage that 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:31.710
 we learned then we really bring 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:37.599
 here we report it here 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:41.710
 and we report it above here we have 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:44.590
 solved this was shown and as you see 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:49.319
 it is not just the facade that is all 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:52.409
 white but also lateral colors 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:56.169
 has placed them 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:59.259
 the second lesson is over we will meet again 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:03.750
 to the next with the resolution e 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:03.750
 second layer hello everyone
