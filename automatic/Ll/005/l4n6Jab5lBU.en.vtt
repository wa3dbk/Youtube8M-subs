00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:06.190
 hello youtube people as they are waiting 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:08.170
 that the soles friend chet and well then 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.840
 now with a new video this time I'm going 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.300
 to teach how to open the ship of your xbox one 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.460
 or playstation 4 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.860
 to open ports or whatever they want to say 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.869
 the joke is that I'm going to try to 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.930
 teach it in the simplest way that 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.640
 be able to do it fast and then 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.790
 it's not the same to open the ports 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.590
 for the 360 ​​that for the xbox one or for 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.930
 the playstation 3 that for play 4 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.840
 because the new consoles are asking you 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.600
 more ports for example before I think that 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.270
 for the present and play 3 were 5 or 4 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.600
 ports and now there are eight ports 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.699
 so then it's enough and we're going to 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.980
 start in this case is for those who are 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.530
 Telmex customers 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.809
 for those who have another company and another 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.210
 kind of fashion they have to check it in 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.790
 google and then it's the same in terms of 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.040
 configure the ports that does not have to 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.230
 see below those of telmex I will leave you 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.180
 the link to enter the menu of the 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.979
 modem and well here I already have it 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.130
 saved in favorites in the bar 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.630
 google chrome markers we enter and 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.550
 good at first they will ask for the 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.470
 user since he will always be telmex in 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.420
 uppercase and the password is going to be the 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.180
 password that you have in the 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.220
 modem in the back and well this 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.320
 already with the sun they give him initiate if I 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.370
 I gave in remember for several reasons and 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.380
 good 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:31.220
 we wait for him to load once inside 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:33.230
 by the way is for the model 532 hg 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.030
 It may vary in some options but 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.040
 basically it's the same thing we're going to 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.340
 advanced and have to look for a 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.760
 section that are called nat once 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.740
 being in nat we go to the section that 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.330
 says port activation or forward 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.980
 porting depends if your modem is in 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.780
 English, it would be that 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.810
 and then they go now to start 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.150
 configure the ports you have to give 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.460
 here in new they will appear a 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.470
 line of blue color is because also 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.350
 nothing is set then they're going to 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.120
 give type customization in interface you 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.520
 they are going to select internet is the only 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.460
 what's in the activation protocol going to 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:15.090
 be tcp who cited vp that in this case 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.970
 is both and for the first port we are going to 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:24.360
 write the one that I have this as name 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:28.800
 one is going to be 30 74 to 30 75 equal to 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:32.940
 low 30 74 down 30 75 and it's going to put you 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.710
 name 1 and they will give you in save when 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.600
 Do this, it will seem like the one 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.090
 I have up here 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.970
 once having done that they will 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:46.290
 to give again in new will resist 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:48.270
 again all the menu here and we're going to 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.600
 open the second port in this case is 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:56.190
 the 53 there if they are going to put all like 53 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.320
 53 53 name now it's going to be 2 and you're going 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.330
 to give in save if they fix the first 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.990
 was the only one that encompasses a range of 1 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.660
 in this case 30 74 30 to 30 and 75 the 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.970
 others are equal to this one you can go 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.980
 which is a little easier to erase 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:16.100
 This is because I already have it the same 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:21.620
 then they carry 81 then put 81 81 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.620
 81 81 81 81 23 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:28.470
 3 and they give in keeping him back to 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:34.610
 select in new it is erased again 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.610
 everything now we open the port 88 88 88 88 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:42.980
 name let's put them on 4 I think they have 4 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.560
 and so they are putting name 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:49.730
 7 to 8 will then open the 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.440
 ports 30 74 to 30 75 the following 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:57.830
 ports are always going to be the same in this 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:04:04.220
 case 53 53 50 and 53 then 81 81 81 81 88 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:07.010
 88 88 the 4,500 4,500 4500 4500 when 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.870
 I repeat those numbers is because it is porte 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.820
 Initial activation of the final port of 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.710
 opening port initial activation 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.990
 open end in this case they are always going to 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:20.030
 put them the only one that changes is 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:23.390
 that of 30 74 ends at 30 75 equal to 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:26.570
 who starts the open port 30 74 30 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:29.150
 75 the others as I comment them look are 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.160
 exactly does not change anything just in 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.610
 this case changes the name and I come back 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.680
 once activated all the ports of 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.060
 preference disconnects in the xbox one from 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.010
 the current 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.340
 reset that is by pressing the button 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:46.280
 of ignition until it extinguishes forgiveness 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.570
 completely and off for 30 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.669
 seconds which is what it takes in 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.260
 establish connection with the server 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.270
 telmex for in this case the one that 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.030
 provides the internet could turn on the 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.710
 modem turn on the xbox one and now if 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.260
 he has them that can be kind of cream 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.240
 Open I hope you liked it if you have 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.430
 some doubt do not forget to leave it in the 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.770
 comments so he can 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.770
 lend a hand in what you can 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:12.889
 and we were seeing each other until the person
