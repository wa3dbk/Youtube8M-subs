never<00:01:45.259> got<00:01:45.619> network<00:01:46.430> notes<00:01:46.909> we<00:01:47.420> were<00:01:47.539> kind<00:01:47.810> of

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
never got network notes we were kind of

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.749 
never got network notes we were kind of
I<00:01:48.229> mean<00:01:48.560> I<00:01:48.680> think<00:01:48.710> that's<00:01:49.070> what<00:01:49.220> made<00:01:49.430> a<00:01:49.460> really

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
I mean I think that's what made a really

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.120 
I mean I think that's what made a really
work<00:01:50.119> as<00:01:50.330> we<00:01:50.479> really<00:01:50.810> actually<00:01:51.229> did<00:01:51.799> exactly

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
work as we really actually did exactly

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.710 
work as we really actually did exactly
what<00:01:52.399> we<00:01:52.549> wanted<00:01:53.119> and<00:01:53.360> so<00:01:54.020> what<00:01:54.500> you<00:01:54.649> saw<00:01:55.009> was

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
what we wanted and so what you saw was

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.200 
what we wanted and so what you saw was
while<00:01:56.720> we<00:01:56.899> were<00:01:57.080> there<00:01:57.110> at<00:01:57.830> least<00:01:58.090> what<00:01:59.090> you

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
while we were there at least what you

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.210 
while we were there at least what you
saw<00:01:59.450> was<00:01:59.479> kind<00:01:59.960> of<00:02:00.020> what<00:02:00.170> you<00:02:00.200> got<00:02:00.500> and<00:02:00.830> it<00:02:01.039> was

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
saw was kind of what you got and it was

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.309 
saw was kind of what you got and it was
exactly<00:02:01.610> what<00:02:01.940> we<00:02:02.060> wanted<00:02:02.360> to<00:02:02.479> be<00:02:02.600> doing<00:02:02.899> the

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:03.319 
exactly what we wanted to be doing the

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:06.490 
exactly what we wanted to be doing the
only<00:02:03.590> network<00:02:03.800> note<00:02:04.190> we<00:02:04.429> ever<00:02:04.640> got<00:02:04.880> was<00:02:05.500> the

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
only network note we ever got was the

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.650 
only network note we ever got was the
they<00:02:06.950> couldn't<00:02:07.399> during<00:02:07.850> black<00:02:08.030> away<00:02:08.269> movies

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
they couldn't during black away movies

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.449 
they couldn't during black away movies
they<00:02:08.810> said<00:02:09.050> we<00:02:09.170> can't<00:02:09.470> see<00:02:09.709> the<00:02:09.890> silhouettes

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
they said we can't see the silhouettes

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:11.920 
they said we can't see the silhouettes
so<00:02:10.700> you<00:02:10.759> have<00:02:11.000> to<00:02:11.150> make<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:11.450> silhouettes<00:02:11.930> of

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
so you have to make the silhouettes of

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.170 
so you have to make the silhouettes of
different<00:02:12.440> color<00:02:12.680> so<00:02:13.580> there's<00:02:13.760> like<00:02:13.940> two

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
different color so there's like two

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.570 
different color so there's like two
shows<00:02:14.510> or<00:02:14.840> wait<00:02:14.989> like<00:02:15.230> greens<00:02:15.590> silhouettes

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
shows or wait like greens silhouettes

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.420 
shows or wait like greens silhouettes
and<00:02:16.940> then<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:18.560> guy<00:02:18.709> was<00:02:18.920> doing<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.250> editing

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
and then the guy was doing the editing

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.610 
and then the guy was doing the editing
for<00:02:20.000> us<00:02:20.150> said<00:02:20.420> oh<00:02:20.600> there's<00:02:20.930> a<00:02:21.049> way<00:02:21.230> around<00:02:21.350> that

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
for us said oh there's a way around that

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.500 
for us said oh there's a way around that
you<00:02:21.769> just<00:02:21.980> blew<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.519> black<00:02:22.730> and<00:02:22.940> white<00:02:23.090> image

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
you just blew the black and white image

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.690 
you just blew the black and white image
and<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:24.319> silhouettes<00:02:24.769> pops<00:02:25.040> so<00:02:25.340> that<00:02:25.459> was<00:02:25.610> the

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
and the silhouettes pops so that was the

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.440 
and the silhouettes pops so that was the
only<00:02:25.880> know<00:02:26.180> we<00:02:26.390> ever<00:02:26.600> got<00:02:26.750> and<00:02:27.170> so<00:02:28.299> part<00:02:29.299> of

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
only know we ever got and so part of

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.390 
only know we ever got and so part of
coming<00:02:30.049> back<00:02:30.200> to<00:02:30.470> it<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:30.650> doing<00:02:30.860> cinematic

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
coming back to it and doing cinematic

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.520 
coming back to it and doing cinematic
titanic<00:02:31.519> again<00:02:32.299> was<00:02:32.510> that<00:02:32.690> same<00:02:32.930> thing<00:02:33.320> where

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
titanic again was that same thing where

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.640 
titanic again was that same thing where
suddenly<00:02:33.980> you<00:02:34.640> can<00:02:34.880> fund<00:02:35.329> a<00:02:35.480> project<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:36.350> put

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
suddenly you can fund a project and put

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.759 
suddenly you can fund a project and put
it<00:02:36.739> online<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:38.000> sell<00:02:38.540> finance<00:02:39.019> a<00:02:39.140> project<00:02:39.170> and
