sort of contributed to it but it was

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.010 
sort of contributed to it but it was
there<00:01:33.280> before<00:01:33.520> the<00:01:33.729> Macintosh<00:01:34.390> because<00:01:34.810> it's

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
there before the Macintosh because it's

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.889
