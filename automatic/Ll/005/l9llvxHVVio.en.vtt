their production life and so many of

their stress they're tired and what we
think<00:00:25.830> happened<00:00:25.890> is<00:00:26.310> after<00:00:26.490> we<00:00:26.760> inspected

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
think happened is after we inspected

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.419 
think happened is after we inspected
them<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.689> found<00:00:27.900> them<00:00:28.080> acceptable<00:00:28.650> some<00:00:29.310> of

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
them just uh either they're obstinate or

they're tired they just went down but

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.530 
they're tired they just went down but
the<00:00:34.620> plant<00:00:34.920> has<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.579> notify<00:00:35.730> us<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.510> we

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
the plant has to notify us so that we

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.660 
the plant has to notify us so that we
can<00:00:36.899> re-examine<00:00:37.200> them<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.890> decide<00:00:38.520> if

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
can re-examine them and decide if

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.950 
can re-examine them and decide if
they're<00:00:38.820> acceptable<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.420> go<00:00:39.510> into<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.780> food

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
they're acceptable to go into the food

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:48.650 
they're acceptable to go into the food
supply<00:00:46.489> this<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.670> really<00:00:47.940> an<00:00:48.180> inhumane

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
supply this is really an inhumane

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
supply this is really an inhumane
handling<00:00:49.230> issue<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:51.230> because<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.260> looked<00:00:52.559> at

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
handling issue and because I looked at

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.560 
handling issue and because I looked at
these<00:00:52.770> animals<00:00:53.250> initially<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:53.940> found<00:00:54.449> them

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
these animals initially and found them

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.639 
these animals initially and found them
acceptable<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.469> then<00:00:55.980> shortly<00:00:56.610> thereafter

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
acceptable and then shortly thereafter

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.740 
acceptable and then shortly thereafter
they<00:00:58.649> went<00:00:58.920> down<00:00:59.219> we<00:01:00.059> don't<00:01:00.180> have<00:01:00.390> really

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
they went down we don't have really

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.450 
they went down we don't have really
reason<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.199> believe<00:01:01.350> this<00:01:01.649> product<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.219> really

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
reason to believe this product is really

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.990 
reason to believe this product is really
unsafe<00:01:03.890> but<00:01:04.890> we<00:01:05.040> think<00:01:05.220> it's<00:01:05.430> important<00:01:05.939> to

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
unsafe but we think it's important to

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.580 
unsafe but we think it's important to
tell<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.420> public<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:06.930> what<00:01:07.200> happened

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
tell the public this is what happened

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.980 
tell the public this is what happened
it's<00:01:08.130> not<00:01:08.369> acceptable<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.570> this<00:01:09.780> is

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
it's not acceptable and so this is

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.960 
it's not acceptable and so this is
product<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.500> we<00:01:10.590> do<00:01:10.799> need<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.250> recall<00:01:11.670> it's

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
product that we do need to recall it's

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.359 
product that we do need to recall it's
what<00:01:12.119> we<00:01:12.240> call<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.450> class<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.170> recall<00:01:13.590> which<00:01:14.130> is

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
what we call a class to recall which is

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.789 
what we call a class to recall which is
a<00:01:14.400> remote<00:01:15.210> probability<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:16.140> any<00:01:16.320> adverse

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
a remote probability of any adverse

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:26.350 
a remote probability of any adverse
health<00:01:16.830> consequences

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.180 

it's<00:01:26.540> about<00:01:26.630> 900<00:01:27.290> plants<00:01:27.680> at<00:01:27.800> slaughter

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
it's about 900 plants at slaughter

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.250 
it's about 900 plants at slaughter
livestock<00:01:29.090> that<00:01:29.270> slaughtered<00:01:29.600> livestock<00:01:29.750> of

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
livestock that slaughtered livestock of

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.310 
livestock that slaughtered livestock of
one<00:01:30.740> nature<00:01:31.070> or<00:01:31.220> another<00:01:31.460> they<00:01:32.320> understand

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
one nature or another they understand

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.020 
one nature or another they understand
humane<00:01:33.620> handling<00:01:33.650> they<00:01:34.250> take<00:01:34.520> it<00:01:34.640> seriously

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
humane handling they take it seriously

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.430 
humane handling they take it seriously
and<00:01:35.210> they<00:01:35.300> make<00:01:35.450> sure<00:01:35.630> their<00:01:35.780> employees<00:01:36.230> take

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
and they make sure their employees take

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.380 
and they make sure their employees take
it<00:01:36.560> seriously<00:01:36.980> and<00:01:37.190> we<00:01:37.700> look<00:01:37.970> at<00:01:38.090> what<00:01:38.240> they're

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
it seriously and we look at what they're

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.110 
it seriously and we look at what they're
doing<00:01:38.720> every<00:01:39.020> day<00:01:39.170> on<00:01:40.100> humane<00:01:40.520> handling<00:01:40.550> and

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
doing every day on humane handling and

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.210 
doing every day on humane handling and
so<00:01:41.510> part<00:01:41.780> of<00:01:41.840> this<00:01:41.930> investigation<00:01:42.260> is<00:01:43.010> to

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
so part of this investigation is to

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.540 
so part of this investigation is to
figure<00:01:43.430> out<00:01:43.729> how<00:01:44.479> to<00:01:44.540> dis<00:01:44.780> occur<00:01:45.290> who<00:01:46.070> knew<00:01:46.310> or

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
figure out how to dis occur who knew or

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.120 
figure out how to dis occur who knew or
didn't<00:01:46.850> know<00:01:46.880> and<00:01:47.740> that's<00:01:48.740> how<00:01:48.920> we're<00:01:49.040> going

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
didn't know and that's how we're going

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.380 
didn't know and that's how we're going
to<00:01:49.190> get<00:01:49.340> to<00:01:49.460> the<00:01:49.550> bottom<00:01:49.580> of<00:01:50.030> what<00:01:50.240> we<00:01:50.360> think

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
to get to the bottom of what we think

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.180 
to get to the bottom of what we think
occurred<00:01:50.900> so<00:01:51.110> I<00:01:51.140> do<00:01:51.229> not<00:01:51.380> think<00:01:51.530> it's<00:01:51.890> it's

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
occurred so I do not think it's it's

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.460 
occurred so I do not think it's it's
commonplace<00:01:52.610> again<00:01:53.450> there's<00:01:53.660> no<00:01:53.720> reason<00:01:54.229> for

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
commonplace again there's no reason for

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.890 
commonplace again there's no reason for
it<00:01:54.500> this<00:01:55.070> is<00:01:55.310> an<00:01:55.460> isolated<00:01:55.630> situation<00:01:56.630> but<00:01:56.780> we

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
it this is an isolated situation but we

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.540 
it this is an isolated situation but we
do<00:01:57.080> think<00:01:57.110> it's<00:01:57.470> obviously<00:01:57.830> a<00:01:57.890> very<00:01:58.100> serious

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
do think it's obviously a very serious

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.700 
do think it's obviously a very serious
situation
