this<00:00:00.780> is<00:00:00.989> AJ<00:00:01.560> here<00:00:01.770> again<00:00:02.149> second<00:00:03.149> of<00:00:03.380> three

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
this is AJ here again second of three

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.820 
this is AJ here again second of three
videos<00:00:04.740> with<00:00:05.400> the<00:00:05.790> new<00:00:06.540> Arduino<00:00:07.230> starter<00:00:07.290> kit

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
videos with the new Arduino starter kit

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.339 
videos with the new Arduino starter kit
I<00:00:08.040> went<00:00:08.639> through<00:00:08.880> and<00:00:09.210> picked<00:00:09.690> out<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.809> project

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
I went through and picked out a project

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.200 
I went through and picked out a project
and<00:00:10.500> I'm<00:00:10.559> going<00:00:10.800> to<00:00:10.889> do<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.309> color<00:00:11.730> mixing

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
and I'm going to do the color mixing

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.390 
and I'm going to do the color mixing
lamp<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.990> basic<00:00:13.290> idea<00:00:13.590> is<00:00:13.679> you<00:00:13.920> have<00:00:14.160> an

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
lamp and the basic idea is you have an

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.220 
lamp and the basic idea is you have an
RGB<00:00:14.549> LED<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.450> three<00:00:16.670> photo<00:00:17.670> sensors<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.390> you

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
RGB LED and three photo sensors and you

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.170 
RGB LED and three photo sensors and you
go<00:00:19.380> through<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.710> as<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:19.920> vary<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.520> amount<00:00:21.029> of

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
go through and as you vary the amount of

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.380 
go through and as you vary the amount of
light<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:22.470> RGB<00:00:22.890> LED<00:00:23.369> will<00:00:23.609> change<00:00:24.090> depending

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
light the RGB LED will change depending

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.349 
light the RGB LED will change depending
on<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:25.019> so<00:00:25.460> I'm<00:00:26.460> going<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.640> go<00:00:26.789> through<00:00:27.090> and

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
on that so I'm going to go through and

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.460 
on that so I'm going to go through and
put<00:00:27.960> this<00:00:28.109> together<00:00:29.179> right<00:00:30.179> now<00:00:30.330> so<00:00:31.230> I'm<00:00:31.439> just

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
put this together right now so I'm just

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.630 
put this together right now so I'm just
got<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.130> book<00:00:32.279> here

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
got the book here

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.290 
got the book here
I<00:00:32.669> had<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.940> prop<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.480> open<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.809> little<00:00:33.930> bit<00:00:34.050> and

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
I had to prop it open a little bit and

00:00:35.300 --> 00:01:25.360 
I had to prop it open a little bit and
let's<00:00:36.300> get<00:00:36.540> started

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:02:12.980 

you

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:43.540 

you

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.789 

you

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.860 

all<00:02:51.799> right<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.420> circuits<00:02:53.420> all<00:02:53.540> put<00:02:53.749> together

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
all right the circuits all put together

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.369 
all right the circuits all put together
I<00:02:54.319> have<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.159> code<00:02:55.480> already<00:02:56.480> typed<00:02:56.930> out<00:02:57.109> on<00:02:57.290> my

00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:57.379 
I have the code already typed out on my

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:01.809 
I have the code already typed out on my
computer<00:02:58.090> let's<00:02:59.090> go<00:02:59.239> ahead<00:02:59.389> and<00:03:00.489> upload<00:03:01.489> it<00:03:01.609> to

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
computer let's go ahead and upload it to

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:15.030 
computer let's go ahead and upload it to
the<00:03:02.000> board<00:03:10.540> okay<00:03:11.540> it's<00:03:11.719> uploading<00:03:12.169> right<00:03:12.200> now

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.690 

all<00:03:16.040> right<00:03:16.099> and<00:03:16.489> as<00:03:16.849> you<00:03:16.969> can<00:03:17.120> see<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:18.340> LED<00:03:19.340> is

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
all right and as you can see the LED is

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.759 
all right and as you can see the LED is
a<00:03:19.730> little<00:03:20.480> it's<00:03:20.810> white<00:03:21.079> with<00:03:21.290> a<00:03:21.349> little<00:03:21.620> bit<00:03:21.739> of

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
a little it's white with a little bit of

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:27.610 
a little it's white with a little bit of
blue<00:03:22.069> in<00:03:22.310> it<00:03:22.459> and<00:03:23.980> as<00:03:24.980> you<00:03:25.099> can<00:03:25.219> see<00:03:25.400> as<00:03:25.549> I<00:03:26.620> cover

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
blue in it and as you can see as I cover

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.379 
blue in it and as you can see as I cover
up<00:03:28.480> different<00:03:30.010> gels<00:03:31.010> we<00:03:31.939> get<00:03:32.060> different

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:32.389 
up different gels we get different

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:39.099 
up different gels we get different
colors<00:03:32.750> here<00:03:37.359> took<00:03:38.359> the<00:03:38.480> blue<00:03:38.689> one<00:03:38.870> all<00:03:39.019> the

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109 
colors here took the blue one all the

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:50.530 
colors here took the blue one all the
way<00:03:39.230> off

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.210 

and<00:03:51.170> I<00:03:51.319> could<00:03:51.500> play<00:03:51.650> around<00:03:51.830> with<00:03:51.950> a<00:03:52.099> little

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
and I could play around with a little

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.259 
and I could play around with a little
bit<00:03:52.310> more<00:03:52.549> if<00:03:52.790> I<00:03:52.909> turned<00:03:53.269> off<00:03:53.480> the<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:55.700> ambient

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
bit more if I turned off the the ambient

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.050 
bit more if I turned off the the ambient
lighting<00:03:56.480> in<00:03:56.720> here<00:03:56.930> I<00:03:56.959> could<00:03:57.290> shine<00:03:57.590> an<00:03:58.159> LED

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
lighting in here I could shine an LED

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.699 
lighting in here I could shine an LED
flashlight<00:03:59.329> or<00:03:59.810> different<00:04:00.200> things<00:04:00.349> with

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
flashlight or different things with

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.770 
flashlight or different things with
other<00:04:01.549> color<00:04:01.819> temperatures<00:04:02.299> on<00:04:02.420> here<00:04:02.599> but

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
other color temperatures on here but

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.339 
other color temperatures on here but
really<00:04:03.140> quick<00:04:03.560> project<00:04:04.360> went<00:04:05.360> together<00:04:05.480> super

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
really quick project went together super

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.699 
really quick project went together super
easy<00:04:06.650> code<00:04:07.579> is<00:04:07.819> laid<00:04:08.810> out<00:04:08.840> in<00:04:09.110> the<00:04:09.200> book<00:04:09.379> really

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
easy code is laid out in the book really

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.979 
easy code is laid out in the book really
well<00:04:11.500> see<00:04:12.500> I<00:04:12.799> just<00:04:13.370> designed<00:04:13.549> a<00:04:13.879> base<00:04:14.060> on<00:04:14.360> the

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
well see I just designed a base on the

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:16.960 
well see I just designed a base on the
circuit<00:04:15.950> there<00:04:16.100> and<00:04:16.220> it<00:04:16.310> explains<00:04:16.820> what

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
circuit there and it explains what

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.490 
circuit there and it explains what
everything<00:04:17.359> does<00:04:17.389> here<00:04:17.900> and<00:04:18.049> how<00:04:18.139> to<00:04:18.199> put<00:04:18.410> it

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
everything does here and how to put it

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.949 
everything does here and how to put it
together<00:04:19.120> gives<00:04:20.120> you<00:04:20.180> a<00:04:20.209> little<00:04:20.329> overview<00:04:20.720> of

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
together gives you a little overview of

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.340 
together gives you a little overview of
the<00:04:21.250> project<00:04:22.630> all<00:04:23.630> the<00:04:23.780> code<00:04:23.990> here<00:04:24.199> and<00:04:24.260> it

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
the project all the code here and it

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.540 
the project all the code here and it
says<00:04:24.470> what<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:24.650> code<00:04:24.830> does<00:04:24.860> which<00:04:25.220> is<00:04:25.340> really

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
says what the code does which is really

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.350 
says what the code does which is really
important<00:04:25.970> too

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
important too

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.670 
important too
so<00:04:26.630> you're<00:04:26.750> not<00:04:26.810> just<00:04:26.870> typing<00:04:27.260> things<00:04:27.500> in

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
so you're not just typing things in

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.420 
so you're not just typing things in
without<00:04:28.010> understanding<00:04:30.010> yeah<00:04:31.010> and<00:04:31.280> it

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
without understanding yeah and it

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.219 
without understanding yeah and it
explains<00:04:31.729> how<00:04:31.880> to<00:04:31.940> use<00:04:32.120> it<00:04:32.330> and<00:04:32.479> a<00:04:32.720> little<00:04:33.080> bit

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
explains how to use it and a little bit

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:36.250 
explains how to use it and a little bit
of<00:04:33.380> additional<00:04:34.039> information<00:04:35.020> at<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.110> end

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
of additional information at the end

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.470 
of additional information at the end
there
