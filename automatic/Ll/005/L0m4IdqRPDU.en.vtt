00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
low-cost climbing rope storage bag there

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.580 
low-cost climbing rope storage bag there
isn't<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.800> lot<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:54.110> inside<00:00:55.579> you<00:00:56.579> have<00:00:56.789> this

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
isn't a lot to it inside you have this

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.779 
isn't a lot to it inside you have this
tarpaulin<00:00:58.590> here<00:00:58.920> which<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.489> can<00:00:59.640> actually

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
tarpaulin here which you can actually

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.540 
tarpaulin here which you can actually
splay<00:01:00.449> out<00:01:00.480> over<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.530> ground<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.219> if<00:01:02.340> the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
splay out over the ground so if the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.910 
splay out over the ground so if the
ground<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.000> wet<00:01:03.239> or<00:01:03.480> there's<00:01:03.719> jus<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.830> know

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
ground is wet or there's jus you know

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.289 
ground is wet or there's jus you know
your<00:01:05.100> rope<00:01:05.280> can<00:01:05.489> be<00:01:05.580> protected<00:01:06.090> from<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
your rope can be protected from the

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.030 
your rope can be protected from the
elements<00:01:06.450> as<00:01:06.930> well<00:01:07.170> as<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.439> other<00:01:07.560> climbing

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
elements as well as the other climbing

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.060 
elements as well as the other climbing
gear<00:01:08.220> as<00:01:08.400> well<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.990> also<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.200> tarpaulin<00:01:10.619> on

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
gear as well and also the tarpaulin on

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.230 
gear as well and also the tarpaulin on
each<00:01:11.640> corner<00:01:12.560> you<00:01:13.560> have<00:01:13.770> these<00:01:13.979> webbing<00:01:14.850> tags

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
each corner you have these webbing tags

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.120 
each corner you have these webbing tags
here<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.930> idea<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.710> can<00:01:16.860> just

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
here and the idea is that you can just

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.270 
here and the idea is that you can just
tie<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.150> end<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.630> your<00:01:18.750> rope<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.170> one<00:01:19.710> tag<00:01:19.979> in

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
tie the end of your rope to one tag in

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.490 
tie the end of your rope to one tag in
one<00:01:20.549> corner<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.150> other<00:01:21.810> end<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.049> your<00:01:22.200> rope<00:01:22.350> to

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
one corner the other end of your rope to

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.230 
one corner the other end of your rope to
the<00:01:22.619> other<00:01:22.799> corner<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.400> then<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.210> just

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
the other corner and then that just

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.630 
the other corner and then that just
avoids<00:01:24.900> any<00:01:25.049> kind<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.320> tangling<00:01:25.830> issues<00:01:28.640> that

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
avoids any kind of tangling issues that

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.179 
avoids any kind of tangling issues that
is<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.210> DMM<00:01:30.869> picture<00:01:33.590> so<00:01:34.590> we'll<00:01:34.740> move<00:01:34.860> over<00:01:35.040> to

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
is the DMM picture so we'll move over to

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.580 
is the DMM picture so we'll move over to
the<00:01:35.280> classic<00:01:37.729> so<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:39.360> classic<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.900> kind<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.530> an

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
the classic so the classic is kind of an

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.260 
the classic so the classic is kind of an
upgrade<00:01:40.710> hence<00:01:41.610> why<00:01:41.790> it's<00:01:41.909> more<00:01:42.060> expensive

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
upgrade hence why it's more expensive

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.670 
upgrade hence why it's more expensive
the<00:01:42.780> picture<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.409> can<00:01:43.590> get<00:01:43.770> for<00:01:43.979> about<00:01:44.299> 22

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
the picture you can get for about 22

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.370 
the picture you can get for about 22
pounds<00:01:46.680> $35<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:48.180> classic<00:01:48.750> we're<00:01:49.079> looking

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
pounds $35 and the classic we're looking

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.030 
pounds $35 and the classic we're looking
at<00:01:49.470> about<00:01:49.710> 35<00:01:50.340> pounds<00:01:50.820> $40<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:52.350> there's<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.890> few

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
at about 35 pounds $40 so there's a few

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.649 
at about 35 pounds $40 so there's a few
extra<00:01:53.159> features<00:01:53.700> here<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.180> this<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.450> front

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
extra features here so this is the front

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.230 
extra features here so this is the front
of<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.930> bag<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.500> you've<00:01:56.070> got<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.640> couple<00:01:57.060> of

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
of the bag and you've got a couple of

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.929 
of the bag and you've got a couple of
buckles<00:01:57.570> here<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.140> this<00:01:59.100> just<00:01:59.369> helps<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.759> bag

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
buckles here and this just helps the bag

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.490 
buckles here and this just helps the bag
stop<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:00.930> from<00:02:01.020> bulging<00:02:01.649> keep<00:02:01.890> in<00:02:02.100> shape

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.280 

and<00:02:04.740> then<00:02:05.190> you've<00:02:05.370> got<00:02:05.400> a<00:02:05.910> zip<00:02:06.480> closure<00:02:06.780> system

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
and then you've got a zip closure system

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.060 
and then you've got a zip closure system
here<00:02:08.570> so<00:02:09.570> the<00:02:09.690> idea<00:02:10.050> is<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.290> just<00:02:10.320> lay<00:02:10.710> the<00:02:10.890> bag

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
here so the idea is you just lay the bag

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.900 
here so the idea is you just lay the bag
down<00:02:12.770> unzip<00:02:13.770> it<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.070> Bank<00:02:14.340> there's<00:02:14.640> all<00:02:14.760> your

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
down unzip it and Bank there's all your

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.610 
down unzip it and Bank there's all your
stuff<00:02:15.090> right<00:02:15.270> there<00:02:15.510> again<00:02:16.290> it's<00:02:16.440> got<00:02:16.560> the

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
stuff right there again it's got the

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:26.030 
stuff right there again it's got the
