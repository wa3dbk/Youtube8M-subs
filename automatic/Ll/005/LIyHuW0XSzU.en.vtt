00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:18.120
 then another aspect of my game that 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.450
 still pretty recurrent and I like 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.570
 well 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.670
 is taping if a technique 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.690
 I like because I find that the 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.490
 ball obviously allows you to play fast 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.110
 but that completes my game which is 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.610
 more naturally in quotation marks the 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.210
 serge cakes am a lot of death 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.010
 the whole offer 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.360
 I do not necessarily attack all notes 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.130
 the pick is not necessarily hyper 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.930
 hyper accurate in timing to 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.950
 tomorrow unlike people like 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.239
 jean fontanille full of other patrick 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.920
 rondat 10 round trips extremely 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.809
 well synchronized me it's not my case 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.739
 so suddenly I developed a game in 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.880
 the cakes that is closer to this 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.230
 that can be done satriani and the fact of 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.579
 playing mapping allows you to add 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.450
 additional notes in the genre the 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.790
 cakes and it's true that I'm a 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.140
 big fan of van halen too but then 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.750
 here I want to show a little different 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.700
 different aspects of my tapping game 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.440
 and here it's the same thing 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.500
 you interested decides to digest it 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.820
 do your thing with then the principle 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.869
 tapping I think you know 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.399
 still all more or less 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.360
 this is again as I said of 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:17.680
 to add an additional other 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.149
 that we could not play by hand 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.890
 left with the right hand 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:24.420
 so the most classic examples if 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.420
 I take a potato onic of laminaria 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.830
 first position here at 5th ridiculous box 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.830
 I'm doing it again 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.520
 like that and so there is another 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.010
 position which here the 12th box and a 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.240
 second case of the shot to aa 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.680
 we will be able to play the notes they 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.240
 are good weight even give themselves a little 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.720
 artists to play all the notes on 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.720
 the second box 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.770
 1 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.469
 play it's our there with the left hand 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.409
 so me personally to do the 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.520
 carpet i tap with finger 3 is like 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.799
 it allows me to keep the pick 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.820
 in the left hand and I 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:13.349
 regularly phases where I'm going 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:21.000
 play play pick elbows on the 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:21.209
 handle almost it's a way of 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.190
 make 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.480
 but it's true that the fact of 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.400
 typing with 2.3 allows me to connect 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.950
 pick and finger of the left hand the 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.349
 room edith ares who taps with the finger 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.760
 a use by the way drop or take 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.410
 mathias and that we slip and that's it 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.150
 the opposite of me they wait in addition 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.380
 to keep mediator between the dean the 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.470
 two or three which frees the index for 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.000
 make the carpet find your handset 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.470
 your way of doing certain withdrawal 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.540
 pick a potting of the hand and that's 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.549
 frankly it's really up to you to 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.920
 see what suits you the most but 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:55.860
 in principle as I said it 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:03:00.510
 will play third 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.500
 right hand here and from there 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.420
 when you type the note 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.230
 you make me a lil bit like a 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.170
 little hammer they wanted 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:16.540
 series must be well laid on which one 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:24.879
 can even do a battle it's not up to 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:25.900
 you binza in tapping like that one well 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.579
 ringing note, leaving the 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.930
 finger well pressed and when we will do 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.519
 the opposite is what we will remove 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.170
 the right to expect as a small 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.120
 pull off in fact with the right hand 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.159
 serves how to lift your finger while doing 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.609
 your descendants slightly to make 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:38.609
 vibrate the rope 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.330
 1 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.770
 m 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.299
 it's that carpet notes ring with 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.340
 the same intensity and the same level of 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:01.760
 sound that notes in the left hand 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.959
 that's it and that's what I do to you 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.980
 advises to make these contracts years that 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.930
 I'm doing there 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.489
 work it's not a saturated sound the 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.140
 work earlier in his clear with the 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.000
 guitar unplug to see if 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.500
 precisely the same meaning filling in 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.500
 saturation if you others come out well 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.949
 this is very important to two 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.840
 tickets to that because otherwise if you 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:22.639
 work as saturated the situation to 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.760
 the end it will amplify your your 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.410
 sound volume of the notes and to compensate for 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.000
 a lack of momentum at the level of 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.130
 finger and is what does that after that 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.360
 you spend on them are clearer or 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.560
 on an acoustic guitar etc 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.600
 we try to have a game that is less 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.889
 less homogeneous and even some note 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.289
 they do not say it's really sound 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.850
 because just stupidly saturation 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:44.150
 will not be there for the booster 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.770
 so be careful about that then at 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.860
 level of the marrow carpet and I will spend 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.199
 once the basic principle explode 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.490
 hand in me i then use me actually 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:55.460
 I feel a lot the taping to come 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:58.120
 to make kids who would be funny a 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.120
 third course 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.840
 that kind of thing is something that 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.030
 I did quite often and that allows me 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.120
 having to b in fact a possibility of 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.380
 play more extensive cakes so I 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.410
 will show you after some examples 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.480
 a little more detailed way 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.620
 thing that I do too is the fact 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.180
 to go for tapping notes 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:31.120
 all isolated behind bullets at the 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:33.270
 tempe that's the fact on a simple 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.270
 note 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:45.500
 and that's for example already showing you 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.650
 examples with with these two aspects 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.650
 languages
