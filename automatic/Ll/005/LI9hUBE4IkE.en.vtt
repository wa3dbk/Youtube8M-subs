00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.830
 after the on paper somewhat easier 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.890
 opponents of the past few weeks 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.769
 psv full in the coming weeks 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.300
 twente from ajax home az from and 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.280
 in between too 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.080
 Europa League will be interesting 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.320
 weeks 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.420
 yes ok nice program nice competitions 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.449
 also in European competitions 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.340
 in the meantime similar to it 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.920
 with the first block actually made 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.300
 not so much about who the opponent is 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.189
 I think we should build ours 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.780
 team and ensure that we have our own 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.140
 We are going to perfect playing style there 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.059
 and we need time for that and yes 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.610
 we must measure our with with twente er 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.040
 comes a very interesting and heavy one 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.719
 series wherever we want to go 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.579
 have to sit down then 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.440
 steps without karim rekik he is 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.539
 Injured and unclear is how 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.329
 long out of circulation is just him 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.789
 Zaccaria Bakkali is usable again 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.379
 first just get over there riekie 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.460
 anyway a disappointment as a player 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.860
 is injured and yes what that situation is 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.400
 we know what has to happen 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.810
 still 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.909
 not yet but it is annoying that 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.510
 that injured is an open self all of them 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.670
 that who missed her can hook it up 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.229
 not too and she is no no it still in it 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.450
 played with your head recently, fine ones 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.369
 of course from young PSV substitutes 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.170
 have one extra available 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.330
 to get reinforcement in case he 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.860
 a little longer out of circulation is how 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.030
 after that at the moment is not yet on the 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.960
 order 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.880
 he is still investigating and 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.640
 for the time being we will keep the reinforcement that we have 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.570
 need from young PSV 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.820
 a man who is in the first pair 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.659
 Zakaria made such an impression 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.400
 bakkali 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.860
 there will be tomorrow evening in any case 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.159
 at yes just trained with is 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.689
 Belgium has been a week and next to you 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.159
 just came back and just got here 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.130
 trained so choose 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.110
 employable twente from what do you think of fc 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.960
 twente right now do yes i like it 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.790
 a good soccer team 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.509
 many short combination technically skilled 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.369
 players also notify attackers that 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.020
 actually we want with the arrival of 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.940
 everything 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.360
 how we play backwards 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.270
 is a lot of creativity a lot of movements 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.500
 after another side, they like that themselves 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.170
 you can often play football yourself 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.739
 against footballer so becomes interesting 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.420
 contest 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.340
 it will not be that it is the team 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.930
 those like robot the lower 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.489
 classified teams lately 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.270
 on top of the PSV blows on those which Me 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.890
 make it very difficult 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.650
 twente will also want their own house and 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.890
 have to play football yes that is anyway 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.560
 characteristic of twente certainly home player 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.090
 you see aggressiveness and pressure on 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.260
 it is part of the game we do ourselves 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.580
 also her philosophy of energy from it 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.930
 think from the football of things 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.200
 from possession 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.269
 that does that we do not become what 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.160
 things sounds we close and it seems 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.599
 He is likely that Jorrit Hendrix the 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.610
 logical replacement is for the 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.739
 karim rekik all injured 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.280
 phillip cocu that didn't want it yet 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.280
 confirm
