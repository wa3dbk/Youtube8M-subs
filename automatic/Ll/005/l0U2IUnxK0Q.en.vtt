right<00:01:54.000> now<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.659> library<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:55.229> the

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
right now is in the library of the

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.679 
right now is in the library of the
stronghold<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.399> there<00:01:56.729> was<00:01:56.850> no<00:01:57.030> chest<00:01:57.390> that

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
stronghold and there was no chest that

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:58.910 
stronghold and there was no chest that
have<00:01:57.810> any<00:01:57.990> books<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.380> them<00:01:58.560> or<00:01:58.680> anything

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
have any books in them or anything

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.530 
have any books in them or anything
because<00:01:59.790> once<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.210> goes<00:02:00.299> up<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.509> ladder

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
because once it goes up the ladder

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.670 
because once it goes up the ladder
there's<00:02:01.350> no<00:02:01.439> chest<00:02:01.710> up<00:02:01.860> here<00:02:02.119> so<00:02:03.200> yeah<00:02:04.200> this

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
there's no chest up here so yeah this

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.479 
there's no chest up here so yeah this
really<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.130> going<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.340> conclude<00:02:05.640> the

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:07.489 
really is going to conclude the

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:11.600 
really is going to conclude the
generated<00:02:08.489> structures<00:02:08.819> for<00:02:09.569> video<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.619> four

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
generated structures for video that four

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.290 
generated structures for video that four
days<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.910> do<00:02:12.030> is<00:02:12.150> put<00:02:12.360> up

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
days to do is put up

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.300 
days to do is put up
we<00:02:13.450> will<00:02:13.570> be<00:02:13.690> getting<00:02:13.810> into<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.530> food<00:02:14.830> video

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
we will be getting into the food video

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.900 
we will be getting into the food video
they<00:02:15.580> put<00:02:15.850> it<00:02:15.940> up<00:02:16.060> a<00:02:16.270> couple<00:02:16.390> weeks<00:02:16.660> ago<00:02:17.910> all

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
they put it up a couple weeks ago all

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.780 
they put it up a couple weeks ago all
right<00:02:19.090> so<00:02:19.420> as<00:02:19.690> we<00:02:20.110> start<00:02:20.140> off<00:02:20.440> right<00:02:20.590> now<00:02:20.800> they

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
right so as we start off right now they

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.780 
right so as we start off right now they
does<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.030> screen<00:02:22.990> right<00:02:23.140> here<00:02:23.200> and<00:02:23.790> right

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
does the screen right here and right

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.300 
does the screen right here and right
away<00:02:25.420> he's<00:02:25.690> going<00:02:25.870> to<00:02:25.960> be<00:02:26.020> killing<00:02:26.260> some<00:02:26.440> mobs

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
says it will right there there is

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.820 
says it will right there there is
parrying<00:02:37.000> now<00:02:37.180> so<00:02:37.600> you<00:02:37.660> can<00:02:37.960> block<00:02:38.200> skeletons

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
parrying now so you can block skeletons

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.650 
parrying now so you can block skeletons
and<00:02:39.040> explosions<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:39.850> all<00:02:39.910> that<00:02:40.090> stuff<00:02:42.360> yeah<00:02:43.360> I

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
and explosions and all that stuff yeah I

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.650 
and explosions and all that stuff yeah I
think<00:02:44.260> next<00:02:44.470> he's<00:02:44.650> going<00:02:44.710> to<00:02:44.860> be<00:02:44.920> showing<00:02:45.100> the

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
think next he's going to be showing the

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.660 
think next he's going to be showing the
new<00:02:46.660> types<00:02:46.930> of<00:02:47.110> food<00:02:47.290> that<00:02:47.320> would<00:02:47.770> be<00:02:47.920> added<00:02:48.520> in

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
new types of food that would be added in

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.930 
new types of food that would be added in
the<00:02:48.700> update<00:02:49.350> so<00:02:50.350> right<00:02:50.800> now<00:02:50.830> he<00:02:51.070> is<00:02:51.610> going<00:02:51.730> to

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
be showing that Apple's can be dropped

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.920 
be showing that Apple's can be dropped
from<00:02:53.920> trees<00:02:54.220> now<00:02:54.520> it<00:02:55.330> is<00:02:55.420> always<00:02:55.570> a<00:02:55.690> good<00:02:55.780> thing

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
from trees now it is always a good thing

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.100 
from trees now it is always a good thing
because<00:02:56.320> it's<00:02:56.560> a<00:02:56.650> quick<00:02:56.860> food<00:02:57.190> source

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
because it's a quick food source

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.840 
because it's a quick food source
watermelons<00:02:59.110> now<00:02:59.350> which<00:02:59.950> will<00:03:00.130> be<00:03:00.280> produced

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
watermelons now which will be produced

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.450 
watermelons now which will be produced
in<00:03:01.000> New<00:03:01.330> generated<00:03:01.930> structures<00:03:02.140> it<00:03:03.130> will<00:03:03.280> not

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
in New generated structures it will not

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.820 
in New generated structures it will not
be<00:03:03.700> on<00:03:04.000> maps<00:03:04.750> that<00:03:04.930> you<00:03:05.050> already<00:03:05.200> have<00:03:05.500> so<00:03:05.740> you

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
be on maps that you already have so you

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.820 
be on maps that you already have so you
will<00:03:05.980> have<00:03:06.010> to<00:03:06.190> create<00:03:06.910> a<00:03:07.000> new<00:03:07.150> world<00:03:07.330> for

in the pc version but now it's actually

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.810 
in the pc version but now it's actually
introduced<00:03:39.040> into<00:03:39.190> this<00:03:39.400> one<00:03:39.550> instead<00:03:39.760> of

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
introduced into this one instead of

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.790 
introduced into this one instead of
dragging<00:03:40.000> in<00:03:40.270> there<00:03:40.390> all<00:03:40.510> the<00:03:40.570> time<00:03:40.739> right<00:03:41.739> now

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.960 
stuff I don't understand the reason to
do<00:03:47.650> this<00:03:47.680> since<00:03:48.010> it<00:03:48.130> was<00:03:48.220> already<00:03:48.310> in<00:03:48.640> the<00:03:48.670> game

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
do this since it was already in the game

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.780 
do this since it was already in the game
but<00:03:49.480> i<00:03:49.720> guess<00:03:49.959> it<00:03:50.110> was<00:03:50.140> in<00:03:51.100> his<00:03:51.310> school<00:03:51.550> video
