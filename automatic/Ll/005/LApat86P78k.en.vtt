00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.660 
and you know what I'm already kept
losing<00:01:53.290> my<00:01:53.560> wind<00:01:53.800> here<00:01:54.040> so<00:01:54.190> let<00:01:54.310> me<00:01:54.370> just<00:01:54.520> do<00:01:54.640> a

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
losing my wind here so let me just do a

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.030 
losing my wind here so let me just do a
scan<00:01:55.030> again<00:01:55.360> of<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:56.320> rest<00:01:56.530> of<00:01:56.710> the<00:01:56.770> floor

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
scan again of the rest of the floor

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.859 
scan again of the rest of the floor
we've<00:01:57.220> got<00:01:57.369> flea<00:01:57.610> market<00:01:57.940> tables<00:01:58.330> all<00:01:58.540> along

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
we've got flea market tables all along

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.800 
we've got flea market tables all along
the<00:01:59.020> side<00:01:59.290> they've<00:02:00.040> got<00:02:00.220> another<00:02:00.520> gosh<00:02:00.880> 2025

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
the side they've got another gosh 2025

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.050 
the side they've got another gosh 2025
table's<00:02:02.200> worth<00:02:02.290> of<00:02:02.560> games<00:02:02.740> going<00:02:03.220> on<00:02:03.369> so<00:02:04.030> I

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
table's worth of games going on so I

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.940 
table's worth of games going on so I
guess<00:02:04.270> that's<00:02:04.420> just<00:02:04.570> a<00:02:04.750> quick<00:02:04.930> sneak<00:02:05.320> peak<00:02:05.650> at

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
guess that's just a quick sneak peak at

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.190 
guess that's just a quick sneak peak at
about<00:02:06.390> one-third<00:02:07.390> or<00:02:07.540> one-fourth<00:02:07.990> of<00:02:08.140> the

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
about one-third or one-fourth of the

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.160 
about one-third or one-fourth of the
games<00:02:08.440> going<00:02:08.709> on<00:02:08.890> right<00:02:09.130> now
