quickly<00:00:21.980> ground<00:00:22.980> balancing<00:00:23.460> on<00:00:23.609> this<00:00:23.789> how

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
quickly ground balancing on this how

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.060 
quickly ground balancing on this how
easy<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.630> then<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.590> want<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.890> show<00:00:26.010> you

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
easy it is and then I want to show you

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.560 
easy it is and then I want to show you
the<00:00:26.189> knotch<00:00:26.430> feature<00:00:26.760> that<00:00:27.060> they<00:00:27.240> added<00:00:27.269> to

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
the knotch feature that they added to

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.710 
the knotch feature that they added to
this<00:00:28.580> which<00:00:29.580> doesn't<00:00:30.210> get<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.330> lot<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.570> play

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
this which doesn't get a lot of play

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.060 
this which doesn't get a lot of play
doesn't<00:00:31.199> get<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.320> lot<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.500> air<00:00:31.619> time<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.830> don't

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
doesn't get a lot of air time I don't

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.160 
doesn't get a lot of air time I don't
see<00:00:32.189> too<00:00:32.340> much<00:00:32.460> on<00:00:32.699> it<00:00:32.730> but<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:32.970> want<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.180> show

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
see too much on it but I want to show

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.660 
see too much on it but I want to show
you<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.410> knotch<00:00:34.650> feature<00:00:34.980> that's<00:00:35.250> built<00:00:35.430> into

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
you the knotch feature that's built into

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.990 
you the knotch feature that's built into
the<00:00:35.850> unit<00:00:36.149> it's<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:37.050> fixed<00:00:37.410> knotch

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
the unit it's a fixed knotch

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.080 
the unit it's a fixed knotch
not<00:00:39.000> adjustable<00:00:39.480> obviously<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.820> it<00:00:41.820> works

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
not adjustable obviously and it works

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.740 
not adjustable obviously and it works
very<00:00:42.540> well<00:00:42.680> but<00:00:43.680> like<00:00:43.770> most<00:00:43.950> notches<00:00:44.629> you<00:00:45.629> know

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
very well but like most notches you know

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.580 
very well but like most notches you know
it<00:00:45.809> has<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.340> downside<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:47.940> we'll<00:00:48.840> go<00:00:48.960> over

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
it has a downside to it so we'll go over

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.860 
it has a downside to it so we'll go over
ground<00:00:49.920> balance<00:00:50.219> first<00:00:50.489> what<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.300> typically<00:00:51.660> do

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
ground balance first what I typically do

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.619 
ground balance first what I typically do
on<00:00:51.899> ground<00:00:52.469> balancing<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.010> unit<00:00:53.450> is<00:00:54.450> I'll

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
on ground balancing the unit is I'll

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.770 
on ground balancing the unit is I'll
take<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.340> sense<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.520> up<00:00:56.610> I'll<00:00:57.030> lower<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.690> a

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
take the sense and up I'll lower it a

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.619 
take the sense and up I'll lower it a
little<00:00:57.930> bit<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:59.100> about<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.370> seven<00:00:59.850> or<00:01:00.000> an<00:01:00.570> eight

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
little bit to about a seven or an eight

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.029 
little bit to about a seven or an eight
on<00:01:01.020> this<00:01:01.770> machine<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:03.690> toggle<00:01:04.110> switch<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:05.029 --> 00:01:05.039 
on this machine the toggle switch the

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:07.480 
on this machine the toggle switch the
three<00:01:05.220> position<00:01:05.640> switch<00:01:05.759> on<00:01:06.060> this<00:01:06.210> side<00:01:06.479> is

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
three position switch on this side is

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.219 
three position switch on this side is
set<00:01:08.490> for<00:01:08.700> ground<00:01:09.650> and<00:01:10.650> corn<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.130> jewelry<00:01:11.460> and

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
set for ground and corn and jewelry and

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.420 
set for ground and corn and jewelry and
the<00:01:13.229> next<00:01:13.439> thing<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.619> do<00:01:13.710> obviously<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:14.130> find

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
the next thing you do obviously is find

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.770 
the next thing you do obviously is find
a<00:01:14.549> nice<00:01:14.729> piece<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.000> ground<00:01:15.240> with<00:01:15.450> those<00:01:15.570> no

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
a nice piece of ground with those no

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.039 
a nice piece of ground with those no
targets<00:01:16.260> and<00:01:17.000> so<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.180> have<00:01:18.360> here<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:18.930> a

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
targets and so you have here this is a

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.859 
targets and so you have here this is a
nice<00:01:19.259> clean<00:01:19.439> area<00:01:19.799> up<00:01:20.670> here<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:21.150> obviously

and<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.780> listen<00:01:30.900> for<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.290> threshold<00:01:31.530> and

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
and you listen for the threshold and

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.359 
and you listen for the threshold and
when<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.210> equalizes<00:01:33.600> like<00:01:34.020> any<00:01:34.200> detector<00:01:34.950> your

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
when it equalizes like any detector your

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.249 
when it equalizes like any detector your
ground<00:01:35.640> balanced<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.119> ready<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.420> go<00:01:36.600> that's

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
ground balanced and ready to go that's

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.130 
ground balanced and ready to go that's
simple<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:38.790> quickly<00:01:39.240> move<00:01:39.390> on<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.750> just<00:01:39.960> want<00:01:40.079> to

we<00:01:44.460> went<00:01:44.700> over<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:44.909> toggle<00:01:45.390> switch<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.780> little

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
we went over this toggle switch a little

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.230 
we went over this toggle switch a little
yesterday<00:01:46.350> there's<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.680> toggle<00:01:46.979> switch<00:01:47.240> as

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
yesterday there's this toggle switch as

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.469 
yesterday there's this toggle switch as
a<00:01:48.270> forward<00:01:48.630> lock<00:01:48.960> position<00:01:50.000> middle<00:01:51.000> position

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
a forward lock position middle position

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.319 
a forward lock position middle position
and<00:01:51.899> then<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.259> spring-loaded<00:01:52.920> pull<00:01:53.759> position

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
and then a spring-loaded pull position

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.109 
and then a spring-loaded pull position
now<00:01:54.899> when<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.110> pull<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.710> hold<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:57.000> go

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
now when you pull it and hold it you go

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.910 
now when you pull it and hold it you go
into<00:01:59.570> pinpointing<00:02:00.570> mode<00:02:00.750> when<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.560> pull<00:02:01.799> it

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
into pinpointing mode when you pull it

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.109 
into pinpointing mode when you pull it
here<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.280> go<00:02:02.399> over<00:02:02.520> your<00:02:02.610> target<00:02:02.790> that's

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
here you go over your target that's

pinpointing this is normal operation and

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.680 
pinpointing this is normal operation and
when<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.210> push<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.840> forward<00:02:07.640> okay<00:02:08.640> you're<00:02:09.570> in

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
when you push it forward okay you're in

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.869 
when you push it forward okay you're in
the<00:02:09.750> notch<00:02:10.079> mode<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.739> it's<00:02:11.190> designed<00:02:11.670> to

quick<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:25.680> then<00:02:26.519> unfortunately<00:02:27.530> like<00:02:28.530> with<00:02:28.709> a

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
quick and then unfortunately like with a

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.790 
quick and then unfortunately like with a
lot<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.010> machines<00:02:29.900> when<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:30.989> start<00:02:31.230> notching

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
lot of machines when you start notching

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.830 
lot of machines when you start notching
or<00:02:32.099> discriminating<00:02:32.730> out<00:02:32.880> certain<00:02:33.269> areas<00:02:33.630> of

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
or discriminating out certain areas of

or discriminating out certain areas of
the<00:02:34.110> conductivity<00:02:34.910> field<00:02:35.910> you<00:02:36.269> also<00:02:36.300> start

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
the conductivity field you also start

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.020 
the conductivity field you also start
eliminating<00:02:37.019> good<00:02:37.560> targets<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.849> what<00:02:38.970> I'm

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
eliminating good targets so what I'm

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.240 
eliminating good targets so what I'm
going<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.180> do<00:02:39.300> is<00:02:39.420> turn<00:02:39.569> them<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:40.250> video

ready<00:02:54.840> to<00:02:54.989> go<00:02:55.140> now<00:02:55.170> I've<00:02:55.530> got<00:02:56.340> a<00:02:56.370> pull<00:02:56.670> tab

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
ready to go now I've got a pull tab

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.449 
ready to go now I've got a pull tab
right<00:02:57.720> here<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:58.500> it<00:02:59.099> might<00:02:59.220> be<00:02:59.250> a<00:02:59.370> little

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
right here and it might be a little

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.100 
right here and it might be a little
tough<00:02:59.760> to<00:02:59.790> see<00:03:00.120> it's<00:03:00.269> to<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.599> left<00:03:00.870> of<00:03:01.019> the

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
tough to see it's to the left of the

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.770 
tough to see it's to the left of the
coil<00:03:01.489> well<00:03:02.489> I<00:03:02.640> kind<00:03:02.910> of<00:03:02.970> angled<00:03:03.480> it<00:03:03.569> a<00:03:03.599> little

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
coil well I kind of angled it a little

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.000 
coil well I kind of angled it a little
bit<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.019> you<00:03:04.110> may<00:03:04.230> be<00:03:04.290> able<00:03:04.410> to<00:03:04.560> see<00:03:04.709> it<00:03:04.799> in<00:03:04.920> the

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
bit so you may be able to see it in the

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.979 
bit so you may be able to see it in the
Sun<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.360> then<00:03:06.360> over<00:03:06.780> here<00:03:07.610> there<00:03:08.610> is<00:03:08.910> again<00:03:09.810> to

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
Sun and then over here there is again to
