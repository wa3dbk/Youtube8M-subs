00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
think he's really finding his top shape

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.939 
think he's really finding his top shape
now<00:00:44.390> what<00:00:45.390> about<00:00:45.510> come<00:00:46.079> back<00:00:46.290> of<00:00:46.440> communist

was surprised for you that he showed

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.119 
was surprised for you that he showed
here<00:00:49.680> for<00:00:50.489> hills<00:00:50.699> no<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.690> think<00:00:52.019> if<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.469> have<00:00:52.620> as

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
here for hills no I think if you have as

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.790 
here for hills no I think if you have as
a<00:00:53.780> specimen<00:00:54.780> if<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:54.989> have<00:00:55.109> a<00:00:55.140> chance<00:00:55.710> to

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
a specimen if you have a chance to

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.770 
a specimen if you have a chance to
compete<00:00:56.609> you<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:57.120> should<00:00:58.109> do<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:59.010> he

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
compete you you should do it and so he

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.749 
compete you you should do it and so he
had<00:01:00.780> some<00:01:01.649> solid<00:01:02.160> chumps<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.949> sure<00:01:04.949> not<00:01:05.190> not

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
had some solid chumps and sure not not

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.400 
had some solid chumps and sure not not
perfect<00:01:06.210> but<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.420> think<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.560> best<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.950> he

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.410 
perfect but I think the best that he

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.830 
perfect but I think the best that he
tried<00:01:10.410> to<00:01:10.590> reach<00:01:10.770> his<00:01:11.039> top<00:01:11.940> top<00:01:12.330> shape<00:01:12.539> and

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
tried to reach his top top shape and

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.590 
tried to reach his top top shape and
we'll<00:01:13.440> see<00:01:13.590> what<00:01:13.740> happens<00:01:13.860> tomorrow<00:01:14.190> I'm

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
we'll see what happens tomorrow I'm

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.710 
we'll see what happens tomorrow I'm
hopeful<00:01:15.600> him<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.960> he<00:01:16.729> not<00:01:17.729> get<00:01:17.909> any<00:01:18.149> problems

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
hopeful him that he not get any problems

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.010 
hopeful him that he not get any problems
with<00:01:18.899> his<00:01:19.080> foot<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.729> if<00:01:20.729> he<00:01:20.970> has<00:01:21.569> no<00:01:21.750> pain<00:01:21.989> I

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
with his foot and if he has no pain I

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.830 
with his foot and if he has no pain I
