00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
yes how you said that when the recession

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.440 
yes how you said that when the recession
happened<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.160> gold<00:00:23.370> prices<00:00:23.670> shot<00:00:24.030> up<00:00:24.090> oh

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:24.450 
happened that the gold prices shot up oh

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.750 
happened that the gold prices shot up oh
is<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.200> the<00:00:25.680> sign<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.160> gold<00:00:26.340> prices<00:00:26.550> going

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
is it the sign of the gold prices going

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.340 
is it the sign of the gold prices going
down<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.270> the<00:00:27.360> recession<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:27.930> starting<00:00:28.230> to

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:28.350 
down that the recession is starting to

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:34.000 
down that the recession is starting to
him<00:00:29.030> yes<00:00:30.030> so<00:00:30.390> it's<00:00:30.750> it's<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.560> complicated

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
him yes so it's it's a complicated

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.320 
him yes so it's it's a complicated
series<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.190> things<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.640> are<00:00:35.730> happening<00:00:35.910> but

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:36.330 
series of things that are happening but

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:42.140 
series of things that are happening but
generally<00:00:36.930> that's<00:00:37.590> right<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.630> with<00:00:41.150> generally

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
generally that's right so with generally

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.110 
generally that's right so with generally
mixed<00:00:42.540> results<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.710> economy<00:00:44.309> but<00:00:44.910> more

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
mixed results in the economy but more

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.990 
mixed results in the economy but more
positive<00:00:45.750> than<00:00:45.780> negative<00:00:46.460> people<00:00:47.460> think<00:00:47.760> that

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
positive than negative people think that

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.240 
positive than negative people think that
the<00:00:48.239> economy<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.839> beginning<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.589> recover<00:00:49.769> and

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
the economy is beginning to recover and

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.619 
the economy is beginning to recover and
so<00:00:50.879> therefore<00:00:52.640> the<00:00:53.640> dollar<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.210> becoming

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
so therefore the dollar is becoming

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.689 
so therefore the dollar is becoming
stronger<00:00:55.080> and<00:00:55.440> more<00:00:55.530> stable<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.159> when<00:00:56.430> that

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
stronger and more stable and when that

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.030 
stronger and more stable and when that
happens<00:00:56.730> then<00:00:57.570> gold<00:00:58.019> prices<00:00:58.230> start<00:00:58.769> going

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
happens then gold prices start going

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.270 
happens then gold prices start going
down<00:00:59.600> and<00:01:00.600> when<00:01:01.379> during<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.100> financial

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
down and when during the financial

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.490 
down and when during the financial
crisis<00:01:02.940> when<00:01:03.150> the<00:01:03.239> dollar<00:01:03.449> fluctuated<00:01:04.230> a<00:01:04.290> lot

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
crisis when the dollar fluctuated a lot

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.020 
crisis when the dollar fluctuated a lot
and<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:05.010> looked<00:01:05.220> like<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.460> economy<00:01:05.670> wasn't

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
and it looked like the economy wasn't

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.300 
and it looked like the economy wasn't
doing<00:01:06.330> really<00:01:06.570> good<00:01:06.810> then<00:01:07.500> people<00:01:07.770> fled<00:01:08.159> to

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
doing really good then people fled to

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.500 
doing really good then people fled to
something<00:01:08.640> safer<00:01:09.090> like<00:01:09.690> gold<00:01:10.729> but<00:01:11.729> what<00:01:12.360> I

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
something safer like gold but what I

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.350 
something safer like gold but what I
believe<00:01:13.050> will<00:01:13.350> impact<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.729> future<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:15.180> gold

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
believe will impact the future of gold

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.060 
believe will impact the future of gold
prices<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:16.400> when<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.550> chart<00:01:17.909> out<00:01:18.950> when<00:01:19.950> you

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
prices is when you chart out when you

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.980 
prices is when you chart out when you
take<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.280> look<00:01:20.430> at<00:01:20.520> gold<00:01:20.729> prices<00:01:21.030> what<00:01:21.780> does<00:01:21.960> a

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
take a look at gold prices what does a

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.870 
take a look at gold prices what does a
correlate<00:01:22.500> best<00:01:22.799> one<00:01:23.009> are<00:01:23.579> there<00:01:23.759> other

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
correlate best one are there other

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.819 
correlate best one are there other
factors<00:01:24.180> out<00:01:24.570> there<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.259> have<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.649> same

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:25.829 
factors out there that have the same

factors out there that have the same
track<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.520> can<00:01:26.729> we<00:01:26.759> use<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.090> track<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.840> kind

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
track and can we use that track to kind

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.300 
track and can we use that track to kind
of<00:01:28.110> predict<00:01:28.409> where<00:01:28.560> gold<00:01:28.799> prices<00:01:29.009> are<00:01:29.250> going

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
of predict where gold prices are going

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.569 
of predict where gold prices are going
to<00:01:29.430> be<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.390> most<00:01:30.600> accurate<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:32.039> highest

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
to be and the most accurate and highest

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.149 
to be and the most accurate and highest
correlating<00:01:33.180> track<00:01:33.539> is<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.530> amount<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.920> debt

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
correlating track is the amount of debt

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.999 
correlating track is the amount of debt
a<00:01:35.399> country<00:01:36.149> accumulates<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.990> when<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.860> take

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
a country accumulates and when you take

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.850 
a country accumulates and when you take
a<00:01:38.039> look<00:01:38.250> at<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.430> u.s.<00:01:38.700> debt<00:01:39.110> and<00:01:40.110> track<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.680> for

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
a look at the u.s. debt and track it for

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.279 
a look at the u.s. debt and track it for
like<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.159> last<00:01:41.310> 30<00:01:41.610> years<00:01:41.780> you'll<00:01:42.780> find<00:01:43.110> out

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
like the last 30 years you'll find out

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.270 
like the last 30 years you'll find out
that<00:01:43.590> for<00:01:43.890> 28<00:01:44.789> and<00:01:44.969> a<00:01:45.000> half<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.509> those<00:01:45.719> years

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
that for 28 and a half of those years

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.969 
that for 28 and a half of those years
there's<00:01:47.280> been<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.969> lockstep<00:01:48.840> between<00:01:49.530> gold

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
there's been a lockstep between gold

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.740 
there's been a lockstep between gold
prices<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.820> amount<00:01:50.969> of<00:01:51.149> debt<00:01:51.359> and<00:01:51.560> so<00:01:52.609> I

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
prices in the amount of debt and so I

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.630 
prices in the amount of debt and so I
believe<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:55.170> once<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.890> economy<00:01:56.280> starts<00:01:56.520> to

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
believe that once the economy starts to

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.370 
believe that once the economy starts to
recover<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.299> then<00:01:57.390> people<00:01:57.659> start<00:01:57.869> realizing

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
recover and then people start realizing

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.810 
recover and then people start realizing
we<00:01:58.439> have<00:01:58.560> all<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:58.890> debt<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.429> we<00:01:59.520> still<00:01:59.640> have

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
we have all this debt that we still have

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.419 
we have all this debt that we still have
to<00:01:59.939> pay<00:02:00.350> yes<00:02:01.350> we're<00:02:01.679> all<00:02:01.799> glad<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
to pay yes we're all glad that the

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:06.940 
to pay yes we're all glad that the
economy<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:03.950> is<00:02:04.950> providing<00:02:05.429> jobs<00:02:05.700> again<00:02:06.090> and

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
economy is is providing jobs again and

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.710 
economy is is providing jobs again and
and<00:02:07.950> people<00:02:08.700> are<00:02:08.789> buying<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.270> selling<00:02:09.300> things

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
and people are buying and selling things

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.050 
and people are buying and selling things
a<00:02:09.929> little<00:02:10.080> bit<00:02:10.229> more<00:02:10.790> eventually<00:02:11.790> people<00:02:11.940> are

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
a little bit more eventually people are

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.380 
a little bit more eventually people are
going<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.240> realize<00:02:13.040> we<00:02:14.040> just<00:02:14.310> borrowed<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.880> lot

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
going to realize we just borrowed a lot

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.740 
going to realize we just borrowed a lot
of<00:02:15.600> money<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:17.270> it's<00:02:18.270> going<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.480> be<00:02:18.600> really

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
of money and it's going to be really

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.630 
of money and it's going to be really
tough<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.200> pay<00:02:19.350> that<00:02:19.380> back<00:02:19.710> over<00:02:19.950> time<00:02:20.220> and

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
tough to pay that back over time and

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.940 
tough to pay that back over time and
once<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:21.240> starts<00:02:21.570> happening<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:22.320> think<00:02:22.830> the

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
once that starts happening I think the

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.580 
once that starts happening I think the
correlation<00:02:23.550> is<00:02:24.150> going<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.480> start<00:02:24.720> happening

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
correlation is going to start happening

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.830
