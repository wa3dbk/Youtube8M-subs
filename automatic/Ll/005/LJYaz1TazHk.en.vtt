00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729

themselves<00:01:57.140> and<00:01:58.140> we've<00:01:58.290> got<00:01:58.439> those<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:59.310> then

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
themselves and we've got those and then

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.310 
themselves and we've got those and then

that's what you like and here's all of
our<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.430> guess<00:02:05.850> this<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.149> our<00:02:06.299> breakdown<00:02:06.540> of

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
our I guess this is our breakdown of

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.710 
our I guess this is our breakdown of
what<00:02:07.020> we've<00:02:07.170> purchased<00:02:08.119> and<00:02:09.119> all<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.599> our

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
what we've purchased and all of our

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.960 
what we've purchased and all of our
stuff<00:02:09.929> our<00:02:10.080> hotel<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:11.160> every

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
stuff our hotel and every

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.570 
stuff our hotel and every
these<00:02:12.970> are<00:02:13.270> our<00:02:13.510> I<00:02:14.380> think<00:02:15.100> these<00:02:15.340> are<00:02:15.490> the

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
these are our I think these are the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.290 
these are our I think these are the
fastest<00:02:16.420> fast<00:02:16.720> pass<00:02:17.490> yeah<00:02:18.490> the<00:02:18.610> fast<00:02:18.850> pass<00:02:19.120> the

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
fastest fast pass yeah the fast pass the

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.120 
fastest fast pass yeah the fast pass the
lines<00:02:19.630> are<00:02:19.900> for<00:02:20.140> end<00:02:20.350> as<00:02:20.590> you<00:02:20.770> wouldn't<00:02:21.010> you

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
lines are for end as you wouldn't you

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.920 
lines are for end as you wouldn't you
just<00:02:21.280> imagine<00:02:21.850> you<00:02:21.940> spend<00:02:22.120> hours<00:02:22.660> of<00:02:22.840> the

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
just imagine you spend hours of the

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.960 
just imagine you spend hours of the
linings<00:02:23.380> so<00:02:23.890> these<00:02:24.010> are<00:02:24.160> fast<00:02:24.400> pass<00:02:24.640> that<00:02:24.850> we

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
linings so these are fast pass that we

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.490 
linings so these are fast pass that we

way<00:06:40.420> so<00:06:40.750> what<00:06:40.900> I'm<00:06:40.990> saying<00:06:41.200> before<00:06:41.440> that<00:06:41.680> it's

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.010 
way so what I'm saying before that it's

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.920 
way so what I'm saying before that it's
like<00:06:42.130> kind<00:06:42.310> of<00:06:42.340> like<00:06:42.490> going<00:06:42.670> to<00:06:42.760> Hawaii<00:06:43.270> I<00:06:43.720> mean

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:43.930 
like kind of like going to Hawaii I mean

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.260 
like kind of like going to Hawaii I mean
I<00:06:44.020> think<00:06:44.080> you<00:06:44.290> can<00:06:44.440> get<00:06:44.560> package<00:06:44.890> deals<00:06:45.270> from

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.270 
I think you can get package deals from

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.870 
I think you can get package deals from
California<00:06:46.870> for<00:06:47.050> to<00:06:47.770> go<00:06:47.890> to<00:06:47.950> Hawaii<00:06:48.100> you<00:06:48.790> know

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 
California for to go to Hawaii you know

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.580 
California for to go to Hawaii you know
for<00:06:49.120> three<00:06:49.480> probably<00:06:50.050> for<00:06:50.290> about<00:06:50.350> the<00:06:50.560> same

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:50.590 
for three probably for about the same

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.590 
for three probably for about the same
rate<00:06:50.980> so<00:06:51.280> if<00:06:51.460> someone<00:06:51.730> was<00:06:51.850> jokingly<00:06:52.270> said

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:52.600 
rate so if someone was jokingly said

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.910 
rate so if someone was jokingly said
that<00:06:52.720> to<00:06:52.840> me<00:06:52.960> but<00:06:53.110> I<00:06:53.170> think<00:06:53.260> that<00:06:53.530> it<00:06:53.620> really<00:06:53.740> is

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:53.920 
that to me but I think that it really is

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.510 
that to me but I think that it really is
true<00:06:54.130> is<00:06:54.580> it<00:06:54.850> worth<00:06:55.030> it<00:06:55.180> absolutely<00:06:56.280> it's<00:06:57.280> like

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 
true is it worth it absolutely it's like

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.970 
true is it worth it absolutely it's like
I<00:06:57.610> said<00:06:57.670> before<00:06:57.820> Japan<00:06:58.630> Disneyland<00:06:59.350> is<00:06:59.590> in<00:06:59.860> a

00:06:59.970 --> 00:06:59.980 
I said before Japan Disneyland is in a

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.800 
I said before Japan Disneyland is in a
league<00:07:00.190> on<00:07:00.490> its<00:07:00.670> own<00:07:00.850> I<00:07:01.150> would<00:07:01.300> love<00:07:01.480> to<00:07:01.630> see

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:01.810 
league on its own I would love to see

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.120 
league on its own I would love to see
Disney<00:07:02.140> vans<00:07:02.320> in<00:07:02.440> other<00:07:02.560> parts<00:07:02.860> of<00:07:02.890> the<00:07:02.980> world

but I can't imagine that any could quite

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.840 
but I can't imagine that any could quite
