00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.629
 hello hello in this tutorial i love you 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:10.549
 teach how to make this original easy 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:12.590
 bottled letter that besides being 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:15.320
 different is very original because it is not 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.939
 like the others a rolled paper because 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.160
 this one has its crazy current style 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:21.080
 because it 's a super long strip where 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.180
 you can write if you want to learn to 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.430
 make do not miss this video 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.390
 let's occupy colored sheets though 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:35.220
 You can also use rule cardstock 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.200
 scissors a pencil we are going to occupy a 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.090
 half liter bottle how are you this 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.920
 it's from jumex I recommend you take it 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.449
 is because this is highly recommended and 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.449
 besides that he does not have ugly letters 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.050
 we will also use markers or pens 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.870
 of gel to write 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.230
 glue in liquid silicone bar as 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.699
 adamantine diamond adhesive what 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.710
 you want to put the inside of the bottle 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.199
 and to decorate we need ribbons or 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.229
 buttons or whatever you want besides 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.060
 Corrugated cardboard and thick cardboard I'll 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.580
 I recommend for corrugated cardboard two 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.710
 colors 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.630
 we start by taking the leaves and 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.130
 immediately the bottle and in this case the 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.680
 I will use as a reference for 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.820
 we can guide much better this 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.620
 bottle has a height of 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.510
 approximately 20 centimeters 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.940
 which is ideal and is very recommended that 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.890
 can fit a very large letter in this 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.840
 case I recommend that you make band-aids 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.160
 one centimeter thick because it is 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.070
 much easier and you can enter 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.440
 between 10 to 30 strips and in this case I will 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.770
 use 12 strips but you can do 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.770
 plus 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.150
 ready you should have strips of a 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.070
 centimeter thick between 10 and 30 and in 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.170
 this case I made 12 because the letter is not going 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.540
 to be very long then stop this from 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.850
 side takes the corrugated cardboard and 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.730
 extend it this we will use it as 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.250
 base for the lid then let's 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.630
 use the mouthpiece as a reference 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.900
 the bottle 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.710
 then take it and put it down 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:11.479
 and let's trace its outline twice 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.479
 to then cut the circles 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.530
 and we repeat the same procedure for 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.530
 the thick cardboard 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.420
 we should have two 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.730
 circles of thick cardboard and two of 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.190
 corrugated cardboard all with the same 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.380
 measurement of the bottle nozzle leaves 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.420
 this sideways and take the other carton 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.110
 corrugated in this let's make a 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.620
 figure of 2.5 x 15 centimeters and the 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.620
 we cut 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.430
 his figure is 2.5 x 15 centimeters 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.920
 leave this aside and take 1 take the 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.020
 circles let's start with the 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.000
 thick cardboard circles we are going to 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.330
 put them glue to be able to paste one 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.330
 over another 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.000
 then we put silicon in the part 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.000
 higher 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.770
 we paste one of the corrugated cartons and 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.770
 we do the same for the bottom 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.220
 the lid should look something like that then 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.420
 notice that here is like an edge 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.040
 thick that is this that she was 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.000
 pointing out that's where we're going to put 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.370
 silicon we take the corrugated cardboard and what 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.410
 we paste and that's all we have to 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:40.000
 do go putting glue around 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.000
 the lid and go sticking the cardboard 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.970
 and that's it, that's how your cover should look 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.530
 then let's let it dry 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.420
 while it dries we can take advantage of 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.750
 decorate and in this case I will use buttons 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.570
 and some slats 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.880
 then we will monitor if the lid is 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.600
 of the exact size and note that if it is the 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.420
 exact size 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.730
 So if you're good pro makes this of 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.460
 side let's take the colored strips 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.530
 and we're going to paste one over another to 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.070
 result we get a super ultra strip 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.070
 mega long 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:29.100
 then it will be like this ultra mega long 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.800
 then we are going to take one of your 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.260
 extremes and that's where we're going to start 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.760
 to write our letter I for this you 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.880
 I recommend that you use a dark color 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.340
 for each contrast and I recommend that you 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.900
 also be fine knit your feather in 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.900
 this case I will use a marker 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.830
 then if we want we can write of 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.840
 both sides by our letter so that 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.000
 be much better but in that case I 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.520
 I'm not going to do it, we're going to locate the 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.130
 end of our letter and then we go 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.949
 to take the bottle and that's where we're going 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.930
 to start inserting our letter to 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:10.520
 this step obviously the letter is going to go 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.919
 settling as the top 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.840
 then to prevent this from happening 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.970
 we are going to push the letter towards 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.280
 bottom part with a pencil so that 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.960
 fit a lot better than here do not you 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.110
 worry if it is all revolted that is 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.110
 the joke 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:29.159
 colour 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.190
 Well let's leave the letter 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.500
 approximately three or four 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:39.350
 free centimeters and we're going to mark there 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.940
 a doubles after we're going to insert everything 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:44.590
 what we want to insert 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.590
 diamond and stars 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:56.940
 then we stir and now we are going to take 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:58.680
 cover the insert and ready as 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.030
 you are your beautiful bottled letter the 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.460
 truth is that this letter is very original 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.840
 different from all the others and for sure 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.060
 He loves the person who is the 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.490
 I gave as a gift because besides 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.760
 all crazy has a different style to 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.760
 the others 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.710
 and that is the result now can 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.240
 give for any occasion I hope 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.099
