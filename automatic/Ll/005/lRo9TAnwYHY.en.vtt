00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
scissor lift that we made ourselves on

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.640 
scissor lift that we made ourselves on
the<00:00:25.769> CNC<00:00:26.550> machine<00:00:27.060> here<00:00:27.269> at<00:00:27.330> UCL<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:29.210> a

research<00:00:36.780> group<00:00:36.809> which<00:00:37.590> we<00:00:37.739> are<00:00:37.890> part<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.219> we

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
research group which we are part of we

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.630 
research group which we are part of we
stole<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.210> out<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.829> out<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.010> cabinets<00:00:41.460> here

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
stole it out of out of the cabinets here

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.750 
stole it out of out of the cabinets here
and<00:00:41.940> took<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.480> for<00:00:42.600> our<00:00:42.750> own<00:00:42.840> use<00:00:43.430> so<00:00:44.430> basically

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
and took it for our own use so basically

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.990 
and took it for our own use so basically
what<00:00:44.969> we<00:00:45.059> have<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.270> an<00:00:45.539> automatic<00:00:46.370> self<00:00:47.370> height

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
what we have is an automatic self height

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.850 
what we have is an automatic self height
adjusting<00:00:48.890> laser<00:00:50.300> staging<00:00:51.300> system<00:00:51.770> that<00:00:52.770> we

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
adjusting laser staging system that we

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.630 
adjusting laser staging system that we
made<00:00:53.039> for<00:00:53.280> PIV<00:00:53.579> experiments<00:00:55.160> and<00:00:56.160> what<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.520> do

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
made for PIV experiments and what you do

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.819 
made for PIV experiments and what you do
here<00:00:57.020> as<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.969> use<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.149> pad<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.840> enter<00:01:01.230> your

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
here as you use this pad to enter your

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.359 
here as you use this pad to enter your
desired<00:01:02.219> height<00:01:02.750> let's<00:01:03.750> say<00:01:04.049> we<00:01:04.650> want<00:01:04.920> 60

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
desired height let's say we want 60

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:13.130 
desired height let's say we want 60
centimeters<00:01:09.409> and<00:01:11.150> by<00:01:12.150> centimeters<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.840> really

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
centimeters and by centimeters I really

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.920 
centimeters and by centimeters I really
mean<00:01:13.260> millimeters<00:01:13.909> so<00:01:14.909> what's<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.720> program

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
mean millimeters so what's the program

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.560 
mean millimeters so what's the program
that<00:01:16.470> my<00:01:17.100> esteemed<00:01:17.820> colleague<00:01:18.360> Ronnie

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
that my esteemed colleague Ronnie

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.230 
that my esteemed colleague Ronnie
Worthen<00:01:18.930> has<00:01:19.080> written<00:01:19.290> does<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:20.090> check<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
Worthen has written does is check the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.160 
Worthen has written does is check the
height<00:01:22.280> of<00:01:23.280> our<00:01:23.490> caliper<00:01:23.850> versus<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.930> entered

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
height of our caliper versus the entered

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.130 
height of our caliper versus the entered
height<00:01:25.670> and<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:27.210> adjusts<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.840> linear

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
height and it adjusts the linear

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:38.480 
height and it adjusts the linear
actuator<00:01:28.290> inside<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:34.310> our<00:01:35.310> scissor<00:01:35.610> lift<00:01:37.490> to

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
actuator inside of our scissor lift to

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.300 
actuator inside of our scissor lift to
achieve<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.270> desired<00:01:39.630> height<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.259> if<00:01:41.220> you

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
achieve that desired height and if you

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.249 
achieve that desired height and if you
want<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.520> go<00:01:41.579> back<00:01:41.729> down<00:01:42.979> we<00:01:43.979> can<00:01:44.460> enter<00:01:44.939> say<00:01:45.720> 10

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
want to go back down we can enter say 10

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:54.899 
want to go back down we can enter say 10
millimeters<00:01:47.540> after<00:01:48.540> we<00:01:48.630> clear<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:51.710> and<00:01:52.939> enter

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
millimeters after we clear it and enter

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.539 
millimeters after we clear it and enter
and<00:01:55.000> what<00:01:55.659> it<00:01:55.780> does<00:01:55.960> is<00:01:56.200> check<00:01:57.039> these<00:01:57.280> values

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
and what it does is check these values

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.630 
and what it does is check these values
and<00:02:01.110> our<00:02:02.110> linear<00:02:02.439> actuator<00:02:02.680> and<00:02:03.189> scissor-lift

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
and our linear actuator and scissor-lift

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.380 
and our linear actuator and scissor-lift
increment<00:02:04.299> down<00:02:04.689> until<00:02:06.450> we<00:02:07.450> reach<00:02:09.390> 10

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
increment down until we reach 10

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.930 
increment down until we reach 10
centimeters<00:02:10.989> know<00:02:11.800> if<00:02:12.069> you<00:02:12.160> can<00:02:12.310> see<00:02:12.459> that<00:02:12.640> on

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
centimeters know if you can see that on

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.170 
centimeters know if you can see that on
the<00:02:13.030> video<00:02:14.340> but<00:02:15.340> that's<00:02:15.519> the<00:02:15.610> same<00:02:15.790> output

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
the video but that's the same output

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.660 
the video but that's the same output
here<00:02:16.360> and<00:02:18.720> we<00:02:19.720> have<00:02:19.840> success<00:02:20.200> this<00:02:21.069> was<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.370> lot

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
here and we have success this was a lot

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.520 
here and we have success this was a lot
of<00:02:21.700> hard<00:02:21.849> work<00:02:22.000> but<00:02:22.630> we<00:02:22.720> did<00:02:22.870> a<00:02:22.900> great<00:02:23.080> job<00:02:23.110> I

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
of hard work but we did a great job I

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.920 
of hard work but we did a great job I
think
