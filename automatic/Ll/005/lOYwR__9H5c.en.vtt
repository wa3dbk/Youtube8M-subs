00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.840
 make a real lipstick 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:22.630
 nourishing with an eye shadow that you will be 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.150
 surely it happened there broke or 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.920
 even from a palette that you don't 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.810
 use more than like a color a 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.349
 particular and I will show you precisely 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:35.679
 how to make a lipstick I chose 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:40.089
 a palette that I don't use with gods 

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:42.399
 colors of the containers for the lenses 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:46.269
 and it is simple containers for the ranti 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:50.010
 a transparent gloss a small brush with 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:54.969
 very long bristles especially for 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:59.190
 to be comfortable in mixing the 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:02.800
 everything is a nourishing cream or under 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.410
 turn my eyeshadow into an order 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.820
 lipstick of this color then the 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:11.730
 red 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:18.400
 I'm going to break the eyeshadow stick 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:22.740
 I'm going to break the brush and go 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:28.840
 to put on a kleenex we go to 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:30.420
 transfer in the talents in this 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.630
 way 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.610
 more eye shadow or pigment put the more 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.310
 color the color will naturally come 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.649
 intense these lipsticks naturally yes 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.020
 they can also do those with pigments 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:48.479
 who sell in powder perfumery 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:54.740
 let's add the lip gloss and 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:59.610
 a little bit of nourishing cream I go to 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:04.700
 mix it all you have to mix well 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:07.860
 until you reach the density 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.039
 just see the same creamy as 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.709
 a lipstick, your mind will make you 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:18.660
 see in this case on the palm of the 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:21.870
 my hand that has the same intensity e 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.420
 color of a normal lipstick could 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.310
 also be a gift idea to give away 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.950
 to a friend of yours of course with 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:33.230
 different containers 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.230
 it takes 5 to 10 minutes
