boot in our line it gets so light by
using<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.550> dynalite<00:00:24.029> EST<00:00:24.750> outsole<00:00:25.199> actually

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
using the dynalite EST outsole actually

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.820 
using the dynalite EST outsole actually
has<00:00:26.189> some<00:00:26.400> b3<00:00:26.910> cushioning<00:00:27.470> added<00:00:28.470> underneath

the<00:00:29.010> hill<00:00:29.189> just<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.580> absorb<00:00:29.970> any<00:00:30.150> hard

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
the hill just to absorb any hard

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
vibrations being an EST outsole it's

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.330 
vibrations being an EST outsole it's
going<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.660> pair<00:00:33.930> really<00:00:34.500> really<00:00:34.950> well<00:00:35.130> with

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
going to pair really really well with

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.319 
going to pair really really well with
the<00:00:35.880> EST<00:00:36.360> bindings<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.110> st<00:00:37.410> boards<00:00:38.329> just

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
really accentuating the board field that

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.240 
really accentuating the board field that
you<00:00:41.370> get<00:00:41.640> right<00:00:42.120> underfoot<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:43.020> nice<00:00:43.469> then<00:00:44.160> you

guys<00:00:44.430> be<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.700> zone<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:44.910> course<00:00:45.300> which<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.629> great

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
guys be a zone of course which is great

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.459 
guys be a zone of course which is great
for<00:00:45.870> convenience<00:00:46.500> yep<00:00:46.800> definitely<00:00:47.250> two<00:00:47.850> zones

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
for convenience yep definitely two zones

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.979 
for convenience yep definitely two zones
better<00:00:49.469> than<00:00:49.710> one<00:00:50.120> even<00:00:51.120> compared<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.600> laces

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
better than one even compared to laces

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.049 
better than one even compared to laces
you're<00:00:52.020> actually<00:00:52.920> getting<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.610> tighten<00:00:53.969> in

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
you're actually getting to tighten in

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.540 
you're actually getting to tighten in
both<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.750> lower<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.079> upper<00:00:55.550> independently

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
both the lower and upper independently

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.630 
both the lower and upper independently
that<00:00:57.120> also<00:00:57.420> keeps<00:00:57.600> some<00:00:57.809> more<00:00:57.989> consistent

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
that also keeps some more consistent

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.130 
that also keeps some more consistent
throughout<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.820> day<00:00:59.969> very<00:01:00.510> nice<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.020> then
