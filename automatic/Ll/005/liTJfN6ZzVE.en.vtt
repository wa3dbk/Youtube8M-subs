00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.220
 hello that such just all people like 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.170
 we are here like 50 since we are in 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.970
 a new video and today we have to go to 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.020
 fight on the battlefield with world 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.770
 star 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.810
 we have taken to walk the 29 tank 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.750
 gender only say 71 of the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.570
 best has 7 that we have in the world 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.329
 of tanks a very fun tank and very 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.380
 let's say easy to play it because no 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.899
 I need to play the guy 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.149
 Americans already know taking advantage of their 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.940
 hiding their advantages and their benefits 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.310
 advantages the turrets that has its good 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.870
 cannon and its advantages is hidden from 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.300
 as much chassis as possible so that the chassis 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.770
 It's soft and does not penetrate us 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.660
 get them let's say the rebounds 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.860
 timely in your turret provided by 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.750
 front by sides that gives taste 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.000
 have it good let's go here in the battle 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.530
 in the field of the west field this saying 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.530
 I 'm fine 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:17.640
 we remember that the t 29 is a tank 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:19.350
 quick to try to find that hill that 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.729
 you have to go find what we say 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.110
 the support of that wolf to hide 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.400
 our chassis 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.000
 and being able to make a single shot of the 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.500
 canyon using only the turret the 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.810
 politics does not give it for so much high that 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.160
 have those waters already had we go 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.420
 try to get here and we go less 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.520
 there we will go running for now 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.990
 the first part of that we will give 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.420
 a good punishment among all 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.700
 the first we remember that this canyon 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.600
 as we can see is a cannon of 105 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.870
 millimeters 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:51.030
 let's see if we look at 320 in standard bullet 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:54.410
 and 128 of penetration with which you have 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.210
 that is pretty good 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.860
 we have given two bullet impacts have given 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.960
 we already throw ourselves behind this slope and 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.119
 we are going to go with these little ones with 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.920
 a strike in the 25 to push that 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.210
 line try to break it to be able to 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.399
 attack from say by this line and 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.170
 break this white so we go for 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.540
 there are neither short nor lazy to the rhythm of 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.130
 39 is that yesterday is American as a 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.030
 bourgeois and the boy costs you ips 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.030
 of the ass and the pasta 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:25.690
 but finally you know I've noticed that 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.580
 fails a lot more pull this compound 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.950
 in the last patch that has corrected what 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.390
 which is the shots you see for the 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.010
 as far away as before 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.950
 waste the bullet I do not like it because 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.300
 there we have to located the other crime in 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.180
 claims that he ventured you from also to 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.310
 being American has a great depression 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.760
 in the canyon which offers us the 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.440
 very much possibility of this kind of 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.540
 the second eyes there are speak we give a 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.190
 little of his hundred and now we only have and 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.930
 is a softened ticket we have left there the 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.370
 kv 2 and 100 I 'll take care of the dining room 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.320
 if the workshop partner who is 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.990
 right handles his 100 the dining room 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.700
 sakai lines broken 80 thousand as there are 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.150
 we have broken this line and we are going to 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.150
 throw down 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.470
 we have said that we have finished america not 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.690
 let's do exercise that is already 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.120
 because this milk that moves and now 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.270
 is going to start shooting here you see not what 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.620
 we see we are not going to get shots 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.600
 we are the first there we have the bounce 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.820
 the correct one and it's a 25 that's hidden 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.380
 over there but I'll try to move 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.850
 little the tank so at least 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.040
 retired and fails the second when moving 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.660
 we discovered there and as you see what 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.430
 it said before it did not close well the reticle of 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.600
 shots and goes the shot takes by sack 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.670
 really 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.720
 that affect a shot in a hostel now 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.720
 long distance at least 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:49.150
 this friend had to choose analices 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.670
 explains that it is aggravated to look at the shot 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.080
 what I do 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:09.030
 for the truth 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:11.340
 this has been the basis with which there is 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.370
 each base less bad that this time we're 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.540
 the part of 8.788 located now is worth the 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.890
 starting pretty even as you can 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.940
 see well fought we have very written 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.530
 Of damage 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.420
 we carry six tanks five tanks 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.280
 headings of an entire element with 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.900
 different impacts we will not go to 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.210
 defend the base and something else that also 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.090
 I usually do and what proof is the car in 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.620
 the car that is useful to me if 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.530
 your enemy 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.980
 is standing even though you are but 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:46.500
 moving up there all this 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:49.350
 now remember that you do not have to do anything 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.500
 but that does not work well when the 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.480
 still enemy and you 300 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.710
 us but yes according to the enemy in the 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.900
 time especially as the 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.090
 distance is content to use it that man 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.650
 The type of tank also depends 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.970
 its little but good that more or less 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:09.240
 works this way equally for all the 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:11.669
 precision is the precision of 0.2 do 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.139
 the exercise to 29 to see if we leave it 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.139
 between 28 27 

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:20.850
 the power that can caches the 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.350
 chicken we are not going to cross here the 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:27.210
 aqueduct the aqueduct of field the west 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:32.220
 and there are only four enemies left 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:34.260
 give you a mx 12 a gel cut and 125 is worth the 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.690
 rescue is there or in front of the left 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.970
 and the future hill the 25 us human 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.710
 around here on the right up we're not going 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.780
 to see but yes we look at the 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.979
 minimapa we are going to meet with him 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:48.539
 ame x 12 t that was trolling 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:50.280
 meters there we will be painted on 25 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:52.650
 when he began to raise punishment already 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:56.660
 one of the iese arrived 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:06:02.920
 he gets in combat with him 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:05.140
 from behind with him 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.190
 sometimes sorry with coughing until 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.510
 be careful with the sevens and 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:10.030
 true milestones chronic because no 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.380
 you know well that humidity does not affect 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.800
 very much and in galicia because as 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:16.800
 you will understand then it is something complicated 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.800
 very much 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:30.970
 but as it follows it is good because 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:33.870
 when we separate we recharge how it acts and 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.870
 we shoot 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.670
 it is much more effective eye is not 100% 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.080
 reliable is much more effective when the 

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:44.190
 enemy is stopped even though you 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.190
 you move not the opposite 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:55.650
 now the artillery share it and we 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.650
 we see in the next video see you later
