00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.620
 has unleashed in Brazil that is a downturn in 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.990
 this beach is not there we are seeing the 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.139
 images of these people that turned out 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.589
 severely affected the hundreds of 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.090
 bathers of those who walked through the 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:18.920
 boulevard the boardwalk today we are seeing 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.530
 these impressive images of 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.100
 They take everything literally communicate well 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.960
 It's on the beach of piety in Brazil where 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.780
 literally they went flying by this 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.029
 number of holiday makers even 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:35.420
 appreciate how the palms are shaken 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.340
 but nothing the way but incredible in the 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.950
 that in addition to the person who has captured 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.200
 this image is located so 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.630
 strategic from above and has been able 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.060
 record knowing a problem all the 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.579
 details of the panic not of the terror of the 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.170
 minutes of terror that I imagine must 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.390
 have lived all these people who 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.140
 they had gone to this beach of piety in 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.740
 graz and consumption of beaches plus the 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.010
 visited visited 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:06.490
 the area apparently the one that recorded the 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.710
 video has been located in a building 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.060
 a recreational center a pool 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.460
 It looks like it's a pretty tour area and 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.380
 in front of the pier not in front of it 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.450
 beach and really awesome what 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.570
 could already record several meters 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.210
 distance the cries of the people this 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.120
 operation of trying to hear people come out 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.430
 obviously shocked at the fury of 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.920
 nature and they are also appreciated as 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.440
 several these branches or leaves of these 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.100
 palm trees that can fly and several 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.100
 undertake 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.640
 the leaves of the palm tree look like 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.340
 like the whole tree is going to come out 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.760
 fired in seconds now all these 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.760
 people 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.810
 meteorologists had not warned that 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.960
 something like that could happen like that is that's what 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.760
 that we are going to be aware of 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.310
 in the next few minutes about this 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.350
 situation that was lived on this beach 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.960
 Brazilian look nothing else that does not form 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:09.990
 this spiral do not stop strong wind 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.990
