00:00:01.339 --> 00:00:04.339
 or that she to finish our cox exercise of 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.420
 the stroller 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.229
 We love you to give you the last details 

00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:11.190
 and in this case I'm not going to sit down 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.489
 these two vertices as such 

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:16.489
 and I'm going to lower it a little 

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:19.929
 read would also be good 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:22.419
 Selected 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:25.089
 all this here 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:26.249
 equally 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:29.119
 jesus del campo 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.189
 and scale the inwards 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.830
 rise x pluton 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.280
 we put a barletta the rounded shape once 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.270
 of the car as such 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.470
 months one of these lines also 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.770
 and we will be the same 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.990
 the change of beckham as of times 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.770
 scaled nx a little bit inside 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.290
 and ready these so that it is not so 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.280
 by the way so straight the structure we see that the back part we are also in 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.170
 the straight 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.620
 so let's see 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.620
 fix this was injured in this way the 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.230
 x changed the vertex mode 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.230
 deluded kahlo about the kiss 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.140
 thus 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.120
 very exceptional cd even his two 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.680
 we think they are good 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.360
 okey and SME companies 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.400
 by basic arrangements 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.780
 some cars one has fenders other cars not in this case egg already 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.650
 enter such a level of detail 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.380
 I do not think it's necessary, but if they do, they could also 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.690
 work a little 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.340
 the part the fenders 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.780
 for that then there is a little more information 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.230
 for example month we had 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.670
 percent 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.890
 now yes you select these these lines 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.100
 It is not a preserve in two 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.470
 consume them 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.630
 and then 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.270
 select this with the west 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.370
 and the same 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.290
 yes with this style themselves 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.970
 we see that we are getting small each triangular nothing happens there is no 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.640
 world and many problems really 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.770
 while you handle your polygonal faces are four and three faces 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.670
 do not see any problem if the faces are more than four faces thing of five 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.020
 masks then yes we are going to have problems so that yes they are not 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.269
 I recommend 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.239
 He said we have not changed late 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.459
 correct a bit on this side 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.789
 wessels one of these lines as such 

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:27.739
 the mules 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.769
 now we act separately 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.549
 bosh injured this from here 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.099
 I'm going to give you coppola give you three 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.089
 I disconnect 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:40.179
 Luisa Merlo in Zeta 

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:41.639
 to separate them 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:44.639
 little grosso of what would be the splash something like this 

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:48.539
 and then what I'm going to do in this case is 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:52.189
 let's join this one 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:54.510
 consume is there they are 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.509
 we are not humble pesos here 

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:59.509
 walsh side 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:07.509
 then that one with this one 

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:10.509
 something like that 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:13.419
 we maintain the structure 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:16.419
 and then here's his exceptional these two 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.529
 on your side 

00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:21.529
 and I'm going to give them a preserve of two 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:25.409
 the kosher now simply selected 

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:31.359
 These points 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:32.329
 to join them 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.259
 and create what sells but a way to 

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:36.699
 the fender 

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:39.699
 equally on this side like we need something similar 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:41.970
 so I'm going to sanction 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.239
 all those of quito 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.699
 Always try to ensure that the steps are continuous 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:49.799
 a disgust 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:50.620
 two 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.549
 he connected 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.119
 this one and this one 

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:58.289
 the un a little bit away so with humor the 

00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:00.259
 inward 

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:02.529
 maybe a little 

00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:03.829
 or low 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.039
 it turned more out 

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:08.629
 and now it is extra 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:10.709
 partying 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.519
 We now have the necessary information to get it out 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.319
 fenders 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:17.509
 select these two 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:20.499
 and I'm going to lower them a little more 

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:22.870
 in this way 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.710
 since this one does 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.710
 so it can be in this case selected 

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:33.949
 these faces 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:37.159
 what are we going to work with 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:39.499
 and we have the chance 

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:42.300
 to make them our prison 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.460
 by the way 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.460
 It is not the first one and then the other because there are no problems 

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:49.490
 side clubs because they were destroyed 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.779
 in zeta 

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:53.169
 a little bit was not too much 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.159
 even this was 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:58.159
 and return it 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.979
 this side can be the same 

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:08.050
 I'm going to be the studio 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.050
 prison 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:16.139
 Yes a lot 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.680
 it's not just a little 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.469
 and in that way 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:23.210
 and the only thing that would be missing now is 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.819
 You can select these vineyards from here 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:28.819
 as such 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.550
 julia 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.669
 they go down a little 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.110
 p - now that that form 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.229
 you can injure 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:42.379
 these vertices 

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:45.370
 what you can not is new 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.370
 these purposes 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:52.229
 iniesta 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:53.740
 the bongoes 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.740
 doing a little 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.319
 because 

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:03.319
 and this also moves it inward 

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:06.469
 the goal is 

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:08.520
 with this 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.249
 mockus is clear 

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:14.619
 york lights and stratum d round up a little what is long 

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:18.300
 the shape does not splash in front 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.919
 that they know it straight 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:21.409
 in this way 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:23.490
 and with this, basically 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.490
 we finished our little success 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.610
 Of course, it's not a world 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.749
 it's not such a perfect model 

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:32.139
 works 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:33.550
 here we have it 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.819
 is a model that has few polygons not too many 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.820
 to equate the tires just each gift after about four 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.210
 cylinders and 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:44.969
 simply that is all 

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:47.569
 what I do not expect with this lesson 

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:48.860
 this little one 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.969
 quick tutorial modeling with 

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:55.349
 the whiskey and then they understand a little the process of how the program works and 

00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:58.029
 also you have the ability to be able 

00:06:58.029 --> 00:06:58.759
 percent 

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:00.840
 models from cubes 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.369
 they must that is a pretty simple way 

00:07:03.369 --> 00:07:06.879
 you have to work a little bit of xterra while it's not so easy at first 

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:08.969
 time but with a little practice surely 

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:10.520
 they will not have any problem 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.719
 although good that's all we'll see another time for other injuries
