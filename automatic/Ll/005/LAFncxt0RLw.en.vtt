as a mechanical guide typically our
beautiful<00:02:12.780> work<00:02:12.960> or<00:02:13.230> what<00:02:13.380> we<00:02:13.500> think<00:02:13.530> is

beautiful work gets covered up by a

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.990 
beautiful work gets covered up by a
ceiling<00:02:15.450> so<00:02:15.750> we<00:02:16.710> we<00:02:17.250> like<00:02:17.430> having<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:17.880> out

the outside will there be any natural
light<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.190> that<00:02:29.730> was<00:02:29.850> so<00:02:30.000> funny<00:02:30.210> because<00:02:30.360> no

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
light and that was so funny because no

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.390 
light and that was so funny because no
matter<00:02:30.750> where<00:02:31.170> where<00:02:31.620> they<00:02:31.830> were<00:02:31.890> at<00:02:32.130> in<00:02:32.310> the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
matter where where they were at in the

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.130 
matter where where they were at in the
diverse<00:02:32.640> organization<00:02:33.360> they<00:02:33.480> kept<00:02:33.750> asking

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
diverse organization they kept asking

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.140 
diverse organization they kept asking
that<00:02:34.230> same<00:02:34.440> question<00:02:34.500> so<00:02:35.160> we<00:02:35.610> looked<00:02:35.820> at<00:02:36.000> is

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
that same question so we looked at is

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.090 
that same question so we looked at is
this<00:02:36.330> is<00:02:36.480> high<00:02:36.660> base<00:02:36.900> space<00:02:37.230> it's<00:02:37.620> got<00:02:37.830> these

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
this is high base space it's got these

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.130 
this is high base space it's got these
skylights<00:02:38.850> that<00:02:39.360> we've<00:02:39.480> put<00:02:39.690> in<00:02:39.780> some<00:02:39.990> high

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
skylights that we've put in some high

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.960 
skylights that we've put in some high
performance<00:02:40.200> we<00:02:41.130> took<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.400> old<00:02:41.430> roll-up

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
performance we took the old roll-up

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.460 
performance we took the old roll-up
doors<00:02:42.240> and<00:02:42.480> actually<00:02:42.720> replaced<00:02:43.080> that<00:02:43.260> with

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
doors and actually replaced that with

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.830 
doors and actually replaced that with
glass<00:02:43.800> so<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:44.520> really<00:02:44.790> kind<00:02:45.030> of<00:02:45.180> created<00:02:45.690> those

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
glass so it really kind of created those

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.810 
glass so it really kind of created those
connections<00:02:46.440> but<00:02:46.860> we<00:02:47.010> had<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.310> have<00:02:47.430> private

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
connections but we had to have private

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.040 
connections but we had to have private
offices<00:02:47.910> we<00:02:48.270> were<00:02:48.330> able<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.540> completely

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
offices we were able to completely

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.540 
offices we were able to completely
skimming<00:02:49.620> glass<00:02:49.830> so<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.160> could<00:02:50.340> see

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
skimming glass so you could see

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.610 
skimming glass so you could see
throughout<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.120> entire<00:02:51.450> space<00:02:51.810> so<00:02:52.320> it<00:02:52.410> really

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
throughout the entire space so it really

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.930 
throughout the entire space so it really
kind<00:02:52.800> of<00:02:52.830> took<00:02:52.980> some<00:02:53.190> of<00:02:53.280> those<00:02:53.370> traditional

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
kind of took some of those traditional

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.000 
kind of took some of those traditional
barriers<00:02:54.420> that<00:02:54.900> really<00:02:55.140> separate<00:02:55.650> or<00:02:55.830> kind<00:02:55.980> of

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
barriers that really separate or kind of

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.830 
barriers that really separate or kind of
break<00:02:56.250> down<00:02:56.280> collaborative<00:02:57.090> efforts<00:02:57.420> and

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
break down collaborative efforts and

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.449 
break down collaborative efforts and
really<00:02:58.050> opened<00:02:58.470> that<00:02:58.680> up<00:02:58.740> and<00:02:59.010> really<00:02:59.220> kind<00:02:59.400> of

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
really opened that up and really kind of

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.340 
really opened that up and really kind of
gave<00:02:59.580> everybody<00:02:59.940> that<00:03:00.270> equal<00:03:00.720> kind<00:03:01.050> of<00:03:01.110> space

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
gave everybody that equal kind of space

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.230 
gave everybody that equal kind of space
to<00:03:01.590> views<00:03:02.070> and<00:03:02.400> naturally<00:03:02.850> what<00:03:03.209> I

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
to views and naturally what I

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.360 
to views and naturally what I
particularly<00:03:03.630> like<00:03:03.870> is<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.470> way<00:03:04.590> we<00:03:04.770> we<00:03:05.070> built
