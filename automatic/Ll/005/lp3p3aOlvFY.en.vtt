00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
that you can forget or remember yourself

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.440 
that you can forget or remember yourself
you're<00:00:11.160> always<00:00:11.519> yourself<00:00:13.639> but<00:00:14.639> when<00:00:14.910> we<00:00:15.089> start

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
you're always yourself but when we start

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.640 
you're always yourself but when we start
to<00:00:15.660> have<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:16.199> think<00:00:17.420> you<00:00:18.420> you<00:00:18.840> think<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.500> are

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
to have to think you you think you are

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.519 
to have to think you you think you are
an<00:00:19.920> individual<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.789> that<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:21.689> have<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.230> do

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
an individual and that you have to do

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.620 
an individual and that you have to do
something<00:00:22.980> after<00:00:23.100> practice<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.880> get<00:00:24.060> back<00:00:24.390> to

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
something after practice to get back to

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.890 
something after practice to get back to
where<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:24.840> are<00:00:25.140> all<00:00:25.380> these<00:00:25.650> are<00:00:25.920> concepts<00:00:29.900> you

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
where you are all these are concepts you

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.049 
where you are all these are concepts you
are<00:00:30.929> not<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.260> concept<00:00:34.399> you<00:00:35.399> are<00:00:35.430> earlier<00:00:35.850> than

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
are not a concept you are earlier than

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.930 
are not a concept you are earlier than
all<00:00:36.300> concepts<00:00:37.190> because<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.370> are<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.610> witness

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
all concepts because you are the witness

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.580 
all concepts because you are the witness
of<00:00:39.059> them<00:00:40.430> but<00:00:41.430> we<00:00:41.579> have<00:00:41.700> an<00:00:41.850> idea<00:00:42.440> that<00:00:43.440> we

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
of them but we have an idea that we

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.330 
of them but we have an idea that we
forget<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.250> in<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.969> play<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.629> existence

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
forget and in the play of existence

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.569 
forget and in the play of existence
because<00:00:47.340> we<00:00:48.000> are<00:00:48.120> functioning<00:00:48.480> as<00:00:49.579> individual

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
because we are functioning as individual

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.850 
because we are functioning as individual
entities<00:00:50.760> on<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.420> journey<00:00:52.129> towards<00:00:53.539> awakening

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
entities on a journey towards awakening

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:02.119 
entities on a journey towards awakening
this<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:56.070> also<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.520> concept<00:00:59.149> but<00:01:00.500> very<00:01:01.500> few<00:01:01.859> are

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
this is also a concept but very few are

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.260 
this is also a concept but very few are
going<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.550> get<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:03.030> what<00:01:03.270> I'm<00:01:03.420> speaking

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
going to get this what I'm speaking

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.800 
going to get this what I'm speaking
nevertheless<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.780> has<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.260> be<00:01:07.350> said<00:01:07.590> very<00:01:08.810> few

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
nevertheless it has to be said very few

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.969 
nevertheless it has to be said very few
is<00:01:10.260> going<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.530> get<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.890> because<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.900> is<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.290> deep

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
is going to get it because it is so deep

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.510 
is going to get it because it is so deep
rooted<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.520> us<00:01:15.560> that<00:01:16.560> we<00:01:16.619> are<00:01:16.830> not<00:01:16.950> yet<00:01:17.340> that

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.490 

she<00:01:20.520> understands<00:01:21.119> what<00:01:21.240> I'm<00:01:21.420> speaking<00:01:24.200> and<00:01:25.200> so

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
she understands what I'm speaking and so

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.700 
she understands what I'm speaking and so
altogether<00:01:26.130> we<00:01:26.759> are<00:01:26.970> believing<00:01:29.659> altogether

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
altogether we are believing altogether

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.770 
altogether we are believing altogether
we<00:01:31.710> are<00:01:31.799> believing<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.780> collective

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
we are believing a collective

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.130 
we are believing a collective
consciousness<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.680> we<00:01:35.430> are<00:01:35.460> not<00:01:35.990> what<00:01:36.990> we

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
consciousness that we are not what we

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.469 
consciousness that we are not what we
are<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:38.689> because<00:01:39.689> we<00:01:39.869> believe<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:41.060> we<00:01:42.060> have<00:01:42.299> to
