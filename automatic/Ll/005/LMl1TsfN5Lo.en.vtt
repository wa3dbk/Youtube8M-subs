00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.330
 Hello all good by category 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.090
 news one rather large store 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.370
 electronics in Omsk gave a positive 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.410
 response to my suggestion to write 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.310
 sharing video about computer for 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.560
 the photographer 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.470
 wrote the technical director himself said 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.900
 that this is an interesting idea that for them it 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.359
 good pr move and they won't help 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.970
 so here it is important to knock on all doors 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.940
 somewhere and you will open now we decide 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.950
 minor organizational matters there time 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.110
 records who will say that we will 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.719
 talk but i also asked to do 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.719
 option budget so the computer itself by 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.500
 currently was inexpensive it is not a computer for 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.079
 gamer 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.820
 these are photo processing computers 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.739
 I hope that the price will be quite 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.649
 acceptable they can do 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.350
 jointly quite interesting 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.000
 video here so important to ask important 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.430
 go ahead and don't give up 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.129
 as described in many shops and 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.250
 only one gave a good positive 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.260
 I thank you very much for the answer 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.689
 there will be an advertisement from my blog 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.150
 if we still make this video and they 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.490
 don't forget about your answer don't think 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.860
 that they will not forget I will survive the stream 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.720
 alexander balov he's very interesting 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.420
 about volume chic stream 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.909
 there just were different rolls different 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.439
 there is a window switch it all think 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.560
 it is worth cutting and shortening a little 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.960
 Stream material from Sasha I will leave the whole 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.180
 he just thank you so much chic 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.729
 the material looked just on one 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.350
 breathing unit moves to a new level 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.720
 on color correction 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.060
 again thanks to alexander ambals 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.000
 yesterday dismantled cooler dismantled 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.100
 color combination color scheme 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.470
 examples that I looked on the internet 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.680
 now you understand how important 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.890
 choose not only the background not only makeup 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.360
 but also the color of the clothes so that all colors 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.700
 looked together and organized 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.680
 any color scheme is extremely 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.079
 extremely important and it raises your 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.630
 photo to a new level plus 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.270
 processing plus cooler photoshop 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.289
 plus all these tools that us still 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.379
 teach alexand 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.780
 Ambalov Natalia importantly will make guest 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:17.879
 write about the average format and write 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.870
 more often in a personal message 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:24.209

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.409

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:30.810
 the retoucher from Kharkov is visiting 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:32.909
 an invitation from a photo studio 2d Katya money 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.980
 she will soon come to me now 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:37.739
 worried because it should come here with 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.560
 minute to minute and i'm afraid that she 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.260
 cut off the video recording and so interesting 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.480
 in general for an hour we will come to roast fry 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.370
 already recorded an interview with her studio 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.879
 good girl she will pass yet 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.769
 master class in Omsk if you're interested 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:55.409
 come and search for interior 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.909
 understand all the scenes all the amounts they 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:59.280
 relative ie for example 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:01.680
 photo session in Omsk is well there and a half 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.959
 thousand rubles or 2000 rubles but 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.169
 maximum can be 3 and interior but 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.269
 costs there from 500 to 1000 I think the same 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:12.030
 most in Moscow if Moscow photo session 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.189
 worth for example u don't know 200 dollars 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.709
 300 dollars there cheers shob they know 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:17.280
 full ladies about 10,000 rubles so much 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.590
 session 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.199
 for example they donâ€™t know an hour 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.590
 amounts then interior rent is basically in 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:28.440
 this money you can find it is equal to 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.049
 strong single everyone wants to make money 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.720
 and you can use cafe interiors 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:36.900
 places either early in the morning or vice versa 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.440
 late in the evening or in the most so deaf 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.099
 clock 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.690
 that is, there is always a way out Well in 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.859
