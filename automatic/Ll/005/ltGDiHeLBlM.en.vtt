this rubber grommet here and there's two

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.779 
this rubber grommet here and there's two
screws<00:00:24.539> there's<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.500> seven<00:00:26.039> millimeter<00:00:26.430> screw

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
screws there's a seven millimeter screw

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.490 
screws there's a seven millimeter screw
that<00:00:26.910> goes<00:00:27.119> in<00:00:27.330> right<00:00:27.480> by<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:27.840> turn<00:00:28.080> signal

holding<00:02:47.020> it<00:02:47.610> this<00:02:48.610> is<00:02:48.760> bracket<00:02:49.330> that's<00:02:49.510> right

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
holding it this is bracket that's right

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.600 
holding it this is bracket that's right
up<00:02:49.930> in<00:02:50.140> underneath<00:02:50.680> there<00:02:51.010> so<00:02:51.280> I<00:02:51.340> already

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
up in underneath there so I already

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.090 
up in underneath there so I already
disassembled<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.480> screw<00:02:52.810> on<00:02:53.850> this<00:02:54.850> one<00:02:56.100> just

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
disassembled the screw on this one just

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.970 
disassembled the screw on this one just
taking<00:02:57.430> apart<00:02:57.670> so<00:02:57.910> what<00:02:58.030> you<00:02:58.150> do<00:02:58.300> is<00:02:58.390> you<00:02:58.480> just

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
taking apart so what you do is you just

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.490 
taking apart so what you do is you just
pop<00:02:59.980> it<00:03:00.160> out<00:03:00.250> of<00:03:00.310> there<00:03:00.610> I<00:03:01.080> find<00:03:02.080> you<00:03:02.200> kind<00:03:02.440> of

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
pop it out of there I find you kind of

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.040 
pop it out of there I find you kind of
gotta<00:03:02.710> actually<00:03:03.130> lift<00:03:04.060> this<00:03:04.240> up<00:03:04.510> a<00:03:04.630> little<00:03:04.750> bit

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
gotta actually lift this up a little bit

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.500 
gotta actually lift this up a little bit
and<00:03:05.530> then<00:03:06.190> slide<00:03:06.520> it<00:03:06.700> out<00:03:06.790> as<00:03:07.030> you<00:03:07.150> can<00:03:07.300> see

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
and then slide it out as you can see

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.470 
and then slide it out as you can see
it's<00:03:07.980> kind<00:03:08.980> of<00:03:09.010> got<00:03:09.130> a<00:03:09.160> groove<00:03:09.490> slides<00:03:10.210> into

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
it's kind of got a groove slides into

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.290 
it's kind of got a groove slides into
there<00:03:10.660> so<00:03:11.400> that's<00:03:12.400> basically<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.150> easiest

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
there so that's basically the easiest

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.760 
there so that's basically the easiest
way<00:03:13.570> I<00:03:13.600> found<00:03:13.840> to<00:03:13.960> take<00:03:14.140> them<00:03:14.290> apart<00:03:14.380> pretty

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
way I found to take them apart pretty

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.650 
way I found to take them apart pretty
quick<00:03:15.100> and<00:03:15.250> simple<00:03:15.430> now<00:03:16.090> you're<00:03:16.240> ready<00:03:16.390> to<00:03:16.480> do

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
quick and simple now you're ready to do

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.640 
quick and simple now you're ready to do
the<00:03:16.780> rest<00:03:16.960> of<00:03:17.020> your<00:03:17.170> retrofit<00:03:17.680> Thanks
