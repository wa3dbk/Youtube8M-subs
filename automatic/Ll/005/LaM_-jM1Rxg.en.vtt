going to set up what is known as a
repeater

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
repeater

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.680 
repeater
all<00:00:43.350> right<00:00:43.620> now<00:00:44.040> Malou<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.399> outside<00:00:45.030> on<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
all right now Malou is outside on the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.500 
all right now Malou is outside on the
patio<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.410> she<00:00:46.829> can't<00:00:47.100> get<00:00:47.250> any<00:00:47.460> signal<00:00:48.059> from

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
patio and she can't get any signal from

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.569 
patio and she can't get any signal from
our<00:00:48.719> router<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.230> we<00:00:49.350> set<00:00:49.590> up<00:00:49.620> already<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.219> went

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
our router that we set up already I went

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.220 
our router that we set up already I went
out<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.789> car<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.210> got<00:00:51.390> another<00:00:51.719> router<00:00:51.960> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
out to the car I got another router the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.580 
out to the car I got another router the
exact<00:00:52.530> same<00:00:52.680> model<00:00:53.039> it's<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.250> Netgear<00:00:53.730> wnr<00:00:54.590> 3500

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
exact same model it's a Netgear wnr 3500

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.650 
exact same model it's a Netgear wnr 3500
and<00:00:55.739> i'm<00:00:56.100> gonna<00:00:56.309> set<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:56.699> up<00:00:56.760> as<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.120> repeater

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
and i'm gonna set this up as a repeater

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.229 
and i'm gonna set this up as a repeater
so<00:00:57.899> it's<00:00:58.050> going<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.289> grab<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:59.219> signal<00:00:59.640> from

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
so it's going to grab the signal from

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.119 
so it's going to grab the signal from
our<00:01:00.420> receiver<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.230> gonna<00:01:01.379> extend<00:01:01.800> the

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
our receiver and it's gonna extend the

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.500 
our receiver and it's gonna extend the
network<00:01:02.280> all<00:01:02.640> right<00:01:02.760> so<00:01:02.910> I'll<00:01:02.969> set<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.180> up

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
network all right so I'll set it up

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.969 
network all right so I'll set it up
somewhere<00:01:03.930> else<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.229> house<00:01:04.439> where<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:04.890> can

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
somewhere else in the house where I can

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.310 
somewhere else in the house where I can
still<00:01:05.250> get<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.729> signal<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.299> then<00:01:06.750> extend<00:01:07.229> it

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
still get the signal and then extend it

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.350 
still get the signal and then extend it
which<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.619> great<00:01:07.770> all<00:01:08.310> right<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:08.580> I've<00:01:08.700> unboxed

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
which is great all right so I've unboxed

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.030 
which is great all right so I've unboxed
it<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.540> course<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:10.110> need<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.409> plug<00:01:10.619> in<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.770> power

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
it of course I need to plug in the power

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.060 
it of course I need to plug in the power
which<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.760> down<00:01:12.390> here<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:15.619> to<00:01:16.619> let<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.860> know

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
which is down here and to let you know

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.969 
which is down here and to let you know
our<00:01:17.689> router<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.869> now<00:01:18.990> going<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.170> become<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.619> base

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
our router is now going to become a base

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.190 
our router is now going to become a base
that's<00:01:20.340> gonna<00:01:20.490> speak<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.880> our<00:01:21.299> repeater<00:01:21.930> all

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
that's gonna speak to our repeater all

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.700 
that's gonna speak to our repeater all
right

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
right

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.859 
right
the<00:01:23.070> router<00:01:23.310> still<00:01:23.670> functions<00:01:24.180> like<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.420> normal

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
the router still functions like a normal

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.330 
the router still functions like a normal
router<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.259> we<00:01:25.380> set<00:01:25.619> up<00:01:25.650> all<00:01:25.979> right<00:01:26.130> it's

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
router that we set up all right it's

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.130 
router that we set up all right it's
gonna<00:01:26.460> have<00:01:26.759> our<00:01:26.970> signal<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.750> goes<00:01:27.900> out

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
gonna have our signal and it goes out

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.140 
gonna have our signal and it goes out
but<00:01:28.560> it's<00:01:28.710> got<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.890> limited<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.549> distance<00:01:29.970> that

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
but it's got a limited of distance that

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.880 
but it's got a limited of distance that
the<00:01:30.390> strength<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.020> signal<00:01:31.200> can<00:01:31.470> go<00:01:31.650> all

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
the strength of the signal can go all

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.469 
the strength of the signal can go all
right<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.310> if<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.610> happens<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.090> have<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.270> big

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
right and if that happens you have a big

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.359 
right and if that happens you have a big
house<00:01:33.659> like<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.079> Smiths<00:01:34.350> do<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:35.009> need<00:01:35.189> the

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
house like the Smiths do you need the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.760 
house like the Smiths do you need the
repeater<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:36.030> grab<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.869> original<00:01:37.229> signal<00:01:37.409> and

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
repeater to grab the original signal and

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.319 
repeater to grab the original signal and
then<00:01:37.979> extend<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.490> all<00:01:38.640> right<00:01:38.909> now<00:01:38.939> if<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.210> have

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
then extend it all right now if you have

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.789 
then extend it all right now if you have
an<00:01:39.420> apartment<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:40.020> probably<00:01:40.350> don't<00:01:40.560> need<00:01:40.740> to

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
an apartment you probably don't need to

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.039 
an apartment you probably don't need to
do<00:01:41.009> this<00:01:41.329> another<00:01:42.329> thing<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.659> need<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.899> know

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
do this another thing you need to know

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.190 
do this another thing you need to know
you<00:01:43.710> need<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:44.070> reconnect<00:01:44.700> with<00:01:45.000> an<00:01:45.689> Ethernet

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
you need to reconnect with an Ethernet

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.020 
you need to reconnect with an Ethernet

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
you have a wireless PC you need to do

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.190 
you have a wireless PC you need to do
this<00:01:53.909> because<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.390> might<00:01:54.540> not<00:01:54.750> have<00:01:54.960> your

this because you might not have your

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.499 
this because you might not have your
Ethernet<00:01:55.649> cable<00:01:55.790> connected<00:01:56.790> anymore<00:01:57.180> because

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
you need to name your network all right

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.890 
you need to name your network all right
ours<00:02:38.540> is<00:02:38.840> a<00:02:39.850> po1<00:02:40.850> if<00:02:41.450> you<00:02:41.510> remember<00:02:41.780> from

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
ours is a po1 if you remember from

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.340 
ours is a po1 if you remember from
earlier<00:02:42.110> and<00:02:42.620> then<00:02:42.980> it'll<00:02:43.520> say<00:02:43.670> mode<00:02:44.390> and<00:02:44.750> this

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
earlier and then it'll say mode and this

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.500 
earlier and then it'll say mode and this
is<00:02:45.530> how<00:02:46.040> many<00:02:46.220> bits<00:02:46.310> that<00:02:46.880> you<00:02:47.000> can<00:02:47.150> get<00:02:47.300> per

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
is how many bits that you can get per

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.300 
is how many bits that you can get per
second<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.050> so<00:02:48.140> we're<00:02:48.290> gonna<00:02:48.350> go<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:49.040> max

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
second and so we're gonna go the max

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.199 
second and so we're gonna go the max
which<00:02:49.550> is<00:02:49.700> up<00:02:49.910> to<00:02:49.940> 300<00:02:50.570> Mbps<00:02:51.410> megabits<00:02:52.220> per

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
which is up to 300 Mbps megabits per

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.300 
which is up to 300 Mbps megabits per
second<00:02:53.690> alright<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:54.200> now<00:02:54.560> it's<00:02:54.739> asking<00:02:55.070> about

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
second alright and now it's asking about

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.880 
second alright and now it's asking about
security<00:02:55.489> options<00:02:56.180> now<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:56.870> first<00:02:57.380> option<00:02:57.830> is

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
security options now the first option is

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.199 
security options now the first option is
none<00:02:58.160> which<00:02:58.370> is<00:02:58.489> what<00:02:58.640> we're<00:02:58.790> going<00:02:58.940> to<00:02:58.970> choose

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
none which is what we're going to choose

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.210 
none which is what we're going to choose
just<00:02:59.510> for<00:02:59.660> the<00:02:59.750> ease<00:02:59.900> of<00:02:59.930> setup<00:03:00.440> process<00:03:00.739> so

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
just for the ease of setup process so

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.949 
just for the ease of setup process so
the<00:03:01.310> highest<00:03:01.459> form<00:03:01.790> of<00:03:01.910> security<00:03:02.390> you<00:03:02.510> can<00:03:02.690> use

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
the highest form of security you can use

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.290 
the highest form of security you can use
for<00:03:03.320> the<00:03:03.470> base<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:03.739> a<00:03:04.010> repeater<00:03:04.400> is<00:03:04.670> WEP<00:03:05.090> or

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
for the base and a repeater is WEP or

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.260 
for the base and a repeater is WEP or
WEP<00:03:05.780> all<00:03:06.770> right<00:03:07.010> now<00:03:07.430> we<00:03:07.489> talked<00:03:07.760> about<00:03:07.880> that

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
WEP all right now we talked about that

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.600 
WEP all right now we talked about that
as<00:03:08.600> being<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.440> weakest<00:03:09.860> of<00:03:10.040> security<00:03:10.459> but

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
as being the weakest of security but

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.190 
as being the weakest of security but
that's<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.150> best<00:03:11.300> option<00:03:11.540> we<00:03:11.810> have<00:03:11.959> right<00:03:12.170> now

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
that's the best option we have right now

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.620 
that's the best option we have right now
so<00:03:12.739> if<00:03:12.830> you<00:03:12.950> click<00:03:13.130> on<00:03:13.190> that<00:03:13.550> it'll<00:03:13.880> ask<00:03:14.150> you<00:03:14.450> to

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
so if you click on that it'll ask you to

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.500 
so if you click on that it'll ask you to
create<00:03:14.840> a<00:03:14.959> password<00:03:15.260> now<00:03:16.190> when<00:03:16.880> you<00:03:16.970> type<00:03:17.209> in

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
create a password now when you type in

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.539 
create a password now when you type in
your<00:03:17.810> password

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
your password

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.380 
your password
normally<00:03:19.549> that<00:03:19.580> would<00:03:19.730> just<00:03:20.000> be<00:03:20.090> what<00:03:20.269> you

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
normally that would just be what you

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.300 
normally that would just be what you
would<00:03:20.480> use<00:03:20.720> to<00:03:20.989> get<00:03:21.170> on<00:03:21.350> to<00:03:21.500> any<00:03:21.680> network<00:03:21.920> that

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
would use to get on to any network that

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.810 
would use to get on to any network that
you've<00:03:22.400> created

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
you've created

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.850 
you've created
but<00:03:23.120> with<00:03:23.239> WEP<00:03:23.510> what<00:03:24.200> it<00:03:24.290> does<00:03:24.440> is<00:03:24.590> it<00:03:24.680> creates

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
but with WEP what it does is it creates

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.850 
but with WEP what it does is it creates
a<00:03:25.400> hex<00:03:25.790> key<00:03:26.330> okay<00:03:26.810> so<00:03:26.870> you<00:03:27.080> put<00:03:27.140> in<00:03:27.440> your

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
a hex key okay so you put in your

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.979 
a hex key okay so you put in your
password<00:03:28.100> maybe<00:03:28.610> it's<00:03:28.790> a<00:03:28.820> mom<00:03:29.060> and<00:03:29.360> then<00:03:29.810> it'll

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
password maybe it's a mom and then it'll

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.140 
password maybe it's a mom and then it'll
kick<00:03:30.410> out<00:03:30.590> a<00:03:30.650> whole<00:03:31.010> bunch<00:03:31.040> of<00:03:31.370> letters<00:03:31.820> and

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
kick out a whole bunch of letters and

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.780 
setting up the MAC address onto the base
so<00:04:41.510> it<00:04:41.630> knows<00:04:41.810> exactly<00:04:42.290> which<00:04:42.590> repeater<00:04:43.520> it's

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
so it knows exactly which repeater it's

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.840 
so it knows exactly which repeater it's
talking<00:04:44.060> to<00:04:44.800> alright<00:04:45.800> so<00:04:46.010> we<00:04:46.130> just<00:04:46.160> set<00:04:46.520> up<00:04:46.640> our
