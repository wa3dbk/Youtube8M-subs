 for girls welcome to the channel and in the 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.350
 video otherwise are a series of tips 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.660
 that the girls will come to us 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.820
 good for our situations our 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.650
 mishaps and to get out of those 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.619
 situations in which we do not know what 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.420
 do and are very easy tips that I 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.430
 I always use and I want you to 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.390
 you know so if you want to see what they are 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.390
 stay to watch the video 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:37.410
 and this guy is for when this 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.410
 Break our favorite colors 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.160
 and as you can see, this blusher is divided 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.950
 in three tones then I will put a 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.480
 tone in one bowl and the other tone in another 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.480
 bowl so they do not mix 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.210
 ah 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.860
 and we will add alcohol to it 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.380
 form a uniform dough and be able to put 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.800
 the blusher in the container where 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.800
 they came 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.220
 ah 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.310
 once we have made the mixture 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.950
 we will move to put it in the 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.860
 container and then we will give it the form 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.380
 that the recipient has for example 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.840
 the child has a heart shape 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.680
 to go giving it the shape of the heart and a 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.680
 Oval shaped 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.350
 and once we have done it the only thing 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.570
 that you have to leave it is to dry for a 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.560
 couple of days and we can go back to using it 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.560
 as normally 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.520
 and this trick is for when we 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.160
 we stain the mask eyelid 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.860
 eyelashes and we usually tend to give 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.989
 running with your finger and this is not worse 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.270
 and what we have to do is leave 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.180
 dry the mascara and when 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.489
 it is dry to give it with a brush as a 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.160
 blur and we'll see that the mask is 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:45.019
 will be removing little by little and if you pass 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.019
 with the blusher I have the solution 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.680
 and this tips is for when we do not want 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.390
 that we are read in the chains of 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.270
 necklaces and the only thing that we have to 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.910
 to do is take a straw and put the 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.650
 end of the collar at the end of the 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.330
 straw when we have passed it what 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.140
 only thing we have to do is to buckle 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.140
 and ready 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.210
 and this last tips is for when we 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.590
 we paint the lips and we do not know that in 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.360
 the street is going to be windy and we are going to 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.690
 finish with all the hairs full of 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.690
 lip 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.239
 and I have a trick that is to apply 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:44.980
 powders over the lips so the hairs 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.780
 they will not stick and your face will not 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.030
 it will be full of lipstick 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.380
 and if you have other solutions for 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.120
 same situations that I have put 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.770
 leaving it down here because I 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.690
 I would like to know what your 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.940
 solutions I hope you liked it 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.800
 above all, it helps and we talk in 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.800
