00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.080
 this media check takes the camera 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.450
 Quality of the Samsung Galaxy Ace zoom 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.900
 to be compared to the 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.720
 receptions where the casemate 5 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.320
 and the question to clarify if the bigger one 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.619
 casing 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.110
 through the gain in quality 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:28.329
 is balanced here we see now 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:31.099
 left a photo of the case with 20.16 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:35.210
 megapixel and quite the appropriate 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:37.969
 recording the s5 with 15 8 7 megapixels 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.789
 both with 37 percent each 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.890
 the different size of the motive 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:46.339
 is the result of different ones 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:49.100
 resolution and focal length 24 millimeters 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:54.079
 when consuming in the wide angle position when 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:56.269
 s5 it is 28 mm around each 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.149
 Although four times enlarged 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:01.069
 powerful contrasts of s5 on the right 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.409
 reason of the darker exposure clearly 

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:05.449
 sharper and picture noise take 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.280
 but really not much 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.620
 be counted compliment for the s5 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.830
 may that he is a good 4 megapixel less 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.050
 it has a clear advantage that is to offer 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.960
 kay zoom of course if the zoom lens 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.570
 to use comes here now 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.150
 maximum optical factor so with 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.600
 10x zoom that corresponds to one 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.790
 Small image focal length of 240 millimeters 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.440
 Of course, there can be a smartphone without it 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:35.720
 optical zoom just not communicate 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.390
 but again back to the photo without zoom 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.570
 here falls in the corners on that 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.840
 the sharpness there significantly decreases 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.640
 from about 120 millimeters focal length is 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.540
 this phenomenon does not work anymore 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.270
 observe 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.810
 here at minimum focal length it does 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.190
 but all the more noticeable 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.710
 this is by no means about 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.360
 an individual case in this picture here 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:05.750
 Let's take a look at all corners 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:10.310
 first and then flix then top left right 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.319
 and customer right to the proof 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.329
 finally in the middle of the picture 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.870
 here are the leaves namely quite 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:17.849
 sharp 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.950
 in the usual for smartphones 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.319
 Wide angle position produces the case 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.040
 so with photos only in the middle 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.470
 are sharp 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.230
 towards the corners, the sharpness leaves much 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.470
 to be desired this problem was 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.840
 at the predecessor the galaxy s 4 zoom still 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.019
 not available like this archive 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.750
 proves once again a corner here 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.060
 100 percent there, the details are almost 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.549
 as well preserved as in the middle of the picture 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.379
 Here you can get from one for smartphones 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.989
 speak usual quality 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.519
 in photos under bad 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.690
 lighting conditions like here in the sham 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:56.609
 a candle catches the galaxy s 5 on the right 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.340
 surprisingly a bit more light 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:01.379
 the miniature eiffel tower below in the 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.750
 the middle is not anymore when it comes to consumption 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.970
 make out 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.890
 In return, the case is with his 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.390
 optical image stabilizer of course 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.370
 clear in the advantage 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.879
 these shot out of hand 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.670
 Recordings are clearly left sharp 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:19.500
 on the right shake you switch the lightning 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.099
 so one should think that the 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.299
 Xenon flash of the case boom of the LED of the S5 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.040
 should be superior 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.889
 but as you can see he is the opposite 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.560
 the case itself the steel door behind 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:34.650
 left gets more light on the s5 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.489
 as the case also runs out of the case 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.560
 area is not bigger with the cheese 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:43.980
 synonymous with the videos in full hd does that 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.209
 s5 the clearly sharp shots and 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.699
 not just in the corners 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.889
 Although with motives go with many 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:52.079
 details in the case of a panning even when 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:54.180
 s5 lost a few details 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:56.099
 but because the reason is clear 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.349
 it is better than consumption 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:00.239
 hardly worth it 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:02.069
 for the second video was the frame 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.410
 with the two smartphones on it 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.299
 held by hand 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.310
 here arise due to consumption 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.510
 of the optical stabilizer the 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.419
 calmer pictures 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.129
 there the digital stabilizing of the s5 can 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:16.620
 right not keep up 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:18.840
 but of course it succeeds in running 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.910
 not even the optical stabilizer 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.710
 to compensate for all movements 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.400
 Overall, however , the recording remains 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.320
 quiet 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.949
 Finally , a little something 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.570
 quieter motive the case left can the 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:33.310
 small hand movement almost 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.340
 fully compensate 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:39.940
 while the s5 on the right shakes so well 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:42.340
 how unrestrained in the picture reflects to 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:46.030
 finish a video of the case below 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:48.490
 use of the son is operated the 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.419
 zoom in on the volume region this 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.759
 of course you can see movement 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:54.039
 afterwards in the recording even if 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:56.229
 how a tripod is used here 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:58.780
 during the siemens can the software 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:01.300
 Avoid compression artifacts 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:04.690
 just the data rate of 17 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.419
 megabits per second but not these 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:10.660
 movement is relatively supple and that 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:12.190
 result pleasing sharp and also here 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.320
 you can see again that the blurred 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.000
 Do not corner at higher focal lengths 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.479
 occur only in the wide angle 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.039
 setting for zoom rides can indeed 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:22.389
 also buttons on the touchscreen 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:24.280
 be used 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:26.349
 here was the user interface 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.870
 the camera later on the picture 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:30.820
 However, these switches appear 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.930
 only after the volume rocker already 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.729
 was tapped 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.160
 and even this movement is enough 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:38.470
 to make a picture wobbly 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.599
 it would be better if these elements 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.270
 permanently visible would be at least 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:47.320
 if the user wishes this but one 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:49.630
 Unfortunately, this option is missing 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.060
 impressive to the samsung galaxy ace to 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.930
 in media check it leaves extremely 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.479
 ambivalent 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:58.169
 photos and photos on one side 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:06:00.669
 videos with the optical 10x zoom 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:02.010
 excellent there can be no other 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:05.020
 keep up with the smartphone 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:06.909
 as a substitute for a video camera emerges 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.099
 it still does not look for it summ 

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:11.770
 did not ride smooth enough and before 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:14.380
 all things for the operation of the zooms 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:17.050
 about the loudness rocker necessarily 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.970
 to wobble in the picture above all things 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.729
 but the picture quality is disappointing 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:24.610
 Wide angle mode than in smart phones 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:26.979
 usual picture area takes the sharpness 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:29.909
 this is the corner from immense from here 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:32.620
 the s5 turns out to be a lot better 

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:35.680
 also the xenon lightning proved in the test 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.590
 not as the LED of the s5 superior to the 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.860
 Illumination was again 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:43.080
 even more far-reaching or wider at 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:45.420
 very poor lighting conditions 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:48.330
 the case around a little less light 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:50.220
 but as the s5 it produces thanks 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:53.460
 of the optical image stabilizer 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:56.100
 sharper photos and videos 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:58.620
 clear hand breaks the cheese visually 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:00.450
 better but what does that bring if the 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.810
 Shots towards the corners and sharp 

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:03.120
 are 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:05.880
 Therefore, under the line not to 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.140
 galaxy ace be odd if you have one 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.790
 not exactly the camera commemorates 

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:11.630
 basically only in the area between 

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.750
 about 120 and 240 millimeters focal length 

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.820
 to use 

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:18.120
 what a smartphone but most 

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:20.580
 would be atypical for the mobile phone 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:24.300
 usual snapshot inserts is suitable 

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:26.730
 the s5 clearly better who is a 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.500
 snapshot smartphone with optical 

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:30.870
 image stabilizer is looking around too in 

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:33.120
 dark situations sharp photos too 

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:36.180
 should produce my view on that 

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:38.700
 lg 3 throw that you media check 

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:43.040
 has done well and also 

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:43.040
 otherwise could convince in the test
