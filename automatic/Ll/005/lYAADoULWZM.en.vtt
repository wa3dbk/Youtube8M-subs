there's<00:01:51.770> been<00:01:51.920> a<00:01:51.950> lot<00:01:52.130> of<00:01:52.160> good<00:01:52.399> reviews<00:01:52.520> of

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
there's been a lot of good reviews of

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.080 
there's been a lot of good reviews of
people<00:01:53.270> who<00:01:53.690> also<00:01:53.960> have<00:01:54.229> that<00:01:54.380> camera<00:01:54.880> who<00:01:55.880> use

this<00:01:56.270> bag<00:01:57.070> suitable<00:01:58.070> for<00:01:58.340> a<00:01:58.510> lens<00:01:59.510> from<00:01:59.990> 14<00:02:01.150> to

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
this bag suitable for a lens from 14 to

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.240 
this bag suitable for a lens from 14 to
55<00:02:03.890> millimeters<00:02:05.740> and<00:02:06.740> I<00:02:06.860> think<00:02:07.070> you<00:02:07.130> can

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
55 millimeters and I think you can

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.590 
55 millimeters and I think you can
probably<00:02:07.430> fit<00:02:07.700> a<00:02:07.729> bit<00:02:07.909> more<00:02:08.060> than<00:02:08.209> that<00:02:08.390> but

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
probably fit a bit more than that but

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.039 
probably fit a bit more than that but
that's<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:08.840> recommended<00:02:10.390> size<00:02:11.390> you<00:02:11.690> can<00:02:11.870> put

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:12.049 
that's the recommended size you can put

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:31.920 
that's the recommended size you can put
in<00:02:12.580> so<00:02:14.560> look<00:02:15.560> front<00:02:16.280> bit<00:02:16.549> from<00:02:17.299> compartment

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.770 

so<00:02:32.930> front<00:02:33.200> compartment<00:02:34.600> it's<00:02:35.600> like<00:02:35.750> a

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
so front compartment it's like a

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.080 
so front compartment it's like a
reasonable-sized<00:02:37.600> just<00:02:38.600> get<00:02:38.750> rid<00:02:38.900> of<00:02:40.090> store

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
reasonable-sized just get rid of store

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:48.820 
reasonable-sized just get rid of store
