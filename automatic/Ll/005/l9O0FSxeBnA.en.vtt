00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
as thick as I want it to be it works and

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.170 
as thick as I want it to be it works and
my<00:01:18.090> hair<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.690> like<00:01:19.110> stupid<00:01:19.770> soft<00:01:20.250> it's<00:01:21.030> like

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
my hair is like stupid soft it's like

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.910 
my hair is like stupid soft it's like
it's<00:01:21.690> still<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.959> same<00:01:22.080> ingredients<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:22.800> it's

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
not going to be the reason why it

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.169
