00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.170
 storm shoes the hardness test if you 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.060
 A dinghy wants to see something 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.890
 For example, you also need something 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.970
 broken is a dinghy for example 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.970
 and here we go 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.640
 so meanwhile hand laid on this 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.909
 dinghy we wanted to have something 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:13.080
 What we especially like the special glue 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.920
 sneakers accuse themselves of eating 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.659
 so you all that neat 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.979
 stick together and so we have ourselves 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.869
 to splash out a dinghy times 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:24.520
 to relinquish the view like this hole 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.960
 can be very big but still one 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.390
 challenge for one of the 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.570
 script with the appropriate instructions 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.390
 and technology but maybe one 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.250
 too difficult and manageable 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.250
 task for everyone and that's exactly why 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.780
 it goes with our experiment storm 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.300
 school to show that with the right one 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.850
 guide the correct glue and the 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.220
 correct corresponding repair kit as 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.520
 also material around the storm piece 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.560
 glue it on liver or even without it 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.130
 to make such a boat functional again 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.920
 can do and thus again to another 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:03.600
 drives daily silly and fun 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.600
 we are curious 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:57.000
 so the experiment storm shoes if we 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.980
 with the dukes we are in great 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.490
 number mend meanwhile the 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.260
 cut from 250 bar air pressure 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:08.100
 but then speak at high pressure air 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.220
 floors in these inflatable boats was 06 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.770
 So 600 mini bar pressure 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:17.100
 another challenge for storm 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:21.540
 chase the super glue we're doing now 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.520
 see a cut in here with it too 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.320
 the inner of such a floor very much 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.490
 interesting looks very many fibers 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:32.730
 a honeycomb, of course, why 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.500
 this ground is not fundamentally easy 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.940
 Only a bump will make him so hard 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.070
 but it has to be solved somehow 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.200
 that really is one 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:45.780
 board is similar are also curious here 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:52.110
 if that is maintained at the end what 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:53.910
 According to the gate to the world and whether it 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.110
 Keep what we promise or what we do 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.560
 we promise that is the 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.150
 main thing 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.490
 storm show the experiment something storm 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.430
 shoes the challenge and the experiment 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.410
 at that time, sneakers are considered like 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.750
 you could best make a special one 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.310
 glue and its properties 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.370
 imagine and are in it 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.140
 come that we have inflatables older 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.880
 vintage just disassemble 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.440
 in that case we have two 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.100
 inflatables today with the 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.430
 carpet knife in two parts and become 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.080
 the customers who applied 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.360
 including 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.770
 a small range of grebe help 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.620
 from the house storm shoes 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.030
 the special feature of storm school is 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.889
 that it's not like most 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:43.229
 conventional glue in contact with 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.810
 Air hardens but in the case with 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.400
 contact with water better said 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.810
 maybe even moisture when you are 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.580
 these liquid easily three capable masses 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.280
 in the storm he needs glue 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:59.039
 twelve hours to endure if one 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.780
 it is mixed with water 1 percent 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:02.849
 only one and a half hours you can do it 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.830
 even up to 40 percent with water 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:08.190
 mix around it three times with the 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.650
 apply brush just then if we 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.729
 have big porous boats or if we have 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.379
 have these tents 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:15.440
 There are a lot of different things 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:17.940
 application areas with this glue and 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.590
 what better better for it 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.650
 Anglers add as an adhesive to the 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.840
 Water contact hardens naturally 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.550
 it was very close to everything but all that was left 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.860
 not enough reason for us the product in the 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.500
 program to take in the program too 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.940
 just take the test because of that 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.360
 experiment we have a total of ten 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.099
 inflatables with mouse with miscellaneous 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.169
 others are also punching through that 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:41.610
 normal handling or abnormal 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:44.129
 Handling can happen here and there 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.990
 and besides two extreme challenges 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:48.150
 We just prepared it 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.740
 have a dinghy with you 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.629
 actually grown to heart 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.150
 Again, that too had to suffer 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:56.330
 today and we want to see what happens 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.319
 More in a moment 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.029
 By the way, before the inside of 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:01.889
 inflatable boats just where you get from 

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:05.089
 the so-called membrane always speaks 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:07.259
 tree so do not be afraid there is quite 

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:09.419
 Stable thick material is there 

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:12.449
 used and that's always that 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:14.069
 same as used outside 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:15.839
 However, in the fall of the year 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:17.759
 color here uninteresting why here 

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:19.080
 kept white if that then twice too 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:21.690
 Wear comes as here will be 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:24.240
 thick accordingly that is very 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:26.580
 he just assumes that at 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.620
 Any manufacturer on marin or ipods 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.060
 or whatever company does the same 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.430
 is handled so but also one 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.029
 big pad again in both 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.729
 directions 

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:37.860
 today one understands even if a hole in 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:39.860
 there is a chamber and the air is out 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.759
 then it goes to the next chamber 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.130
 suffering badly 

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:46.229
 small tip at this point if you 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:48.120
 so you know that you have a hole in it 

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:51.209
 dinghy and nothing to mend 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:53.399
 then it is best that 

00:06:51.209 --> 00:06:55.529
 the chambers where the hole is in it 

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:58.050
 is the last to inflate in the 

00:06:55.529 --> 00:07:00.360
 in fact, the loss of air would 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.770
 in this chamber do not make sure that 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.050
 the next chamber loses air because 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:06.569
 this is then fully inflated and 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:09.060
 the membrane in this direction is therefore 

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:12.240
 quite simply the camera will notice that 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:15.229
 hole last bloated like that 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.229
 friends party
