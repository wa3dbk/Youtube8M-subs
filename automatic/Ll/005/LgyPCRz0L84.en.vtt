00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.840
The feeling of being at the front
and on top is completely intoxicating.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.360
In every sport I participated in,
I always wanted to be out front and win.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.200
I always did everything I could to win.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.080
At age five, I already knew
all the models and was obsessed.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.200
It was exactly around this time
that my dad had an M3.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.200
His M3 was black.
It was a great car. I really liked it.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.040
I tried out my first go-kart at ten.
That's when it all started.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.200
My parents supported me early on and did
everything they could for me to succeed.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.960
I'm very thankful for that.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.920
Without my parents,
I wouldn't be here today.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.160
The BMW M4 Coupé fascinates me.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.640
I received one last week,
and it's simply a wonderful car.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.640
I was also involved in its development
on the Nürburgring in August 2013.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.440
That was very interesting for me.
This car is a racer's dream.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.160
The M4 model is very compact and sporty.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.320
The car
can simply do everything on the street.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.520
You could compare motor sports
to riding in an lift.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.920
You always start at the bottom.
Every year.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.240
You work hard at every race
to pull ahead.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.680
To improve the car,
and yourself as well.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.800
Step by step, you reach the next level.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.200
Then you get closer and closer
to taking the lead.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.440
If the season was a good one,
you might come out on top.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.640
If not,
you have to try it again next year.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.840
I always remain very motivated,
no matter what happens.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.080
It's easy for me to forget
both the good times and the bad.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.800
That's why I can always focus
on what's happening now,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.120
on the current moment.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.040
And simply try my utmost to fight

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.640
and clinch the title
as quickly as I can.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.720
In 2012, together with BMW,
everything worked out sensationally.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.800
When I crossed the finish line
of the last race in Hockenheim,

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.760
in the finals with a full house
and great atmosphere...

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.320
Winning the race
and the championship with my team...

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.960
It was a real high.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.280
&lt;i&gt;Guys, I don't believe it!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;We are champions!&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.800
Today, whenever I win a DTM race,
I have the same feeling.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.400
It's always a special feeling.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.360
I don't believe it!

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.040
You always want that feeling again.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.840
That's why you work hard every day
with your team,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.040
to keep on experiencing
that adrenaline kick on the podium.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.280
That's why I do motor sports.
That's why motor sports are so great.
