00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
but hello again and then this is

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.510 
but hello again and then this is
probably<00:02:01.710> gonna<00:02:01.829> be<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.009> most<00:02:02.340> useful

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
probably gonna be the most useful

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.990 
probably gonna be the most useful
because<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.240> thing<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.689> use<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.140> most<00:02:05.000> so

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
because the thing that I use the most so

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.210 
because the thing that I use the most so
it'll<00:02:06.180> probably<00:02:06.210> aggregate<00:02:06.990> way<00:02:07.590> more<00:02:07.829> words

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
it'll probably aggregate way more words

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.070 
it'll probably aggregate way more words
then<00:02:08.819> Gmail<00:02:09.810> did<00:02:11.090> so<00:02:12.090> it's<00:02:12.239> gonna<00:02:12.360> load<00:02:12.629> its

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
then Gmail did so it's gonna load its

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.899 
then Gmail did so it's gonna load its
going

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:13.909 
going

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:16.849 
going
ask<00:02:14.909> if<00:02:15.629> you<00:02:15.689> want<00:02:16.019> to<00:02:16.109> authorize<00:02:16.290> it<00:02:16.709> we're

ask if you want to authorize it we're

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:19.009 
ask if you want to authorize it we're
gonna<00:02:16.950> obviously<00:02:17.219> click<00:02:17.579> okay<00:02:17.909> and<00:02:18.209> then<00:02:18.780> it's

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
gonna obviously click okay and then it's

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.750 
gonna obviously click okay and then it's
going<00:02:19.109> to<00:02:19.170> import<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.799> again<00:02:20.159> this<00:02:20.340> is<00:02:20.489> capped

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
going to import and again this is capped

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.459 
going to import and again this is capped
at<00:02:21.019> 100<00:02:22.579> so<00:02:23.579> there<00:02:23.730> you<00:02:23.849> go<00:02:23.999> there's<00:02:24.959> my<00:02:25.230> name

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:25.469 
at 100 so there you go there's my name

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:27.649 
at 100 so there you go there's my name
which<00:02:26.040> I<00:02:26.249> would<00:02:26.430> love<00:02:26.609> it<00:02:26.819> to<00:02:27.120> learn<00:02:27.389> and<00:02:27.569> then

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
which I would love it to learn and then

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.179 
which I would love it to learn and then
my<00:02:27.870> friend's<00:02:28.230> last<00:02:28.409> name<00:02:28.680> which<00:02:28.859> would<00:02:28.950> always

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:29.189 
my friend's last name which would always

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.520 
my friend's last name which would always
autocorrects<00:02:29.700> so<00:02:30.420> import<00:02:30.840> those<00:02:30.989> two<00:02:31.290> words

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
autocorrects so import those two words

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.729 
autocorrects so import those two words
and<00:02:32.389> then<00:02:33.389> those<00:02:33.540> are<00:02:33.569> added<00:02:34.049> so<00:02:34.200> obviously

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
and then those are added so obviously

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.729 
and then those are added so obviously
the<00:02:34.889> more<00:02:34.920> words<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.609> use<00:02:36.319> the<00:02:37.319> more<00:02:37.530> will<00:02:37.650> be

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
the more words you use the more will be

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.069 
the more words you use the more will be
imported<00:02:38.250> so<00:02:38.939> I<00:02:38.969> only<00:02:39.209> had<00:02:39.419> two<00:02:39.629> of<00:02:39.810> for<00:02:39.989> each

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
imported so I only had two of for each

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.110 
imported so I only had two of for each
of<00:02:40.290> them<00:02:40.409> but<00:02:40.590> if<00:02:40.739> I<00:02:40.889> used<00:02:41.430> made<00:02:41.760> up<00:02:41.879> a<00:02:41.969> hundred

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
of them but if I used made up a hundred

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.699 
of them but if I used made up a hundred
different<00:02:42.599> words<00:02:42.900> it<00:02:43.109> would<00:02:43.200> actually<00:02:43.409> add

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
different words it would actually add

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.970 
different words it would actually add
all<00:02:43.980> those<00:02:44.189> hundred<00:02:44.549> words<00:02:45.290> so<00:02:46.290> this<00:02:46.680> that's

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
all those hundred words so this that's

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.179 
all those hundred words so this that's
really<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.400> app<00:02:47.599> you<00:02:48.599> can<00:02:48.750> backup<00:02:49.189> by

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:50.189 
really the app you can backup by

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:51.860 
really the app you can backup by
clicking<00:02:50.519> here<00:02:50.669> it'll<00:02:50.879> set<00:02:51.090> up<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.269> backup<00:02:51.480> and

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
clicking here it'll set up a backup and

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.659 
clicking here it'll set up a backup and
then<00:02:51.959> overwrite<00:02:52.500> previous<00:02:53.069> backup<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.579> all

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:53.669 
then overwrite previous backup and all

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:55.640 
then overwrite previous backup and all
you<00:02:53.760> have<00:02:53.879> to<00:02:53.909> do<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.209> load<00:02:54.419> that<00:02:54.599> is<00:02:54.810> if<00:02:55.049> you

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
you have to do to load that is if you

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.289 
you have to do to load that is if you
lose<00:02:55.889> your<00:02:56.069> phone<00:02:56.219> or<00:02:56.519> you<00:02:56.639> clear<00:02:56.909> your<00:02:57.060> data
