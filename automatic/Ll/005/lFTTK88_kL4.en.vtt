00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.300
 the public that attended the Saturday to the Marbella master took a pleasant 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:06.620
 surprise 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.850
 the mijeña pillar domínguez planted face martina jinkis against all prognosis 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.449
 In the moments before the match, he was eager to demonstrate his 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:17.839
 I was worth 

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:20.199
 it was a lot of illusion 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.809
 by 100 also nerves but I come to enjoy and what happened 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.029
 in the early stages of the pillar confrontation was not 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.290
 comfortable before the great game that the Swiss was deploying 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.260
 the game was played to a set of nobel crows 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.830
 king and is that he was more than two hundred weeks at number one of the tt is 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.160
 put with a 4 to 0 in favor but the pride and the great quality of dominguez 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.660
 appeared when the worst was happening was a member of the luminous a 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.680
 tight 4 3 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.680
 blows like this made the comeback possible 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.940
 but who had retained and martina knew how to counteract the game of the Spanish 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.760
 putting the score a resounding 9 to 3 that gave him the final victory 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.250
 It was the image that left the pillar domínguez the marbella master so we 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.250
 he was talking about the season he's doing 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.850
 it was so 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.880
 in this report I'm not going to eta is rising in the ranking 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.880
 and this one 500 something innocent innocent 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.730
 pillar is a tennis player who trains bottom thanks to it has gotten 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.829
 great achievements this season 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.829
 like the championship of Spain in cadet category 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.840
 the good I started from very small 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:38.770
 I mentalized that I was a professional 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:39.940
 up to big 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.840
 and already counted years ago and I started already in earnest and you'll see 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.189
 profession 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:50.329
 He has always been a finalist and he added that he won 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.950
 it's hard for me to beat him but the nfl is undone he trains himself a lot of honor and 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.530
 but I do not have time for the unit and I'm jealous some weekend but 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.580
 good the sacrificed 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.920
 a champion that in a few years maybe the mullah will play like one 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.210
 indies martinage 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.840
 the fans could also see in action until another great tennis player took 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.600
 Ubeda who showed that he does not spend the years for example to continue 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.489
 the moya to ferrero and nadal 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.909
