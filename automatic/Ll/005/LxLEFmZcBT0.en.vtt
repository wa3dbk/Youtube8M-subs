him<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.739> don't<00:00:43.890> know<00:00:44.040> what<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.640> was<00:00:44.910> doing<00:00:45.390> at

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
him I don't know what I was doing at

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.110 
him I don't know what I was doing at
that<00:00:45.690> time<00:00:45.899> for<00:00:46.800> some<00:00:47.010> reason<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.460> ran<00:00:47.760> right

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
that time for some reason I ran right

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.690 
that time for some reason I ran right
past<00:00:48.440> but<00:00:49.440> uh<00:00:49.469> then<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.160> start<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.430> question

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
past but uh then you start to question

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.639 
past but uh then you start to question
the<00:00:51.059> logic<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.690> awareness<00:00:52.170> at<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.410> game

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
the logic and awareness at this game

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.580 
the logic and awareness at this game
they<00:00:53.100> did<00:00:53.460> not<00:00:53.640> even<00:00:53.699> care<00:00:54.449> all<00:00:54.780> three<00:00:55.289> bears

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
they did not even care all three bears

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.889 
they did not even care all three bears
players<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.550> was<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.239> were<00:00:57.390> blocking<00:00:57.629> for

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
players that was that were blocking for

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.330 
players that was that were blocking for
the<00:00:57.989> screen<00:00:58.260> did<00:00:58.500> not<00:00:58.649> even<00:00:58.800> care<00:00:59.280> that

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
the screen did not even care that

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.630 
the screen did not even care that
Godfrey<00:01:00.090> was<00:01:00.300> there<00:01:00.570> instead<00:01:01.559> they<00:01:01.890> ran<00:01:02.190> past

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
Godfrey was there instead they ran past

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.479 
Godfrey was there instead they ran past
as<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.390> can<00:01:03.539> c<00:01:03.809> 63<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.739> don't<00:01:05.010> know<00:01:05.129> what<00:01:05.280> he's

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
as you can c 63 I don't know what he's

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.490 
as you can c 63 I don't know what he's
doing<00:01:05.540> 75<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.780> still<00:01:07.020> running<00:01:07.320> upfield<00:01:09.020> 68<00:01:10.020> I

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
doing 75 is still running upfield 68 I

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.609 
doing 75 is still running upfield 68 I
don't<00:01:10.770> even<00:01:10.830> think<00:01:11.010> 68<00:01:11.790> even<00:01:12.590> bothered<00:01:13.590> to

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
don't even think 68 even bothered to

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.249 
don't even think 68 even bothered to
block<00:01:13.979> anyone<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:15.360> just<00:01:15.689> looks<00:01:15.990> like<00:01:16.080> a

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
block anyone it just looks like a

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.219 
block anyone it just looks like a
complete<00:01:16.979> mess<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.970> plague<00:01:18.270> looked<00:01:18.840> like<00:01:19.020> it

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
complete mess the plague looked like it

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.830 
complete mess the plague looked like it
was<00:01:19.380> set<00:01:19.890> up<00:01:20.009> for<00:01:20.189> success<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.850> can<00:01:21.000> see<00:01:21.210> 17

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
was set up for success you can see 17

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.310 
was set up for success you can see 17
and<00:01:21.990> 60<00:01:22.350> are<00:01:22.619> still<00:01:23.100> running<00:01:23.970> up<00:01:24.420> field<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.290> a

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
and 60 are still running up field so a

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.469 
and 60 are still running up field so a
75<00:01:27.799> nobody's<00:01:28.799> turning<00:01:29.159> around<00:01:29.430> until<00:01:30.180> like

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
75 nobody's turning around until like

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.460 
75 nobody's turning around until like
the<00:01:30.720> last<00:01:30.770> moment<00:01:31.770> even<00:01:32.579> as<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.420> can<00:01:33.600> see<00:01:33.810> Matt

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
the last moment even as you can see Matt

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.030 
the last moment even as you can see Matt
Forte<00:01:35.040> man<00:01:35.369> he<00:01:35.820> he<00:01:36.390> even<00:01:36.840> takes<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.500> bad<00:01:37.740> angle

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
Forte man he he even takes the bad angle

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.210 
Forte man he he even takes the bad angle
but<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.700> mean<00:01:38.880> let<00:01:39.090> me<00:01:39.210> look<00:01:39.420> at<00:01:39.570> 68<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.320> 17<00:01:40.920> man

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
but I mean let me look at 68 and 17 man

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.130 
but I mean let me look at 68 and 17 man
like<00:01:41.490> they're<00:01:41.700> not<00:01:41.909> they're<00:01:42.540> not<00:01:42.570> doing

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
like they're not they're not doing

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.780 
like they're not they're not doing
anything<00:01:43.710> like<00:01:44.159> they're<00:01:44.399> just<00:01:44.610> come

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
anything like they're just come

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.690 
anything like they're just come
completely<00:01:45.659> running<00:01:46.110> out<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.740> play<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.670> I

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
completely running out of the play so I

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.810 
completely running out of the play so I
mean<00:01:48.329> like<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.659> said<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.869> don't<00:01:48.990> understand<00:01:49.820> the

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
mean like I said I don't understand the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.810 
mean like I said I don't understand the
logic<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.600> programming<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.950> know<00:01:53.070> they've

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
logic the programming you know they've

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.780 
logic the programming you know they've
been<00:01:54.000> talking<00:01:54.180> about<00:01:54.890> certain<00:01:55.890> calculations

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
been talking about certain calculations

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.910 
been talking about certain calculations
per<00:01:57.479> second<00:01:57.990> when<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.229> comes<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.680> this

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
per second when it comes to this

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.730 
per second when it comes to this
programming<00:01:59.610> look<00:02:00.090> at<00:02:00.240> Matt<00:02:00.420> Forte<00:02:00.869> he<00:02:01.079> makes

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
programming look at Matt Forte he makes

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.249 
programming look at Matt Forte he makes
a<00:02:01.979> terrible<00:02:02.430> decision<00:02:03.030> instead<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:04.020> running

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
a terrible decision instead of running

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.210 
a terrible decision instead of running
up<00:02:04.380> field<00:02:04.649> he<00:02:04.860> runs<00:02:05.100> completely<00:02:05.700> towards<00:02:06.509> my

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
up field he runs completely towards my

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.979 
up field he runs completely towards my
Panther<00:02:08.220> players<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.819> yes<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.479> game<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:09.720> on

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
Panther players and yes the game is on
