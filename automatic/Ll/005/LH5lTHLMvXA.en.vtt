00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
and sometimes I use a food processor but

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.790 
and sometimes I use a food processor but
since<00:00:42.120> most<00:00:42.239> people<00:00:42.330> don't<00:00:42.570> have<00:00:42.660> one<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.290> my

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
since most people don't have one and my

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.860 
since most people don't have one and my
food<00:00:44.040> processor<00:00:44.190> looks<00:00:44.790> all<00:00:44.970> grimy<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.780> it

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
food processor looks all grimy and it

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.810 
food processor looks all grimy and it
does<00:00:46.050> not<00:00:46.200> look<00:00:46.350> sexy<00:00:46.620> on<00:00:46.860> camera<00:00:47.220> I<00:00:47.430> decided

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
does not look sexy on camera I decided

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.770 
does not look sexy on camera I decided
to<00:00:48.000> use<00:00:48.090> my<00:00:48.239> blender

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
to use my blender

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.729 
to use my blender
um<00:00:49.580> probably<00:00:50.580> for<00:00:50.760> one<00:00:50.910> can<00:00:51.150> of<00:00:51.300> chickpeas<00:00:51.739> put

like natural peanut butter and it

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.760 
like natural peanut butter and it
separates<00:01:49.819> um<00:01:51.380> so<00:01:52.380> yeah<00:01:52.890> English<00:01:53.610> and

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
separates um so yeah English and

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.160 
separates um so yeah English and
probably<00:01:55.770> two<00:01:56.190> tablespoons<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.750> start<00:01:57.990> with

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
probably two tablespoons to start with

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.559 
probably two tablespoons to start with
it's<00:01:58.590> kind<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:58.950> bitter<00:01:59.490> if<00:01:59.940> you<00:02:00.240> put<00:02:00.420> too<00:02:00.539> much

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:00.569 
it's kind of bitter if you put too much

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:04.309 
it's kind of bitter if you put too much
in<00:02:01.970> so<00:02:02.970> but<00:02:03.360> then<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.539> lemon<00:02:03.869> juice<00:02:03.990> kind<00:02:04.229> of

in so but then the lemon juice kind of

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.809 
in so but then the lemon juice kind of
counteracts<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:05.539> bitterness<00:02:07.069> and<00:02:08.069> that's

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
counteracts that bitterness and that's

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.360 
counteracts that bitterness and that's
good<00:02:09.470> just<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.619> couple<00:02:10.800> tablespoons<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.280> olive
