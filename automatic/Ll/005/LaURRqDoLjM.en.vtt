dr. David Gabriel and here is David you
tell<00:00:23.020> me<00:00:23.140> a<00:00:23.320> little<00:00:23.500> bit<00:00:23.619> about<00:00:23.800> your<00:00:24.040> research

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279 
tell me a little bit about your research

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.940 
tell me a little bit about your research
sure<00:00:25.150> the<00:00:26.050> lab<00:00:26.260> is<00:00:26.680> concerned<00:00:27.490> with<00:00:27.760> two<00:00:28.090> areas

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:28.950 
sure the lab is concerned with two areas

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.100 
sure the lab is concerned with two areas
one<00:00:29.950> is<00:00:30.250> how<00:00:31.000> the<00:00:31.060> nervous<00:00:31.270> system<00:00:31.810> controls

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
one is how the nervous system controls

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.979 
one is how the nervous system controls
skeletal<00:00:32.860> muscle<00:00:33.190> so<00:00:33.850> that<00:00:34.059> you<00:00:34.239> can<00:00:34.570> become

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
skeletal muscle so that you can become

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:37.410 
skeletal muscle so that you can become
stronger<00:00:35.410> or<00:00:35.770> faster<00:00:36.120> whether<00:00:37.120> you're

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
stronger or faster whether you're

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.530 
stronger or faster whether you're
concerned<00:00:37.780> with<00:00:37.960> sport<00:00:38.350> or<00:00:38.640> as<00:00:39.640> a<00:00:40.090> result<00:00:40.390> of

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
concerned with sport or as a result of

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.080 
concerned with sport or as a result of
some<00:00:40.840> sort<00:00:41.110> of<00:00:41.170> rehabilitation<00:00:41.890> program<00:00:42.340> and

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
some sort of rehabilitation program and

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.689 
some sort of rehabilitation program and
the<00:00:43.239> second<00:00:43.629> area<00:00:43.870> is<00:00:44.670> innovating<00:00:45.670> new

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
the second area is innovating new

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:48.180 
the second area is innovating new
methods<00:00:46.239> for<00:00:46.480> measuring<00:00:46.720> muscle<00:00:47.710> electrical

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
methods for measuring muscle electrical

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.910 
methods for measuring muscle electrical
activity<00:00:48.700> because<00:00:49.030> that's<00:00:49.239> how<00:00:49.480> we<00:00:49.920> assess

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
activity because that's how we assess

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.520 
activity because that's how we assess
how<00:00:51.160> the<00:00:51.220> nervous<00:00:51.430> system<00:00:51.910> controls<00:00:52.530> skeletal

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
how the nervous system controls skeletal

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.139 
how the nervous system controls skeletal
muscle<00:00:53.860> and<00:00:54.190> if<00:00:54.399> you're<00:00:54.489> not<00:00:54.579> familiar<00:00:54.760> with

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
muscle and if you're not familiar with

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.889 
muscle and if you're not familiar with
that<00:00:55.620> it's<00:00:56.620> called<00:00:56.950> electromyography<00:00:57.899> and

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
that it's called electromyography and

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.670 
that it's called electromyography and
electromyography<00:00:59.530> is<00:00:59.920> very<00:01:00.160> similar<00:01:00.399> to

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
electromyography is very similar to

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.410 
electromyography is very similar to
electrocardiography<00:01:02.680> or<00:01:02.800> EKG<00:01:03.250> so<00:01:03.700> if<00:01:03.760> you<00:01:03.910> get

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
electrocardiography or EKG so if you get

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.020 
electrocardiography or EKG so if you get
so<00:01:04.899> if<00:01:05.020> you've<00:01:05.170> ever<00:01:05.320> watched<00:01:06.280> one<00:01:06.789> of<00:01:06.820> those

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
so if you've ever watched one of those

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.420 
so if you've ever watched one of those
TV<00:01:08.020> hospital<00:01:08.500> shows<00:01:08.680> where<00:01:08.920> somebody<00:01:09.280> goes

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
TV hospital shows where somebody goes

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.570 
TV hospital shows where somebody goes
into<00:01:09.729> cardiac<00:01:09.910> arrest<00:01:10.210> yeah<00:01:10.899> and<00:01:11.190> they<00:01:12.190> have

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
into cardiac arrest yeah and they have

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.660 
into cardiac arrest yeah and they have
to<00:01:12.759> put<00:01:13.060> electrodes<00:01:13.690> on<00:01:13.930> the<00:01:13.990> ribcage<00:01:14.560> just<00:01:14.950> to

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
to put electrodes on the ribcage just to

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.450 
to put electrodes on the ribcage just to
monitor<00:01:15.880> in<00:01:16.660> on<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.649> computer<00:01:18.070> screen<00:01:18.190> you

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
monitor in on the computer screen you

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.010 
monitor in on the computer screen you
see<00:01:18.490> that<00:01:18.670> little<00:01:18.789> blip<00:01:19.060> that<00:01:19.600> you<00:01:19.720> get<00:01:19.869> in<00:01:19.929> the

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
see that little blip that you get in the

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.190 
see that little blip that you get in the
background<00:01:20.500> that's<00:01:21.190> the<00:01:21.399> EKG<00:01:22.000> signal<00:01:22.450> and<00:01:22.630> so

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
background that's the EKG signal and so

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.779 
background that's the EKG signal and so
instead<00:01:23.350> of<00:01:23.560> putting<00:01:23.679> electrodes<00:01:24.369> on<00:01:24.640> the

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
instead of putting electrodes on the

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.480 
instead of putting electrodes on the
ribcage<00:01:24.970> to<00:01:25.750> measure<00:01:25.959> cardiac<00:01:26.890> muscle

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
ribcage to measure cardiac muscle

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.430 
ribcage to measure cardiac muscle
electrical<00:01:28.030> activity<00:01:28.479> we<00:01:28.840> put<00:01:29.050> those<00:01:29.170> same

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
electrical activity we put those same

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.830 
electrical activity we put those same
electrodes<00:01:30.009> on<00:01:30.250> skeletal<00:01:31.209> muscles<00:01:31.569> such<00:01:31.690> as

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
electrodes on skeletal muscles such as

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.230 
electrodes on skeletal muscles such as
the<00:01:31.929> biceps<00:01:32.470> or<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:33.099> quadriceps<00:01:33.729> up<00:01:33.940> of<00:01:34.090> the

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
the biceps or the quadriceps up of the

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.080 
the biceps or the quadriceps up of the
upper<00:01:34.539> lake<00:01:34.720> and<00:01:35.490> measure<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:36.670> electrical

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
upper lake and measure the electrical

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.790 
upper lake and measure the electrical
activity<00:01:37.179> that<00:01:37.750> comes<00:01:37.990> out<00:01:38.170> of<00:01:38.200> them<00:01:38.440> during<00:01:38.649> a

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
activity that comes out of them during a

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.010 
activity that comes out of them during a
muscle<00:01:39.099> contraction<00:01:39.610> so<00:01:40.360> I've<00:01:40.780> gone<00:01:40.959> through

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
muscle contraction so I've gone through

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.570 
muscle contraction so I've gone through
some<00:01:41.289> of<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:41.440> testing<00:01:41.770> they've<00:01:42.130> done<00:01:42.340> in<00:01:42.429> lab

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
some of the testing they've done in lab

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.249 
some of the testing they've done in lab
I<00:01:42.849> lost<00:01:43.149> a<00:01:43.209> little<00:01:43.300> bit<00:01:43.420> of<00:01:43.479> leg<00:01:43.630> here<00:01:43.869> got

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
I lost a little bit of leg here got

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:45.960 
I lost a little bit of leg here got
shocked<00:01:44.470> a<00:01:44.500> few<00:01:44.740> times<00:01:44.950> that<00:01:45.670> was<00:01:45.789> all<00:01:45.880> the

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
shocked a few times that was all the

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.790 
shocked a few times that was all the
name<00:01:46.090> of<00:01:46.179> science<00:01:46.360> yeah<00:01:46.929> so<00:01:47.349> why<00:01:47.500> don't<00:01:47.649> we<00:01:47.679> go

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
name of science yeah so why don't we go

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.949 
name of science yeah so why don't we go
find<00:01:47.979> out<00:01:48.190> what<00:01:48.280> that<00:01:48.399> means<00:01:48.610> your<00:01:49.000> love<00:01:49.179> you

00:01:49.949 --> 00:01:49.959 
find out what that means your love you

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:51.930 
find out what that means your love you
all's<00:01:50.170> are<00:01:50.349> covered<00:01:50.560> in<00:01:50.590> copper<00:01:50.950> can<00:01:51.700> you<00:01:51.759> tell

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
all's are covered in copper can you tell

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.389 
all's are covered in copper can you tell
me<00:01:52.030> why<00:01:52.780> the<00:01:53.349> inner<00:01:53.619> room<00:01:53.830> of<00:01:54.009> this<00:01:54.130> lab<00:01:54.369> is

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
me why the inner room of this lab is

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.880 
me why the inner room of this lab is
called<00:01:54.819> a<00:01:55.119> Faraday<00:01:55.599> cage<00:01:55.630> and<00:01:56.259> the<00:01:56.470> copper

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
called a Faraday cage and the copper

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.580 
called a Faraday cage and the copper
wire<00:01:57.270> keeps<00:01:58.270> out<00:01:58.590> electromagnetic

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
wire keeps out electromagnetic

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.850 
wire keeps out electromagnetic
interference<00:02:00.280> from<00:02:00.580> lights<00:02:01.390> overhead

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
interference from lights overhead

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.529 
interference from lights overhead
electrical<00:02:02.860> sockets<00:02:03.399> because<00:02:04.330> muscle

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
electrical sockets because muscle

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:07.680 
electrical sockets because muscle
electrical<00:02:05.349> activity<00:02:05.770> is<00:02:05.890> so<00:02:06.190> small<00:02:06.580> that<00:02:06.690> any

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
electrical activity is so small that any

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.479 
electrical activity is so small that any
electromagnetic<00:02:08.229> interference<00:02:09.190> will<00:02:09.310> just

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
electromagnetic interference will just

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:10.770 
electromagnetic interference will just
drawn<00:02:09.729> it<00:02:09.880> up<00:02:10.000> and<00:02:10.209> won't<00:02:10.330> be<00:02:10.390> able<00:02:10.479> to<00:02:10.660> measure

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
it icky tell me what your most current

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.820 
it icky tell me what your most current
research<00:02:12.580> is<00:02:13.000> looking<00:02:13.030> at<00:02:13.440> right<00:02:14.440> now<00:02:14.500> what

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
research is looking at right now what

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.520 
research is looking at right now what
we're<00:02:14.980> looking<00:02:15.340> at<00:02:15.459> is<00:02:15.910> how<00:02:16.569> people<00:02:16.870> recover

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
we're looking at is how people recover

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.610 
we're looking at is how people recover
from<00:02:17.650> fatigue<00:02:18.330> we've<00:02:19.330> noticed<00:02:19.720> that<00:02:19.989> when<00:02:20.410> you

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
from fatigue we've noticed that when you

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.610 
from fatigue we've noticed that when you
perform<00:02:21.270> many<00:02:22.270> contractions<00:02:22.780> in<00:02:23.140> a<00:02:23.230> row<00:02:23.409> and

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
perform many contractions in a row and

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.110 
perform many contractions in a row and
if<00:02:24.400> you<00:02:24.519> give<00:02:24.760> a<00:02:25.120> period<00:02:25.989> of<00:02:26.049> rest<00:02:26.400> some<00:02:27.400> people

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
if you give a period of rest some people

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.259 
if you give a period of rest some people
actually<00:02:28.420> come<00:02:28.629> back<00:02:28.810> stronger<00:02:29.760> then<00:02:30.760> when

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
actually come back stronger then when

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.229 
actually come back stronger then when
they<00:02:31.510> first<00:02:31.930> started<00:02:32.379> to<00:02:32.709> fatigue<00:02:33.069> so<00:02:33.819> rather

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
they first started to fatigue so rather

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:35.520 
they first started to fatigue so rather
than<00:02:34.360> going<00:02:34.629> back<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:35.080> one<00:02:35.200> hundred<00:02:35.349> percent

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
than going back to one hundred percent

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.640 
than going back to one hundred percent
of<00:02:36.159> strength<00:02:36.519> they<00:02:36.730> can<00:02:36.879> go<00:02:37.000> back<00:02:37.209> to<00:02:37.239> 105<00:02:38.230> or

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
of strength they can go back to 105 or

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.920 
of strength they can go back to 105 or
107<00:02:39.430> or<00:02:39.519> eight<00:02:39.730> and<00:02:39.940> we're<00:02:40.390> trying<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.750> uncover

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
107 or eight and we're trying to uncover

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.050 
107 or eight and we're trying to uncover
what<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.560> mechanisms<00:02:42.190> behind<00:02:42.340> that<00:02:42.730> are<00:02:42.879> we

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
what the mechanisms behind that are we

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.449 
what the mechanisms behind that are we
look<00:02:43.629> and<00:02:43.870> evaluate<00:02:43.989> muscle<00:02:44.920> function<00:02:45.340> we

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
look and evaluate muscle function we

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.280 
look and evaluate muscle function we
have<00:02:45.610> to<00:02:45.730> have<00:02:45.819> apparatus<00:02:46.510> to<00:02:46.690> isolate<00:02:47.260> that

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
have to have apparatus to isolate that

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.830 
have to have apparatus to isolate that
muscle<00:02:47.890> in<00:02:48.069> a<00:02:48.400> particular<00:02:49.090> contraction<00:02:49.720> that

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
muscle in a particular contraction that

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.690 
muscle in a particular contraction that
we're<00:02:49.989> interested<00:02:50.260> in<00:02:50.530> so<00:02:51.129> in<00:02:51.280> this<00:02:51.430> case

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
we're interested in so in this case

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.410 
we're interested in so in this case
we're<00:02:52.540> looking<00:02:52.720> at<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.769> shin<00:02:54.220> muscles<00:02:54.430> so

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
we're looking at the shin muscles so

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.289 
we're looking at the shin muscles so
when<00:02:55.629> we<00:02:55.870> flex<00:02:56.650> our<00:02:57.040> foot<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.700> raise<00:02:57.909> it<00:02:58.120> off

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
when we flex our foot to raise it off

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.449 
when we flex our foot to raise it off
the<00:02:58.540> ground<00:02:58.750> it's<00:02:59.440> our<00:02:59.650> muscles<00:03:00.010> in<00:03:00.099> the<00:03:00.220> shin

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
the ground it's our muscles in the shin

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.430 
the ground it's our muscles in the shin
back<00:03:00.670> contract<00:03:01.150> so<00:03:01.810> we<00:03:01.959> have<00:03:02.109> to<00:03:02.260> have<00:03:02.349> an

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
back contract so we have to have an

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.890 
back contract so we have to have an
apparatus<00:03:02.890> that<00:03:03.220> mimics<00:03:03.790> or<00:03:04.000> resist<00:03:04.629> that

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
apparatus that mimics or resist that

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.500 
apparatus that mimics or resist that
movement<00:03:05.470> so<00:03:06.040> that<00:03:06.250> we<00:03:06.400> can<00:03:06.579> evaluate<00:03:06.819> how

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
movement so that we can evaluate how

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.089 
movement so that we can evaluate how
hard<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.900> muscles<00:03:08.230> contracting<00:03:08.799> so<00:03:08.950> there

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
hard the muscles contracting so there

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.280 
hard the muscles contracting so there
usually<00:03:09.280> is<00:03:09.640> some<00:03:10.000> kind<00:03:10.359> of<00:03:10.450> load<00:03:10.720> cell<00:03:11.079> or

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
usually is some kind of load cell or

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.229 
usually is some kind of load cell or
force<00:03:11.709> sensor<00:03:12.129> associated<00:03:12.940> with<00:03:13.090> the

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
force sensor associated with the

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.990 
force sensor associated with the
apparatus<00:03:13.690> which<00:03:14.650> is<00:03:14.799> below<00:03:15.099> my<00:03:15.280> foot<00:03:15.579> so<00:03:15.790> what

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
apparatus which is below my foot so what

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.240 
apparatus which is below my foot so what
when<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:16.450> traitor<00:03:16.930> it<00:03:17.230> when<00:03:17.379> I<00:03:17.409> try<00:03:17.709> to<00:03:17.739> raise<00:03:18.010> my

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
when a traitor it when I try to raise my

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.020 
when a traitor it when I try to raise my
foot<00:03:18.840> it<00:03:19.980> activates<00:03:20.980> the<00:03:21.190> load<00:03:21.340> cell<00:03:21.640> beneath

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
foot it activates the load cell beneath

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.940 
foot it activates the load cell beneath
it<00:03:22.239> and<00:03:22.420> when<00:03:23.079> I<00:03:23.109> want<00:03:23.319> to<00:03:23.379> measure<00:03:23.530> muscle

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
it and when I want to measure muscle

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.830 
it and when I want to measure muscle
electrical<00:03:24.400> activity<00:03:24.879> I<00:03:25.060> have<00:03:25.329> electrodes

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
electrical activity I have electrodes

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.899 
electrical activity I have electrodes
such<00:03:26.109> as<00:03:26.290> these<00:03:26.530> and<00:03:26.739> I<00:03:27.190> place<00:03:27.459> it<00:03:27.640> right<00:03:27.849> on

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:27.909 
such as these and I place it right on

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:31.140 
such as these and I place it right on

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
your foot is placed in this apparatus

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.140 
your foot is placed in this apparatus
here<00:04:05.109> and<00:04:05.290> you<00:04:05.680> can<00:04:05.889> do<00:04:06.150> isometric

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
here and you can do isometric

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.659 
here and you can do isometric
dorsiflexion<00:04:08.019> contractions<00:04:08.769> which<00:04:09.400> means

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:09.669 
dorsiflexion contractions which means

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:11.580 
dorsiflexion contractions which means
that<00:04:09.819> when<00:04:10.359> you<00:04:10.510> lift<00:04:10.750> your<00:04:10.900> toe<00:04:11.109> up<00:04:11.349> it's

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
that when you lift your toe up it's

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.170 
that when you lift your toe up it's
actually<00:04:11.769> you're<00:04:12.250> not<00:04:12.340> actually<00:04:12.489> producing

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
actually you're not actually producing

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.909 
actually you're not actually producing
any<00:04:13.299> movement<00:04:13.780> you're<00:04:14.290> just<00:04:14.470> pulling<00:04:14.680> up

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:14.919 
any movement you're just pulling up

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:16.680 
any movement you're just pulling up
against<00:04:15.310> a<00:04:15.400> load<00:04:15.609> cell<00:04:15.849> which<00:04:16.120> records<00:04:16.570> your

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
against a load cell which records your

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.779 
against a load cell which records your
force<00:04:16.959> and<00:04:17.320> if<00:04:17.650> you<00:04:17.799> lift<00:04:18.039> your<00:04:18.160> foot<00:04:18.400> up<00:04:18.549> for

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
force and if you lift your foot up for

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:20.939 
force and if you lift your foot up for
us<00:04:18.940> and<00:04:19.180> kind<00:04:19.299> of<00:04:19.419> wiggle<00:04:19.599> it<00:04:19.900> you<00:04:20.470> can<00:04:20.620> see<00:04:20.829> the

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:20.949 
us and kind of wiggle it you can see the

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:23.070 
us and kind of wiggle it you can see the
force<00:04:21.250> trace<00:04:21.579> there<00:04:21.940> so<00:04:22.690> this<00:04:22.840> is<00:04:22.990> an

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
force trace there so this is an

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.689 
force trace there so this is an
oscilloscope<00:04:23.380> and<00:04:23.979> it<00:04:24.160> basically<00:04:24.340> just

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:24.699 
oscilloscope and it basically just

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:26.550 
oscilloscope and it basically just
allows<00:04:25.240> us<00:04:25.510> to<00:04:25.660> see<00:04:25.870> exactly<00:04:26.050> what's

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
allows us to see exactly what's

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.640 
allows us to see exactly what's
happening<00:04:27.010> in<00:04:27.190> real<00:04:27.400> time<00:04:27.460> and<00:04:28.440> that<00:04:29.440> just

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
happening in real time and that just

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.350 
happening in real time and that just
allows<00:04:29.889> us<00:04:29.949> to<00:04:30.130> be<00:04:30.310> able<00:04:30.370> to<00:04:30.550> record<00:04:30.880> things<00:04:31.150> as

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
allows us to be able to record things as

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.620 
allows us to be able to record things as
we<00:04:31.599> go<00:04:31.630> and<00:04:32.020> then<00:04:32.680> the<00:04:33.610> surface<00:04:33.970> EMG<00:04:34.120> that

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
we go and then the surface EMG that

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.020 
we go and then the surface EMG that
we're<00:04:34.780> putting<00:04:35.110> on<00:04:35.289> your<00:04:35.320> muscles<00:04:35.889> has<00:04:36.580> to<00:04:36.820> be

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
we're putting on your muscles has to be

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.200 
we're putting on your muscles has to be
amplified<00:04:37.860> so<00:04:38.860> all<00:04:39.310> of<00:04:39.370> that's<00:04:39.610> being<00:04:39.909> plugged

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
amplified so all of that's being plugged

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.780 
amplified so all of that's being plugged
into<00:04:40.419> our<00:04:40.719> top<00:04:40.990> row<00:04:41.320> of

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
into our top row of

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.450 
into our top row of
amplifiers<00:04:42.210> and<00:04:42.830> basically<00:04:43.830> that's<00:04:43.980> taking

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
amplifiers and basically that's taking

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.190 
amplifiers and basically that's taking
the<00:04:44.670> teeny<00:04:44.970> tiny<00:04:45.060> signal<00:04:45.660> which<00:04:46.020> is

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
the teeny tiny signal which is

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.620 
the teeny tiny signal which is
millivolts<00:04:46.950> and<00:04:47.130> it's<00:04:47.370> going<00:04:47.610> to<00:04:48.120> amplify<00:04:48.570> it

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
millivolts and it's going to amplify it

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.980 
millivolts and it's going to amplify it
so<00:04:48.810> that<00:04:48.900> we<00:04:48.990> can<00:04:49.140> actually<00:04:49.320> see<00:04:50.220> it<00:04:50.340> and

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
so that we can actually see it and

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.140 
so that we can actually see it and
quantify<00:04:51.990> it<00:04:52.020> and<00:04:52.470> as<00:04:53.100> well<00:04:53.310> we<00:04:53.550> have<00:04:53.760> a<00:04:53.790> course

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
quantify it and as well we have a course

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.330 
quantify it and as well we have a course
or<00:04:54.330> stimulation<00:04:54.780> unit<00:04:55.320> which<00:04:55.710> is<00:04:55.950> what<00:04:56.190> we<00:04:56.310> use

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
or stimulation unit which is what we use

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.150 
or stimulation unit which is what we use
to<00:04:56.820> shock<00:04:57.750> you<00:04:57.930> so<00:04:58.560> obviously<00:04:58.800> I<00:04:58.860> was<00:04:58.980> one<00:04:59.130> of

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
to shock you so obviously I was one of

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.790 
to shock you so obviously I was one of
the<00:04:59.280> best<00:04:59.400> participants<00:04:59.970> in<00:05:00.150> this<00:05:00.330> study

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
the best participants in this study

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.050 
the best participants in this study
let's<00:05:01.800> go<00:05:01.920> ahead<00:05:02.010> and<00:05:02.130> talk<00:05:02.640> about<00:05:02.850> my<00:05:02.910> results

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
let's go ahead and talk about my results

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.410 
let's go ahead and talk about my results
okay<00:05:03.600> so<00:05:03.720> this<00:05:04.080> is<00:05:04.320> the<00:05:05.250> entire<00:05:05.640> session<00:05:06.060> that

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420 
okay so this is the entire session that

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.750 
okay so this is the entire session that
we<00:05:06.540> did<00:05:06.720> today<00:05:06.900> each<00:05:07.650> of<00:05:07.980> these<00:05:08.220> are<00:05:08.610> the

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
we did today each of these are the

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.550 
we did today each of these are the
contractions<00:05:09.120> and<00:05:09.780> each<00:05:09.990> of<00:05:10.140> these<00:05:10.290> thin

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
contractions and each of these thin

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.470 
contractions and each of these thin
lines<00:05:10.800> that<00:05:11.070> you<00:05:11.100> see<00:05:11.190> here<00:05:11.760> are<00:05:11.970> the<00:05:12.090> twitches

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
lines that you see here are the twitches

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.810 
lines that you see here are the twitches
that<00:05:12.690> we<00:05:12.810> did<00:05:13.050> so<00:05:13.710> we<00:05:13.740> performed<00:05:14.340> some

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
that we did so we performed some

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.330 
that we did so we performed some
baseline<00:05:15.180> contractions<00:05:15.990> to<00:05:16.320> ensure<00:05:16.680> what<00:05:17.190> his

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
baseline contractions to ensure what his

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.580 
baseline contractions to ensure what his
maximal<00:05:17.820> was<00:05:18.000> then<00:05:18.780> this<00:05:18.930> was<00:05:19.080> his<00:05:19.230> fatigue

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
maximal was then this was his fatigue

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.100 
maximal was then this was his fatigue
series<00:05:20.040> and<00:05:20.370> you<00:05:20.520> can<00:05:20.640> sort<00:05:20.880> of<00:05:20.970> see<00:05:21.240> that<00:05:21.450> the

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
series and you can sort of see that the

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.770 
series and you can sort of see that the
force<00:05:22.380> declines<00:05:22.860> and<00:05:23.280> then<00:05:23.820> as<00:05:23.940> he<00:05:24.240> recovers<00:05:24.750> a

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
force declines and then as he recovers a

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.720 
force declines and then as he recovers a
little<00:05:25.110> bit<00:05:25.290> we<00:05:25.440> have<00:05:25.650> his<00:05:25.830> five<00:05:26.070> recovery

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 
little bit we have his five recovery

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.030 
little bit we have his five recovery
contractions<00:05:27.390> there<00:05:27.690> so<00:05:28.350> this<00:05:28.530> is<00:05:28.560> the<00:05:28.830> data

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040 
contractions there so this is the data

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.590 
contractions there so this is the data
that<00:05:29.310> we<00:05:29.370> will<00:05:29.640> use<00:05:30.890> to<00:05:31.890> basically<00:05:32.730> see<00:05:33.330> how<00:05:33.540> he

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
that we will use to basically see how he

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.470 
that we will use to basically see how he
did<00:05:33.990> fatiguing<00:05:34.950> and<00:05:35.100> recovering<00:05:35.490> and<00:05:35.790> if<00:05:36.330> we

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:36.480 
did fatiguing and recovering and if we

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.780 
did fatiguing and recovering and if we
zoom<00:05:36.510> in<00:05:36.930> here<00:05:36.990> you<00:05:37.860> can<00:05:38.010> actually<00:05:38.190> see<00:05:38.430> what

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
zoom in here you can actually see what

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.180 
zoom in here you can actually see what
an<00:05:38.880> individual<00:05:39.360> twitch<00:05:39.630> looks<00:05:39.900> like<00:05:40.140> so<00:05:40.980> we

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
an individual twitch looks like so we

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.090 
an individual twitch looks like so we
have<00:05:41.400> the<00:05:42.300> small<00:05:42.600> lift<00:05:43.020> and<00:05:43.230> force<00:05:43.500> and<00:05:43.860> we

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
have the small lift and force and we

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.990 
have the small lift and force and we
have<00:05:44.310> each<00:05:44.670> of<00:05:44.940> the<00:05:45.530> channels<00:05:46.670> that<00:05:47.670> have<00:05:47.730> been

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
have each of the channels that have been

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.170 
have each of the channels that have been
activated<00:05:48.330> by<00:05:49.230> the<00:05:49.260> twitch<00:05:49.880> so<00:05:50.880> I<00:05:50.940> just<00:05:51.030> want

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
activated by the twitch so I just want

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.610 
activated by the twitch so I just want
to<00:05:51.240> know<00:05:51.360> what<00:05:51.720> you<00:05:51.810> enjoy<00:05:51.960> most<00:05:52.080> about<00:05:52.440> your

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
to know what you enjoy most about your

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.000 
to know what you enjoy most about your
research<00:05:53.090> um<00:05:54.090> well<00:05:54.630> I<00:05:54.660> would<00:05:55.020> say<00:05:55.380> that<00:05:55.410> I

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.010 
research um well I would say that I

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.160 
research um well I would say that I
enjoy<00:05:56.490> the<00:05:56.940> fact<00:05:56.970> that<00:05:57.270> I<00:05:57.360> get<00:05:57.540> to<00:05:57.570> do<00:05:57.780> a<00:05:57.810> lot<00:05:57.990> of

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.170 
enjoy the fact that I get to do a lot of

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.800 
enjoy the fact that I get to do a lot of
different<00:05:58.260> things<00:05:58.560> so<00:05:59.400> of<00:05:59.610> course<00:05:59.760> I'm<00:06:00.120> you

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
different things so of course I'm you

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.100 
different things so of course I'm you
see<00:06:01.080> that<00:06:01.290> i'm<00:06:01.530> in<00:06:01.830> lab<00:06:02.190> testing<00:06:02.880> people<00:06:03.480> but

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
see that i'm in lab testing people but

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.050 
see that i'm in lab testing people but
obviously<00:06:04.920> there's<00:06:05.160> a<00:06:05.250> lot<00:06:05.400> behind<00:06:05.760> the

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 
obviously there's a lot behind the

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.360 
obviously there's a lot behind the
scenes<00:06:06.330> as<00:06:06.540> well<00:06:06.830> so<00:06:07.830> we<00:06:08.040> do<00:06:08.130> a<00:06:08.160> lot<00:06:08.310> of

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
scenes as well so we do a lot of

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.760 
scenes as well so we do a lot of
computer<00:06:08.790> programming<00:06:09.210> because<00:06:09.750> the<00:06:10.350> signals

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
computer programming because the signals

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.130 
computer programming because the signals
that<00:06:11.100> we<00:06:11.250> get<00:06:11.460> from<00:06:11.490> the<00:06:11.670> EMG<00:06:12.030> looks<00:06:12.930> like

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:13.140 
that we get from the EMG looks like

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.860 
that we get from the EMG looks like
squiggles<00:06:13.560> so<00:06:14.130> we<00:06:14.610> use<00:06:14.820> computer<00:06:15.240> programming

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
squiggles so we use computer programming

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.860 
squiggles so we use computer programming
to<00:06:16.080> break<00:06:16.440> those<00:06:16.650> down<00:06:16.710> and<00:06:17.660> we<00:06:18.660> write<00:06:18.840> our

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
to break those down and we write our

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.690 
to break those down and we write our
scripts<00:06:19.320> to<00:06:19.500> do<00:06:19.650> that<00:06:19.830> and<00:06:20.040> I<00:06:20.190> really<00:06:20.370> enjoy

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:20.700 
scripts to do that and I really enjoy

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.820 
scripts to do that and I really enjoy
that<00:06:20.730> and<00:06:21.180> then<00:06:21.720> of<00:06:21.840> course<00:06:22.050> you've<00:06:22.260> got<00:06:22.500> you

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
that and then of course you've got you

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.100 
that and then of course you've got you
know<00:06:22.860> the<00:06:23.100> statistics<00:06:23.280> behind<00:06:24.110> research

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
know the statistics behind research

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.110 
know the statistics behind research
we're<00:06:25.380> doing<00:06:25.410> quantitative<00:06:25.920> research<00:06:26.850> here

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
we're doing quantitative research here

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.000 
we're doing quantitative research here
and<00:06:27.300> so<00:06:27.990> that's<00:06:28.140> kind<00:06:28.320> of<00:06:28.380> the<00:06:28.530> point<00:06:28.710> that<00:06:28.890> I'm

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.010 
and so that's kind of the point that I'm

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:30.950 
and so that's kind of the point that I'm
getting<00:06:29.220> to<00:06:29.520> with<00:06:29.670> my<00:06:29.850> research<00:06:30.180> as<00:06:30.480> I<00:06:30.600> finish

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 
getting to with my research as I finish

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.330 
getting to with my research as I finish
up<00:06:31.110> and<00:06:32.210> luckily<00:06:33.210> I<00:06:33.450> enjoy<00:06:33.990> math<00:06:34.620> so<00:06:35.070> that's<00:06:35.250> a

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340 
up and luckily I enjoy math so that's a

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.350 
up and luckily I enjoy math so that's a
good<00:06:35.460> part<00:06:35.730> and<00:06:35.970> then<00:06:36.480> I<00:06:37.380> mean<00:06:37.890> obviously<00:06:38.360> data

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 
good part and then I mean obviously data

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.900 
good part and then I mean obviously data
collection<00:06:39.870> I<00:06:40.050> get<00:06:40.200> to<00:06:40.380> you<00:06:41.340> know<00:06:41.370> sit<00:06:41.760> and

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:41.910 
collection I get to you know sit and

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:44.510 
collection I get to you know sit and
talk<00:06:42.030> with<00:06:42.090> people<00:06:42.360> like<00:06:42.660> you<00:06:42.720> for<00:06:43.410> an<00:06:44.130> hour<00:06:44.280> a

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 
talk with people like you for an hour a

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.120 
talk with people like you for an hour a
day<00:06:44.760> for<00:06:44.970> three<00:06:45.450> days<00:06:45.660> so<00:06:46.080> what<00:06:46.890> could<00:06:47.010> be

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.130 
day for three days so what could be

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.450 
day for three days so what could be
better<00:06:47.690> your<00:06:48.690> supervisor<00:06:49.200> David<00:06:50.010> Gabriel

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460 
better your supervisor David Gabriel

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:28.470 
to be a mentor and to do research and to

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:30.920 
to be a mentor and to do research and to
teach<00:07:28.770> and<00:07:29.160> he<00:07:29.730> just<00:07:29.970> brings<00:07:30.210> enjoyment<00:07:30.690> to

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:30.930 
teach and he just brings enjoyment to

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:32.690 
teach and he just brings enjoyment to
the<00:07:31.110> fields<00:07:31.440> but<00:07:31.770> that<00:07:32.100> is<00:07:32.190> all<00:07:32.340> time<00:07:32.520> we<00:07:32.610> have

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:32.700 
the fields but that is all time we have

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.210 
the fields but that is all time we have
today<00:07:32.850> on<00:07:32.970> the<00:07:33.030> focus<00:07:33.210> I<00:07:33.980> just<00:07:34.980> want<00:07:35.100> to<00:07:35.160> make

today on the focus I just want to make
sure<00:07:35.280> everyone's<00:07:35.700> aware<00:07:35.910> that<00:07:36.150> no<00:07:36.330> one's<00:07:36.510> hurt

all me and it was all in the name of

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.720 
all me and it was all in the name of
science<00:07:42.300> but<00:07:43.260> just<00:07:43.470> to<00:07:43.530> make<00:07:43.650> sure<00:07:43.680> it's<00:07:44.130> a

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:44.730 
science but just to make sure it's a

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:49.510 
science but just to make sure it's a
little<00:07:44.880> bit<00:07:45.000> of<00:07:45.060> payback<00:07:45.180> time
