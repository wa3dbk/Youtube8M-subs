take a look at the Incipio NGP flexible
impact<00:00:20.039> resistant<00:00:20.520> case<00:00:20.730> for<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.090> iPhone<00:00:21.420> 6

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
impact resistant case for the iPhone 6

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.990 
impact resistant case for the iPhone 6
plus<00:00:21.990> this<00:00:22.890> case<00:00:23.220> has<00:00:23.580> an<00:00:23.910> MSRP<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.689> just

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
plus this case has an MSRP of just

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.790 
plus this case has an MSRP of just
$19.99<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.300> it's<00:00:27.779> available<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.410> six

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
$19.99 and it's available in six

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.040 
$19.99 and it's available in six
different<00:00:29.130> colors<00:00:29.789> we<00:00:30.330> obviously<00:00:30.480> have<00:00:31.019> the

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
different colors we obviously have the

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.620 
different colors we obviously have the
translucent<00:00:31.920> blue<00:00:32.189> case<00:00:32.550> here<00:00:33.030> so<00:00:33.180> why<00:00:33.510> don't

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
translucent blue case here so why don't

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.970 
translucent blue case here so why don't
we<00:00:33.660> crack<00:00:33.899> open<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.320> package<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.829> take<00:00:34.920> a

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
we crack open the package and take a

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.090 
we crack open the package and take a
look<00:00:35.190> at<00:00:35.309> what's<00:00:35.460> inside<00:00:36.770> incipio<00:00:37.770> has<00:00:37.950> made

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
look at what's inside incipio has made

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.619 
look at what's inside incipio has made
opening<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.550> package<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.030> very<00:00:39.210> very<00:00:39.420> easy

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
opening the package is very very easy

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.020 
opening the package is very very easy
they<00:00:40.290> just<00:00:40.320> simply<00:00:40.739> lift<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.640> can<00:00:41.790> then

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
they just simply lift and you can then

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.860 
they just simply lift and you can then
pull<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.170> case<00:00:43.379> out<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.850> package<00:00:45.239> like<00:00:45.510> so

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
pull the case out of the package like so

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.229 
pull the case out of the package like so
as<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.620> can<00:00:46.770> see<00:00:46.980> inside<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.579> package<00:00:47.940> you

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
as you can see inside the package you

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.430 
as you can see inside the package you
get<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.719> case<00:00:48.899> itself<00:00:50.840> you<00:00:51.840> get<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.050> little<00:00:52.320> bit

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
get the case itself you get a little bit

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.310 
get the case itself you get a little bit
of<00:00:52.530> literature<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.190> that's<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.719> case<00:00:55.140> is

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
of literature and that's it the case is

the phone so let's take my iphone
six-plus<00:01:17.610> pop<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.330> inside<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.900> see<00:01:19.439> whether

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
six-plus pop it inside and see whether

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.399 
six-plus pop it inside and see whether
or<00:01:19.740> not<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.220> good<00:01:20.430> option<00:01:20.640> for<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.409> so

or not this is a good option for you so

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.030 
or not this is a good option for you so
here<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.860> my<00:01:23.130> iphone<00:01:23.850> six-plus

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
here is my iphone six-plus

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.260 
here is my iphone six-plus
taking<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.310> putting<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.850> side<00:01:27.060> with

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
taking it and putting in the side with

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.469 
taking it and putting in the side with
the<00:01:27.360> three<00:01:27.600> buttons<00:01:28.670> volume<00:01:29.670> up<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:29.970> down<00:01:30.119> and

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
the three buttons volume up and down and

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.219 
the three buttons volume up and down and
mute<00:01:31.259> toggle<00:01:31.500> pop<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.640> inside<00:01:33.020> so<00:01:34.020> what<00:01:34.140> you

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
mute toggle pop it inside so what you

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.140 
mute toggle pop it inside so what you
get<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.560> nicely<00:01:35.220> on<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.430> table<00:01:35.670> protection

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
get is nicely on the table protection

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.420 
get is nicely on the table protection
the<00:01:36.299> case<00:01:36.479> comes<00:01:36.810> up<00:01:37.020> around<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.680> entire<00:01:38.040> face

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
the case comes up around the entire face

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.660 
the case comes up around the entire face
of<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:39.270> iPhone<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.320> does<00:01:40.650> not<00:01:40.860> really<00:01:41.250> get<00:01:41.520> in

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
of the iPhone it does not really get in

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.060 
of the iPhone it does not really get in
the<00:01:41.759> way<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:41.939> accessing<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.079> screen<00:01:43.470> but<00:01:44.009> you

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
the way of accessing the screen but you

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.560 
the way of accessing the screen but you
do<00:01:44.340> have<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.579> little<00:01:44.759> bit<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.060> lip<00:01:45.240> here<00:01:45.390> so

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
do have a little bit of a lip here so

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.560 
do have a little bit of a lip here so
you<00:01:45.630> don't<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.259> do<00:01:46.409> lose<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:47.009> nice<00:01:47.640> seamless

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
you don't you do lose that nice seamless

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.039 
you don't you do lose that nice seamless
flow<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.070> screen<00:01:50.970> since<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.509> display<00:01:51.869> now

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
flow of the screen since the display now

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.069 
flow of the screen since the display now
actually<00:01:52.470> comes<00:01:52.710> down<00:01:52.799> at<00:01:53.310> an<00:01:53.970> angle<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.869> here

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
actually comes down at an angle so here

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.660 
actually comes down at an angle so here
on<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.259> back<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.470> get<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.040> incipio<00:01:56.460> name

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
on the back you get the incipio name

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.370 
on the back you get the incipio name
here<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.180> translucent<00:01:57.719> material<00:01:58.079> it's<00:01:58.200> the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
here the translucent material it's the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.440 
here the translucent material it's the
iPhone<00:01:58.829> name<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.549> iPhone<00:01:59.850> Apple<00:02:00.090> come

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
iPhone name and the iPhone Apple come

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
this slightly soft touch material it's a

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.589 
this slightly soft touch material it's a

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
shiny NGP material and it goes in line

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.390 
shiny NGP material and it goes in line
with<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.200> antenna<00:02:25.650> line<00:02:25.860> here<00:02:26.040> at<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:26.220> top

with the antenna line here at the top
it's<00:02:26.849> also<00:02:27.060> worth<00:02:27.300> noting<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.780> antenna

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
it's also worth noting that the antenna

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.270 
it's also worth noting that the antenna
line<00:02:28.349> comes<00:02:28.590> through<00:02:28.770> here<00:02:28.950> in<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.069> back
