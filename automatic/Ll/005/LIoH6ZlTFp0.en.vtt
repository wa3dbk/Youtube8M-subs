this<00:00:02.250> is<00:00:02.580> my<00:00:03.920> point<00:00:04.920> zero<00:00:05.370> five<00:00:05.700> micron<00:00:06.799> axial

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.210 
this is my point zero five micron axial

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:21.560 
this is my point zero five micron axial
with<00:00:09.210> my<00:00:09.570> standard<00:00:11.690> wheel<00:00:18.230> lathe<00:00:19.230> wheel<00:00:20.570> and

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
with my standard wheel lathe wheel and

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.450 
with my standard wheel lathe wheel and
right<00:00:21.750> now<00:00:21.900> I'm<00:00:22.080> packing<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.980> head<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.310> the

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
right now I'm packing the head of the

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.320 
right now I'm packing the head of the
graphite<00:00:24.170> very<00:00:25.170> simple<00:00:25.680> technique<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.460> take

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
graphite very simple technique I take

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.210 
graphite very simple technique I take
some<00:00:27.539> graphite<00:00:27.990> introduce<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.680> into<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.920> hub

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
some graphite introduce it into the hub

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.750 
some graphite introduce it into the hub
take<00:00:30.210> my<00:00:30.420> graphite<00:00:30.960> Packer<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:32.750> pack<00:00:33.750> it

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
take my graphite Packer and pack it

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:46.950 
take my graphite Packer and pack it
introduce<00:00:35.760> some<00:00:35.969> more<00:00:36.000> graphite

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.210 

and<00:00:47.200> we<00:00:47.920> continue<00:00:48.310> this<00:00:48.400> process<00:00:48.460> until<00:00:48.910> ups

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220 
and we continue this process until ups

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:59.400 
and we continue this process until ups
until<00:00:51.220> I<00:00:51.400> get<00:00:52.380> desired<00:00:54.840> firmness<00:00:55.840> I<00:00:58.410> didn't

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
until I get desired firmness I didn't

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.280 
until I get desired firmness I didn't
want<00:00:59.530> to<00:00:59.590> round<00:00:59.710> my<00:00:59.860> hub<00:01:00.330> this<00:01:01.330> isn't<00:01:01.840> any

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
want to round my hub this isn't any

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.010 
want to round my hub this isn't any
ordinary<00:01:02.530> graphite<00:01:03.250> this<00:01:03.520> is<00:01:03.730> actually<00:01:04.210> some

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.020 
ordinary graphite this is actually some

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.310 
ordinary graphite this is actually some
industrial<00:01:05.650> grade<00:01:05.830> lubricant<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:07.540> is<00:01:07.750> 300

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
industrial grade lubricant it is 300

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.410 
industrial grade lubricant it is 300
mesh<00:01:08.560> I<00:01:09.479> think<00:01:10.479> the<00:01:10.630> local<00:01:10.869> the<00:01:11.350> local<00:01:12.250> guys

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.390 

get<00:01:16.420> up<00:01:16.570> to<00:01:16.720> 200<00:01:16.930> mesh<00:01:17.350> 300<00:01:18.010> mesh<00:01:18.100> is<00:01:18.220> much

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
get up to 200 mesh 300 mesh is much

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.749 
get up to 200 mesh 300 mesh is much
finer<00:01:18.670> it's<00:01:19.570> easier<00:01:19.990> to<00:01:20.170> pack<00:01:20.440> and<00:01:21.190> it<00:01:21.670> will

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
finer it's easier to pack and it will

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:27.930 
finer it's easier to pack and it will
actually<00:01:21.940> stay<00:01:22.240> nice<00:01:22.509> and<00:01:24.960> firm<00:01:26.640> if<00:01:27.640> you<00:01:27.790> can

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
actually stay nice and firm if you can

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.740 
actually stay nice and firm if you can
tell<00:01:28.149> it's<00:01:28.360> almost<00:01:28.509> the<00:01:28.750> consistency<00:01:28.899> of<00:01:29.470> talc

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
tell it's almost the consistency of talc

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.840 
tell it's almost the consistency of talc
pretty<00:01:31.750> fine<00:01:35.160> and<00:01:36.160> I'm<00:01:36.250> going<00:01:36.399> to<00:01:36.490> pack<00:01:36.700> this

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
pretty fine and I'm going to pack this

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.389 
pretty fine and I'm going to pack this
probably<00:01:37.240> one<00:01:37.360> more<00:01:37.420> time<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:39.369> just

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
probably one more time and just

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.969 
probably one more time and just
compressing<00:01:40.119> it

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.350 

yeah<00:01:44.549> I'm<00:01:44.759> got<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.090> nice<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.470> tight<00:01:46.470> now<00:01:47.360> and

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
yeah I'm got it nice and tight now and

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.410 
yeah I'm got it nice and tight now and
the<00:01:48.450> cool<00:01:48.659> thing<00:01:48.689> about<00:01:48.900> this<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.650> that

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
the cool thing about this is is that

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.020 
the cool thing about this is is that
once<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.570> do<00:01:51.630> do<00:01:51.930> this<00:01:52.640> there's<00:01:53.640> one<00:01:53.729> good

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
once I do do this there's one good

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.590 
once I do do this there's one good
packing<00:01:54.450> it'll<00:01:54.659> last<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:56.060> good<00:01:57.060> seven<00:01:57.479> eight

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
packing it'll last a good seven eight

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.960 
packing it'll last a good seven eight
nine<00:01:57.780> races

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
nine races

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:07.460 
nine races
I<00:02:00.000> haven't<00:02:00.570> any<00:02:00.690> problem<00:02:01.049> with<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:06.350> lot<00:02:07.350> of

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
I haven't any problem with that a lot of

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.750 
I haven't any problem with that a lot of
extra<00:02:08.780> graphite<00:02:09.780> in<00:02:09.899> there<00:02:10.140> as<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:11.039> can<00:02:11.069> see

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.370 

it'll<00:02:14.760> pretty<00:02:14.970> much<00:02:15.060> spend<00:02:18.080> nice<00:02:19.080> and

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
it'll pretty much spend nice and

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:26.210 
it'll pretty much spend nice and
resistant<00:02:19.860> free

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.000 

not<00:02:26.730> too<00:02:26.910> much<00:02:27.060> wobbling<00:02:27.860> that's<00:02:28.860> what

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
not too much wobbling that's what

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.010 
not too much wobbling that's what
happens<00:02:29.310> when<00:02:29.400> you're<00:02:29.520> able<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:29.840> pack<00:02:30.840> that

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
happens when you're able to pack that

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:41.500 
happens when you're able to pack that
extra<00:02:34.310> eighth<00:02:35.310> of<00:02:35.610> an<00:02:35.730> inch<00:02:35.850> on<00:02:36.060> that<00:02:36.240> hub

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.170 

anyway<00:02:42.920> that's<00:02:43.920> what<00:02:44.100> I<00:02:44.130> have<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.460> show<00:02:44.610> you<00:02:44.670> if

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
anyway that's what I have to show you if

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.990 
anyway that's what I have to show you if
you're<00:02:45.390> interested<00:02:45.750> let<00:02:45.780> me<00:02:45.900> know
