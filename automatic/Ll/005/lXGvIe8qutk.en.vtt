 I worked for that 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:21.599

 since that date the rewards of working between 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.789
 resuming an existing activity is easier because you do not 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.139
 know where we put our feet 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:11.840
 after holding 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.749
 besides everything that brings us I think that 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:18.519
 do not hesitate, try it afterwards if it does not work out 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.719
 anyone will have at least tried a moment to pass 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:25.939

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:28.749
 and today I am contacted 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:31.769
 so for me I will spend to motivate every year 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.879
 although it is in the field of health to the point 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.239
 and signed and utilitarian or will it work and it does not work and 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.349
 pass to his experience and an experience is always profitable
