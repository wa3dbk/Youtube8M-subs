00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.269
 Mmmm 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:30.770
 The backhand volley is too expensive on the wrist and the room is the same as the forehand 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:39.040
 Image take-back as well so as not too much in the back of yourself too much of the body to harden 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:47.340
 Hey I have been careful it from the rest is a little longer after the hit in order to suppress the opening of the body 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:52.640
 I think that it is easy to understand because the opening of the body is suppressed if you have an image that raises your face 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:58.460
 Then I will enter a good house to keep 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:02.890
 In the case of a kange volley, at the ball where the left foot flew 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:09.350
 If you hit an image that matches it, it may be easy to understand 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:12.220
 The basic point of the backhand low volley is also the forehand low volley 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:18.970
 Also I'd become the same 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:19.930
 Broken the body and the trajectory of the high-ball tries to align the eyes it be passed through the becomes lower 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:26.440
 Because it will 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:30.480
 It is a little hard because it is connected to the cause of the water of wind soo, but it is a bit difficult 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:35.550
 Move firmly in front of you 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:38.970
 Then I also will come to must be called head 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:44.340
 I do volley with both hands during long run 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.490
 A little bit of power now or a woman 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:54.250
 a 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:59.250
 Until the moment you hit it, if you put the left hand and hit using the left hand's force, the force against the ball 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:06.180
 I think that a good go easy in Robore in the less likely to lose 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:11.070
 The four backhand dry cases are the same as other strokes and swimming volleyballs. 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:15.180
 I am particularly conscious of the load of touch until the last minute 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:23.520
 In the case of a high backhand hit 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:26.170
 It is a shot that is not the dominant arm compared to sales, so it is difficult to get a little power so much 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.040
 Don't get too high 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:34.709
 Even if you get above your shoulder 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.120
 It is completely cured at 9:00 pm and power is hard to come in and it is possible to touch firmly to the end 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:42.390
 Because I can not 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:45.780
 A place where my power comes in more carefully than at the time of forehand drive thanks 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:53.940
 Just like you can hit at height 1 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:55.230
 I try to be careful and hit carefully so that I move finely carefully than the forehand 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.540
 Hmm 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.659
 Hmm 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.659
 Minutes 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.750
 2 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.060
 me 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.360
 Hmm 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.360
 me 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.360
 Hmm
