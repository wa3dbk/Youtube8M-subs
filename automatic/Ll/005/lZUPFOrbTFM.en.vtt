00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
little drop by roys some grog covers and

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.910 
little drop by roys some grog covers and
you<00:02:54.100> don't<00:02:55.100> normally<00:02:55.490> say<00:02:55.760> him<00:02:55.910> with<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:57.410> the

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
you don't normally say him with the the

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.890 
you don't normally say him with the the
tie-downs<00:02:58.430> I<00:02:58.610> had<00:02:58.760> to<00:02:58.970> put<00:02:59.240> my<00:02:59.270> own<00:02:59.510> spin<00:02:59.840> on

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
tie-downs I had to put my own spin on

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.360 
tie-downs I had to put my own spin on
them<00:03:00.230> and<00:03:00.440> like<00:03:01.100> special<00:03:02.090> stainless<00:03:02.960> steel

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
them and like special stainless steel

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.630 
them and like special stainless steel
little<00:03:04.370> high<00:03:04.640> rises<00:03:05.180> in<00:03:05.450> here<00:03:05.780> to<00:03:06.320> get<00:03:07.280> the

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
little high rises in here to get the

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.780 
little high rises in here to get the
delayed<00:03:08.600> holders<00:03:09.160> up<00:03:10.160> off<00:03:10.460> the<00:03:10.730> manifold

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.210 

so

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.570 

the<00:03:18.360> it's<00:03:19.360> just<00:03:19.660> got<00:03:20.260> a<00:03:20.290> bug<00:03:20.560> killer<00:03:20.830> as<00:03:21.400> I<00:03:21.520> said

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
the it's just got a bug killer as I said

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.370 
the it's just got a bug killer as I said
before<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:22.470> forced<00:03:23.470> induction<00:03:23.970> blower<00:03:25.380> it

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
before the forced induction blower it

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.110 
before the forced induction blower it
runs<00:03:27.310> quite<00:03:27.640> well<00:03:27.850> actually<00:03:28.060> if<00:03:29.610> we<00:03:30.610> don't

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
runs quite well actually if we don't

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.360 
runs quite well actually if we don't
usually<00:03:31.390> have<00:03:31.750> any<00:03:31.930> problems<00:03:32.320> with<00:03:32.410> it<00:03:32.530> it's<00:03:33.100> a

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
usually have any problems with it it's a

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.800 
usually have any problems with it it's a
quite<00:03:35.030> good<00:03:36.010> and<00:03:37.010> we'll<00:03:37.540> start<00:03:38.540> it<00:03:38.659> up<00:03:38.690> and

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
quite good and we'll start it up and

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.240 
quite good and we'll start it up and
give<00:03:38.959> you<00:03:39.049> a<00:03:39.080> bit<00:03:39.230> of<00:03:39.260> a<00:03:39.349> listen<00:03:39.650> to<00:03:39.769> it<00:03:39.890> it's

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
give you a bit of a listen to it it's

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.149 
give you a bit of a listen to it it's
got<00:03:40.400> straight<00:03:40.700> cut<00:03:40.940> gears<00:03:41.180> in<00:03:41.480> it<00:03:41.599> and<00:03:42.159> makes

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:43.159 
got straight cut gears in it and makes

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:57.140 
got straight cut gears in it and makes
it<00:03:43.250> pretty<00:03:43.400> awesome<00:03:43.849> sand

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150
