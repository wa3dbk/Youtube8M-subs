show to this in the US I'm not sure what
I<00:02:29.400> think<00:02:29.459> about<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:30.030> because<00:02:30.360> this<00:02:30.599> one's

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
I think about that because this one's

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.759

really<00:02:30.930> good<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.290> I<00:02:31.349> don't<00:02:31.409> think<00:02:31.680> they

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
really good and I don't think they

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.410 
really good and I don't think they
really<00:02:31.950> need<00:02:32.159> to<00:02:32.280> make<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:32.459> US<00:02:32.819> version<00:02:33.030> but

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
really need to make a US version but

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.170 
really need to make a US version but
it's<00:02:34.260> all<00:02:34.409> right<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.799> the<00:02:35.610> next<00:02:35.790> honorable

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180

like<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.269> show<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:39.480> think<00:02:39.599> it's<00:02:39.870> great<00:02:40.140> drama

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
like the show I think it's great drama

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.860 
like the show I think it's great drama
and<00:02:40.920> this<00:02:41.549> past<00:02:41.790> season<00:02:42.000> I<00:02:42.269> thought<00:02:42.299> was

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
and this past season I thought was

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.350 
and this past season I thought was
pretty<00:02:43.200> underwhelming<00:02:43.980> compared<00:02:44.819> to<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.060> the

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
pretty underwhelming compared to the the

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.990 
pretty underwhelming compared to the the
first<00:02:45.629> um<00:02:46.049> I<00:02:46.650> think<00:02:47.129> it<00:02:47.190> was<00:02:47.280> four<00:02:47.549> seasons

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
first um I think it was four seasons

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.119 
first um I think it was four seasons
what<00:02:48.810> it<00:02:48.959> was<00:02:49.049> the<00:02:49.410> first<00:02:49.590> four<00:02:49.739> seasons<00:02:49.890> were

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
what it was the first four seasons were

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.069 
what it was the first four seasons were
great<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:50.879> then<00:02:51.000> season<00:02:51.269> five<00:02:51.420> kind<00:02:51.720> of<00:02:51.810> dip

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
great and then season five kind of dip

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.900 
great and then season five kind of dip
down<00:02:52.260> hill<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:52.799> then<00:02:53.400> there's<00:02:53.549> one<00:02:53.760> more

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
down hill and then there's one more

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.640 
down hill and then there's one more
honorable<00:02:54.329> mention<00:02:54.690> here<00:02:54.900> and<00:02:55.049> I<00:02:55.109> know<00:02:55.170> for

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
honorable mention here and I know for

honorable mention here and I know for
most<00:02:55.739> people<00:02:56.099> this<00:02:56.190> is<00:02:56.340> probably<00:02:56.609> in<00:02:57.510> your<00:02:57.569> top

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
three but for me it's only an honorable

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.069 
three but for me it's only an honorable
mention<00:03:00.859> it's<00:03:01.859> the<00:03:02.069> walking<00:03:02.459> dead<00:03:02.670> um<00:03:02.879> if<00:03:03.599> you

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.500 
mention it's the walking dead um if you

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
asked me after season one what my top

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.210 
asked me after season one what my top
ten<00:03:06.720> shows<00:03:06.900> would<00:03:07.109> wear<00:03:07.500> this<00:03:08.040> would

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
ten shows would wear this would

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.330 
ten shows would wear this would
definitely<00:03:08.400> be<00:03:08.760> way<00:03:09.150> higher<00:03:09.470> but<00:03:10.470> they<00:03:10.980> fired

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
definitely be way higher but they fired

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.880 
definitely be way higher but they fired
Frank<00:03:11.609> Darabont<00:03:12.150> which<00:03:12.329> I<00:03:12.420> think<00:03:12.629> was<00:03:12.720> a<00:03:12.890> bump

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
Frank Darabont which I think was a bump

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.720 
Frank Darabont which I think was a bump
it's<00:03:14.069> just<00:03:14.430> a<00:03:14.579> stupid<00:03:15.510> move<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.579> season<00:03:17.579> two

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
it's just a stupid move and season two

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.900 
it's just a stupid move and season two
was<00:03:18.090> totally<00:03:18.690> not<00:03:19.349> even<00:03:19.620> close<00:03:19.980> to<00:03:20.280> season<00:03:20.730> one

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
was totally not even close to season one

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.789 
was totally not even close to season one
I<00:03:21.150> know<00:03:21.209> I've<00:03:21.720> said<00:03:21.989> this<00:03:22.049> before<00:03:22.169> and<00:03:22.620> some

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
I know I've said this before and some

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.819 
I know I've said this before and some
people<00:03:23.040> took<00:03:23.400> offense<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:23.880> it<00:03:24.030> but<00:03:24.359> it's<00:03:25.169> twice

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
people took offense to it but it's twice

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.420 
people took offense to it but it's twice
as<00:03:25.859> many<00:03:26.190> episodes<00:03:26.819> for<00:03:27.480> us<00:03:28.040> less<00:03:29.040> money<00:03:29.340> than

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
as many episodes for us less money than

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.039 
as many episodes for us less money than
they<00:03:29.639> spent<00:03:29.910> on<00:03:30.030> season<00:03:30.389> one<00:03:30.569> and<00:03:30.599> then<00:03:30.870> you

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
they spent on season one and then you

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.589 
they spent on season one and then you
fire<00:03:31.319> your<00:03:31.760> Academy<00:03:32.760> Award<00:03:33.060> nominated

director<00:03:33.900> and<00:03:34.500> writer<00:03:34.530> I<00:03:35.040> think<00:03:35.790> that's<00:03:35.910> not<00:03:36.150> a

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
director and writer I think that's not a

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.610 
director and writer I think that's not a
very<00:03:36.329> smart<00:03:36.510> move<00:03:36.780> and<00:03:36.959> I<00:03:37.079> think<00:03:37.290> that's<00:03:37.440> why

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
very smart move and I think that's why

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.129 
very smart move and I think that's why
