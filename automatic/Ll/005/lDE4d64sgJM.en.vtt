good<00:02:31.190> as<00:02:31.430> Donkey<00:02:31.730> Kong<00:02:31.910> Country<00:02:32.090> I<00:02:32.480> will<00:02:32.959> say

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
good as Donkey Kong Country I will say

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.660 
good as Donkey Kong Country I will say
that<00:02:33.290> it's<00:02:33.440> still<00:02:33.650> fun<00:02:33.829> to<00:02:33.859> tell<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.220> play<00:02:34.400> and

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
that it's still fun to tell the play and

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.250 
that it's still fun to tell the play and
it<00:02:34.970> looks<00:02:35.120> really<00:02:35.359> good<00:02:35.510> for<00:02:35.690> a<00:02:35.750> Genesis<00:02:36.140> game

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.580 

at<00:02:42.260> least<00:02:42.410> I<00:02:42.590> think<00:02:42.889> so<00:02:44.260> also<00:02:45.260> this<00:02:45.350> stitch

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
at least I think so also this stitch

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:55.809 
at least I think so also this stitch
powerup<00:02:45.980> is<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.519> cat's<00:02:46.730> pajamas<00:02:54.670> alright<00:02:55.670> so

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
powerup is the cat's pajamas alright so

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.910 
powerup is the cat's pajamas alright so
vector<00:02:56.000> man<00:02:56.239> can't<00:02:56.569> drown<00:02:56.840> but<00:02:57.620> he<00:02:57.739> is

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
vector man can't drown but he is

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.650 
vector man can't drown but he is
affected<00:02:58.370> by<00:02:58.489> the<00:02:58.549> water<00:02:58.790> in<00:02:59.060> that<00:02:59.239> it<00:02:59.359> slows

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
affected by the water in that it slows

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.170 
affected by the water in that it slows
him<00:02:59.810> down<00:02:59.840> there's<00:03:00.709> like<00:03:00.859> any<00:03:00.920> like<00:03:01.250> okay<00:03:01.670> that

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
him down there's like any like okay that

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.479 
him down there's like any like okay that
kind<00:03:02.930> of<00:03:02.959> water<00:03:03.200> physics<00:03:03.440> turn<00:03:03.829> in

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.440 

it<00:03:08.489> almost<00:03:08.790> pretty<00:03:08.969> cool<00:03:09.090> if<00:03:09.180> you're<00:03:09.269> near

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
it almost pretty cool if you're near

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.940 
it almost pretty cool if you're near
enemies<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:09.870> blow<00:03:10.379> up<00:03:10.500> everything<00:03:10.680> on<00:03:10.890> the

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
enemies to blow up everything on the

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:18.039 
enemies to blow up everything on the
moon

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.479 

alright<00:03:19.049> this<00:03:19.200> powerup<00:03:19.560> is<00:03:19.799> pretty<00:03:20.129> nifty

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
alright this powerup is pretty nifty

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.849 
alright this powerup is pretty nifty
it<00:03:20.700> is<00:03:20.819> the<00:03:21.030> atomic<00:03:21.329> bomb<00:03:21.689> you<00:03:22.560> pretty<00:03:22.739> much

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
it is the atomic bomb you pretty much

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.559 
it is the atomic bomb you pretty much
have<00:03:23.069> this<00:03:23.189> charge<00:03:23.489> with<00:03:23.760> you<00:03:23.909> and<00:03:24.120> you<00:03:24.420> can

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
have this charge with you and you can

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.259 
have this charge with you and you can
set<00:03:24.780> it<00:03:24.870> off<00:03:24.959> whenever<00:03:25.170> you<00:03:25.319> want<00:03:26.060> and<00:03:27.060> it

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
set it off whenever you want and it

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:28.629 
set it off whenever you want and it
kills<00:03:27.510> everything<00:03:27.750> on<00:03:27.959> the<00:03:28.019> screen

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639 
kills everything on the screen

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:41.649 
kills everything on the screen
unfortunately<00:03:29.639> I<00:03:29.670> just<00:03:30.950> on<00:03:31.950> that<00:03:32.189> one<00:03:32.489> turrets

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:41.659 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:43.940 

alright<00:03:42.659> so<00:03:42.780> here<00:03:42.989> is<00:03:43.019> the<00:03:43.290> exploit<00:03:43.739> that<00:03:43.859> I'm

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
alright so here is the exploit that I'm

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.399 
alright so here is the exploit that I'm
talking<00:03:44.159> about<00:03:44.549> earlier<00:03:45.299> in<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.540> level<00:03:45.840> see

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:46.409 
talking about earlier in the level see

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:49.159 
talking about earlier in the level see
how<00:03:46.560> now<00:03:46.709> I<00:03:46.739> have<00:03:47.010> a<00:03:47.040> 10x<00:03:47.639> multiplier<00:03:48.239> that's<00:03:48.989> a

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.169 
how now I have a 10x multiplier that's a

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:52.819 
how now I have a 10x multiplier that's a
pretty<00:03:49.409> huge<00:03:49.799> multiplier<00:03:50.750> and<00:03:51.750> earlier<00:03:52.680> in

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
pretty huge multiplier and earlier in

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.470 
pretty huge multiplier and earlier in
this<00:03:52.919> level<00:03:53.250> there<00:03:53.400> is<00:03:53.430> a<00:03:53.579> 1up<00:03:54.180> that<00:03:54.450> I

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
this level there is a 1up that I

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.740 
this level there is a 1up that I
actually<00:03:54.750> didn't<00:03:55.230> grab<00:03:55.409> now<00:03:56.419> 1ups<00:03:57.419> are<00:03:57.599> also

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
actually didn't grab now 1ups are also

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.720 
actually didn't grab now 1ups are also
subject<00:03:58.379> to<00:03:58.439> the<00:03:58.560> multipliers<00:03:59.069> so<00:03:59.430> you<00:03:59.489> can

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
subject to the multipliers so you can

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.000 
subject to the multipliers so you can
see<00:03:59.849> where<00:04:00.000> this<00:04:00.060> is<00:04:00.239> going<00:04:00.540> if<00:04:01.290> you<00:04:01.560> can<00:04:01.739> race

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
see where this is going if you can race

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.860 
see where this is going if you can race
yourself<00:04:02.430> back<00:04:02.669> to<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.359> 1up<00:04:05.480> time<00:04:06.480> runs<00:04:06.719> out

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
yourself back to the 1up time runs out

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.490 
yourself back to the 1up time runs out
with<00:04:07.049> it's<00:04:07.260> an<00:04:07.379> X<00:04:07.500> multiplier<00:04:08.090> yes<00:04:09.500> that's

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
with it's an X multiplier yes that's

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.680 
with it's an X multiplier yes that's
right<00:04:10.739> 10<00:04:11.250> lives<00:04:11.549> holy

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
right 10 lives holy

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.979 
right 10 lives holy
so<00:04:12.900> we<00:04:13.169> have<00:04:13.290> 16<00:04:13.709> lives<00:04:13.979> and<00:04:14.569> trust<00:04:15.569> me<00:04:15.780> I'm

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
so we have 16 lives and trust me I'm

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.680 
so we have 16 lives and trust me I'm
probably<00:04:16.199> gonna<00:04:16.470> need<00:04:16.560> most<00:04:16.859> of<00:04:17.070> them<00:04:17.510> to<00:04:18.510> get

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
probably gonna need most of them to get

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.140 
probably gonna need most of them to get
through<00:04:18.810> this<00:04:18.989> alive<00:04:19.549> my<00:04:20.549> sanity<00:04:20.940> still

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
through this alive my sanity still

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:28.370 
through this alive my sanity still
intact<00:04:25.580> as<00:04:26.580> far<00:04:26.789> as<00:04:26.880> I<00:04:27.000> know<00:04:27.169> there's<00:04:28.169> no

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
intact as far as I know there's no

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.830 
intact as far as I know there's no
actual<00:04:28.770> like<00:04:29.240> continued<00:04:30.240> system<00:04:30.630> in<00:04:30.750> this

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
actual like continued system in this

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.390 
actual like continued system in this
game<00:04:31.050> if<00:04:31.229> you<00:04:31.320> die<00:04:31.530> you<00:04:31.590> start<00:04:32.430> over<00:04:34.400> pretty

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.800 
but there's not much more to show off in
this<00:05:17.669> level<00:05:18.030> so<00:05:18.270> I'm<00:05:18.569> gonna<00:05:19.319> hand<00:05:19.560> it<00:05:19.680> over<00:05:20.810> get

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
this level so I'm gonna hand it over get

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:28.010 
this level so I'm gonna hand it over get
it<00:05:21.930> over<00:05:22.110> with<00:05:23.990> TV<00:05:26.300> you<00:05:27.300> do<00:05:27.419> get<00:05:27.570> bonuses<00:05:27.960> for
