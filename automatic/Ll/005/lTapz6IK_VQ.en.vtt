00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
for you guys first off the specs it is

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.769 
for you guys first off the specs it is
the<00:00:27.779> grey<00:00:28.140> iPhone<00:00:28.710> 5s<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.060> 16<00:00:30.420> gigabytes

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
the grey iPhone 5s it is 16 gigabytes

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.819 
the grey iPhone 5s it is 16 gigabytes
and<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.619> base<00:00:32.130> that<00:00:32.160> $200<00:00:33.120> off<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:34.110> any

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
and it is to base that $200 off of any

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.350 
and it is to base that $200 off of any
site<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.280> get<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.489> off<00:00:35.610> if<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.120> have<00:00:36.270> an

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
site that you get it off if you have an

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.700 
site that you get it off if you have an
upgrade<00:00:36.719> other<00:00:36.930> than<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.350> think<00:00:37.530> it's

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
upgrade other than that I think it's

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.069 
upgrade other than that I think it's
like<00:00:37.800> 600<00:00:38.309> anyway<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.450> box<00:00:39.690> itself

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.690 
at least now if you flip it over of
course<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.070> little<00:01:35.220> bit<00:01:35.369> different

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
course it is a little bit different

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.760 
course it is a little bit different
you'll<00:01:35.880> see<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.119> colors<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.509> little<00:01:36.570> bit

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
you'll see the colors a little bit

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.990 
you'll see the colors a little bit
definitely<00:01:37.770> different<00:01:37.979> tone<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.640> I'll<00:01:38.820> get

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
definitely different tone and I'll get

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.880 
definitely different tone and I'll get
more<00:01:39.180> into<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.479> later<00:01:39.540> as<00:01:40.380> well<00:01:40.470> as<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
more into that later as well as the

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.380 
more into that later as well as the
silver<00:01:41.310> on<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.520> sides<00:01:41.759> as<00:01:41.939> opposed<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
silver on the sides as opposed to the

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.090 
silver on the sides as opposed to the
darker<00:01:42.720> black<00:01:43.049> if<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.409> show<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.680> right<00:01:43.829> now

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
darker black if I show you right now

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.830 
darker black if I show you right now
actually<00:01:44.340> yeah<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.210> can<00:01:45.390> see<00:01:45.540> it's<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.659> lot

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
actually yeah you can see it's a lot

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.359 
actually yeah you can see it's a lot
darker<00:01:46.049> hence<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.799> difference<00:01:47.100> between

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
darker hence the difference between

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.050 
darker hence the difference between
black<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:47.970> silver<00:01:48.320> or<00:01:49.320> grey<00:01:49.740> sorry<00:01:50.070> but

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.410 
sides too it's not a darker black it's a
silver<00:02:58.410> tone<00:02:58.740> which<00:02:59.550> i<00:02:59.730> think<00:02:59.850> is<00:03:00.060> a<00:03:00.090> lot

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
silver tone which i think is a lot

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.300 
silver tone which i think is a lot
better<00:03:00.660> because<00:03:00.930> I<00:03:01.410> personally<00:03:01.950> didn't<00:03:02.280> like

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
better because I personally didn't like

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.920 
better because I personally didn't like
the<00:03:02.550> older<00:03:02.970> one<00:03:03.120> I<00:03:03.150> think<00:03:03.360> it<00:03:03.420> was<00:03:03.510> too<00:03:03.660> similar

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
the older one I think it was too similar

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.710 
the older one I think it was too similar
I<00:03:04.230> like<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:05.010> silver<00:03:05.310> gray<00:03:05.640> tone<00:03:06.090> because<00:03:06.570> it's

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
I like the silver gray tone because it's

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.360 
I like the silver gray tone because it's
a<00:03:06.750> really<00:03:06.930> nice<00:03:07.020> contrast<00:03:07.470> to<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.770> black<00:03:08.070> on

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
a really nice contrast to the black on

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.270
