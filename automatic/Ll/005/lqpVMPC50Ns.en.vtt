 You understand that it plays a very important role when you choose it . 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:34.630
 If you look at the colors of the orange base, 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:40.030
 Coral Pink Yoron Kids Orange 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:45.399
 Tomato Red What do you think of these orange- colored colors? 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:49.690
 Like hot pink, it is purple or pink . 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:50.530
 The feeling of the red garden is that the purple red is understood as the application red 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.000
 You can do it. 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:58.480
 There is a good difference in the Yoron tint now when I compare it with the one nose . 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.670

 Side yellow light turns camera luck or so Joe Brown we brown 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:36.520
 I think that the pale brown colors are somewhat of a body 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:38.590
 It's a little bit of a cool Jorinke Finckle Lavender light step on it. 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:44.320

 Rather than orange'm still so close to the side a little natural orange circle 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:03:01.520
 It looks a bit messy, and when it feels bigger and hot pink, it's rather natural 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:06.470
 You become brown and you become a point yesterday. 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:08.210
 So be a little toad way 9 minutes, but I'll also do pink L'yogeo

 There is a feeling that the lip that I want to give as a point inside is well mixed with the jint . 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:42.300
 So I wrote one so lovable bear, dry surfaces so once more additional mouth
