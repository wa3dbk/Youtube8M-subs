I say 1930s I don't know the exact date
serial<00:00:06.450> numbers<00:00:06.750> in<00:00:06.899> there<00:00:07.080> I<00:00:07.319> have<00:00:08.189> the

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
serial numbers in there I have the

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.200 
serial numbers in there I have the
resonator<00:00:09.450> on<00:00:09.570> so<00:00:09.840> I<00:00:09.900> can't<00:00:10.139> see<00:00:10.380> it<00:00:10.940> bacon<00:00:11.940> and

where<00:01:46.360> where<00:01:46.869> you'd<00:01:47.049> expect<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.970> resonator

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
where where you'd expect the resonator

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
anything just some surface panels but

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.800 
anything just some surface panels but
the<00:01:57.100> finger<00:01:57.700> board<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:58.060> one<00:01:58.179> thing<00:01:58.479> and<00:01:58.780> just

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
the finger board the one thing and just

the finger board the one thing and just
a<00:01:59.079> cosmetic<00:01:59.470> thing<00:01:59.740> that<00:01:59.860> the<00:02:00.009> fingerboard<00:02:00.490> is

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
a cosmetic thing that the fingerboard is

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:02.639 
a cosmetic thing that the fingerboard is
somebody<00:02:00.909> filled<00:02:01.570> in<00:02:01.780> some<00:02:02.049> spots<00:02:02.380> on<00:02:02.560> the

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
somebody filled in some spots on the

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.800 
somebody filled in some spots on the
fingerboard<00:02:02.979> around<00:02:04.799> 32nd<00:02:05.799> with<00:02:06.220> epoxy<00:02:06.810> looks

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
fingerboard around 32nd with epoxy looks

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.699 
fingerboard around 32nd with epoxy looks
a<00:02:07.929> little<00:02:08.049> funny<00:02:08.429> but<00:02:10.319> it's<00:02:11.319> only<00:02:11.470> cosmetic

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
a little funny but it's only cosmetic

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.070 
a little funny but it's only cosmetic
doesn't<00:02:12.370> affect<00:02:12.610> its<00:02:12.760> playability<00:02:13.239> I<00:02:13.690> guess

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
doesn't affect its playability I guess

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.040 
doesn't affect its playability I guess
it<00:02:14.260> was<00:02:14.560> really<00:02:14.830> nice
