00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
frequently make sure all the micro Jets

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.520 
frequently make sure all the micro Jets
are<00:01:31.979> okay<00:01:32.840> take<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.869> look<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.170> see<00:01:34.200> if<00:01:34.320> there's

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
are okay take a look to see if there's

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.109 
are okay take a look to see if there's
any<00:01:34.710> broken<00:01:34.950> wire<00:01:36.409> this<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.619> Kate<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:38.970> how

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
any broken wire this is Kate this is how

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.240 
any broken wire this is Kate this is how
that<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.829> branches<00:01:41.310> are<00:01:41.460> tied<00:01:41.729> down<00:01:43.250> it's

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
that the the branches are tied down it's

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
that the the branches are tied down it's
a<00:01:44.369> device<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:44.899> that<00:01:46.460> puts<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.610> tape<00:01:47.790> around

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
a device that that puts the tape around

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.120 
a device that that puts the tape around
and<00:01:48.600> then

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
and then

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.770 
and then
it<00:01:49.340> staples<00:01:50.149> it<00:01:50.270> on<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:50.540> other<00:01:50.689> side<00:01:52.689> this<00:01:53.689> is

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
it staples it on the other side this is

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.149 
it staples it on the other side this is
the<00:01:55.869> space<00:01:56.869> that<00:01:56.899> I<00:01:57.229> Drive<00:01:57.470> my<00:01:57.680> tractor

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
the space that I Drive my tractor

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.300 
the space that I Drive my tractor
through<00:01:58.460> four<00:01:58.789> four<00:01:59.509> harvests<00:01:59.750> so<00:02:00.229> I<00:02:00.470> usually

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
through four four harvests so I usually

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.969 
through four four harvests so I usually
go<00:02:01.490> through<00:02:01.700> a<00:02:01.759> few<00:02:02.000> times<00:02:02.299> and<00:02:02.679> I'm<00:02:03.679> trying<00:02:03.950> to

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
go through a few times and I'm trying to

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.740 
go through a few times and I'm trying to
make<00:02:04.189> sure<00:02:04.219> these<00:02:04.549> branches<00:02:05.119> are<00:02:05.270> up<00:02:05.420> on<00:02:05.600> the

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
make sure these branches are up on the

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.809 
make sure these branches are up on the
wire<00:02:05.960> so<00:02:05.990> I<00:02:06.470> can<00:02:06.530> get<00:02:06.860> the<00:02:06.979> tractor<00:02:09.489> we're<00:02:10.489> just

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
wire so I can get the tractor we're just

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.449 
wire so I can get the tractor we're just
at<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.269> at<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:11.989> blossom<00:02:12.530> stage<00:02:12.860> they<00:02:13.160> haven't

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
at the at the blossom stage they haven't

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:20.949 
at the at the blossom stage they haven't
opened<00:02:13.790> up<00:02:13.880> yet<00:02:17.319> it's<00:02:18.319> a<00:02:19.000> it's<00:02:20.000> a<00:02:20.450> white

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
opened up yet it's a it's a white

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.940 
opened up yet it's a it's a white
blossom<00:02:22.239> maybe<00:02:23.239> about<00:02:23.660> about<00:02:24.410> that<00:02:24.709> big

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
blossom maybe about about that big

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.240 
blossom maybe about about that big
around<00:02:25.099> and<00:02:25.849> it<00:02:26.420> hangs<00:02:26.630> down<00:02:26.870> so<00:02:27.440> it<00:02:27.530> faces<00:02:28.220> the

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
around and it hangs down so it faces the

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.539 
around and it hangs down so it faces the
ground<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.720> male<00:02:29.930> blossoms<00:02:30.650> are<00:02:30.920> are

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
ground and the male blossoms are are

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.520 
ground and the male blossoms are are
kind<00:02:32.269> of<00:02:32.360> a<00:02:32.420> cream-colored<00:02:32.750> there's<00:02:33.319> slightly

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
kind of a cream-colored there's slightly

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.490 
kind of a cream-colored there's slightly
different<00:02:33.950> color<00:02:34.690> so<00:02:35.690> there's<00:02:35.900> two<00:02:36.200> different

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
different color so there's two different

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.750 
different color so there's two different
colors<00:02:36.769> of<00:02:36.920> blossoms<00:02:39.130> not<00:02:40.130> too<00:02:40.310> many<00:02:40.489> small

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
colors of blossoms not too many small

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.120 
colors of blossoms not too many small
plantings<00:02:41.239> like<00:02:41.420> this<00:02:41.630> still<00:02:41.900> around<00:02:42.140> yeah<00:02:42.680> so

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
plantings like this still around yeah so

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.559 
plantings like this still around yeah so
how<00:02:43.340> do<00:02:43.400> you<00:02:43.519> make<00:02:43.670> a<00:02:43.700> go<00:02:44.180> of<00:02:44.209> it<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:45.910> it<00:02:46.910> helps

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
how do you make a go of it the it helps

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.680 
how do you make a go of it the it helps
to<00:02:47.690> be<00:02:47.810> organic<00:02:48.349> we<00:02:49.160> get<00:02:49.549> a<00:02:49.579> premium<00:02:50.060> over<00:02:50.480> the

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
to be organic we get a premium over the

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.390 
to be organic we get a premium over the
conventional<00:02:51.530> price<00:02:51.829> and<00:02:53.890> I've<00:02:54.890> never<00:02:55.130> lost

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
conventional price and I've never lost

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.220 
conventional price and I've never lost
money<00:02:55.700> what<00:02:56.209> is<00:02:56.329> it<00:02:56.480> that<00:02:57.079> actually

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
money what is it that actually

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.430 
money what is it that actually
distinguishes<00:02:58.100> organic<00:02:58.549> production<00:02:58.790> from

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
distinguishes organic production from

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.370 
distinguishes organic production from
other<00:03:00.440> types<00:03:00.799> the<00:03:01.900> conventional<00:03:02.900> Kiwi<00:03:03.380> grower

other types the conventional Kiwi grower

other types the conventional Kiwi grower
uses<00:03:06.380> pesticides<00:03:07.040> and<00:03:07.280> herbicides

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
uses pesticides and herbicides

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.900 
uses pesticides and herbicides
for<00:03:08.750> various<00:03:09.170> things<00:03:09.680> of<00:03:10.220> course<00:03:10.459> I<00:03:10.609> don't<00:03:10.790> do

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
for various things of course I don't do

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.770 
for various things of course I don't do
that<00:03:11.150> they're<00:03:11.450> also<00:03:11.660> using<00:03:12.400> synthetic

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
that they're also using synthetic

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.809 
that they're also using synthetic
nitrogen<00:03:14.780> fertilizers<00:03:15.579> and<00:03:17.319> that<00:03:18.639> that's<00:03:19.639> a

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
nitrogen fertilizers and that that's a

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:23.470 
nitrogen fertilizers and that that's a
big<00:03:20.030> difference<00:03:20.239> I<00:03:20.600> think<00:03:20.900> because<00:03:21.590> the<00:03:22.519> they

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
big difference I think because the they

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.839 
big difference I think because the they
tend<00:03:23.720> to<00:03:23.810> force<00:03:24.079> the<00:03:24.260> plants

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
tend to force the plants

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.770 
tend to force the plants
beyond<00:03:26.720> where<00:03:26.959> they<00:03:27.080> want<00:03:27.290> to<00:03:27.379> be<00:03:27.560> and<00:03:28.780> they're

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
beyond where they want to be and they're

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.729 
beyond where they want to be and they're
not<00:03:29.930> feeding<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.439> soil<00:03:30.849> so<00:03:31.849> that<00:03:33.640> it's<00:03:34.640> not<00:03:34.879> a

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
not feeding the soil so that it's not a

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.490 
not feeding the soil so that it's not a
complete<00:03:36.739> system<00:03:37.549> in<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:37.909> soil<00:03:38.209> that<00:03:38.750> they're

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
complete system in the soil that they're

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.199 
complete system in the soil that they're
just<00:03:39.709> putting<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:40.069> fertilizers<00:03:40.700> on<00:03:40.909> there

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
just putting the fertilizers on there

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.670 
just putting the fertilizers on there
and<00:03:41.299> the<00:03:41.390> plants<00:03:41.780> are<00:03:41.870> taking<00:03:42.049> them<00:03:42.349> up<00:03:42.530> and

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
and the plants are taking them up and

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.380 
and the plants are taking them up and
you<00:03:45.680> know<00:03:45.799> as<00:03:45.950> an<00:03:46.069> organic<00:03:46.370> producer<00:03:46.940> you're

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
you know as an organic producer you're

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.509 
you know as an organic producer you're
committed<00:03:47.810> to<00:03:47.930> this<00:03:48.049> concept<00:03:48.530> of<00:03:48.739> sort<00:03:49.370> of<00:03:49.400> a

committed to this concept of sort of a
systemic<00:03:49.849> approach<00:03:50.150> if<00:03:50.480> you<00:03:50.599> want<00:03:50.750> to<00:03:50.810> call<00:03:50.959> it

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
systemic approach if you want to call it

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.229 
systemic approach if you want to call it
that<00:03:51.140> to<00:03:51.530> building<00:03:52.250> the<00:03:52.340> soil<00:03:52.549> along<00:03:53.030> with

that to building the soil along with

that to building the soil along with

providing nutrition to the plant

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.520 
providing nutrition to the plant
I<00:03:54.890> believe<00:03:55.340> in<00:03:55.519> it<00:03:55.670> and<00:03:55.970> and<00:03:56.269> I<00:03:56.390> think<00:03:56.450> that<00:03:56.959> the

I believe in it and and I think that the

I believe in it and and I think that the

people who eat my Kiwis can notice the

people who eat my Kiwis can notice the
difference<00:04:01.480> there's<00:04:02.480> an<00:04:02.629> obvious<00:04:02.889> taste

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:03.889 
difference there's an obvious taste

difference there's an obvious taste
difference<00:04:04.780> between<00:04:05.780> organic<00:04:06.620> and
