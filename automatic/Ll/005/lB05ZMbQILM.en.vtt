 lime buds and so on all this 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.000
 gently drew on polishing after 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.449
 this is actually the process itself 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.400
 pasting 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.540

 we see that everything was there 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.290
 neatly even after that 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.090
 can the car 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.630
 everyday use ok then 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.010
 we start work and car 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.590
 preparatory ride at not 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.010
 ends now delete such 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.110
 pollution like a bat and poplar buds 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.840
 otherwise bumps will be visible under the film. 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:41.180
 special cleaning will be needed 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.180
 polishing clay and special mortar 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.300
 on this car will 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.509
 used film white matt but 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.420
 white from its unusual and with the effect of all 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.310
 roller that is when the light will fall 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.660
 on this film it will shine 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.330
 when the light will not fall on will 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.860
 just white matte film now you 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.320
 You may notice that the film in your 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.240
 the initial position that is to say she is 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.310
 us comes in a roll packed and 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.900
 in just 5 days you will see how 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.940
 this film will already be mounted on 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.430
 car checking lack 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.790
 pollution need to protect sq than 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.350
 neighboring details such a process is called 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.390
 masking is needed in order to 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.550
 not mounted when trimming excess 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.590
 film does not damage body parts 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.390
 the car 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.390
 each part of the machine is pasted separately 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.120
 clicked no but usually guided by 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.580
 the glue body joint has already been applied 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.000
 the film only needs to be measured and started 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.000
 work 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.650
 in order for the film to take shape 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:58.250
 need to warm it will become more 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.720
 elastic then we are even complicated 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.110
 curved surfaces we can not 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.110
 draw in 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.900
 temperature is about 350 degrees so 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.900
 pulling 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.810
 just a little bit on you 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:30.660
 with suitable mounting film 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:34.140
 me in hand squeegee tool which 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:39.690
 which we will make film mounting film 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:43.280
 glued to the dry surface of bubbles 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.280
 should not be 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.620
 hood pasted the easiest thing because it 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.840
 the smoothest part of the car and all that 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.100
 it remains to tuck the edges of the film and 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.530
 trim too much 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:04:00.020
 to do this, trim the edges with a scraper and 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.020
 hair dryer and of course help hands 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:15.079
 now we need the edges of the film 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:18.169
 tuck in the inside trim for 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:20.949
 this we all folds remove the case 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.949
 perfectly smooth 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.320
 material has memory if heated 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.460
 rumpled piece of film then he 'll be back in 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.920
 original form 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.590
 This property helps to glue smoothly . 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.260
 body bends making it easier to work 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.900
 we cut off excess film is very important here 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.690
 also pick the right tool this 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.130
 not some office knife 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.980
 plastic specially knives specially 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:56.170
 blades so that the car body does n't 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:58.780
 cut through when we work with 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.670
 By car, we do our full pasting 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.890
 masters thoroughly every centimeter 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:05.850
 body literally feel it 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:08.530
 do-it-yourself work 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:11.050
 car and pasting and suspension she 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:14.980
 similar to the work of a surgeon everything you need 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:17.730
 make beautifully smooth and importantly 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.730
 the first time 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.090
 the car is ready very soon we 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:33.520
 give it to the owner after the dogs 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.590

 looked all the corners of the turns to 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.830
 the film never left 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:50.200
 so beautiful and then you can 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:53.110
 use the car on the roads 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:57.430
 common use in our conditions 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:58.660

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.280
 often give the question how long the film will be 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:12.120
 On the machine, the film will be on 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.120

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:45.190
 against and still decided to cover the car 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.510
 film chose to blame Tomsk ru
