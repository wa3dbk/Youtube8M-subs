00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:16.510
 the episode to everyone who is also a 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:19.200
 hyper noise and here's the 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.200
 part 2 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.300
 I'll show you today I've already shown you 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.520
 cave that I showed as that because 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.800
 are all these places do not think the 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.510
 monster now the beach as this game goes 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.070
 have a lot to do alone and not 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:47.820
 Coliseum started to battle to win 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:49.980
 more places here and floral but if you play 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.739
 If you do not have a lot of patience in that 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.250
 business the 'battle' in training such I 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.530
 I think this game will not be so cool 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.330
 this is not because it has a battle 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.180
 extreme here otherwise you can not 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:06.570
 spend all the game because of the coliseum 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:13.670
 the xii I was trying to give a battle 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.670
 from the air but from what I saw it's fine you 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:20.360
 Are you seeing a video of a guy there? 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:25.030
 I think it was the guy who did it. 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:31.240
 an hour arrives in the coliseum that arrives 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.240
 until it took 2050 the pokémons of the carinhos 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:39.250
 femme dog to him by the tail that has 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:41.490
 a very strange heart rough around the 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.490
 world 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.350
 It's strange but the Pokémon appear 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:59.380
 It's out of the grammy take this taboo 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:02.080
 It was here in the bec is if you never had 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.310
 entered the beach before you come here that 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.560
 enter this place 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.979
 in that other portal you will go out there 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.130
 in the transport place but he will talk 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:17.739
 we found another portal you deserve 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:25.460
 a cream from there you win you win you 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:27.320
 earn a hard candy and rap ninja 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.920
 and she is very strong and if she has to 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.510
 accompanies and I will use my back because 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:38.660
 he is the weakest thing of all 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:41.500
 world here is rare that uses the lap 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.500
 so comfortable 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.040
 the cast 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.620
 the superport 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.840
 Elza does not know anything just to sell what 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.840
 it would be a mega hyper money more 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:03.370
 Who knows how to get there? 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.410
 place to follow a collision in that 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.620
 game does not happen if you hit a 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:12.820
 Coliseum I'll only be naked for the turn as 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:15.130
 There's absolutely nothing you can do. 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.920
 tava stay still get really annoying is 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.430
 You have to though I do not like chickens. 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.430
 I was also not like that but Coliseum 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.430
 on here 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:33.330
 hum this business that does not leave anything to 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.330
 speak 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:41.420
 a little to the north good note if to say 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.319
 a bit up 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.319
 is 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.860
 I'll show you something that's good. 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.970
 interesting for those who do not like 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.970
 be capturing Pokémon 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:00.859
 simply i was in the market pokémon 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.859
 comes from your leg 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.180
 Sorry again 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.810

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:16.569
 shopping and here at the pokémon mall 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.569
 so far it seems logical to me than normal 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.220
 I'll count pokémon 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:32.300
 and 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:42.050
 a person I know was having 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:42.050
 on the wall in there and I do not like it 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:06.389
 Hmm 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:06.389
 I love on another floor 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:46.550
 It's easy to show this even if you speak one 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:49.670
 little more about the game not because 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.860
 I want to think about my saying nothing and do not 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:55.990
 I can not even see where I'm going to teach you. 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.990
 downloading is very simple 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:19.840
 Hmm 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:20.979
 to demonstrate here but nothing to teach the 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.250
 download 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:27.280
 Okay, so I'm going to teach this in the 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:29.440
 next episode I'll also show you the 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:34.530
 normal game settings 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.530
 We're not going to leave the next episode. 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.260
 So you said that's all I'm saying. 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.820
