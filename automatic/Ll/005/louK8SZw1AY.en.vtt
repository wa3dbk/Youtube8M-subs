that<00:00:35.760> cup<00:00:36.059> there<00:00:36.440> and<00:00:37.440> then<00:00:37.590> this<00:00:37.800> creates<00:00:38.190> a

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
that cup there and then this creates a

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.850 
that cup there and then this creates a
stirrup<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.840> can<00:00:40.020> hold<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.410> uke<00:00:40.590> up

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.350 
let's say you want the uke up at this
angle<00:00:45.329> all<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.410> do<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:47.250> put<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.730> on<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.879> shorter

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
angle all you do is put it on a shorter

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.110 
angle all you do is put it on a shorter
hole<00:00:49.640> okay<00:00:50.640> roll<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.300> angle<00:00:51.870> back<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:53.120> put

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.700 
the cup on there and then the UQ see how
that<00:00:56.160> raises<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.910> angle<00:00:57.300> there<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:58.320> can<00:00:58.500> play

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
that raises the angle there you can play

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.310 
that raises the angle there you can play
it<00:00:58.770> on<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.070> left<00:00:59.280> leg<00:00:59.550> if<00:00:59.760> you<00:00:59.879> like<00:01:00.199> so<00:01:01.199> you've

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
it on the left leg if you like so you've

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.520 
it on the left leg if you like so you've
got<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.710> there

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
got that there

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.250 
got that there
and<00:01:03.740> it's<00:01:04.670> very<00:01:04.940> lightweight<00:01:05.210> and<00:01:05.480> folds<00:01:06.080> like

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
and it's very lightweight and folds like

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.290 
and it's very lightweight and folds like
this<00:01:06.560> so<00:01:06.770> if<00:01:06.890> you<00:01:06.980> have<00:01:07.100> a<00:01:07.130> bag<00:01:07.460> it<00:01:07.820> will<00:01:07.940> fit<00:01:08.120> in

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
this so if you have a bag it will fit in

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.480 
this so if you have a bag it will fit in
but<00:01:08.840> if<00:01:08.960> you<00:01:08.990> have<00:01:09.140> a<00:01:09.200> hard<00:01:09.500> case<00:01:09.800> you<00:01:10.070> just<00:01:10.280> pop

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
but if you have a hard case you just pop

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.670 
but if you have a hard case you just pop
it<00:01:10.520> off<00:01:10.790> like<00:01:11.090> that<00:01:11.300> so<00:01:11.900> that's<00:01:12.080> how<00:01:12.260> much<00:01:12.410> time

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
it off like that so that's how much time

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.610 
it off like that so that's how much time
it<00:01:12.860> takes<00:01:13.010> to<00:01:13.250> take<00:01:13.430> it<00:01:13.580> off<00:01:13.729> and<00:01:14.690> this<00:01:15.320> is<00:01:15.380> how

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
it takes to take it off and this is how

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.110 
it takes to take it off and this is how
much<00:01:15.800> time<00:01:16.010> it<00:01:16.070> takes<00:01:16.340> to<00:01:16.580> put<00:01:16.760> it<00:01:16.850> whoops

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
much time it takes to put it whoops

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.140 
much time it takes to put it whoops
wrong<00:01:17.600> hole<00:01:18.310> once<00:01:19.310> you<00:01:19.430> find<00:01:19.670> the<00:01:19.790> right<00:01:19.940> hole
