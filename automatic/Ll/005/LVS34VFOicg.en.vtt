00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.839
 high and extra circuit breaker test 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.060
 high voltage can present a set of 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.670
 of different challenges 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.650
 the long distance of the 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.050
 drive control relative to the 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.590
 main contacts requires more 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.590
 long 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.520
 depending on the voltage level the 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.770
 circuit breakers can have a common unit 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.719
 for all phases or may have the 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.230
 for opening and closing standalone 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.719
 depending on the application of the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.239
 technology joined the age of his 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.160
 design may have several switches 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.590
 inserts into a phase 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.899
 normally the micro-resistance and 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.539
 time measurements are taken in each 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.460
 switch requiring wiring 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.800
 for each of them 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.250
 this usually results in a heap 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.290
 long-term injection and measuring 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.450
 require a large amount of time 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.049
 to be configured and increases the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.180
 risk of test connection errors 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:14.100
 furthermore, since different 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.710
 equipment are used for the 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.080
 micro-resistance tests and time 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.570
 even the tangle of cables needs to be 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.290
 changed during long cable measurements 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.759
 and big turns also create problems 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.280
 electromagnetic and electrostatic 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.590
 Capacitive interferences are inductive 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.890
 which may disrupt the results of 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.890
 measurements 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.150
 the electric fields resulting from 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.520
 very energized surfaces 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.689
 requires the greatest increase of precaution with 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.259
 the security 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.960
 the combination of the Gypsy 500 and the modules 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.689
 contact form forms a solution 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.869
 simple and comprehensive insurance for these 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.869
 applications 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:59.909
 this allows all the tests in one 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.950
 circuit breaker are carried out with a 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.030
 test setup once 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.009
 configured 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.960
 these simple test connections and 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.149
 clear, they do not require any 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.270
 changes throughout all tests 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.580
 the contact module bmc 2 is the base 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.830
 measurement setup and allows you to 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.110
 perform the time measurements as well as 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.130
 static resistance measurements and 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.310
 dynamics 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.670
 the cbm c2 is positioned in front of the 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.670
 main contact of the day together it can 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.250
 measuring juniors with one or two 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:36.450
 switches since the module cbm c2 has 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.450
 two measuring channels 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.210
 the user connects an injection cable 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.310
 and a thin measuring cable in each 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.270
 side of the switch that needs to be 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.880
 analyzed 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.290
 this can conveniently be done with 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.810
 a clamp 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.320
 the injections and measurements are processed 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.970
 by the contact module and bmc 2 maintaining 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.800
 short hair and reducing 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:07.120
 possible interference to a 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:09.640
 minimum modes of contact and bmc two 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.470
 connected to the sipam through the 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.840
 a single cable that includes your 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.510
 power supply and its lines 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:21.790
 digital communication to control 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:24.190
 measurement results and reports a 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.200
 since only the digital values ​​are 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.600
 transmitted from the 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.850
 contact for the gypsy and vice versa the 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.530
 results along this path did not 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.040
 can be influenced by the 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.680
 external electromagnetic interference 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.410
 several cbm c2 modules can be 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.900
 connected to a gypsy, this allows 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.450
 three-phase circuit breakers with one or 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.790
 two switches per phase are 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.030
 verified in the execution of a test 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:55.270
 in this case a module is positioned in 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.940
 each phase of the together 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:01.750
 it first performs a measurement 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:04.810
 of static micro-resistance with 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.400
 same cabling these modules help to 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.610
 measure opening and closing times 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.310
 of the main switch contacts 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.620
 resistors and auxiliary contacts in the 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.380
 desired switching sequence 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.450
 revealing deviations in the nominal values and 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.109
 between the phases or between the 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.109
 money 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.650
 the coils of the opening coils and 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:39.910
 are also recorded by the 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:42.520
 sipam in the condition of the contacts of 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.530
 agreements can be evaluated 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.230
 by measuring the resistance 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.210
 dynamics of the switches indicating the 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.010
 changes in the resistance value 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.050
 during the opening and closing 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.240
 closing the opening tests and 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.280
 grant with a lock test 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.110
 minimum pick-up truck are 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.260
 determine the minimum level of attention 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:04.690
 for the opening command closing 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:07.000
 thanks to the source of this integrated variable 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:12.190
 the test shot with your 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.680
 This intention is perfectly practical for 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.370
 disruptors with more than 25 painters per 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.170
 phase 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.750
 such as those used in cameras 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:22.570
 Switches oil metering is 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:26.230
 performed phase by phase with each module 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:28.750
 analyzing two switches in this 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:31.780
 simple and clear measurement setup 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.870
 all measurements of time and resistance 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:37.540
 both static and dynamic can be 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:40.690
 done without changing the test connections 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.880
 and while you're grounded in 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:46.830
 both sides ensuring better 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.830
 safety conditions for the user 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:53.050
 the linear motion transducers 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:55.570
 can be connected in this way. 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.940
 with a main contact unit 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.390
 with only one connection from the 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.390
 cyberbullying 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:14.830
 the Gypsy 500 and its accessories provide 

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:18.190
 a comprehensive solution for a 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:21.390
 safe and flawless efficient factors in 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.390
 all voltage levels
