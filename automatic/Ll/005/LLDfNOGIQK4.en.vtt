and cutting a cross a cross shape into

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.230 
and cutting a cross a cross shape into
one<00:03:50.100> of<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.280> corners<00:03:50.700> not<00:03:51.540> tunnels<00:03:53.240> and

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
one of the corners not tunnels and

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.410 
one of the corners not tunnels and
squeezing<00:03:55.140> it<00:03:55.290> into<00:03:55.520> his<00:03:56.520> mouth<00:03:56.760> as<00:03:57.030> he<00:03:57.060> puts

squeezing it into his mouth as he puts

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.870 
squeezing it into his mouth as he puts
his<00:03:57.570> beak<00:03:57.780> inside<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.470> little<00:03:58.740> hole<00:03:58.890> and<00:03:59.220> it

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
his beak inside the little hole and it

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.320 
his beak inside the little hole and it
worked<00:04:00.060> really<00:04:00.150> well<00:04:00.450> he<00:04:01.200> did<00:04:01.410> great<00:04:02.180> he<00:04:03.180> or

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
worked really well he did great he or

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.390 
worked really well he did great he or
she<00:04:03.570> and<00:04:05.900> his<00:04:06.900> crop<00:04:07.140> is<00:04:07.380> nice<00:04:07.620> and<00:04:07.860> full<00:04:08.100> now<00:04:08.370> I

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
she and his crop is nice and full now I

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.100 
she and his crop is nice and full now I
think<00:04:08.820> I<00:04:09.090> think<00:04:09.840> it's<00:04:10.020> definitely<00:04:10.910> fuller

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
think I think it's definitely fuller

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.680 
think I think it's definitely fuller
than<00:04:13.110> it<00:04:13.290> was<00:04:13.500> I<00:04:14.000> guess<00:04:15.000> what<00:04:15.209> I<00:04:15.240> was<00:04:15.420> really

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
than it was I guess what I was really

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.449 
than it was I guess what I was really
worried<00:04:15.990> about<00:04:16.049> was<00:04:16.470> if<00:04:16.709> it<00:04:16.890> wasn't<00:04:17.250> empty

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
worried about was if it wasn't empty

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.490 
worried about was if it wasn't empty
because<00:04:18.450> they<00:04:18.660> say<00:04:18.870> that<00:04:19.049> if<00:04:19.170> it<00:04:19.290> doesn't

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
because they say that if it doesn't

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.199 
because they say that if it doesn't
empty<00:04:19.920> out<00:04:20.070> then<00:04:20.430> there's<00:04:20.790> something<00:04:21.030> wrong

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
empty out then there's something wrong

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.630 
empty out then there's something wrong
and<00:04:21.810> I<00:04:22.230> couldn't<00:04:22.530> tell<00:04:22.710> if<00:04:22.770> it<00:04:22.980> was<00:04:23.040> empty

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
and I couldn't tell if it was empty

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:30.320 
and I couldn't tell if it was empty
but<00:04:25.280> he<00:04:26.280> ate<00:04:26.570> very<00:04:27.570> eagerly<00:04:28.320> and<00:04:28.770> then<00:04:29.520> he

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
but he ate very eagerly and then he

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.409 
but he ate very eagerly and then he
stopped<00:04:30.750> like<00:04:31.530> he<00:04:32.160> seemed<00:04:32.460> to<00:04:32.940> say<00:04:33.150> that's

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
stopped like he seemed to say that's

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.870 
stopped like he seemed to say that's
enough<00:04:33.980> he<00:04:34.980> didn't<00:04:35.220> want<00:04:35.340> to<00:04:35.400> put<00:04:35.580> his<00:04:35.669> beak

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
enough he didn't want to put his beak

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.950 
enough he didn't want to put his beak
inside<00:04:36.330> anymore<00:04:38.060> and<00:04:39.060> he<00:04:39.360> started<00:04:39.720> doing<00:04:39.810> that

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
inside anymore and he started doing that

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.920 
inside anymore and he started doing that
little<00:04:40.320> motion<00:04:40.800> that<00:04:41.520> I<00:04:41.550> asked<00:04:42.120> earlier<00:04:42.210> if<00:04:42.720> it

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
little motion that I asked earlier if it

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.320 
little motion that I asked earlier if it
was<00:04:43.110> him<00:04:43.380> choking<00:04:43.770> so<00:04:44.700> I<00:04:44.730> don't<00:04:45.000> know<00:04:45.060> maybe

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
was him choking so I don't know maybe

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.240 
was him choking so I don't know maybe
that<00:04:45.480> means<00:04:45.690> he's<00:04:45.960> just<00:04:46.230> full<00:04:47.120> so<00:04:48.650> I<00:04:49.650> feel

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
that means he's just full so I feel

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.570 
that means he's just full so I feel
really<00:04:50.460> good<00:04:50.930> it's<00:04:51.930> almost<00:04:52.169> my<00:04:52.500> bedtime<00:04:54.140> so

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
shivering a little bit while I was

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.030 
shivering a little bit while I was
feeding<00:05:13.080> him<00:05:13.910> so<00:05:14.910> I<00:05:15.710> don't<00:05:16.710> know<00:05:16.770> if<00:05:16.890> he<00:05:17.010> just

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040

feeding him he didn't try to come over
and<00:05:26.040> eat<00:05:26.250> him<00:05:26.490> so<00:05:26.729> that's<00:05:26.820> a<00:05:27.030> good<00:05:27.180> sign<00:05:27.450> but

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810

I<00:05:34.860> don't<00:05:34.890> trust<00:05:35.190> tumbles<00:05:35.700> that<00:05:35.970> much<00:05:36.270> but

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
I don't trust tumbles that much but

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.469 
I don't trust tumbles that much but
aside<00:05:38.220> from<00:05:38.280> that<00:05:38.610> things<00:05:38.910> are<00:05:39.030> looking<00:05:39.060> good

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
aside from that things are looking good

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:42.969 
aside from that things are looking good
and<00:05:41.270> hopefully

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:45.199 
and hopefully
they'll<00:05:43.979> continue<00:05:44.159> to<00:05:44.489> go<00:05:44.669> well<00:05:44.879> hopefully

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:45.209 
they'll continue to go well hopefully

00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:47.089 
they'll continue to go well hopefully
the<00:05:45.479> bird<00:05:45.659> will<00:05:45.839> survive<00:05:46.169> even<00:05:46.649> though<00:05:46.799> I

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:47.099 
the bird will survive even though I

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:48.320 
the bird will survive even though I
don't<00:05:47.159> know<00:05:47.339> what<00:05:47.489> I'm<00:05:47.580> getting<00:05:47.759> myself<00:05:47.909> into

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
don't know what I'm getting myself into

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:55.819 
don't know what I'm getting myself into
I<00:05:48.839> never<00:05:49.019> wanted<00:05:49.499> a<00:05:49.619> bird<00:05:50.029> but<00:05:51.349> anyway<00:05:52.549> so<00:05:53.549> yeah
