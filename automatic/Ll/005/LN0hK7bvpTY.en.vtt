00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.360 

it<00:02:22.450> works<00:02:22.659> pretty<00:02:23.439> much<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.680> same<00:02:24.010> kind<00:02:24.340> of

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370

easy-to-use looking at the top you have

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:32.069 
easy-to-use looking at the top you have
a<00:02:29.700> full<00:02:30.700> cut<00:02:30.939> out<00:02:31.060> for<00:02:31.299> the<00:02:31.359> microphone<00:02:31.689> in<00:02:32.049> the

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.079 
a full cut out for the microphone in the

a full cut out for the microphone in the
headphone<00:02:32.469> jack<00:02:33.090> what<00:02:34.090> I<00:02:34.120> like<00:02:34.299> about<00:02:34.329> this

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
headphone jack what I like about this

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.959 
headphone jack what I like about this
cutout<00:02:35.049> is<00:02:35.349> that<00:02:35.680> you<00:02:36.189> are<00:02:36.340> more<00:02:36.640> than<00:02:36.909> likely

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:36.969 
cutout is that you are more than likely

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:38.610 
cutout is that you are more than likely
going<00:02:37.359> to<00:02:37.420> be<00:02:37.540> able<00:02:37.599> to<00:02:37.750> use<00:02:37.930> this<00:02:38.079> l-shape

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
going to be able to use this l-shape

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.890 
going to be able to use this l-shape
headphone<00:02:39.040> jacks<00:02:39.340> so<00:02:40.090> I<00:02:40.120> like<00:02:40.389> that<00:02:40.540> design

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
headphone jacks so I like that design

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.410 
headphone jacks so I like that design
materials<00:02:41.799> combine<00:02:41.980> with<00:02:42.310> a<00:02:42.340> TP<00:02:43.269> or

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
materials combine with a TP or

polycarbonate material that surrounds

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.259 
polycarbonate material that surrounds

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
the bumper you're going to get the

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.399 
the bumper you're going to get the
polycarbonate<00:02:49.959> on<00:02:50.139> the<00:02:50.349> top<00:02:51.310> edge<00:02:51.549> and<00:02:52.079> the<00:02:53.079> TP

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:53.409 
polycarbonate on the top edge and the TP

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:57.119 
polycarbonate on the top edge and the TP
material<00:02:53.950> it<00:02:54.010> is<00:02:54.129> here<00:02:54.430> on<00:02:54.609> the<00:02:54.659> side<00:02:56.040> one<00:02:57.040> of

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
material it is here on the side one of

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:58.409 
material it is here on the side one of
the<00:02:57.189> neat<00:02:57.370> things<00:02:57.400> about<00:02:57.730> this<00:02:57.939> case<00:02:58.150> is<00:02:58.209> that

00:02:58.409 --> 00:02:58.419 
the neat things about this case is that

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:00.899 
the neat things about this case is that
it<00:02:58.900> is<00:02:59.109> a<00:02:59.159> bumper<00:03:00.159> style<00:03:00.430> so<00:03:00.609> you<00:03:00.700> have<00:03:00.819> an

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:00.909 
it is a bumper style so you have an

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:03.179 
it is a bumper style so you have an
exposed<00:03:01.269> back<00:03:01.599> and<00:03:01.959> I<00:03:02.470> really<00:03:02.739> like<00:03:02.889> to<00:03:03.040> design

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:03.189 
exposed back and I really like to design

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:05.099 
exposed back and I really like to design
I<00:03:03.400> think<00:03:03.730> this<00:03:03.849> case<00:03:04.120> matches<00:03:04.569> well<00:03:04.750> with<00:03:04.780> the

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 
I think this case matches well with the

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.429 
I think this case matches well with the
why<00:03:05.349> galaxy<00:03:05.859> is<00:03:05.950> for<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:07.480> benefit<00:03:08.109> to<00:03:08.290> this

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:08.439 
why galaxy is for the benefit to this

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:10.409 
why galaxy is for the benefit to this
kind<00:03:08.680> of<00:03:08.709> case<00:03:08.859> two<00:03:09.129> is<00:03:09.280> that<00:03:09.459> it<00:03:09.730> is<00:03:09.969> raised

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:10.419 
kind of case two is that it is raised

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:14.039 
kind of case two is that it is raised
above<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:11.650> phone<00:03:11.980> and<00:03:12.700> above<00:03:12.939> the<00:03:12.969> screen<00:03:13.269> so

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
above the phone and above the screen so

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.699 
above the phone and above the screen so
if<00:03:14.169> you<00:03:14.260> want<00:03:14.409> to<00:03:14.469> put<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.680> phone<00:03:14.889> on<00:03:15.189> his<00:03:15.879> back

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
if you want to put the phone on his back

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.240 
if you want to put the phone on his back
or<00:03:17.709> on<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.930> screen<00:03:19.930> side<00:03:20.230> you<00:03:20.919> are<00:03:21.069> going<00:03:21.099> to

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
or on the screen side you are going to

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.860 
or on the screen side you are going to
be<00:03:21.310> protected<00:03:21.819> I<00:03:22.000> think<00:03:22.359> this<00:03:22.480> is<00:03:22.540> a<00:03:22.659> really

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870
