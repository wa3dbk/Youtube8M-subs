00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.949
 socially agree I keep telling 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.600
 also of missing so many hours for 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:49.070
 that we are in directivity, that is, 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.870

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.289
 you will be aware of everything 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.300
 related to the event when you go 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:57.980
 approaching the date the link and I guess that 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.370
 this will not be the only video in the milestones 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.250
 I warned maybe when the day of 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.170
 the issue next Tuesday for perhaps 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.460
 make another video already also 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.260
 advancing something else 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.110
 like the names of the other guests 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.150
 and also because already saying the time in 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.100
 different countries anyway the 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.450
 chat the time change to your area 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.270
 time because as you see me from so many 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.369
 countries, I really do not know what time it is 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.720
 which I must tell you the four of the 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.729
 Afternoon - Now New York 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.310
 make the converter of now your 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.560
 country and you will have the podcast schedule 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.229
 live, I told you that I do not know what 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.759
 you can lose you can imagine by 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.950
 where will the shots of the of the 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:40.940
 thematic of that episode but I think 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.759
 that is going to be a very good podcast with a 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.800
 great content but especially if it 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.450
 meet the forecasts of the guests 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.700
 that will bring Martian I think it's going to 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.399
 be a podcast where the 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.410
 crème de la crème no no for me but for 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.570
 them so I advise you not declare it 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.890
 you lose my little people so nothing for 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.050
 my part I do not have much more to say 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.670
