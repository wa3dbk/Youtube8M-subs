00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
onboard the camera itself I'm pretty

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.130 
onboard the camera itself I'm pretty
impressed<00:01:03.660> with<00:01:03.960> it's<00:01:04.619> got<00:01:04.770> a<00:01:04.800> nice<00:01:04.979> picture

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
impressed with it's got a nice picture

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.420 
impressed with it's got a nice picture
and<00:01:07.140> yeah<00:01:07.380> basically<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.740> just<00:01:07.890> kind<00:01:08.190> of<00:01:08.250> had

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
and yeah basically I just kind of had

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.340 
and yeah basically I just kind of had
heared<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.360> underside<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.080> top

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
heared it to the underside of the top

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.310 
heared it to the underside of the top
lane<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:11.270> then<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.420> hot-glued<00:01:12.660> the<00:01:12.990> camera

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
lane and then I hot-glued the camera

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.930 
lane and then I hot-glued the camera
straight<00:01:13.530> forward<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.040> was<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.190> little<00:01:14.399> angle

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
straight forward it was a little angle

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.020 
straight forward it was a little angle
down<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:15.990> get<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.290> may<00:01:16.440> feel<00:01:16.649> like<00:01:17.030> this

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
down so I get that may feel like this

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.460 
down so I get that may feel like this
does<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.300> bit<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.600> prop<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:18.990> front<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.320> but

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
does a bit of a prop in front of it but

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.010 
does a bit of a prop in front of it but
that's<00:01:19.649> okay<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.009> can<00:01:20.100> still<00:01:20.220> fly<00:01:20.780> and<00:01:21.780> then<00:01:21.899> I

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
that's okay you can still fly and then I

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.650 
that's okay you can still fly and then I
modify<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.740> battery<00:01:23.070> compartment<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.670> drop

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
modify the battery compartment to drop

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.210 
modify the battery compartment to drop
the<00:01:24.780> batteries<00:01:25.140> down<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.619> little<00:01:25.860> bit<00:01:26.009> lower

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
the batteries down a little bit lower

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.780 
the batteries down a little bit lower
and<00:01:26.340> further<00:01:26.640> back<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:29.310> other<00:01:29.430> thing<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.759> I

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
and further back the other thing is I

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.240 
and further back the other thing is I
put<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.240> transmitter<00:01:31.020> on<00:01:31.200> Channel<00:01:31.649> eight<00:01:31.830> and

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
put the transmitter on Channel eight and

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.680 
put the transmitter on Channel eight and
it<00:01:32.369> seems<00:01:32.580> to<00:01:32.640> have<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.820> best<00:01:32.910> range<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.600> the

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
it seems to have the best range and the

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:40.460 
it seems to have the best range and the
best<00:01:33.930> 30<00:01:38.390> so<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.630> little<00:01:39.810> one<00:01:39.990> cell<00:01:40.200> battery

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
best 30 so that little one cell battery

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.440 
best 30 so that little one cell battery
lasts<00:01:40.740> for<00:01:40.920> about<00:01:40.979> six-and-a-half<00:01:41.970> minutes

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
lasts for about six-and-a-half minutes

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.170 
lasts for about six-and-a-half minutes
and<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:43.260> UMX<00:01:43.740> hyperion<00:01:44.610> battery<00:01:44.940> in<00:01:45.030> there

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
and that UMX hyperion battery in there

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.120 
and that UMX hyperion battery in there
lasts<00:01:45.930> for<00:01:46.110> about<00:01:46.200> five<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.650> a<00:01:46.710> half<00:01:46.740> minutes

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
lasts for about five and a half minutes

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.630 
lasts for about five and a half minutes
so<00:01:47.310> it's<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.549> perfect<00:01:47.700> pairing<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:49.640> believe

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
so it's the perfect pairing I believe

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.899 
so it's the perfect pairing I believe
I'm<00:01:50.790> only<00:01:50.940> adding<00:01:51.210> 20<00:01:51.750> grams<00:01:52.580> overall<00:01:53.580> grant

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
I'm only adding 20 grams overall grant

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.300 
I'm only adding 20 grams overall grant
I'm<00:01:54.090> kidding<00:01:54.810> battery<00:01:55.140> for<00:01:55.770> our<00:01:55.860> friends<00:01:56.189> in
