00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.240
 Hello, you are welcome 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.790
 at a recipe today I'll show you 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.280
 my recipe for jack this is twenties 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:18.580
 in turkish style we need 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.890
 first 500 grams or more 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.240
 I'll earn yoghurt then 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.240
 to beat 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:38.850
 until 20 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:38.850
 garlic salt 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.160
 and cut half and small 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.300
 we are sharing a bit of olive oil 

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:02.440
 Now comes cucumbers 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.909
 either you can do it locally 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.039
 or cut small 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:08.970
 but I rather suffer that then small 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:08.970
 it tastes better too 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.439
 who wants to can this one more 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:59.319
 bit with water vettel but like us 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:02:01.599
 eat it that much so the fig becomes 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.630
 good eating in our area 

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:08.709
 will always be a small dish 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:11.290
 filled a bit for each one 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.959
 Olive oil over it will be very 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.940
 I hope it says you fun 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.220
 while watching and economic fun 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.060
 make it yourself and say goodbye 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.060
