00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:02.180 

alright<00:00:01.079> so<00:00:01.290> this<00:00:01.380> would<00:00:01.530> be<00:00:01.620> a<00:00:01.650> video<00:00:01.979> on

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
alright so this would be a video on

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.150 
alright so this would be a video on
finger<00:00:02.970> notation<00:00:03.540> and<00:00:03.689> how<00:00:04.380> I<00:00:04.410> twist<00:00:05.069> the

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
finger notation and how I twist the

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.379 
finger notation and how I twist the
layers<00:00:05.370> with<00:00:06.150> my<00:00:06.270> fingers<00:00:07.040> so<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.910> green<00:00:09.179> face

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
layers with my fingers so the green face

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.120 
layers with my fingers so the green face
will<00:00:09.570> be<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.690> front<00:00:10.019> and<00:00:10.200> red<00:00:10.740> will<00:00:10.920> be<00:00:11.010> the

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
will be the front and red will be the

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.390 
will be the front and red will be the
top<00:00:11.340> how<00:00:12.000> use<00:00:12.210> silicone<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:13.469> make<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.830> layers

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
top how use silicone to make the layers

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.279 
top how use silicone to make the layers
turn<00:00:14.759> with<00:00:14.940> ease<00:00:15.150> so<00:00:15.179> it's<00:00:15.570> easier<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:16.139> turn

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
turn with ease so it's easier to turn

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.790 
turn with ease so it's easier to turn
these<00:00:16.560> layers<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:17.670> for<00:00:18.240> you<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:18.720> use<00:00:19.470> my<00:00:19.619> right

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
these layers so for you I use my right

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.279 
these layers so for you I use my right
index<00:00:20.130> finger<00:00:20.670> just<00:00:21.449> easily<00:00:21.750> twisting<00:00:22.170> the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
index finger just easily twisting the

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.730 
index finger just easily twisting the
layer<00:00:22.439> like<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:23.660> you<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:24.869> using<00:00:25.380> my<00:00:25.500> left

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
layer like that you I is using my left

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.910 
layer like that you I is using my left
index<00:00:26.010> finger<00:00:26.390> simply<00:00:27.390> like<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:28.070> f<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:30.050> do<00:00:31.050> i

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
index finger simply like that f I do i

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.010 
index finger simply like that f I do i
do<00:00:32.669> f<00:00:32.940> with<00:00:33.210> my<00:00:33.390> right<00:00:33.750> index<00:00:34.020> finger<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:36.020> fi

do f with my right index finger and fi

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.889 
do f with my right index finger and fi
with<00:00:37.260> my<00:00:37.380> left<00:00:37.559> index<00:00:37.739> finger<00:00:38.629> sometimes<00:00:39.629> I'm

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
with my left index finger sometimes I'm

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.410 
with my left index finger sometimes I'm
in<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.140> middle<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.410> an<00:00:40.530> algorithm<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:41.420> may

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
in the middle of an algorithm I may

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.040 
in the middle of an algorithm I may
occasionally<00:00:42.809> use<00:00:43.290> my<00:00:43.500> thumb<00:00:44.100> or<00:00:44.969> my<00:00:45.930> other

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
occasionally use my thumb or my other

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.430 
occasionally use my thumb or my other
thumb<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:47.039> do<00:00:47.550> fi<00:00:47.969> or<00:00:48.950> F<00:00:50.120> but<00:00:51.120> that's<00:00:51.440> pretty

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
thumb to do fi or F but that's pretty

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.049 
thumb to do fi or F but that's pretty
uncommon<00:00:53.059> are<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.899> read<00:00:55.860> when<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.610> hold<00:00:56.940> it

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
uncommon are I read when you hold it

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.450 
uncommon are I read when you hold it
like<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.360> regrip<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.960> cube<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:58.379> my<00:00:58.559> right

finger which creates the M move that's

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.940 
finger which creates the M move that's
how<00:03:28.970> i<00:03:29.000> turn<00:03:29.780> my<00:03:29.810> layers<00:03:30.650> on<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.220> rubik's<00:03:31.609> cube
