pressed<00:04:35.220> powder<00:04:35.550> I<00:04:36.030> think<00:04:36.630> this<00:04:36.810> one<00:04:37.050> I<00:04:37.080> really

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
pressed powder I think this one I really

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.190 
pressed powder I think this one I really
recommend<00:04:38.070> this<00:04:38.130> but<00:04:38.430> it<00:04:38.970> has<00:04:39.300> this<00:04:39.630> satin

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
recommend this but it has this satin

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.030 
recommend this but it has this satin
texture<00:04:40.800> and<00:04:41.130> it<00:04:42.120> this<00:04:42.540> really<00:04:42.840> feels<00:04:43.230> like<00:04:43.500> a

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
texture and it this really feels like a

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.750 
texture and it this really feels like a
branded<00:04:44.700> pressed<00:04:45.390> powder<00:04:46.220> just<00:04:47.220> like<00:04:47.460> my

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
branded pressed powder just like my

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.440 
branded pressed powder just like my
nurse<00:04:48.710> it's<00:04:49.710> not<00:04:50.040> that<00:04:50.370> too<00:04:50.610> powdery<00:04:50.880> like

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
nurse it's not that too powdery like

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.860 
nurse it's not that too powdery like
when<00:04:51.690> you<00:04:51.780> put<00:04:52.050> your<00:04:52.080> brush<00:04:52.560> on<00:04:53.070> it<00:04:53.130> like<00:04:53.940> the

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
when you put your brush on it like the

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.760 
when you put your brush on it like the
powder<00:04:55.080> goes<00:04:55.650> everywhere<00:04:56.750> so<00:04:57.750> I<00:04:57.780> think<00:04:57.990> and

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
powder goes everywhere so I think and

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.830 
powder goes everywhere so I think and
the<00:04:59.130> reason<00:04:59.460> why<00:04:59.640> I<00:04:59.669> got<00:05:00.000> this<00:05:00.210> because<00:05:00.479> I

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
the reason why I got this because I

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.290 
the reason why I got this because I
really<00:05:01.140> need<00:05:01.350> a<00:05:01.650> new<00:05:02.010> pressed<00:05:02.430> powder<00:05:02.760> because

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.560 
I almost ran out so I think this one is
a<00:05:07.020> perfect<00:05:07.350> replacement<00:05:08.040> for<00:05:08.910> my<00:05:09.120> pressed
