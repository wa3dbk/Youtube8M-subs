July 11th 2015 at the age of 55 it was
depressing<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.440> it<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.710> very<00:00:14.130> sad<00:00:14.519> loss<00:00:14.820> for

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
mine asked what games was owada directly

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.070 
mine asked what games was owada directly
involved<00:00:20.760> with<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.180> if<00:00:21.420> he<00:00:21.600> did<00:00:21.810> anything

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.570 
involved with and if he did anything
major<00:00:22.529> for<00:00:23.010> Pokemon

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
major for Pokemon

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.040 
major for Pokemon
so<00:00:23.760> in<00:00:23.910> today's<00:00:24.029> theory<00:00:24.600> we<00:00:24.810> will<00:00:24.930> be

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
so in today's theory we will be

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.509 
so in today's theory we will be
discussing<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.740> man<00:00:25.980> who<00:00:26.189> single-handedly

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
discussing a man who single-handedly

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.450 
discussing a man who single-handedly
made<00:00:27.390> pokemon<00:00:28.019> gold<00:00:28.349> silver<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.039> crystal

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
made pokemon gold silver and crystal

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:39.930 
made pokemon gold silver and crystal
possible

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.360 

so<00:00:40.940> the<00:00:41.090> theory<00:00:41.480> is<00:00:41.630> water<00:00:42.260> was<00:00:42.590> involved<00:00:43.190> with

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
so the theory is water was involved with

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.180 
so the theory is water was involved with
many<00:00:43.670> games<00:00:43.940> but<00:00:44.390> did<00:00:44.990> he<00:00:45.110> actually<00:00:45.350> program

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
many games but did he actually program

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.340 
many games but did he actually program
or<00:00:46.400> make<00:00:46.580> any<00:00:46.820> big<00:00:47.120> changes<00:00:47.660> to<00:00:47.870> the<00:00:47.960> Pokemon

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
or make any big changes to the Pokemon

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.560 
or make any big changes to the Pokemon
games<00:00:48.380> and<00:00:48.830> that<00:00:49.160> is<00:00:49.340> a<00:00:49.370> good<00:00:49.610> question<00:00:49.880> until

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
games and that is a good question until

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.260 
games and that is a good question until
