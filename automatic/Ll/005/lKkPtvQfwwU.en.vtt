00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.800
 hello friends put in greeting them 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:08.920
 again 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:12.660
 in this part we are going to see 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.660
 how to prepare a painting 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:20.470
 it is not enamel 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:23.860
 it is being color base 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.700
 the painting that is for pica for 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.250
 This painting has no shine 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.960
 let's go to a painting we 're always going to 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.260
 move the ones that are fixed let's move 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.260
 this 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.060
 so that all the metals that have been 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.590
 seated go up 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:47.240
 and no I'm not the tone out 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.240
 then let's move it 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:55.120
 this is a 1 liter pot 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.120
 I'm going to prepare what is a little room 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.130
 apart 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.130
 let's throw him 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.789
 the closing of a room in a room of 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.789
 point 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:37.230
 what are the characteristics 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.230
 which we are going to 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:50.540
 let's take a look with this reducer 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.870
 It is very important that you know 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.650
 that this reducer serves so that 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.650
 change the tones 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.710
 because if we remove normal thinner from 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.950
 standard 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.960
 it's going to burn the metals 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.320
 then it is very important to put the 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.479
 reducer 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.330
 how much are we going to put the reducer if 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.250
 they fixed 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:18.990
 or if they are fixed they realize 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.670
 this is a tone a good red tone is 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.920
 a red tone 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.360
 it is a tone that covers it 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.360
 does not cover much 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.480
 then what are we going to do this painting 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.450
 is reduced to one hundred percent 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.020
 If I have a room, I will make a 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.740
 reducer room 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.470
 but as these colors do not cover we're going 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.880
 to throw him like 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.580
 80 to 70% 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.960
 what we are going to do we are going to throw his 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.580
 redoubt 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.110
 over here 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.600
 orchestral redoubts 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.190
 100% is how until here we are going to 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.190
 throw him here the reducer 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.190
 so 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.280
 move him 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.530
 and we are going to make the consistency of the 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:26.159
 painting now we are going to realize 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.159
 how much capacity can we dilute 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:41.560
 how 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:44.160
 let's do them I'll give you a tip let's go 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.160
 to put the shovel 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.370
 it is fixed is not so transparent 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:04:02.560
 is an option to be able to paint 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:07.260
 this these tones well works because they are 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.260
 tones that do not cover much 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.220
 when we have a part of paint 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.170
 we can do the other part 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.420
 of reducer but when they are colors 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.519
 black gray silver 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.190
 the banana much the same paper as the 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.350
 red does not cover much but what are the 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.240
 the plain colors 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.240
 if we can dilute the hundred 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:33.110
 cent but these not because they do not have 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.630
 many many coatings 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.330
 so then that's what we're going to 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.030
 do in the paintings 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.890
 and that's how you work 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.500
 there are other paintings that are worked on 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:48.230
 only different way 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.810
 you have to read the instructions because 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:53.300
 are the brands depends on the brand 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.780
 they are also the diluents and 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.720
 also its being reducers 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:02.160
 then I hope you have served friends and 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.160
 Well, see you next time
