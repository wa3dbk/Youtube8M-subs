express individuality at school school
actually<00:02:15.210> no<00:02:15.300> I<00:02:15.330> don't<00:02:15.510> really<00:02:15.720> mind<00:02:15.990> that<00:02:16.200> at

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
actually no I don't really mind that at

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.530 
actually no I don't really mind that at
all<00:02:16.410> uh<00:02:16.590> but<00:02:17.490> you<00:02:17.760> know<00:02:17.790> bounds<00:02:18.210> of<00:02:18.270> reason

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
all uh but you know bounds of reason

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.190 
all uh but you know bounds of reason
like<00:02:18.690> you<00:02:18.720> can't

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
like you can't

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.750 
like you can't
the<00:02:19.500> dress<00:02:19.740> code<00:02:19.920> if<00:02:20.100> you<00:02:20.190> have<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.310> religion

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
the dress code if you have a religion

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.100 
the dress code if you have a religion
that's<00:02:20.940> it<00:02:21.270> says<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.570> gotta<00:02:21.690> wear<00:02:21.840> white

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
that's it says you gotta wear white

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.320 
that's it says you gotta wear white
power<00:02:22.350> shirt<00:02:22.710> now<00:02:23.220> you<00:02:23.580> can't<00:02:23.850> and<00:02:24.060> we<00:02:24.180> can

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
power shirt now you can't and we can

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.000 
power shirt now you can't and we can
restrict<00:02:24.570> that<00:02:24.810> but<00:02:25.350> this<00:02:25.590> is<00:02:25.770> pretty

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
restrict that but this is pretty

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.490 
restrict that but this is pretty
reasonable<00:02:26.190> uh<00:02:26.700> he's<00:02:27.240> tying<00:02:27.480> his<00:02:27.660> hair<00:02:27.810> up<00:02:27.930> yet

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
reasonable uh he's tying his hair up yet

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.710 
reasonable uh he's tying his hair up yet
so<00:02:28.530> let<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.160> ride<00:02:29.310> up<00:02:29.520> it's<00:02:29.730> beyond<00:02:30.150> reasonable

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
so let it ride up it's beyond reasonable

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.410 
so let it ride up it's beyond reasonable
and<00:02:31.110> also<00:02:31.560> I<00:02:31.890> think<00:02:32.490> administrators

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
and also I think administrators

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.820 
and also I think administrators
especially<00:02:34.080> when<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.290> comes<00:02:34.380> to<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.620> dress

they<00:02:40.020> have<00:02:40.260> dress<00:02:40.560> codes<00:02:40.590> because<00:02:41.280> they<00:02:41.400> want

they have dress codes because they want

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.280 
they have dress codes because they want
