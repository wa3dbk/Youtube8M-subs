unfortunately but what you do get is the

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.400 
unfortunately but what you do get is the
new<00:00:26.990> 25<00:00:27.800> dark<00:00:28.250> drum<00:00:28.850> and<00:00:29.150> the<00:00:30.080> cool<00:00:30.230> thing

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
new 25 dark drum and the cool thing

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.560 
new 25 dark drum and the cool thing
about<00:00:30.439> this<00:00:30.769> versus<00:00:31.250> the<00:00:31.369> 18<00:00:31.760> drum<00:00:31.970> and<00:00:32.090> the<00:00:32.150> 35

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
about this versus the 18 drum and the 35

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.330 
about this versus the 18 drum and the 35
drum<00:00:32.840> that<00:00:32.989> you<00:00:33.050> could<00:00:33.170> already<00:00:33.500> get<00:00:33.650> is<00:00:34.129> it

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
drum that you could already get is it

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.799 
drum that you could already get is it
comes<00:00:34.519> out<00:00:34.670> of<00:00:34.790> the<00:00:34.850> center<00:00:35.059> instead<00:00:35.600> of<00:00:35.719> out

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
comes out of the center instead of out

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:37.180 
comes out of the center instead of out
of<00:00:35.930> the<00:00:36.020> side<00:00:36.200> so<00:00:36.559> I'd<00:00:36.649> probably<00:00:36.800> be<00:00:37.040> more

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
of the side so I'd probably be more

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.380 
of the side so I'd probably be more
comfortable<00:00:37.340> if<00:00:37.700> you<00:00:37.790> were<00:00:37.880> putting<00:00:38.090> it<00:00:38.180> in

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
comfortable if you were putting it in

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.750 
comfortable if you were putting it in
like<00:00:38.570> a<00:00:38.600> raven<00:00:39.050> or<00:00:39.260> in<00:00:40.010> the<00:00:40.100> new<00:00:40.190> retaliate<00:00:40.730> or

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
like a raven or in the new retaliate or

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.209 
like a raven or in the new retaliate or
recon<00:00:41.180> or<00:00:41.360> something<00:00:41.600> that's<00:00:41.719> got<00:00:41.930> a<00:00:42.219> alpha

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
recon or something that's got a alpha

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:44.920 
recon or something that's got a alpha
troop<00:00:43.370> or<00:00:43.489> even<00:00:43.760> something<00:00:44.360> that's<00:00:44.570> got<00:00:44.750> the

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
troop or even something that's got the

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.350 
troop or even something that's got the
magazine<00:00:45.920> well<00:00:46.100> in<00:00:46.370> the<00:00:46.460> middle<00:00:46.700> instead<00:00:46.969> of

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
magazine well in the middle instead of

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.180 
magazine well in the middle instead of
on<00:00:47.600> the<00:00:47.719> side<00:00:47.899> so<00:00:48.739> that<00:00:48.860> would<00:00:48.950> be<00:00:49.039> more

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
on the side so that would be more

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.190 
on the side so that would be more
comfortable<00:00:49.399> to<00:00:49.700> hold<00:00:49.820> and<00:00:50.030> 25<00:00:50.660> darts<00:00:50.930> is<00:00:51.020> good

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 
comfortable to hold and 25 darts is good

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.250 
comfortable to hold and 25 darts is good
number<00:00:51.500> but<00:00:52.489> so<00:00:52.820> what<00:00:53.059> we're<00:00:53.180> gonna<00:00:53.270> do<00:00:53.510> is<00:00:53.690> as

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
number but so what we're gonna do is as

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.470 
number but so what we're gonna do is as
we<00:00:54.410> did<00:00:54.559> with<00:00:54.680> the<00:00:54.739> Raider<00:00:54.949> because<00:00:55.699> it<00:00:55.850> the

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
we did with the Raider because it the

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.080 
we did with the Raider because it the

elite darts the Rangers seem to be
pretty<00:02:32.880> comparable<00:02:33.270> as<00:02:33.600> you<00:02:33.810> can<00:02:33.959> see<00:02:34.140> the

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
pretty comparable as you can see the

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.930 
pretty comparable as you can see the
groupings<00:02:34.950> are<00:02:35.070> kind<00:02:35.310> of<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.459> same<00:02:35.640> but<00:02:35.790> you

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
groupings are kind of the same but you

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.850 
groupings are kind of the same but you
notice<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.330> elite<00:02:36.510> darts<00:02:36.690> go<00:02:36.900> much

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
notice the elite darts go much

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.740 
notice the elite darts go much
straighter<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.520> more<00:02:38.610> consistently<00:02:39.390> than

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
straighter and more consistently than

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.120 
straighter and more consistently than
the<00:02:39.840> regular<00:02:40.110> streamlines<00:02:40.560> that<00:02:40.770> float<00:02:41.010> all

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
the regular streamlines that float all

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.400 
the regular streamlines that float all
over<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.430> place<00:02:41.580> now<00:02:42.510> we're<00:02:42.690> at<00:02:42.870> our<00:02:43.020> lowest

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
over the place now we're at our lowest

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.920 
over the place now we're at our lowest
streamline<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.750> that<00:02:45.750> is<00:02:45.900> at<00:02:46.080> 27<00:02:46.830> feet<00:02:47.930> work

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930

stream line all right here and that's

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.680 
stream line all right here and that's
about<00:05:04.970> smack-dab<00:05:05.780> between<00:05:06.710> 45<00:05:07.190> and<00:05:07.220> 46<00:05:07.789> so<00:05:08.150> 45

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.050 
about smack-dab between 45 and 46 so 45
46<00:05:09.110> range<00:05:09.440> I<00:05:09.650> guess<00:05:09.800> the<00:05:10.460> highest<00:05:10.669> stream<00:05:10.880> line

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
46 range I guess the highest stream line

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.430 
46 range I guess the highest stream line
is<00:05:11.349> we<00:05:12.349> work<00:05:12.440> over<00:05:12.680> up<00:05:12.919> there<00:05:13.220> we<00:05:13.729> go<00:05:14.139> blue<00:05:15.139> on

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
is we work over up there we go blue on

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.120 
is we work over up there we go blue on
the<00:05:15.590> grass<00:05:15.889> that's<00:05:16.729> the<00:05:16.880> highest<00:05:17.030> elite<00:05:17.479> dart

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
that is coming in at just shy well kind

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.159 
that is coming in at just shy well kind
of<00:05:23.660> in<00:05:23.990> the<00:05:24.110> middle<00:05:24.349> of<00:05:24.500> 49<00:05:25.250> and<00:05:25.280> 50<00:05:25.880> so<00:05:26.810> we'll

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169 
of in the middle of 49 and 50 so we'll

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:31.120 
of in the middle of 49 and 50 so we'll
call<00:05:27.320> that<00:05:27.349> 49<00:05:27.889> to<00:05:28.010> 50<00:05:28.310> feet<00:05:28.720> for<00:05:29.720> the<00:05:30.130> rampage
