00:01:12.559 --> 00:01:12.569 
freshman year of college I was still

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:15.770 
freshman year of college I was still
wearing<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.020> contact<00:01:13.530> lens<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.039> I<00:01:14.670> was<00:01:15.030> very

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
wearing the contact lens and I was very

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.050 
wearing the contact lens and I was very
concerned<00:01:16.079> about<00:01:16.289> my<00:01:16.530> appearance<00:01:16.829> not<00:01:17.789> only

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
concerned about my appearance not only

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.910

because<00:01:18.359> I<00:01:18.509> my<00:01:18.929> eyes<00:01:19.170> didn't<00:01:19.590> look<00:01:19.709> the<00:01:19.889> same

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
because I my eyes didn't look the same

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.669 
because I my eyes didn't look the same
but<00:01:20.369> also<00:01:20.579> because<00:01:21.029> it<00:01:21.329> was<00:01:21.679> not

00:01:22.669 --> 00:01:22.679 
but also because it was not

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:24.289 
but also because it was not
cost-effective<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.520> keep<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.969> know<00:01:24.060> wearing

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
cost-effective to keep you know wearing

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.239 
cost-effective to keep you know wearing
the<00:01:24.450> contact<00:01:24.840> lens<00:01:25.049> when<00:01:25.529> I<00:01:25.560> first<00:01:25.889> came<00:01:26.069> into

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:26.249 
the contact lens when I first came into

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:28.519 
the contact lens when I first came into
the<00:01:26.399> office<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.909> had<00:01:26.969> many<00:01:27.539> misconceptions<00:01:27.899> as

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
many people probably do I thought the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.620 
many people probably do I thought the
prosthetic<00:01:31.979> eyes<00:01:32.130> were<00:01:32.429> round<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.299> they<00:01:33.539> were

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
prosthetic eyes were round and they were

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.809

just<00:01:33.779> go<00:01:33.899> into<00:01:34.020> her<00:01:34.259> eye<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.920> also<00:01:35.369> thought<00:01:35.609> they

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819 
just go into her eye I also thought they

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:39.199 
just go into her eye I also thought they
were<00:01:35.939> made<00:01:36.270> out<00:01:36.389> of<00:01:36.509> glass<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:37.969> also<00:01:38.969> thought
