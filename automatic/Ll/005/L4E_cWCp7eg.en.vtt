00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
about 12 minutes and at the end of it

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.479 
about 12 minutes and at the end of it
you're<00:00:31.439> going<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.650> see<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:32.040> got<00:00:32.219> over<00:00:32.460> like

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
you're going to see that I got over like

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.069 
you're going to see that I got over like
300<00:00:35.489> or<00:00:35.640> something<00:00:36.000> rune<00:00:36.300> cloth<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.719> think<00:00:36.930> I

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
300 or something rune cloth I think I

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.709 
300 or something rune cloth I think I
think<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.800> was<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.370> number<00:00:38.640> like<00:00:38.850> 250<00:00:39.600> or

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
think that was the number like 250 or

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.479 
think that was the number like 250 or
something<00:00:39.989> like<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:41.129> basically

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
something like that and so basically

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.030 
something like that and so basically
what<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.120> do<00:00:42.270> here<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.620> there's<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.710> trick<00:00:44.010> to

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
what you do here is there's a trick to

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.130 
what you do here is there's a trick to
this<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:45.329> can<00:00:45.480> only<00:00:45.629> do<00:00:45.809> this<00:00:45.930> with

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
this and you can only do this with

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.680 
this and you can only do this with
certain<00:00:46.440> classes<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.940> idea<00:00:48.270> here<00:00:48.539> is

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
certain classes and the idea here is

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.119 
certain classes and the idea here is
that<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.960> have<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.200> go<00:00:49.289> invisible<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:49.890> drop

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
that you have to go invisible and drop

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.970 
that you have to go invisible and drop
combat<00:00:50.610> as<00:00:50.789> soon<00:00:51.570> as<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.809> drop<00:00:52.050> combat<00:00:52.590> all<00:00:52.920> of

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
combat as soon as you drop combat all of

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.490 
combat as soon as you drop combat all of
the<00:00:53.460> mobs<00:00:53.699> respond<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.840> only<00:00:55.079> thing<00:00:55.289> that's

the mobs respond the only thing that's
different<00:00:55.590> after<00:00:56.219> they<00:00:56.370> respond<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
different after they respond is the

if you're on one of those servers I mean

if you're on one of those servers I mean
this<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.450> definitely<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.869> really<00:01:55.140> good<00:01:55.320> thing

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
this is definitely a really good thing

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.039 
this is definitely a really good thing
to<00:01:55.530> do<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.979> have<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.939> be<00:01:57.060> able<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.360> drop<00:01:57.540> combat

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
to do you have to be able to drop combat

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.630 
to do you have to be able to drop combat
if<00:01:58.259> you're<00:01:58.770> not<00:01:58.950> able<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.250> drop<00:01:59.490> combat<00:02:00.350> these

if you're not able to drop combat these

if you're not able to drop combat these
spell<00:02:02.719> Spellbinders<00:02:03.719> will<00:02:04.020> never<00:02:04.290> will<00:02:05.219> never

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
spell Spellbinders will never will never

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.340 
spell Spellbinders will never will never
get<00:02:05.700> off<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.299> if<00:02:06.420> they<00:02:06.719> don't<00:02:06.840> be<00:02:07.049> set

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
get off you and if they don't be set

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.790 
get off you and if they don't be set
then<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.710> mobs<00:02:07.890> don't<00:02:08.129> they<00:02:08.640> don't<00:02:08.700> respawn

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
then the mobs don't they don't respawn

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.199 
then the mobs don't they don't respawn
this<00:02:10.800> but<00:02:11.069> why<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.340> Spellbinders<00:02:12.030> aren't

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
this but why the Spellbinders aren't

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.640 
this but why the Spellbinders aren't
dying<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.660> that<00:02:12.900> they're<00:02:13.050> actually

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
dying is that they're actually

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.410 
dying is that they're actually
completely<00:02:13.860> immune<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.430> all<00:02:14.640> magic<00:02:15.209> damage

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
completely immune to all magic damage

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.050 
completely immune to all magic damage
and<00:02:15.840> so<00:02:16.439> any<00:02:16.680> magic<00:02:17.129> damaging<00:02:17.549> deals<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.909> them

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
and so any magic damaging deals of them

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.539 
and so any magic damaging deals of them
is<00:02:18.450> completely<00:02:18.930> ineffective<00:02:19.349> and<00:02:19.739> so<00:02:20.250> this

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
is completely ineffective and so this

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.759 
is completely ineffective and so this
means<00:02:20.760> it's<00:02:21.150> extremely<00:02:21.750> easy<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.019> do<00:02:22.230> this<00:02:22.409> as

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
means it's extremely easy to do this as

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.729 
means it's extremely easy to do this as
a<00:02:22.829> as<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.700> mage<00:02:24.450> especially<00:02:25.110> with<00:02:25.260> our<00:02:25.470> greater

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
a as a mage especially with our greater

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.339 
a as a mage especially with our greater
invisibility<00:02:26.340> like<00:02:27.060> this<00:02:27.239> is<00:02:27.420> like<00:02:27.629> a<00:02:27.689> mage<00:02:28.019> is

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
invisibility like this is like a mage is

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.770 
invisibility like this is like a mage is
the<00:02:28.590> optimal<00:02:29.159> class<00:02:29.459> to<00:02:29.760> do<00:02:29.879> this<00:02:30.030> on<00:02:30.209> because

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
the optimal class to do this on because

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.960 
the optimal class to do this on because
it<00:02:31.200> runs<00:02:31.379> they're<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.370> clears<00:02:32.640> take

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
it runs they're the the clears take

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.849 
it runs they're the the clears take
about<00:02:33.239> one<00:02:33.599> and<00:02:33.689> a<00:02:33.780> half<00:02:33.810> minutes<00:02:34.349> and<00:02:34.650> that's

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
about one and a half minutes and that's

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.160 
about one and a half minutes and that's
the<00:02:34.950> cool<00:02:35.159> down<00:02:35.340> namond<00:02:35.489> is<00:02:35.819> and<00:02:36.120> so<00:02:36.870> i<00:02:36.900> mean

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
the cool down namond is and so i mean

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.259 
the cool down namond is and so i mean
this<00:02:37.260> is<00:02:37.439> just<00:02:37.470> extremely<00:02:38.280> extremely

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
this is just extremely extremely

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.229 
this is just extremely extremely
efficient<00:02:39.930> if<00:02:40.079> you're<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.260> mage<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:40.829> i<00:02:41.239> went

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
efficient if you're a mage and i went

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.149 
efficient if you're a mage and i went
back<00:02:42.299> and<00:02:42.659> i<00:02:42.930> will<00:02:43.079> tell<00:02:43.409> you<00:02:43.560> guys<00:02:43.620> this<00:02:43.980> now

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
back and i will tell you guys this now

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:46.430 
back and i will tell you guys this now
before<00:02:44.370> I<00:02:44.549> forget<00:02:44.730> is<00:02:45.120> I<00:02:45.659> went<00:02:45.870> back<00:02:46.049> later<00:02:46.079> on

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
before I forget is I went back later on

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.800 
before I forget is I went back later on
and<00:02:46.889> after<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.519> instance<00:02:47.849> that<00:02:47.909> soft<00:02:48.329> reset

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
and after the instance that soft reset

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.360 
and after the instance that soft reset
if<00:02:49.019> you<00:02:49.260> guys<00:02:49.409> don't<00:02:49.650> know<00:02:49.709> what<00:02:49.829> that<00:02:50.010> is

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
if you guys don't know what that is

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.610 
if you guys don't know what that is
it's<00:02:51.030> about<00:02:51.180> after<00:02:51.510> about<00:02:51.659> a<00:02:51.720> half<00:02:51.900> hour<00:02:52.109> so

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
it's about after about a half hour so

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.369 
it's about after about a half hour so
the<00:02:53.099> instance<00:02:53.459> will<00:02:53.700> kind<00:02:54.090> of<00:02:54.150> like<00:02:54.359> do<00:02:54.629> like<00:02:54.870> a

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
the instance will kind of like do like a

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.280 
the instance will kind of like do like a
reset<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.549> it's<00:02:57.120> it's<00:02:57.389> a<00:02:57.540> different<00:02:57.569> reset

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
reset and it's it's a different reset

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.349 
reset and it's it's a different reset
than<00:02:58.560> reset<00:02:59.010> if<00:02:59.129> you<00:02:59.250> reset<00:02:59.670> all<00:02:59.790> instances

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
than reset if you reset all instances

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.770 
than reset if you reset all instances
and<00:03:00.950> it's<00:03:01.950> like<00:03:02.129> it<00:03:02.340> with<00:03:02.549> ICC<00:03:03.090> I<00:03:03.389> give<00:03:03.629> the

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
and it's like it with ICC I give the

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.030 
and it's like it with ICC I give the
wait<00:03:03.930> for<00:03:04.109> a<00:03:04.139> soft<00:03:04.409> we<00:03:04.530> said<00:03:04.769> if<00:03:04.889> somebody

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
wait for a soft we said if somebody

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.369 
wait for a soft we said if somebody
turned<00:03:05.310> off<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.670> buff<00:03:05.879> and<00:03:06.329> it's<00:03:06.989> a<00:03:07.079> couple<00:03:07.319> of

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
turned off the buff and it's a couple of

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:08.420 
turned off the buff and it's a couple of
things<00:03:07.500> like<00:03:07.620> that<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:07.829> it<00:03:08.129> kind<00:03:08.280> of<00:03:08.340> like

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
things like that and it kind of like

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.580 
things like that and it kind of like
resets<00:03:08.849> all<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.090> trash<00:03:09.389> back<00:03:09.930> to<00:03:10.109> the<00:03:10.349> way<00:03:10.470> it

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
resets all the trash back to the way it

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.110 
resets all the trash back to the way it
should<00:03:10.620> be<00:03:10.829> with<00:03:11.099> that<00:03:11.280> boss<00:03:11.489> being<00:03:11.790> cleared

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
should be with that boss being cleared

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.009 
should be with that boss being cleared
and<00:03:12.329> so<00:03:13.230> if<00:03:13.620> you<00:03:13.950> if<00:03:14.280> it<00:03:14.519> does<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:14.730> soft<00:03:15.090> reset<00:03:15.329> it

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
and so if you if it does a soft reset it

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.930 
and so if you if it does a soft reset it
removes<00:03:16.439> all<00:03:16.739> this<00:03:17.069> trash<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:17.609> you<00:03:17.699> can<00:03:17.819> no

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
removes all this trash and you can no

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.819 
removes all this trash and you can no
longer<00:03:18.150> do<00:03:18.419> this<00:03:18.599> run<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.049> so<00:03:19.650> it's<00:03:19.799> very

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
longer do this run and so it's very

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.640 
longer do this run and so it's very

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.649 
but at the same time you want to be
aware<00:03:38.489> of<00:03:38.549> it<00:03:38.760> just<00:03:38.909> so<00:03:39.090> you<00:03:39.120> know<00:03:39.329> just<00:03:39.510> like

go afk if you are going to go afk while

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.430 
go afk if you are going to go afk while
you're<00:03:42.150> doing<00:03:42.449> this<00:03:42.599> you<00:03:43.019> want<00:03:43.049> to<00:03:43.229> do<00:03:43.319> it

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
you're doing this you want to do it

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.460 
you're doing this you want to do it
inside<00:03:43.739> the<00:03:43.919> instance<00:03:44.310> and<00:03:44.840> bwl<00:03:45.840> is<00:03:46.049> of<00:03:46.229> course

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
inside the instance and bwl is of course

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.780 
inside the instance and bwl is of course
a<00:03:46.709> one-hour<00:03:47.190> or<00:03:47.669> a<00:03:48.739> one-week<00:03:49.739> walkout<00:03:50.310> and<00:03:50.549> so

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
a one-hour or a one-week walkout and so

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.080 
a one-hour or a one-week walkout and so
you<00:03:51.440> basically<00:03:52.440> can<00:03:52.709> do<00:03:52.889> this<00:03:53.069> once<00:03:53.280> a<00:03:53.430> week<00:03:53.609> or

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
you basically can do this once a week or

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.539 
you basically can do this once a week or
as<00:03:54.329> long<00:03:54.449> as<00:03:54.629> you<00:03:54.720> want<00:03:54.959> I'm<00:03:55.919> not<00:03:55.979> really<00:03:56.280> sure

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659 
if there's another way to circumvent

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:00.559 
if there's another way to circumvent
that<00:03:58.169> right<00:03:58.409> now<00:03:58.590> I<00:03:59.190> I<00:03:59.609> didn't<00:04:00.090> really<00:04:00.329> find

that right now I I didn't really find
one<00:04:00.870> and<00:04:01.169> so<00:04:01.379> if<00:04:01.500> you<00:04:01.650> guys<00:04:01.859> find<00:04:02.220> one<00:04:02.459> let<00:04:02.940> me

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 
can't I I'd say like I made like a

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:23.089 
can't I I'd say like I made like a
thousand<00:04:21.269> gold<00:04:21.449> maybe<00:04:21.779> maybe<00:04:22.710> a<00:04:22.800> little<00:04:22.919> bit

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
thousand gold maybe maybe a little bit

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:25.519 
thousand gold maybe maybe a little bit
more<00:04:23.340> maybe<00:04:23.550> a<00:04:23.669> little<00:04:23.849> bit<00:04:23.940> less<00:04:24.120> and<00:04:24.529> this

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:25.529 
more maybe a little bit less and this

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:27.290 
more maybe a little bit less and this
videos<00:04:25.860> twelve<00:04:26.190> minutes<00:04:26.490> long<00:04:26.639> and

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
videos twelve minutes long and

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.300 
videos twelve minutes long and
so<00:04:27.389> you<00:04:27.900> can<00:04:28.050> expect<00:04:28.379> to<00:04:28.470> make<00:04:28.680> about<00:04:28.889> four<00:04:29.159> to

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
so you can expect to make about four to

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.029 
so you can expect to make about four to
five<00:04:29.490> thousand<00:04:29.970> gold<00:04:30.120> per<00:04:30.330> hour<00:04:30.479> doing<00:04:30.840> this

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 
five thousand gold per hour doing this

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:33.290 
five thousand gold per hour doing this
if<00:04:32.039> you're<00:04:32.280> on<00:04:32.460> a<00:04:32.490> very<00:04:32.819> low<00:04:33.060> population

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
if you're on a very low population

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.510 
if you're on a very low population

going to sell that well then you're

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:38.930 
going to sell that well then you're

doing this over and over and over and
over<00:05:07.080> and<00:05:07.379> it's<00:05:07.590> obviously<00:05:08.159> not<00:05:08.280> a<00:05:08.460> cap<00:05:08.759> to<00:05:09.030> it

know you probably should just kill the
technicians<00:05:21.780> and<00:05:22.169> then<00:05:22.469> use<00:05:22.710> your<00:05:23.120> invisible

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
technicians and then use your invisible

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.110 
technicians and then use your invisible
you're<00:05:24.780> fucked<00:05:25.110> if<00:05:26.069> you're<00:05:26.370> a<00:05:26.400> paladin<00:05:26.879> you're

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
can get the Salian war banner which is a

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.189 
can get the Salian war banner which is a
draw<00:05:38.610> from<00:05:38.759> the<00:05:38.909> Salian<00:05:39.360> war<00:05:39.569> Scout<00:05:39.870> in<00:05:40.139> a

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199 
draw from the Salian war Scout in a

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:42.499 
draw from the Salian war Scout in a
valley<00:05:40.979> of<00:05:41.130> the<00:05:41.279> four<00:05:41.550> winds<00:05:41.759> and<00:05:42.150> that'll

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:42.509 
valley of the four winds and that'll

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:44.269 
valley of the four winds and that'll
allow<00:05:42.539> you<00:05:42.750> to<00:05:43.139> go<00:05:43.409> invisible<00:05:43.680> and<00:05:44.069> drop

00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:44.279 
allow you to go invisible and drop

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:46.670 
allow you to go invisible and drop
combat<00:05:44.729> once<00:05:44.969> every<00:05:45.180> ten<00:05:45.479> minutes<00:05:45.509> and<00:05:46.110> so

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
combat once every ten minutes and so

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.439 
combat once every ten minutes and so
obviously<00:05:47.130> that's<00:05:47.310> just<00:05:47.460> vastly<00:05:48.120> inferior

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:48.449 
obviously that's just vastly inferior

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:52.129 
obviously that's just vastly inferior
literally<00:05:49.219> over<00:05:50.219> five<00:05:50.490> times<00:05:50.849> as<00:05:51.270> inferior<00:05:51.900> as

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:52.139 
literally over five times as inferior as

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:54.800 
literally over five times as inferior as
