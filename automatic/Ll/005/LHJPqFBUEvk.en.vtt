 prerequisite are not afraid of dirt 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.790
 and effort at the limit 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.980

 Construction work then goes with this 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.070
 Master the budding all-shove of how 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.380
 then it will be a rehearsal for 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.780
 the run and should I until the end of the 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.330
 create a route then wait for that 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.770
 take me without a clever shower 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.790
 me my team that is no longer in the 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.790
 Car home 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:38.190
 the subject field just plug forum 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:40.890
 that's exactly what is expected now 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:44.090
 a budding wildsau at the touran or 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.530
 wildsau there on wednesday there is euro approx 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.360
 and for dirt and a bit 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.220
 overcoming it is a we have to 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.350
 for large building that is always 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.580
 meters high we have wall bars 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:59.190
 second part again and then it starts 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.899
 in the basin of the French duos and 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.970
 Enjoyed so much right down to the 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.460
 skin and bones then a few smaller ones 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.800
 Obstacles on the track because the whole 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.360
 sink important role was without the leaves 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.519
 it 's not just when you look at homes 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.980
 see that everything remains clean the 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.540
 leave participants alone 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.580
 that suits the weather like it was today 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.130
 actually perfect for running many 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.440
 Cases like sticks to build 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.880
 so far after a laundry during construction 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.620
 what they are important for you is that 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.540
 to prepare everything so well 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.670
 gad eg is that all this whole 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.709
 Danish singer stuck that this 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.930
 everything turns out to be an obstacle 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.780
 is usually so horner to 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.380
 of course, sleep is preparation 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.570
 Of course, we like it best 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.980
 to work out monstranz grad and 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.579
 sunshine is always the last 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.950
 lowered 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.480
 under water and as you go to 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.140
 For example, help with a pool bruise 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.670
 have to 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.560
 standard frame tractors trailers 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.360
 come in fine and 15,000 one 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.700
 but as I said as today who 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.730
 as perfect weather for how long itself 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.350
 the parcours course itself is the 800 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.350
 meter long that he is about 15 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.060
 obstacles inside and resources the 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.170
 we stretch our beautiful distance 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.400
 sent and there are different 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.120
 possibilities 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.920
 thorsten run 5 km 10 km or 20 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.709
 kilometers and in sports 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.510
 can join in that, there are 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.850
 costume evaluations for example for 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.609
 athletic happy when he runs that 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.560
 a big part will bring fun on 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:24.390
 dress up and then has to throw up 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.360
 Now we come to that it makes your 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.540
 mother straight 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:33.930
 that will last until two days in the fire 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:38.520
 or dirty, it is but natural 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.520
 would have finished looking great too 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.080
 I have now sheltered myself 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.120
 looked for the sowwetter it schneider 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.400
 just neat to show them 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.820
 where ever the will of the urge on 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.860
 14 april takes place and that we are 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.560
 in the health claim of the so-called 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.630
 Health care is next to the loading bach 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.660
 you can see it here on the map and it 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.390
 is in the district st pÃ¶lten land and the 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.250
 this is about 50 kilometers 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.260
 from Vienna and is located on 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.540
 western edge of the wienerwald 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.130
 our trees and because of the health 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.560
 claim in a shadow position 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.510
 is it quite like wet and 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.220
 cool than in the direct environment 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.620
 that means that the chance is very big 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.450
 is the beginning of April, or has it 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.640
 instead of snow still lies here and 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.900
 Of course that makes the race and that 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.900
 mud bath even harder 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.620
 as the real with the theme 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:09.860
 Safety is always safe with us 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.630
 says big probably that's always 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.590
 that the obstacles accordingly 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.500
 we have secured 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.630
 care for the person who cares 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.160
 when problems there somewhere 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.900
 to say that for the 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.990
 Runner the man is portable then there is 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.580
 at least part of it later 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.590
 the obstacle of one so that one nets 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.900
 and cycling a close to safety 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.100
 the teeth and one area one 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.280
 dry area where you can get a bit 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.510
 may withdraw it was god as a 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.550
 needs yes that is a whole 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:40.640
 more important the dry areas 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:42.800
 movement in turn the gastro tent 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.620
 because they are not that special 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.680
 whole distance understandable all the way 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.450
 understandable and time is the first 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.530
 shows that , of course, very special 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.240
 to be faithful 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.920
 and if the weather catches our attention 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.170
 then we would be in my skin 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.620
 cut small town so that the floor completely 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.620
 dry 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.550
 so 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.430
 The rain is now too snow 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:08.830

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.599

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.610
 that I go for the test run at the 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:14.319
