00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.110 
nearest graveyard so it is also an a way

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.930 
nearest graveyard so it is also an a way
of<00:06:53.000> fast<00:06:54.000> transport<00:06:54.660> so<00:06:55.140> the<00:06:55.950> moment<00:06:56.160> you<00:06:56.430> go

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:56.940
