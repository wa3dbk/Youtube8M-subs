melon that I'm going to review probably

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.870 
melon that I'm going to review probably
because<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:21.180> don't<00:00:21.660> like<00:00:21.930> melons<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:23.340> don't

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
because I don't like melons I don't

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.089 
because I don't like melons I don't
really<00:00:24.060> think<00:00:24.390> they're<00:00:24.900> very<00:00:25.109> interesting<00:00:25.890> I

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
really think they're very interesting I

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.689 
really think they're very interesting I
see<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.699> lot<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.449> different<00:00:27.810> melons<00:00:28.199> when<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.439> go

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
see a lot of different melons when I go

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.939 
see a lot of different melons when I go
to<00:00:29.840> markets<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:30.960> even<00:00:31.109> if<00:00:31.320> I've<00:00:31.439> never<00:00:31.619> had

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
to markets and even if I've never had

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.069 
to markets and even if I've never had
them<00:00:32.160> before<00:00:32.309> they<00:00:33.300> don't<00:00:33.510> capture<00:00:33.750> my

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
them before they don't capture my

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.450 
them before they don't capture my
interest<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.680> me<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:34.980> it's<00:00:35.100> just<00:00:35.160> kind<00:00:35.430> of

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
interest to me and it's just kind of

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.940 
interest to me and it's just kind of
like<00:00:36.079> whatever<00:00:37.079> it's<00:00:37.380> probably<00:00:37.649> gonna<00:00:37.739> taste

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
like whatever it's probably gonna taste

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.400 
like whatever it's probably gonna taste
like<00:00:38.070> cantaloupe<00:00:38.670> or<00:00:38.969> honeydew<00:00:39.300> or<00:00:39.960> something

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
like cantaloupe or honeydew or something

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.810 
like cantaloupe or honeydew or something
so<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.309> don't<00:00:41.579> get<00:00:41.700> too<00:00:41.910> excited<00:00:42.030> about<00:00:42.540> melons

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
so I don't get too excited about melons

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.540 
so I don't get too excited about melons
but<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:45.300> one<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.899> picked<00:00:46.289> up<00:00:46.469> not<00:00:47.219> because

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
but this one I picked up not because

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.090 
but this one I picked up not because
it's<00:00:48.120> interesting<00:00:48.690> but<00:00:49.559> it's<00:00:49.710> got<00:00:49.950> an

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
it's interesting but it's got an

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.279 
it's interesting but it's got an
interesting<00:00:50.520> name<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.480> this<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.750> called<00:00:52.079> the

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
interesting name and this is called the

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.700 
interesting name and this is called the
Santa<00:00:52.920> Claus<00:00:53.270> melon<00:00:54.270> it's<00:00:55.110> called<00:00:55.410> that

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
Santa Claus melon it's called that

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.040 
Santa Claus melon it's called that
because<00:00:56.550> these<00:00:57.270> are<00:00:58.879> like<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.910> hearty<00:01:00.539> melon

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
because these are like a hearty melon

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.609 
because these are like a hearty melon
like<00:01:01.320> they<00:01:01.500> they<00:01:02.100> last<00:01:02.370> really<00:01:02.879> long<00:01:03.090> time<00:01:03.619> on

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
like they they last really long time on

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.980 
like they they last really long time on
the<00:01:04.769> Shelf<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:06.060> can<00:01:06.270> eat<00:01:06.450> them<00:01:06.659> until

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
the Shelf that you can eat them until

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.690 
the Shelf that you can eat them until
Christmas<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.890> that's<00:01:07.979> where<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.310> gets<00:01:08.490> its

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
Christmas and that's where it gets its

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.060 
Christmas and that's where it gets its
name<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.360> even<00:01:09.689> when<00:01:10.380> they're<00:01:10.500> not<00:01:10.650> growing

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
name so even when they're not growing

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.710 
name so even when they're not growing
you<00:01:11.400> can<00:01:11.549> still<00:01:11.760> be<00:01:11.880> eating<00:01:12.180> these<00:01:12.330> melons

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
you can still be eating these melons

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.260 
you can still be eating these melons
fresh<00:01:13.110> because<00:01:13.460> it<00:01:14.460> takes<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.700> long<00:01:14.939> time<00:01:14.970> for

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
fresh because it takes a long time for

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.100 
fresh because it takes a long time for
them<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:16.020> go<00:01:16.979> bad<00:01:17.250> I've<00:01:17.939> actually<00:01:18.180> had<00:01:18.509> this

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.719 

for<00:01:22.110> about<00:01:22.320> two<00:01:22.590> weeks<00:01:22.890> on<00:01:23.310> my<00:01:24.000> my<00:01:24.930> table<00:01:25.439> and

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
for about two weeks on my my table and

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.060 
for about two weeks on my my table and
God<00:01:26.729> knows<00:01:26.939> how<00:01:27.150> long<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.600> was<00:01:27.750> at<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.650> at<00:01:28.950> the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
God knows how long it was at the at the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.149 
God knows how long it was at the at the
market<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.600> has<00:01:30.780> probably<00:01:31.170> already<00:01:31.229> been

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
market so this has probably already been

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.270 
market so this has probably already been
picked<00:01:32.520> like<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.790> over<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.360> month<00:01:33.630> ago<00:01:34.250> when<00:01:35.250> I

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
picked like a over a month ago when I

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.490 
picked like a over a month ago when I
first<00:01:35.520> got<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:36.119> thing<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.630> was<00:01:36.750> very<00:01:37.079> hard

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
first got this thing it was very hard

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.830 
first got this thing it was very hard
and<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.640> way<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.820> can<00:01:38.939> tell<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.450> it's<00:01:39.600> right

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
and the way you can tell that it's right

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.289 
and the way you can tell that it's right
is<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.770> yields<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.579> little<00:01:41.850> bit<00:01:42.060> like

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
is that it it yields a little bit like

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.850 
is that it it yields a little bit like
that<00:01:42.329> not<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.780> whole<00:01:43.020> lot<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.470> don't<00:01:43.590> want<00:01:43.799> it

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
that not a whole lot you don't want it

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.280 
that not a whole lot you don't want it
to<00:01:43.920> be<00:01:44.009> soft<00:01:44.369> like<00:01:44.880> but<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.689> want<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.140> like

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
to be soft like but you want it to like

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.780 
to be soft like but you want it to like
just<00:01:46.560> give<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.070> little<00:01:47.280> under<00:01:47.759> pressure

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
just give a little under pressure

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.410 
just give a little under pressure
especially<00:01:48.420> on<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.110> ends<00:01:50.000> it's<00:01:51.000> not<00:01:51.149> supposed

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
especially on the ends it's not supposed

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.030 
especially on the ends it's not supposed
to<00:01:51.479> really<00:01:51.659> give<00:01:51.990> off<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.170> smell<00:01:52.500> when<00:01:53.009> it's

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
to really give off a smell when it's

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.630 
to really give off a smell when it's
ripe<00:01:53.430> as<00:01:54.030> some<00:01:54.299> melons<00:01:54.600> do<00:01:54.840> but<00:01:55.189> honestly<00:01:56.189> this

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
ripe as some melons do but honestly this

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.510 
ripe as some melons do but honestly this
is<00:01:56.820> giving<00:01:57.149> off<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.689> smell<00:01:58.590> like

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
is giving off a smell like

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.810 
is giving off a smell like
so<00:02:00.329> I'm<00:02:00.689> guessing<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.829> time<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.399> open<00:02:02.700> this

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
so I'm guessing it is time to open this

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:23.280 
so I'm guessing it is time to open this
up

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.839 

hmmm<00:02:23.920> it's<00:02:24.430> just<00:02:24.909> as<00:02:25.060> good<00:02:25.120> as<00:02:25.390> anything<00:02:26.849> it's

hmmm it's just as good as anything it's
quite<00:02:28.450> strong<00:02:28.870> smelling<00:02:29.379> I<00:02:30.510> see<00:02:31.510> this<00:02:31.659> smells

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
quite strong smelling I see this smells

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.410 
quite strong smelling I see this smells
quite<00:02:32.349> a<00:02:32.439> bit<00:02:32.590> like<00:02:32.799> honeydew<00:02:33.400> well<00:02:34.150> I'm<00:02:34.299> gonna
