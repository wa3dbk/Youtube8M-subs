looking at the read on of the patent
proof<00:00:55.660> this<00:00:55.899> so<00:00:56.770> to<00:00:56.829> go<00:00:57.370> back<00:00:57.730> this<00:00:58.120> patent

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540

discusses<00:00:59.489> using<00:01:00.489> historical<00:01:00.610> lifts<00:01:01.450> and

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
discusses using historical lifts and

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.469 
discusses using historical lifts and
retrieving<00:01:02.290> that<00:01:02.440> data<00:01:02.800> so<00:01:03.670> it's<00:01:03.969> the<00:01:04.119> idea

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
retrieving that data so it's the idea

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.990 
retrieving that data so it's the idea
when<00:01:04.809> you<00:01:04.930> type<00:01:05.140> in<00:01:05.290> a<00:01:05.379> few<00:01:05.619> words<00:01:05.860> if<00:01:06.610> it's

now to look at all the elements of the

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:25.980 
now to look at all the elements of the
claim<00:01:22.539> let's<00:01:23.170> see<00:01:23.499> where<00:01:24.990> Samsung

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990

specifically can go in and try to fight
so<00:01:30.100> to<00:01:30.130> begin<00:01:30.369> for<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.149> read<00:01:31.359> on<00:01:31.539> we'll<00:01:32.020> look

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
so to begin for the read on we'll look

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.739 
so to begin for the read on we'll look
at<00:01:32.380> claim<00:01:32.859> one<00:01:33.130> that<00:01:33.880> begins<00:01:34.209> at<00:01:34.420> saying<00:01:34.630> a

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
Android operates but i'm pretty sure

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.480 
Android operates but i'm pretty sure
that<00:02:25.630> they<00:02:25.750> use<00:02:25.930> a<00:02:25.960> memory<00:02:26.440> system<00:02:26.920> for

that they use a memory system for

at<00:02:35.860> this<00:02:36.040> point<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:36.550> now<00:02:37.240> it<00:02:37.450> says<00:02:37.720> a<00:02:38.080> cpu<00:02:38.740> for

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
at this point and now it says a cpu for

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.740 
at this point and now it says a cpu for

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
the data so i'm not too sure if this is

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.520 
the data so i'm not too sure if this is

would<00:02:56.560> also<00:02:56.800> think<00:02:57.520> that<00:02:58.320> samsung's<00:02:59.320> products

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
would also think that samsung's products

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
would follow with this as well but maybe

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.660 
would follow with this as well but maybe
they<00:03:02.140> have<00:03:02.230> a<00:03:02.290> different<00:03:02.650> name<00:03:02.950> for<00:03:03.010> it<00:03:03.520> so

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
they have a different name for it so

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.230 
they have a different name for it so
they<00:03:03.730> could<00:03:04.030> change<00:03:04.420> it<00:03:04.630> in<00:03:04.810> that<00:03:05.200> way<00:03:06.240> next

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
they could change it in that way next

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.720 
they could change it in that way next

things word gets completed based off of

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.760 
things word gets completed based off of
your<00:04:42.190> history<00:04:42.370> which<00:04:42.910> is<00:04:43.120> pretty<00:04:43.930> much<00:04:44.080> the

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
your history which is pretty much the

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.420 
your history which is pretty much the
patent<00:04:45.250> in<00:04:45.460> general<00:04:45.970> so<00:04:46.780> while<00:04:47.770> it's<00:04:48.040> a<00:04:48.160> little

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
patent in general so while it's a little

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.360 
patent in general so while it's a little
wordy<00:04:48.960> I'm<00:04:49.960> not<00:04:50.380> sure<00:04:50.740> how<00:04:50.889> they<00:04:51.070> can<00:04:51.250> get

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
wordy I'm not sure how they can get

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.969 
wordy I'm not sure how they can get
around<00:04:51.490> it<00:04:51.940> but<00:04:52.150> maybe<00:04:52.570> they<00:04:52.900> can<00:04:53.139> say<00:04:53.380> we're

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
around it but maybe they can say we're

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:55.770 
around it but maybe they can say we're
not<00:04:54.010> using<00:04:54.370> history<00:04:54.910> of<00:04:55.060> words<00:04:55.300> we're<00:04:55.600> using

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
not using history of words we're using

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.860 
not using history of words we're using
some<00:04:56.740> sort<00:04:56.949> of<00:04:57.130> intelligence<00:04:57.940> to<00:04:58.270> complete

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
some sort of intelligence to complete

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.760 
some sort of intelligence to complete
the<00:04:59.050> words<00:04:59.260> based<00:04:59.710> off<00:04:59.949> of<00:04:59.979> the<00:05:00.130> inception<00:05:00.669> of

the words based off of the inception of

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.790 
the words based off of the inception of
the<00:05:02.770> mobile<00:05:03.070> device<00:05:03.820> or<00:05:04.120> tablet<00:05:04.990> or<00:05:05.199> music

the mobile device or tablet or music

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.719 
the mobile device or tablet or music
device<00:05:06.130> so<00:05:06.940> there<00:05:07.360> are<00:05:07.389> opportunities<00:05:08.729> for

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
device so there are opportunities for

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:12.120 
device so there are opportunities for
them<00:05:09.880> to<00:05:09.970> work<00:05:10.300> around<00:05:10.449> it<00:05:10.780> also<00:05:11.710> I<00:05:11.740> was

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
them to work around it also I was

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.270 
them to work around it also I was
reading<00:05:12.580> a<00:05:13.139> article<00:05:14.139> and<00:05:14.380> it<00:05:14.590> was<00:05:14.650> a<00:05:14.919> pretty

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
reading a article and it was a pretty

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.430 
reading a article and it was a pretty
funny<00:05:15.580> way<00:05:15.760> of<00:05:15.789> phrasing<00:05:16.180> that<00:05:16.570> Apple<00:05:17.350> is

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
funny way of phrasing that Apple is

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.320 
funny way of phrasing that Apple is
still<00:05:17.650> trying<00:05:17.979> to<00:05:18.280> sue<00:05:18.520> the<00:05:18.729> world<00:05:18.940> into
