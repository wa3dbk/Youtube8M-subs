I was getting ready to make a little
container<00:00:05.850> garden<00:00:06.450> for<00:00:06.779> my<00:00:07.259> herbs<00:00:07.529> and<00:00:08.059> the

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
container garden for my herbs and the

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.400 
container garden for my herbs and the

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
reason I'm doing this is so I have them

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.499 
reason I'm doing this is so I have them
right<00:00:10.440> outside<00:00:10.740> my<00:00:11.010> door<00:00:11.219> so<00:00:11.820> when<00:00:12.059> I<00:00:12.120> want<00:00:12.389> to

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
right outside my door so when I want to

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.450 
right outside my door so when I want to
use<00:00:12.690> them<00:00:12.900> in<00:00:13.019> some<00:00:13.259> food<00:00:13.500> I<00:00:13.679> can<00:00:13.860> just<00:00:14.009> run<00:00:14.280> out

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
use them in some food I can just run out

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.029 
use them in some food I can just run out
the<00:00:14.580> door<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.880> grab<00:00:15.120> some<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:16.440> I<00:00:16.680> figured<00:00:16.949> I'd

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
the door and grab some and I figured I'd

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.070 
the door and grab some and I figured I'd
just<00:00:17.190> show<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:17.490> how<00:00:17.820> I'm<00:00:17.910> doing<00:00:18.180> it<00:00:21.080> first

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
I did is I took my wife about a 2 inches

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.060 
I did is I took my wife about a 2 inches
up<00:00:48.300> from<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.660> bottom<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.260> container<00:00:49.620> and

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
up from the bottom of the container and

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.139 
up from the bottom of the container and
I<00:00:50.640> drilled<00:00:50.969> holes<00:00:51.260> all<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.320> way<00:00:52.500> around<00:00:53.149> to

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
I drilled holes all the way around to

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.080 
I drilled holes all the way around to
let<00:00:54.270> excess<00:00:54.690> water<00:00:54.930> out<00:00:55.820> losing<00:00:56.820> my<00:00:56.850> balance

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
let excess water out losing my balance

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.590 
let excess water out losing my balance
here<00:00:57.920> and<00:00:58.920> then<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.250> took<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.180> didn't<00:01:00.449> have

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
here and then I took and I didn't have

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.180 
here and then I took and I didn't have
gravel<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.260> just<00:01:01.440> took<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.710> bunch<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:02.010> big

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
gravel so I just took a bunch of big

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.050 
gravel so I just took a bunch of big
rocks<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:03.140> filled<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.260> bottom<00:01:04.619> up<00:01:04.830> past<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
rocks and filled the bottom up past the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.109 
rocks and filled the bottom up past the
holes<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.720> drilled<00:01:07.760> which<00:01:08.760> will<00:01:08.970> help

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
holes that I drilled which will help

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.810 
holes that I drilled which will help
keep<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.229> dirt<00:01:10.439> from<00:01:10.619> running<00:01:11.159> out<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.640> it'll

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
keep the dirt from running out and it'll

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.990 
keep the dirt from running out and it'll
also<00:01:12.060> uh<00:01:12.560> just<00:01:13.560> give<00:01:13.830> some<00:01:14.070> aeration<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.790> there

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
also uh just give some aeration in there

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.880 
also uh just give some aeration in there
and<00:01:15.210> keep<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.720> roots<00:01:15.900> from<00:01:16.080> standing<00:01:16.710> and

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
and keep the roots from standing and

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.690 
and keep the roots from standing and
water<00:01:17.299> now<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.360> reason<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.810> came<00:01:18.900> up<00:01:19.320> an<00:01:19.470> inch

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
water now the reason I came up an inch

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.450 
water now the reason I came up an inch
or<00:01:20.700> two<00:01:20.880> inches<00:01:21.210> here<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:22.020> when<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:22.860> water<00:01:23.130> this

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
or two inches here is when I water this

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.640 
or two inches here is when I water this
this<00:01:24.240> area<00:01:24.600> down<00:01:24.780> here<00:01:24.810> will<00:01:25.170> be<00:01:25.290> full<00:01:25.530> of

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
this area down here will be full of

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.580 
this area down here will be full of
water<00:01:26.450> so<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.479> won't<00:01:27.689> have<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:28.020> water<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.380> as

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
water so I won't have to water it as

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.440 
water so I won't have to water it as
often<00:01:28.829> because<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.549> water<00:01:29.790> will<00:01:30.060> work<00:01:30.240> its

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
often because that water will work its

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.960 
often because that water will work its
way<00:01:30.630> up<00:01:30.710> but<00:01:31.710> it'll<00:01:31.860> still<00:01:32.189> keep<00:01:32.430> those<00:01:32.610> roots

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
way up but it'll still keep those roots

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.789 
way up but it'll still keep those roots
from<00:01:33.180> standing<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.960> water<00:01:34.140> which<00:01:34.439> isn't

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
from standing in the water which isn't

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.740 
from standing in the water which isn't
good<00:01:36.560> now<00:01:37.560> what<00:01:37.710> I'm<00:01:37.829> going<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.009> do<00:01:38.540> is<00:01:39.540> I'll

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
good now what I'm going to do is I'll

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.410 
good now what I'm going to do is I'll
just<00:01:39.930> fill<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.350> up<00:01:40.560> with<00:01:40.619> dirt<00:01:41.420> I'll

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
just fill this up with dirt I'll

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.130 
just fill this up with dirt I'll
probably<00:01:42.630> just<00:01:42.810> use<00:01:43.140> dirt<00:01:43.470> out<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.799> garden

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
probably just use dirt out of the garden

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.539 
probably just use dirt out of the garden
alright<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:46.470> now<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.189> got<00:01:47.220> all<00:01:47.460> those

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
alright so now that I got all those

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.069 
alright so now that I got all those
rocks<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:48.060> there<00:01:48.210> it's<00:01:48.360> kind<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.630> heavy<00:01:48.840> and

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
rocks in there it's kind of heavy and

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.539 
rocks in there it's kind of heavy and
it's<00:01:49.200> hard<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.500> move<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.070> went<00:01:50.310> ahead<00:01:50.399> and

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
it's hard to move so I went ahead and

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.600 
it's hard to move so I went ahead and
did<00:01:50.729> something<00:01:51.180> else<00:01:51.450> here

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.320 

I<00:01:56.530> just<00:01:57.530> put<00:01:57.710> some<00:01:57.860> handles<00:01:58.190> on<00:01:58.400> it<00:01:58.430> again<00:01:59.300> I

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.200 
I just put some handles on it again I
just<00:01:59.480> drilled<00:01:59.900> two<00:02:00.110> holes<00:02:00.140> with<00:02:00.500> a<00:02:00.590> knife<00:02:01.210> one

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210

probably<00:02:33.459> somewhere<00:02:34.459> between<00:02:34.520> three<00:02:35.180> and

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
probably somewhere between three and

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.920 
probably somewhere between three and
four<00:02:35.600> square<00:02:35.989> feet<00:02:36.260> of<00:02:36.530> garden<00:02:36.890> space<00:02:37.340> here

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
four square feet of garden space here

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.720 
four square feet of garden space here
probably<00:02:38.930> about<00:02:39.050> three<00:02:39.350> feet<00:02:39.590> of<00:02:39.860> three
