00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.679
 this propaganda propaganda us not 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.790
 interested in the bare facts interest us 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.240
 cause and effect 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.390
 the truth is always one hello munich 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.930
 Moscow Berlin 4000 kilometers of Berlin 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.640
 washington berlin 14000 berlin minsk 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.099
 berlin two and a half thousand kilometers 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.230
 this is 20 thousand kilometers 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.240
 half equator in less than a week 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.000
 this trajectory of the federal movement 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.800
 Chancellor Angels Merkel 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.170
 add here 17 hour talks 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.629
 bad taste refer to age of course 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.300
 but when you are 60 for such movements 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.430
 probably need some exceptional 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.140
 reason Europe as a whole and Germany in 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.660
 particular recalls today play 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.190
 and the bride who urgently needs 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.500
 determined by preferences 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.280
 began the lover's lo and each other 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.760
 shoot out 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.770
 until she herself is kidnapped the main outcome 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.890
 diplomatic week germany for the first time 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.070
 for decades timidly unsure but all 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.540
 she whispered distinctly weeks she 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.820
 uttered it at a conference in munich 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.850
 she repeated it in front of the cameras 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.310
 white house no germany sees 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.680
 there is no military solution to the Ukrainian crisis 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.920
 Germany does not support American 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.049
 plan for the supply of weapons to Kiev more 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.540
 weapons means more victims this is not 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.369
 will lead to the goal of change 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.390
 which Ukraine needs cannot be 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.430
 achieved by weapons I am always 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.650
 I said that I do not see how the conflict could 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.240
 to be allowed by military we must 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.000
 make every effort to find 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.950
 diplomatic decision as it were 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.020
 perceived like that for example senator 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.820
 McCain urged to start 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.530
 armament of Ukraine responded to 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.070
 Merkel speeches in one word 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.630
 stupidity and why stupidity is a refugee 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.820
 because in case of escalation of the conflict and 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.250
 NATO's involvement in it will not run 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.350
 arizona no american soldiers no 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.750
 American cities will be in first 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.579
 line under the gun washington pushes 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.829
 Europe to the abyss from which she 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.989
 climbing up the last 70 years 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.590
 Is it strange that even the most loyal 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.310
 the most obedient 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.390
 begin to rest at some point 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.819
 interests of Americans and Russians 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.830
 it is not the same as the interests of Europe and 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.629
 Russia, we do not want renewal 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.290
 cold war between europe and russia 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:28.480
 to the south of raids it seems to me the USA is not always 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.010
 understands that Europe has its own problems 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.019
 and Europe can not be considered 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.870
 tool serving global 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.400
 US interests on the same Munich 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.260
 conference this logic is good 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.599
 illustrated the German minister 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.700
 foreign affairs steinmeier he remembered 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.769
 conversation with your Canadian colleague 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.250
 who was interested in considering now 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:53.170
 Russia friend partner opponent or 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:55.239
 the enemy probably answer this question 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.170
 the easier the farther you are from 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.209
 conflict zones 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.760
 European experience is that their 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:04.090
 bad and good times russia remains 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.340
 our neighbor but here's what 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.530
 the problem is why does Europe take that 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.750
 she can decide something on her own 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.000
 from portugal to norway to her 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.730
 territories are still 28 american 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.590
 military bases in Germany alone eleven 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.819
 a total of 80 thousand 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.950
 military personnel 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.280
 Germany still keeps and protects 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.600
 American tactical nuclear weapons 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.190
 not today will be signed tomorrow 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.200
 the largest agreement ever 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.060
 free trade which is definitive 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.549
 will fix europe in american 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.459
 fairway since the time of marshal's plan nothing 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:38.970
 not changed who the girl is having dinner that her 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.970
 and dancing 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.200
 was involved in all the warriors who led 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.239
 the united states at least because 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.560
 all their military campaigns they 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.569
 stretched to infrastructure 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.609
 located in central europe we 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.500
 were accomplices in every war and on 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:56.470
 so long as it is so we cannot count 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.139
 yourself a sovereign state like this 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.169
 called occupation or semi occupation 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:03.700
 question debatable whether seriously 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:06.519
 hope that angelic patience 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.590
 merkel once burst hardly 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.950
 but neglect this let it be negligible 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.840
 low probability is also impossible but for now 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.000
 diplomatic round dance around the bundes 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.799
 the office continues into the lions 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.469
 the first 600 American go 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.539
 paratroopers they will teach commanders 

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:22.860
 Ukrainian punitive battalions as 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:26.009
 about 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:29.370
 on fight with artillery novorosii lunch 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:32.330
 lunch and the war on schedule it was 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.449
 agitation and propaganda see you soon world 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.449
