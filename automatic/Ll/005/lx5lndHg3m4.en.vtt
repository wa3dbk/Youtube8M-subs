00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.499 
I figured we'd start with the with the B
vodka<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:37.740> people<00:01:38.040> could<00:01:38.220> hear<00:01:38.430> what<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.180> hear

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509

yeah cool boss same properties yeah yeah
let's<00:03:10.410> just<00:03:10.590> stains<00:03:10.860> like<00:03:11.160> I<00:03:11.400> always<00:03:12.240> felt

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
let's just stains like I always felt

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.960 
let's just stains like I always felt
that<00:03:12.720> like<00:03:13.080> um<00:03:13.320> we<00:03:14.280> check<00:03:14.490> these<00:03:14.640> out<00:03:14.790> before

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
that like um we check these out before

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.330 
that like um we check these out before
this<00:03:15.330> so<00:03:15.480> this<00:03:15.690> one<00:03:15.900> was<00:03:16.080> like<00:03:16.260> just<00:03:16.590> really

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
this so this one was like just really

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.040 
this so this one was like just really
dead<00:03:17.550> on<00:03:17.730> you<00:03:18.120> had<00:03:18.210> to<00:03:18.300> be<00:03:18.450> a<00:03:18.480> lot<00:03:18.690> for<00:03:18.900> some

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
dead on you had to be a lot for some

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.920 
dead on you had to be a lot for some
reason<00:03:19.410> it<00:03:19.500> just<00:03:19.530> has<00:03:19.800> all<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.370> same

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
reason it just has all the same

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.880 
reason it just has all the same
characteristics<00:03:21.930> that<00:03:22.080> the<00:03:22.230> original<00:03:22.710> has

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
characteristics that the original has

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.830 
characteristics that the original has
yeah<00:03:23.280> yeah<00:03:23.610> it<00:03:23.790> they're<00:03:24.150> real<00:03:24.300> real<00:03:24.510> close

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
yeah yeah it they're real real close

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.580 
yeah yeah it they're real real close
real<00:03:25.200> close<00:03:25.380> if<00:03:25.980> not<00:03:26.190> identical<00:03:27.470> we're<00:03:28.470> also

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
real close if not identical we're also

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.990 
real close if not identical we're also
going<00:03:28.800> to<00:03:28.860> toggle<00:03:29.250> between<00:03:29.460> what<00:03:29.820> I'm<00:03:29.880> gonna

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
going to toggle between what I'm gonna

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.400 
going to toggle between what I'm gonna
do<00:03:30.150> now<00:03:30.270> is<00:03:30.450> let<00:03:30.690> Phil<00:03:30.870> play<00:03:31.080> I'm<00:03:31.200> going<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.350> a

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
do now is let Phil play I'm going to a

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.850 
do now is let Phil play I'm going to a
be<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:31.620> little<00:03:31.890> bit<00:03:32.090> again<00:03:33.090> like<00:03:33.300> the<00:03:33.420> Biba<00:03:33.860> in

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
be a little bit again like the Biba in

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.950 
be a little bit again like the Biba in
my<00:03:35.010> understanding<00:03:35.220> it's<00:03:35.880> just<00:03:36.180> it's<00:03:36.870> a<00:03:36.930> very

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960 
my understanding it's just it's a very

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.110 
my understanding it's just it's a very
bottom<00:03:37.530> heavy<00:03:37.680> fuzz<00:03:38.010> yes<00:03:38.400> with<00:03:38.730> a<00:03:38.760> little

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
bottom heavy fuzz yes with a little

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.140 
bottom heavy fuzz yes with a little
upper<00:03:39.720> octave<00:03:40.050> harmonic<00:03:40.770> to<00:03:41.520> it<00:03:41.640> as<00:03:41.760> well<00:03:41.910> just

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
upper octave harmonic to it as well just

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.970 
upper octave harmonic to it as well just
like<00:03:42.300> very<00:03:42.600> similar<00:03:42.870> to<00:03:42.990> the<00:03:43.080> superfun<00:03:43.500> not

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
like very similar to the superfun not

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.490 
like very similar to the superfun not
plays<00:03:44.250> much<00:03:44.580> yes<00:03:44.970> yeah<00:03:45.300> not<00:03:45.780> as<00:03:45.870> aggressive<00:03:46.050> a

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
plays much yes yeah not as aggressive a

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.010 
plays much yes yeah not as aggressive a
little<00:03:46.710> it's<00:03:46.950> a<00:03:47.010> little<00:03:47.040> smoother<00:03:47.760> but<00:03:48.300> the

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
little it's a little smoother but the

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.660 
little it's a little smoother but the
cool<00:03:49.170> thing<00:03:49.200> is<00:03:49.500> just<00:03:49.890> like<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.250> super<00:03:50.490> fuzz

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
cool thing is just like the super fuzz

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.600 
cool thing is just like the super fuzz
you<00:03:50.790> have<00:03:51.090> these<00:03:51.270> this<00:03:51.660> foot<00:03:52.110> switchable<00:03:52.610> tone

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
you have these this foot switchable tone

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.520 
you have these this foot switchable tone
setting<00:03:53.910> where<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.090> can<00:03:54.240> get<00:03:54.330> two<00:03:54.930> distinct

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
setting where you can get two distinct

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.110 
setting where you can get two distinct
different<00:03:55.830> photons<00:03:56.310> this<00:03:56.550> one's<00:03:56.760> more<00:03:56.910> of<00:03:57.030> the

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
different photons this one's more of the

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.050 
different photons this one's more of the
scooped<00:03:57.450> setting<00:03:58.380> the<00:03:58.590> other<00:03:58.710> ones<00:03:58.920> more<00:03:59.160> kind

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
scooped setting the other ones more kind

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.120 
scooped setting the other ones more kind
of<00:04:00.150> a<00:04:00.390> little<00:04:01.020> bump<00:04:01.200> in<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.380> mid<00:04:01.560> so<00:04:01.770> we'll

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
of a little bump in the mid so we'll

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.280 
of a little bump in the mid so we'll
toggle<00:04:02.310> between<00:04:02.520> those<00:04:02.880> right<00:04:03.630> now<00:04:03.810> okay<00:04:04.230> so

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
toggle between those right now okay so

00:04:04.290 --> 00:06:00.129 
toggle between those right now okay so
again<00:04:05.280> we'll<00:04:05.430> start<00:04:05.670> with<00:04:05.760> the

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:00.139 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:03.740
