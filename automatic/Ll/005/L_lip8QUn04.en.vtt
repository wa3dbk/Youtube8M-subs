00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:06.529
 It is January or less 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.529
 Just dog cat å…Ž method 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:26.590
 This method Sakai also a Hello hole betting ticket 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.920
 It is Tokyo newspaper cup held at Tokyo racecourse on Sunday today 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.760
 I have an expectation of this 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.760
 I think that want to go 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:45.030
 I think it is it in the Tokyo Shimbun Cup would like to introduce the expected point of here. 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.510
 I remember the Tokyo Newspaper Cup 9 Race 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.620
 The past, such as Toka hat trick is Suzuka Phoenix 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.239
 Sunday driving horse is 0 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:01:00.160
 I think that the image of stabbing from behind using a fast rise is strong 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:02.649
 It's been a while since the ambassador was gone in a decent mountain . 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:07.840
 There are many cases where there is no 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:09.940
 So the trend of the current Tokyo newspaper cup is still about a certain amount before the previous public 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.610
 A horse race that runs into from there 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.260
 This regulates 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:18.650
 girl It is characteristic of Tokyo newspaper cup that horse is strong 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:21.600
 I think it's better to keep your head in mind 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:26.610
 But it is a duel point 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:31.320
 The duel point for this race is three First of all, the Roberto system is very strong. This is every year. 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.460
 That erotic belt when an alarm is because horses to his father or mother father has a Roberto of the house is coming 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.689
 There is a tendency 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:41.590
 Because it is consistent with the recent trend of Yasuda memorial that this Roberto system is strong 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:46.060
 To gather together the strength of the Robert system in advanced conditions before Tokyo 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:49.479
 Or behind it is basically but is after I do not might want Like we said earlier in 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:54.250
 There is a system that lets you break in from a certain position rather than driving in 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:57.250
 It is weird to be able to do so, and it is mischievous or has a dart pedigree 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.310
 Last Massenet say is that strong 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.610
 This is the first time last year in this race Deep Impact production pieces 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.060
 I originally claimed to 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:09.470
 It is also rich in betting ticket areas together with the 12th most popular 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.780
 After all this too It is useless in the horse race to drive with a quick rise from behind too much 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.950
 I think that's one of the proof that say 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:19.580
 It seems to reach even wrote back because disappear about Deep Impact Naa Sunday Silence 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.600
 I'd Mont still from the fact that also was still useless for Tteyuu this less is 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:26.490
 A note that is persistent to some extent 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.690
 It can be said that it is necessary to assume a race called you while one head outskirts 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.850
 is not it 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.850
 Though I know this year's favorite horse from the fact that say 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:41.170
 This is a pick-up of a smart silhouette, and it is Lepe t 3 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.430
 Have a flying turf 3000 with Mr. Dart's pedigree to the Smarbo brother at the pass of the star 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.650
 It is not a pet 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:51.700
 It is the Tokyo newspaper that now that such a horse will never meet even if it leaves it to sustainability 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.010
 It is not a thing you are saying the previous one now is that it is a pattern 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.040
 so 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:03:00.900
 The ideal was a little more in frame, but there is a leg that goes before 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.859
 Hope wax Nde seems Karakishi useless and sounds but is both hope if Dekire waiting road Rina-chan 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.930
 Though 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:11.659
 I think it seems that it would be possible to flow in some time ago 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.659
 Please be on the alert for the rest of this horse this year 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:23.530
 It 's a notable pick-up on Sunday's attentional horse pick-up, and the Chukyo Shiba 2000 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:28.060
 I want to attack 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:31.819
 It was also taken up that Love Is Boucher that are out here it is Sunday Chukyo This race 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:35.719
 As it continues as many times already, how about Chukyo Shiba 2000 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:39.409
 The work is a course where a slow- footed horse is strong 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:44.450
 If you aim at this race from that point of view , speaking of this love is the company. 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:44.840
 Say that God even dad is going to the mother father Mejiro McQueen further mother father of longitude at the Well Hattan wall 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.159
 Ne 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.080
 Anyway comics that are blended in heavy lines with very slow legs this love is a year 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:54.220
 is 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.820
 He is, but in fact if you look Well results that this is that did not go up is not yet victory horse 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.110
 There is none 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.040
 Even just in the proof that it is still slow much foot I say not bought until now 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.930
 Because there is 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:08.260
 If it's a Baba that looks like it 's on the other side of the foot like this , then it's more like that. 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.100
 I think it can be said that the possibility to improve the performance comes out 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.090
 Unvictorious horse and popular in the chapter 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:20.800
 I think it seems like it would be a great presence if it would fall 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:20.800
 Those who can buy 3- connected betting are definitely better people to try 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:34.960
 Next week is the Queen's Cup on Saturday and the Joint Communication Cup on Sunday 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:39.760
 3 Toshiba Abstract or so will be made of it divided here on weekends 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:45.070
 I think the Fu that I want will explain and I will start Kokura gold from next week 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:46.280
 It 's easy to get addicted to a local horse racing game, but it's easy to get lost in Chukakyo. 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.450
 Though it was also so 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:55.700
 Ogura Mone, which starts with double bonds, has a rapidly changing trend 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:58.370
 By all means I China analyst also limited as Ara of this area it is the place to have larger than those of the pedigree trend 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.590
 I want to take up in the big up 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:05.570
 I hope you enjoy it 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:07.720

 Former major leaguer and Vilcina's horse-child, the great demon God Shirohiro Sasaki 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:23.230
 Major League Ball 22 is the second phase of the e-mail that reads the main pace from its own perspective
