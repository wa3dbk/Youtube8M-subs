were<00:02:33.890> a<00:02:33.950> little<00:02:34.610> bit<00:02:34.970> narrow<00:02:36.130> they<00:02:37.130> weren't<00:02:37.400> a

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
were a little bit narrow they weren't a

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
complete 100% perfect fit but they were

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.330 
complete 100% perfect fit but they were
close<00:02:41.000> enough<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.690> when<00:02:42.590> compared<00:02:43.040> to<00:02:43.130> the

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
close enough and when compared to the

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.270 
close enough and when compared to the
decals<00:02:44.000> that<00:02:44.120> came<00:02:44.330> with<00:02:44.570> it

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
decals that came with it

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.880 
decals that came with it
well<00:02:46.280> there<00:02:46.580> there<00:02:46.850> is<00:02:46.970> no<00:02:47.150> comparison<00:02:47.630> I<00:02:48.020> mean

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
well there there is no comparison I mean

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.449 
well there there is no comparison I mean
they<00:02:49.670> were<00:02:49.880> awkwardly<00:02:50.480> shaped<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:51.920> they

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
they were awkwardly shaped and they

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.940 
they were awkwardly shaped and they
didn't<00:02:52.850> line<00:02:53.060> up<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:53.780> these<00:02:54.410> are<00:02:54.590> just<00:02:54.709> great

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950

didn't line up and these are just great
I<00:02:55.070> mean<00:02:55.300> look<00:02:56.300> at<00:02:56.390> this<00:02:56.600> you<00:02:57.050> probably<00:02:57.290> can't

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
I mean look at this you probably can't

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.140 
I mean look at this you probably can't

a.m. so it is now 9:30 for so if I go to
bed<00:04:43.270> right<00:04:43.630> now<00:04:43.930> I'll<00:04:44.260> get<00:04:44.500> seven<00:04:44.890> and<00:04:45.010> a<00:04:45.040> half

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
bed right now I'll get seven and a half

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.050 
bed right now I'll get seven and a half
hours<00:04:45.490> of<00:04:45.640> sleep<00:04:47.460> so<00:04:48.460> I'm<00:04:48.580> just<00:04:48.700> gonna<00:04:48.820> I'm

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
hours of sleep so I'm just gonna I'm

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.960 
hours of sleep so I'm just gonna I'm
gonna<00:04:50.130> finish<00:04:51.130> up<00:04:51.340> what<00:04:51.490> I'm<00:04:51.550> doing<00:04:51.760> right<00:04:51.940> now

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
gonna finish up what I'm doing right now

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.250 
gonna finish up what I'm doing right now
and<00:04:52.300> then<00:04:52.390> I'm<00:04:52.540> gonna<00:04:52.630> set<00:04:52.870> it<00:04:52.960> aside<00:04:53.050> until

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
and then I'm gonna set it aside until

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.560 
and then I'm gonna set it aside until
tomorrow<00:04:53.800> and<00:04:54.040> finish<00:04:54.220> it<00:04:54.340> up<00:04:54.460> then<00:04:54.670> but<00:04:55.450> yeah

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
tomorrow and finish it up then but yeah

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.180 
tomorrow and finish it up then but yeah
like<00:04:55.780> I<00:04:55.840> said<00:04:55.930> basically<00:04:56.530> the<00:04:56.650> top<00:04:56.800> side<00:04:57.070> is

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
like I said basically the top side is

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.320 
like I said basically the top side is
finished<00:04:57.490> aside<00:04:57.760> from<00:04:57.910> a<00:04:58.000> few<00:04:58.180> of<00:04:58.270> those

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
finished aside from a few of those

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.880 
finished aside from a few of those
little<00:04:58.690> bits<00:04:58.810> and<00:04:59.020> pieces<00:04:59.170> and<00:04:59.350> then<00:04:59.620> I've<00:04:59.740> got

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
little bits and pieces and then I've got

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.120 
little bits and pieces and then I've got
to<00:04:59.980> do<00:05:00.070> the<00:05:00.190> underside<00:05:01.440> which<00:05:02.440> won't<00:05:02.740> even

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
to do the underside which won't even

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.480 
to do the underside which won't even
take<00:05:03.340> me<00:05:03.520> very<00:05:03.550> long<00:05:03.880> where<00:05:04.390> did<00:05:04.950> go<00:05:05.950> there<00:05:06.430> is

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
take me very long where did go there is

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.950 
take me very long where did go there is
ya<00:05:09.490> the<00:05:09.640> underside<00:05:10.920> the<00:05:11.920> devil<00:05:12.310> says<00:05:12.960> was

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
ya the underside the devil says was

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.100 
ya the underside the devil says was
pretty<00:05:14.470> thorough<00:05:15.030> they<00:05:16.030> came<00:05:16.270> with<00:05:16.540> the<00:05:16.720> model

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
pretty thorough they came with the model

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.540 
pretty thorough they came with the model
so<00:05:17.230> that's<00:05:17.350> so<00:05:17.590> I<00:05:18.010> don't<00:05:18.160> need<00:05:18.280> to<00:05:18.400> use<00:05:18.520> too

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
so that's so I don't need to use too

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.700 
so that's so I don't need to use too
many<00:05:18.880> for<00:05:19.060> the<00:05:19.150> underside<00:05:19.540> but<00:05:19.840> um<00:05:20.080> I'll

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
many for the underside but um I'll

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.090 
many for the underside but um I'll
probably<00:05:20.890> use<00:05:21.130> these<00:05:21.640> two<00:05:21.910> panels<00:05:22.330> and<00:05:23.100> this

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
probably use these two panels and this

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.540 
probably use these two panels and this
section<00:05:24.400> here<00:05:24.880> on<00:05:24.910> the<00:05:25.150> actual<00:05:25.450> ventral

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
section here on the actual ventral

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.630 
section here on the actual ventral
engineering<00:05:27.550> section<00:05:28.500> and<00:05:29.500> maybe<00:05:30.280> a<00:05:30.370> few<00:05:30.580> more

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
engineering section and maybe a few more

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.920 
engineering section and maybe a few more
little<00:05:30.940> bits<00:05:31.180> and<00:05:31.300> pieces<00:05:31.360> here<00:05:31.780> and<00:05:31.870> there

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
little bits and pieces here and there

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.440 
little bits and pieces here and there
plus<00:05:32.230> all<00:05:32.440> of<00:05:32.500> these<00:05:32.940> so<00:05:33.940> you<00:05:34.000> can<00:05:34.150> probably

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450 
plus all of these so you can probably

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.770 
plus all of these so you can probably
see<00:05:34.930> in<00:05:35.050> the<00:05:35.170> corner<00:05:35.590> there<00:05:36.510> there's<00:05:37.510> a<00:05:37.600> couple

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
see in the corner there there's a couple

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.300 
see in the corner there there's a couple
little<00:05:37.930> red<00:05:38.260> markings<00:05:38.950> and<00:05:41.100> these<00:05:42.100> little

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
little red markings and these little

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.090 
little red markings and these little
things<00:05:42.430> here<00:05:42.820> go<00:05:43.690> on<00:05:43.840> the<00:05:43.930> ends<00:05:44.260> of<00:05:44.410> the<00:05:44.650> phaser

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:45.100 
things here go on the ends of the phaser

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.450 
things here go on the ends of the phaser
arrays<00:05:46.140> plus<00:05:47.140> there's<00:05:47.380> more<00:05:47.590> the<00:05:47.740> go<00:05:47.890> around

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
arrays plus there's more the go around

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.700 
arrays plus there's more the go around
the<00:05:49.860> around<00:05:50.860> the<00:05:51.010> arrays<00:05:52.200> evenly<00:05:53.200> spaced<00:05:53.500> at

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
the around the arrays evenly spaced at

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.170 
the around the arrays evenly spaced at
equidistant<00:05:53.980> positions<00:05:54.670> and<00:05:54.910> yadda<00:05:55.090> yadda

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
equidistant positions and yadda yadda

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.770 
equidistant positions and yadda yadda
yadda<00:05:55.650> basically<00:05:56.650> just<00:05:56.830> warning<00:05:57.130> markings

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
yadda basically just warning markings

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.690 
yadda basically just warning markings
probably<00:05:58.780> just<00:05:58.990> you<00:05:59.770> know<00:05:59.890> warning<00:06:00.340> anyone

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:00.700 
probably just you know warning anyone

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.060 
probably just you know warning anyone
who<00:06:00.820> may<00:06:00.970> be<00:06:01.030> out<00:06:01.150> for<00:06:01.540> a<00:06:01.570> little<00:06:01.830> spacewalk<00:06:02.830> on

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
who may be out for a little spacewalk on

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.060 
who may be out for a little spacewalk on
the<00:06:03.280> surface<00:06:03.730> of<00:06:03.910> the<00:06:04.120> ship<00:06:04.710> don't<00:06:05.710> walk<00:06:06.040> over

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
the surface of the ship don't walk over

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.850 
the surface of the ship don't walk over
this<00:06:06.700> because<00:06:07.240> if<00:06:07.630> a<00:06:07.720> Borg<00:06:07.990> cube<00:06:08.260> attacks<00:06:08.650> you

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860 
this because if a Borg cube attacks you

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.440 
this because if a Borg cube attacks you
can<00:06:08.980> be<00:06:09.100> incinerated<00:06:09.400> when<00:06:09.880> we<00:06:09.970> fire<00:06:10.180> phasers

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.450 
can be incinerated when we fire phasers

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:17.370 
can be incinerated when we fire phasers
so<00:06:13.020> that's<00:06:14.020> just<00:06:14.170> my<00:06:14.320> wacky<00:06:14.560> speculation<00:06:16.380> but

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380 
so that's just my wacky speculation but

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.750 
so that's just my wacky speculation but
yeah<00:06:17.560> so<00:06:17.800> I'm<00:06:17.980> probably<00:06:18.160> not<00:06:18.400> even<00:06:18.460> going<00:06:18.670> to

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:18.760 
yeah so I'm probably not even going to

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.950 
yeah so I'm probably not even going to
need<00:06:18.850> to<00:06:18.970> use<00:06:19.060> a<00:06:19.090> whole<00:06:19.360> lot<00:06:19.540> more<00:06:19.720> of<00:06:19.780> these

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
need to use a whole lot more of these

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.530 
need to use a whole lot more of these
just<00:06:20.290> these<00:06:20.410> couple<00:06:20.620> ventral<00:06:21.370> bits<00:06:22.060> and<00:06:22.420> a

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:22.540 
just these couple ventral bits and a

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:23.970 
just these couple ventral bits and a
couple<00:06:22.810> on<00:06:22.930> the<00:06:23.020> bottom<00:06:23.290> of<00:06:23.350> the<00:06:23.440> saucer<00:06:23.800> and

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:23.980 
couple on the bottom of the saucer and

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.410 
couple on the bottom of the saucer and
these<00:06:24.130> a<00:06:24.160> little<00:06:24.460> warning<00:06:24.760> markings<00:06:25.120> I<00:06:25.240> can

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:25.420 
these a little warning markings I can

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.510 
these a little warning markings I can
probably<00:06:25.540> have<00:06:25.810> this<00:06:25.900> thing<00:06:26.140> finished<00:06:26.950> off<00:06:27.250> in

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
probably have this thing finished off in

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.590 
probably have this thing finished off in
like<00:06:27.700> another<00:06:27.970> hour<00:06:28.770> but<00:06:29.770> um<00:06:30.180> like<00:06:31.180> I<00:06:31.210> said<00:06:31.300> I'm

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 
like another hour but um like I said I'm

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.090 
like another hour but um like I said I'm
really<00:06:31.720> tired<00:06:32.050> and<00:06:32.260> I<00:06:32.350> gotta<00:06:32.500> work<00:06:32.710> early<00:06:33.070> so

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:33.100 
really tired and I gotta work early so

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.030 
really tired and I gotta work early so
I'm<00:06:33.820> just<00:06:34.000> gonna<00:06:34.090> leave<00:06:34.360> it<00:06:34.390> for<00:06:34.690> now<00:06:35.040> I'll

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:36.040 
I'm just gonna leave it for now I'll

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.570 
I'm just gonna leave it for now I'll
come<00:06:36.310> back<00:06:36.460> to<00:06:36.700> it<00:06:36.880> tomorrow<00:06:37.030> evening

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580 
come back to it tomorrow evening

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:45.070 
come back to it tomorrow evening
and<00:06:41.830> finish<00:06:42.830> it<00:06:42.860> off<00:06:43.039> then<00:06:43.340> and<00:06:43.930> hopefully<00:06:44.930> be

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 
and finish it off then and hopefully be

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.269 
and finish it off then and hopefully be
able<00:06:45.169> to<00:06:45.319> watch<00:06:45.469> the<00:06:45.620> hockey<00:06:45.800> game<00:06:45.919> while

00:06:46.269 --> 00:06:46.279 
able to watch the hockey game while

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:50.950
