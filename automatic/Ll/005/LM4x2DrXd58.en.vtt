00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
much drama or too much excess it's a

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.990 
much drama or too much excess it's a
very<00:02:24.560> nice<00:02:24.739> natural<00:02:25.099> looking<00:02:25.280> mascara<00:02:25.670> and<00:02:25.940> I

flexible kind of crunchy to be honest
but<00:03:04.549> if<00:03:04.640> you<00:03:04.760> wear<00:03:04.940> this<00:03:05.030> on<00:03:05.180> by<00:03:05.299> itself<00:03:05.720> it's

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
but if you wear this on by itself it's

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.750 
but if you wear this on by itself it's
very<00:03:06.319> flexible<00:03:06.709> you<00:03:06.980> just<00:03:07.250> feel<00:03:07.430> like<00:03:07.580> it's

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
very flexible you just feel like it's

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.070 
very flexible you just feel like it's
your<00:03:07.940> natural<00:03:08.090> lashes<00:03:08.599> and<00:03:08.840> you<00:03:08.930> can

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
your natural lashes and you can

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.210 
your natural lashes and you can
literally<00:03:09.319> just<00:03:09.560> touch<00:03:09.739> them<00:03:09.890> they<00:03:10.010> don't

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
literally just touch them they don't

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.710 
literally just touch them they don't
mess<00:03:10.400> up<00:03:10.430> or<00:03:10.700> anything<00:03:10.880> I<00:03:11.030> specifically<00:03:11.540> like

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
mess up or anything I specifically like

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.330 
mess up or anything I specifically like
using<00:03:11.930> this<00:03:12.170> one<00:03:12.380> on<00:03:12.560> days<00:03:12.739> I'm<00:03:12.920> just<00:03:13.099> going<00:03:13.280> to

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
using this one on days I'm just going to

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.740 
using this one on days I'm just going to
school<00:03:13.549> or<00:03:13.700> work<00:03:13.790> like<00:03:14.000> an<00:03:14.120> everyday<00:03:14.360> kind<00:03:14.599> of

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
school or work like an everyday kind of

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:15.970 
school or work like an everyday kind of
look<00:03:14.870> because<00:03:15.110> it<00:03:15.230> gives<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.530> right<00:03:15.709> amount

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
look because it gives the right amount

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.190 
look because it gives the right amount
of<00:03:16.070> length<00:03:17.000> and<00:03:17.239> volume<00:03:17.450> without<00:03:17.959> going

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
of length and volume without going

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.020 
of length and volume without going
overboard<00:03:18.500> but<00:03:18.950> it's<00:03:19.070> also<00:03:19.220> a<00:03:19.400> great<00:03:19.700> base

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
overboard but it's also a great base

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.460 
overboard but it's also a great base
when<00:03:20.299> you<00:03:20.329> want<00:03:20.570> to<00:03:20.630> put<00:03:20.810> more<00:03:20.989> voluminous

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
when you want to put more voluminous

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.229 
when you want to put more voluminous
mascara<00:03:21.859> on<00:03:22.310> top<00:03:22.340> because<00:03:22.700> it<00:03:22.940> gives<00:03:23.120> you<00:03:23.209> the

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
mascara on top because it gives you the

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.240 
mascara on top because it gives you the
length<00:03:23.540> and<00:03:23.780> flexibility<00:03:24.260> at<00:03:24.410> first<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:24.890> then

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
length and flexibility at first and then

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.710 
length and flexibility at first and then
if<00:03:25.370> you<00:03:25.459> layer<00:03:25.730> on<00:03:25.970> a<00:03:26.000> more<00:03:26.329> voluminous

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
if you layer on a more voluminous

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.289 
if you layer on a more voluminous
mascara<00:03:26.959> it<00:03:27.920> adds<00:03:28.280> more<00:03:28.609> volume<00:03:29.060> obviously

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
mascara it adds more volume obviously

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.390 
mascara it adds more volume obviously
but<00:03:29.959> it's<00:03:30.230> just<00:03:30.470> a<00:03:30.620> good<00:03:30.829> starting<00:03:31.220> base

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
but it's just a good starting base

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.640 
but it's just a good starting base
without<00:03:31.609> making<00:03:32.420> all<00:03:32.750> your<00:03:32.930> mascara<00:03:33.319> very
