00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
Vega one was made for adults so if you

check with your pediatrician first for

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.330 
check with your pediatrician first for
me<00:02:20.880> I<00:02:21.210> usually<00:02:21.540> add<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:21.870> scoop<00:02:22.350> or<00:02:22.560> even<00:02:22.800> half<00:02:23.160> a

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
me I usually add a scoop or even half a

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.800 
me I usually add a scoop or even half a
scoop<00:02:23.550> a<00:02:23.640> lot<00:02:23.760> of<00:02:23.850> times<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.360> my<00:02:24.450> smoothie

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
scoop a lot of times to my smoothie

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.570 
scoop a lot of times to my smoothie
recipes<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.740> really<00:02:25.950> depends<00:02:26.280> on<00:02:26.340> what<00:02:26.460> the

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
recipes it really depends on what the

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.550 
recipes it really depends on what the
rest<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:26.970> ingredients<00:02:27.090> are<00:02:27.630> if<00:02:28.230> I<00:02:28.440> have

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
rest of the ingredients are if I have

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.770 
rest of the ingredients are if I have
yoghurt<00:02:29.040> or<00:02:29.310> III<00:02:29.700> live<00:02:29.910> blue-green<00:02:30.360> algae

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
yoghurt or III live blue-green algae

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.710 
yoghurt or III live blue-green algae
those<00:02:31.320> are<00:02:31.470> also<00:02:31.890> high<00:02:32.160> protein<00:02:32.760> so<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.510> half

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
those are also high protein so the half

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.080 
those are also high protein so the half
scoop<00:02:33.990> helps<00:02:34.350> me<00:02:34.440> make<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.740> last<00:02:34.980> longer<00:02:35.190> and

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
scoop helps me make it last longer and

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.520 
scoop helps me make it last longer and
it<00:02:36.180> also<00:02:36.360> keeps<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.840> flavor<00:02:37.200> from

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
it also keeps the flavor from

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.980 
it also keeps the flavor from
overpowering<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.490> fresh<00:02:38.730> ingredients<00:02:38.990> and

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
overpowering the fresh ingredients and

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.170 
overpowering the fresh ingredients and
my<00:02:40.140> favorite<00:02:40.590> flavors<00:02:41.040> are<00:02:41.250> vanilla<00:02:41.850> and

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
my favorite flavors are vanilla and

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.990 
my favorite flavors are vanilla and
vanilla<00:02:42.210> ch<00:02:42.720> hi<00:02:43.130> now<00:02:44.130> if<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.520> push<00:02:44.850> yourself

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.250 
like longer than an hour or you're in
training<00:02:50.400> then<00:02:51.120> you<00:02:51.270> definitely<00:02:52.020> want<00:02:52.200> to

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
training then you definitely want to

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.530 
training then you definitely want to
consider<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.860> biggest<00:02:53.190> sport<00:02:53.550> products<00:02:53.970> they

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
consider the biggest sport products they

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.810 
consider the biggest sport products they
have<00:02:54.690> everything<00:02:55.170> that<00:02:55.350> Vega<00:02:55.739> one<00:02:56.100> has<00:02:56.370> except

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
have everything that Vega one has except

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.470 
have everything that Vega one has except
it's<00:02:56.970> 25<00:02:57.810> grams<00:02:58.290> of<00:02:58.500> protein<00:02:58.560> versus<00:02:59.310> 15<00:02:59.820> plus

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
it's 25 grams of protein versus 15 plus

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.930 
it's 25 grams of protein versus 15 plus
it<00:03:00.630> also<00:03:00.750> has<00:03:01.140> 5,000<00:03:02.070> milligrams<00:03:02.280> each<00:03:02.730> of

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
it also has 5,000 milligrams each of

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.910 
it also has 5,000 milligrams each of
branched<00:03:03.450> chain<00:03:03.660> amino<00:03:03.690> acids<00:03:04.440> and<00:03:04.650> glutamine

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
branched chain amino acids and glutamine

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.670 
branched chain amino acids and glutamine
so<00:03:05.760> for<00:03:05.940> those<00:03:06.060> of<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.270> triathletes<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.440> iron

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
so for those of you triathletes and iron

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.100 
so for those of you triathletes and iron
men<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.130> women<00:03:08.430> out<00:03:08.520> there<00:03:08.820> or<00:03:09.180> post-surgery

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
men and women out there or post-surgery

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.590 
men and women out there or post-surgery
who<00:03:10.950> need<00:03:11.130> branched<00:03:11.640> chain<00:03:11.790> amino<00:03:11.820> acids<00:03:12.450> and

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
who need branched chain amino acids and

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.050 
who need branched chain amino acids and
glutamine<00:03:12.780> for<00:03:13.230> recovery<00:03:13.860> you<00:03:14.489> will<00:03:14.520> want<00:03:14.970> to

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
glutamine for recovery you will want to

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.580 
glutamine for recovery you will want to
go<00:03:15.209> with<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.480> biggest<00:03:15.810> board<00:03:16.140> and<00:03:16.500> I

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
go with the biggest board and I

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.590 
go with the biggest board and I
recommend<00:03:17.100> going<00:03:17.280> with<00:03:17.489> a<00:03:17.520> half<00:03:17.820> serving<00:03:18.360> and

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
recommend going with a half serving and

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.660 
recommend going with a half serving and
mixing<00:03:18.900> it<00:03:18.989> into<00:03:19.110> a<00:03:19.230> smoothie<00:03:19.739> or<00:03:19.980> a<00:03:20.250> full

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
mixing it into a smoothie or a full

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.490 
mixing it into a smoothie or a full
serving<00:03:21.120> mixed<00:03:21.420> with<00:03:21.540> ice<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:22.019> coconut<00:03:22.470> water

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
serving mixed with ice and coconut water

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.009 
serving mixed with ice and coconut water
so<00:03:23.340> all<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.730> different<00:03:24.060> mega<00:03:24.269> proteins<00:03:24.810> come

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
so all the different mega proteins come

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.320 
so all the different mega proteins come
in<00:03:25.170> a<00:03:25.230> variety<00:03:25.530> of<00:03:25.769> sizes<00:03:26.070> you<00:03:26.700> can<00:03:27.180> get

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
in a variety of sizes you can get

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.170 
in a variety of sizes you can get
pouches<00:03:27.989> you<00:03:28.440> can<00:03:28.830> get<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.280> different<00:03:29.880> you<00:03:30.060> know

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
pouches you can get a different you know

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.750 
pouches you can get a different you know
twelve<00:03:30.510> servings<00:03:30.750> in<00:03:31.110> a<00:03:31.170> box<00:03:31.410> you<00:03:32.190> also<00:03:32.400> can

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
twelve servings in a box you also can

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.090 
twelve servings in a box you also can
get<00:03:32.880> small<00:03:33.360> and<00:03:33.540> large<00:03:33.750> tubs<00:03:34.230> depending<00:03:34.980> on

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
get small and large tubs depending on

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.850 
get small and large tubs depending on
which<00:03:35.519> protein<00:03:35.970> I<00:03:36.230> recommend<00:03:37.230> if<00:03:37.500> you're<00:03:37.680> not

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
which protein I recommend if you're not

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.490 
which protein I recommend if you're not
sure<00:03:38.190> which<00:03:38.519> flavor<00:03:38.880> you<00:03:39.030> like<00:03:39.330> you<00:03:39.690> can<00:03:40.019> get

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
sure which flavor you like you can get

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.090 
sure which flavor you like you can get
them<00:03:40.680> in<00:03:40.890> single<00:03:41.519> serving<00:03:41.850> sizes<00:03:42.510> and<00:03:43.200> I<00:03:43.920> would

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
them in single serving sizes and I would

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.190 
them in single serving sizes and I would
get<00:03:44.250> one<00:03:44.459> of<00:03:44.580> each<00:03:44.820> flavor<00:03:45.300> maybe<00:03:45.989> the

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
get one of each flavor maybe the

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.750 
get one of each flavor maybe the
difference<00:03:46.650> on<00:03:46.920> different<00:03:47.400> types<00:03:47.609> of

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
difference on different types of

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.240 
difference on different types of
proteins<00:03:48.239> where<00:03:48.810> you<00:03:48.900> get<00:03:49.049> when<00:03:49.200> you<00:03:49.320> like<00:03:49.590> you
