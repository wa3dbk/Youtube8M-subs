00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
starts kicking ass and that is pretty

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.659 
starts kicking ass and that is pretty
much<00:03:02.879> what<00:03:03.030> this<00:03:03.450> volume<00:03:03.840> is<00:03:04.019> is<00:03:04.290> a<00:03:04.669> pretty

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:05.669 
much what this volume is is a pretty

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:09.819 
much what this volume is is a pretty
thin<00:03:05.970> volume<00:03:06.389> but<00:03:06.599> the<00:03:06.750> rest<00:03:06.959> will<00:03:07.230> be<00:03:08.299> longer

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
thin volume but the rest will be longer

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:11.690 
thin volume but the rest will be longer
larger<00:03:10.829> this<00:03:11.129> is<00:03:11.250> just<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:11.489> little

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
larger this is just a little

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.899 
larger this is just a little
introduction<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.510> I<00:03:13.349> thoroughly<00:03:13.799> enjoyed<00:03:14.400> it

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:16.909 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:24.289 

so<00:03:17.909> if<00:03:18.299> you<00:03:20.060> like<00:03:21.349> shown<00:03:22.349> ins<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:22.879> think<00:03:23.879> you

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
so if you like shown ins I think you

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.110

is so far it looks like it's going to

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.490 
is so far it looks like it's going to
turn<00:03:52.210> out<00:03:52.270> pretty<00:03:52.450> good<00:03:52.720> this<00:03:53.140> is<00:03:53.230> just<00:03:53.380> an

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
turn out pretty good this is just an

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.110 
turn out pretty good this is just an
intro<00:03:53.800> though<00:03:53.980> so<00:03:54.190> it<00:03:54.280> can't<00:03:54.520> say<00:03:54.700> that<00:03:54.880> much

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
intro though so it can't say that much

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.250 
intro though so it can't say that much
so<00:03:56.050> and<00:03:56.910> they<00:03:57.910> are<00:03:58.090> work<00:03:58.330> I<00:03:58.630> really<00:03:58.960> like<00:03:59.080> the
