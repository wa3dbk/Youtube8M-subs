calculator in alpha mode click alpha you

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.850 
calculator in alpha mode click alpha you
see<00:00:35.489> here<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.090> calculator<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.960> in<00:00:37.469> alpha

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
see here that the calculator is in alpha

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.420 
see here that the calculator is in alpha
mode<00:00:38.100> however<00:00:39.590> as<00:00:40.590> soon<00:00:40.829> as<00:00:40.980> we<00:00:41.160> type<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
mode however as soon as we type the

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.450 
mode however as soon as we type the
letter<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:42.180> will<00:00:42.450> fall<00:00:42.840> off<00:00:43.110> alpha<00:00:43.770> mode<00:00:43.980> but

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
letter it will fall off alpha mode but

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.420 
letter it will fall off alpha mode but
if<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.730> type<00:00:44.969> alpha<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.570> second<00:00:45.960> time<00:00:46.230> now<00:00:47.129> it's

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
if I type alpha a second time now it's

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.260 
if I type alpha a second time now it's
locked

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
locked

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.560

in<00:00:48.629> alpha<00:00:49.110> mode<00:00:49.219> until<00:00:50.219> we<00:00:50.399> type<00:00:50.670> alpha<00:00:51.239> for

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
in alpha mode until we type alpha for

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.549 
in alpha mode until we type alpha for
the<00:00:51.660> third<00:00:51.930> time<00:00:53.300> this<00:00:54.300> value<00:00:54.840> let's<00:00:55.320> say<00:00:55.500> I'm

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
the third time this value let's say I'm

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:02.060 
the third time this value let's say I'm
gonna<00:00:55.739> call<00:00:56.039> V<00:00:58.640> lowercase<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.940> if<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:01.109> type<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.649> is

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
gonna call V lowercase a if I type a is

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.369 
gonna call V lowercase a if I type a is
gonna<00:01:02.370> be<00:01:02.460> an<00:01:02.670> upper<00:01:02.969> case<00:01:03.180> but<00:01:03.870> if<00:01:03.960> before

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
gonna be an upper case but if before

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.820 
gonna be an upper case but if before
that<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.949> click<00:01:05.909> on<00:01:06.060> this<00:01:06.180> key<00:01:06.500> that<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.650> a

you see it's activated here the letter a

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.080 
you see it's activated here the letter a
becomes<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.170> lowercase<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.430> we're<00:01:14.820> ready
