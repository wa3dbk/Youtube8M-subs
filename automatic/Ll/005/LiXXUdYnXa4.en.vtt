00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
perceive as being difficult patients I

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.680 
perceive as being difficult patients I
had<00:01:22.250> seen<00:01:22.460> them<00:01:22.520> in<00:01:22.580> my<00:01:22.730> chiropractic<00:01:23.270> patient

had seen them in my chiropractic patient
my<00:01:24.140> chiropractic<00:01:24.790> load<00:01:25.790> I<00:01:26.090> would<00:01:26.720> have

my chiropractic load I would have

thought these are people they're going

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.470 
thought these are people they're going
to<00:01:28.340> be<00:01:28.430> extremely<00:01:28.640> difficult<00:01:28.940> to<00:01:29.300> work<00:01:29.420> with

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
to be extremely difficult to work with

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.780 
to be extremely difficult to work with
and<00:01:29.960> we<00:01:30.530> all<00:01:30.650> have<00:01:30.890> those<00:01:31.010> patients<00:01:31.610> you<00:01:31.700> know

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
there's some composed of these kinds of

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.480 
there's some composed of these kinds of
people<00:01:41.360> but<00:01:41.780> they<00:01:42.740> have<00:01:42.890> something<00:01:43.280> that

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
people but they have something that

addresses those kinds of problems when
typically<00:01:46.190> nothing<00:01:46.610> else<00:01:46.790> will<00:01:47.210> there<00:01:47.630> are<00:01:47.900> a

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
typically nothing else will there are a

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.870 
typically nothing else will there are a
few<00:01:47.990> things<00:01:48.530> will<00:01:48.800> or<00:01:49.040> at<00:01:49.130> least<00:01:49.280> not<00:01:49.550> very

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
few things will or at least not very

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.300 
few things will or at least not very
well<00:01:50.120> I<00:01:50.390> mean<00:01:51.260> this<00:01:51.350> is<00:01:51.500> just<00:01:51.530> it's<00:01:52.010> it's<00:01:52.190> a

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
well I mean this is just it's it's a

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.270 
well I mean this is just it's it's a
real<00:01:52.490> pearl<00:01:52.820> real<00:01:53.660> pearl<00:01:53.930> I<00:01:54.200> think<00:01:55.040> if<00:01:55.160> your

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
real pearl real pearl I think if your

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.680 
real pearl real pearl I think if your
time<00:01:55.490> and<00:01:55.640> investing<00:01:56.000> it<00:01:56.090> with<00:01:56.240> us

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
time and investing it with us

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.110 
time and investing it with us
this<00:01:57.470> type<00:01:57.710> of<00:01:57.740> work<00:01:58.040> is<00:01:58.250> extremely<00:01:58.730> sensitive

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
this type of work is extremely sensitive

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.030 
this type of work is extremely sensitive
so<00:01:59.870> it's<00:02:00.050> just<00:02:00.200> not<00:02:00.409> something<00:02:00.590> that<00:02:00.800> can<00:02:00.980> be

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
so it's just not something that can be

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.950 
so it's just not something that can be
taught<00:02:01.370> in<00:02:01.520> a<00:02:01.550> weekend<00:02:01.940> course<00:02:02.180> and<00:02:02.690> there's

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
taught in a weekend course and there's

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.080 
taught in a weekend course and there's
definitely<00:02:03.680> an<00:02:03.770> art<00:02:03.950> and<00:02:04.190> there's<00:02:04.820> definitely

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
definitely an art and there's definitely

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.930 
definitely an art and there's definitely
a<00:02:05.510> science<00:02:06.020> to<00:02:06.770> treating<00:02:07.130> patients<00:02:07.610> this<00:02:07.730> way

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
a science to treating patients this way

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
FC archive site and I found that you do

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.750 
FC archive site and I found that you do
FCR<00:02:16.500> so<00:02:17.500> I<00:02:17.890> compared<00:02:18.489> the<00:02:18.940> two<00:02:19.209> and<00:02:20.160> you<00:02:21.160> know

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
FCR so I compared the two and you know

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.610 
FCR so I compared the two and you know
I'm<00:02:21.849> it's<00:02:22.000> a<00:02:22.090> neurology<00:02:22.599> and<00:02:22.900> so<00:02:23.080> are<00:02:23.230> you

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
I'm it's a neurology and so are you

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.080 
I'm it's a neurology and so are you
and<00:02:23.830> I<00:02:23.860> really<00:02:24.190> like<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.519> fact<00:02:24.700> that<00:02:24.849> it's

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
and I really like the fact that it's

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.960

start out with two days of classroom
time<00:02:33.810> then<00:02:34.810> we<00:02:34.989> move<00:02:35.170> into<00:02:35.349> the<00:02:35.500> clinic<00:02:35.860> we<00:02:36.459> see

people the patients that you are
treating<00:02:52.989> it<00:02:53.470> was<00:02:53.739> just<00:02:53.950> so<00:02:54.099> impressive<00:02:54.459> just

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
treating it was just so impressive just

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.850

as<00:02:55.150> it<00:02:55.299> felt<00:02:55.569> right<00:02:55.840> now<00:02:56.170> just<00:02:56.349> felt<00:02:56.560> like<00:02:56.650> this

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
as it felt right now just felt like this

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.030 
as it felt right now just felt like this
it's<00:02:57.760> a<00:02:57.849> great<00:02:58.000> direction<00:02:58.360> we<00:02:58.510> go<00:02:58.660> I<00:02:58.980> want<00:02:59.980> to

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
it's a great direction we go I want to

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.880 
it's a great direction we go I want to
share<00:03:00.280> FCR<00:03:01.030> with<00:03:01.239> other<00:03:01.420> doctors<00:03:01.720> I've<00:03:02.260> seen

share FCR with other doctors I've seen

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.740 
share FCR with other doctors I've seen
such<00:03:03.160> dramatic<00:03:03.400> changes<00:03:04.209> in<00:03:04.360> my<00:03:04.510> practice

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
such dramatic changes in my practice

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.020 
such dramatic changes in my practice
that<00:03:05.620> I<00:03:05.680> just<00:03:05.860> know<00:03:06.069> there's<00:03:06.280> so<00:03:06.489> many<00:03:06.579> people

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
that I just know there's so many people

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.910 
that I just know there's so many people
out<00:03:07.150> there<00:03:07.180> suffering<00:03:07.690> needlessly<00:03:08.140> and<00:03:08.799> it

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
out there suffering needlessly and it

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.190 
out there suffering needlessly and it
seems<00:03:09.190> like<00:03:09.489> this<00:03:09.790> treatment<00:03:10.480> is<00:03:10.630> the<00:03:10.810> only

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
seems like this treatment is the only

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.410 
seems like this treatment is the only
thing<00:03:11.470> that<00:03:11.769> will<00:03:11.920> fix<00:03:12.160> them<00:03:12.370> where<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.180> cause

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
thing that will fix them where the cause

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.449 
thing that will fix them where the cause
of<00:03:13.450> their<00:03:13.840> problems<00:03:13.870> seems<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:14.769> be<00:03:14.890> out<00:03:15.400> of

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
of their problems seems to be out of

of their problems seems to be out of

wobble<00:03:30.370> you<00:03:30.549> can<00:03:30.730> shake<00:03:31.060> no<00:03:31.720> tremors<00:03:32.109> but<00:03:33.040> it

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
wobble you can shake no tremors but it

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.009 
wobble you can shake no tremors but it
was<00:03:33.370> really<00:03:33.819> really<00:03:34.000> satisfied<00:03:34.600> so<00:03:34.750> not<00:03:34.870> only

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
was really really satisfied so not only

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.410 
was really really satisfied so not only
did<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.380> treatment<00:03:35.709> go<00:03:36.010> extremely<00:03:36.579> well<00:03:36.760> but

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
did the treatment go extremely well but

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.229 
did the treatment go extremely well but
great<00:03:37.810> releases<00:03:38.430> that<00:03:39.430> he<00:03:39.579> commented<00:03:40.030> I<00:03:40.180> was

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
great releases that he commented I was

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.690 
great releases that he commented I was
but<00:03:42.049> the<00:03:42.140> response<00:03:42.560> when<00:03:42.950> he<00:03:42.980> stood<00:03:43.310> him<00:03:43.549> up

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
but the response when he stood him up

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.100 
but the response when he stood him up
and<00:03:44.330> observed<00:03:45.129> is<00:03:46.129> after-effects<00:03:47.060> it<00:03:47.930> was

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
and observed is after-effects it was

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.770 
and observed is after-effects it was
just<00:03:48.500> I<00:03:48.890> think<00:03:49.610> was<00:03:49.849> the<00:03:50.030> surprise<00:03:50.390> of<00:03:50.420> him<00:03:50.659> it

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
just I think was the surprise of him it

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.990
