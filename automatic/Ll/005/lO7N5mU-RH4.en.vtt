when<00:00:06.040> I<00:00:06.070> outlined<00:00:06.670> the<00:00:06.880> new<00:00:07.030> TCR<00:00:07.509> project<00:00:07.990> one

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:08.230 
when I outlined the new TCR project one

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:09.870 
when I outlined the new TCR project one
of<00:00:08.259> the<00:00:08.380> things<00:00:08.500> that<00:00:08.889> was<00:00:09.070> not<00:00:09.309> at<00:00:09.490> the<00:00:09.580> top<00:00:09.760> of

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:09.880 
of the things that was not at the top of

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.310 
of the things that was not at the top of
our<00:00:09.910> list<00:00:10.090> was<00:00:10.330> simply<00:00:10.630> to<00:00:10.750> be<00:00:10.840> the<00:00:10.990> lightest

light<00:00:13.150> bike<00:00:13.389> the<00:00:14.019> tricky<00:00:14.440> part<00:00:14.710> is<00:00:14.830> how<00:00:15.010> do<00:00:15.070> you

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:15.220 
light bike the tricky part is how do you

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.859 
light bike the tricky part is how do you
make<00:00:15.370> a<00:00:15.400> light<00:00:15.670> bike<00:00:15.910> that<00:00:16.119> still<00:00:16.390> handles

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:16.869 
make a light bike that still handles

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:18.329 
make a light bike that still handles
well<00:00:17.050> that's<00:00:17.289> still<00:00:17.470> Sprint's<00:00:17.980> well<00:00:18.159> that

well that's the balance that very few

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:24.659 
well that's the balance that very few
people<00:00:22.810> if<00:00:23.140> anybody<00:00:23.589> outside<00:00:24.099> of<00:00:24.220> giant<00:00:24.579> have

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:24.669 
people if anybody outside of giant have

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:29.200 
people if anybody outside of giant have
been<00:00:24.789> able<00:00:24.939> to<00:00:25.029> figure<00:00:25.239> out

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.420 

the<00:00:30.109> overall<00:00:30.439> goal<00:00:30.710> of<00:00:30.740> this<00:00:30.920> product<00:00:31.340> was

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
the overall goal of this product was

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.340 
the overall goal of this product was
really<00:00:31.550> stiffness<00:00:32.090> to<00:00:32.239> weight<00:00:32.270> and<00:00:32.660> I'd<00:00:33.170> say

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
really stiffness to weight and I'd say

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.049 
really stiffness to weight and I'd say
the<00:00:33.470> overall<00:00:33.680> general<00:00:33.950> design<00:00:34.460> theme<00:00:34.760> was

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
the overall general design theme was

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.150 
the overall general design theme was
scale<00:00:35.450> up<00:00:35.630> slimmed<00:00:35.960> down<00:00:36.050> if<00:00:36.470> you<00:00:36.770> remember

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
scale up slimmed down if you remember

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.560 
scale up slimmed down if you remember
from<00:00:37.370> a<00:00:37.460> lot<00:00:37.579> of<00:00:37.670> the<00:00:37.730> previous<00:00:38.120> generations

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
from a lot of the previous generations

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.319 
from a lot of the previous generations
at<00:00:38.690> TCR<00:00:39.140> we<00:00:39.350> had<00:00:39.530> big<00:00:39.829> section<00:00:40.309> down<00:00:40.610> tubes<00:00:40.940> a

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
at TCR we had big section down tubes a

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.420 
at TCR we had big section down tubes a
lot<00:00:41.690> of<00:00:41.780> these<00:00:41.870> robust<00:00:42.290> shapes<00:00:42.559> and<00:00:42.949> we<00:00:43.250> wanted

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
lot of these robust shapes and we wanted

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.280 
lot of these robust shapes and we wanted
to<00:00:43.489> keep<00:00:43.699> that<00:00:43.970> but<00:00:44.480> we<00:00:44.600> really<00:00:44.900> wanted<00:00:45.140> to

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
to keep that but we really wanted to

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.350 
to keep that but we really wanted to
slim<00:00:45.650> down<00:00:45.680> the<00:00:45.980> overall<00:00:46.190> form<00:00:46.610> and<00:00:46.820> optimize

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
slim down the overall form and optimize

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.240 
slim down the overall form and optimize
every<00:00:47.900> tube<00:00:48.110> shape<00:00:48.379> for<00:00:48.620> what<00:00:48.769> this<00:00:48.860> bike<00:00:49.100> is

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
every tube shape for what this bike is

every tube shape for what this bike is
all<00:00:49.370> about<00:00:49.640> sprinting<00:00:50.330> climbing<00:00:51.290> and<00:00:51.500> really

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
all about sprinting climbing and really

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.320 
all about sprinting climbing and really
that<00:00:51.920> greatest<00:00:52.250> stiffness<00:00:52.610> to<00:00:52.760> weight<00:00:52.790> ratio

that greatest stiffness to weight ratio

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:59.799 
that greatest stiffness to weight ratio
that<00:00:53.540> we<00:00:53.690> could<00:00:53.930> possibly<00:00:54.140> come<00:00:54.559> up<00:00:54.680> with

things you notice about the new TCR is

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.780 
things you notice about the new TCR is
the<00:02:48.169> routing<00:02:48.379> of<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.620> rear<00:02:48.829> brake<00:02:49.040> cable<00:02:49.459> it

I<00:03:21.379> think<00:03:21.620> what<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:21.829> TCR<00:03:22.250> has<00:03:22.459> offer<00:03:22.729> is<00:03:22.939> that

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
I think what the TCR has offer is that

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.210 
I think what the TCR has offer is that
it's<00:03:23.299> it's<00:03:23.629> top<00:03:23.870> of<00:03:23.900> the<00:03:24.049> category<00:03:24.530> and<00:03:24.739> each

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
it's it's top of the category and each

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.129 
it's it's top of the category and each
of<00:03:25.370> those<00:03:25.549> incredibly<00:03:26.120> stiff<00:03:26.449> can<00:03:26.750> turn<00:03:26.959> on<00:03:27.109> a

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
of those incredibly stiff can turn on a

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:28.839 
of those incredibly stiff can turn on a
dime<00:03:27.229> with<00:03:27.590> it<00:03:27.769> so<00:03:27.949> all<00:03:28.220> around<00:03:28.489> it's<00:03:28.639> a<00:03:28.699> great

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849

it's a strong legacy that I actually

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:38.050
