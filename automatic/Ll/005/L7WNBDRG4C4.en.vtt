I'm<00:00:13.740> going<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:13.950> show<00:00:14.100> you<00:00:14.129> how<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.370> test<00:00:14.639> the

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.850 
I'm going to show you how to test the

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.210 
I'm going to show you how to test the
ignition<00:00:15.299> call<00:00:15.570> this<00:00:16.320> is<00:00:16.530> not<00:00:16.560> exactly<00:00:17.100> the

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
ignition call this is not exactly the

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.580 
ignition call this is not exactly the
way<00:00:17.400> we<00:00:17.550> do<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.820> in<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:17.940> shop<00:00:18.180> this<00:00:19.170> is<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.410> way

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
way we do it in the shop this is a way

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.410 
way we do it in the shop this is a way
that<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:20.340> can<00:00:20.490> do<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.670> at<00:00:20.789> home<00:00:20.970> for<00:00:21.210> the

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
that you can do it at home for the

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.230 
that you can do it at home for the
do-it-yourselfer<00:00:22.669> first<00:00:23.669> thing<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:24.029> want<00:00:24.210> to

we're going to pull the starter off here

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.640 
we're going to pull the starter off here
and<00:00:39.239> we're<00:00:39.360> going<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.540> unhook<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.140> kill<00:00:40.410> wire

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:40.650 
and we're going to unhook the kill wire

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.150 
and we're going to unhook the kill wire
from<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.010> ignition<00:00:41.400> pole<00:00:42.800> you<00:00:43.800> don't<00:00:43.950> want<00:00:44.100> to

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
from the ignition pole you don't want to

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.870 
from the ignition pole you don't want to
test<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.490> coal<00:00:44.700> with<00:00:44.910> your<00:00:45.180> Walker<00:00:45.420> too

all<00:01:18.390> right<00:01:18.540> now<00:01:18.690> we're<00:01:18.840> ready<00:01:18.870> to<00:01:19.230> test<00:01:19.470> it

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
all right now we're ready to test it

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.880 
all right now we're ready to test it
here<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.360> shop<00:01:21.600> we<00:01:21.870> use<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.050> fire<00:01:22.380> tester

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
here in the shop we use a fire tester

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.370 
here in the shop we use a fire tester
like<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.340> it's<00:01:24.150> got<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.480> gap<00:01:24.840> in<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.110> that's

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
like this it's got a gap in it that's

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.320 
like this it's got a gap in it that's
almost<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.920> quarter<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.340> an<00:01:26.460> inch<00:01:26.580> most<00:01:27.030> people

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
almost a quarter of an inch most people

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.840 
almost a quarter of an inch most people
don't<00:01:27.450> have<00:01:27.720> these<00:01:28.160> so<00:01:29.160> what<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.520> can<00:01:29.640> do<00:01:29.729> is

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
don't have these so what you can do is

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.960 
don't have these so what you can do is
take<00:01:30.000> an<00:01:30.180> old<00:01:30.420> plug<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.170> know<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.560> good

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
take an old plug that you know is good

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.460 
take an old plug that you know is good
push<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.180> ground<00:01:33.450> out<00:01:33.869> away<00:01:34.200> from<00:01:34.229> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
push the ground out away from the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.890 
push the ground out away from the
electrode<00:01:35.190> right<00:01:35.910> now<00:01:36.119> I've<00:01:36.300> got<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.510> little

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
electrode right now I've got a little

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.580 
electrode right now I've got a little
over<00:01:37.050> an<00:01:37.229> eighth<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.530> an<00:01:37.650> inch<00:01:37.770> gap<00:01:38.130> there<00:01:38.479> this

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
over an eighth of an inch gap there this

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.670 
over an eighth of an inch gap there this
call<00:01:40.590> should<00:01:40.860> jump<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.340> gap<00:01:42.080> it<00:01:43.080> takes<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.500> lot

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
call should jump that gap it takes a lot

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.370 
call should jump that gap it takes a lot
more<00:01:43.710> voltage<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.760> fire<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.270> plug<00:01:45.660> with<00:01:46.260> it

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
more voltage to fire this plug with it

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.320 
more voltage to fire this plug with it
with<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.830> running<00:01:47.010> so<00:01:47.430> that's<00:01:47.640> why<00:01:47.820> we<00:01:48.030> need<00:01:48.180> to

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
with it running so that's why we need to

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.160 
with it running so that's why we need to
jump<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.720> yep<00:01:48.990> right<00:01:49.259> there<00:01:50.869> that<00:01:51.869> checks

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
jump that yep right there that checks

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.810 
jump that yep right there that checks
the<00:01:52.350> reserved<00:01:52.710> voltage<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.580> ignition

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
the reserved voltage in the ignition

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:01.460 
the reserved voltage in the ignition
pole<00:01:55.670> or<00:01:56.670> hopefully<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.210> can<00:01:57.360> see<00:01:57.660> that<00:02:00.470> okay

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
pole or hopefully you can see that okay

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.969 
pole or hopefully you can see that okay
I've<00:02:02.220> got<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.430> real<00:02:02.670> good<00:02:02.700> spark<00:02:03.300> there<00:02:06.979> let's

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
I've got a real good spark there let's

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:21.610 
I've got a real good spark there let's
see<00:02:08.100> if<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.280> can<00:02:08.429> zoom<00:02:08.459> in<00:02:08.910> so<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.149> can<00:02:09.330> see<00:02:09.509> it

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.710 

okay<00:02:22.620> so<00:02:23.370> at<00:02:23.490> this<00:02:23.550> point<00:02:23.910> what<00:02:24.210> we'd<00:02:24.420> want<00:02:24.630> to

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
okay so at this point what we'd want to

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.550 
okay so at this point what we'd want to
do<00:02:24.920> is<00:02:26.030> we<00:02:27.030> know<00:02:27.210> our<00:02:27.390> coal<00:02:27.690> is<00:02:27.960> passing<00:02:28.470> our

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
do is we know our coal is passing our

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.950 
do is we know our coal is passing our
test<00:02:28.890> here<00:02:29.220> so<00:02:29.430> we<00:02:29.550> want<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.820> go<00:02:29.940> ahead<00:02:30.240> and<00:02:30.450> put

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
test here so we want to go ahead and put

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:39.590 
test here so we want to go ahead and put
the<00:02:31.200> kill<00:02:31.740> wire<00:02:32.040> back<00:02:32.340> up<00:02:38.120> go<00:02:39.120> ahead<00:02:39.240> and<00:02:39.420> put

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
the kill wire back up go ahead and put

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.200 
the kill wire back up go ahead and put
your<00:02:39.630> kill<00:02:39.990> wire<00:02:40.230> back<00:02:40.500> up<00:02:40.820> and<00:02:41.820> do<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.180> same

your kill wire back up and do the same
thing<00:02:42.870> again<00:02:44.930> this<00:02:45.930> is<00:02:46.110> going<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.410> ensure<00:02:46.860> that

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
thing again this is going to ensure that

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.680 
thing again this is going to ensure that
we<00:02:47.430> don't<00:02:47.580> have<00:02:47.820> a<00:02:47.850> problem<00:02:48.180> with<00:02:48.390> the

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
we don't have a problem with the

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:57.500 
we don't have a problem with the
ignition<00:02:49.230> switch<00:02:49.410> or<00:02:50.090> any<00:02:51.090> of<00:02:51.240> the<00:02:51.330> wine<00:02:56.480> okay

switches<00:02:58.080> on<00:02:59.780> okay<00:03:00.780> still<00:03:01.200> got<00:03:01.350> a<00:03:01.380> good<00:03:01.590> spark

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
switches on okay still got a good spark

no<00:03:03.810> spark<00:03:04.440> okay<00:03:05.040> so<00:03:05.930> everything<00:03:06.930> is<00:03:07.170> checking

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
no spark okay so everything is checking

no spark okay so everything is checking
out<00:03:07.560> good<00:03:07.830> here<00:03:08.160> there<00:03:08.850> are<00:03:09.030> some<00:03:09.300> situations

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
out good here there are some situations

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.710 
out good here there are some situations
where<00:03:10.410> if<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.220> saw<00:03:11.430> gets<00:03:11.730> really<00:03:12.030> hot<00:03:12.270> warms

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
where if the saw gets really hot warms

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.050 
where if the saw gets really hot warms
up<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.140> quits<00:03:13.500> you<00:03:13.830> could<00:03:14.640> have<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:14.820> cold

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
up and quits you could have a cold

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.590 
up and quits you could have a cold
breaking<00:03:15.540> down<00:03:16.010> if<00:03:17.010> it<00:03:17.220> does<00:03:17.400> that<00:03:17.700> soon<00:03:18.480> as

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
breaking down if it does that soon as

breaking down if it does that soon as
the<00:03:18.690> saw<00:03:18.870> dies<00:03:19.580> do<00:03:20.580> your<00:03:20.790> little<00:03:20.940> test<00:03:21.239> here<00:03:21.420> if

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
the saw dies do your little test here if

the saw dies do your little test here if
it<00:03:22.440> doesn't<00:03:22.770> fire<00:03:23.010> then<00:03:23.280> you<00:03:23.400> know<00:03:23.520> your<00:03:23.700> call

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
it doesn't fire then you know your call

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.820 
it doesn't fire then you know your call
is<00:03:24.060> probably<00:03:24.420> breaking<00:03:25.020> down<00:03:25.320> when<00:03:25.500> it's<00:03:25.650> hot

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
is probably breaking down when it's hot

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.670 
is probably breaking down when it's hot
that's<00:03:26.100> rare<00:03:26.370> but<00:03:26.400> it<00:03:26.760> does<00:03:26.790> happen<00:03:27.590> some<00:03:28.590> of

that's rare but it does happen some of

that's rare but it does happen some of
the<00:03:28.739> modern<00:03:29.130> saws<00:03:29.430> have<00:03:29.970> a<00:03:30.260> spark<00:03:31.260> advance<00:03:31.650> and

the modern saws have a spark advance and
