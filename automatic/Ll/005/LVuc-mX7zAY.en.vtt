hey guys i'm going to show you my three
thumb<00:00:03.780> i<00:00:03.929> think<00:00:04.490> so<00:00:05.490> i<00:00:05.520> have<00:00:05.750> six<00:00:06.750> rooms<00:00:07.490> with<00:00:08.490> a

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.080 
thumb i think so i have six rooms with a

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.999 
thumb i think so i have six rooms with a
sapling<00:00:10.080> dot<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.730> torch<00:00:12.030> in<00:00:12.330> it<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.530> it

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
sapling dot and a torch in it and it

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.880 
sapling dot and a torch in it and it
will<00:00:14.190> automatically<00:00:14.940> use<00:00:15.089> bone<00:00:15.540> meal<00:00:15.809> on<00:00:16.049> the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
will automatically use bone meal on the

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.050 
will automatically use bone meal on the
settling<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:18.210> grow<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:18.660> into<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:19.050> tree<00:00:19.820> then<00:00:20.820> the

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
settling to grow it into a tree then the

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.519 
settling to grow it into a tree then the
room<00:00:21.390> will<00:00:21.630> flood<00:00:21.930> with<00:00:22.170> water<00:00:22.460> and<00:00:24.289> the<00:00:25.289> tree

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
room will flood with water and the tree

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.339 
room will flood with water and the tree
is<00:00:25.590> destroyed<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.490> all<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.599> items<00:00:27.930> will<00:00:28.109> fall

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
is destroyed and all the items will fall

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.020 
is destroyed and all the items will fall
down<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:29.039> small<00:00:29.490> bowl<00:00:29.789> inside<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.980> chamber

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.030 
down in a small bowl inside the chamber

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:43.190 
down in a small bowl inside the chamber
then<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.120> will<00:00:35.300> float<00:00:36.300> down<00:00:36.660> here<00:00:37.940> and<00:00:42.200> here

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
then it will float down here and here

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.229 
then it will float down here and here
this<00:00:43.770> alligator<00:00:44.010> will<00:00:45.170> remove<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.440> saplings

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
this alligator will remove the saplings

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.779 
this alligator will remove the saplings
because<00:00:48.239> sometimes<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.930> pony<00:00:49.219> does<00:00:50.219> not<00:00:50.430> grow

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
because sometimes the pony does not grow

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.439 
because sometimes the pony does not grow
a<00:00:51.090> tree<00:00:51.600> out<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.170> Supreme<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:54.149> just

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
a tree out of the Supreme so it just

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.569 
a tree out of the Supreme so it just
sucks<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:54.899> or<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.350> unused<00:00:55.860> siblings<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
sucks in or the unused siblings in the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.849 
sucks in or the unused siblings in the
immune<00:00:56.940> system<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:58.039> the<00:00:59.039> tree<00:01:00.559> with<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.680> rest

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
immune system and the tree with the rest

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.820 
immune system and the tree with the rest
of<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.190> trees<00:01:02.510> just<00:01:03.510> following<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.710> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
of the trees just following it to the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.010 
of the trees just following it to the
soul<00:01:05.330> and<00:01:07.909> yeah<00:01:08.909> it's<00:01:09.090> possible<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.600> process

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
soul and yeah it's possible to process

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.640 
soul and yeah it's possible to process
it<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:10.439> mind<00:01:10.850> automatic<00:01:11.850> factory<00:01:12.350> so<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.439> can

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
it in mind automatic factory so you can

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.530 
it in mind automatic factory so you can
make<00:01:14.310> charcoal<00:01:15.090> how's<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.960> feel<00:01:17.240> so<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.390> only

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
make charcoal how's it feel so the only

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.370 
make charcoal how's it feel so the only
thing<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.990> need<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.799> lot<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.310> bone<00:01:20.520> meal

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
thing you need is a lot of bone meal

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.090 
thing you need is a lot of bone meal
what<00:01:22.380> I'm<00:01:22.500> planning<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.939> connect<00:01:23.939> the

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
what I'm planning to connect the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.620 
what I'm planning to connect the
skeleton<00:01:26.180> mob<00:01:27.180> track<00:01:27.799> to<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.420> use<00:01:30.420> an

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
skeleton mob track to it and use an

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.780 
skeleton mob track to it and use an
automatic<00:01:31.700> workbench<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:33.630> automatically

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
automatic workbench to automatically

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:41.120 
automatic workbench to automatically
filter<00:01:35.790> just<00:01:36.479> with<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.159> bone<00:01:38.159> me<00:01:38.810> so<00:01:39.860> it<00:01:40.860> will

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
filter just with the bone me so it will

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.490 
filter just with the bone me so it will
be<00:01:42.770> now<00:01:43.770> no<00:01:44.130> need<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.369> do<00:01:45.210> anything<00:01:45.600> manually

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
be now no need to do anything manually

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.830 
be now no need to do anything manually
so<00:01:47.490> as<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.640> can<00:01:47.820> see<00:01:48.060> just<00:01:48.890> there<00:01:49.890> with<00:01:50.840> some

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
so as you can see just there with some

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.590 
so as you can see just there with some
trees<00:01:52.170> growing<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.890> some<00:01:53.100> are<00:01:53.549> not<00:01:53.610> that's

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
trees growing and some are not that's

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.440 
trees growing and some are not that's
two<00:01:55.049> children<00:01:55.409> limitations<00:01:56.310> upon<00:01:56.640> me<00:01:56.850> it's

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
two children limitations upon me it's

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.010 
two children limitations upon me it's
not<00:01:57.659> guaranteed<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.649> tree<00:01:59.040> will<00:01:59.219> grow

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
not guaranteed that the tree will grow

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.510 
not guaranteed that the tree will grow
ok<00:02:02.020> now<00:02:02.229> I'm<00:02:02.320> going<00:02:02.380> to<00:02:02.710> show<00:02:02.740> you<00:02:02.950> how<00:02:03.340> it's

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
ok now I'm going to show you how it's

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.440 
ok now I'm going to show you how it's
done<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:06.369> guess<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.240> Redstone<00:02:07.659> Byron<00:02:09.450> i'm

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
done so guess the Redstone Byron i'm

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.089 
done so guess the Redstone Byron i'm
using<00:02:10.929> the<00:02:11.170> topic<00:02:11.709> block<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:13.860> remove<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:15.069> dirt

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
using the topic block to remove the dirt

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:20.400 
using the topic block to remove the dirt
add<00:02:15.670> settings<00:02:17.280> destroy<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.430> tree<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:19.780> so<00:02:20.140> i

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
add settings destroy the tree and so i

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.759 
add settings destroy the tree and so i
will<00:02:20.739> make<00:02:20.920> a<00:02:20.950> tutorial<00:02:21.819> video<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:23.560> show<00:02:23.739> you

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
will make a tutorial video to show you

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.059 
will make a tutorial video to show you
how<00:02:24.040> it's<00:02:24.250> done<00:02:24.720> completely<00:02:25.720> but<00:02:26.500> basically<00:02:26.920> i

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
how it's done completely but basically i

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.420 
how it's done completely but basically i
am<00:02:27.190> using<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.670> target<00:02:28.390> lock<00:02:28.569> into<00:02:28.870> educator

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
am using the target lock into educator

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.770 
am using the target lock into educator
to<00:02:30.430> make<00:02:30.580> it<00:02:30.730> as<00:02:30.879> independent<00:02:31.569> as<00:02:31.660> possible

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
to make it as independent as possible

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.850 
to make it as independent as possible
just<00:02:32.410> needs<00:02:33.040> for<00:02:33.340> me<00:02:33.549> for<00:02:33.849> now<00:02:34.500> ok<00:02:35.500> if<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:35.739> have

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
just needs for me for now ok if you have

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:43.500 
just needs for me for now ok if you have
any<00:02:36.480> questions<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:38.290> just<00:02:38.910> ask<00:02:39.910> me<00:02:40.500> see
