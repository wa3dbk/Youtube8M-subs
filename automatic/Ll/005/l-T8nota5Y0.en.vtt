00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 we connect live from the hall 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.120
 operational of the navimeteo center of 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.910
 chiavari here at the marina we are 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.910
 inside the plant with gabriele 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.750
 solar marine weather forecasters and let's see 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.160
 even the screen that gives us an idea of 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.439
 precipitation in progress and those also 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.060
 that can happen on ours 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.980
 territory then I immediately ask 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.449
 solar gabriel what will be the 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.369
 therefore forecasts for the next few hours 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.660
 also view this grade 2 alert 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.640
 what should we expect on the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.949
 territory but we are absolutely not 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.899
 outside the games we say that after the 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.790
 Yesterday's precipitation this night e 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.680
 this morning in some areas we have 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.420
 still the possibility especially in 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.890
 evening of what happens 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.899
 storm phenomena 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.239
 especially in the La Spezia area 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.739
 which could then go back up to 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.230
 unfortunately these phenomena do not 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.770
 they are easy they do not have a prediction 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.390
 easy skill accordingly and need 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.610
 absolutely keep on the whole coast 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.250
 of the east and in the maximum inland 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.480
 utmost attention more for this night 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.370
 but more tomorrow morning 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.439
 I would say that already from this evening around 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.000
 at 9 pm the first may occur 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.159
 offshore phenomena and then you could 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.360
 move inland and general 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.790
 even intense fights especially in the 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.380
 just inland back and on 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.880
 heights of the five lands 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.310
 so much seeing also the colors on the 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.770
 screen here you see a small cell 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.180
 thunderstorm that could form or 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.619
 also become larger and therefore of 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.090
 in front of the promontory of Portofino 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.280
 yes here is the evolution of these phenomena 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.280
 usually they are of maritime origin that 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.670
 they are informed by the convergence of masses 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.770
 air 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.509
 this is a small storm 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.790
 developing just off the tigullio 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.439
 this and we do not have the certainty of 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.180
 its evolution however could lead 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.009
 below coast and give rise to 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.630
 localized precipitations that are 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.970
 those then because that make us afraid 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.610
 those classic colors that we say 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.810
 we see the chest self-healing 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.979
 also the tail of the rain that is 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.600
 leaving the 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.979
 territory we are in the area of ​​val d 'yes yes 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.630
 is moving even further towards 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.399
 the exact inland one of these 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.140
 phenomena concerned precisely recco e 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.450
 the outback 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.010
 especially of the val 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.860
 fontanabuona where one should also be done 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:11.630
 seventy mm of accumulated this is 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.430
 precisely the accumulated hour that 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.950
 derived from this phenomenon is precisely 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.560
 as if dissipation is now taking place 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.050
 leading towards inland but not 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.060
 has no more for anyone for hours but 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.530
 meanwhile with the young castle images 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.690
 we have also seen how the situation 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.230
 the sky outside here is a beautiful one 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.760
 visual on the territory you said just a 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.130
 accumulated important on ours 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.750
 territory in the past few hours which it was 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.520
 even the wind situation 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.290
 especially here you have one 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.690
 privileged observation 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.540
 yes we have the station set up 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.769
 collaboration with marina chiavari e sul 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.209
 above mentioned tower we have 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.820
 about forty registered this morning 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.670
 of knots therefore about 80 kilometers per hour 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.440
 from the south east this is the wind 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.540
 generated precisely by the time from 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.600
 thunderstorm china that insisted 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.410
 on the promontory of Portofino in the hours 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.410
 it occurs past
