00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
sides this with some two to three pieces

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.170 
sides this with some two to three pieces
of<00:01:46.050> the<00:01:46.290> card<00:01:46.620> on<00:01:47.010> the<00:01:47.190> side<00:01:47.400> so<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.820> will<00:01:47.970> get

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
of the card on the side so it will get

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.350 
of the card on the side so it will get
much<00:01:48.420> harder<00:01:48.900> and<00:01:49.130> yeah<00:01:50.130> much<00:01:50.700> capable<00:01:51.270> of

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
much harder and yeah much capable of

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.400 
much harder and yeah much capable of
holding<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.840> BSB<00:01:52.110> unit<00:01:52.530> then<00:01:53.520> after<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.410> you

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
holding the BSB unit then after that you

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.930 
holding the BSB unit then after that you
gotta<00:01:56.300> after<00:01:57.300> that<00:01:57.560> you<00:01:58.560> just<00:01:58.620> fold<00:01:59.550> it<00:01:59.760> and

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
gotta after that you just fold it and

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.690 
gotta after that you just fold it and
cut<00:02:00.480> in<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.720> sides<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.740> will<00:02:01.890> be<00:02:02.130> much

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
cut in the sides so it will be much

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.050 
cut in the sides so it will be much
helpful<00:02:03.450> for<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.840> PSP<00:02:04.080> to<00:02:04.380> be<00:02:04.500> in<00:02:04.650> here<00:02:05.060> them

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
helpful for the PSP to be in here them

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.720 
helpful for the PSP to be in here them
and<00:02:06.990> then<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.980> just<00:02:09.440> fold<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.800> tape<00:02:11.460> them

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
and then you just fold it and tape them

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.890 
and then you just fold it and tape them
sides<00:02:12.360> more<00:02:12.750> so<00:02:13.710> it<00:02:13.800> will<00:02:13.920> be<00:02:14.250> much<00:02:15.180> harder<00:02:15.450> and

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
sides more so it will be much harder and

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.480 
sides more so it will be much harder and
like<00:02:16.650> stiff<00:02:17.160> for<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.880> PSP<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.450> be<00:02:18.720> in<00:02:19.080> here

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
like stiff for the PSP to be in here

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.290 
like stiff for the PSP to be in here
then<00:02:20.490> after<00:02:20.910> that<00:02:21.710> you're<00:02:22.710> done<00:02:22.770> and<00:02:23.580> that's

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
then after that you're done and that's

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.080 
then after that you're done and that's
your<00:02:24.450> own<00:02:24.750> homemade<00:02:25.740> bsp<00:02:26.280> tan<00:02:26.460> from<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.820> pair<00:02:26.970> of
