00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
removed and then there's a dirty part

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.890 
removed and then there's a dirty part
right<00:03:28.890> there<00:03:28.950> and<00:03:29.460> here's<00:03:30.300> the<00:03:30.420> clean<00:03:30.630> part

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.450 
right there and here's the clean part
now<00:03:31.080> and<00:03:32.030> it<00:03:33.030> does<00:03:33.240> work<00:03:33.540> so<00:03:34.410> you<00:03:35.100> need<00:03:35.220> to<00:03:35.280> put

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460 
now and it does work so you need to put

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.550 
now and it does work so you need to put
some<00:03:35.610> elbow<00:03:35.910> grease<00:03:35.940> in<00:03:36.300> it<00:03:36.420> and<00:03:37.050> get<00:03:37.290> it<00:03:37.380> done

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
some elbow grease in it and get it done

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.490 
some elbow grease in it and get it done
as<00:03:38.490> you<00:03:38.640> can<00:03:38.790> see<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.090> tire<00:03:39.360> is<00:03:39.660> already<00:03:40.140> much

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
as you can see the tire is already much

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.200 
as you can see the tire is already much
cleaner<00:03:40.980> than<00:03:41.220> before<00:03:41.580> I'm<00:03:41.850> just<00:03:42.000> going<00:03:42.120> to

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.210 
cleaner than before I'm just going to

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.420 
cleaner than before I'm just going to
wipe<00:03:42.390> it<00:03:42.600> down<00:03:44.270> then<00:03:45.270> I'm<00:03:45.390> going<00:03:45.600> to<00:03:45.690> use<00:03:45.960> the

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
wipe it down then I'm going to use the

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.920 
wipe it down then I'm going to use the
shiner<00:03:47.600> the<00:03:48.600> shining<00:03:49.110> thing<00:03:50.360> to<00:03:51.360> make<00:03:51.570> it<00:03:51.750> even

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
shiner the shining thing to make it even

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.539 
shiner the shining thing to make it even
shinier

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.920 

now<00:03:58.549> I<00:03:58.579> didn't<00:03:58.819> get<00:03:58.909> into<00:03:59.329> all<00:03:59.510> the<00:03:59.689> crevices

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
now I didn't get into all the crevices

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.539 
now I didn't get into all the crevices
and<00:04:00.290> stuff<00:04:00.650> because<00:04:00.769> it's<00:04:01.219> going<00:04:01.340> to<00:04:01.400> take<00:04:01.519> a

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
and stuff because it's going to take a

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.369 
and stuff because it's going to take a
long<00:04:01.819> time<00:04:02.090> what<00:04:02.359> you<00:04:02.450> can<00:04:02.599> do<00:04:02.719> also<00:04:02.930> is<00:04:03.230> just

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 
long time what you can do also is just

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:05.739 
long time what you can do also is just
take<00:04:03.560> out<00:04:03.709> the<00:04:03.829> whole<00:04:03.980> rim<00:04:04.310> and<00:04:04.579> do<00:04:05.420> it<00:04:05.540> that
