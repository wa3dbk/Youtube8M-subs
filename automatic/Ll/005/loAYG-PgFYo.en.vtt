00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.060 

I<00:00:43.180> moved<00:00:44.280> queen<00:00:45.280> to<00:00:45.520> g7<00:00:46.320> but<00:00:47.320> i<00:00:47.530> think<00:00:47.590> i<00:00:47.920> could

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
I moved queen to g7 but i think i could

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.910 
I moved queen to g7 but i think i could
have<00:00:48.190> plays<00:00:49.230> Queen<00:00:50.230> to<00:00:50.410> h5<00:00:50.830> 2<00:00:51.809> i'm<00:00:52.830> looking<00:00:53.830> at

have plays Queen to h5 2 i'm looking at

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.680

maybe<00:00:54.160> I<00:00:54.370> pushed<00:00:54.820> on<00:00:55.180> f4

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
maybe I pushed on f4

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.810 
maybe I pushed on f4
instead

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.479 

with<00:01:01.329> Queen<00:01:01.660> g7<00:01:02.320> I'm<00:01:02.710> leaving<00:01:03.010> the<00:01:03.070> Queen<00:01:03.280> on

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
with Queen g7 I'm leaving the Queen on

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.460 
with Queen g7 I'm leaving the Queen on
the<00:01:03.520> on<00:01:04.000> the<00:01:04.059> diagonal<00:01:04.659> of<00:01:04.809> the<00:01:04.870> bishop<00:01:05.320> and

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
the on the diagonal of the bishop and

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.750 
the on the diagonal of the bishop and
that<00:01:06.070> could<00:01:06.250> be<00:01:06.280> a<00:01:06.370> problem<00:01:06.520> later<00:01:08.460> but<00:01:09.460> I

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
that could be a problem later but I

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.850 
that could be a problem later but I
don't<00:01:09.850> think<00:01:10.120> it's<00:01:10.330> much<00:01:10.690> worse<00:01:10.960> than<00:01:11.020> Queen

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
don't think it's much worse than Queen

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.510 
don't think it's much worse than Queen
h6

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.780 

okay<00:01:15.520> and<00:01:15.850> white<00:01:16.479> plate<00:01:16.840> efore

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.150 

and<00:01:21.120> now<00:01:21.510> for<00:01:21.570> black<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.530> don't<00:01:22.800> think<00:01:22.890> it's

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.160 
and now for black I don't think it's

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.080 
and now for black I don't think it's
very<00:01:23.190> good<00:01:23.460> from<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.760> trade-off<00:01:24.150> for<00:01:24.480> black

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
very good from the trade-off for black

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:35.770 
very good from the trade-off for black
because<00:01:29.300> few<00:01:30.300> trades<00:01:33.050> white<00:01:34.050> just<00:01:34.350> still<00:01:34.650> has

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
because few trades white just still has

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.430 
because few trades white just still has
lots<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:37.020> space<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.210> the<00:01:39.210> Ponte<00:01:39.630> six<00:01:39.990> it's

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
lots of space and and the Ponte six it's

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.790 
lots of space and and the Ponte six it's
in<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.490> way<00:01:41.640> here<00:01:42.050> my<00:01:43.050> bishop<00:01:43.410> can't<00:01:43.620> get

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
in the way here my bishop can't get

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.020 
in the way here my bishop can't get
outand<00:01:45.800> and<00:01:46.800> it<00:01:47.190> doesn't<00:01:47.520> look<00:01:47.580> very<00:01:47.640> good<00:01:47.880> for

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
outand and it doesn't look very good for

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:55.300 
outand and it doesn't look very good for
me<00:01:48.330> so<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:51.620> was<00:01:52.620> hoping<00:01:53.009> instead<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.670> maybe

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
me so I was hoping instead that maybe

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.030 
me so I was hoping instead that maybe
maybe<00:01:56.310> white<00:01:56.640> would<00:01:56.820> exchange<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.660> then<00:01:58.040> d6

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
maybe white would exchange and then d6

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.830 
maybe white would exchange and then d6
pond<00:01:59.280> get<00:01:59.550> away<00:01:59.729> maybe<00:02:00.030> what<00:02:00.240> Bishop<00:02:00.390> can<00:02:00.690> get

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:01.000 
plate I play to see six but I think f4
would<00:02:53.190> have<00:02:53.280> been<00:02:53.430> better<00:02:53.580> here

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.649 

so<00:03:01.760> II<00:03:02.090> for<00:03:02.569> and<00:03:03.080> see<00:03:03.500> six<00:03:05.019> and<00:03:06.019> a<00:03:06.319> four<00:03:06.439> I

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:07.659 
so II for and see six and a four I

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:10.089 
so II for and see six and a four I
didn't<00:03:08.659> really<00:03:08.870> know<00:03:09.140> what<00:03:09.319> this<00:03:09.470> is<00:03:09.650> doing<00:03:09.890> I

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
didn't really know what this is doing I

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.030 
didn't really know what this is doing I
guess<00:03:10.310> he<00:03:11.090> wanted<00:03:11.439> the<00:03:12.439> night<00:03:12.470> to<00:03:12.650> move<00:03:12.920> away

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
guess he wanted the night to move away

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.860 
guess he wanted the night to move away
so<00:03:13.220> that<00:03:13.400> should<00:03:13.670> have<00:03:13.790> more<00:03:13.939> pressure<00:03:14.209> on<00:03:14.390> d5

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
so that should have more pressure on d5

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.050 
so that should have more pressure on d5
and<00:03:16.659> he<00:03:17.659> did<00:03:17.840> exchange<00:03:18.079> there<00:03:18.670> after<00:03:19.670> I<00:03:19.700> moved

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
and he did exchange there after I moved

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.280 
and he did exchange there after I moved
tonight<00:03:20.780> on<00:03:21.049> the<00:03:21.140> next<00:03:21.260> month

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
tonight on the next month

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.550 
tonight on the next month
I<00:03:22.409> played<00:03:23.099> 97<00:03:23.790> I<00:03:23.879> think<00:03:24.090> again<00:03:24.390> again<00:03:25.230> I<00:03:25.379> can

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
I played 97 I think again again I can

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.039 
I played 97 I think again again I can
probably<00:03:25.739> play<00:03:26.069> off<00:03:26.250> for<00:03:26.519> here<00:03:26.810> might<00:03:27.810> be<00:03:27.840> a

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
probably play off for here might be a

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.140 
probably play off for here might be a
good<00:03:28.290> idea

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:38.240 

but<00:03:31.540> I<00:03:31.569> play<00:03:31.870> 97

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.750 

two<00:03:38.460> plates<00:03:38.700> you<00:03:39.000> tasty<00:03:39.570> five

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
two plates you tasty five

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.220 
two plates you tasty five
and<00:03:42.060> I<00:03:42.360> played<00:03:42.629> a<00:03:43.080> bad<00:03:43.650> move<00:03:43.950> I<00:03:44.250> think<00:03:44.549> like<00:03:45.950> 295

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
and I played a bad move I think like 295

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.670 
and I played a bad move I think like 295
i<00:03:48.319> take<00:03:48.860> c<00:03:49.129> 5<00:03:49.370> I<00:03:49.700> don't<00:03:49.909> think<00:03:50.090> it's<00:03:50.180> very<00:03:50.269> good

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
i take c 5 I don't think it's very good

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.440 
i take c 5 I don't think it's very good
because<00:03:51.680> it<00:03:52.099> loose<00:03:52.400> upon<00:03:52.610> right<00:03:52.940> away<00:03:53.180> but

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
because it loose upon right away but

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.470 
because it loose upon right away but
more<00:03:54.170> than<00:03:54.290> that<00:03:54.610> well<00:03:55.610> I<00:03:55.849> don't<00:03:55.970> know<00:03:56.150> as<00:03:56.420> much

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
more than that well I don't know as much

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.309 
more than that well I don't know as much

advantage

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
advantage

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.759 
advantage
so<00:04:15.830> instead<00:04:16.310> of<00:04:16.720> nine<00:04:17.720> takes<00:04:17.989> d5<00:04:18.350> maybe<00:04:18.650> I

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
so instead of nine takes d5 maybe I

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.330 
so instead of nine takes d5 maybe I
should<00:04:18.920> just<00:04:20.320> capture<00:04:21.320> hair<00:04:21.560> and<00:04:21.739> maybe<00:04:21.890> maybe

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
should just capture hair and maybe maybe

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.370
