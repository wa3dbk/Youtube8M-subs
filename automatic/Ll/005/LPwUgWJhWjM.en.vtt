in<00:00:04.910> this<00:00:05.149> video<00:00:05.480> I'm<00:00:05.600> going<00:00:05.779> to<00:00:05.990> better

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:06.319 
in this video I'm going to better

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:09.220 
in this video I'm going to better
explain<00:00:06.830> how<00:00:07.069> to<00:00:07.130> dimension<00:00:07.759> and<00:00:08.080> pick<00:00:09.080> the

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:09.230 
explain how to dimension and pick the

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.420 
explain how to dimension and pick the
steel<00:00:09.559> for<00:00:10.010> your<00:00:10.190> cutter<00:00:11.619> the<00:00:12.619> length<00:00:12.949> of<00:00:13.279> the

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:13.430 
steel for your cutter the length of the

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.240 
steel for your cutter the length of the
cutter<00:00:13.670> is<00:00:14.299> determined<00:00:15.049> by<00:00:15.199> the<00:00:15.260> diameter<00:00:15.619> of

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
cutter is determined by the diameter of

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.480 
cutter is determined by the diameter of
your<00:00:16.279> tap<00:00:16.699> style<00:00:17.119> so<00:00:17.930> for<00:00:18.170> my<00:00:18.320> tap<00:00:19.100> the

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
your tap style so for my tap the

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.599 
your tap style so for my tap the
diameter<00:00:20.210> is<00:00:20.359> three-quarters<00:00:21.109> of<00:00:21.140> an<00:00:21.380> inch<00:00:21.609> so

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
diameter is three-quarters of an inch so

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.540 
diameter is three-quarters of an inch so
I<00:00:22.669> made<00:00:22.939> my<00:00:23.150> cutter<00:00:23.900> a<00:00:24.019> total<00:00:24.949> length<00:00:25.160> of<00:00:25.369> about

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
I made my cutter a total length of about

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.509 
I made my cutter a total length of about
1/16<00:00:26.150> less<00:00:26.480> than<00:00:26.810> that<00:00:26.960> you<00:00:27.919> want<00:00:28.160> the<00:00:28.310> cutter

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 
1/16 less than that you want the cutter

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:30.339 
1/16 less than that you want the cutter
as<00:00:28.820> long<00:00:29.029> as<00:00:29.210> you<00:00:29.300> can<00:00:29.480> get<00:00:29.689> it<00:00:29.839> without

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
as long as you can get it without

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.540 
as long as you can get it without
sticking<00:00:31.220> past<00:00:31.699> the<00:00:32.360> sides<00:00:32.630> of<00:00:32.930> the<00:00:33.140> dowel

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
sticking past the sides of the dowel

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.420 
sticking past the sides of the dowel
otherwise<00:00:34.550> when<00:00:35.510> you're<00:00:35.720> starting<00:00:36.350> to<00:00:36.560> tap<00:00:37.400> a

the back of the cutter sticking out and

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.240 
the back of the cutter sticking out and
scraping<00:00:46.550> inside<00:00:46.910> the<00:00:47.090> hole<00:00:47.270> you're<00:00:47.450> tapping

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
scraping inside the hole you're tapping

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.640 
scraping inside the hole you're tapping
the<00:00:49.250> width<00:00:49.640> of<00:00:49.880> the<00:00:50.360> cutter<00:00:50.600> is<00:00:50.840> determined<00:00:51.470> by

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
the width of the cutter is determined by

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.280 
the width of the cutter is determined by
the<00:00:51.710> number<00:00:51.950> of<00:00:52.130> teeth<00:00:52.460> per<00:00:52.730> inch<00:00:52.760> you<00:00:53.000> have<00:00:53.290> so

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
the number of teeth per inch you have so

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.310 
the number of teeth per inch you have so
basically<00:00:54.860> if<00:00:55.400> you<00:00:55.580> look<00:00:55.760> at<00:00:55.910> your<00:00:56.060> tap<00:00:56.330> the

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
basically if you look at your tap the

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.190 
basically if you look at your tap the
distance<00:00:57.770> between<00:00:58.040> the<00:00:58.460> kerfs<00:00:58.760> and<00:00:59.750> for<00:01:00.050> my

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.200 
distance between the kerfs and for my

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.530 
distance between the kerfs and for my
four<00:01:00.740> tooth<00:01:00.950> per<00:01:01.160> inch<00:01:01.340> tap<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:01.910> distance<00:01:02.330> is

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
four tooth per inch tap the distance is

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.800 
four tooth per inch tap the distance is
1/4<00:01:02.990> event<00:01:03.290> a<00:01:03.560> quarter<00:01:04.400> of<00:01:04.489> an<00:01:04.580> inch<00:01:04.729> so<00:01:05.600> that

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
1/4 event a quarter of an inch so that

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.319 
1/4 event a quarter of an inch so that
was<00:01:06.049> the<00:01:06.350> width<00:01:06.680> of<00:01:06.920> my<00:01:06.979> cutter<00:01:07.460> if<00:01:07.999> you<00:01:08.179> look

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:08.329 
was the width of my cutter if you look

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:10.300 
was the width of my cutter if you look
back<00:01:08.539> at<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:08.899> first<00:01:09.140> part<00:01:09.409> in<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:09.679> series<00:01:09.920> I

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
back at the first part in the series I

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.959 
back at the first part in the series I
explained<00:01:10.850> how<00:01:11.390> to<00:01:11.829> dimension<00:01:12.829> and<00:01:13.009> pick<00:01:13.789> the

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:13.969 
explained how to dimension and pick the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:15.669 
explained how to dimension and pick the
number<00:01:14.270> of<00:01:14.390> teeth<00:01:14.630> per<00:01:14.810> inch<00:01:14.840> you<00:01:15.140> want<00:01:15.320> for

00:01:15.669 --> 00:01:15.679 
number of teeth per inch you want for

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:18.730 
number of teeth per inch you want for
your<00:01:15.799> tap<00:01:16.039> and<00:01:16.450> how<00:01:17.450> to<00:01:17.590> dimension<00:01:18.590> the

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
your tap and how to dimension the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.469 
your tap and how to dimension the
diameter<00:01:18.950> of<00:01:19.729> your<00:01:19.899> tap<00:01:20.899> as<00:01:21.170> well<00:01:22.479> the

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
diameter of your tap as well the

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.109 
diameter of your tap as well the
thickness<00:01:24.079> of<00:01:24.259> the<00:01:24.829> steel<00:01:25.130> that<00:01:25.399> you<00:01:25.549> use<00:01:25.850> for

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
thickness of the steel that you use for

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.289 
thickness of the steel that you use for
your<00:01:26.179> cutter<00:01:26.600> is<00:01:27.069> not<00:01:28.069> as<00:01:28.280> relevant<00:01:28.640> as<00:01:28.999> these

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
your cutter is not as relevant as these

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.550 
your cutter is not as relevant as these
dimensions<00:01:29.929> are<00:01:30.079> I<00:01:30.490> would<00:01:31.490> not<00:01:31.670> go<00:01:32.289> too<00:01:33.289> far

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
dimensions are I would not go too far

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.830 
dimensions are I would not go too far
under<00:01:33.950> 1/8<00:01:34.219> of<00:01:34.399> an<00:01:34.549> inch<00:01:34.639> thick<00:01:34.789> just<00:01:35.479> because

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
under 1/8 of an inch thick just because

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.679 
under 1/8 of an inch thick just because
the<00:01:36.159> cutter<00:01:37.159> could<00:01:37.429> vibrate<00:01:37.639> during<00:01:38.359> the<00:01:38.479> cut

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
the cutter could vibrate during the cut

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:44.020 
the cutter could vibrate during the cut
and<00:01:39.340> since<00:01:40.340> most<00:01:40.939> of<00:01:41.270> the<00:01:41.509> tapping<00:01:42.020> is<00:01:43.030> cutting

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
and since most of the tapping is cutting

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.840 
and since most of the tapping is cutting
on<00:01:44.210> end<00:01:44.749> grain<00:01:45.020> on<00:01:45.499> short<00:01:45.829> grain<00:01:46.100> there's<00:01:46.759> a

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
on end grain on short grain there's a

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.699 
on end grain on short grain there's a
lot<00:01:47.060> of<00:01:47.209> pressure<00:01:47.479> so<00:01:48.020> I'm<00:01:48.170> sure<00:01:48.380> if<00:01:48.530> you<00:01:48.679> use

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:48.709 
lot of pressure so I'm sure if you use

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:50.949 
lot of pressure so I'm sure if you use
thinner<00:01:49.159> steel<00:01:49.520> than<00:01:49.789> 1/8<00:01:50.090> of<00:01:50.299> an<00:01:50.420> inch

00:01:50.949 --> 00:01:50.959 
thinner steel than 1/8 of an inch

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:54.069 
thinner steel than 1/8 of an inch
it<00:01:51.590> might<00:01:51.859> chatter<00:01:52.189> a<00:01:52.340> little<00:01:52.549> more<00:01:52.990> but<00:01:53.990> you

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
it might chatter a little more but you

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.179 
it might chatter a little more but you
don't<00:01:54.229> really<00:01:54.380> need<00:01:54.590> to<00:01:54.709> go<00:01:54.799> any<00:01:54.920> higher<00:01:55.009> than

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
don't really need to go any higher than

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.309 
don't really need to go any higher than
an<00:01:55.579> eighth<00:01:55.759> of<00:01:55.909> an<00:01:56.060> inch<00:01:56.179> if<00:01:56.719> you're<00:01:56.899> doing<00:01:57.139> a

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
an eighth of an inch if you're doing a

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.399 
an eighth of an inch if you're doing a
tap<00:01:57.560> that's<00:01:57.799> much<00:01:58.009> larger<00:01:58.280> maybe<00:01:58.700> a<00:01:59.409> four-inch

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
tap that's much larger maybe a four-inch

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.419 
tap that's much larger maybe a four-inch
diameter<00:02:01.219> or<00:02:02.770> something<00:02:03.770> like<00:02:03.859> over<00:02:04.039> one

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
diameter or something like over one

diameter or something like over one
tooth<00:02:04.670> branch<00:02:05.060> you<00:02:05.990> might<00:02:06.229> want<00:02:06.499> to<00:02:06.619> use

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
tooth branch you might want to use

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:09.730 
tooth branch you might want to use
thicker<00:02:07.880> steel<00:02:08.090> but<00:02:08.780> you<00:02:08.869> don't<00:02:09.050> need<00:02:09.259> to<00:02:09.440> for

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
thicker steel but you don't need to for

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.670 
thicker steel but you don't need to for
most<00:02:10.870> wooden<00:02:11.870> screws<00:02:12.140> that<00:02:12.290> you'll<00:02:12.409> probably

I've<00:02:22.040> drawn<00:02:22.489> that<00:02:22.730> bevel<00:02:23.180> on<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.900> cutter<00:02:24.140> as

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
I've drawn that bevel on the cutter as

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.550 
I've drawn that bevel on the cutter as
well<00:02:24.590> which<00:02:25.130> is<00:02:25.370> that<00:02:25.849> 15<00:02:26.390> degrees<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:27.349> had

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
well which is that 15 degrees that had

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.510 
well which is that 15 degrees that had
shown<00:02:27.830> in<00:02:28.489> part<00:02:28.910> four<00:02:29.770> if<00:02:30.770> you<00:02:31.010> do<00:02:31.220> use<00:02:31.489> a

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
shown in part four if you do use a

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.350 
shown in part four if you do use a
thicker<00:02:31.940> steel<00:02:32.440> to<00:02:33.440> make<00:02:33.470> your<00:02:33.800> cutter<00:02:34.069> with

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
thicker steel to make your cutter with

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.180 
thicker steel to make your cutter with
like<00:02:35.360> radically<00:02:35.900> thicker<00:02:36.170> like<00:02:36.800> if<00:02:36.950> it<00:02:37.099> was

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
like radically thicker like if it was

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.100 
like radically thicker like if it was
maybe<00:02:37.970> that<00:02:38.209> thick<00:02:38.560> you<00:02:39.560> may<00:02:39.769> need<00:02:39.980> to<00:02:40.190> use<00:02:40.430> a

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
maybe that thick you may need to use a

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.040 
maybe that thick you may need to use a
sharper<00:02:42.110> angle<00:02:42.590> otherwise<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.940> back<00:02:44.209> of<00:02:44.510> the

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
sharper angle otherwise the back of the

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.500 
sharper angle otherwise the back of the
cutter<00:02:45.290> might<00:02:46.040> dig<00:02:46.340> into<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:46.940> wall<00:02:47.150> of<00:02:47.330> the

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
cutter might dig into the wall of the

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.990 
cutter might dig into the wall of the
nut<00:02:47.690> into<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.319> inside<00:02:48.650> of<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:48.950> nut<00:02:49.160> so<00:02:49.880> that's

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
nut into the inside of the nut so that's

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.780 
nut into the inside of the nut so that's
really<00:02:50.420> all<00:02:50.690> that<00:02:50.720> bevel<00:02:51.350> is<00:02:51.500> for<00:02:51.830> is<00:02:52.010> just<00:02:52.670> to

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
really all that bevel is for is just to

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.640 
really all that bevel is for is just to
relieve<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.330> back<00:02:53.510> of<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.840> cutter<00:02:54.049> from

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
relieve the back of the cutter from

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.460 
relieve the back of the cutter from
digging<00:02:55.069> into<00:02:55.840> into<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:56.959> inside<00:02:57.319> of<00:02:57.470> the<00:02:57.590> nut

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
digging into into the inside of the nut

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.839 
digging into into the inside of the nut
here's<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:00.680> cutter<00:03:00.890> that<00:03:01.250> I've<00:03:01.370> just<00:03:01.610> made

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
here's the cutter that I've just made

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:05.589 
here's the cutter that I've just made
this<00:03:02.810> is<00:03:03.049> a<00:03:03.080> cutter<00:03:03.410> that<00:03:04.280> I<00:03:04.310> made<00:03:04.910> before<00:03:05.060> for

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
this is a cutter that I made before for

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.309 
this is a cutter that I made before for
a<00:03:05.630> two<00:03:05.900> tooth<00:03:06.140> branch<00:03:06.530> tap<00:03:07.540> so<00:03:08.540> if<00:03:08.780> you<00:03:08.930> do<00:03:09.049> plan

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
a two tooth branch tap so if you do plan

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.570 
a two tooth branch tap so if you do plan
on<00:03:09.349> making<00:03:09.530> more<00:03:10.489> than<00:03:10.730> one<00:03:11.569> tap<00:03:12.280> either<00:03:13.280> ones

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
on making more than one tap either ones

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.089 
on making more than one tap either ones
of<00:03:13.760> different<00:03:14.120> diameters<00:03:14.630> or<00:03:15.099> different

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
of different diameters or different

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:17.920 
of different diameters or different
numbers<00:03:16.340> of<00:03:16.370> teeth<00:03:16.670> per<00:03:16.849> inch<00:03:16.880> you<00:03:17.569> will<00:03:17.750> have

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
numbers of teeth per inch you will have

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.990 
numbers of teeth per inch you will have
to<00:03:18.080> make<00:03:18.260> simpler<00:03:18.769> cutters<00:03:19.099> for<00:03:19.400> each<00:03:19.640> tap

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
to make simpler cutters for each tap

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.410 
to make simpler cutters for each tap
because<00:03:20.630> the<00:03:20.959> length<00:03:21.200> of<00:03:21.590> the<00:03:21.859> cutter<00:03:22.070> is

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
because the length of the cutter is

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.000 
because the length of the cutter is
custom<00:03:23.420> to<00:03:23.630> the<00:03:23.780> diameter<00:03:24.230> of<00:03:24.260> the<00:03:24.440> dowel<00:03:24.620> and

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
custom to the diameter of the dowel and

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.580 
custom to the diameter of the dowel and
the<00:03:25.730> width<00:03:25.970> is<00:03:26.209> custom<00:03:27.019> to<00:03:27.140> the<00:03:27.260> number<00:03:27.500> of

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
the width is custom to the number of

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.220 
the width is custom to the number of
teeth<00:03:27.829> per<00:03:28.040> inch<00:03:28.070> that<00:03:28.430> you<00:03:28.489> have<00:03:29.230> when

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
teeth per inch that you have when

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.410 
teeth per inch that you have when
picking<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:30.769> steel<00:03:31.070> for<00:03:31.370> your<00:03:31.519> cutter<00:03:31.760> it

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
picking the steel for your cutter it

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.150 
picking the steel for your cutter it
doesn't<00:03:32.810> have<00:03:32.959> to<00:03:33.109> be<00:03:33.260> tool<00:03:33.530> steel<00:03:33.829> like<00:03:33.980> I

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
doesn't have to be tool steel like I

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.520 
doesn't have to be tool steel like I
used<00:03:34.459> for<00:03:34.760> this<00:03:34.850> one<00:03:35.120> you<00:03:35.750> can<00:03:36.019> use<00:03:36.049> an<00:03:36.410> old

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
used for this one you can use an old

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.830 
used for this one you can use an old
file<00:03:36.950> which<00:03:37.489> is<00:03:37.670> what<00:03:37.819> I<00:03:37.850> use<00:03:38.120> for<00:03:38.150> this<00:03:38.540> cutter

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
file which is what I use for this cutter

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.080 
file which is what I use for this cutter
it's<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:39.590> only<00:03:39.739> downside<00:03:40.280> to<00:03:40.459> using<00:03:40.519> a<00:03:40.790> file

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
it's the only downside to using a file

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.240 
it's the only downside to using a file
is<00:03:41.510> that<00:03:41.720> you<00:03:41.810> have<00:03:41.930> to<00:03:42.079> soften<00:03:42.350> it<00:03:42.560> beforehand

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
is that you have to soften it beforehand

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.330 
is that you have to soften it beforehand
and<00:03:43.489> you<00:03:44.390> have<00:03:44.510> to<00:03:44.660> use<00:03:44.780> a<00:03:44.810> coarse<00:03:45.340> sharpening

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
and you have to use a coarse sharpening

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.670 
and you have to use a coarse sharpening
stone<00:03:46.670> to<00:03:47.209> get<00:03:47.389> rid<00:03:47.569> of<00:03:47.660> the<00:03:47.780> file<00:03:48.049> marks<00:03:48.470> on

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
stone to get rid of the file marks on

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.250 
stone to get rid of the file marks on
the<00:03:48.799> cutting<00:03:49.160> face<00:03:49.690> when<00:03:50.690> picking<00:03:51.079> the

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
the cutting face when picking the

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.229 
the cutting face when picking the
material<00:03:51.769> for<00:03:52.130> your<00:03:52.190> cutter<00:03:52.609> it's<00:03:53.060> not

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
material for your cutter it's not

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.240 
material for your cutter it's not
necessary<00:03:53.900> to<00:03:54.170> use<00:03:54.290> tool<00:03:54.590> steel<00:03:54.859> like<00:03:55.040> I<00:03:55.160> just

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
necessary to use tool steel like I just

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.849 
necessary to use tool steel like I just
did<00:03:55.639> using<00:03:56.329> an<00:03:56.630> old<00:03:56.810> file<00:03:57.049> will<00:03:57.350> hold<00:03:57.650> edge

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
did using an old file will hold edge

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:00.819 
did using an old file will hold edge
just<00:03:58.459> as<00:03:58.730> well<00:03:59.000> I've<00:03:59.630> used<00:04:00.049> this<00:04:00.290> cutter<00:04:00.590> which

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
just as well I've used this cutter which

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:03.400 
just as well I've used this cutter which
was<00:04:01.010> made<00:04:01.190> from<00:04:01.400> an<00:04:01.519> old<00:04:01.639> file<00:04:02.109> do<00:04:03.109> you<00:04:03.200> cut

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
was made from an old file do you cut

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.920 
was made from an old file do you cut
through<00:04:03.620> hard<00:04:03.920> maple<00:04:04.160> about<00:04:05.150> four<00:04:05.510> inches

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
through hard maple about four inches

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.009 
through hard maple about four inches
thick<00:04:06.290> and<00:04:07.120> it<00:04:08.120> could<00:04:08.329> still<00:04:08.600> probably<00:04:08.870> have

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
thick and it could still probably have

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:10.990 
thick and it could still probably have
tapped<00:04:09.380> another<00:04:09.709> nut<00:04:09.950> though<00:04:10.430> I<00:04:10.459> do<00:04:10.609> usually

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
tapped another nut though I do usually
