00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 good morning friends subscribers 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:08.820
 youtube on this side we have the xperia z 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:12.110
 And in this video we're going to talk about 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.110
 what is it about 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.490
 I'm going to show you the xperia zl but 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.080
 as it is already a video of the fair 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.600
 z what I'm going to show you is 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.109
 basically the differences here I could 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.720
 I do not know how to get a z sphere and here 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.899
 I have the zl basically inside they are 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.930
 the same cell phones exactly the same 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.510
 the camera is the same but in what 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.649
 difference one device to the other that 's 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.270
 what I am going to show here and 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.730
 basically what differs is the 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.770
 design as you can see if the 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.570
 camera allows me in both colors 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.309
 not pay attention to the colors as 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.770
 each of the devices come in 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.989
 different colors in what is 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.899
 difference is the design has a design 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.969
 totally different as you can see the 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.350
 xperia z which is what I have of this 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.379
 side the left side the purple 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.619
 is bigger only here is a little 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.210
 bigger the finished here is like me 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.610
 I told them in the first video that I 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.470
 I'll leave right here in the description 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.899
 This is glass and this is plastic 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:21.009
 on this side as you can see in the part 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:23.110
 back in the camera is up here and 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.049
 this comes the camera in the center in the 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.850
 same device center over here 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.740
 below are the same and a difference 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.259
 key that they have to have in mind 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.319
 is that this device is proof of 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.300
 water the z is waterproof and the zl 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:39.640
 it's not waterproof it has to have 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:43.240
 this in mind because in case you 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.490
 I'll forget we'll be wrong wrong bad by the 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.409
 part of the front as you can see we can 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.300
 say oh this one has no camera and it's not 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.940
 that has the camera here below something a 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.130
 little crazy never seen while this one 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.710
 has the camera up here as they can 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.009
 see how I told you the systems are 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.409
 identical this one has it here in metal and 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.319
 he has it here in metal too 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.950
 let's see the buttons on the camera 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:10.830
 this one has a camera button 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.360
 to capture photos and this does not have the 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.069
 photo camera button we can 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.620
 capture from the screen of the 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:20.010
 device in this part we can see 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.599
 that if it differs a bit but this 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.040
 can confuse anyone that one 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.500
 You may think it's a different 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.910
 headphone jacket and it's the same helfon 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.310
 which is the intro from here the only thing that 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.530
 this as it is waterproof has the 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.260
 small charges here to protect it 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.569
 while this is not the same management 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.190
 since the 3.5 remember as much 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.500
 important this is not waterproof 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.280
 while this one if it comes 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.990
 infrared and this one does not have infrared 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.240
 well you tell me you guys 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.830
 think of these two taxes if in 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.270

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.450
