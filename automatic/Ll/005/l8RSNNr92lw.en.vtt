in the distributor because like so many
parts<00:02:29.450> of<00:02:29.569> posters<00:02:29.930> before<00:02:30.319> me<00:02:30.500> I<00:02:30.530> was<00:02:30.769> just

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
parts of posters before me I was just

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.100 
parts of posters before me I was just
sure<00:02:31.190> that's<00:02:31.489> what<00:02:31.640> was<00:02:31.790> wrong<00:02:31.940> with<00:02:32.180> it<00:02:32.360> I<00:02:32.599> had

out here and do this the right way so I
went<00:02:47.660> all<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.810> way<00:02:47.900> through<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:48.230> ignition

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
went all the way through the ignition

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.580 
went all the way through the ignition
system<00:02:48.799> make<00:02:49.760> sure<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:50.180> coil<00:02:50.390> was<00:02:50.569> firing<00:02:51.019> it

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
system make sure the coil was firing it

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.780 
system make sure the coil was firing it
was<00:02:52.840> plugs<00:02:53.840> are<00:02:54.049> firing<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:55.040> wires<00:02:55.280> went<00:02:55.610> plug

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
was plugs are firing the wires went plug

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.850 
was plugs are firing the wires went plug
wires<00:02:56.030> afire<00:02:56.420> and<00:02:56.569> they<00:02:56.629> use<00:02:56.810> my<00:02:56.959> little<00:02:57.620> spark

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
wires afire and they use my little spark

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.630 
wires afire and they use my little spark
tester<00:02:58.340> so<00:02:59.090> ignition<00:02:59.660> systems<00:03:00.160> up<00:03:01.160> to<00:03:01.400> snuff

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
tester so ignition systems up to snuff

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.030 
tester so ignition systems up to snuff
it<00:03:01.849> appears<00:03:02.180> I<00:03:02.480> went<00:03:03.410> ahead<00:03:03.470> and<00:03:03.739> put<00:03:03.860> a<00:03:03.890> new

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:10.210 
it appears I went ahead and put a new

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
coil wire on it asshole the new plug

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.930 
coil wire on it asshole the new plug
wire<00:03:10.430> on<00:03:10.640> it

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
wire on it

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.509

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
it today but I'm kind of running out of

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.330 
it today but I'm kind of running out of
daylight<00:03:14.959> and<00:03:15.319> I<00:03:15.380> wanted<00:03:15.620> to<00:03:15.709> see<00:03:15.889> how<00:03:16.010> this<00:03:16.160> is

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
daylight and I wanted to see how this is

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.059 
daylight and I wanted to see how this is
gonna<00:03:16.459> work<00:03:16.670> out<00:03:16.970> so<00:03:17.269> I'll<00:03:17.780> do<00:03:17.959> that<00:03:18.139> today

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.319 

main<00:03:22.069> thing<00:03:22.310> is<00:03:22.459> when<00:03:22.579> I<00:03:22.609> took<00:03:22.819> all<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.120> plugs

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
main thing is when I took all the plugs

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.090 
main thing is when I took all the plugs
out<00:03:23.540> they<00:03:23.750> were<00:03:23.810> all<00:03:23.959> just<00:03:24.230> found<00:03:24.530> out<00:03:24.769> like

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
out they were all just found out like

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.059 
out they were all just found out like
bigger<00:03:25.400> than<00:03:25.819> just<00:03:26.630> horrible<00:03:27.079> so<00:03:27.349> that

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
bigger than just horrible so that

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.050 
bigger than just horrible so that
was<00:03:28.190> probably<00:03:28.340> part<00:03:28.670> of<00:03:28.819> it<00:03:28.880> and<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:29.930> reason<00:03:30.380> I

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
was probably part of it and the reason I

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.640 
was probably part of it and the reason I
think<00:03:32.060> that<00:03:32.239> was<00:03:32.389> going<00:03:32.660> on<00:03:32.810> was<00:03:33.019> this<00:03:33.139> car<00:03:33.410> had

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
think that was going on was this car had

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.050 
think that was going on was this car had
a<00:03:33.680> really<00:03:34.040> bad<00:03:35.019> injector<00:03:36.019> in<00:03:36.139> it<00:03:36.609> you<00:03:37.609> cycle

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
a really bad injector in it you cycle

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.400 
a really bad injector in it you cycle
the<00:03:38.090> key<00:03:38.299> a<00:03:38.329> few<00:03:38.420> times<00:03:38.810> and<00:03:39.019> it<00:03:39.109> would<00:03:39.230> just

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
the key a few times and it would just

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.099 
the key a few times and it would just
sit<00:03:39.560> there<00:03:39.590> and<00:03:39.739> drip<00:03:39.980> fuel<00:03:40.340> into<00:03:40.639> the

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
sit there and drip fuel into the

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:49.539 
sit there and drip fuel into the
throttle<00:03:42.109> body<00:03:43.870> this<00:03:44.870> is<00:03:45.019> it<00:03:48.069> so<00:03:49.069> I<00:03:49.099> went<00:03:49.430> to

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
throttle body this is it so I went to

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.220 
throttle body this is it so I went to
like<00:03:49.790> I<00:03:49.819> said<00:03:50.060> I<00:03:50.120> wanted<00:03:50.419> the<00:03:50.540> junkyard<00:03:51.019> today

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
like I said I wanted the junkyard today

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.319 
like I said I wanted the junkyard today
and<00:03:51.500> got<00:03:51.650> another<00:03:51.919> one<00:03:52.160> I<00:03:52.400> think<00:03:53.090> the<00:03:53.180> one<00:03:53.299> I

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
and got another one I think the one I

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.800 
and got another one I think the one I
put<00:03:53.569> inside<00:03:53.720> of<00:03:53.989> a<00:03:54.139> 2.5<00:03:54.799> bit<00:03:55.130> oh<00:03:55.400> well<00:03:56.389> who

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
put inside of a 2.5 bit oh well who

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.349 
put inside of a 2.5 bit oh well who
cares<00:03:57.459> and<00:03:58.459> so<00:03:59.419> yeah<00:04:00.190> they<00:04:01.190> don't<00:04:02.000> appear<00:04:02.329> to

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:02.359 
cares and so yeah they don't appear to

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:04.330 
cares and so yeah they don't appear to
be<00:04:02.450> leaking<00:04:02.900> like<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:03.829> other<00:04:03.950> one<00:04:04.130> wasn't

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
be leaking like the other one wasn't

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.879 
be leaking like the other one wasn't
ripping<00:04:04.940> or<00:04:05.060> whatever<00:04:05.419> so<00:04:05.720> I'm<00:04:06.590> gonna<00:04:06.739> hook

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:06.889 
ripping or whatever so I'm gonna hook

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:08.319 
ripping or whatever so I'm gonna hook
the<00:04:07.010> battery<00:04:07.160> up<00:04:07.459> and<00:04:07.639> I'll<00:04:07.700> give<00:04:08.030> this<00:04:08.120> thing

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
the battery up and I'll give this thing

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:12.220 
the battery up and I'll give this thing
a<00:04:08.389> try<00:04:09.280> I<00:04:10.450> don't<00:04:11.450> know<00:04:11.510> if<00:04:11.569> means<00:04:11.750> I<00:04:11.870> did<00:04:12.019> put

a try I don't know if means I did put

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.590 
a try I don't know if means I did put

this engine today and it's it's got

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.870 
this engine today and it's it's got
really<00:04:24.200> low<00:04:24.500> compression<00:04:24.920> on<00:04:25.160> one<00:04:25.340> sooner<00:04:25.580> so

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
really low compression on one sooner so

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.540 
really low compression on one sooner so
I<00:04:25.910> think<00:04:25.970> it's<00:04:26.270> kind<00:04:26.480> of<00:04:26.510> a<00:04:26.600> tits<00:04:26.810> head<00:04:26.960> gasket

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
I think it's kind of a tits head gasket

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.180 
I think it's kind of a tits head gasket
which<00:04:28.630> is<00:04:29.630> not<00:04:29.900> surprising<00:04:30.410> on<00:04:30.740> one<00:04:30.920> of<00:04:30.950> these

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
which is not surprising on one of these

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.360 
which is not surprising on one of these
for<00:04:31.580> some<00:04:31.730> reason<00:04:32.120> I<00:04:32.270> don't<00:04:32.360> know<00:04:32.480> why<00:04:32.600> they<00:04:33.370> my

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
for some reason I don't know why they my

head<00:04:36.620> gaskets<00:04:37.160> but<00:04:37.340> they<00:04:37.460> did<00:04:37.960> so<00:04:38.960> weight<00:04:39.770> away

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
head gaskets but they did so weight away

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.910 
head gaskets but they did so weight away
