00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:02.479
 Spread the mold and pinions now to 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:04.430

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.190
 we throw out all the flour 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.159
 Today we also forgive the noise 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:19.220
 the oil that is more or less that 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:23.840
 amount a little more than half a cup of 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:27.409
 coffee approximately we throw the milk 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.479
 condensed from this boat I'm going to 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:33.479
 throw like half 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.479
 approximately 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.920
 well more or less 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:46.110
 and now we would throw the three teaspoons 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.110
 of yeast coffee 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.790
 good and now with the blender 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.140
 already mix and masters 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.140
 all this mass 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.300
 Well now we would start to throw 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.890
 the dough in the mold that previously 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.490
 Well I've given you a little bit of 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.429
 butter so that later it does not stick and 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:14.380
 it is not much easier to unmold what 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:19.220
 we were a little bit 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:21.410
 and now we could take for example 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.090
 a few and also use the 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.540
 hands forgiven in cayo there are some 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.540
 how many 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:35.230
 of pine nuts and we can also throw 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:37.870
 I will use some cute hand 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:42.690
 beautiful cherries 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.690
 in each place we call it in a way 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:52.250
 and now we would continue with throwing more 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.250
 dough 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.930
 good as you see it has already taken all 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.569
 cherry all the pine nuts the last 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.790
 let's say mass and now 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.739
 I would directly take it to the oven myself 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.470
 I have preheated it to 180 degrees a 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.239
 I spend about 10 minutes and now we're going 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.330
 to put then about 20 minutes 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:17.019
 approximately come let's go well 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.019
 nothing now 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:24.590
 it will have to be about 20 minutes 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:27.260
 approximately 180 degrees and you know 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.329
 to see if it is or not we put a 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.400
 little knife if it comes clean is that it is 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:34.420
 there but you have to leave it a little bit more 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.420
 come as expected 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.090
 Well, come on, the 20's have already passed 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.830
 minutes let's try the little knife 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.920
 let's see if we get more or less clean 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.070
 well watching I would leave it a little 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.070
 plus 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.230
 Well, I've already left it with about 5 or 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.420
 6 more minutes 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.880
 and let's see here 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.620
 and without looking so totally clean so 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.260
 that nothing now we are going to pass it to the 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.020
 good source because nothing as you see already what 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.480
 I just unmold and you're ready to 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.260
 eat just let it cool and ya 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.000
 is 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.000
 come on then I hope you like it
