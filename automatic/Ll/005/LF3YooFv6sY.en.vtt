so you've spent the best part of the

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.499 
so you've spent the best part of the
past<00:00:02.580> few<00:00:03.030> weeks<00:00:03.389> months<00:00:04.200> possibly<00:00:04.799> years

past few weeks months possibly years
studying<00:00:06.509> PHP<00:00:07.370> you<00:00:08.370> can<00:00:08.610> construct<00:00:08.910> PHP<00:00:09.780> web

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
studying PHP you can construct PHP web

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.379 
studying PHP you can construct PHP web
applications<00:00:10.769> so<00:00:11.700> you're<00:00:11.969> more<00:00:12.120> or<00:00:12.179> less<00:00:12.269> a

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
applications so you're more or less a

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.990 
applications so you're more or less a
developer<00:00:12.960> now<00:00:13.429> now<00:00:14.429> what<00:00:14.639> we're<00:00:14.730> going<00:00:14.910> to

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
developer now now what we're going to

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.080 
developer now now what we're going to
focus<00:00:15.179> on<00:00:15.509> is<00:00:15.719> turning<00:00:16.020> you<00:00:16.170> into<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.619> good<00:00:17.100> PHP

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
focus on is turning you into a good PHP

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.580 
focus on is turning you into a good PHP
developer<00:00:18.600> we're<00:00:18.930> going<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.170> teach<00:00:19.350> you<00:00:19.500> how

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
developer we're going to teach you how

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.560 
developer we're going to teach you how
to<00:00:19.619> follow<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.100> best<00:00:20.310> possible<00:00:20.970> practices

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
to follow the best possible practices

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.980 
to follow the best possible practices
and<00:00:21.810> we're<00:00:22.560> going<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.769> start<00:00:22.980> with<00:00:23.070> passwords

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
and we're going to start with passwords

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.080 
and we're going to start with passwords
now<00:00:24.990> let's<00:00:25.230> face<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:25.560> our<00:00:25.949> users<00:00:26.789> aren't

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
now let's face it our users aren't

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.529 
now let's face it our users aren't
exactly<00:00:27.630> smart<00:00:28.429> they<00:00:29.429> don't<00:00:29.789> want<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.210> list<00:00:30.359> the

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
exactly smart they don't want a list the

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.330 
exactly smart they don't want a list the
majority<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.109> them<00:00:31.349> don't<00:00:31.560> know<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:31.830> your

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
majority of them don't know that your

they<00:00:40.530> don't<00:00:40.770> know<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.219> should<00:00:41.250> be<00:00:41.550> using

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
they don't know that you should be using

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.060 
they don't know that you should be using
a<00:00:42.300> different<00:00:42.480> password<00:00:43.079> for<00:00:43.110> each<00:00:43.500> website

a different password for each website

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.119 
a different password for each website
you<00:00:44.280> use<00:00:44.660> so<00:00:45.660> we<00:00:45.840> have<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.260> take<00:00:46.469> precautionary

that<00:00:58.649> we<00:00:58.890> use<00:00:59.070> password<00:00:59.579> hashing<00:01:00.859> now<00:01:01.859> you've

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
that we use password hashing now you've

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.979 
that we use password hashing now you've
been<00:01:02.250> studying<00:01:02.550> PHP<00:01:03.210> for<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> long<00:01:03.570> time<00:01:03.780> now

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
been studying PHP for a long time now

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.329 
been studying PHP for a long time now
you've<00:01:04.140> probably<00:01:04.290> heard<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.890> password

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
you've probably heard of password

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.300 
you've probably heard of password
hashing<00:01:05.930> you've<00:01:06.930> probably<00:01:07.200> also<00:01:07.619> heard<00:01:07.890> of

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
hashing you've probably also heard of

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.899 
hashing you've probably also heard of

technology evolves we shouldn't be using

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.910 
technology evolves we shouldn't be using
anymore

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
anymore

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.550 
anymore
not<00:01:19.920> because<00:01:20.159> it's<00:01:20.759> insecure<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.780> itself

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
not because it's insecure in itself

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.850 
not because it's insecure in itself
basically<00:01:23.460> it's<00:01:24.060> fast<00:01:24.479> which<00:01:25.320> means<00:01:25.619> that

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
basically it's fast which means that

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.920 
basically it's fast which means that
hackers<00:01:26.280> can<00:01:26.430> try<00:01:26.939> billions<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.750> different

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
hackers can try billions of different

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.249 
hackers can try billions of different
combinations<00:01:28.799> per<00:01:29.400> second<00:01:30.030> on<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.299> single<00:01:30.900> GPU

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
combinations per second on a single GPU

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.580 
combinations per second on a single GPU
and<00:01:31.970> that's<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.150> problem<00:01:33.390> with<00:01:33.659> md5<00:01:35.720> so<00:01:36.720> what

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
and that's the problem with md5 so what

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.859 
and that's the problem with md5 so what
we<00:01:37.710> do<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.450> we<00:01:39.450> use<00:01:39.630> something<00:01:39.659> like<00:01:39.990> pH<00:01:40.740> Pass

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
we do is we use something like pH Pass

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.899 
we do is we use something like pH Pass
now<00:01:42.869> we<00:01:42.930> can<00:01:43.290> download<00:01:43.619> pH<00:01:44.070> pass<00:01:44.340> from<00:01:44.490> open

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
now we can download pH pass from open

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.749 
now we can download pH pass from open
wall<00:01:45.119> comm<00:01:45.600> /bh<00:01:46.409> pass<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.009> we<00:01:47.159> can<00:01:47.340> click<00:01:47.520> this

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
wall comm /bh pass and we can click this

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.510 
wall comm /bh pass and we can click this
now<00:01:48.750> I've<00:01:48.930> already<00:01:49.140> got<00:01:49.259> my<00:01:49.500> project<00:01:49.979> set<00:01:50.369> up

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
now I've already got my project set up

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.010 
now I've already got my project set up
here<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.970> have<00:01:51.090> pH<00:01:52.009> pH<00:01:53.009> Pass<00:01:53.399> installed<00:01:54.060> as<00:01:54.299> we

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
here I have pH pH Pass installed as we

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.859 
here I have pH pH Pass installed as we
can<00:01:55.200> see<00:01:55.409> here<00:01:56.119> so<00:01:57.119> I'm<00:01:57.329> going<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.659> demonstrate

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
can see here so I'm going to demonstrate

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.010 
can see here so I'm going to demonstrate
how<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.439> use<00:01:58.799> this<00:01:59.360> the<00:02:00.360> first<00:02:00.630> thing<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:00.840> we

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
how to use this the first thing that we

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.380 
how to use this the first thing that we
want<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.229> do<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:01.710> obviously<00:02:01.979> include<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.969> file

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
want to do is obviously include the file

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.420 
want to do is obviously include the file
except<00:02:05.440> the<00:02:06.440> next<00:02:06.680> thing<00:02:06.830> that<00:02:06.950> we<00:02:07.040> want<00:02:07.220> to<00:02:07.280> do

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
except the next thing that we want to do

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.660 
except the next thing that we want to do
is<00:02:07.670> instantiate<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:09.649> class<00:02:10.070> so<00:02:10.520> we'll

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
is instantiate the the class so we'll

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.160 
is instantiate the the class so we'll
call<00:02:10.880> this<00:02:11.000> hash<00:02:11.300> and<00:02:11.600> we'll<00:02:11.750> say<00:02:11.900> new

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
call this hash and we'll say new

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.030 
call this hash and we'll say new
password

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
password

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.600 
password
ash<00:02:13.310> and<00:02:13.670> if<00:02:14.570> we<00:02:14.720> just<00:02:14.750> go<00:02:15.110> to<00:02:15.710> our<00:02:15.860> constructor

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
ash and if we just go to our constructor

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.230 
ash and if we just go to our constructor
we<00:02:17.420> can<00:02:17.600> see<00:02:17.810> it<00:02:17.900> takes<00:02:18.020> two<00:02:18.350> parameters<00:02:19.240> the

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
we can see it takes two parameters the

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.450 
we can see it takes two parameters the
first<00:02:20.510> is<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.870> iteration<00:02:21.320> count<00:02:21.740> log<00:02:21.980> which

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
first is the iteration count log which

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.180 
first is the iteration count log which
is<00:02:22.730> an<00:02:23.210> integer<00:02:23.720> which<00:02:24.530> we're<00:02:24.770> going<00:02:24.920> to<00:02:24.980> pass

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
is an integer which we're going to pass

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.370 
is an integer which we're going to pass
in<00:02:25.430> 8<00:02:25.640> which<00:02:26.090> is<00:02:26.150> also<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.690> recommended

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
in 8 which is also the recommended

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.250 
in 8 which is also the recommended
number<00:02:27.560> and<00:02:28.150> then<00:02:29.150> we<00:02:29.270> have<00:02:29.390> portable<00:02:29.870> hashes

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
number and then we have portable hashes

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.390 
number and then we have portable hashes
which<00:02:30.440> we're<00:02:30.650> going<00:02:30.800> to<00:02:30.890> say<00:02:31.100> false<00:02:33.010> so<00:02:34.010> next

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
which we're going to say false so next

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.530 
which we're going to say false so next
thing<00:02:34.550> that<00:02:34.670> we're<00:02:34.850> going<00:02:35.000> to<00:02:35.060> do<00:02:35.210> is<00:02:35.390> we're

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
thing that we're going to do is we're

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.750 
thing that we're going to do is we're
going<00:02:35.690> to<00:02:35.780> set<00:02:36.080> a<00:02:36.290> password<00:02:36.709> so<00:02:37.520> we're<00:02:37.640> going

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
going to set a password so we're going

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.430 
going to set a password so we're going
to<00:02:37.820> call<00:02:37.970> it<00:02:38.120> on<00:02:38.330> hashed<00:02:38.630> I'm<00:02:38.900> going<00:02:39.140> to<00:02:39.230> set

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
to call it on hashed I'm going to set

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.520 
to call it on hashed I'm going to set
this<00:02:39.560> to<00:02:39.770> secret<00:02:40.630> now<00:02:41.630> we're<00:02:41.959> going<00:02:42.110> to<00:02:42.200> hash

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
this to secret now we're going to hash

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.410 
this to secret now we're going to hash
the<00:02:42.770> password<00:02:42.800> so<00:02:43.459> going<00:02:43.670> to<00:02:43.730> say<00:02:43.910> hash<00:02:44.180> equals

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
the password so going to say hash equals

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.900 
the password so going to say hash equals
hash<00:02:45.080> hash<00:02:45.920> password<00:02:47.470> unhatched<00:02:48.550> so<00:02:49.550> now<00:02:49.670> if

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
hash hash password unhatched so now if

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.230 
hash hash password unhatched so now if
we<00:02:50.030> just<00:02:50.060> echo<00:02:50.540> this<00:02:50.870> out<00:02:51.140> and<00:02:51.760> we<00:02:52.760> go<00:02:52.910> to<00:02:52.970> our

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
we just echo this out and we go to our

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.570 
we just echo this out and we go to our
browser<00:02:53.510> refresh<00:02:54.050> we<00:02:54.830> can<00:02:54.890> see<00:02:55.070> that<00:02:55.370> we<00:02:55.430> get

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
browser refresh we can see that we get

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.760 
browser refresh we can see that we get
this<00:02:55.760> big<00:02:56.060> long<00:02:56.450> I<00:02:56.750> think<00:02:56.989> it's<00:02:57.110> about<00:02:57.260> 60

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
this big long I think it's about 60

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.500 
this big long I think it's about 60
characters<00:02:58.130> hash<00:03:00.280> so<00:03:01.280> that<00:03:01.730> when<00:03:02.030> our<00:03:02.060> user

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
characters hash so that when our user

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.720 
characters hash so that when our user
signs<00:03:02.930> up<00:03:03.110> to<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.350> site<00:03:03.590> this<00:03:03.950> hash<00:03:04.310> is<00:03:04.580> what

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
signs up to the site this hash is what

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.510 
signs up to the site this hash is what
we<00:03:04.850> want<00:03:05.060> to<00:03:05.120> store<00:03:05.510> in<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:05.840> database<00:03:05.989> so<00:03:06.560> how

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
we want to store in the database so how

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.630 
we want to store in the database so how
do<00:03:07.580> we<00:03:07.850> know<00:03:08.060> if<00:03:08.360> a<00:03:08.630> hash<00:03:08.950> matches<00:03:09.950> a<00:03:10.130> unhatched

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
do we know if a hash matches a unhatched

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.229 
do we know if a hash matches a unhatched
password<00:03:11.769> we<00:03:12.769> use<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:13.519> check<00:03:13.850> password

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
password we use the check password

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.830 
password we use the check password
method<00:03:14.989> so<00:03:15.290> if<00:03:15.380> we<00:03:15.530> say<00:03:15.739> if<00:03:16.010> hash<00:03:16.840> check

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
method so if we say if hash check

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.820 
method so if we say if hash check
password<00:03:18.580> now<00:03:19.580> I<00:03:19.640> always<00:03:19.880> forget<00:03:20.269> this<00:03:20.540> e<00:03:20.830> the

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
password now I always forget this e the

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.030 
password now I always forget this e the
unhatched<00:03:22.489> password<00:03:23.000> goes<00:03:23.209> first<00:03:23.600> and<00:03:24.040> the

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
unhatched password goes first and the

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.590 
unhatched password goes first and the
hash<00:03:25.220> password<00:03:25.700> goes<00:03:25.940> second

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
hash password goes second

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.759 
hash password goes second
so<00:03:27.230> if<00:03:27.440> has<00:03:27.739> check<00:03:28.040> password<00:03:28.280> gone<00:03:28.820> to<00:03:29.000> echo

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
so if has check password gone to echo

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:35.259 
so if has check password gone to echo
match<00:03:32.019> so<00:03:33.019> let's<00:03:33.200> try<00:03:33.380> this<00:03:33.440> out<00:03:33.739> perfect<00:03:34.730> if

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
match so let's try this out perfect if

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.300 
match so let's try this out perfect if
we<00:03:35.330> would<00:03:35.660> do<00:03:35.780> change<00:03:36.110> this<00:03:36.500> to<00:03:37.070> something

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
we would do change this to something

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.360 
we would do change this to something
else<00:03:38.170> we<00:03:39.170> first<00:03:39.440> we're<00:03:39.799> not<00:03:39.950> going<00:03:40.160> to<00:03:40.250> get

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
else we first we're not going to get

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.840 
else we first we're not going to get
that<00:03:40.549> because<00:03:40.940> it<00:03:41.570> doesn't<00:03:41.900> match<00:03:42.580> so<00:03:43.580> let's

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
that because it doesn't match so let's

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.270 
that because it doesn't match so let's
put<00:03:44.060> this<00:03:44.150> back<00:03:44.420> to<00:03:44.600> unhatched<00:03:44.959> and<00:03:45.590> that's

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
put this back to unhatched and that's

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.770 
put this back to unhatched and that's
basically<00:03:46.790> all<00:03:47.030> but<00:03:47.720> it<00:03:48.230> requires<00:03:48.970> now<00:03:49.970> in<00:03:50.150> PHP

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
basically all but it requires now in PHP

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.900 
basically all but it requires now in PHP
5.5<00:03:51.680> and<00:03:52.420> up<00:03:53.739> PHP<00:03:54.739> actually<00:03:54.980> includes<00:03:55.640> this

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
5.5 and up PHP actually includes this

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.539 
5.5 and up PHP actually includes this
functionality<00:03:56.420> themselves<00:03:57.320> so<00:03:57.769> I'm<00:03:58.190> going<00:03:58.459> to

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
functionality themselves so I'm going to

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.789 
functionality themselves so I'm going to
demonstrate<00:03:58.730> that<00:03:59.209> now<00:03:59.440> but<00:04:00.440> let's<00:04:00.620> just

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
demonstrate that now but let's just

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.880 
demonstrate that now but let's just
comment<00:04:01.070> this<00:04:01.280> out<00:04:02.320> we're<00:04:03.320> going<00:04:03.500> to<00:04:03.620> change

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
comment this out we're going to change

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.020 
comment this out we're going to change
this<00:04:04.310> to<00:04:05.030> password<00:04:05.959> hash<00:04:06.700> we're<00:04:07.700> going<00:04:07.910> to

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
this to password hash we're going to

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.970 
this to password hash we're going to
enter<00:04:08.209> our<00:04:08.420> password<00:04:08.630> and<00:04:09.140> the<00:04:09.350> second<00:04:09.739> grant

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
enter our password and the second grant

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.310 
enter our password and the second grant
is<00:04:10.190> the<00:04:10.310> type<00:04:10.640> of<00:04:10.820> flash<00:04:11.000> we<00:04:11.150> want<00:04:11.330> to<00:04:11.450> use<00:04:11.630> I'm

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
is the type of flash we want to use I'm

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.680 
is the type of flash we want to use I'm
just<00:04:12.560> going<00:04:12.739> to<00:04:12.829> say<00:04:12.980> password<00:04:13.280> default<00:04:14.239> which

just going to say password default which

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.660 
just going to say password default which
is<00:04:14.720> a<00:04:14.900> constant

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
is a constant
