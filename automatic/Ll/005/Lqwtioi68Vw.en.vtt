unique innovation call magic step and

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.480 
unique innovation call magic step and
what<00:02:46.900> that<00:02:47.110> is<00:02:47.140> is<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.680> series<00:02:48.100> of<00:02:48.280> steps

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
what that is is the series of steps

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.860 
what that is is the series of steps
right<00:02:48.820> the<00:02:49.030> way<00:02:49.150> down<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:49.480> length<00:02:49.630> of<00:02:49.780> the

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
right the way down the length of the

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.860 
right the way down the length of the
pole<00:02:50.080> with<00:02:50.680> a<00:02:50.710> unique<00:02:51.130> teflon<00:02:51.730> point<00:02:52.390> to<00:02:52.750> the

step which means the elastic runs along
the<00:02:55.660> point<00:02:56.020> of<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.290> step<00:02:56.560> giving<00:02:57.130> you

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
the point of the step giving you

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.020 
the point of the step giving you
completely<00:02:58.060> free<00:02:58.240> flow<00:02:58.510> elastic<00:02:59.020> so<00:02:59.290> again

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
completely free flow elastic so again

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.850 
completely free flow elastic so again
elastic<00:03:01.030> stick<00:03:01.330> absolutely<00:03:02.140> thing<00:03:02.620> of<00:03:02.770> the
