post<00:00:12.269> position<00:00:12.750> we're<00:00:13.320> coming<00:00:13.740> out<00:00:13.860> at<00:00:14.070> 45

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
post position we're coming out at 45

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.160 
post position we're coming out at 45
degrees<00:00:15.859> digging<00:00:16.859> getting<00:00:17.789> going<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.690> our

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
degrees digging getting going and our

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.320 
degrees digging getting going and our
the<00:00:19.800> purpose<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.580> start<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:21.090> to

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
the purpose of the start is to

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.210 
the purpose of the start is to
eventually<00:00:21.960> get<00:00:22.170> into<00:00:22.350> vertical<00:00:22.830> running

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
eventually get into vertical running

eventually get into vertical running
position<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:24.090> course<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.570> can't<00:00:24.840> go<00:00:25.050> right<00:00:25.380> to

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
position of course you can't go right to

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.679 
position of course you can't go right to
it<00:00:25.920> so<00:00:26.490> we're<00:00:26.670> just<00:00:26.699> going<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.060> be<00:00:27.119> like<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.300> post

go a common error is people know that
you're<00:00:56.309> supposed<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.760> be<00:00:56.940> low<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.539> they'll

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
you're supposed to be low so they'll

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.979 
you're supposed to be low so they'll
have<00:00:58.649> them<00:00:58.859> they'll<00:00:59.609> have<00:00:59.789> runners<00:01:00.030> bend<00:01:00.510> over

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
have them they'll have runners bend over

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.590 
have them they'll have runners bend over
at<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.770> corner<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.640> saying<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.300> force

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
at a corner and the saying is that force

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.380 
at a corner and the saying is that force
can't<00:01:04.049> turn<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.320> corner<00:01:04.700> force<00:01:05.700> has<00:01:05.970> got<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.270> be

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
can't turn a corner force has got to be

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.420 
can't turn a corner force has got to be
on<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.659> straight<00:01:07.260> post<00:01:07.619> coming<00:01:08.189> through<00:01:08.340> the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
on a straight post coming through the

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.250 
on a straight post coming through the
body<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:09.210> if<00:01:09.330> you've<00:01:09.510> bent<00:01:09.689> over<00:01:09.869> it's<00:01:10.110> just

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
body so if you've bent over it's just

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.830 
body so if you've bent over it's just
going<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.439> be<00:01:10.530> going<00:01:10.710> lost<00:01:11.010> out<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.280> space<00:01:11.840> some

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
going to be going lost out in space some

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.969 
going to be going lost out in space some
people<00:01:13.170> know<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.439> you're<00:01:13.619> supposed<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.920> have

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
people know that you're supposed to have

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.770 
people know that you're supposed to have
your<00:01:14.070> head<00:01:14.430> down<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.909> start<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.360> they'll<00:01:15.570> say

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
your head down to start so they'll say

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.510 
your head down to start so they'll say
keep<00:01:16.170> your<00:01:16.320> head<00:01:16.560> down<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:18.030> more<00:01:18.240> powerful

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
keep your head down the more powerful

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.460 
keep your head down the more powerful
stronger<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> person<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.960> lower<00:01:22.200> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
stronger that a person is the lower the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.590 
stronger that a person is the lower the
longer<00:01:22.979> they're<00:01:23.130> going<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.369> be<00:01:23.520> lower<00:01:23.790> because

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
longer they're going to be lower because

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.899 
longer they're going to be lower because
they<00:01:24.960> have<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.259> power<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.610> be<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:26.759> this

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
they have the power to be in this

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.569 
they have the power to be in this
position<00:01:27.150> this<00:01:27.630> driving<00:01:27.960> position<00:01:28.650> putting

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
position this driving position putting

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.270 
position this driving position putting
off<00:01:29.759> so<00:01:30.659> if<00:01:31.020> they're<00:01:31.350> not<00:01:31.380> as<00:01:31.740> powerful

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
off so if they're not as powerful

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.969 
off so if they're not as powerful
they're<00:01:32.490> going<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.759> come<00:01:33.000> up<00:01:33.150> quicker<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.380> you

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
they're going to come up quicker and you

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.340 
they're going to come up quicker and you
can't<00:01:35.280> just<00:01:35.549> fix<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.119> by<00:01:36.420> having<00:01:36.840> them<00:01:37.110> bend

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
can't just fix this by having them bend

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.969 
can't just fix this by having them bend
over<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:38.579> gotta<00:01:39.079> practice<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.409> starts<00:01:40.829> and

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
over you gotta practice the starts and

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.620 
over you gotta practice the starts and
hopefully<00:01:41.610> through<00:01:41.759> practice<00:01:42.150> they<00:01:42.270> can<00:01:42.329> get

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
hopefully through practice they can get

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.649 
hopefully through practice they can get
more<00:01:42.780> explosive<00:01:43.530> where<00:01:44.159> they<00:01:44.340> can<00:01:44.659> have

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
more explosive where they can have

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.690 
more explosive where they can have
enough<00:01:45.899> power<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.170> come<00:01:46.680> out<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.130> then<00:01:47.369> slowly

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
enough power to come out and then slowly

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.359 
enough power to come out and then slowly
come<00:01:47.850> up<00:01:48.409> we're<00:01:49.409> going<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.590> be<00:01:49.740> like<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.950> post

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
come up we're going to be like a post

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.389 
come up we're going to be like a post
it's<00:01:51.270> going<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.630> go<00:01:51.750> from<00:01:51.990> your<00:01:52.140> head<00:01:52.409> through

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
it's going to go from your head through

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.460 
it's going to go from your head through
your<00:01:53.430> neck<00:01:53.820> straight<00:01:54.420> down<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.899> your<00:01:54.930> legs
