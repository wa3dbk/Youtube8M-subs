marie-line here's the the 2013 Voodoo as
you<00:00:16.120> can<00:00:16.299> tell<00:00:16.450> the<00:00:16.600> graphics<00:00:17.260> are<00:00:17.470> pretty

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
you can tell the graphics are pretty

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.970 
you can tell the graphics are pretty
sick<00:00:18.670> just<00:00:18.910> like<00:00:19.120> last<00:00:19.360> year<00:00:19.680> we<00:00:20.680> even<00:00:20.710> got

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
sick just like last year we even got

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.190 
sick just like last year we even got
some<00:00:21.130> some<00:00:21.760> really<00:00:21.940> nice<00:00:22.090> detail<00:00:22.300> down<00:00:22.810> into

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:23.200 
some some really nice detail down into

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.940 
some some really nice detail down into
to<00:00:23.830> the<00:00:23.980> grip<00:00:24.360> with<00:00:25.360> the<00:00:25.390> Voodoo<00:00:25.660> graphics<00:00:26.350> the

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:26.950 
to the grip with the Voodoo graphics the

to the grip with the Voodoo graphics the
Buddha<00:00:27.220> this<00:00:27.370> year<00:00:27.640> is<00:00:28.590> we've<00:00:29.590> made<00:00:29.800> some

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.010 
Buddha this year is we've made some

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.280 
Buddha this year is we've made some
pretty<00:00:30.190> significant<00:00:30.790> changes<00:00:31.150> the<00:00:32.050> swing

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
pretty significant changes the swing

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.440 
pretty significant changes the swing
weight<00:00:32.469> this<00:00:32.680> year<00:00:32.920> is<00:00:33.160> it<00:00:34.030> is<00:00:34.210> more<00:00:34.480> balanced

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
weight this year is it is more balanced

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.669 
weight this year is it is more balanced
and<00:00:37.450> you'll<00:00:37.600> feel<00:00:37.809> that<00:00:38.050> soon<00:00:38.350> as<00:00:38.410> you<00:00:38.469> get<00:00:38.589> it

00:00:38.669 --> 00:00:38.679 
and you'll feel that soon as you get it

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:40.470 
and you'll feel that soon as you get it
into<00:00:38.800> your<00:00:38.920> hands<00:00:39.190> the<00:00:39.579> difference<00:00:40.269> and

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
into your hands the difference and

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.880 
into your hands the difference and
imbalance<00:00:41.019> they're<00:00:41.699> repositioning<00:00:43.890> there's

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
imbalance they're repositioning there's

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.619 
imbalance they're repositioning there's
some<00:00:45.010> things<00:00:45.190> inside<00:00:45.550> the<00:00:45.730> barrel<00:00:46.089> we<00:00:46.480> got

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
some things inside the barrel we got

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.829 
some things inside the barrel we got
that<00:00:46.809> new<00:00:46.929> composite<00:00:47.530> the<00:00:47.769> TR<00:00:48.039> 3<00:00:48.370> FL<00:00:48.760> o<00:00:48.969> which

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:49.839 
that new composite the TR 3 FL o which

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:51.450 
that new composite the TR 3 FL o which
is<00:00:49.960> the<00:00:50.079> composite<00:00:50.559> that<00:00:50.649> we<00:00:50.769> talked<00:00:50.949> about<00:00:51.100> on

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
is the composite that we talked about on

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.559 
is the composite that we talked about on
our<00:00:51.489> CF<00:00:51.940> 5<00:00:52.149> line<00:00:53.280> which<00:00:54.280> makes<00:00:54.579> for<00:00:54.909> being<00:00:55.480> a

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:55.569 
our CF 5 line which makes for being a

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:58.439 
our CF 5 line which makes for being a
fuse<00:00:55.809> composite<00:00:56.350> again<00:00:56.620> it<00:00:57.249> it's<00:00:58.089> a<00:00:58.179> thinner

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
fuse composite again it it's a thinner

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.599 
fuse composite again it it's a thinner
makes<00:00:58.899> the<00:00:59.109> composite<00:00:59.589> layer<00:00:59.739> thinner<00:01:00.190> more

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:00.609 
makes the composite layer thinner more

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:04.920 
makes the composite layer thinner more
durable<00:01:02.190> but<00:01:03.190> a<00:01:03.219> stronger<00:01:03.670> composite<00:01:04.629> the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
durable but a stronger composite the

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.380 
durable but a stronger composite the
alloy<00:01:05.199> this<00:01:05.409> year<00:01:05.650> for<00:01:06.280> the<00:01:06.370> Voodoo<00:01:07.150> the

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
alloy this year for the Voodoo the

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.120 
alloy this year for the Voodoo the
Beckham<00:01:07.870> and<00:01:08.080> the<00:01:08.290> m2m<00:01:08.770> is<00:01:09.250> a<00:01:09.490> new<00:01:09.790> x10<00:01:10.689> alloy

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
Beckham and the m2m is a new x10 alloy

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.649 
Beckham and the m2m is a new x10 alloy
our<00:01:12.130> engineers<00:01:12.520> have<00:01:12.610> come<00:01:13.000> up<00:01:13.119> with<00:01:13.149> it's<00:01:13.600> a

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
our engineers have come up with it's a

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.590 
our engineers have come up with it's a
special<00:01:13.990> blend<00:01:14.079> of<00:01:14.350> alloy<00:01:15.219> agents<00:01:15.729> to<00:01:16.479> make

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
special blend of alloy agents to make

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.800 
special blend of alloy agents to make
the<00:01:16.719> aluminum<00:01:17.079> stronger<00:01:18.090> which<00:01:19.090> allows<00:01:19.390> us<00:01:19.630> to

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
the aluminum stronger which allows us to

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.230 
the aluminum stronger which allows us to
fine-tune<00:01:20.320> the<00:01:20.469> barrels<00:01:20.799> even<00:01:21.130> more<00:01:21.340> so<00:01:21.759> the

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
fine-tune the barrels even more so the

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.260 
fine-tune the barrels even more so the
aluminum<00:01:22.509> on<00:01:22.840> this<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:24.130> walls<00:01:24.399> are<00:01:24.579> the<00:01:25.090> walls

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
aluminum on this the walls are the walls

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.219 
aluminum on this the walls are the walls
are<00:01:25.420> very<00:01:25.450> thin<00:01:25.899> so<00:01:26.079> it's<00:01:26.200> going<00:01:26.320> to<00:01:26.380> create<00:01:26.770> a

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
are very thin so it's going to create a

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.959 
are very thin so it's going to create a
great<00:01:29.229> trampoline<00:01:29.770> effect<00:01:29.890> and<00:01:30.430> then<00:01:30.759> at<00:01:30.850> the

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:30.969 
great trampoline effect and then at the

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:33.810 
great trampoline effect and then at the
same<00:01:31.119> time<00:01:31.180> with<00:01:31.630> this<00:01:31.810> a<00:01:31.869> proprietary<00:01:32.820> alloy

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
same time with this a proprietary alloy

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.420 
same time with this a proprietary alloy
blend<00:01:34.240> it's<00:01:35.109> going<00:01:35.289> to<00:01:35.380> provide<00:01:35.680> a<00:01:35.710> stronger

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
blend it's going to provide a stronger

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.819 
blend it's going to provide a stronger
and<00:01:36.820> a<00:01:37.119> more<00:01:37.479> durable<00:01:37.810> product<00:01:38.289> the<00:01:38.649> Buddha

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
and a more durable product the Buddha

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:41.700 
and a more durable product the Buddha
has<00:01:39.009> an<00:01:39.159> eye<00:01:39.310> on<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:40.149> end<00:01:40.359> cap<00:01:40.600> which<00:01:41.320> is<00:01:41.350> bait

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
has an eye on the end cap which is bait

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.230 
has an eye on the end cap which is bait
it's<00:01:42.039> made<00:01:42.460> up<00:01:42.579> of<00:01:42.700> two<00:01:42.759> different<00:01:43.119> materials

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
it's made up of two different materials

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.779 
it's made up of two different materials
and<00:01:43.869> basically<00:01:44.770> what<00:01:45.009> it<00:01:45.100> does<00:01:45.250> is<00:01:45.490> it<00:01:45.670> helps

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
and basically what it does is it helps

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.580 
and basically what it does is it helps
keep<00:01:46.119> the<00:01:46.509> barrel<00:01:48.420> rigid<00:01:49.420> or<00:01:49.990> a<00:01:50.020> little<00:01:50.350> stiff

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
keep the barrel rigid or a little stiff

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.969 
keep the barrel rigid or a little stiff
on<00:01:50.829> the<00:01:51.189> towards<00:01:52.179> the<00:01:52.329> end<00:01:52.509> so<00:01:53.259> again<00:01:53.530> that<00:01:53.770> all

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
on the towards the end so again that all

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.800 
on the towards the end so again that all
you<00:01:54.130> get<00:01:54.280> so<00:01:54.549> when<00:01:54.670> you<00:01:54.759> swing<00:01:55.030> and<00:01:55.329> make

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
you get so when you swing and make

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.899 
you get so when you swing and make
contact<00:01:56.350> all<00:01:56.530> that<00:01:56.679> energy<00:01:56.829> transfers<00:01:57.609> and

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
contact all that energy transfers and

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.940 
contact all that energy transfers and
keeps<00:01:58.600> it<00:01:58.780> down<00:01:58.960> into<00:01:59.170> the<00:01:59.380> barrel<00:01:59.560> into<00:01:59.770> the

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
keeps it down into the barrel into the

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.520 
keeps it down into the barrel into the
sweet<00:02:00.189> spot<00:02:00.460> so<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:00.939> Voodoo<00:02:01.780> weight<00:02:02.259> drops

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
sweet spot so the Voodoo weight drops

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.080 
sweet spot so the Voodoo weight drops
this<00:02:02.710> year<00:02:02.859> you're<00:02:03.009> gonna<00:02:03.100> have<00:02:03.249> a<00:02:03.280> minus<00:02:03.579> 3<00:02:03.880> a

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
this year you're gonna have a minus 3 a

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.649 
this year you're gonna have a minus 3 a
minus<00:02:04.479> 5<00:02:05.070> minus<00:02:06.070> 9<00:02:06.460> which<00:02:06.909> will<00:02:07.210> all<00:02:07.299> be<00:02:07.450> big

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
minus 5 minus 9 which will all be big
