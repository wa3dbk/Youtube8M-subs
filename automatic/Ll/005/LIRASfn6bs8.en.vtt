00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.800 

already<00:00:01.500> I<00:00:01.589> believe<00:00:02.070> that<00:00:02.460> the<00:00:02.730> average<00:00:03.240> miles

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
already I believe that the average miles

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.749 
already I believe that the average miles
per<00:00:04.110> gallon<00:00:04.500> this<00:00:04.620> thing<00:00:04.859> calculates<00:00:05.430> might

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
per gallon this thing calculates might

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.259 
per gallon this thing calculates might
be<00:00:05.910> crap<00:00:06.359> so<00:00:06.870> what<00:00:07.020> I'm<00:00:07.109> doing<00:00:07.140> is<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:08.160> have<00:00:09.120> it

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
be crap so what I'm doing is I have it

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.749 
be crap so what I'm doing is I have it
set<00:00:09.540> up<00:00:09.570> right<00:00:09.750> now<00:00:10.550> the<00:00:11.550> things<00:00:11.790> set<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.240> zero

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:13.759 
set up right now the things set to zero

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.490 
set up right now the things set to zero
and<00:00:14.759> of<00:00:14.849> course<00:00:15.089> average<00:00:15.599> miles<00:00:16.020> per<00:00:16.199> gallon

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
and of course average miles per gallon

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.640 
and of course average miles per gallon
right<00:00:16.619> now<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.310> zero<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:18.060> if<00:00:18.840> I<00:00:18.990> remember

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
right now is it zero and if I remember

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.420 
right now is it zero and if I remember
not<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:20.100> reset<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:21.300> trip<00:00:21.779> odometer<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:22.619> can

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
not to reset the trip odometer I can

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.900 
not to reset the trip odometer I can
then<00:00:23.580> calculate<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:25.010> true<00:00:26.010> miles<00:00:26.220> per<00:00:26.490> gallon

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
then calculate the true miles per gallon

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.169 
then calculate the true miles per gallon
by<00:00:27.470> taking<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.890> number<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.279> gallons<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:29.939> took

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
by taking the number of gallons it took

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.860 
by taking the number of gallons it took
to<00:00:30.359> fill<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.689> tank<00:00:32.870> versus<00:00:35.239> the<00:00:36.239> actual

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
to fill the tank versus the actual

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.000 
to fill the tank versus the actual
mileage<00:00:37.469> shown<00:00:38.100> here<00:00:38.340> on<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.579> trip<00:00:38.790> odometer

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
mileage shown here on the trip odometer

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.150 
mileage shown here on the trip odometer
so<00:00:41.809> next<00:00:42.809> video<00:00:43.050> hopefully<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.469> remember<00:00:43.920> all

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
so next video hopefully I remember all

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160 
so next video hopefully I remember all
that<00:00:44.370> stuff<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.059> we'll<00:00:45.390> get<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.629> calculation

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
that stuff and we'll get a calculation

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.720 
that stuff and we'll get a calculation
thereafter<00:00:48.260> here<00:00:49.260> are<00:00:49.379> 182<00:00:49.920> point<00:00:50.309> five<00:00:50.489> miles

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
thereafter here are 182 point five miles

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.110 
thereafter here are 182 point five miles
in<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.480> little<00:00:51.719> more<00:00:51.899> than<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.170> half<00:00:52.680> tank<00:00:53.280> I'm

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
in a little more than a half tank I'm

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.200 
in a little more than a half tank I'm
gonna<00:00:54.360> put<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:55.399> approximately<00:00:56.399> 20<00:00:56.699> bucks<00:00:56.879> at

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
gonna put in approximately 20 bucks at

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.000 
gonna put in approximately 20 bucks at
nine<00:00:57.570> hundred<00:00:57.780> percent<00:00:58.230> sure<00:00:58.260> there<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:58.980> a

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
nine hundred percent sure there is a

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.880 
nine hundred percent sure there is a
little<00:00:59.340> leeway<00:00:59.609> in<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:01.170> average<00:01:01.410> miles<00:01:01.649> per

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
little leeway in the average miles per

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.509 
little leeway in the average miles per
gallon<00:01:02.309> because<00:01:03.619> sometimes<00:01:04.619> at<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.489> same

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
gallon because sometimes at the same

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.240 
gallon because sometimes at the same
price<00:01:06.390> if<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:06.869> put<00:01:07.110> 20<00:01:07.409> bucks<00:01:07.439> in<00:01:07.830> where<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
price if I put 20 bucks in where the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.649 
price if I put 20 bucks in where the
needle<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:10.430> Wilson<00:01:11.430> actually<00:01:11.700> need<00:01:12.150> more<00:01:12.420> to

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
needle is I Wilson actually need more to

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.450 
needle is I Wilson actually need more to
completely<00:01:13.049> fill<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.680> other<00:01:13.860> times<00:01:14.159> when

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
completely fill it and other times when

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.300 
completely fill it and other times when
it's<00:01:14.610> actually<00:01:15.390> less<00:01:15.630> than<00:01:15.659> half-full<00:01:16.310> it

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
it's actually less than half-full it

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.920 
it's actually less than half-full it
won't<00:01:17.549> take<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.880> full<00:01:18.060> 20<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:18.659> there's<00:01:18.869> a

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
won't take the full 20 so there's a

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.999 
won't take the full 20 so there's a
little<00:01:19.110> slop<00:01:19.560> there<00:01:19.979> let's<00:01:20.939> find<00:01:21.270> out<00:01:21.890> what<00:01:22.890> it

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
little slop there let's find out what it

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.670 
little slop there let's find out what it
truly<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.840> now<00:01:24.840> according<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.380> our<00:01:25.439> little

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
truly is now according to our little

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.730 
truly is now according to our little
computer<00:01:26.869> or<00:01:27.869> averaging<00:01:28.460> 38.6<00:01:30.470> let's<00:01:31.470> see<00:01:31.619> how

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
computer or averaging 38.6 let's see how

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.310 
computer or averaging 38.6 let's see how
many<00:01:31.920> gallons<00:01:32.310> it'll<00:01:32.549> take<00:01:33.110> now<00:01:34.110> we'll

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
many gallons it'll take now we'll

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.929 
many gallons it'll take now we'll
calculate<00:01:34.650> this<00:01:35.189> all<00:01:35.430> at<00:01:35.850> home<00:01:37.729> alrighty<00:01:38.729> we

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
calculate this all at home alrighty we

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.359 
calculate this all at home alrighty we
got<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.150> pump<00:01:39.420> ready<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.869> go

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
got the pump ready to go

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.120 
got the pump ready to go
I<00:01:41.399> will<00:01:42.090> do<00:01:42.240> what<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.509> always<00:01:42.600> do<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:43.950> the

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
I will do what I always do is the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:54.319 
I will do what I always do is the
midpoint<00:01:50.450> I'm<00:01:51.450> going<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.689> do<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:53.329> midpoint

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
midpoint I'm going to do the midpoint

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.809 
midpoint I'm going to do the midpoint
paper<00:01:54.929> escape<00:01:55.500> where<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.009> get<00:01:56.429> rid<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.640> the

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
paper escape where I get rid of the

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:00.109 
paper escape where I get rid of the
excessive<00:01:57.600> paper<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:58.170> not<00:01:58.759> not<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.789> natural

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
excessive paper is not not the natural

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.020 
excessive paper is not not the natural
reaction<00:02:01.009> that's<00:02:02.009> how<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.189> get<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.459> true<00:02:02.789> full

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
reaction that's how you get a true full

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.179 
reaction that's how you get a true full
tank

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
tank

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.809 
tank
and<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.880> one<00:02:06.149> stopper<00:02:06.859> so<00:02:07.859> we<00:02:08.489> stopped

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
and this is a one stopper so we stopped

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.259 
and this is a one stopper so we stopped
at<00:02:09.000> one<00:02:09.830> now<00:02:10.830> stop<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.280> right<00:02:11.849> about<00:02:12.420> here<00:02:12.900> and

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
at one now stop it right about here and

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.500 
at one now stop it right about here and
what<00:02:15.269> I'll<00:02:15.480> do<00:02:16.310> is<00:02:17.310> let<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.640> vapors<00:02:17.879> escape

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
what I'll do is let the vapors escape

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.309 
what I'll do is let the vapors escape
for<00:02:18.780> 15<00:02:19.170> seconds<00:02:19.920> or<00:02:20.400> 10<00:02:20.989> alrighty<00:02:21.989> it's<00:02:22.080> now

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
for 15 seconds or 10 alrighty it's now

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.920 
for 15 seconds or 10 alrighty it's now
time<00:02:22.379> to<00:02:22.709> calculate<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:23.910> miles<00:02:24.120> per<00:02:24.420> gallon

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
time to calculate the miles per gallon

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.890 
time to calculate the miles per gallon
that<00:02:25.110> we<00:02:25.260> were<00:02:25.379> getting<00:02:25.560> in<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:26.280> trip<00:02:26.900> please

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
that we were getting in this trip please

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.130 
that we were getting in this trip please
note<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:28.260> I<00:02:28.440> did<00:02:28.860> abort<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.670> vapor<00:02:30.140> portion

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
note that I did abort the vapor portion

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.080 
note that I did abort the vapor portion
of<00:02:31.260> that<00:02:31.379> video<00:02:31.799> because<00:02:32.160> it<00:02:32.310> wasn't<00:02:32.819> really

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
of that video because it wasn't really

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.680 
of that video because it wasn't really
needed<00:02:33.680> when<00:02:34.680> you<00:02:34.799> drive<00:02:35.310> long<00:02:35.700> distances<00:02:35.730> and

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690

you<00:02:36.810> create<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.140> lot<00:02:37.379> of<00:02:37.500> heat<00:02:37.799> excessive

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
you create a lot of heat excessive

you create a lot of heat excessive
vapors<00:02:39.120> do<00:02:39.480> build<00:02:39.930> up<00:02:40.079> in<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.290> gas<00:02:40.470> tank<00:02:40.799> and

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
vapors do build up in a gas tank and

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
trick that does work and has been

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.509 
trick that does work and has been

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
verified by other people and that's how

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.130 
verified by other people and that's how
you<00:02:47.640> get<00:02:47.790> more<00:02:48.000> gas<00:02:48.239> in<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.450> tank<00:02:48.540> but<00:02:49.019> that

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
you get more gas in the tank but that

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.930 
you get more gas in the tank but that
wasn't<00:02:49.470> needed<00:02:49.769> in<00:02:49.860> this<00:02:50.040> case<00:02:50.310> as<00:02:50.459> I<00:02:50.579> said

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
wasn't needed in this case as I said

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.940 
wasn't needed in this case as I said
also<00:02:51.660> note<00:02:51.840> that<00:02:51.870> I'm<00:02:52.140> not<00:02:52.319> using<00:02:52.530> screen

file or - winds up fragmented which
usually<00:03:01.500> does<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.540> so<00:03:03.540> it<00:03:03.900> won't<00:03:04.230> really<00:03:04.500> work

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
usually does and so it won't really work

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.640 
usually does and so it won't really work
on<00:03:04.980> this<00:03:05.099> computer<00:03:05.810> so<00:03:06.810> we're<00:03:07.109> gonna<00:03:07.230> start

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
on this computer so we're gonna start

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.500 
on this computer so we're gonna start
with<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.220> amount<00:03:08.549> of<00:03:08.609> mileage<00:03:09.030> we've<00:03:09.239> done

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
with the amount of mileage we've done

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.190 
with the amount of mileage we've done
which<00:03:09.720> is<00:03:09.870> 182<00:03:10.200> 2.5<00:03:10.829> and<00:03:11.099> plus<00:03:11.579> I<00:03:11.870> used<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:12.989> real

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
which is 182 2.5 and plus I used a real

which is 182 2.5 and plus I used a real
calculator<00:03:13.859> not<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.280> Microsoft<00:03:14.790> one<00:03:15.030> so<00:03:15.870> I'm

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
calculator not the Microsoft one so I'm

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.589 
calculator not the Microsoft one so I'm
gonna<00:03:16.829> put<00:03:17.069> in<00:03:17.220> and<00:03:17.489> I'm<00:03:17.880> not<00:03:17.910> sure<00:03:18.389> if<00:03:18.480> I'm

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
gonna put in and I'm not sure if I'm

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.589 
gonna put in and I'm not sure if I'm
gonna<00:03:18.690> get<00:03:18.870> it<00:03:18.989> all<00:03:19.079> in<00:03:19.319> frame<00:03:19.799> on<00:03:20.040> 82.5<00:03:20.880> there

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
gonna get it all in frame on 82.5 there

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.530 
gonna get it all in frame on 82.5 there
we<00:03:21.750> go<00:03:21.930> we're<00:03:22.650> gonna<00:03:22.739> divide<00:03:23.430> that<00:03:23.489> by<00:03:24.180> the

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
we go we're gonna divide that by the

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.620 
we go we're gonna divide that by the
amount<00:03:24.930> of<00:03:25.290> gallons<00:03:25.560> we've<00:03:25.950> put<00:03:26.280> in<00:03:26.459> now<00:03:27.299> I

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
amount of gallons we've put in now I

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.920 
amount of gallons we've put in now I
gotta<00:03:28.340> figure<00:03:29.340> out<00:03:29.489> where<00:03:29.970> that<00:03:30.450> is<00:03:30.510> okay

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
gotta figure out where that is okay

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.120 
gotta figure out where that is okay
right<00:03:33.930> there<00:03:34.319> at<00:03:34.919> 1610<00:03:35.910> and<00:03:36.590> it's<00:03:37.590> really<00:03:37.889> hard

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
right there at 1610 and it's really hard

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.860 
right there at 1610 and it's really hard
to<00:03:38.310> see<00:03:38.519> I<00:03:38.549> don't<00:03:38.790> know<00:03:38.910> if<00:03:39.060> it's<00:03:39.209> showing<00:03:39.540> up
