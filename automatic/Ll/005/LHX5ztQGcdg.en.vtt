I<00:05:00.980> think<00:05:01.610> other<00:05:01.940> people<00:05:02.360> might<00:05:02.540> find<00:05:02.870> that

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
I think other people might find that

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.290 
I think other people might find that
hard<00:05:03.380> but<00:05:03.800> because<00:05:03.919> I've<00:05:04.250> had<00:05:04.280> epidemics<00:05:05.180> mom

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
hard but because I've had epidemics mom

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.790 
hard but because I've had epidemics mom
it's<00:05:05.450> not<00:05:05.630> any<00:05:05.840> better<00:05:06.050> than<00:05:06.290> anybody<00:05:06.530> else

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
it's not any better than anybody else

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.470 
it's not any better than anybody else
but<00:05:06.980> I've<00:05:07.100> had<00:05:07.280> it<00:05:07.400> happen<00:05:07.430> at<00:05:07.850> something<00:05:08.240> or

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
but I've had it happen at something or

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.270 
but I've had it happen at something or
another<00:05:08.570> so<00:05:09.290> I<00:05:09.320> know<00:05:09.410> I<00:05:09.560> get<00:05:09.830> somewhere<00:05:10.220> and

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
another so I know I get somewhere and

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.640 
another so I know I get somewhere and
get<00:05:10.790> how<00:05:10.970> to<00:05:11.030> get<00:05:11.270> funny<00:05:11.600> table<00:05:12.110> and<00:05:12.530> I<00:05:12.620> think
