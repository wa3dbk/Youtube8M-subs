00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.930
 it allows to feed the two toilets of the 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:10.740
 house with water network and islets of 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:16.260
 more clearly identified for this a 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:19.590
 double float system that allows 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.740
 to feed the washing machine with a 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:27.420
 double filtration and a tap of 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.689
 very convenient watering to water the 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.689
 plants 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.050
 here is a good quality water 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:45.329
 the tank is in a crawl space 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:50.250
 here it is about halfway up 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.469
 it is a cistern of 7 cubic meters 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.840
 gas station attendant 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:57.960
 it rests on a bed of sand of 10 cm 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.710
 here the arrival of water that comes from the look 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.410
 rainwater 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.140
 she comes here by the system of barter 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.070
 succulents a hose and to 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.560
 the other side 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.350
 laban that we do not see and the exit 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.830
 of water that feeds it will be seen two 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.040
 systems that powers the pump it's a 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.689
 more preferred booster pumps in 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.600
 stainless steel to avoid the phenomena of 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.830
 sinn rust it is set to two 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.630
 bars one night and as soon as the pressure 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.580
 falls below hambach and half gets 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.159
 get started 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.290
 this booster powers a collector 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:36.170
 with four outputs for 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:39.720
 watering the lawn here 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:44.090
 the feeding of the toilets of the machine to 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:47.490
 wash the other toilet on the floor here 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.180
 Robin's outdoor feeding 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.170
 outside that I will show you 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.500
 demonstration of operation as soon as 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.500
 I am worth 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.020
 a lot of us 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:13.280
 and plantations goes down below 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.280
 the bar 5 the pump gets under way 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.420
 arrived from the bar 5 in the room 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:37.090
 external power supply a sink to 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:42.040
 robin next door parking here is a single 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:44.110
 gravity feeding a view of the 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.440
 flexible wine can be based su 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:53.530
 sit on it is no problem 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:58.120
 the output here connect a dual system 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:01.990
 so here for the pump the booster 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:06.610
 with a check valve here is a 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:08.050
 swing valve for the outlet 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.960
 only gravity this clamshell 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.580
 pendulum allows to offer no 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:17.080
 resistance given that there is little 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:19.650
 pressure the double system of valves 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.000
 antiretour a spring or abel years ago 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.590
 when we allow a pau network 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:33.910
 empty and the other the pretty sound of water 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:38.800
 listen and finally to feed the tank 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:41.680
 so a double system of looks at the 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:45.790
 rainwater look here with the 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:50.470
 descent of one roof and the other 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:53.350
 Roof pan before release to sewer 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.270
 evacuation and everything in the bottom of strainer 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.570
 which corresponds to the entry into the other 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.580
 look at this look there with a system of 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:05.940
 double filter filter drawn from a 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.940
 aquarium stores and then here 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:15.620
 the entrance to the cistern which is located 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:17.239
 at about six meters away otherwise 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.670
 says when the tank is full on the 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:23.990
 level goes up and the level reaches everything 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:25.360
 naturally evacuation to the waters 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.800
 storm sewer 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.190
 this is how the system of 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.630
 springboard here I hope that you 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.400
 will help in your installation 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:38.800
 if you have questions you can 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:42.110
 join me at tirek's tools him 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:45.110
 orange.fr the cost of installation and 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:48.170
 1300 euros it takes a little less 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:51.010
 500 euros for the flexible tank at 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:55.160
 about 150 euros for the booster 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:59.360
 and then everything else for plumbing 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:01.850
 the valves the valves the pipes the 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.160
 fittings a good fitting system this 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.080
 are the fittings and slips with a 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.970
 small investment for 60 euros a 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.760
 box that allows you to report 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:13.390
 his slip ratios that's for 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.390
 finish the buzz
