hey<00:00:08.580> guys

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
hey guys

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.480 
hey guys
here's<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:09.599> tutorial<00:00:09.750> for<00:00:10.230> mine<00:00:10.620> reach<00:00:10.860> like

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
here's the tutorial for mine reach like

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.890 
here's the tutorial for mine reach like
I<00:00:11.610> said<00:00:11.790> in<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:11.910> performance<00:00:12.389> video<00:00:12.660> it's

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
I said in the performance video it's

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.990 
I said in the performance video it's
completely<00:00:13.590> impromptu<00:00:14.160> so<00:00:14.370> it<00:00:14.460> can<00:00:14.580> even<00:00:14.849> use

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
completely impromptu so it can even use

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.300 
completely impromptu so it can even use
a<00:00:15.030> borrowed<00:00:15.719> shuffled<00:00:16.170> deck<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.980> I<00:00:17.100> really

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
a borrowed shuffled deck and I really

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.310 
a borrowed shuffled deck and I really
like<00:00:17.460> this<00:00:17.609> effect<00:00:17.789> just<00:00:18.150> because<00:00:18.510> it's

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
like this effect just because it's

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.260 
like this effect just because it's
everything<00:00:20.039> appears<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.460> be<00:00:20.580> in<00:00:20.789> complete

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
everything appears to be in complete

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.810 
everything appears to be in complete
control<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.840> spectator<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:23.400> gets

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
control of the spectator and it gets

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.519 
control of the spectator and it gets
such<00:00:24.029> great<00:00:24.060> reactions<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.840> they<00:00:24.900> truly<00:00:25.289> will

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
such great reactions and they truly will

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.900 
such great reactions and they truly will
think<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:25.830> there's<00:00:26.070> some<00:00:26.220> sort<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.519> psychic

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
think that there's some sort of psychic

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.820 
think that there's some sort of psychic
which<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.720> course<00:00:27.960> they're<00:00:28.140> not<00:00:28.289> but<00:00:28.500> it's<00:00:28.619> ok

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
which of course they're not but it's ok

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.130 
which of course they're not but it's ok
to<00:00:28.890> let<00:00:29.010> them<00:00:29.189> believe<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.720> like<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:30.810> said<00:00:30.869> it's

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
to let them believe it like I said it's

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.200 
to let them believe it like I said it's
completely<00:00:31.260> impromptu<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.669> can<00:00:32.790> just<00:00:32.969> use

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
completely impromptu so you can just use

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.810 
completely impromptu so you can just use
any<00:00:33.750> random<00:00:34.620> deck<00:00:34.980> with<00:00:35.190> no<00:00:35.340> particular<00:00:35.520> order

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
any random deck with no particular order

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.270 
any random deck with no particular order
and<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.840> spectator<00:00:37.350> can<00:00:37.590> even<00:00:37.829> shuffle<00:00:38.190> that

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
and the spectator can even shuffle that

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.670 
and the spectator can even shuffle that
deck<00:00:38.899> usually<00:00:39.899> they<00:00:40.020> are<00:00:40.170> going<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.440> want<00:00:40.620> to

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
deck usually they are going to want to

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.170 
deck usually they are going to want to
shovel<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.219> it's<00:00:41.370> probably<00:00:41.760> actually<00:00:41.850> better

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
shovel and it's probably actually better

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.700 
shovel and it's probably actually better
if<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.480> let<00:00:42.750> them<00:00:42.899> shuffle<00:00:43.290> just<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.590> make

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
if you let them shuffle just to make

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.990 
if you let them shuffle just to make
sure<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.980> there's<00:00:44.219> absolutely<00:00:44.430> nothing

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
sure that there's absolutely nothing

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.389 
sure that there's absolutely nothing
tricky<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.780> could<00:00:45.960> be<00:00:46.050> doing<00:00:46.250> when<00:00:47.250> it

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
tricky that you could be doing when it

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.830 
tricky that you could be doing when it
you're<00:00:47.579> shuffling<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.090> deck<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.719> way

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
you're shuffling the deck this way

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.720 
you're shuffling the deck this way
everything<00:00:49.140> appears<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.680> be<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:50.160> complete

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
everything appears to be in complete

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.939 
everything appears to be in complete
control<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.300> spectator<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.710> after

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
control of the spectator so after

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.200 
control of the spectator so after
they're<00:00:53.100> satisfied<00:00:53.610> with<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.850> deck<00:00:54.030> being

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
they're satisfied with the deck being

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.229 
they're satisfied with the deck being
mixed<00:00:54.500> what<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.710> need<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.070> do<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.520> glimpse<00:00:57.059> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
mixed what you need to do is glimpse the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.750 
mixed what you need to do is glimpse the
bottom<00:00:57.539> card<00:00:57.780> because<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.739> effect<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.460> based

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
bottom card because this effect is based

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.970 
bottom card because this effect is based
on<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.329> key<00:01:00.510> card<00:01:00.719> principle<00:01:00.930> which<00:01:01.379> involves

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
on the key card principle which involves

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.579 
on the key card principle which involves
glimpsing<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.489> bottom<00:01:02.789> card<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.539> there's<00:01:04.530> a

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
glimpsing the bottom card and there's a

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.050 
glimpsing the bottom card and there's a
really<00:01:04.739> subtle<00:01:04.979> way<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.250> do<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:05.580> I'm<00:01:05.939> not

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
really subtle way to do this I'm not

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.460 
really subtle way to do this I'm not
exactly<00:01:06.270> sure<00:01:06.450> what<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.810> move<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.409> called

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
exactly sure what this move is called

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.289 
exactly sure what this move is called
but<00:01:07.890> all<00:01:08.340> you're<00:01:08.670> going<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.880> do<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.180> just

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
but all you're going to do is just

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.910 
but all you're going to do is just
simply<00:01:09.479> rotate<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.049> deck<00:01:10.290> like<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.650> and

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
simply rotate the deck like this and

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.890 
simply rotate the deck like this and
with<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.580> simple<00:01:11.820> rotation<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.600> know<00:01:12.659> that

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
with that simple rotation I know that

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.100 
with that simple rotation I know that
the<00:01:12.990> bottom<00:01:13.140> card<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.650> now<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.159> ten<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.460> Spades

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
the bottom card is now the ten of Spades

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.600 
the bottom card is now the ten of Spades
that's<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.320> all<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.590> do<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:16.950> simple<00:01:17.280> rotation

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
that's it all I do is simple rotation

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.399 
that's it all I do is simple rotation
glimpse<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.299> bottom<00:01:18.540> card<00:01:18.750> come<00:01:18.990> back<00:01:19.140> down

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
glimpse the bottom card come back down

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.320 
glimpse the bottom card come back down
it<00:01:19.890> looks<00:01:20.189> casual<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.939> doesn't<00:01:21.210> look<00:01:21.299> like

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
it looks casual it doesn't look like

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.330 
it looks casual it doesn't look like
you're<00:01:21.570> trying<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:22.080> memorize<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:23.040> bottom

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
you're trying to memorize the bottom

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.710 
you're trying to memorize the bottom
card<00:01:23.580> isn't<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:24.119> doesn't<00:01:24.240> look<00:01:24.479> like<00:01:24.509> you're

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
card isn't it doesn't look like you're

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.859 
card isn't it doesn't look like you're
doing<00:01:24.900> anything<00:01:25.020> suspicious<00:01:26.689> so<00:01:27.689> now<00:01:27.810> that

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
doing anything suspicious so now that

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.330 
doing anything suspicious so now that
you<00:01:28.080> have<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.290> bottom<00:01:28.619> card<00:01:28.860> memorized

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
you have the bottom card memorized

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.060 
you have the bottom card memorized
you're<00:01:30.030> going<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.329> spread<00:01:30.750> out<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.960> deck<00:01:31.320> just

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
you're going to spread out the deck just

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.770 
you're going to spread out the deck just
make<00:01:32.310> sure<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.610> keep<00:01:32.820> track<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.420> where<00:01:33.659> the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
make sure to keep track of where the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.210 
make sure to keep track of where the
bottom<00:01:34.049> card<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.590> can<00:01:34.740> spread<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.130> out

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
bottom card is you can spread it out

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.950 
bottom card is you can spread it out
however<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.700> like<00:01:35.939> as<00:01:36.390> long<00:01:36.630> as<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.840> know

however you like as long as you know
exactly<00:01:37.470> where<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.950> bottom<00:01:38.250> card<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.670> an

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
exactly where that bottom card is an

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.179 
exactly where that bottom card is an

you have the four selections mix them up

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.120 
you have the four selections mix them up
a<00:03:24.150> bit<00:03:24.299> because<00:03:24.480> they're<00:03:24.959> not<00:03:25.170> in<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.709> exact

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
a bit because they're not in the exact

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.770 
a bit because they're not in the exact
order<00:03:26.340> that<00:03:26.609> you<00:03:26.760> had<00:03:26.970> them<00:03:27.209> picked<00:03:27.450> so<00:03:27.660> that

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
order that you had them picked so that

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.360 
order that you had them picked so that
might<00:03:28.019> look<00:03:28.230> sort<00:03:28.470> of<00:03:28.530> suspicious<00:03:29.070> why<00:03:29.310> are

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
might look sort of suspicious why are

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.280 
might look sort of suspicious why are
they<00:03:29.549> out<00:03:29.579> of<00:03:29.850> order<00:03:30.150> so<00:03:30.600> kind<00:03:30.780> of<00:03:30.870> mix<00:03:31.019> them<00:03:31.200> up

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
they out of order so kind of mix them up

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.229 
they out of order so kind of mix them up
just<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.739> just<00:03:32.640> that<00:03:32.820> because<00:03:32.910> that<00:03:33.060> will<00:03:33.120> be

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
just to just that because that will be

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:34.310 
just to just that because that will be
your<00:03:33.269> explanation<00:03:33.780> of<00:03:33.870> why<00:03:33.989> they're<00:03:34.170> out<00:03:34.200> of

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
your explanation of why they're out of

your explanation of why they're out of
order<00:03:34.500> reveal<00:03:35.430> them<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:35.880> amazingly<00:03:36.299> we've

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
order reveal them and amazingly we've

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.990 
order reveal them and amazingly we've
always<00:03:36.780> selected<00:03:37.380> exactly<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.430> cards<00:03:38.790> that

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
always selected exactly the cards that

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.559 
always selected exactly the cards that
we<00:03:39.150> were<00:03:39.180> asked<00:03:39.930> to<00:03:39.959> so<00:03:40.200> we<00:03:40.290> must<00:03:40.440> be<00:03:40.530> psychic

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
we were asked to so we must be psychic

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.020 
we were asked to so we must be psychic
so<00:03:42.569> the<00:03:42.750> only<00:03:43.280> sort<00:03:44.280> of<00:03:44.400> trouble<00:03:44.790> you<00:03:44.880> could

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
so the only sort of trouble you could

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.640 
so the only sort of trouble you could
run<00:03:45.180> into<00:03:45.299> with<00:03:45.600> this<00:03:45.780> which<00:03:46.049> actually<00:03:46.530> it

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
run into with this which actually it

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.710 
run into with this which actually it
actually<00:03:47.400> improves<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:48.030> trick<00:03:48.209> is<00:03:48.359> not

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
actually improves the trick is not

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.569 
actually improves the trick is not
really<00:03:48.959> a<00:03:48.989> trouble<00:03:49.350> at<00:03:49.440> all<00:03:49.560> is<00:03:50.069> what<00:03:50.130> if<00:03:50.459> the

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
really a trouble at all is what if the

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.400 
really a trouble at all is what if the
spectator<00:03:51.060> happens<00:03:51.420> to<00:03:51.569> pick<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:52.049> bottom

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
spectator happens to pick the bottom

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.559 
spectator happens to pick the bottom
card<00:03:52.680> before<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.760> magician<00:03:54.090> get<00:03:54.239> the<00:03:54.329> chance

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
card before the magician get the chance

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.830 
card before the magician get the chance
to<00:03:54.660> do<00:03:54.810> so<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.769> bottom<00:03:56.010> part<00:03:56.040> of<00:03:56.310> tennis<00:03:56.549> fades

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
to do so the bottom part of tennis fades

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.240 
to do so the bottom part of tennis fades
so<00:03:57.840> let's<00:03:58.019> say<00:03:58.170> that<00:03:58.200> I<00:03:58.380> tell<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.100> spectator

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
the cards right and again you didn't

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.510 
the cards right and again you didn't
have<00:04:39.840> to<00:04:39.930> do<00:04:40.050> anything<00:04:40.590> and<00:04:40.770> they<00:04:41.130> pick<00:04:41.370> the

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
have to do anything and they pick the

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.080 
have to do anything and they pick the
cards<00:04:41.940> then<00:04:42.479> they<00:04:42.630> pick<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:43.050> cards<00:04:43.320> right

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.670 
cards then they pick the cards right
and<00:04:45.090> that's<00:04:45.300> actually<00:04:45.479> improves<00:04:46.290> the<00:04:46.500> trick

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
and that's actually improves the trick

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.440 
and that's actually improves the trick
it's<00:04:46.830> even<00:04:47.040> better<00:04:47.310> if<00:04:47.550> that<00:04:47.580> happens<00:04:48.120> because

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
it's even better if that happens because

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.180 
it's even better if that happens because
you<00:04:48.810> truly<00:04:49.260> didn't<00:04:49.440> have<00:04:49.560> to<00:04:49.620> do<00:04:49.740> anything<00:04:49.950> and

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
you truly didn't have to do anything and

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.860 
you truly didn't have to do anything and
they<00:04:50.280> just<00:04:50.520> happen<00:04:50.820> to<00:04:50.850> pick<00:04:51.389> the<00:04:51.540> suck<00:04:51.720> of

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
they just happen to pick the suck of

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.710 
they just happen to pick the suck of
cards<00:04:52.200> so<00:04:52.860> uh<00:04:52.889> yeah<00:04:53.850> that's<00:04:54.060> pretty<00:04:54.240> much<00:04:54.360> it

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790
