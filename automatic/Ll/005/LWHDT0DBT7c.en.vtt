00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.000
 Hello 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.230
 We are here today to talk about 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.639
 the benefits of male castration 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.340
 initially it is important to remember that 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.160
 besides improving the behavior of 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.130
 marking the territory from where even 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.490
 of aggression is good also the people 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.460
 remember the prevention of diseases 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.039
 tumor of the testis 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.710
 prostate as a result of all this 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.920
 often a 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.579
 hernia is what we call inguinal 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.809
 This is the one he is 14 years old and he does not 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.840
 was castrated 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.210
 up to the moment he presents all these 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:53.239
 changes that I just told you to 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:57.000
 you are he has the testicle here already 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:59.699
 decreased hardened one testicle 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.690
 right is different from the testicle 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.420
 left 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.760
 they are different inconsistency and 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.460
 also in size 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.360
 in contrast I also note the 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.479
 increase the volume of the years here what 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.549
 characterized enlargement of the prostate that 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.119
 people call it fra persuasive 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:25.340
 benign prostatic 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:28.710
 it also has an increase in volume 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.869
 I do not know if I can do this exactly 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.840
 region 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:37.170
 this region and the inguinal ring region 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.729
 due to the size of the prostate as it 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:44.340
 greatly increased because love ends 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.840
 pushing the structures wanting us to 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:54.540
 we have here in the abdomen and ends up paying is 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:56.700
 this hernia treatment even now with 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.840
 all these changes still to 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.350
 surgical 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.689
 then the idea is to do what to castrate with 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.479
 castration we will solve the 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.310
 not only the problem of the testicular tumor 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.860
 because that testicle it comes out 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.040
 but we can also solve the problem 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.110
 prostate problem 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.359
 this proposal will stop receiving 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.140
 testicle hormone 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:23.290
 this ring it tends to decrease these 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.590
 structures go back to the 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.810
 and the next one goes down so it's important 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.750
 remember that it is always good to make a 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.510
 regular visit to the veterinarian 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.159
 you are and still be aware if your 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.010
 animal is not castrated 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:42.379
 You always have to be touching him and 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.470
 checking if you have any type of 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:47.540
 change in case of doubt always good 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.879
 look for a veterinarian for 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.549
 professional capacity 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:56.349
 able to be able to take their 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.349
 doubts stay tuned
