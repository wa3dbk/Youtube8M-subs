00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.830 
as a functionality I think the one of
the<00:01:44.490> biggest<00:01:44.640> things<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:45.090> learned<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.570> it's

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
the biggest things I learned is it's

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.389 
the biggest things I learned is it's
kind<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.049> pointless<00:01:46.259> if<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:46.829> teach<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.220> kids

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
kind of pointless if you teach the kids

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.069 
kind of pointless if you teach the kids
the<00:01:47.490> technique<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.090> they<00:01:48.509> can't<00:01:48.720> really<00:01:48.840> do

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
the technique and they can't really do

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:49.720 
the technique and they can't really do
it<00:01:49.110> in<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.409> game

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 
it in the game

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.610 
it in the game
so<00:01:49.910> the<00:01:50.390> biggest<00:01:50.600> thing<00:01:50.810> you<00:01:50.990> know<00:01:51.110> I<00:01:51.290> learned

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
so the biggest thing you know I learned

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.470 
so the biggest thing you know I learned
from<00:01:51.770> this<00:01:51.980> is<00:01:52.250> technique<00:01:52.880> is<00:01:53.000> very<00:01:53.030> very

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
from this is technique is very very

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.390 
from this is technique is very very
important<00:01:53.990> I<00:01:54.050> think<00:01:54.110> but<00:01:54.740> it's<00:01:54.890> also<00:01:55.130> very

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
important I think but it's also very

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.860 
important I think but it's also very
important<00:01:55.850> to<00:01:55.880> put<00:01:56.030> them<00:01:56.150> in<00:01:56.240> game<00:01:56.390> scenarios

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870 
important to put them in game scenarios

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.300 
important to put them in game scenarios
where<00:01:57.110> they<00:01:57.170> have<00:01:57.320> that<00:01:57.470> pressure<00:01:57.710> so<00:01:58.220> they

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
where they have that pressure so they

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.850 
where they have that pressure so they
can<00:01:58.460> perform<00:01:58.580> in<00:01:58.850> the<00:01:58.880> game<00:01:59.500> awesome<00:02:00.500> answers

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
can perform in the game awesome answers

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.230 
can perform in the game awesome answers
um<00:02:01.550> how<00:02:02.360> are<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:02.630> instructors<00:02:03.110> this<00:02:03.380> weekend

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
part you know you got three different

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.700 
part you know you got three different

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
instructors all three have something

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.800 
instructors all three have something
different<00:02:10.100> that<00:02:10.430> they<00:02:10.550> provide<00:02:10.970> you<00:02:11.630> know<00:02:11.660> you

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810

the<00:02:34.100> way<00:02:34.190> these<00:02:34.370> guys<00:02:34.580> think<00:02:34.970> and<00:02:35.270> react<00:02:35.600> I

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
mean specifically the way they look at

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.440 
mean specifically the way they look at
soccer<00:02:39.410> the<00:02:39.860> more<00:02:40.100> holistic<00:02:40.400> approach<00:02:41.000> you

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
soccer the more holistic approach you

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.630 
soccer the more holistic approach you
know<00:02:41.570> it's<00:02:41.720> more<00:02:41.930> than<00:02:41.990> just<00:02:42.170> a<00:02:42.350> ball<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:42.950> 22

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
know it's more than just a ball and 22

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.990 
know it's more than just a ball and 22
guys<00:02:44.290> so<00:02:45.290> much<00:02:45.350> that<00:02:45.650> goes<00:02:45.680> into<00:02:45.830> it<00:02:46.160> yeah

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000

guys so much that goes into it yeah
absolutely<00:02:47.180> and<00:02:47.630> I<00:02:47.720> think<00:02:47.750> it's<00:02:48.050> cool<00:02:48.200> that<00:02:48.260> we

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
absolutely and I think it's cool that we

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.470 
absolutely and I think it's cool that we
can<00:02:48.470> relate<00:02:48.860> to<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:49.100> guys<00:02:49.250> too<00:02:49.550> i<00:02:49.580> think<00:02:49.730> is<00:02:50.330> on

one of the first days when James was

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.949 
one of the first days when James was
talking<00:02:52.580> about<00:02:52.820> he<00:02:53.180> took<00:02:53.480> his<00:02:53.570> first<00:02:53.720> seed

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959

licenses<00:03:08.930> and<00:03:09.410> it's<00:03:09.560> also<00:03:09.680> very<00:03:09.920> nice<00:03:10.160> to<00:03:10.310> see

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
licenses and it's also very nice to see

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.430 
licenses and it's also very nice to see
that<00:03:10.640> they<00:03:10.730> take<00:03:10.910> time<00:03:11.180> out<00:03:11.209> to<00:03:11.600> come<00:03:11.989> back<00:03:12.230> and

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
that they take time out to come back and

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.660 
that they take time out to come back and
teach<00:03:12.530> other<00:03:12.770> coaches<00:03:13.190> I<00:03:13.280> think<00:03:13.459> that's<00:03:13.580> very

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
teach other coaches I think that's very

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.760 
teach other coaches I think that's very
important<00:03:14.420> for<00:03:14.600> the<00:03:15.080> youth<00:03:15.230> soccer<00:03:15.470> and

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
important for the youth soccer and

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.290 
important for the youth soccer and
probably<00:03:16.010> American<00:03:16.370> soccer<00:03:16.580> in<00:03:16.790> general<00:03:17.150> for

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
probably American soccer in general for

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.970 
probably American soccer in general for
them<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:17.570> make<00:03:17.930> better<00:03:17.989> coaches<00:03:18.620> in<00:03:18.739> order<00:03:18.920> to

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
them to make better coaches in order to

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.560 
them to make better coaches in order to
make<00:03:19.130> a<00:03:19.160> better<00:03:19.400> national<00:03:19.790> team<00:03:19.940> play<00:03:20.180> and<00:03:20.360> I

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
make a better national team play and I

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.210 
make a better national team play and I
think<00:03:20.750> their<00:03:20.870> attitude<00:03:21.410> is<00:03:21.560> what<00:03:21.800> makes<00:03:21.860> this

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
think their attitude is what makes this

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.770 
think their attitude is what makes this
key<00:03:22.459> because<00:03:22.790> they<00:03:22.910> don't<00:03:23.300> come<00:03:23.450> out<00:03:23.480> here

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
key because they don't come out here

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.150 
key because they don't come out here
telling<00:03:24.020> you<00:03:24.200> what<00:03:24.410> to<00:03:24.530> do<00:03:24.680> they<00:03:24.860> come<00:03:25.040> out

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
telling you what to do they come out

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.820 
telling you what to do they come out

they'll let you know but not in a

they'll let you know but not in a

negative way it's to make you better as

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.229

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
mean and sometimes they're a little bit

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:37.750

harder<00:03:36.800> new<00:03:36.890> in<00:03:37.010> their<00:03:37.100> practice<00:03:37.220> sessions

but they want you to succeed i feel like

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.960 
but they want you to succeed i feel like
they<00:03:40.010> know<00:03:40.250> that<00:03:40.400> it's<00:03:40.520> better<00:03:40.730> they're

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
they know that it's better they're

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.970
