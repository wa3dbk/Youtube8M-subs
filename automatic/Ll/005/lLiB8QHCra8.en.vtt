00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.810 
to no recoil it shoots dead straight and
if<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.259> take<00:01:37.409> rapid<00:01:37.829> fire<00:01:37.979> off<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.640> which

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
if you take rapid fire off of it which

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.399 
if you take rapid fire off of it which
you<00:01:39.060> can<00:01:39.299> do<00:01:39.509> but<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.720> prefer<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.020> have<00:01:40.140> rapid

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
you can do but I prefer to have rapid

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.020 
you can do but I prefer to have rapid
fire<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.799> just<00:01:41.460> because<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.759> just

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
fire on it just because it just

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.330 
fire on it just because it just
absolutely<00:01:42.600> shreds<00:01:43.020> kids<00:01:43.350> but<00:01:43.590> if<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.159> take

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
absolutely shreds kids but if you take

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.160 
absolutely shreds kids but if you take
rapid<00:01:44.700> fire<00:01:44.850> off<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.570> just<00:01:45.659> put<00:01:45.899> grip

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
rapid fire off of it and just put grip

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.210 
on the k5 genuine it has zero recoil it
is<00:01:50.009> dead<00:01:50.310> accurate<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.240> laser<00:01:51.689> beam<00:01:52.220> it

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
warfare if you put grip on the k5

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.889 
warfare if you put grip on the k5
genuine<00:01:59.189> so<00:01:59.399> which<00:02:00.030> makes<00:02:00.270> us<00:02:00.390> gun<00:02:00.509> awesome

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899

because<00:02:01.020> then<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.320> can<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.950> know<00:02:02.040> use<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.399> at

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
because then you can you know use it at

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.069 
because then you can you know use it at
close<00:02:02.759> range<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.210> since<00:02:03.390> it's<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.570> submachine

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
close range of since it's a submachine

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.870 
close range of since it's a submachine
gun<00:02:04.259> with<00:02:04.649> additional<00:02:05.070> damage<00:02:05.520> it'll<00:02:05.729> be<00:02:05.850> a

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
gun with additional damage it'll be a

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.999 
gun with additional damage it'll be a
beast<00:02:06.210> at<00:02:06.450> close<00:02:06.659> range<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.320> then<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.530> crazy

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
beast at close range and then the crazy

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.160 
beast at close range and then the crazy
accuracy<00:02:08.670> makes<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:08.970> amazing<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.479> have<00:02:09.810> medium

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170

compete with about twenty seventh and
all

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
all

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.530 
all
those<00:02:13.620> other<00:02:13.770> great<00:02:14.100> guns<00:02:14.370> but<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:15.360> gameplay

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540

I'm actually using grip and rapid fire

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.470 
I'm actually using grip and rapid fire
I'll<00:02:17.430> actually<00:02:17.700> put<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:17.910> class<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.270> upon

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480
