guide

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.930 
guide
I<00:00:51.199> think<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.289> ice<00:00:52.410> cream<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:53.010> better<00:00:53.219> honestly

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
I think the ice cream is better honestly

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.610 
I think the ice cream is better honestly
just<00:00:54.210> because<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.660> two<00:00:55.050> scoops<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.440> weird

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
just because the two scoops is weird

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.990 
just because the two scoops is weird
you'll<00:00:56.039> see<00:00:56.250> you'll<00:00:56.520> see<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.730> next<00:00:56.940> episode

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
you'll see you'll see you next episode

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.450 
you'll see you'll see you next episode
but<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.390> two<00:00:57.570> scoops<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.079> weird<00:00:58.320> but<00:00:59.039> anyway

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
but the two scoops is weird but anyway

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.029 
but the two scoops is weird but anyway

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
a gun that made ice cream truck sounds

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.139 
a gun that made ice cream truck sounds
or<00:01:45.090> something<00:01:45.390> but<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.630> never<00:01:46.259> never<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:47.149> never

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
thought that I wouldn't play it could be

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.710 
thought that I wouldn't play it could be
bugged<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.670> don't<00:01:50.850> know<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.119> lot<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.420> stuff<00:01:51.630> in

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
bugged I don't know a lot of stuff in

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.980 
bugged I don't know a lot of stuff in
this<00:01:51.780> game<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:52.110> bugged<00:01:52.320> but<00:01:52.470> anyway<00:01:52.680> um

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
this game is bugged but anyway um

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.600 
this game is bugged but anyway um
getting<00:01:54.990> into<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.259> gameplay<00:01:55.680> here<00:01:55.890> it's

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
getting into the gameplay here it's

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.539 
getting into the gameplay here it's
really<00:01:56.939> like<00:01:57.810> inaccurate<00:01:58.530> hipfiring<00:01:59.009> you

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
really like inaccurate hipfiring you

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.740 
really like inaccurate hipfiring you
have<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.759> get<00:01:59.880> like<00:02:00.000> right<00:02:00.210> up<00:02:00.329> in<00:02:00.420> their<00:02:00.540> face

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
have to get like right up in their face

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.149 
have to get like right up in their face
I<00:02:00.930> mean<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.140> accuracy<00:02:01.439> on<00:02:01.469> isn't<00:02:01.829> too<00:02:02.009> bad

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
I mean the accuracy on isn't too bad

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.520 
I mean the accuracy on isn't too bad
it's<00:02:02.369> like<00:02:02.460> over<00:02:02.759> 80<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.540> it's<00:02:03.869> not<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.290> bad

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
it's like over 80 so it's not that bad

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.880 
it's like over 80 so it's not that bad
but<00:02:04.909> it<00:02:05.909> freezes<00:02:06.390> them<00:02:06.540> really<00:02:07.110> quickly<00:02:07.680> which

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
but it freezes them really quickly which

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.880 
but it freezes them really quickly which
is<00:02:07.920> which<00:02:08.789> is<00:02:08.970> nice<00:02:09.289> plus<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.470> get<00:02:10.709> those

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
is which is nice plus you get those

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.370 
is which is nice plus you get those
crits<00:02:11.190> on<00:02:11.370> them<00:02:11.550> after<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:12.060> freeze<00:02:12.450> them

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
crits on them after you freeze them

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.510 
crits on them after you freeze them
unless<00:02:13.650> you're<00:02:13.800> aiming<00:02:14.010> down<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.160> sights

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
unless you're aiming down the sights

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.830 
unless you're aiming down the sights
like<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:14.850> am<00:02:14.970> right<00:02:15.180> here<00:02:15.270> even<00:02:15.570> then<00:02:15.690> it's

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
like I am right here even then it's

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.020 
like I am right here even then it's
still<00:02:15.960> hard<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.290> hit<00:02:16.440> it<00:02:16.800> I<00:02:17.190> guess<00:02:17.430> it's<00:02:17.610> just<00:02:17.670> a

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
still hard to hit it I guess it's just a

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.420 
still hard to hit it I guess it's just a
mini<00:02:18.420> guns<00:02:18.660> nature<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.530> no<00:02:19.680> sight<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.190> make<00:02:20.280> it

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
mini guns nature and no sight to make it

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.910 
mini guns nature and no sight to make it
more<00:02:20.580> accurate<00:02:21.030> so<00:02:21.210> so<00:02:22.050> that's<00:02:22.230> that's<00:02:22.440> not

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
more accurate so so that's that's not

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.070 
more accurate so so that's that's not
exactly<00:02:23.250> cool<00:02:23.640> but<00:02:23.940> it<00:02:24.060> does<00:02:24.390> kind<00:02:24.660> of<00:02:24.780> get<00:02:24.930> the

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
exactly cool but it does kind of get the

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.080 
exactly cool but it does kind of get the
job<00:02:25.350> done<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:25.800> mean<00:02:25.920> it<00:02:26.040> freezes<00:02:26.430> quickly<00:02:26.820> and

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
job done I mean it freezes quickly and

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.030 
job done I mean it freezes quickly and
it<00:02:27.210> it<00:02:27.540> does<00:02:27.840> if<00:02:28.260> you<00:02:28.320> hit<00:02:28.590> all<00:02:28.710> your<00:02:28.860> bullets

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
it it does if you hit all your bullets

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
it it does if you hit all your bullets
that<00:02:29.250> doesn't<00:02:29.460> considerable<00:02:29.850> amount<00:02:30.030> of

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
that doesn't considerable amount of

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.790 
that doesn't considerable amount of
damage<00:02:30.330> it's<00:02:30.480> not<00:02:30.570> a<00:02:30.600> bad<00:02:30.930> gun<00:02:31.200> by<00:02:31.440> any<00:02:31.590> stretch

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
damage it's not a bad gun by any stretch

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.850 
damage it's not a bad gun by any stretch
of<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.040> imagination<00:02:32.850> but<00:02:33.480> I<00:02:33.900> know<00:02:34.530> what<00:02:34.680> made

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
of the imagination but I know what made

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.650 
of the imagination but I know what made
this<00:02:35.010> gun<00:02:35.220> special<00:02:35.460> supposably<00:02:36.150> was<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.480> fact

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
this gun special supposably was the fact

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.470 
this gun special supposably was the fact
that<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.870> made<00:02:37.100> it<00:02:38.100> made<00:02:38.250> timing<00:02:38.760> sounds<00:02:39.240> it

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
that it made it made timing sounds it

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
you just get while you're leveling up

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.290 
you just get while you're leveling up
because<00:04:49.680> endgame<00:04:50.070> it's<00:04:50.280> not<00:04:50.430> really<00:04:50.610> gonna<00:04:50.730> do

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
because endgame it's not really gonna do

because endgame it's not really gonna do
too<00:04:51.450> much<00:04:51.570> for<00:04:51.840> you<00:04:51.960> I<00:04:52.139> mean<00:04:52.710> again<00:04:53.040> when<00:04:53.250> you

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
too much for you I mean again when you

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.310 
too much for you I mean again when you
aim<00:04:53.550> down<00:04:53.700> the<00:04:53.760> sights<00:04:53.880> it's<00:04:54.480> really<00:04:54.960> really

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
aim down the sights it's really really

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.200 
aim down the sights it's really really
powerful<00:04:55.800> just<00:04:56.400> because<00:04:56.610> of<00:04:56.700> the<00:04:56.760> fire<00:04:56.970> rate

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
powerful just because of the fire rate

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.390 
powerful just because of the fire rate
and<00:04:57.300> of<00:04:58.169> course<00:04:58.410> cryo<00:04:58.710> is<00:04:58.950> resisted<00:04:59.370> by

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
and of course cryo is resisted by

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.040
