00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.620
 passionate that you get to that 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.870
 because it is that the flower 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.080
 of the passion flower has 12 petal 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.080
 and it is said that one can see the two seasons of the passion of Christ 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.050
 in those 12 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.110
 in those 70 liters that the flower has 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.730
 and there comes the term as such if we start as such start 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.790

 that apply some 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.080
 so they can see how it is inside 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.410
 hard as you may have noticed it has cost 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.580
 cut it and there is therefore justly 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.460
 the pulp as such 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.680
 in fact when one fights and leaves only the party is talking about that 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.540
 it's supposed to be inedible 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.100
 there are people who have attracted an investor and a very popular dessert that is more

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.530
 bare 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.680
 so we took a bit of the leader team in seeing perfectly 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.050
 I have chosen to its natural state before 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.080

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.350
 that in them there are not some regions 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.780
 the classic is free 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.630
 and we apply ourselves very chiquitico 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.630
 1 we send from a group to 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:14.019

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:25.409
 there is an old 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:26.439
 maximum 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:29.869
 that works and is that everything that this one seemed a lot to fatten them 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.089
 the butter really is great 

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:34.630
 I'm going to the kitchen 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:35.590
 so in him 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.590

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.199
 onion 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:43.339
 but I have to have previously applied 

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:44.610
 this has to be courteous 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.610
 extremely delicate because we can arrange the sauce more than anything for 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.449
 give him 

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:49.999

 I have a pact 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:01.179
 We were going to last a little 

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:02.340
 handcuffed 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.499

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:13.539
 we would live as it is said that a person palate adedy and without more 

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:16.539

 you want the onion condoro the kitchen at low heat 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.330
 in butter with butter once we've done that 

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:26.249

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:29.819
 the pulp itself of the parkita I will not keep calling 

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:33.429

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.069
 this kind of stir-fry 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.069
 It is classic where the use of salt is shared with the mind 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:44.720
 a blow dried 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.999
 and we are going to add 

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:46.880
 see here 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.909
 a little sugar 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:51.010
 it's quite like that in the real 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.829
 the match 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.829
 I'm going to inherit heras from assaf arango 

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:56.989

 yes lamented 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.649
 and some sherry 

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:16.749
 monarch irene that cook a good time thing that can develop well the 

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:17.509
 sauce 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:19.129
 comes out to the pulp 

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:22.550
 played the aroma of truly a wonder 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.419
 appointment of the sauce k 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.129
 geoana that develops fire an excellent very high so that it does not go to 

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:29.300
 to call 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.900
 until the time comes to sift the 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.499
 solar the subsequently 

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:38.719
 how I told that to accompany a fish in this case it's a snapper that I 

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:39.570
 by way of 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:40.880
 company look for it 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.000
 but I took liberty by how and apart from having previously filleted 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.870
 have removed it in the skin 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.540
 but they are clear why in a country full of aguascalientes for example 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.159
 we can gunsmith we can guns archer luce multiple fish 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:56.370
 I could use 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.389
 the important thing is that it is 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:02.550
 of a long steak like this one that I have here that you will do with a 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.180
 small knife a lace was going to be a small incision 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.100
 it went down less 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.400
 I see them from the tip 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.840
 just as in what I'm doing as the knife was going to repeat the 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.150
 operation that I am 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.770
 making Persian that they fear that at the other end they find two fingers of the 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.129
 tip 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:25.120
 makes an incision on this fish president that I have here previously 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.219
 I keep 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:29.499
 shortly after the secret of why we are making that couple of decisions 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.229
 for him he commented now what is coming 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:37.039
 of the panhard totoral powder from a bus of different types of mushrooms to be 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:37.610

 i a little dust 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:56.050
 that I have here of another one in this case it is about portovelo 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.970
 or simply by the eyes very simple to do 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.790
 you grab me for example longo in question 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.450
 in this case small portovelo 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.550
 and place it on a baking tray at 100 degrees felt for one hour and 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.779
 he is going to dry be it says full field 

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:11.180

 um breaded place of bread allegedly wonderful 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:22.180
 put him 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.180
 to this agreement we are a little salt 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.000
 which is easier and then how are we going to impale we have here 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.439
 egg white 

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:33.879
 without beating

 we can with a little more salt to the state as such 

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:39.389
 do not be afraid of the zal boys that is 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:40.130
 lately 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.130
 it is a furious attack against salt 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.249
 we fill town 

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:47.919
 with that egg white 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:51.870
 in such a way that we can now completely protect it 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.050
 on this mushroom pole 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.529

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.400
 to see something that few people know well 

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:08.960
 they are planted makes case
