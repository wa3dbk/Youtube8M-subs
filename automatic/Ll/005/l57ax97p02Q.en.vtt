an<00:00:12.870> overflow<00:00:13.530> pipe<00:00:14.330> that<00:00:15.330> we<00:00:15.540> pump<00:00:15.809> which<00:00:16.109> is

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
an overflow pipe that we pump which is

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.589 
an overflow pipe that we pump which is
one<00:00:16.409> of<00:00:16.499> the<00:00:16.619> moments<00:00:16.890> but<00:00:17.640> now<00:00:17.999> decided<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.449> go

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:18.599 
one of the moments but now decided to go

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:20.389 
one of the moments but now decided to go
for<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.900> simple<00:00:19.140> tank<00:00:19.439> which<00:00:19.619> is<00:00:19.739> the<00:00:19.859> same<00:00:20.069> size

00:00:20.389 --> 00:00:20.399 
for a simple tank which is the same size

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:23.269 
for a simple tank which is the same size
as<00:00:21.029> my<00:00:21.359> actual<00:00:21.480> fish<00:00:21.810> tank<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.979> reason<00:00:23.220> I

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
as my actual fish tank the reason I

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.620 
as my actual fish tank the reason I
chose<00:00:23.489> this<00:00:23.669> was<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.119> fact<00:00:24.329> that<00:00:24.359> if<00:00:24.509> I

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
chose this was the fact that if I

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.599 
chose this was the fact that if I
suddenly<00:00:24.839> decide<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.499> want<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.800> stick<00:00:26.460> another

suddenly decide I want to stick another
tank<00:00:27.269> when<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:27.509> would<00:00:27.659> grab<00:00:27.839> it<00:00:27.989> on<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.169> side

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:28.409 
tank when I would grab it on the side

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:30.019 
tank when I would grab it on the side
here<00:00:28.439> I've<00:00:28.710> got<00:00:28.859> plenty<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.220> sump<00:00:29.489> tank<00:00:29.669> space

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
here I've got plenty of sump tank space

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.359 
here I've got plenty of sump tank space
I<00:00:30.359> play<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.899> funny<00:00:31.259> wall<00:00:31.529> consumption<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.189> can

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
I play a funny wall consumption I can

00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:38.039 
grab it at top and now got in my media

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:41.509 
grab it at top and now got in my media
garden<00:00:38.640> bell<00:00:39.449> siphons<00:00:39.929> in<00:00:40.050> there<00:00:40.289> and<00:00:40.980> this<00:00:41.370> is

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:41.519 
garden bell siphons in there and this is

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:43.759 
garden bell siphons in there and this is
actually<00:00:41.850> my<00:00:42.000> first<00:00:42.300> official<00:00:42.780> test<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.530> see

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:43.769 
actually my first official test to see

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:45.979 
actually my first official test to see
if<00:00:44.039> the<00:00:44.550> whole<00:00:44.699> thing<00:00:44.999> will<00:00:45.239> drain<00:00:45.809> off

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
if the whole thing will drain off

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.459 
if the whole thing will drain off
completely<00:00:46.579> I<00:00:47.629> did<00:00:48.629> have<00:00:48.749> a<00:00:48.780> go<00:00:49.019> yesterday

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
completely I did have a go yesterday

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.790 
completely I did have a go yesterday
because<00:00:50.249> originally<00:00:50.519> I<00:00:51.030> had<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:52.260> as<00:00:52.559> my

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
because originally I had this as my

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.250 
because originally I had this as my
overflow<00:00:53.159> valve<00:00:53.460> which<00:00:54.089> went<00:00:54.570> into<00:00:54.749> there<00:00:54.929> but

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
overflow valve which went into there but

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.950 
overflow valve which went into there but
it<00:00:56.010> just<00:00:56.339> it<00:00:56.670> wasn't<00:00:56.909> flowing<00:00:57.359> quick<00:00:57.719> enough

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
it just it wasn't flowing quick enough

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.930 
it just it wasn't flowing quick enough
the<00:00:58.199> bell<00:00:58.649> siphon<00:00:58.920> was<00:00:59.309> actually<00:00:59.609> draining

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
the bell siphon was actually draining

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.299 
the bell siphon was actually draining
off<00:01:00.120> quicker<00:01:00.449> than<00:01:00.749> the<00:01:01.409> overflow<00:01:01.829> bow<00:01:02.069> could

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
off quicker than the overflow bow could

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.860 
off quicker than the overflow bow could
actually<00:01:02.429> get<00:01:02.670> rid<00:01:02.819> of<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.999> water<00:01:03.179> so<00:01:03.569> I've

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
actually get rid of the water so I've

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.090 
actually get rid of the water so I've
now<00:01:04.019> decided<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.530> go<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:05.579> a<00:01:05.610> full<00:01:05.909> female<00:01:06.210> pipe

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
now decided to go to a full female pipe

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.300 
now decided to go to a full female pipe
so<00:01:08.100> any<00:01:08.790> luck<00:01:09.290> so<00:01:10.290> yeah<00:01:10.590> I'm<00:01:10.740> going<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.950> tidy<00:01:11.189> up

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
so any luck so yeah I'm going to tidy up

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.580 
so any luck so yeah I'm going to tidy up
all<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.640> pipe<00:01:11.850> work<00:01:12.060> once<00:01:12.329> of<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.659> done<00:01:13.470> the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
all the pipe work once of a done the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.580 
all the pipe work once of a done the
test<00:01:13.829> of<00:01:14.009> that<00:01:14.130> we<00:01:14.490> should<00:01:14.670> see<00:01:15.229> yeah<00:01:16.229> right

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
test of that we should see yeah right

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.800 
test of that we should see yeah right
near<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.860> top<00:01:16.890> understand<00:01:17.670> pipe<00:01:17.969> so<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.509> bell

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
near the top understand pipe so the bell

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.560 
near the top understand pipe so the bell
siphon<00:01:19.049> should<00:01:19.500> be<00:01:19.590> kicking<00:01:19.829> in<00:01:20.270> pretty<00:01:21.270> soon

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
siphon should be kicking in pretty soon

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.969 
siphon should be kicking in pretty soon
see<00:01:24.570> what<00:01:24.689> happens<00:01:25.140> fingers<00:01:25.500> crossed

still trying there at the mate so here
we<00:01:50.850> go<00:01:51.090> why<00:01:52.340> siphons<00:01:53.340> starting<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.909> kick<00:01:54.119> in

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:09.199 

we<00:02:01.469> guys<00:02:01.740> fly<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:03.350> bow<00:02:07.369> so<00:02:08.369> see<00:02:08.670> if<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:08.879> can<00:02:09.060> keep

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
we guys fly and bow so see if I can keep

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.020 
we guys fly and bow so see if I can keep
the<00:02:09.360> same<00:02:09.569> pace<00:02:10.039> because<00:02:11.039> I<00:02:11.250> say<00:02:11.580> yesterday

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
the same pace because I say yesterday

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.390 
the same pace because I say yesterday
when<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.239> tried<00:02:12.299> it<00:02:12.690> with<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.140> smaller<00:02:14.040> valve

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
when I tried it with the smaller valve

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.839 
when I tried it with the smaller valve
here<00:02:14.989> the<00:02:15.989> fish<00:02:16.200> tank<00:02:16.410> is<00:02:16.560> over<00:02:16.709> flowed<00:02:17.040> and

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
here the fish tank is over flowed and

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:18.979 
here the fish tank is over flowed and
obviously<00:02:18.180> we<00:02:18.330> can't<00:02:18.510> be<00:02:18.599> doing<00:02:18.720> with<00:02:18.810> that

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
obviously we can't be doing with that

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.670 
obviously we can't be doing with that
can<00:02:19.170> we<00:02:19.549> now<00:02:20.549> that<00:02:20.610> rate<00:02:21.200> it<00:02:22.200> looks<00:02:22.379> quite

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
can we now that rate it looks quite

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.050 
can we now that rate it looks quite
promising<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:23.220> looks<00:02:23.340> like<00:02:23.519> it's<00:02:23.700> kind<00:02:23.970> of

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
promising it looks like it's kind of

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.300 
promising it looks like it's kind of
matching<00:02:24.390> this<00:02:24.510> right<00:02:24.720> here<00:02:26.750> yes

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
matching this right here yes

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.280 
matching this right here yes
and<00:02:29.310> it's<00:02:29.549> putting<00:02:29.760> water<00:02:30.060> in<00:02:30.269> the<00:02:30.450> tanks<00:02:31.230> and

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
and it's putting water in the tanks and

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.559 
and it's putting water in the tanks and
it<00:02:31.440> pumps<00:02:31.769> not<00:02:31.890> going<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.099> run<00:02:32.250> dry<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:35.569> you'll

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
it pumps not going to run dry and you'll

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.339 
it pumps not going to run dry and you'll
see<00:02:36.780> now<00:02:37.049> that<00:02:37.079> the<00:02:37.739> water<00:02:37.920> level<00:02:38.310> is<00:02:38.430> actually

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
see now that the water level is actually

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.030 
see now that the water level is actually
slightly<00:02:40.349> above<00:02:40.799> the<00:02:41.329> overflow<00:02:42.329> valve<00:02:42.540> is<00:02:43.040> but

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
slightly above the overflow valve is but

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.479 
slightly above the overflow valve is but
it<00:02:44.129> seems<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.430> be<00:02:44.489> handling<00:02:44.819> it<00:02:44.970> it's<00:02:45.150> not

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
it seems to be handling it it's not

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.610 
it seems to be handling it it's not
going<00:02:47.489> too<00:02:47.670> crazy

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
going too crazy

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.390 
going too crazy
thanks<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:49.769> open<00:02:50.040> up<00:02:50.160> all<00:02:50.579> right<00:02:50.760> oh<00:02:52.099> I<00:02:53.099> don't

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
thanks to open up all right oh I don't

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.050 
thanks to open up all right oh I don't
know

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
know

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.819 
know
you<00:02:54.480> see<00:02:54.720> that<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.109> rate<00:02:55.290> at<00:02:55.440> which<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.709> water

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
you see that the rate at which the water

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.250 
you see that the rate at which the water
is<00:02:55.950> flowing<00:02:56.010> out<00:02:56.660> is<00:02:57.660> actually<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:58.049> little<00:02:58.140> bit

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
is flowing out is actually a little bit

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.199 
is flowing out is actually a little bit
quicker<00:02:58.500> than<00:02:58.769> what<00:02:58.890> do<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.129> overflow<00:02:59.910> pipe

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
quicker than what do you overflow pipe

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:11.040 
quicker than what do you overflow pipe
is<00:03:00.420> letting<00:03:00.660> out

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.950 

a<00:03:11.190> bit<00:03:12.190> touch-and-go<00:03:12.430> still<00:03:13.420> got<00:03:13.570> quite<00:03:13.780> a<00:03:13.810> lot

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
a bit touch-and-go still got quite a lot

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.250 
a bit touch-and-go still got quite a lot
of<00:03:13.990> water<00:03:14.140> to<00:03:14.350> drain<00:03:14.560> out<00:03:14.620> there<00:03:14.980> as<00:03:15.040> well<00:03:15.250> now

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
of water to drain out there as well now

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.240 
of water to drain out there as well now
obviously<00:03:17.260> when<00:03:17.440> I've<00:03:17.530> got<00:03:17.680> my<00:03:17.770> media<00:03:18.100> in

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
obviously when I've got my media in

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.310 
obviously when I've got my media in
there<00:03:18.810> there's<00:03:19.810> going<00:03:19.900> to<00:03:19.960> be<00:03:20.020> a<00:03:20.080> lot<00:03:20.170> less

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
there there's going to be a lot less

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.380 
there there's going to be a lot less
watering<00:03:20.770> as<00:03:21.640> you<00:03:21.820> picked<00:03:22.030> up<00:03:22.240> yesterday

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
watering as you picked up yesterday

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.300 
watering as you picked up yesterday
while<00:03:22.870> cutting<00:03:23.080> this<00:03:23.350> carry<00:03:23.890> bags<00:03:24.130> over

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
while cutting this carry bags over

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.530 
while cutting this carry bags over
elsewhere<00:03:24.970> play<00:03:25.870> pebbles<00:03:26.700> so<00:03:27.700> let's<00:03:28.210> get<00:03:28.420> them

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
elsewhere play pebbles so let's get them

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.220 
elsewhere play pebbles so let's get them
and<00:03:28.720> get<00:03:29.470> them<00:03:29.560> and<00:03:29.680> give<00:03:29.860> them<00:03:29.920> a<00:03:29.980> good<00:03:30.070> wash

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
and get them and give them a good wash

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.340 
and get them and give them a good wash
so<00:03:32.610> I<00:03:33.610> don't<00:03:34.120> know<00:03:34.180> this<00:03:34.360> this<00:03:34.600> water<00:03:34.900> level<00:03:35.260> is

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
so I don't know this this water level is

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.140 
so I don't know this this water level is
rising<00:03:35.380> up<00:03:36.040> quite<00:03:36.370> quick<00:03:36.670> but<00:03:36.850> it<00:03:36.940> doesn't

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
rising up quite quick but it doesn't

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.500 
rising up quite quick but it doesn't
seem<00:03:37.270> to<00:03:37.390> be<00:03:37.450> going<00:03:37.600> up<00:03:37.780> any<00:03:37.990> further<00:03:39.330> so<00:03:40.330> when

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
seem to be going up any further so when

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.960 
seem to be going up any further so when
you<00:03:40.630> luck<00:03:40.840> I<00:03:41.260> think<00:03:42.220> this<00:03:42.550> might<00:03:42.760> be<00:03:42.820> a

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
you luck I think this might be a

00:03:42.970 --> 00:04:03.300 
you luck I think this might be a
successful<00:03:43.390> test<00:03:43.750> I<00:04:00.600> think<00:04:01.600> they're<00:04:02.310> almost

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
successful test I think they're almost

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.780 
successful test I think they're almost
about<00:04:03.970> equal<00:04:04.650> see<00:04:05.650> messed<00:04:05.860> up<00:04:06.010> I<00:04:06.370> stood<00:04:06.580> right

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
about equal see messed up I stood right

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.390 
about equal see messed up I stood right
here<00:04:06.850> hasn't<00:04:07.390> changed<00:04:07.960> so<00:04:08.860> hasn't<00:04:09.100> gone<00:04:09.160> under

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
here hasn't changed so hasn't gone under

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.970 
here hasn't changed so hasn't gone under
the<00:04:09.430> wall<00:04:09.610> yet<00:04:09.910> I<00:04:10.320> think<00:04:11.320> yeah<00:04:11.500> they're<00:04:11.950> very

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
the wall yet I think yeah they're very

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.890 
the wall yet I think yeah they're very
called<00:04:12.490> each<00:04:12.610> other<00:04:12.760> oh<00:04:15.600> yeah

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900
