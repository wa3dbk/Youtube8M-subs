00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
to make sure that I had a higher

so<00:03:32.620> varied<00:03:33.040> x.x<00:03:33.550> T<00:03:33.820> is<00:03:33.940> the<00:03:34.060> product<00:03:34.300> that<00:03:34.570> I

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
so varied x.x T is the product that I

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:41.630 
so varied x.x T is the product that I
use<00:03:34.660> so<00:03:35.110> that<00:03:35.260> really<00:03:35.500> helped<00:03:35.920> me<00:03:36.040> out

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.760 

you<00:03:42.640> cannot<00:03:43.150> get<00:03:43.690> nutrients<00:03:44.290> from<00:03:44.440> foods

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
you cannot get nutrients from foods

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.309 
you cannot get nutrients from foods
alone<00:03:45.130> and<00:03:45.400> I<00:03:45.849> believe<00:03:46.330> that<00:03:46.360> nutrients<00:03:47.200> and

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
alone and I believe that nutrients and

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:48.930 
alone and I believe that nutrients and
supplements<00:03:47.950> make<00:03:48.250> a<00:03:48.280> huge<00:03:48.640> difference

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
supplements make a huge difference

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.610 
supplements make a huge difference
because<00:03:49.180> when<00:03:49.720> you're<00:03:49.840> just<00:03:50.050> eating<00:03:50.290> if

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
because when you're just eating if

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.960 
because when you're just eating if
you're<00:03:50.739> on<00:03:50.890> a<00:03:50.920> diet<00:03:51.190> you're<00:03:51.610> not<00:03:51.760> gonna<00:03:51.849> be

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
you're on a diet you're not gonna be

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.490 
you're on a diet you're not gonna be
able<00:03:52.030> to<00:03:52.150> get<00:03:52.270> all<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:52.540> nutrients<00:03:53.020> especially

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
able to get all the nutrients especially

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.530 
able to get all the nutrients especially
if<00:03:53.830> you're<00:03:53.950> on<00:03:54.040> a<00:03:54.069> diet<00:03:54.250> to<00:03:54.550> lose<00:03:54.580> body<00:03:54.970> fat<00:03:55.120> and

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
if you're on a diet to lose body fat and

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.240 
if you're on a diet to lose body fat and
as<00:03:55.750> you<00:03:55.930> get<00:03:56.080> older<00:03:56.440> it's<00:03:56.680> harder<00:03:56.769> to<00:03:57.010> recover

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
as you get older it's harder to recover

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.430 
as you get older it's harder to recover
I<00:03:57.760> believe<00:03:58.180> that<00:03:58.209> I<00:03:58.480> wouldn't<00:03:58.780> be<00:03:58.840> able<00:03:58.900> to<00:03:59.140> get

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
I believe that I wouldn't be able to get

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.320 
I believe that I wouldn't be able to get
into<00:03:59.650> shape<00:03:59.739> that<00:04:00.069> I<00:04:00.099> did<00:04:00.400> if<00:04:00.910> I<00:04:01.060> didn't<00:04:01.269> have

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
into shape that I did if I didn't have

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.830 
into shape that I did if I didn't have
his<00:04:01.780> spire<00:04:01.989> nutrition<00:04:02.470> products
