00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello good today is a presentation how 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.120
 prepare a single chicken red wine 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.299
 For this we need the following 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.299
 ingredients 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:16.810
 We have here 5 chicken legs 5 slices 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:20.439
 of bacon a pinch of rosemary 1 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:23.529
 about 37 about 350 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:29.310
 milliliters of red wine and leaves 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:31.019
 laurel butter and dehydrated zetas 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.090
 start making this dish first 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.670
 What we have to do is catch and pour 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:41.179
 the cee is inside a sauce bowl without 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:44.230
 and then we pour water 

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:44.230
 hot on top 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:54.510
 there it goes and let them rest 15 minutes 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.969
 until rehydrate hitherto 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.079
 let's wait approximately 15 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.449
 minutes 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.789
 then we take a spoonful 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.009
 large of butter such that at last and 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:08.320
 we pour it in the pot and leave it 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.930
 melt 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.780
 while it melts we are going to throw 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.260
 herbs that we have said before that are the 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.260
 rosemary 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:23.470
 a bit the equivalent of a twig 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.470
 and a laurel leaf 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.080
 we see how the 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.080
 Butter 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.350
 and we incorporate it 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.180
 and we raise alava by moving it 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.840
 continuously until the butter 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.840
 it melts 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.110
 as we can see the butter has already been 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.760
 melted once it will melt the 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.980
 butter we will proceed to throw 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.660
 chicken thighs it is important that the 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.360
 chicken legs are skinned 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:03.530
 because later we will wrap it in 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.600
 FANCESA so that we catch thighs 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.820
 chicken such that they make without skin the 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.860
 in the pan one by one and we leave them 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.430
 put a while until we see that 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.430
 be golden 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.300
 Once the chicken is golden, we have 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.310
 poured the mushrooms such that in order 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.480
 and then proceed to cast the 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.750
 wine 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.489
 this glass equals 350 milliliters if 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.370
 you have a smaller glass 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:37.659
 you will have to come out low and half pour 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.659
 at last the wine 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.110
 you have seen it 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.900
 and now we cover the pan and leave it 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.090
 cook until the wine is consumed that 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.990
 It can be about 20 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.990
 minutes half an hour 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.130
 as we can observe the wine 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.620
 practically has been consumed already so 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.080
 we are going to proceed to remove the thighs 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.500
 of chicken to later wrap them 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.500
 in bacon 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.590
 We are taking out the thighs one by one and 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.160
 placing them on a separate plate 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.120
 d 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.120
 thus 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.920
 once we have the chicken taken out of the 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.170
 casserole let's proceed to wrap it 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.580
 with the bacon for it we are going to 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:42.090
 use some wooden chopsticks 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.220
 like these to hold the bacon and so 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.230
 prevent it from falling apart 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.210
 as we can see we already have our 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.980
 chicken wrapped in bacon for a 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.080
 then we will proceed to return to 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.070
 put it in the pan to 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.070
 finish knowing him 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.810
 put the chicken in the pot 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.720
 we will proceed to add a little more 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.700
 water to finish cooking 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.410
 we take about half a glass and 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.090
 we pour it again and leave it 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.540
 Finish cooking until finished 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.540
 be done 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.939
 as we will see below 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.070
 the broth has practically been 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:20.350
 consumed so what are we going to do 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.810
 is proceeding to remove it from the chicken and 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.950
 placing it on a tray to put it 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.380
 to serve him 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.570
 once finished the chicken will present 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.150
 this aspect really is a very dish 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.740
 easy to make and really delicious as well 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.940
 that I hope you enjoy cooking 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.940
 until next time
