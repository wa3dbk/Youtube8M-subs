00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:10.840 

hey<00:01:09.229> guys<00:01:09.440> this<00:01:09.650> shot<00:01:09.860> from<00:01:10.040> strangle<00:01:10.520> films

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
hey guys this shot from strangle films

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.820 
hey guys this shot from strangle films
and<00:01:11.450> what<00:01:11.600> you<00:01:11.720> just<00:01:11.870> saw<00:01:12.080> was<00:01:12.110> a<00:01:12.320> comparison

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
and what you just saw was a comparison

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.160 
and what you just saw was a comparison
video<00:01:13.100> of<00:01:13.610> three<00:01:14.390> cameras<00:01:14.810> that<00:01:14.960> we<00:01:15.020> thought

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
video of three cameras that we thought

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.889 
video of three cameras that we thought
would<00:01:15.320> be<00:01:15.409> interesting<00:01:15.590> to<00:01:16.430> see<00:01:16.670> put<00:01:17.600> against

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
would be interesting to see put against

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:19.600 
would be interesting to see put against
each<00:01:17.990> other<00:01:18.170> in<00:01:18.439> terms<00:01:18.680> of<00:01:18.829> their<00:01:18.979> slow-motion

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
each other in terms of their slow-motion

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.310 
each other in terms of their slow-motion
capabilities<00:01:20.210> you<00:01:20.630> know<00:01:20.719> these<00:01:20.930> are<00:01:21.110> come

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
capabilities you know these are come

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.389 
capabilities you know these are come
these<00:01:21.530> cameras<00:01:21.860> you're<00:01:21.950> starting<00:01:22.219> to<00:01:22.280> see

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
these cameras you're starting to see

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:23.499 
these cameras you're starting to see
them<00:01:22.490> more<00:01:22.610> and<00:01:22.700> more<00:01:22.790> on<00:01:22.969> set<00:01:23.210> they're<00:01:23.420> gonna

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
them more and more on set they're gonna

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.450 
them more and more on set they're gonna
be<00:01:23.689> popular<00:01:24.170> we<00:01:24.680> think<00:01:24.860> over<00:01:24.979> the<00:01:25.130> next<00:01:25.280> couple

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
be popular we think over the next couple

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.940 
be popular we think over the next couple
years<00:01:26.000> so<00:01:26.299> it's<00:01:27.289> I<00:01:27.439> think<00:01:27.500> it's<00:01:27.740> a<00:01:27.799> pretty

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
years so it's I think it's a pretty

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.709 
years so it's I think it's a pretty
valid<00:01:28.340> you<00:01:28.700> know<00:01:28.759> comparison<00:01:29.329> to<00:01:29.450> put<00:01:29.600> these

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:29.719 
valid you know comparison to put these

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:31.389 
valid you know comparison to put these
up<00:01:29.869> against<00:01:30.170> each<00:01:30.289> other<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:30.950> first<00:01:31.189> camera

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
up against each other the first camera

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:34.569 
up against each other the first camera
we<00:01:31.579> looked<00:01:31.759> at<00:01:31.909> was<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:32.299> sony<00:01:32.719> fs7<00:01:33.159> the<00:01:34.159> fo7

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
we looked at was the sony fs7 the fo7

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.590 
we looked at was the sony fs7 the fo7

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
will do 1080 resolution and it'll do 180

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.080 
will do 1080 resolution and it'll do 180

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
frames a second in that mode which is

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.389 
frames a second in that mode which is
really<00:01:41.689> impressive<00:01:42.229> the<00:01:42.469> ff7<00:01:42.799> is<00:01:42.979> a<00:01:43.070> sub<00:01:43.250> 10

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
really impressive the ff7 is a sub 10

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.639 
really impressive the ff7 is a sub 10
thousand<00:01:43.759> dollar<00:01:43.939> camera<00:01:44.210> you're<00:01:45.109> going<00:01:45.469> when

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
thousand dollar camera you're going when

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.109 
thousand dollar camera you're going when
you<00:01:45.740> go<00:01:45.920> to<00:01:45.979> the<00:01:46.159> higher<00:01:46.460> framerate<00:01:46.850> you're

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
you go to the higher framerate you're

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.209 
you go to the higher framerate you're
gonna<00:01:47.210> have<00:01:47.390> to<00:01:47.479> sacrifice<00:01:47.689> resolution<00:01:48.680> or<00:01:48.920> if

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
gonna have to sacrifice resolution or if

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:51.580 
gonna have to sacrifice resolution or if
you<00:01:49.340> want<00:01:49.549> to<00:01:49.609> have<00:01:49.930> high<00:01:50.930> resolution<00:01:51.079> you're

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
you want to have high resolution you're

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.319 
you want to have high resolution you're
gonna<00:01:51.680> have<00:01:51.859> to<00:01:51.979> sacrifice<00:01:52.159> your<00:01:52.789> available

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
gonna have to sacrifice your available

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:55.929 
gonna have to sacrifice your available
frame<00:01:53.570> rates<00:01:53.810> but<00:01:54.380> I<00:01:54.439> think<00:01:54.710> the<00:01:54.829> ff7<00:01:55.219> delivers

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
frame rates but I think the ff7 delivers

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:57.969 
frame rates but I think the ff7 delivers
a<00:01:55.969> lot<00:01:56.210> of<00:01:56.329> bang<00:01:56.479> for<00:01:56.689> your<00:01:56.780> buck<00:01:56.979> especially

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
a lot of bang for your buck especially

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.490 
a lot of bang for your buck especially
considering<00:01:58.520> that<00:01:58.579> the<00:01:58.789> next<00:01:59.179> step<00:01:59.390> up<00:01:59.600> the

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
considering that the next step up the

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.580 
considering that the next step up the
area<00:02:00.799> Mira<00:02:01.159> costs<00:02:01.909> quite<00:02:02.329> a<00:02:02.390> bit<00:02:02.630> more<00:02:02.810> and

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
area Mira costs quite a bit more and

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.190 
area Mira costs quite a bit more and
what<00:02:03.890> its<00:02:04.009> going<00:02:04.130> to<00:02:04.189> give<00:02:04.399> you<00:02:04.579> is<00:02:04.960> 200<00:02:05.960> frames

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
what its going to give you is 200 frames

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.590 
what its going to give you is 200 frames
a<00:02:06.320> second<00:02:06.710> at<00:02:06.829> 2k<00:02:07.249> resolution<00:02:07.600> strictly

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
a second at 2k resolution strictly

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.510 
a second at 2k resolution strictly
comparing<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.229> slow-motion<00:02:09.710> capabilities

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
comparing the slow-motion capabilities

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.190 
comparing the slow-motion capabilities
I'd<00:02:10.789> say<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.060> ff7<00:02:11.420> does<00:02:11.690> pretty<00:02:11.870> good<00:02:11.960> in

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
I'd say the ff7 does pretty good in

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.010 
I'd say the ff7 does pretty good in
comparison<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:13.160> area<00:02:13.910> Mira<00:02:14.300> has<00:02:14.570> a<00:02:14.600> lot<00:02:14.990> of

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
comparison the area Mira has a lot of

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.900 
comparison the area Mira has a lot of
other<00:02:15.350> great<00:02:15.590> options<00:02:16.160> besides<00:02:16.340> the

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
other great options besides the

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.880 
other great options besides the
slow-motion<00:02:17.360> but<00:02:18.110> because<00:02:18.319> it's<00:02:18.500> designed<00:02:18.650> to

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
slow-motion but because it's designed to

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.649 
slow-motion but because it's designed to
be<00:02:18.980> a<00:02:19.040> documentary<00:02:19.580> camera<00:02:20.090> it<00:02:20.300> really<00:02:20.540> is

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:20.659 
be a documentary camera it really is

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:21.880 
be a documentary camera it really is
important<00:02:21.080> that<00:02:21.110> it<00:02:21.260> can<00:02:21.379> do<00:02:21.500> that<00:02:21.650> slow

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
important that it can do that slow

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:22.500 
important that it can do that slow
motion

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
motion

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.690 
motion
and<00:02:22.599> what's<00:02:22.959> nice<00:02:23.140> is<00:02:23.409> that<00:02:23.530> it<00:02:23.620> records<00:02:24.040> to<00:02:24.370> a

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
and what's nice is that it records to a

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.170 
and what's nice is that it records to a
delivery<00:02:25.180> codec<00:02:25.720> and<00:02:25.900> records<00:02:26.319> to<00:02:26.700> ProRes<00:02:27.700> the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
delivery codec and records to ProRes the

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.149 
delivery codec and records to ProRes the
other<00:02:28.329> one<00:02:28.510> we<00:02:28.659> did<00:02:28.840> was<00:02:29.019> the<00:02:29.170> red<00:02:29.379> epic<00:02:29.769> for

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:30.159 
other one we did was the red epic for

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:32.699 
other one we did was the red epic for
years<00:02:30.519> the<00:02:30.849> epic<00:02:31.150> has<00:02:31.269> been<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.750> slowest<00:02:32.439> you

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
years the epic has been the slowest you

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.860 
years the epic has been the slowest you
can<00:02:32.890> go<00:02:33.099> without<00:02:33.819> going<00:02:34.299> to<00:02:34.420> a<00:02:34.450> dedicated

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
can go without going to a dedicated

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.920 
can go without going to a dedicated
slow-motion<00:02:35.560> camera<00:02:35.950> it'll<00:02:36.340> do<00:02:36.549> 300<00:02:37.540> frames<00:02:37.780> a

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
slow-motion camera it'll do 300 frames a

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.740 
slow-motion camera it'll do 300 frames a
second<00:02:38.319> at<00:02:38.470> 2k<00:02:39.159> resolution<00:02:39.489> which<00:02:40.150> is<00:02:40.180> pretty

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
second at 2k resolution which is pretty

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.720 
second at 2k resolution which is pretty
impressive<00:02:40.930> slow<00:02:41.319> motion<00:02:41.739> the<00:02:42.069> only<00:02:42.340> thing

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
impressive slow motion the only thing

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.339 
impressive slow motion the only thing
that's<00:02:42.909> a<00:02:43.000> little<00:02:43.030> annoying<00:02:43.540> with<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:44.079> way<00:02:44.230> it

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
that's a little annoying with the way it

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.430 
that's a little annoying with the way it
works<00:02:44.620> is<00:02:44.980> that<00:02:45.090> when<00:02:46.090> it<00:02:46.480> drops<00:02:46.930> to<00:02:47.049> 2k

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
works is that when it drops to 2k

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.259 
works is that when it drops to 2k
resolution<00:02:47.590> it<00:02:48.190> actually<00:02:48.519> windows<00:02:49.030> the

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
resolution it actually windows the

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.059 
resolution it actually windows the
sensor<00:02:49.629> which<00:02:49.870> introduces<00:02:50.500> about<00:02:50.769> a<00:02:50.799> two

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
sensor which introduces about a two

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.399 
sensor which introduces about a two
times<00:02:51.310> crop<00:02:51.670> factor<00:02:51.939> so<00:02:52.569> you're<00:02:52.780> 50

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:53.409 
times crop factor so you're 50

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:56.009 
times crop factor so you're 50
millimeter<00:02:53.799> lens<00:02:54.129> is<00:02:54.370> gonna<00:02:54.579> have<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:55.019> field

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
millimeter lens is gonna have the field

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.229 
millimeter lens is gonna have the field
of<00:02:56.170> view<00:02:56.349> of<00:02:56.650> a<00:02:56.739> hundred<00:02:57.099> millimeter<00:02:57.489> lens<00:02:57.790> so

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
of view of a hundred millimeter lens so

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.910 
of view of a hundred millimeter lens so
that's<00:02:58.989> definitely<00:02:59.230> something<00:02:59.709> you<00:02:59.739> have<00:02:59.799> to

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
take the maximum aperture is very

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.289 
take the maximum aperture is very
important<00:03:06.370> being<00:03:06.609> able<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:06.819> have<00:03:06.940> a<00:03:06.970> nice<00:03:07.090> fast
