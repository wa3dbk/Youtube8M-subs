00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.970
 good and now the reverse trip in the 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:13.120
 little chair 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.120
 I had the good fortune to go down accompanied 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:19.610
 but now I'm alone 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.200
 Fortunately 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.200
 is crossing me here 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.790
 and I do not feel anymore 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.790
 so fearful 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:37.120
 in my first experience as a tourism 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.120
 of adventure 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:48.270
 The visits of Piriápolis are a classic 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.560
 in the first time 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.560
 that I get on them 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.250
 here we have 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.110
 people who are going down but who barely 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.180
 we are going to see it because they cover me 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.180
 Chau column on trip 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.180
 it's a spectacular day with something of 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.400
 wind we should recognize it and more 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.780
 keeping in mind the height at which 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.210
 we're 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:26.690
 ascending to the top of Cerro San 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.690
 antonio 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.039
 as we can see 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.409
 constructions that 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:40.520
 adorn the hillside 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.310
 and staff that was working and that 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.299
 Well, they deserve a moment of rest 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.299
 greeting boys 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:56.000
 staff that cuts the grass 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.900
 some bushes 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 naturally 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.000
 they form on the hillside 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.060
 Cerro San Antonio 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:31.980
 Piriápolis spa department 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:31.980
 maldonado oriental republic of uruguay 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.010
 until the next notes
