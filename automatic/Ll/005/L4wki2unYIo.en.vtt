you can just do um go in do some reno
runs<00:03:34.709> because<00:03:34.890> actually<00:03:35.459> you<00:03:35.880> do<00:03:36.000> or<00:03:36.269> Audrina

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
runs because actually you do or Audrina

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.550 
runs because actually you do or Audrina
runs<00:03:37.350> and<00:03:37.709> let's<00:03:38.670> say<00:03:38.910> you<00:03:39.420> get<00:03:39.540> 200<00:03:40.260> Dimps

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
runs and let's say you get 200 Dimps

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.800 
runs and let's say you get 200 Dimps
because<00:03:40.859> 40<00:03:41.250> plus<00:03:41.370> 40<00:03:41.730> plus<00:03:41.760> 4<00:03:42.209> plus<00:03:42.239> 40<00:03:42.780> plus

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
because 40 plus 40 plus 4 plus 40 plus

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.470 
because 40 plus 40 plus 4 plus 40 plus
40<00:03:43.320> so<00:03:43.680> that's<00:03:43.859> basically<00:03:43.980> 4<00:03:44.489> times<00:03:44.700> 5<00:03:44.970> equals

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
40 so that's basically 4 times 5 equals

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.340 
40 so that's basically 4 times 5 equals
20<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:46.019> I<00:03:46.410> dollar<00:03:47.480> 0-200<00:03:48.480> and<00:03:48.720> it's<00:03:49.049> just

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
20 and I dollar 0-200 and it's just

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.009 
20 and I dollar 0-200 and it's just
