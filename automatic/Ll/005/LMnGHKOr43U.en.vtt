 little more generations as you have already read 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:22.760
 the title is canceled pokemon 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:26.119
 reasons three reasons of the creator that 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.640
 called satoko or touched did not know how to 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.470
 pronounces his name or his nickname about 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.750
 the name like mine 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.920
 says he canceled it because of the fact that 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.230
 three reasons there are the three reasons one does not 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.329
 I had enough money the truth I do not know 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.070
 what did they mean enough money and 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.470
 in materials that they bought to create 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.850
 the pokemones or someone who created him 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:53.089
 the pokemones which doubt otherwise this one 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.970
 I had burns I did not have the rights to 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:58.400
 author would also say the rights of 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.930
 author for the fact that they could 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.540
 demand what can be a lawsuit 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.260
 the company's intent or the creator of 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.760
 pokemon and the last one that would be that I wanted 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.890
 start from the beginning create a 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.340
 new game his imagination does not 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.960
 copied from a game or something I hope the 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.250
 fact that you want to start over like this 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.330
 it already know the three reasons and 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.970
 Well, I 'm not going to continue with 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.150
 a series of pokemon generations I do not know 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.960
 if I plan to delete that video or leave it there 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.119
 although I would like to leave it there because 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.159
 for me it was one of the best games of 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.509
 pokÃ©mon that I have played until now 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.580
 once it was not complete because it was in 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.540
 beta version and do something more important 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.270
 that many people expected the game 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.590
 and I was already waiting, I was going to leave but 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.510
 Mere now says that I was not going to 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.910
 continue with the game and I think that the 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.090
 game was canceled in March we are in 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.860
 April and already spent one going to do two 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.320
 months or a month I want it canceled 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.780
 because the current I expected it to come out 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.930
 well that was going to cancel and things like that 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.900
 to be checked and make a video 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.260
 well informed and those were the reasons 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.030
 which I investigated that was the 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.860
 error that canceled a bit and then 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.050
 nothing we would be taking out the video 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.810
 of pokemon the truth pixels followed and 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:17.040
