00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.459
 hello and welcome to this 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:16.519
 new video today a big one 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:20.599
 tutorial how to make a ringtones 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:23.720
 created on the iphone so it many 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:26.330
 come maybe a android 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.250
 Bit foreign because android smartphone 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.730
 of course very very simple ringing tone 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.940
 or sounds your own to create the song 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.160
 what is on it and says as a child 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.120
 set it done so easy it is 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.680
 unfortunately not at ios but in the reason if 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.370
 we know how to do it is not 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.379
 heavy 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.930
 I can show you that simply times 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:51.829
 very short and very fast what you 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.280
 it really needs what they like us 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.410
 it works just as well on one 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.239
 windows-calculator portals pack so I have 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.530
 I opened the itunes easily be 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:06.979
 I just want to expand again 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:09.830
 So, of course, makes you need of 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.509
 This may not exceed 40 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.299
 seconds otherwise it will work 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:17.840
 not easy to regulate how do you say 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:22.000
 she goes from right mouse button goes 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:25.100
 on information goes on option 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.979
 and is because here you can adjust 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:35.149
 start stopped 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:36.829
 start from the genes third time 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.799
 Just listen to it for sure 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.509
 and then says the 40 and tries 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:46.270
 yourself out when part of the clinical 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:48.979
 should start and when it is finished 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.200
 let's just start as when 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:57.430
 for example, ten seconds but with me 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.430
 start and a point is of course 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.030
 0.50 are exactly 40 seconds 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.080
 you just press okay you can see it 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.259
 nothing has changed 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:13.490
 I have to take right now 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:17.090
 mouse button and then go to acc ac 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.860
 Create version as it seeks 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.280
 actor version here with 40 and 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.140
 longer 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.970
 that is, so to speak, already that 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.350
 ringing tone but we can of course 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.660
 Do not use it like that yet 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.250
 that is, we take the file click 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:37.160
 here of and drag it times 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:39.459
 pulled out so finished and we 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.930
 you have to rename now 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:47.120
 we have here now so you have to 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:50.060
 ending mph just change in the 4th 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.790
 that the ringing sound from the market of rio 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.739
 is just so adversarial okay asks 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.610
 now once again wanted to keep what country 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.870
 of course, change something so unfinished 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.300
 Now we can simply I again 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.640
 pure in itunes because we have to be the old one 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.150
 file that we have created easily 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.250
 Clear 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.440
 where the right mouse button again 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.470
 Clear 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:18.190
 as requested because of course on the 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:22.190
 title course in team ico move like that 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:26.720
 a lot is gone now we just do it 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.260
 your double click and that is now again 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.640
 in it 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:35.180
 we see up here he plays him now 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:37.730
 , and he does not show them here 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.450
 that's because he's already in the ringing tone 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:47.360
 sacrifices go up here on extras then 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:51.079
 we have sounded here once against and 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:54.220
 see that he is here instantly seconds 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:57.670
 has tried it once 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.890
 before again behind ringing tone 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.430
 we'll see you here too shortly 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.410
 had that up still running 44 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:10.510
 seconds so we now go on 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:12.970
 iPhone and look here tones tones 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:16.079
 yes, all tones and we symbolize 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:19.560
 click on synchronize 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.560
 first very briefly 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.840
 so finished now the sounds should be synonymous 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:36.830
 the device can go wages here 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:39.080
 down we see that the ringing tone 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.190
 on smartphones still shows the 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.370
 briefly on a smartphone as I said 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:47.270
 we are going to attitude but yes 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:49.849
 and imagine going back 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:54.110
 Settings go up to tones 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:56.770
 ringing tone and there we see the song 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:01.120
 ringing tone on the smartphones 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:05.030
 activate and that 's it in the reason 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.030
 easy when you know it's the 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.520
 so have been at this point already 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.509
 Thanks for watching and we'll see 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.020
 us at the next video 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:14.020
 See you
