evaporates<00:00:25.560> away<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:25.859> there's<00:00:26.160> no<00:00:26.279> sort<00:00:26.519> of

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
evaporates away so there's no sort of

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.120 
evaporates away so there's no sort of
cleanup<00:00:26.880> like<00:00:27.060> people<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:28.050> have<00:00:28.500> absolutely<00:00:28.949> no

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.630 

all<00:00:49.710> right<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.010> first<00:00:50.160> thing<00:00:50.370> out<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.550> the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
all right so the first thing out of the

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.790 
all right so the first thing out of the
box<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.420> little<00:00:51.660> guy<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.110> pistol

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
box is this little guy this is a pistol

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
that I can fit 250 rounds in it which is

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.220 
that I can fit 250 rounds in it which is
amazing

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230

whole bunch of things that are basically

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.490 
whole bunch of things that are basically
like<00:02:02.250> seeds<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.780> put<00:02:03.929> the<00:02:03.990> seeds<00:02:04.200> in<00:02:04.469> a

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
like seeds and you put the seeds in a

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.169 
like seeds and you put the seeds in a
glass<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.890> water<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.490> scenes<00:02:05.729> absorbed

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
glass of water and the scenes absorbed

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:07.669 
glass of water and the scenes absorbed
water<00:02:06.359> and<00:02:06.659> they<00:02:06.750> basically<00:02:06.899> turn<00:02:07.229> into<00:02:07.259> heat

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
water and they basically turn into heat

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:09.410 
water and they basically turn into heat
but<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.459> don't<00:02:08.610> have<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.849> do<00:02:08.970> this<00:02:09.090> for<00:02:09.269> those

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
but you don't have to do this for those

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.580 
but you don't have to do this for those
the<00:02:09.599> other<00:02:09.720> ones<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:09.929> have<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.110> like<00:02:10.229> let<00:02:10.500> them

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
the other ones you have to like let them

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.860 
the other ones you have to like let them
soak<00:02:10.800> for<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:11.160> long<00:02:11.340> time<00:02:11.610> but<00:02:12.090> not<00:02:12.239> not<00:02:12.540> paper

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
soak for a long time but not not paper
