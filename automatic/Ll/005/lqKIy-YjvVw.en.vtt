00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.080

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.460
 division iii I will get 11,000 believe that 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.050
 will give it all to you 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.180
 this is the opposing team this is 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.800
 the second game of the division 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.140
 kissling and robert lee when you face 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.170
 which behind we have suffered there in the two 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.730
 model a pretty strong team 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.090
 let's see what happened in this one 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.090
 game 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.190
 talk sturridge sturges the mind for 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.230
 of maria as aguero than if in the immediate one 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.719
 a great goal in the fourth minute as in the 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.719
 first game from a few minutes marks 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.699
 a nice goal 10 let's see him again in the corner 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.710
 to the right of the goalkeeper 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.129
 well so 1 to 0 at the fourth minute of the 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.129
 first half 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:05.380
 at the festival ridge for aguero aguero 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.380
 really good 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.290
 150 160 thousand credits but spent beautiful 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.360
 2 to 0 we are at the beginning first time 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:19.820
 better than that could not go by it 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:21.170
 this we win maria marie 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.659
 penalty areas take the ball 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.520
 recovers great part of the goalkeeper who 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.899
 keeps the result unchanged but 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.729
 look what happens big 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.560
 dribbling even the black tides of 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.750
 rigor company lands it the usual a 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.399
 vincent kompany and therefore football of 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.020
 rigor penalties that the kick and 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.000
 the kun brought to mind to pull them 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.399
 then powerful penalty kicks 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.050
 all hardware power triggered the shot 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.860
 which ends up not much but 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.390
 ends up out 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.710
 do not tell me that they pull it more slowly 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.780
 because I really enjoy what it was 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.429
 of that 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.369
 cuadrado cuadrado fails to score 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:54.530
 after a great bike incredible 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.590
 clichy from the flag razor blades for 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.030
 walker walker walker still him area of 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.310
 penalty takes the ball recovers it 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.380
 tisci puts it in the middle of maria 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.520
 scores the goal of 3 to 0 at 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.520
 forty-five minutes 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.010
 forty-five minutes we are on 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.780
 result of 3 to 0 and so ends the 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.670
 first time therefore with this beautiful goal of 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.200
 ángel di maría di testa we see what 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.850
 happens to the sixty-first mine 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.130
 opponent pauses and leaves 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.650
 therefore as I could foresee I can 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.600
 win this game and get 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.490
 four total points together with the first one 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.930
 obviously then we go immediately to 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.820
 play the next game we are at 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.610
 third game of a very important game 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.200
 because it could outline a departure a 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.230
 google so let's see a team 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.420
 attacking a series ppl a little strange 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.220
 with front star jeremic and cabella 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.200
 behind while in defense we cast 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.970
 also the will cash in on inquires right 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.550
 while felipe luis on the left handanovic 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.440
 in the door 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.510
 we are on 0 to 0 even after 45 minutes 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.250
 unfortunately no action of the first 45 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.989
 minutes was a very pale game 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.769
 nothing happens until maria non 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.260
 lands to the opposing goalkeeper 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.030
 handanovic deserved red anyway 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.380
 both as we all know it is not 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.940
 can give rosie on fouls on 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.100
 goalkeeper and direct in this way 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.380
 however life is sturridge words 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.239
 to the eighty-first crystal reggi daniel 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.890
 sturridge the saved sturridge shot 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.760
 so we always stay with the porter 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.829
 on 0 0 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.110
 you understand at the eighty-fourth you believe the 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:21.020
 puts in the middle for cavani to slip into me 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.750
 moon there were 34 th must decide the 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.760
 so I hope for the match and three more points 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.510
 strongly to be able to conclude 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.460
 this episode 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.170
 with this goal we see what it is 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.750
 success we review the fine goal from the head 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:37.360
 in the shoe in the unstoppable corner 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.360
 cut and stay at 84th 50 years 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.660
 ninety-fifth what happens there 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.260
 a gain gain in soccer of 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.500
 punishment 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.480
 look what happens it happens that walker 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.810
 decides to do some jogging on the 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.730
 right wing of his own half court e 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.220
 he enjoys himself practically having fun 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.989
 so for some time say that 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.120
 I was hoping the referee whistled instead 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.910
 the referee did not whistle because this 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.310
 it is a resounding bug and I spend 70 euros 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.489
 to the ninetieth when I am winning by 1 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:10.580
 at 0 after five minutes and mine 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:12.500
 player continues to jog on 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.300
 band with fabregas or diego costs who 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.400
 fuck is on the right that you are 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.989
 heating up he did not know what to do I 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.030
 I paused but after I put it in 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.859
 home after pausing three times 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.270
 my opponent could no longer here tar 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.180
 so I decided to wait 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.040
 wait to pause the third 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.290
 time after half an hour pauses and for 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.820
 my luck pursued rightly 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.900
 because I was saying zero and 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.150
 he deserved the victory 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.430
 so time we are another victory 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.660
 so seven points well this promises 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.610
 division promises yours well 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.770
 possible gains because if you win but 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.050
 division will be 11 thousand credits that 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.180
 I will give you more than levitas thumb areas 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.169
 to put I like fine arts then and 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.169
 see you next episode
