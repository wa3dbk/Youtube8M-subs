since<00:00:00.329> I<00:00:00.450> qualified<00:00:01.020> I've<00:00:01.350> been<00:00:01.530> very<00:00:01.709> aware

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
since I qualified I've been very aware

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.820 
since I qualified I've been very aware
that<00:00:02.129> older<00:00:02.909> people<00:00:03.049> suffered<00:00:04.049> from<00:00:04.319> problems

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
that older people suffered from problems

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.920 
that older people suffered from problems
with<00:00:05.009> nutrition<00:00:05.640> and<00:00:05.819> that<00:00:06.120> started<00:00:06.629> really

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
with nutrition and that started really

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.190 
with nutrition and that started really
from<00:00:07.710> a<00:00:08.189> deterioration<00:00:09.030> that<00:00:09.269> occurs<00:00:09.840> in<00:00:09.870> the

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
from a deterioration that occurs in the

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.799 
from a deterioration that occurs in the
normal<00:00:10.650> physiology<00:00:11.010> of<00:00:11.400> aging<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.210> then<00:00:12.660> you

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
normal physiology of aging and then you

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.440 
normal physiology of aging and then you
compound<00:00:13.110> that<00:00:13.530> by<00:00:13.950> having<00:00:14.250> older<00:00:14.730> people<00:00:15.299> who

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
compound that by having older people who

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.330 
compound that by having older people who
are<00:00:15.599> real<00:00:15.809> my<00:00:16.500> role<00:00:16.650> in<00:00:16.740> this<00:00:16.830> project<00:00:17.070> is

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
ready to help development of foods and

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.849 
ready to help development of foods and
recipes<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:24.380> hopefully<00:00:25.380> give<00:00:25.680> more

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
recipes that hopefully give more

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.200 
recipes that hopefully give more
excitement<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.400> older<00:00:26.609> people<00:00:26.640> which<00:00:27.060> will

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
excitement to older people which will

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.580 
excitement to older people which will
make<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.449> game<00:00:27.630> more<00:00:27.660> interesting<00:00:27.960> eating

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
make the game more interesting eating

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.269 
make the game more interesting eating
eat<00:00:29.010> more<00:00:29.310> food<00:00:29.640> taking<00:00:30.179> more<00:00:30.359> nutrition<00:00:30.900> and

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
eat more food taking more nutrition and

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.950 
eat more food taking more nutrition and
ultimately<00:00:32.279> help<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.730> speedy<00:00:33.000> recovery<00:00:33.210> in

Miami for well over a century now and
this<00:01:21.750> way<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:21.990> think<00:01:22.200> about<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.860> like<00:01:23.220> salt

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
this way to think about it is like salt

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.940 
this way to think about it is like salt
or<00:01:24.210> sugar<00:01:25.140> or<00:01:26.040> sweet<00:01:26.729> rather<00:01:27.470> it's<00:01:28.470> something

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
or sugar or sweet rather it's something

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.390 
or sugar or sweet rather it's something
that<00:01:29.150> exists<00:01:30.150> in<00:01:30.329> many<00:01:30.509> products<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.400> exists

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
that exists in many products and exists

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.069 
that exists in many products and exists
in<00:01:32.520> quite<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.759> lot<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:32.970> dishes<00:01:33.240> savory<00:01:33.840> dishes

actually got a lot of knowledge about

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.690 
actually got a lot of knowledge about
how<00:02:30.600> to<00:02:30.630> mommy<00:02:31.110> taste<00:02:31.350> because<00:02:31.800> he<00:02:31.980> uses<00:02:32.220> it<00:02:32.550> as

how to mommy taste because he uses it as

how to mommy taste because he uses it as
particularly<00:02:33.120> in<00:02:33.210> his<00:02:33.330> restaurant<00:02:33.510> so<00:02:34.230> I

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
particularly in his restaurant so I

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.140 
particularly in his restaurant so I
wanted<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.800> really<00:02:35.010> harvest<00:02:35.820> some<00:02:36.000> of<00:02:36.090> the

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
wanted to really harvest some of the

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.210 
wanted to really harvest some of the
chef's<00:02:36.390> knowledge<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.380> put<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:37.920> science

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
chef's knowledge and put the science

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.150 
chef's knowledge and put the science
behind<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.270> be<00:02:39.450> able<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.780> apply<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.560> into<00:02:41.070> a

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
behind it and be able to apply it into a

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.490 
behind it and be able to apply it into a
very<00:02:41.400> real<00:02:41.580> setting<00:02:42.090> so<00:02:42.540> Heston<00:02:42.960> provides<00:02:43.290> his

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
very real setting so Heston provides his

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.980 
very real setting so Heston provides his
ideas<00:02:44.040> in<00:02:44.850> terms<00:02:44.910> of<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.270> way<00:02:45.420> he<00:02:45.660> would<00:02:45.810> use

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
ideas in terms of the way he would use

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.630 
ideas in terms of the way he would use
ingredients<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:47.040> know<00:02:47.130> he<00:02:47.250> probably<00:02:47.340> knows

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
ingredients you know he probably knows

an<00:02:47.760> awful<00:02:47.820> lot<00:02:48.090> more<00:02:48.240> about<00:02:48.330> selecting

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
an awful lot more about selecting

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.990 
an awful lot more about selecting
seaweeds<00:02:49.380> than<00:02:49.620> any<00:02:49.770> other<00:02:50.100> person<00:02:50.280> in<00:02:50.520> the<00:02:50.580> UK

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.690 
seaweeds than any other person in the UK
perhaps<00:02:51.420> but<00:02:52.410> I<00:02:52.440> need<00:02:52.710> to<00:02:52.830> to<00:02:53.280> then<00:02:53.430> put<00:02:53.580> the

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
perhaps but I need to to then put the

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.100 
perhaps but I need to to then put the
science<00:02:54.000> behind<00:02:54.090> that<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.540> say<00:02:54.690> well<00:02:54.930> what

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
science behind that to say well what

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
these ingredients how can we maximize

producing a standard shepherd's pie but
I<00:03:06.690> can<00:03:06.840> still<00:03:07.020> use<00:03:07.290> his<00:03:07.470> knowledge<00:03:07.710> and<00:03:08.130> then

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
I can still use his knowledge and then

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.590 
I can still use his knowledge and then
apply<00:03:08.700> it<00:03:08.760> back<00:03:08.940> into<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.210> very<00:03:09.390> standard

trying to do now we're focusing on umami

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.860 
trying to do now we're focusing on umami
at<00:03:14.610> the<00:03:14.700> moment<00:03:15.060> because<00:03:15.270> it<00:03:15.420> is<00:03:15.810> very

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
at the moment because it is very

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.850 
at the moment because it is very
important<00:03:16.440> it's<00:03:16.800> as<00:03:16.920> important<00:03:17.340> as<00:03:17.730> a<00:03:17.940> salt<00:03:18.240> or

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
important it's as important as a salt or

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.460 
important it's as important as a salt or
sweetness<00:03:20.209> but<00:03:21.209> I<00:03:21.450> don't<00:03:21.930> believe<00:03:22.110> that<00:03:22.380> this

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
sweetness but I don't believe that this

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.900 
sweetness but I don't believe that this
is<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.680> only<00:03:22.860> thing<00:03:23.250> that<00:03:23.490> will<00:03:23.610> enhance

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
is the only thing that will enhance

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.020 
is the only thing that will enhance
enjoyment<00:03:24.450> will<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:25.380> excitement<00:03:25.980> so<00:03:26.820> we<00:03:26.940> will

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
enjoyment will and excitement so we will

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.650 
enjoyment will and excitement so we will
be<00:03:27.150> looking<00:03:27.300> at<00:03:27.570> other<00:03:27.720> aspects<00:03:28.380> of
