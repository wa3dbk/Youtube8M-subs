 during the Second World War 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.550
 in thailand a tennis coach train 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.150
 loaded with English soldiers when 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.880
 he received a telegraph and that he 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.809
 divert the train to the right and wait 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.770
 because the virus was destroyed 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:41.040
 since the last fight with the Japanese 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:45.390
 when many many Japanese were 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:49.980
 made prisoners from a list 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:54.120
 descending stopped stopped his train almost 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.149
 there at the end and as expected would be 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.359
 time, a tennis player asked all the 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:04.710
 soldiers who got off the train when 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:08.939
 British soldiers came down and saw a 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:12.030
 wagon heavily protected by 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:16.580
 guard a number of more or more 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:19.500
 at least 50 Japanese prisoners 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:23.210
 terribly injured 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.210
 but consider that the account 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:31.610
 all English soldiers pitied 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.539
 with the suffering of the enemies 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:39.439
 seeing that he was practically there 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:44.840
 abandoned children began to care for all 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:46.909
 the children were water want bindings 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.799
 but the guards did not agree with 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:53.270
 that how you are treating 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:56.929
 well these criminals these enemies 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:00.590
 the British soldiers independent of the 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:05.140
 protest of the guards continued to 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:09.170
 take care of the Japanese wounded and stay there 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:13.569
 while the wait lasted they took care of 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:17.299
 of enemy soldiers all minimize them 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:20.540
 all the bitterness and hatred that had the 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:23.599
 Japanese at least in that group to 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.459
 the English and the Allies disappeared 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.489
 completely 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:32.420
 the Japanese became friends with 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:36.140
 and when the railroad was 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.510
 restored and the training again received 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.480
 permission to leave with a train of 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.680
 English soldiers 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.370
 these submitted from the Japanese and 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.870
 grateful 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:54.159

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.730
 in that parable of Jesus Christ with tone 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.459
