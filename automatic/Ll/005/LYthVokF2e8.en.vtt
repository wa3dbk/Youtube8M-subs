the<00:01:53.289> one<00:01:53.499> that<00:01:53.679> increases<00:01:54.130> your<00:01:54.279> speed<00:01:54.459> wall

on<00:01:55.119> the<00:01:55.209> ground<00:01:55.479> I<00:01:55.920> want<00:01:56.920> to<00:01:57.009> bring<00:01:57.130> a<00:01:57.219> way<00:01:57.310> to

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
on the ground I want to bring a way to

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.279 
on the ground I want to bring a way to
send<00:01:57.609> much<00:01:57.819> earlier<00:01:58.240> in<00:01:58.299> this<00:01:58.719> overview<00:01:59.109> about

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
send much earlier in this overview about

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:01.109 
send much earlier in this overview about
how<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.649> bomber<00:01:59.919> fights<00:02:00.219> a<00:02:00.369> lot<00:02:00.399> different

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
how the bomber fights a lot different

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:02.719 
how the bomber fights a lot different
than<00:02:01.179> the<00:02:01.329> other<00:02:01.539> mechs<00:02:01.840> while<00:02:02.049> on<00:02:02.139> the<00:02:02.200> ground

than the other mechs while on the ground

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.919 
than the other mechs while on the ground
basically<00:02:03.729> you're<00:02:03.999> forced<00:02:04.359> to<00:02:04.450> move<00:02:04.569> into<00:02:04.749> the

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:04.929 
basically you're forced to move into the

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:06.959 
basically you're forced to move into the
damage<00:02:05.319> range<00:02:05.529> of<00:02:05.770> ground<00:02:06.219> units<00:02:06.520> or<00:02:06.639> worse

forward bases on the ground rather

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:12.600 
forward bases on the ground rather
difficult<00:02:10.989> for<00:02:11.349> the<00:02:11.439> bomber<00:02:11.650> compared<00:02:12.370> to<00:02:12.430> the

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
about more than five to six units it's

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.619 
about more than five to six units it's
best<00:02:20.189> not<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.459> attack<00:02:20.879> on<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.239> ground<00:02:21.450> by

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
best not to attack on the ground by

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.539 
best not to attack on the ground by
yourself<00:02:22.110> especially<00:02:22.319> if<00:02:22.980> they're<00:02:23.099> all<00:02:23.220> able

to shoot you at the same time here it's

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.380 
to shoot you at the same time here it's
a<00:02:26.069> good<00:02:26.220> idea<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.549> take<00:02:26.790> advantage<00:02:27.030> of<00:02:27.269> the

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
a good idea to take advantage of the

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.569 
a good idea to take advantage of the
attack<00:02:27.780> minor<00:02:28.110> base<00:02:28.409> command<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.099> set<00:02:29.459> in

attack minor base command and set in

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:31.520 
attack minor base command and set in
about<00:02:29.939> two<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.239> three<00:02:30.390> tanks<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.019> support<00:02:31.440> you

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
about two to three tanks to support you

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.589 
about two to three tanks to support you
or<00:02:31.680> simply<00:02:32.400> use<00:02:32.549> the<00:02:32.579> bomb<00:02:32.879> ability<00:02:33.360> from<00:02:33.510> the

or simply use the bomb ability from the

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.680 
or simply use the bomb ability from the
get<00:02:33.870> go<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:34.230> clean<00:02:34.470> out<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.709> base<00:02:34.890> also<00:02:35.690> you

get go to clean out the base also you

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.960 
get go to clean out the base also you
will<00:02:36.840> notice<00:02:37.079> the<00:02:37.620> bomber<00:02:37.950> is<00:02:38.069> terrible<00:02:38.879> at

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
will notice the bomber is terrible at

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.580 
will notice the bomber is terrible at
supporting<00:02:39.450> ground<00:02:39.720> troops<00:02:39.989> on<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.230> attack

supporting ground troops on the attack

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.220 
supporting ground troops on the attack
the<00:02:41.340> best<00:02:41.609> and<00:02:41.849> only<00:02:42.090> way<00:02:42.390> to<00:02:42.450> do<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:42.870> is<00:02:43.019> with

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
the best and only way to do it is with

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.740 
the best and only way to do it is with
bombs<00:02:43.560> or<00:02:43.859> mantis<00:02:44.280> strike<00:02:44.579> otherwise<00:02:45.359> you're

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
bombs or mantis strike otherwise you're

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.509 
bombs or mantis strike otherwise you're
slapping<00:02:46.170> yourself<00:02:46.230> in<00:02:46.560> a<00:02:46.620> red<00:02:46.890> target<00:02:47.310> paint

slapping yourself in a red target paint

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.130 
slapping yourself in a red target paint
and<00:02:47.730> we'll<00:02:47.909> get<00:02:48.030> slammed<00:02:48.390> by<00:02:48.510> missiles<00:02:48.989> and

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
and we'll get slammed by missiles and

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.729 
and we'll get slammed by missiles and
gunfire<00:02:49.500> real<00:02:49.980> quick<00:02:50.340> I<00:02:51.109> like<00:02:52.109> to<00:02:52.230> expand<00:02:52.620> on

gunfire real quick I like to expand on

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.770 
gunfire real quick I like to expand on
some<00:02:52.769> extra<00:02:53.280> strategies<00:02:53.639> with<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.329> abilities

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
some extra strategies with the abilities

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.440 
some extra strategies with the abilities
starting<00:02:55.319> with<00:02:55.409> the<00:02:55.560> bombs<00:02:55.769> a<00:02:56.239> neat<00:02:57.239> trick

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
starting with the bombs a neat trick

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.240 
starting with the bombs a neat trick
with<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.780> bombs<00:02:58.200> is<00:02:58.379> to<00:02:58.560> use<00:02:58.739> it<00:02:58.889> as<00:02:58.980> a<00:02:59.010> weapon

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
with the bombs is to use it as a weapon

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.220 
with the bombs is to use it as a weapon
