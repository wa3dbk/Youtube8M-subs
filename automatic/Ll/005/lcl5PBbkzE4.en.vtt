00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
discord ever on a PC and then you would

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.440 
discord ever on a PC and then you would
just<00:02:55.230> install<00:02:55.709> that<00:02:55.970> but<00:02:56.970> it<00:02:57.060> might<00:02:57.180> be<00:02:57.330> like

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
just install that but it might be like
