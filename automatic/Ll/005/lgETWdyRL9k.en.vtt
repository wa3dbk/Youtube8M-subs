00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
down all right I guess I'll just I guess

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.490 
down all right I guess I'll just I guess
I'll<00:01:50.450> just<00:01:50.479> pop<00:01:50.780> it<00:01:50.929> in<00:01:51.020> like<00:01:51.049> that<00:01:53.409> there<00:01:54.409> we

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
I'll just pop it in like that there we

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.350 
I'll just pop it in like that there we
go<00:01:54.619> it's<00:01:54.770> nap<00:01:55.039> surrounded<00:01:55.549> everywhere<00:01:55.670> pretty

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
go it's nap surrounded everywhere pretty

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.840 
go it's nap surrounded everywhere pretty
pretty<00:01:56.929> snug<00:01:57.200> actually<00:01:59.679> and<00:02:00.679> then<00:02:00.829> just<00:02:01.189> says

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
pretty snug actually and then just says

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.960 
pretty snug actually and then just says
just<00:02:02.030> to<00:02:02.119> put<00:02:02.270> it<00:02:02.360> back<00:02:02.450> in<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:02.659> case<00:02:02.899> so<00:02:03.970> I'm

camera these holes right here or the
touch<00:03:44.540> sensor<00:03:45.019> so<00:03:45.400> it<00:03:46.400> says<00:03:46.669> that<00:03:46.880> is<00:03:47.030> anti

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
touch sensor so it says that is anti

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.260 
touch sensor so it says that is anti
dust<00:03:48.109> and<00:03:48.500> water<00:03:49.340> resistant<00:03:49.940> so

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
dust and water resistant so

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.050 
dust and water resistant so
not<00:03:50.570> really<00:03:50.870> sure<00:03:51.200> how<00:03:51.380> that's<00:03:51.530> so

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
not really sure how that's so

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.850 
not really sure how that's so
water-resistant<00:03:53.060> when<00:03:53.240> the<00:03:53.860> fingerprint

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
water-resistant when the fingerprint

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.860 
water-resistant when the fingerprint
scanner<00:03:55.010> isn't<00:03:55.550> covered<00:03:55.940> and<00:03:56.180> the<00:03:56.390> camera<00:03:56.780> is

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
scanner isn't covered and the camera is

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.770 
scanner isn't covered and the camera is
it's<00:03:57.080> covered<00:03:57.470> and<00:03:58.150> this<00:03:59.150> right<00:03:59.360> here<00:03:59.540> is<00:03:59.660> open

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
it's covered and this right here is open

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.220 
it's covered and this right here is open
so<00:04:00.110> I'm<00:04:00.260> not<00:04:00.410> really<00:04:00.590> sure<00:04:01.720> how<00:04:02.720> it's<00:04:02.960> fully

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
so I'm not really sure how it's fully

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.930 
so I'm not really sure how it's fully
protected<00:04:03.890> camera<00:04:04.400> actually<00:04:04.550> could<00:04:04.910> be

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
protected camera actually could be

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.240 
protected camera actually could be
covered<00:04:05.480> but<00:04:05.990> the<00:04:06.020> fingerprint<00:04:06.860> scanner<00:04:06.980> is

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
covered but the fingerprint scanner is

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.560 
covered but the fingerprint scanner is
definitely<00:04:07.640> not<00:04:07.790> covered<00:04:08.180> to<00:04:08.240> see<00:04:08.360> if<00:04:08.420> I<00:04:08.450> can

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
definitely not covered to see if I can

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.270 
definitely not covered to see if I can
get<00:04:08.660> a<00:04:08.690> close-up<00:04:08.960> up<00:04:09.260> here<00:04:09.470> but<00:04:09.860> you<00:04:09.950> can<00:04:10.070> see

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
get a close-up up here but you can see

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.160 
get a close-up up here but you can see
right<00:04:10.460> here<00:04:10.490> that<00:04:10.940> it's<00:04:11.420> just<00:04:11.600> wide<00:04:11.780> open<00:04:11.810> you

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
right here that it's just wide open you

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.230 
right here that it's just wide open you
can<00:04:12.290> see<00:04:12.440> the<00:04:12.560> casing<00:04:13.040> this<00:04:13.670> cutout<00:04:13.940> right

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.240 
can see the casing this cutout right

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.430 
can see the casing this cutout right
here<00:04:16.120> you'll<00:04:17.120> probably<00:04:17.299> see<00:04:17.540> right<00:04:17.690> here<00:04:17.959> it's

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
here you'll probably see right here it's

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.340 
here you'll probably see right here it's
cut<00:04:18.680> out<00:04:18.799> right<00:04:18.950> here<00:04:19.280> so<00:04:19.730> I<00:04:20.090> mean<00:04:20.930> it's<00:04:21.080> okay

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
cut out right here so I mean it's okay

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.010 
cut out right here so I mean it's okay
it's<00:04:21.739> definitely<00:04:21.860> cheaper<00:04:22.340> plastic<00:04:23.330> whereas

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
it's definitely cheaper plastic whereas

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.930 
it's definitely cheaper plastic whereas
the<00:04:24.260> Griffin<00:04:24.890> survivor<00:04:25.010> is<00:04:25.430> like<00:04:25.580> a<00:04:25.610> rubber

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
the Griffin survivor is like a rubber

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.330 
the Griffin survivor is like a rubber
but<00:04:26.750> for<00:04:26.930> 20<00:04:27.200> dollars<00:04:27.320> I<00:04:27.770> mean<00:04:27.800> it'll<00:04:28.130> probably

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
but for 20 dollars I mean it'll probably

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.710 
but for 20 dollars I mean it'll probably
be<00:04:28.550> okay<00:04:28.790> it'll<00:04:28.910> probably<00:04:29.090> do<00:04:29.240> the<00:04:29.330> job<00:04:29.540> I'm

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
be okay it'll probably do the job I'm

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.240 
be okay it'll probably do the job I'm
not<00:04:29.750> going<00:04:30.080> to<00:04:30.140> do<00:04:30.230> any<00:04:30.380> kind<00:04:30.500> of<00:04:30.590> drop<00:04:30.860> test<00:04:31.130> or

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
not going to do any kind of drop test or

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.390 
not going to do any kind of drop test or
anything<00:04:31.400> with<00:04:31.640> it<00:04:31.960> but<00:04:32.960> if<00:04:33.440> you<00:04:34.190> need<00:04:34.370> a

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
anything with it but if you need a

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.060 
anything with it but if you need a
twenty<00:04:34.700> dollar<00:04:34.880> case<00:04:35.150> it<00:04:35.930> seems<00:04:36.110> alright<00:04:36.500> it's

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
twenty dollar case it seems alright it's

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.820 
twenty dollar case it seems alright it's
light<00:04:37.370> the<00:04:38.330> survivor<00:04:38.660> made<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.170> iPad<00:04:39.560> a<00:04:39.590> lot

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
light the survivor made the iPad a lot

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.680 
light the survivor made the iPad a lot
heavier<00:04:41.230> so<00:04:42.760> here<00:04:43.760> you<00:04:43.820> go<00:04:43.940> this<00:04:44.180> is<00:04:44.330> the

heavier so here you go this is the

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.020 
heavier so here you go this is the
