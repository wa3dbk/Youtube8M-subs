00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:08.120
 hello more productive kitchen e 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.950
 happy Holidays 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.230
 in this video we present one 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.080
 raw food menu proposal for the holidays 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.410
 December 2014 and January 2015 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.330
 based on a selection of recipes 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.010
 devolved kitchen winter goes flat 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.740
 then processed with ingredients 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.900
 seasonal and easily available 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.850
 though in the raw kitchen at the bottom 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.869
 It makes little sense to talk about appetizers 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.760
 first seconds 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.190
 in this case we wanted to follow 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.320
 a subdivision of the Christmas lunch into 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.030
 different courses rather than proposing 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.310
 the classic single dish of the 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.340
 daily life of a raw food maker just for 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:46.340
 align with tradition and indulge 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.370
 so the desire of part of people 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.010
 that follow us therefore of a menu of the 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.440
 parties the recipes you will see on video 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.540
 have already been posted in the channel of 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.270
 youtube the most evolutionary cooking site 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.460
 we point out the links below in any case 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.590
 the info of this video we will give you more 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.600
 alternatives between first and second starters 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.329
 and so on and so on that you can 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.429
 choose according to your taste or taste 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:12.560
 ease of execution of the recipe 

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:14.689
 the advice we give you now if 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.719
 you want to bet more on the variety of 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.880
 bring and do not overdo the doses 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:21.950
 then to make small portions or 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.270
 maybe even taste in sila and finger 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.179
 food and if you like it 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.990
 well let 's see the menu of course 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:32.359
 from the appetizers as appetizers we find 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.880
 stardust a dish 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:37.399
 it would seem elaborate in reality yes 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.340
 it's a simple shake of a few 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.799
 ingredients a nice Russian salad though 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.179
 you do n't want to use frozen peas 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:47.419
 you can replace them to decorate 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:50.779
 the outside with a savory cd while for 

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:54.349
 the dough with thistles that are in season 

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:56.509
 raw thistles cut into small cubes i 

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:59.270
 decoration peppers finally are 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:02.779
 replaceable with tomato strips 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.029
 dried then you can choose from a 

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:07.909
 very good pumpkin carpaccio e 

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:11.480
 tasty or marinated artichokes 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:14.510
 and then we have a very good raw 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.269
 with herbs all the dishes you can 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.660
 prepare well in advance we pass 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:23.660
 to the first we have a risotto and a soup 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.129
 for the risotto you can choose between 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:30.769
 saffron risotto and porcini mushrooms 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:33.650
 or the equally very tasty 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:36.680
 risotto with red radicchio risotto 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.230
 Raw foodists are a sure success too 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.510
 for the most demanding guests I did not have 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.629
 to raw food cooking how much soups 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.780
 we have a choice of soup 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:50.239
 scented with cardamom or one 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.060
 simple and velvety spinach we see 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:56.510
 the second fennel meatballs with 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.750
 pesto of celery leaves or i 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.940
 smart broccoli with green sauce the 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.280
 outline of a beautiful fresh salad is 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.920
 always desirable in this case vi 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:11.269
 we propose the virgin based salad 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:14.030
 fennel and avocado we pass to sweets in 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:18.319
 first line is a beautiful panettone 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:20.299
 raw food in the specific recipe video 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.569
 you will see that there are several possibilities 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:25.840
 to make it even a variant 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.190
 riana fruit in this case 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.389
 in the image we have selected the 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.859
 pro food therefore raw food panettone made 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:37.069
 with sprouts 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:40.760
 but they are absolutely replaceable with 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:43.310
 dried apples or using flour 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.019
 of dried sprouts the flour of 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.109
 German literature is very simple to you 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:50.840
 make the sprouts dry and then 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:54.169
 the aftertaste of the 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.000
 shoots both fresh and also in flour 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:58.489
 it is rather bitter 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.709
 so if you don't like this taste is good 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.709
 that you replace it with dried apples 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:06.260
 and then we have dried figs covered with 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.780
 chocolate it is two variants one 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.500
 with orange flavored chocolate 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.510
 and the other with hazelnut chocolate 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:18.889
 an extremely easy and fast recipe 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:20.230
 and finally snow-covered cupcakes as you see 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.100
 it is really about 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:26.170
 ad hoc certainly for Christmas the base is 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:29.050
 delicately spiced with ginger 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:31.780
 cinnamon vanilla and above there is a 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:37.090
 sapling made with a lot of cream 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:39.550
 fresh made with orange coconut and mint 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.590
 remember that these are recipes with 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.470
 seasonal ingredients of the month of 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.240
 December but nothing forbids 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.060
 reinterpret other recipes you find 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.230
 in the evolutionary organic cooking site 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.840
 replacing the ingredients out 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:55.060
 season with those in season applies to 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.310
 the vegetable burgers the meatballs and others 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.560
 dishes if you don't follow seasonality 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.380
 of the ingredients the panorama of the dishes 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.660
 prepared there certainly extends but 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.510
 the important thing maybe would be to opt for 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:11.080
 fruit and vegetable products from agriculture 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:14.970
 perennial organic iron good year e 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.970
 good pro food to everyone
