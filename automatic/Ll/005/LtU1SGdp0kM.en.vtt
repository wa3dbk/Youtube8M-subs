00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 Well 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:14.700
 Let's try a song called Polling Slee on os os. 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.650
 Let's take a look at the first lines of code. 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.099
 For the first time, 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:25.820
 To 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:25.820
 By adding a t note pitch in the middle of the arpeggio pattern 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:33.470
 Understanding has been denied. 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.680
 The following code is the f code 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.980
 U 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:44.120
 During the performance of the song , 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.120
 With your thumb , grab a 6th Rayburn flat wi 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.390
 I got it this way. 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:57.490
 If you add a note to the d note while playing 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.490
 You can hold your finger with your little finger. 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.610
 Next is a minor code 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.610
 Well 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.500
 Next, the c code 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:21.920
 The code is the c5 code in the c code plus the pitch in the note 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:37.440
 Amour is about to catch a c- code form 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:37.440
 The child code that catches the small finger corresponding to the ad nine corresponds to the child code 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:48.049
 6 holiday wonjul once, you will not hear nadorok note in the week 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:53.530
 Per adult of a minor code 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:53.530
 A - 3 plus Flack Seven on line 1 - 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.080
 That concludes the code description. 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.320
 Ah lead 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.960
 222 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.960
