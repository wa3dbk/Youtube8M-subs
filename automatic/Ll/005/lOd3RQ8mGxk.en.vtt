00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 guiza who happened to welcome the dragon is 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.680
 that we have escaped back but 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.000
 we will be peak we will have this time 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.420
 we are going to do it a more copada way 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.550
 why because nacho 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.550
 because this time we're going to win 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.610
 I thought I was going to say something super 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:24.450
 important super special super 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:26.640
 because this time is the day when 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.080
 we will become heroes in 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.210
 the one that the heroes will become 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:36.150
 players and in which the steves are 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:39.980
 will become 2 sticks do not be like 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.980
 it takes a lifetime 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.760
 nothing 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:56.120
 covered 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.120
 or yes 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:11.170
 and that I do not see a shit was more 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.320
 dark that the balls of a cricket 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.320
 Hungary 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.460
 Y 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.219
 is that it happens so much at the same time that it does not 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.460
 I know if I did not see anything remove even it 's 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:27.860
 because it made me dizzy to send stupid 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.380
 are removed from media and have been given 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.110
 what do you care about in my game is 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.909
 important suicide 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.579
 so that it is too difficult for the 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.110
 impossible here looks at me from 10 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:42.350
 millions that we were we were there when 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.619
 there were 450 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:49.549
 you can not pass this 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:52.009
 that this may well happen but it is 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.310
 impossible so that impossible part is not 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.310
 can 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.590
 and step by step 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.100
 is that a lot has been spent in that part 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.860
 fuck do not fuck me I understand what is going to 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.280
 happen but one thing is that it's fun 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.600
 parkour right and something else 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.660
 burguete of falling a thousand times for new 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.660
 do what 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.660
 dragon 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.690
 because it's like the dragon but more dragon 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.980
 I'm suddenly imagining myself in my 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.980
 head the song I imagined dragons 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.140
 who invited this 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.900
 and cocks that will be hard to imagine 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:51.150

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.150

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.430
 I'm going to get here 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.810
 Let's see 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.810
 I have failed forgiveness 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.050

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.500

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:16.320

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.800

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.200
 hole you have to be subnormal 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.600
 but the truth 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.170

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.170

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:50.569
 be careful because dragons do not come 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:50.569

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.880

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.880
 epic 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:03.560

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.200
