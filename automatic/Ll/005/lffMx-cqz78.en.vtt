sacks so let's take a closer look now
shall<00:00:17.430> we<00:00:17.520> so<00:00:17.670> obviously<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.210> size<00:00:18.510> that's

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
shall we so obviously the size that's

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.929 
shall we so obviously the size that's
well<00:00:19.439> well<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.130> size<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.490> this<00:00:20.550> bad<00:00:20.730> boys

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
well well the size of this bad boys

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.759 
well well the size of this bad boys
nearly<00:00:21.210> as<00:00:21.270> big<00:00:21.420> as<00:00:21.449> me<00:00:21.720> obvious<00:00:22.289> it's<00:00:22.380> ideal

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
nearly as big as me obvious it's ideal

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.170 
nearly as big as me obvious it's ideal
for<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.070> know<00:00:23.160> your<00:00:23.340> long-term<00:00:23.609> travel

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
for you know your long-term travel

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.550 
for you know your long-term travel
especially<00:00:24.600> if<00:00:24.660> you're<00:00:24.779> going<00:00:24.930> away<00:00:25.170> for<00:00:25.529> a

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
especially if you're going away for a

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.400 
especially if you're going away for a
year<00:00:25.890> or<00:00:26.070> two<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.789> want<00:00:26.970> maximize<00:00:27.660> spaces

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
year or two and you want maximize spaces

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.349 
year or two and you want maximize spaces
say<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:28.590> get<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.800> combined<00:00:29.220> total<00:00:29.429> 100<00:00:30.029> liters

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
say you get a combined total 100 liters

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.150 
say you get a combined total 100 liters
with<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:30.660> pack<00:00:30.840> anyway<00:00:31.529> its<00:00:31.679> take<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.859> closer

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
with this pack anyway its take a closer

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.860 
with this pack anyway its take a closer
look<00:00:32.369> at<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.669> key<00:00:32.820> features<00:00:33.300> you've<00:00:33.719> got<00:00:33.840> a

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
look at the key features you've got a

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.720 
look at the key features you've got a
rip<00:00:34.110> stop<00:00:34.140> material<00:00:34.410> on<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.100> outside<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.550> it's

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
rip stop material on the outside so it's

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.430 
rip stop material on the outside so it's
nice<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.210> hard<00:00:36.540> bro<00:00:36.750> instead<00:00:37.079> that's<00:00:37.170> pretty

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
nice and hard bro instead that's pretty

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.720 
nice and hard bro instead that's pretty
much<00:00:37.530> covers<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:37.920> whole<00:00:38.160> part<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
much covers the whole part of the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.580 
much covers the whole part of the
section<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.210> it's<00:00:39.660> triple<00:00:39.989> as<00:00:40.079> well<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:40.410> it's

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
section and it's triple as well so it's

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.920 
section and it's triple as well so it's
got<00:00:40.680> three<00:00:41.070> stripes<00:00:41.430> going<00:00:41.820> sideways<00:00:42.420> and

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
got three stripes going sideways and

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.060 
got three stripes going sideways and
then<00:00:43.200> you've<00:00:43.320> got<00:00:43.410> three<00:00:43.620> straps<00:00:43.860> going

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
then you've got three straps going

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.830 
then you've got three straps going
downwards<00:00:44.520> as<00:00:44.670> well<00:00:44.850> even<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.420> material

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
downwards as well even the material

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.410 
downwards as well even the material
that's<00:00:46.020> not<00:00:46.140> rip<00:00:47.129> stop<00:00:47.309> material<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.820> hard<00:00:48.180> and

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
that's not rip stop material is hard and

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.959 
that's not rip stop material is hard and
durable<00:00:48.750> anyway<00:00:49.559> you've<00:00:50.489> got<00:00:50.579> your<00:00:50.760> two

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
durable anyway you've got your two

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
traditional pockets on the side they're

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.439 
traditional pockets on the side they're
five<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.190> up<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.579> this<00:00:53.699> one<00:00:53.879> they're<00:00:54.210> nice<00:00:54.420> and

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
five and up in this one they're nice and

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.450 
five and up in this one they're nice and
stretches<00:00:55.140> but<00:00:55.230> also<00:00:55.379> feel<00:00:55.680> they're<00:00:56.010> reactive

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
stretches but also feel they're reactive

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.729 
stretches but also feel they're reactive
to<00:00:56.670> your<00:00:56.850> water<00:00:57.090> bottle<00:00:57.510> as<00:00:57.690> well<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.350> they're

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
to your water bottle as well and they're

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.740 
to your water bottle as well and they're
all<00:00:58.890> where<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.399> +15<00:00:59.969> really<00:01:00.270> comes<00:01:00.449> into<00:01:00.660> play

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
all where the +15 really comes into play

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.479 
all where the +15 really comes into play
is<00:01:00.930> all<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.440> like<00:01:01.739> one<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.129> compression

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
is all the like one of the compression

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.850 
is all the like one of the compression
straps<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.690> if<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.870> just<00:01:04.080> briefly<00:01:04.320> show<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.650> one

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
straps so if I just briefly show you one

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.219 
straps so if I just briefly show you one
here<00:01:04.890> as<00:01:05.100> I've<00:01:05.189> got<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.400> undone<00:01:05.960> look<00:01:06.960> how<00:01:07.080> much

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
here as I've got it undone look how much

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.020 
here as I've got it undone look how much
volume<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.860> gives<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.520> can<00:01:08.729> reduce

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
volume that gives you so you can reduce

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.580 
volume that gives you so you can reduce
the<00:01:09.270> litre<00:01:09.450> which<00:01:09.659> by<00:01:09.900> quite<00:01:10.200> literally<00:01:10.470> just

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
the litre which by quite literally just

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.770 
the litre which by quite literally just
compressing<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.460> sides<00:01:11.729> damn<00:01:12.150> well<00:01:12.659> you'll

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
compressing the sides damn well you'll

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.899 
compressing the sides damn well you'll
also<00:01:12.930> notice<00:01:13.290> as<00:01:13.590> well<00:01:13.740> as<00:01:13.979> I'll<00:01:14.369> pull<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.729> up

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
also notice as well as I'll pull this up

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.210 
also notice as well as I'll pull this up
you've<00:01:15.750> got<00:01:15.780> an<00:01:16.200> entry<00:01:16.470> level<00:01:16.590> on<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.009> side

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
you've got an entry level on the side

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.770 
you've got an entry level on the side
there<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:17.670> you've<00:01:17.820> got<00:01:17.939> your<00:01:18.030> traditional<00:01:18.240> top

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
there so you've got your traditional top

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.450 
there so you've got your traditional top
entry<00:01:19.110> level<00:01:19.350> but<00:01:19.740> then<00:01:19.830> also<00:01:20.070> you've<00:01:20.430> got

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
entry level but then also you've got

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.429 
entry level but then also you've got
additional<00:01:20.880> storage<00:01:21.390> or<00:01:21.689> additional<00:01:22.080> entry

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
additional storage or additional entry

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.440 
additional storage or additional entry
on<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.710> side<00:01:22.920> down<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.970> pretty<00:01:24.299> much

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
on the side down and that is pretty much

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.120 
on the side down and that is pretty much
opens<00:01:24.810> up<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:24.990> whole<00:01:25.140> front<00:01:25.320> now<00:01:25.560> well<00:01:26.009> you'll

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
opens up the whole front now well you'll

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.649 
opens up the whole front now well you'll
notice<00:01:26.400> as<00:01:26.670> we<00:01:26.790> take<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:26.970> look<00:01:27.119> at<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.330> inside

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
notice as we take a look at the inside

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.300 
notice as we take a look at the inside
just<00:01:28.080> briefly<00:01:28.350> you've<00:01:28.799> got<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> store

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
just briefly you've got a store

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.819 
just briefly you've got a store
additional<00:01:29.640> storage<00:01:30.119> on<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.540> inside<00:01:30.930> as<00:01:31.229> well

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
additional storage on the inside as well

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.319 
additional storage on the inside as well
so<00:01:32.159> it's<00:01:32.310> kind<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.640> mixture<00:01:32.880> between<00:01:33.030> this

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
so it's kind of a mixture between this

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.120 
so it's kind of a mixture between this

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.929 
the zips themselves they've got really
nice<00:01:40.619> fun<00:01:40.920> loops<00:01:41.130> on<00:01:41.280> there<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.640> know<00:01:41.820> it's

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
key part really is for the +15 is the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.359 
key part really is for the +15 is the
compression<00:01:51.840> as'<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:52.979> take<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.189> look
