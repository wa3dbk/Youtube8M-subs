00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.429
 in 2002 the British company Oscar 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.080
 built a racing track coming here to 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.710
 be alone with her 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.529
 by car 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.310
 his turns are combinations of the best tracks 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.310
 from around the world 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.550
 and it was here that we came to 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.380
 test a new bmw m5 if you say 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.539
 that this car just quickly means 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.869
 don't say anything she's damn fast 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.869
 and 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.750
 Acceleration to a hundred takes her only 4 and 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.510
 4 seconds after another eight half 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.860
 hitting and house three will be 200 already and at 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.860
 it is well managed 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.360
 sometimes overdo it with speed and 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.860
 I think that this turn I will not enter 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.930
 all I take off but a miracle she enters the model 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.510
 of the leaders m have always been special 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.220
 first appearing 33 years ago they 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.140
 quickly won love and awe 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.250
 drivers now it seems ridiculous 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.750
 but the first m5 in 1984 had in its 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.010
 only two hundred 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.040
 eighty six horses 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.830
 then it was a formidable weapon following 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.080
 generation got 340 and then 400 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.750
 horsepower farther arms race 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.610
 completely out of control 2008 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.250
 year the car got the motor v10 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.300
 and half a thousand horses and now she 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.300
 they become even more powerful 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.240
 accelerates so fast that hard 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.800
 control speed 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.900
 hard to understand when to slow down 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.680
 because speed is typed simply 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.680
 catastrophically fast 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.650
 there are turns you can take 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.460
 at 180 kilometers per hour not straight 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.460
 turns 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.140
 cornering bends and fantastic 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.060
 sensations 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.720
 overload crazy just feeling 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.720
 yourself an astronaut 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.060
 such sensations can only be experienced 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.060
 in an amusement park 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.340
 the index allows you to trick the laws of physics 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.930
 step over the line that seems 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.079
 just impossible 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.700
 but everything has a limit of thrust here only 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.700
 so that any turn can be slid 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:37.849
 But if you do not turn off the system 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:39.920
 the stabilization of the machine is surprisingly calm 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.959
 except for the formidable exhaust and 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.060
 huge wheels, it almost does not give out 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:48.200
 of the whole character from the outside it's like 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.430
 The usual five in reality here 80 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.980
 percent either new 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.290
 either significantly reworked parts + 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.540
 active differential and increased to 80 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.859
 liters to the fuel tank and of course 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.769
 crazy motor and project somewhat 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:04.790
 laps on m5 I understand that it is not easy 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.989
 sports car is not easy 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.200
 sports sedan 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.510
 this is the killer of any sports car 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.660
 can go to the country and on the race 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.800
 track and do it so 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.800
 will not seem to anyone 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.410
 and me driving including 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.609
 I am ashamed to admit it first 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:36.099
 the car in which I even a little bit 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:36.099
 nauseated junction just noise 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.000
 i seem to feel my limit 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.000
 of opportunities 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.079
 all I pass if I buy my own 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.719
 roller coaster case enough 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:05.200
 troublesome need a lot of money and place well 

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:07.659
 this is such a bmw m5 a great solution she 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.840
 compact animation burns exactly 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:09.840
 same
