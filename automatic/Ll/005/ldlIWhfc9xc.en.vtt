on<00:00:16.020> how<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.230> hooked<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:16.590> up<00:00:16.710> so<00:00:17.520> we'll<00:00:17.640> take<00:00:17.730> a

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
on how I hooked it up so we'll take a

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.310 
on how I hooked it up so we'll take a
look<00:00:17.940> at<00:00:18.090> both<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.270> them<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.750> hopefully<00:00:19.199> you

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
look at both of them and hopefully you

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.900 
look at both of them and hopefully you
guys<00:00:19.470> can<00:00:19.529> get<00:00:19.859> some<00:00:20.010> ideas<00:00:20.369> on<00:00:20.550> how<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.699> hook

all up this is your stop for your idle
and<00:00:47.160> when<00:00:47.910> it's<00:00:48.059> floored<00:00:48.390> all<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.690> way<00:00:49.190> that

and when it's floored all the way that

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.119 
and when it's floored all the way that
precisely<00:00:50.820> matches<00:00:51.559> the<00:00:52.559> throttle<00:00:52.980> being

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
open all the way you don't want to have

half way be floored on your gas pedal
and<00:00:57.510> have<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:57.809> extra<00:00:58.370> because<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.399> will<00:00:59.699> end

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
and have this extra because you will end

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.130 
and have this extra because you will end
up<00:01:00.000> pushing<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.690> will<00:01:00.870> end<00:01:01.079> up

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
up pushing it and you will end up

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.670 
up pushing it and you will end up
breaking<00:01:01.410> something<00:01:04.850> now<00:01:06.229> this<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.380> kind<00:01:07.619> of

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
breaking something now this is kind of

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.170 
breaking something now this is kind of
how<00:01:08.159> important<00:01:08.960> you<00:01:09.960> see<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.290> nut<00:01:10.560> here<00:01:10.830> I

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
how important you see this nut here I

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.700 
how important you see this nut here I
think<00:01:12.180> that's<00:01:12.330> just<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.630> half<00:01:12.810> inch<00:01:12.960> threaded

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
think that's just a half inch threaded

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.130 
think that's just a half inch threaded
nut<00:01:13.979> we<00:01:14.729> drilled<00:01:15.060> one<00:01:15.299> side<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.780> nut<00:01:15.930> big

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
nut we drilled one side of the nut big

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.649 
nut we drilled one side of the nut big
enough<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.650> throttle<00:01:17.070> casing<00:01:17.939> can<00:01:18.509> go

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
enough so the throttle casing can go

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.719 
enough so the throttle casing can go
inside<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.770> other<00:01:19.920> side<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.280> just<00:01:20.520> big<00:01:20.700> enough

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
inside the other side is just big enough

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.840 
inside the other side is just big enough
for<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.890> throttle<00:01:22.890> cable<00:01:23.040> itself<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.670> come

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
for the throttle cable itself to come

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.130 
for the throttle cable itself to come
through<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.119> that's<00:01:24.450> how<00:01:24.659> we<00:01:24.720> hold<00:01:24.990> our

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
through so that's how we hold our

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.960 
through so that's how we hold our
throttle<00:01:25.350> cables<00:01:25.799> right<00:01:25.950> there<00:01:29.750> for<00:01:30.750> our

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
throttle cables right there for our

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.200 
throttle cables right there for our
attaching<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.240> throttle<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.990> gas<00:01:34.200> pedal

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
attaching the throttle to the gas pedal

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.880 
attaching the throttle to the gas pedal
we'll<00:01:36.210> use<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.420> bolt<00:01:36.720> like<00:01:36.930> this<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.439> then

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
we'll use a bolt like this and then

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.560 
we'll use a bolt like this and then
between<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.310> two<00:01:38.340> washers<00:01:38.909> we'll<00:01:39.270> drill<00:01:39.540> a

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
between the two washers we'll drill a

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.289 
between the two washers we'll drill a
hole<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.079> then<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:40.860> just<00:01:41.100> tighten<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.150> nut

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
hole and then you just tighten the nut

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.660 
hole and then you just tighten the nut
up<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.320> two<00:01:43.470> washers<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.189> clamps<00:01:44.579> it

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
up to the two washers and it clamps it

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.530 
up to the two washers and it clamps it
in<00:01:44.790> there<00:01:45.350> and<00:01:46.350> it's<00:01:47.570> you<00:01:48.570> see<00:01:49.189> right<00:01:50.189> there

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
in there and it's you see right there

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.120 
in there and it's you see right there
how<00:01:51.540> we<00:01:51.600> have<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.930> clamped<00:01:52.380> in<00:01:52.740> between<00:01:53.040> that

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
how we have it clamped in between that

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.130 
how we have it clamped in between that
nut<00:01:53.399> net<00:01:53.610> washer<00:01:54.060> there's<00:01:54.630> actually<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:54.960> hole

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
nut net washer there's actually a hole

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.240 
nut net washer there's actually a hole
right<00:01:55.170> through<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.649> middle<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:55.979> bolt

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
right through the middle of that bolt

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.010 
right through the middle of that bolt
that<00:01:56.820> bolts<00:01:57.210> welders<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.719> pedal

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
that bolts welders to the pedal

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.969 
that bolts welders to the pedal
obviously<00:02:00.140> now<00:02:01.140> let's<00:02:01.380> go<00:02:01.530> up<00:02:01.619> here<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:01.770> take

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
obviously now let's go up here and take

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:12.500 
obviously now let's go up here and take
a<00:02:02.009> look

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:21.870 

all<00:02:13.510> right<00:02:13.600> here<00:02:13.810> again<00:02:17.880> is<00:02:18.930> nut<00:02:20.460> we<00:02:21.460> have<00:02:21.640> a

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
all right here again is nut we have a

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.580 
all right here again is nut we have a
hole<00:02:22.510> big<00:02:22.690> enough<00:02:22.750> for<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.110> throttle<00:02:23.320> case

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
hole big enough for the throttle case

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.960 
hole big enough for the throttle case
and<00:02:23.770> you<00:02:23.830> sit<00:02:24.040> in<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.430> other<00:02:24.520> whole<00:02:24.700> side

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
and you sit in and the other whole side

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.670 
and you sit in and the other whole side
has<00:02:25.150> a<00:02:25.180> small<00:02:25.540> hole<00:02:25.720> just<00:02:26.080> for<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.290> cable<00:02:26.590> to

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
has a small hole just for the cable to

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.180 
has a small hole just for the cable to
come<00:02:26.830> through<00:02:29.610> if<00:02:30.610> you<00:02:30.730> look<00:02:30.910> here<00:02:32.190> it's

come through if you look here it's
actually<00:02:33.370> just<00:02:33.790> welded<00:02:34.120> to<00:02:34.330> a<00:02:41.160> there<00:02:42.160> right

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
actually just welded to a there right

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.990 
actually just welded to a there right
there<00:02:43.300> it's<00:02:44.200> just<00:02:44.470> an<00:02:44.560> exhaust<00:02:44.950> clamp<00:02:45.340> that<00:02:45.640> we

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
there it's just an exhaust clamp that we

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.750 
there it's just an exhaust clamp that we
welded<00:02:46.360> nut<00:02:46.660> on<00:02:46.810> top<00:02:47.050> of<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:48.400> just<00:02:48.580> take<00:02:48.730> that

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
welded nut on top of you just take that

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.400 
welded nut on top of you just take that
little<00:02:48.940> exhaust<00:02:49.600> clamp<00:02:49.870> and<00:02:49.990> you<00:02:50.050> clamp<00:02:50.320> it

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
little exhaust clamp and you clamp it

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:58.140 
little exhaust clamp and you clamp it
right<00:02:50.470> to<00:02:50.680> your<00:02:50.830> intake<00:02:51.130> pipe<00:02:56.850> and<00:02:57.850> you<00:02:58.000> can

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
right to your intake pipe and you can

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.090 
right to your intake pipe and you can
run<00:02:58.270> your<00:02:58.420> cable<00:02:58.810> across<00:03:01.650> right<00:03:02.650> there's<00:03:02.920> the

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
run your cable across right there's the

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.540 
run your cable across right there's the
back<00:03:03.250> side<00:03:03.520> this<00:03:03.760> piece<00:03:04.000> of<00:03:04.150> plastic<00:03:04.330> here

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
back side this piece of plastic here

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.030 
back side this piece of plastic here
that's<00:03:06.550> stock<00:03:07.500> you<00:03:08.500> just<00:03:08.709> drilled<00:03:08.950> a<00:03:09.010> hole

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
that's stock you just drilled a hole

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.040 
that's stock you just drilled a hole
little<00:03:09.430> bit<00:03:09.580> bigger<00:03:09.790> and<00:03:10.209> we<00:03:10.330> put<00:03:10.570> our<00:03:10.690> cable

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
little bit bigger and we put our cable

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.050 
little bit bigger and we put our cable
through<00:03:11.230> there<00:03:11.380> and<00:03:12.130> we<00:03:12.190> just<00:03:12.430> want<00:03:12.610> to<00:03:12.730> return

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
through there and we just want to return

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.949 
through there and we just want to return
to<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.300> spring<00:03:13.900> to<00:03:14.019> the<00:03:14.110> other<00:03:14.260> side<00:03:15.930> so<00:03:16.930> now

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
to the spring to the other side so now

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:23.009 
to the spring to the other side so now
we<00:03:17.320> can<00:03:17.590> watch<00:03:17.769> our<00:03:19.620> throttle<00:03:20.620> action<00:03:22.019> there's

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
we can watch our throttle action there's

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.750 
we can watch our throttle action there's
the<00:03:23.200> gas<00:03:23.380> pedal<00:03:23.739> all<00:03:23.799> the<00:03:23.890> way<00:03:23.980> down<00:03:24.190> there's

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
the gas pedal all the way down there's

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.160 
the gas pedal all the way down there's
up<00:03:27.120> that<00:03:28.120> completely<00:03:28.570> bypasses<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.440> governor

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
up that completely bypasses the governor

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.400 
up that completely bypasses the governor
the<00:03:32.170> governor<00:03:32.380> itself<00:03:33.810> it's<00:03:34.810> down<00:03:35.019> in<00:03:35.230> there

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
the governor itself it's down in there

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.930 
the governor itself it's down in there
don't<00:03:35.530> know<00:03:35.620> how<00:03:35.739> you<00:03:36.250> can<00:03:36.370> see<00:03:36.519> the<00:03:36.640> stubs

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
don't know how you can see the stubs

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.970 
don't know how you can see the stubs
sticking<00:03:37.330> out<00:03:37.420> for<00:03:37.690> it<00:03:37.780> there<00:03:37.959> but<00:03:38.769> we've

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
sticking out for it there but we've

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.920 
sticking out for it there but we've
removed<00:03:39.340> the<00:03:39.519> arm<00:03:39.760> and<00:03:40.060> all<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.299> linkages<00:03:40.600> off

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
removed the arm and all the linkages off

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.110 
removed the arm and all the linkages off
of<00:03:41.110> it<00:03:42.330> so<00:03:43.330> that's<00:03:43.450> one<00:03:43.690> way<00:03:43.840> we<00:03:43.870> do<00:03:44.140> it<00:03:44.260> on<00:03:45.120> this

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
of it so that's one way we do it on this

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.270 
of it so that's one way we do it on this
tractor<00:03:46.590> I'll<00:03:47.590> go<00:03:47.769> over<00:03:47.890> to<00:03:48.070> the<00:03:48.190> other

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
tractor I'll go over to the other

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.710 
tractor I'll go over to the other
tractor<00:03:48.610> and<00:03:48.880> we'll<00:03:49.000> take<00:03:49.150> a<00:03:49.180> look<00:03:49.390> at<00:03:49.450> it

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
tractor and we'll take a look at it

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.460 
tractor and we'll take a look at it
twin<00:03:50.650> tractor<00:03:51.780> let's<00:03:52.780> go<00:03:52.989> up<00:03:53.080> front<00:03:53.350> because

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
twin tractor let's go up front because

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:59.330 
twin tractor let's go up front because
that's<00:03:53.650> the<00:03:53.830> part<00:03:54.040> that's<00:03:54.070> different

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
we did is we used either a bolt with the

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.580 
we did is we used either a bolt with the
hole<00:04:13.480> drilled<00:04:13.780> in<00:04:13.870> it<00:04:13.930> and<00:04:14.110> have<00:04:14.230> a<00:04:14.260> squeezed

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
hole drilled in it and have a squeezed

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.400 
hole drilled in it and have a squeezed
between<00:04:14.769> two<00:04:15.040> washers<00:04:15.550> again<00:04:15.989> but<00:04:16.989> this<00:04:17.139> time

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
between two washers again but this time

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.550 
between two washers again but this time
I<00:04:17.680> have<00:04:18.310> welded<00:04:18.699> it<00:04:18.820> directly<00:04:19.449> on<00:04:19.660> the<00:04:19.810> end<00:04:20.019> of

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
I have welded it directly on the end of

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.830 
I have welded it directly on the end of
the<00:04:20.709> control<00:04:21.070> of<00:04:21.250> the<00:04:21.340> op<00:04:21.669> governor<00:04:23.430> so<00:04:24.840> we

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
the control of the op governor so we

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:34.590 
the control of the op governor so we
look<00:04:26.020> over<00:04:26.139> here<00:04:33.120> right<00:04:34.120> here

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
look over here right here

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.550 
look over here right here
the<00:04:35.229> governor<00:04:35.650> is<00:04:35.710> still<00:04:35.889> hooked<00:04:36.190> up<00:04:37.560> but

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
the governor is still hooked up but

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.990 
the governor is still hooked up but
there's<00:04:38.800> no<00:04:38.919> spring<00:04:39.280> anymore

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.790 

well<00:04:43.000> we<00:04:43.120> have<00:04:43.240> a<00:04:43.270> spring<00:04:43.570> here<00:04:43.810> this<00:04:44.500> is<00:04:44.650> your

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
well we have a spring here this is your

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.950 
well we have a spring here this is your
return<00:04:45.070> spring<00:04:45.460> anyways<00:04:46.419> it's<00:04:46.570> still<00:04:46.780> hooked

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
return spring anyways it's still hooked

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.060 
return spring anyways it's still hooked
up<00:04:47.080> to<00:04:47.169> the<00:04:47.260> governor<00:04:47.530> but<00:04:47.680> the<00:04:47.710> governor

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
up to the governor but the governor

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.730 
up to the governor but the governor
doesn't<00:04:48.280> do<00:04:48.580> anything<00:04:49.290> because<00:04:50.290> we<00:04:50.470> have<00:04:50.710> a

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
doesn't do anything because we have a

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.279 
doesn't do anything because we have a
direct<00:04:51.160> cable<00:04:51.720> attached<00:04:52.720> to<00:04:52.930> the<00:04:53.020> governor

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
direct cable attached to the governor

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:54.840 
direct cable attached to the governor
we're<00:04:53.440> just<00:04:53.650> using<00:04:53.830> the<00:04:54.100> lever<00:04:54.310> arm<00:04:54.550> of<00:04:54.760> the

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
we're just using the lever arm of the

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.390 
we're just using the lever arm of the
governor<00:04:55.210> to<00:04:55.450> run<00:04:55.630> the<00:04:55.780> throttle<00:04:56.229> so<00:04:57.070> you<00:04:57.160> see

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
governor to run the throttle so you see

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.689 
governor to run the throttle so you see
right<00:04:57.430> there<00:04:58.770> so<00:04:59.770> it<00:04:59.889> does<00:05:00.039> bypass<00:05:00.490> the

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 
right there so it does bypass the

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:02.640 
right there so it does bypass the
governor<00:05:01.090> and<00:05:01.270> it's<00:05:01.690> just<00:05:01.900> a<00:05:01.990> little<00:05:02.530> bit

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
governor and it's just a little bit

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.980 
governor and it's just a little bit
different<00:05:02.949> way<00:05:03.039> that<00:05:03.940> I<00:05:04.030> did<00:05:04.240> it<00:05:04.270> I<00:05:04.449> prefer<00:05:04.810> the

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
different way that I did it I prefer the

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.629 
different way that I did it I prefer the
other<00:05:05.139> way<00:05:05.320> it's<00:05:05.770> a<00:05:05.830> little<00:05:06.010> bit<00:05:06.100> simpler<00:05:06.490> and

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 
other way it's a little bit simpler and

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.690 
other way it's a little bit simpler and
gets<00:05:07.120> rid<00:05:07.300> of<00:05:07.450> a<00:05:07.479> couple<00:05:08.020> things<00:05:08.370> but<00:05:09.370> this<00:05:09.520> way

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
gets rid of a couple things but this way

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:18.510 
gets rid of a couple things but this way
works<00:05:09.940> too<00:05:16.440> there's<00:05:17.440> the<00:05:17.590> throttle<00:05:18.010> we've<00:05:18.220> run

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
works too there's the throttle we've run

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.629 
works too there's the throttle we've run
the<00:05:18.639> gas<00:05:18.820> pedal<00:05:19.289> you<00:05:20.289> see<00:05:20.530> it's<00:05:20.680> directly

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 
the gas pedal you see it's directly

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:24.450 
the gas pedal you see it's directly
connected<00:05:22.060> to<00:05:22.090> the<00:05:22.180> guest
