link to his webpage that shows a step by
step<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.250> text<00:01:17.759> form

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.789 

we<00:01:21.180> have<00:01:21.329> to<00:01:21.420> do<00:01:21.509> two<00:01:21.720> things<00:01:21.750> here<00:01:22.290> we<00:01:22.409> have<00:01:22.590> to

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
we have to do two things here we have to

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.100 
we have to do two things here we have to
go<00:01:23.610> down<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.299> make<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:25.220> Windows<00:01:26.220> registry<00:01:27.110> file

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
go down and make a Windows registry file

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.539 
go down and make a Windows registry file
I<00:01:28.140> guess<00:01:28.470> what<00:01:28.649> you'd<00:01:28.770> call<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.220> then<00:01:29.310> we<00:01:29.369> have

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
I guess what you'd call and then we have

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.370 
I guess what you'd call and then we have
to<00:01:29.700> go<00:01:29.790> ahead<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.119> make<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.299> manifest<00:01:30.840> file<00:01:31.080> and

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
to go ahead and make a manifest file and

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.460 
to go ahead and make a manifest file and
stick<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:33.000> folder<00:01:33.539> where<00:01:34.200> our

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
stick it in the folder where our

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.319 
stick it in the folder where our
application<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.310> now<00:01:35.789> I'm<00:01:35.939> going<00:01:36.149> to<00:01:36.210> show

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
application is now I'm going to show

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.420 
application is now I'm going to show
this<00:01:36.509> demonstration<00:01:37.049> for<00:01:37.409> Photoshop<00:01:37.979> but

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
this demonstration for Photoshop but

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.679 
this demonstration for Photoshop but
this<00:01:38.549> actually<00:01:38.789> works<00:01:39.149> for<00:01:39.270> all<00:01:39.539> the

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
this actually works for all the

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.529 
this actually works for all the
applications<00:01:40.100> you<00:01:41.100> see<00:01:41.490> here<00:01:42.030> are<00:01:42.210> all<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
applications you see here are all the

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.169 
applications you see here are all the
Adobe<00:01:42.869> applications<00:01:43.640> so<00:01:44.640> here<00:01:44.789> we<00:01:44.880> go<00:01:44.970> so

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
Adobe applications so here we go so

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:48.200 
Adobe applications so here we go so
first<00:01:45.659> step<00:01:45.899> we<00:01:46.259> want<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.530> go<00:01:46.909> Windows<00:01:47.909> button

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
first step we want to go Windows button

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.380 
first step we want to go Windows button
in<00:01:48.509> R<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.580> that's<00:01:50.580> going<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.850> bring<00:01:51.030> up<00:01:51.179> our

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
program folder or application is so

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.090 
program folder or application is so
basically<00:03:19.230> how<00:03:19.410> this<00:03:19.590> works<00:03:19.650> is<00:03:20.160> this<00:03:21.950> here<00:03:22.950> is
