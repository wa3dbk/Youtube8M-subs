00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:12.640
 on August 8, 1981 in bing in a 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.910
 small rural town located near

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.660
 miami 1000 master tournament the player 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.300
 Swiss surprised everyone was not for a 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.790
 masterful move nor for having raised a 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.700
 new face 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:46.030
 before the sight of all he exhibited his side 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.340
 more human and full of anger was destroying his 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.170
 racket 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.600
 these images went around the world 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.949
 and the former world number one was 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.949
 new news 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:07.240
 and then at press conference to mode 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.910
 of justification declared the last year 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:14.280
 it was complicated for me thank God 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.280
 finished the cement season 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.229
 actually federer by shredding his 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:25.860
 racket did nothing but return to his 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:29.039
 child's sources was exaggeratedly 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.170
 competitive and it was feared that his character 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:33.860
 irascible complicate your future 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.860
 sports 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.819
 Y 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.920
 At age 16, she abandons her studies and 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.020
 he decides to concentrate only on his career 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.360
 tennis 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.820
 He had great aptitudes for 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.370
 sports but nobody suspected that in it 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.740
 there was still a predestined player to 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.330
 the glory 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:52.330
 his character by then was still 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.330
 indomitable 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:05.140
 Roger Federer wanted everything and for that 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:09.379
 he had to reinvent himself had to change 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.769
 I just had to do it and really what 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:11.769
 did 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:26.049
 on July 2, 2001 the Swiss give his 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:30.599
 first blow in history and dethrones

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.840
 world 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:28.130
 federer begins to be synonymous with 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:30.560
 elegance of distinction in each of 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.680
 their presentations destroys their 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:38.120
 rivals with courtesy and also in a way 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:42.140
 cavalry does not suffer does not feel does not scream 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:46.280
 do not smile do not cry to defeat exaggerate 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:48.750
 Victory turns superiority into 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.890
 refinement 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.440
 and his mature and serene temperament 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:58.960
 it amazes the whole world 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.960

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.009
