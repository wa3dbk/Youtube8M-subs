parking<00:02:23.470> pad<00:02:23.790> I'm<00:02:24.790> looking<00:02:25.209> forward

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
parking pad I'm looking forward

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:35.339 
parking pad I'm looking forward
just<00:02:27.940> seeing<00:02:28.270> how<00:02:29.230> it<00:02:30.989> changes<00:02:34.200> yeah<00:02:35.200> we're

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
just seeing how it changes yeah we're

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.979 
just seeing how it changes yeah we're
going<00:02:35.470> to<00:02:35.530> be<00:02:35.620> cutting<00:02:35.800> the<00:02:36.630> edge<00:02:37.630> here

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
going to be cutting the edge here

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.240 
going to be cutting the edge here
further<00:02:38.560> in<00:02:38.800> so<00:02:39.099> it<00:02:39.220> stays<00:02:39.569> closer<00:02:40.569> in<00:02:40.930> on<00:02:41.319> our

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
further in so it stays closer in on our

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.729 
further in so it stays closer in on our
side<00:02:42.640> of<00:02:42.849> the<00:02:43.000> wall<00:02:43.630> this<00:02:43.930> year<00:02:44.200> so<00:02:44.350> that<00:02:44.500> next

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
side of the wall this year so that next

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.729 
side of the wall this year so that next
spring<00:02:45.310> more<00:02:46.239> leaves<00:02:46.900> will<00:02:47.290> grow<00:02:47.500> on<00:02:47.560> the

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
spring more leaves will grow on the

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.130 
spring more leaves will grow on the
inside<00:02:48.100> rather<00:02:48.280> than<00:02:48.430> on<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.700> outside<00:02:49.150> and

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
inside rather than on the outside and

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.720 
inside rather than on the outside and
it'll<00:02:50.290> be<00:02:50.410> thinner<00:02:50.709> which<00:02:51.040> will<00:02:51.370> be<00:02:51.459> okay<00:02:51.700> I

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
it'll be thinner which will be okay I

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.420 
it'll be thinner which will be okay I
guess<00:02:51.970> so<00:02:52.720> we<00:02:52.959> just<00:02:52.989> have<00:02:53.170> to<00:02:53.380> deal<00:02:54.069> with<00:02:54.280> this

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
guess so we just have to deal with this

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.509 
guess so we just have to deal with this
winter<00:02:54.850> being<00:02:55.390> a<00:02:55.690> little<00:02:55.989> bit<00:02:56.140> sparse<00:02:57.010> but<00:02:57.340> hey
