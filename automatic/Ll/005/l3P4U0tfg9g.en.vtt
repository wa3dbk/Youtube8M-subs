00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.419
 have both the lg optimus l5 2 and the 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.039
 samsung galaxy core recently reviewed 

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:12.839
 and both are already interesting by and 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:14.730
 Phones in this video we go is even 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:16.379
 compare with the device 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.179
 price difference of around 40 euros that 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.070
 team itself also has two costs 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:22.259
 about 140 euros while the galaxy core they 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.339
 than 80 euros 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:24.960
 even quite a difference and old 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:26.789
 specifications vary a bit 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.589
 in this video we will talk about it 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.259
 which you can buy to better 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:33.000
 lg optimus l5 2 is slightly smaller 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:34.560
 a 4.0 inch screen 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.450
 opposite a 4.3 inch screen in the 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.010
 dead I score resolution of two 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.810
 screen is the same screen technique that 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.850
 also uses the same 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:45.270
 both devices also have 5 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.630
 megapixel camera on the optimus l5 2 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.010
 nfc the galaxy core does not have that 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.780
 the of yourself has two has one 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.370
 single core processor but with one 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.150
 what powerful core of the dual core 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.320
 processor of the galaxy core 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.150
 so the differences are not very serious 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.140
 large except that processor 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.570
 but we will in this video 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.410
 of course all come back in terms of 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.690
 design 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.510
 both devices are a bit on the 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.800
 boring side is the lg that is reasonable 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.080
 tight 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.850
 not ugly and is simply good 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.850
 each other but it's a bit of a site 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.190
 device would not be something ugly either 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.600
 reasonable in each other also a bit boring 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.659
 and a bit less tight a bit more 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.490
 completed and we are a little less fan there 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.900
 of an additional disadvantage of the Samsung 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.000
 is that back of a bit 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.770
 is sticky along a plastic while 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.180
 the lg optimus l5 2 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.260
 a double pattern and back 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.360
 has because it is more pleasant 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.150
 then holds the back of the 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.070
 samsung galaxy core but screen they are 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.440
 both with a bvg screens 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.270
 equipped 480 by 800 pixels 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.090
 the samsung galaxy core just a little bigger 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.020
 evil screen further they do not differ 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.400
 once a lot 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.070
 what is striking is that color reproduction 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.210
 rather different from that of the galaxy 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.680
 core that is leaking 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.070
 a little less natural than the 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.299
 optimus l5 2 case optimus l5 2 fl er 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.150
 to somewhat less high contrast 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.340
 galaxy core so there are 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.770
 some differences but both are reasonable 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.929
 good screens for this segment at the 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.240
 TFT panels gauge short slightly better 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.130
 angle of 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.260
 good is not really a clear winner 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.940
 in pointing at the screens we are 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.800
 just satisfied with it 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.790
 in terms of interface, it is striking that the galaxy core 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.010
 of course the touchwiz interface 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.750
 from samsung which is very extensive 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.460
 offers a lot of functions 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.710
 bombastic is also a lot of software 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.510
 is installed on and therefore also 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.850
 the device somewhat delayed 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.030
 the optimus l5 2 this party is 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.920
 not very clean and fast on is also 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.770
 quite a bit of added erosion 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.290
 but slightly less extensive and what 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.210
 more useful additions than 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.470
 addition that samsung has done that 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.420
 sometimes useful sometimes also 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.640
 awkward and a bit hit or miss 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.870
 ck does seems a little better about 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.000
 thought 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.890
 so the interface of the lg optimus l5 2 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.760
 cm slightly more charmed than the 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.200
 samsung 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.760
 they then start looking at the performance 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.950
 if he says that samsung is not there 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.330
 petrus stem is a duo core processor 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.370
 opposite a single core processor 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.080
 the lg the lg that has one 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.450
 mediatek processor with a poor cortex a9 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.150
 core and that cortex is a9 core too 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.660
 clearly a much more powerful i can than 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.660
 two cortex 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.160
 5 cores that are in this galaxy core 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.050
 I think they are about the same 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.060
 in terms of performance in base mark 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.310
 the optimus l5 2 even scored slightly 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.140
 better for my eyebrows too she is the 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.510
 optimus over has two faster than 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.400
 the galaxy core but if you are a little heavier 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.780
 applications involves launching to the count 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.520
 you are going to do things then the galaxy 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.500
 core is a small advantage 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.280
 so in terms of performance is a bit about it 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.650
 moment and looked score is in the deals 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.720
 enemy optimus l5 2 also with the optimus 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.130
 l5 2 also slightly changes 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.330
 on the device button layout 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.709
 for example, otherwise is not entirely 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.740
 same device more 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.330
 I am I see choir is the case 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.950
 so in any case both devices are 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.090
 also available in duosim variants as 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.560
 you want that 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.930
 which one would you then take? 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.610
 the lg optimus 11 really just that 40 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.260
 euro is cheaper and has very little 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.060
 has disadvantages compared to the galaxy 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
 core even has an advantage in an nfc 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.480
 who 's in it 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.480
 advantage in slightly better design and 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.230
 as far as we are concerned galaxy core die 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.239
 has some large screens and 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.220
 therefore an advantage is perhaps 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.359
 in terms of speed just a little bit better than you 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.530
 is available on all makes 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.810
 it doesn't even matter that much 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.549
 and well then 40 euros is quite a lot 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.139
 but by the optimus l5 2 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.750
 as far as we are concerned a better permit is of 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:27.310
 these two overs over the camera just a moment 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.500
 but he is almost 5 megapixels 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.880
 camera but at the church score slightly 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.560
 better so still an advantage of 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.449
 not, but still with it 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.260
 not with the optimus l5 2 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.260
 in terms of price-quality ratio
