00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.300
 see how many machines lined up 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:17.180
 garage door 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.180
 machine like all need repair 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.779
 it's also hard 1 max max small 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.600
 typewriter 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.600
 even the body of the hajj burner 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:35.239
 idea you need to make yourself a robot parrot 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:38.870
 the machine hastened its secret to 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:43.520
 underground laboratory took us 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:46.100
 huge monster truck needles picker 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:50.530
 is very deep underground to 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.530
 no one could distract her from work 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.180
 well here we are at the bottom up 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.250
 near 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:06.180
 in order to create a robot assistant 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.790
 need to come up with it and for this machine 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.090
 for require for wander it with chalk 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.090
 on the board 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:21.620
 this robot is too bulky and awkward 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.620
 It seems this option does not fit 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:32.120
 the robot should be more flexible scrobbler 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.120
 on to move around the garage easily 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.869
 it's too unstable and flexible arms 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.500
 not strong enough 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.500
 need to think more 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.420
 need he had strong hands behind 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:54.600
 take a little cars and 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:56.070
 carry heavy weights 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.429
 what do you need 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.429
 Now you can start the simulation and 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:11.390
 this is a computer doctor machine you are here she 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.390
 can draw a model of a robot 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.900
 modeling is a very difficult task 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:23.970
 machine speed up like her 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:28.459
 it turns out great she finished and 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.459
 it's time to send the model to print 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.920
 a locksmith of any markets he can create 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.100
 details of the robot that shred 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.320
 drew on the computer 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:44.160
 This process is not fast but very 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:46.890
 carefully that's ready the body of the robot 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:53.910
 Now you can proceed to build while 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:57.890
 The rest of the details are printed. 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:01.440
 place to build fit 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:04.880
 It seems everything turns out and an ambulance machine 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:08.490
 you will be an assistant and in the meantime 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.790
 the last detail was printed is the head 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.790
 the robot 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.240
 but 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:21.150
 and here is a fully assembled robot throughout 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:24.819
 kaze thawed ready for the first inclusion 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.719
 typewriters and very much had them rather 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.719
 turn it on 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:37.260
 it's incredible it works and it looks like 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:40.810
 ready to take up his duties 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:44.519
 look how strong he is 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:48.280
 one can move cars a 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.060
 plow collapsible sorted out the boxes and 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.200
 crates 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:56.590
 now the garage is all in its place 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:00.000
 of course he is kind and cheerful and can 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.859
 have fun with the machine 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.959
 effect machines who can do a lot 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:06.959
 good bye bye
