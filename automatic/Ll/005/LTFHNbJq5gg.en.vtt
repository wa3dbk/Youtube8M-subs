00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello everyone not so long ago I did everything about 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.089
 diablo in which changed reality 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.330
 now the world is ruined 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.980
 Well, it is not the essence of the diablo 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.840
 pioneer genre hack &amp; slash 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.849
 after its appearance, the developers have become 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.010
 actively exploit promising and 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.869
 at that time not busy shoes in 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.539
 result in a lot of them like 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.000
 informally called diablo claude about them 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.699
 now and let's talk leave tossy 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.720
 and deep reasoning for everything about a here 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:33.989
 briefly clear and accessible well begin oh yes 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.410
 this is not the top but the list here and it doesn't matter who 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.059
 after whom both grandfather and before whom you find 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.910
 The reduction is allowed by the German company 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.320
 ascaron March 23rd, 2004 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.120
 the game is pretty 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.039
 decent diablo which us 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.719
 provided indecently huge on that 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.180
 time open petal downloads 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.770
 besides killing passages 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.379
 all sorts of fantasy creatures and 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.570
 the tasks in the game attended 6 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.059
 classes + 2 add-ons underworld 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.129
 and 5 difficulty levels named after 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.610
 precious metal bronze silver 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.020
 gold platinum and niobium are hidden 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.990
 German humor is present 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.930
 the developers are Germans and not in this game 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.479
 no smokes probably four years later 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.159
 from the same company we had agricultural 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.799
 under the heading fallen angel 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.270
 which took ambiguously with one 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.189
 the parties criticized the flaw 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.869
 innovations and on the other praised for 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.580
 huge world and excellent humor 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.950
 what was the class guardian worth 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.970
 represented by 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.549
 high-tech analogue of anubis 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.250
 also went addition people with blood 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.020
 made a new class and locations for hiding 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.329
 loved to write books since big 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.549
 Vertov space for fantasy and more 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.770
 six years later from another studio 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.960
 came the third part but it was no longer 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.850
 sokrat and this kate engine hunter 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.390
 oriented to hear more than 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.329
 lpg 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.220
 for which tayton was criticized 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.110
 quest from any game in the genre of hack and 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.030
 slash should be any feature 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.250
 otherwise it just gets lost among its 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.470
 Relatives of this game are gameplay 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.510
 there are no mechanics of features as such 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.400
 except that in the beginning we do not choose 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.950
 character class and subsequently hurt 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.910
 develop it as we wish its main 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.640
 difference from others 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.710
 style all surround weapons 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.260
 opponents are made in the style of the ancient 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.420
 of the ancient world in particular its mythology 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.490
 there were echoes here 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.190
 Greek culture and the Sumerians 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.380
 Egyptians and Chinese with the Mongols world 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.170
 divided into three large areas greece 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.810
 Egypt and the East all by itself require 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.330
 from the final game we can climb olimp 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.959
 it was developed by iron lore 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.930
 entertainment and released in 2006 June 26 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.820
 am two years later the supplement came out 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.070
 immortal throne adding fourth 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.730
 act and standard things to complement 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.190
 such a game 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.920
 and on this e3 version was announced 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.959
 games for ios and android platforms which 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.580
 will come out somewhere in the fall melon or was 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.470
 adventures of van helsing 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.540
 Van Helsing's incredible adventures 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.660
 developed a company not a car games and 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.450
 released relatively recently in 2013 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.560
 the success of the game exceeded expectations 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.200
 developers and the whole thing in 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.840
 subsequently turned into a trilogy of games and 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.190
 as one could understand from the title for no 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.760
 not for van Helsing 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:17.700
 this is a turn for his son 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.890
 also name is van helsing here it is a turn 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.630
 throughout the adventures of us 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.700
 will accompany the ghost of a certain lady 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.989
 Catharines that not only fly 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.239
 sell items in the shop 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.160
 but fighting for us the first part is not 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.930
 very different average 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.519
 diablo and giving we walked along 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.140
 surroundings fictional east and 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.360
 European side barkavi emission 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.760
 different creatures and completing quests that 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.350
 were the main feature of the game they were 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.810
 funny and original 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.790
 developers have created and such parodies on 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.590
 dark gothic stories in which on 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.080
 every step was ironic 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.330
 especially in the dialogues for this heyting and 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.400
 loved in the second part which came out 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.190
 a year later we were expected to be quite weighty 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.720
 innovations besides mini-games like tower 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.120
 defense allowed us to command 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.110
 by the militia and send them to perform 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.480
 different missions 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.880
 given their specificity and characteristics 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.650
 squad in particular the captain as well 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.420
 There were classes that were not in the first 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.400
 parts 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.720
 in the third part, their number increased to 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.000
 6 a game 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.860
 simplified throughout the trilogy were 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.570
 interesting locations for research 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.169
 which beauty could contend with 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.209
 by many 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.190
 the last part of the trilogy came out in this 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.889
 year just a month ago 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.660
 torchlight is a special diablo clone 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:29.090
 because people who created it did 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.250
 original diablo i and diablo 2 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.980
 so that experienced people were at the helm 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.290
 accurate was in many ways similar to diablo not 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.290
 only the gameplay but also the plot and filing in 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:42.139
 In general, the first part saw the light in 2009 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:45.650
 October 27th and we could choose one of 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:47.990
 three characters just like 1 diablo on 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.610
 on threw in the town of twilight and we 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.139
 were forced to wade through the levels 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.780
 dungeon final cart 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.760
 just like in the first deal.by but town 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.960
 This was on the mountain and the plot was spinning sky 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.240
 circle of angels and demons 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.550
 and around a certain crystal ibera 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.320
 who worked on all the living things in 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.300
 Subsequently, one of the main characters under 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.700
 influenced by the ancient powers of the mighty creature 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.860
 with ginger goes crazy and starts 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.690
 destroy all that video just like in 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.650
 diablo 2 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.479
 the feature of the game was a cartoon 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.330
 clearance while in the game was a lot 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:19.490
 blood and even dismemberment we had 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.870
 a pet that attacked opponents and 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.120
 lugging extra loot 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.010
 side quests nooks dungeon 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.620
 styling pronounced steampunk 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:31.729
 it all made that person famous and 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:34.190
 already in 2012 September 20th reservation games 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:36.470
 released the territory in swimming seconds 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:39.530
 increased now we ran and on 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.419
 surfaces like guess where of course 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.270
 well hidden go bumbo 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:45.979
 4 new classes new enemies and everything in it 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.070
 spirit to the fixer 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:50.750
 was released on October 23, 2013 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:52.640
 pretty decent representative of the genre 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.800
 hack and slash but nothing special as 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.020
 previous games in the video does not stand out 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.810
 with the exception of some nuances 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.060
 Firstly the game fritupley but also enriches 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.680
 developers through microtransactions 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.930
 affecting the appearance 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.789
 secondly when you see for the first time 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:11.090
 skill tree you can go crazy 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:13.850
 over a thousand passive skills in third 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.449
 there is no gold in the game instead of currency 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.430
 items 

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:18.650
 active same skills appear 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.020
 attributing gems to weapons or armor 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.120
 and subsequently improves with the player 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.830
 one could play for seven different 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.440
 classes one of which opened 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.900
 subsequently took her pretty well 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:33.259
 and gambling magazine called her even better 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:36.110
 role-playing game of 2014 in general is all 

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:38.120
 if i miss any important game in 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.039
 what kind of hack and slash 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.440
 in the comment well, subscribe not 

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:45.050
 forget still put your finger up well 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.630
 you know the procedure in my opinion i am when 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.860
 you already said or not yes and it does not matter 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:56.410
 at last 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:56.410
 there is both phobia fear fear cool adios
