00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.520 
annoying and I guess a lot of Illinois
right<00:02:05.790> on<00:02:05.970> so<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.720> can<00:02:06.840> put<00:02:06.930> in<00:02:07.080> a<00:02:07.140> mitigation

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
right on so you can put in a mitigation

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.620 
right on so you can put in a mitigation
system<00:02:08.100> and<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.310> takes<00:02:08.550> care<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.330> but<00:02:09.540> it

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
system and it takes care of it but it

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.170 
system and it takes care of it but it
takes<00:02:09.929> not<00:02:10.619> only<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.860> while<00:02:11.130> to<00:02:11.430> get<00:02:11.550> install

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
takes not only a while to get install

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.050 
takes not only a while to get install
but<00:02:12.450> then<00:02:12.630> a<00:02:12.810> while<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.530> do<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.070> test<00:02:14.370> like<00:02:14.790> to

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
but then a while to do a test like to

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.520 
but then a while to do a test like to
liken<00:02:15.420> are<00:02:15.630> from<00:02:15.810> like<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:15.959> couple<00:02:16.350> days<00:02:16.500> to

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
liken are from like a couple days to

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.970 
liken are from like a couple days to
seven<00:02:17.250> days<00:02:17.430> for<00:02:18.420> them<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.600> test<00:02:18.990> to<00:02:19.770> make<00:02:19.800> sure

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
seven days for them to test to make sure

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.730 
seven days for them to test to make sure
that's<00:02:20.400> mitigated<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.030> radon<00:02:21.450> correctly<00:02:21.990> and

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
that's mitigated the radon correctly and

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.070 
that's mitigated the radon correctly and
at<00:02:23.100> that<00:02:23.250> time<00:02:23.310> we<00:02:23.940> basically<00:02:24.420> had<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.720> 30

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
at that time we basically had the 30

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.660 
at that time we basically had the 30
days<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:25.650> close<00:02:25.860> we<00:02:26.130> couldn't<00:02:26.400> really<00:02:26.490> go

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
days to close we couldn't really go

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.340 
days to close we couldn't really go
beyond<00:02:26.910> that<00:02:26.940> because<00:02:27.240> I<00:02:27.480> we<00:02:27.870> need<00:02:28.020> to<00:02:28.110> be<00:02:28.230> in

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
beyond that because I we need to be in

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.710 
beyond that because I we need to be in
Illinois<00:02:28.760> to<00:02:29.760> go<00:02:29.880> to<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.030> doctor<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.570> then

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
Illinois to go to the doctor and then

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.680 
Illinois to go to the doctor and then
also<00:02:31.160> our<00:02:32.160> house<00:02:32.310> Michigan<00:02:32.760> had<00:02:32.940> sold<00:02:33.180> in<00:02:33.480> less

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
also our house Michigan had sold in less

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.900 
also our house Michigan had sold in less
than<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:33.959> week<00:02:34.010> so<00:02:35.010> it's<00:02:35.160> just<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.340> crazy<00:02:35.610> crazy

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
than a week so it's just a crazy crazy

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.540 
than a week so it's just a crazy crazy
time<00:02:36.300> so<00:02:36.870> up<00:02:37.200> to<00:02:37.530> like<00:02:37.769> a<00:02:37.800> whole<00:02:38.040> video<00:02:38.220> on<00:02:38.370> it

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
time so up to like a whole video on it

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.570 
time so up to like a whole video on it
when<00:02:38.640> I<00:02:38.700> don't<00:02:38.820> have<00:02:38.910> like<00:02:39.060> kids<00:02:40.580> rolling

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
probably would be a little bit more

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.860 
probably would be a little bit more
expensive<00:03:13.090> but<00:03:14.640> almost<00:03:15.640> three<00:03:16.000> times<00:03:16.210> what<00:03:16.780> it

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
expensive but almost three times what it

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.330 
expensive but almost three times what it
cost<00:03:16.900> us<00:03:17.320> to<00:03:17.350> get<00:03:17.590> our<00:03:17.620> house<00:03:17.830> painted<00:03:18.250> in

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340

limits of chicago or anything I mean
we're<00:03:25.840> on<00:03:25.960> the<00:03:26.460> outskirts<00:03:27.460> so<00:03:27.880> it's<00:03:28.210> just<00:03:28.630> it's

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
we're on the outskirts so it's just it's

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.840 
we're on the outskirts so it's just it's
a<00:03:29.350> higher<00:03:29.530> price<00:03:29.830> of<00:03:30.070> living<00:03:30.190> over<00:03:30.490> here<00:03:30.520> for

a higher price of living over here for

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.100 
a higher price of living over here for
sure<00:03:31.000> even<00:03:31.330> though<00:03:31.420> we<00:03:31.570> were<00:03:31.660> in<00:03:31.810> Metro

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
sure even though we were in Metro

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.580 
sure even though we were in Metro
Detroit<00:03:32.140> before<00:03:33.840> but<00:03:34.840> i<00:03:34.870> think<00:03:35.170> that<00:03:35.260> people

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
Detroit before but i think that people

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.440 
Detroit before but i think that people
are<00:03:35.830> just<00:03:36.070> more<00:03:36.400> eager<00:03:36.610> to<00:03:36.850> work<00:03:37.000> over<00:03:37.300> there

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
are just more eager to work over there

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.990 
are just more eager to work over there
and<00:03:37.570> they<00:03:37.630> did<00:03:37.780> an<00:03:37.870> excellent<00:03:38.140> job<00:03:38.350> but<00:03:38.830> a<00:03:39.430> lot

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
and they did an excellent job but a lot

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.690 
and they did an excellent job but a lot
less<00:03:40.360> expensive<00:03:40.830> for<00:03:41.830> their<00:03:41.950> will<00:03:42.130> say<00:03:42.400> it<00:03:42.520> so

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
less expensive for their will say it so

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.550 
less expensive for their will say it so
