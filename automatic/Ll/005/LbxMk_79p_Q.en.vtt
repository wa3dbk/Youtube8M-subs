00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:11.400
 Yes Hello storm field name is a cross-shaped part 2 at a stretch align oll Yes 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:15.299
 This time I would like this to do this and referred to in this figure 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:20.710
 Last time this is this time this is the same shape 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:23.320
 If you look only at this upper side, it is wrong when you look at the side 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.920
 Well this is this 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:35.730
 Like this Well 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:37.260
 Or the form of the left side speed people after the left of the plane when it brought the four of mass in the upper left corner there is this yellow 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:43.250
 Should I try that? 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.250
 This is on the right when brought to the right the last time 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:52.130
 It is not on the left even if brought to the upper left of the ole 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:55.490
 The fact that yes I think much kana should I Miwakere with it 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.970
 Let's get it all together 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.970
 1 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.480
 shop 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.600
 Nana 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:19.970
 How about 8 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:29.510
 Zodiac This just alternates the left block up and down 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:31.840
 After that, I only have you to turn the upper face clockwise here is only the first floor, it is the second floor 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.829
 After that say 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:41.350
 It's only easy, isn't it okay? 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:41.950
 In to practice First of all I'd been the last time Iwase, is not it do not have to make this form 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.200
 Or 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:50.439
 I think that I explain how to make this form 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.830
 Even though I did this last time and this time 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:55.700
 Well make it the way 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:58.960
 In the meanwhile, I hope this is all right 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.960
 In a state of alignment 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.780
 Follow 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.659
 Last part 1- I would like to create this form 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:12.420
 To make 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:15.830
 Yes I will do this in this way 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.830
 Let's wait and see 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:38.980
 I can say that you can do it like this 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:45.870
 Yes I went , and I guess this is how to practice the last turn 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.870
 And now I 'm going in this state how to turn it last time 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:59.150
 Yes 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:03.630
 If it does, it will be this form that I did this time 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:07.080
 I wonder if it's a deficit If you're from the town you can quickly learn 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:10.800
 I think it's easy, yes 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:15.540
 It is more than saying that it is feeling 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.120
 Align the top at once oll 4-10 o'clock part 2 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.960
 Could 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.000
 so 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:26.460
 It says home yeah 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:30.710
 I think that I want to do, I think trying to do this the cross-shaped This 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.710
 Let's do the Redic Cube again next time
