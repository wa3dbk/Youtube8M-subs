 video for my blog at www logical point 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.320
 dot net today I will teach how 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.690
 download windows 10 completely 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.460
 official from the microsoft page what 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.360
 first thing we're going to do is go to this 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.920
 internet page 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.140
 I'm going to leave the link in the description 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.330
 of the video once entered we load 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.400
 this page we are going to go here 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.620
 down here we have two links of 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.810
 downloads this is not going to be the system 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.880
 operative windows 10 but what we 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.460
 will download here is a manager of 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.229
 downloads which with that manager we are going to 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.540
 can download our windows 10 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.899
 official we have to choose between the 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.549
 32 or 64 bit version I repeat this not 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:13.049
 is going to be the windows 10 operating system 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.040
 but what we have to select 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.020
 here is the download manager based on 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.909
 what operating system are we in these 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.140
 moments using as I am 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.960
 using windows 7 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.150
 64 bits I'm going to use this link to 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.950
 downloading the tool there you create the 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.619
 download box where it will lower us 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.040
 an executable with the name mediacreate 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.960
 jon tools for the 64-bit version 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.390
 it weighs a little more than 18 megabytes and what 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.250
 download to our computer 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.800
 once downloaded we double- click 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.290
 and this window opens which we 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.509
 ask if we want to update the pc is 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.759
 say step on the operating system that 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.149
 we have currently in my case windows 7 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.070
 or if we want to create an iso for 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.610
 install the operating system on a dvd 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.420
 or through a pendrive in another computer 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.399
 just what I'm going to do in this 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.979
 tutorial is to download the iso for 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.960
 burn it on a dvd and then use that dvd 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.090
 to install the operating system in a 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.640
 management team this second option 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.680
 I go next and here I am asked 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.110
 language edition and architecture 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.290
 Now Windows operating system 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.970
 10 in my case I will select Spanish 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.680
 they are in all languages ​​within 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.610
 edition we have all editions 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.670
 available 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.980
 I'm going to use the 10 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.459
 and within architecture we can choose 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.980
 the 32 or 64 bit version or download 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.950
 a unique one made with both architectures 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.810
 in my case I will use the 64 bit 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.360
 once we choose the three parameters 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.880
 we give it to next as in the first 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.489
 window I did not want to update my equipment 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.260
 but I wanted to download the system 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.950
 operative to then install it in another 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.900
 team 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.150
 in this third step he asks us if 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.120
 we want to load it to a usb flash drive 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.190
 or if we want to generate the iso file 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.769
 to then use software that 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.209
 let burn that made on a dvd 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.040
 I'm going to use that second option 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.590
 but we could also download it 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.630
 directly on a usb drive we give it 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.519
 next and it opens the window of 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.260
 scan to select in what 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.200
 location we want to download the image 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.460
 point iso I'm going to select the disk 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.920
 of and we keep there 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.620
 Once the download is complete, 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.360
 the verification process finally 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.220
 after checking 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.200
 the assistant tells us that it was already generated 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.510
 the point file did in the address 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.880
 specified above and the only 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.500
 option that gives us is to end if 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.810
 we go to this route by clicking here 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.120
 we see that we have the windows file 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.290
 iso point that contains the system 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.060
 operative windows 10 in 64 bits 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.640
 completely official downloaded 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.700
 directly from the microsoft site 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.770
 now it only remains to grab this iso and 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.050
 copy it through some program like 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.910
 for example the black express and of that 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.610
 way we would have the operating system 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.570
 on a DVD I hope you have served them 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.190
