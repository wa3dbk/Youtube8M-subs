00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 and let's do with you the third technique 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.770
 which is called post isometric 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:12.200
 muscle relaxation 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:14.429
 I think that before the video you already got 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.529
 specific clear definition of what it is 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.990
 how to do it so I will show 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:23.789
 only the technique itself we work with 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:28.230
 trapezius muscle in order to 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.230
 work vertical fibers 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:37.399
 trapezius muscles we will need 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:39.629
 so that the man hands brought the castle behind his head 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.050
 we fill it a little bit forward that is 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.969
 we get this design 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:49.399
 here we pass our hands here to the window 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:52.289
 between the shoulder and forearm we capture and 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:55.550
 first phase isometric phase 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.890
 stress please take a breath 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.809
 hold your breath and press your neck 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:07.549
 in your arms with such force 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:10.860
 hold for seven ten seconds 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:15.000
 slowly quietly exhale relax 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.970
 fully and here I am 2-3 centimeters 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.420
 I stretch my muscles a little bit 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:26.549
 farther inhale again 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:29.189
 man's breathing work back is no longer 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.280
 let us have every new position 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.009
 is the starting position for 2 3 and 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:40.189
 so on the track we exhale relax 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:44.630
 and you see that a person can go even further 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:47.070
 stretch the muscles and the third time block 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:52.580
 breath hold 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:02:00.440
 work exhale slowly calmly 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:02:02.970
 relax muscles from bream super farther 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.460
 back this constructor 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.250
 disassemble very slowly calmly 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.720
 there is a person must return to the original 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.290
 position will be different slowly 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.890
 unpleasant painful sensations clearly 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.490
 is back 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:21.860
 now let's work from the horizontal 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:25.100
 portions trapezius muscles for this 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:28.530
 let's we work with the right 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.780
 right side set on the topic 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.370
 set the left hand on the shoulder 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.420
 the joint is such or 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.610
 cross couple 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.130
 tilt your head and a little bit you can 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:46.080
 push the shoulder joint 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:48.810
 felt tension during tension 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:53.519
 courses by the way can be a little bit 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:56.820
 so here is the most painful search 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:59.390
 and position for the client and when his 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.340
 find a man to take a breath 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:08.280
 hold your breath and push the topic 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:12.870
 my palm and why the composition of Why 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:16.640
 up here is no such strength here 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:20.160
 excessive muscle tension just 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.739
 light tension of even one intention 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.440
 enough exhale relax and I 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.870
 stretch your muscles a bit for 20 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.549
 centimeters and it will be 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.890
 starting position for the second time 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:40.709
 breathing breath in work 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:43.049
 doing fine 7 10 seconds slow 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:46.380
 quietly exhale relax the muscles 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:49.100
 great attention you can move right 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:54.590
 in the eye neck in 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:57.410
 just looking for a centimeter back we return 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:01.370
 very easy and necessary if you 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.870
 did on the right be sure to do these 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:09.440
 same tricks on the left 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:14.530
 otherwise you will unbalance and easy 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:19.190
 when pulling the pro first to take a breath 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:24.400
 personally holding your breath working to win 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:27.140
 subject to my palm with such force well 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.770
 70 seconds hold the tension exhale 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:33.260
 relax and 23 centimeters i 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:37.520
 slightly stretch it will be new 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:42.160
 starting position inhale breath hold 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:44.210
 we work perfectly we keep everything for 10 seconds 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:49.120
 slowly restful 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.120
 relax and 2 thousand 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:57.090
 and return to the starting position here 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.280
 very important after this muscle 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:04.440
 recover in your physiological 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:07.820
 Talas can do kneading 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.820
 do kneading with forearms 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:27.860
 so i showed you three today 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:29.460
 way to work with trapezius muscle 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.800
 three ways 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.290
 remove the painful launchers so 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.750
 called trigger points from this 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.220
 muscle 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:41.220
 because you can apply all three 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:44.820
 techniques in one massage or their 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:48.360
 divide ie apply each session 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:50.640
 new technique so you get 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:56.700
 naturally very powerful fast 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:59.130
 result but in order to effect 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:02.330
 stayed long enough anyway 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:04.320
 you need to do a course of at least 10 procedures 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.190
 combine with classic examples 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.940
 massages 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:10.950
 with the massage you like but 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:16.650
 necessarily study the most muscular 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:20.820
 fabrics need and need see you in 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:23.700
 next video tutorial where we are already with you 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:26.580
 let's talk about straightening muscle 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:30.210
 spine and in the same way very 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:32.630
 let's find it in detail 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:36.140
 anatomical structure and naturally 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:40.100
 let's see how to work with this muscle 

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:40.100
 goodbye and see you
