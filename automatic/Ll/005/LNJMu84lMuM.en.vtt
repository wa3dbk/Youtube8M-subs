00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 We present you a video report on 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.099
 the exemplary test here is forcing out 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.650
 liquid roof composition quick repair 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.980
 at one of the objects of JSC Gazprom December 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.379
 year 2013 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.940
 I am not a city ​​to us 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.850
 demonstrated the consequences 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.710
 permanent roof leaks in the interior 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.099
 the premises of one of the technological 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.900
 constructions in our opinion practically 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.320
 It was the result of the appeared to 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.880
 the time of roofing defects and 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.270
 defects skylight designs 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.160
 on the roof of the building now we are on 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.190
 building roof 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.660
 air temperature + 1 degree Celsius 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.140
 the surface of the roof is wet in places 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.390
 covered with a water layer of the original 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.050
 the task was to waterproof the site 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.000
 roofs under a decorative lantern 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.340
 sediment condensate drained to the roof and 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.620
 penetrated inside the building through the cracks 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.960
 building construction and docking 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.180
 stitches when using traditional 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.869
 roof repair technology is necessary 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.729
 it would wait for dry and warm weather 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.330
 dry the problem area put 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.729
 primer 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.770
 and then use one of 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.840
 numerous roof mastic 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.180
 from our point of view in such cases 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.759
 much more efficient to use 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.850
 approximate water displacing composition 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.810
 liquid touches quick repair 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.330
 immediately produce the necessary 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.909
 repair do not postpone problems like this 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.130
 we are taken far to enter displacing 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.200
 polymer composition is a family 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.939
 materials that are equally good 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.579
 applied as dry 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.250
 so on the wet surface and even under 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.869
 a layer of water 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.250
 temperature range of their application from 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:49.439
 minus 10 to plus 50 degrees Celsius 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.350
 these materials contain 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.689
 input of a displacing additive as well 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.000
 primer necessary for quality 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.240
 roof coatings of all 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.520
 types 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.039
 on the repair area clearly visible 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.360
 wet spots through construction 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:09.590
 designs saturated with moisture sealing 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.380
 metal interface points 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.430
 construction and roofing material 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.349
 produced without prior 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.180
 drying 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:19.030
 at the same time the wet surface does not render 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.349
 no influence 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.400
 approximate composition easily penetrates to 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.910
 joints and slots 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.420
 forming an elastic film problem 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.760
 leakage 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.010
 solved in a few minutes even if 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.870
 the work is done by people who do not have 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.880
 special skills finishing repairs 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.040
 roofing inside the lantern 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.030
 we went to work in the open area 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.730
 roof roofing made of 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.329
 PVC film sheets connected between 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.980
 a special adhesive coating had 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.890
 mechanical defects 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.709
 damage has also been broken 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:01.269
 sealing seams in the area of ​​gutters and 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.269
 connections to the drain hole 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.910
 polymeric input displacing composition 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.549
 liquid roof quick repair was applied 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.650
 on wet places covered in puddles 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:15.920
 surface without prior 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.319
 training right on the wet while doing 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.600
 water was forced out by a special component 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.600
 part of the materials 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.240
 here 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.740
 repair of mechanical damage and 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.320
 punctures were carried out by gluing 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.900
 patches or a simple mask 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.720
 damaged area in the event that 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.600
 the size of the hole in the roof was less than five 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.130
 millimeters 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.400
 liquid roof fast repair 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.620
 this work in any weather quickly 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.710
 high quality with guaranteed 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.710
 the result 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.670
 and 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:05.810
 water displacing properties of polymer 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:07.979
 compositions well illustrated 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:11.090
 macro shot in the lab under 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:14.689
 microscope on the subject table 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.349
 metal plate is located 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:21.229
 wetting it with water 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:21.229
 process the wet surface of the composition 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:27.930
 applied material displaces water and 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:32.039
 evenly distributed over the surface 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:34.620
 metal so despite the extreme 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:38.120
 working conditions are formed reliably and 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.120
 moisture sheeting 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.949
 in addition to the liquid roof company nippon 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.439
 produces compounds 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:54.159
 liquid membrane liquid asphalt and liquid 

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:56.520
 locker these are water displacing polymeric 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:59.259
 protection compositions 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.020
 structures of buildings from various 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:03.240
 materials from environmental exposure 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.280
 Wednesday 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.879
 invite you to meet them on
