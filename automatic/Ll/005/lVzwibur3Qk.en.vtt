I<00:00:06.080> get<00:00:07.080> many<00:00:07.319> questions<00:00:07.589> about<00:00:07.950> should<00:00:08.760> I<00:00:08.790> buy

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
I get many questions about should I buy

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.959 
I get many questions about should I buy
a<00:00:09.059> large<00:00:09.389> diaphragm<00:00:10.019> or<00:00:10.230> small<00:00:10.830> diaphragm<00:00:11.250> mic

a large diaphragm or small diaphragm mic
the<00:00:12.960> answer<00:00:13.259> is<00:00:13.380> 100%<00:00:13.980> dependent<00:00:14.429> on<00:00:15.089> what

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
the answer is 100% dependent on what

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.540 
the answer is 100% dependent on what
you're<00:00:15.780> looking<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.170> do<00:00:16.350> with<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.010> microphone

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
you're looking to do with the microphone

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.370 
you're looking to do with the microphone
and<00:00:17.789> what<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:18.510> already<00:00:18.750> have<00:00:19.140> four

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
and what you already have four

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.609 
and what you already have four
microphones<00:00:19.680> in<00:00:20.100> your<00:00:20.430> mic<00:00:20.640> cabinet<00:00:21.619> let's

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
microphones in your mic cabinet let's

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.710 
microphones in your mic cabinet let's
first<00:00:22.920> describe<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.609> basics<00:00:24.090> about<00:00:24.210> these

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
first describe the basics about these

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.189 
first describe the basics about these
two<00:00:25.019> different<00:00:25.199> types<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.859> microphones<00:00:26.340> a

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
two different types of microphones a

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.349 
two different types of microphones a
wide<00:00:28.199> diaphragm<00:00:28.769> or<00:00:29.010> large<00:00:29.789> capsuled

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
wide diaphragm or large capsuled

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.870 
wide diaphragm or large capsuled
microphone<00:00:30.929> typically<00:00:31.769> has<00:00:31.980> about<00:00:32.009> one<00:00:32.640> inch

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
microphone typically has about one inch

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.170 
microphone typically has about one inch
diameter<00:00:33.149> surface<00:00:34.579> because<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.790> larger

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
diameter surface because of the larger

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.209 
diameter surface because of the larger
surface<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.870> will<00:00:37.050> respond<00:00:37.559> well<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.800> lower

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
surface it will respond well to lower

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.869 
surface it will respond well to lower
frequencies<00:00:38.910> producing<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.690> fuller<00:00:39.960> sound

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
frequencies producing a fuller sound

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.060 
frequencies producing a fuller sound
wide<00:00:41.879> diaphragms<00:00:42.480> are<00:00:42.750> fantastic<00:00:43.559> on<00:00:43.739> almost

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
wide diaphragms are fantastic on almost

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.850 
wide diaphragms are fantastic on almost
everything<00:00:44.700> from<00:00:44.879> drums<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.600> bass<00:00:45.809> amps<00:00:46.289> kusa

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
everything from drums to bass amps kusa

everything from drums to bass amps kusa
guitars<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.520> vocals<00:00:48.770> because<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:50.100> the

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
guitars and vocals because of the

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.520 
guitars and vocals because of the
smaller<00:00:50.550> diaphragm<00:00:51.210> pencil<00:00:51.989> mics<00:00:52.170> do<00:00:52.379> not

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
smaller diaphragm pencil mics do not

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.880 
smaller diaphragm pencil mics do not
respond<00:00:53.010> as<00:00:53.250> well<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.760> lower<00:00:53.969> frequencies<00:00:54.890> but

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
respond as well to lower frequencies but

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.340 
respond as well to lower frequencies but
they<00:00:56.489> work<00:00:56.789> well<00:00:57.090> with<00:00:57.120> higher<00:00:57.629> frequencies

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
they work well with higher frequencies

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.319 
they work well with higher frequencies
since<00:00:59.039> there<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.370> less<00:00:59.609> mass<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.210> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
since there is less mass to the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.290 
since there is less mass to the
diaphragm<00:01:01.219> you<00:01:02.219> could<00:01:02.370> use<00:01:02.579> them<00:01:02.760> on<00:01:02.969> anything

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
diaphragm you could use them on anything

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.450 
diaphragm you could use them on anything
but<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.140> will<00:01:04.290> notice<00:01:04.680> they<00:01:04.890> shine<00:01:05.250> on

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
but you will notice they shine on

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.550 
but you will notice they shine on
cymbals<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.180> instruments<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.930> do<00:01:07.049> not<00:01:07.229> want

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
cymbals and instruments you do not want

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.640 
cymbals and instruments you do not want
a<00:01:07.770> lot<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.010> low-end<00:01:08.280> on<00:01:09.170> so<00:01:10.170> let's<00:01:10.320> put<00:01:10.530> this

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
a lot of low-end on so let's put this

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.280 
a lot of low-end on so let's put this
into<00:01:10.860> context<00:01:11.600> let's<00:01:12.600> say<00:01:12.780> we're<00:01:12.990> going<00:01:13.200> to

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
into context let's say we're going to

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.160 
into context let's say we're going to
record<00:01:13.619> an<00:01:13.830> acoustic<00:01:14.400> guitar<00:01:14.430> if<00:01:15.299> it's<00:01:15.960> gonna

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
record an acoustic guitar if it's gonna

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.710 
record an acoustic guitar if it's gonna
be<00:01:16.409> an<00:01:16.530> acoustic<00:01:17.100> track<00:01:17.400> only<00:01:17.850> by<00:01:18.000> itself<00:01:18.390> or

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
be an acoustic track only by itself or

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.050 
be an acoustic track only by itself or
with<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:19.020> lead<00:01:19.320> vocal<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:20.009> choose<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.759> wide

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
with a lead vocal I choose a wide

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.980 
with a lead vocal I choose a wide
diaphragm<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:22.200> get<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> full<00:01:22.799> rich<00:01:23.400> sound<00:01:23.990> if

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
diaphragm to get a full rich sound if

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.810 
diaphragm to get a full rich sound if
it's<00:01:25.229> going<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.530> be<00:01:25.710> an<00:01:25.830> acoustic<00:01:26.310> guitar<00:01:26.610> with

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
it's going to be an acoustic guitar with

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.210 
it's going to be an acoustic guitar with
a<00:01:26.850> full<00:01:27.180> rock<00:01:27.420> band<00:01:27.720> I'd<00:01:28.080> use<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.950> pencil

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
a full rock band I'd use the pencil

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.749 
a full rock band I'd use the pencil
condenser<00:01:30.470> reason<00:01:31.470> being<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:32.040> don't<00:01:32.310> need<00:01:32.610> the

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
condenser reason being I don't need the

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.640 
condenser reason being I don't need the
low<00:01:32.939> end<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.600> really<00:01:33.930> need<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.229> brightness

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
low end and I really need the brightness

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.429 
low end and I really need the brightness
to<00:01:34.799> cut<00:01:34.979> through<00:01:35.280> over<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.759> rest<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.210> band

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
to cut through over the rest of the band

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.800 
to cut through over the rest of the band
if<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:38.130> use<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.579> large<00:01:38.790> diaphragm<00:01:39.450> for<00:01:39.630> this

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
if I use the large diaphragm for this

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.230 
if I use the large diaphragm for this
I'd<00:01:40.320> have<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.680> use<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.860> lot<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.159> EQ<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.850> get<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.119> to

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
I'd have to use a lot of EQ to get it to

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.859 
I'd have to use a lot of EQ to get it to
cut<00:01:42.450> through<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.810> mix<00:01:44.210> now<00:01:45.210> let's<00:01:45.450> say<00:01:45.659> we

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
cut through the mix now let's say we

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.450 
cut through the mix now let's say we
were<00:01:45.990> going<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.380> use<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.770> same<00:01:46.979> acoustic

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
were going to use the same acoustic

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.660 
were going to use the same acoustic
guitar<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:48.060> do<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.210> lead<00:01:48.509> on<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.869> rock<00:01:49.079> song<00:01:49.380> I

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
guitar to do a lead on the rock song I

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.910 
guitar to do a lead on the rock song I
might<00:01:50.670> move<00:01:50.880> over<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> large<00:01:51.960> diaphragm<00:01:52.409> to

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
might move over to a large diaphragm to

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.740 
might move over to a large diaphragm to
get<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.070> fuller<00:01:53.399> sound<00:01:53.729> on<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.240> individual

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
get a fuller sound on the individual

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.190 
get a fuller sound on the individual
notes<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.380> solo<00:01:56.450> using<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.540> pencil<00:01:57.810> might

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
notes of the solo using the pencil might

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.280 
notes of the solo using the pencil might
be<00:01:58.380> too<00:01:58.619> brittle<00:01:58.979> for<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.399> individual<00:01:59.939> notes

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
be too brittle for the individual notes

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.889 
be too brittle for the individual notes
