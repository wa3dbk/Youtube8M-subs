this so this is a hipster door a

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.390 
this so this is a hipster door a
three-high<00:00:20.600> expandable<00:00:21.600> hipster<00:00:22.170> door<00:00:22.400> so

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
three-high expandable hipster door so

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.120 
three-high expandable hipster door so
this<00:00:23.939> has<00:00:24.180> as<00:00:24.810> far<00:00:25.050> as<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.230> know<00:00:25.289> never<00:00:25.859> been

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
this has as far as I know never been

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.710 
this has as far as I know never been
done<00:00:26.279> before

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
done before

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.950 
done before
well<00:00:27.720> sort<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.890> has<00:00:29.220> been<00:00:29.519> done<00:00:29.699> where<00:00:30.150> it's

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
well sort of it has been done where it's

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.920 
well sort of it has been done where it's
like<00:00:31.140> three<00:00:31.890> wide<00:00:32.099> or<00:00:33.000> five<00:00:33.480> voids

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
like three wide or five voids

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.130 
like three wide or five voids
but<00:00:34.829> what<00:00:35.790> does<00:00:36.030> this<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.930> one<00:00:37.110> is

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
but what does this this one is

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.560 
but what does this this one is
expandable<00:00:38.070> lifting<00:00:38.520> one<00:00:38.820> yes<00:00:39.329> this

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
expandable lifting one yes this

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.650 
expandable lifting one yes this
protrusion<00:00:40.320> now<00:00:41.219> that's<00:00:42.180> up<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.450> think

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
protrusion now that's up you think

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.020 
protrusion now that's up you think
possible<00:00:43.379> because<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:44.430> best<00:00:44.610> thing<00:00:44.700> can<00:00:44.910> only

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
possible because the best thing can only

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.889 
possible because the best thing can only
push<00:00:45.329> 12<00:00:45.690> blocks<00:00:45.960> at<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.230> same<00:00:46.500> time<00:00:46.770> no<00:00:47.899> yeah

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
push 12 blocks at the same time no yeah

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.430 
push 12 blocks at the same time no yeah
I<00:00:48.930> don't<00:00:49.200> know<00:00:49.440> really<00:00:49.739> oh<00:00:50.100> really<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.449> think<00:00:51.719> is

see here now you might be saying to

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.760 
see here now you might be saying to
yourself<00:01:24.110> how<00:01:24.800> the<00:01:24.830> heck<00:01:25.610> did<00:01:25.850> we<00:01:26.030> do<00:01:26.210> this

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
yourself how the heck did we do this

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.500 
yourself how the heck did we do this
well

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
well

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.220 
well
drum<00:01:29.510> roll<00:01:29.690> always<00:01:30.190> okay<00:01:31.660> here<00:01:32.660> you<00:01:32.840> see<00:01:33.020> the

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 
drum roll always okay here you see the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.200 
drum roll always okay here you see the
concept<00:01:33.620> so<00:01:34.010> this<00:01:34.310> is<00:01:34.490> all<00:01:34.730> of<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:34.970> wiring

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
concept so this is all of the wiring

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.310 
concept so this is all of the wiring
it's<00:01:35.600> pretty<00:01:36.290> insane<00:01:36.800> and<00:01:37.160> huge<00:01:37.460> ins<00:01:37.670> things

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
it's pretty insane and huge ins things

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.760 
it's pretty insane and huge ins things
um<00:01:39.820> this<00:01:40.820> is<00:01:40.970> the<00:01:41.090> main<00:01:41.210> main<00:01:41.780> innovation<00:01:42.620> in

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
um this is the main main innovation in

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.660 
um this is the main main innovation in
this<00:01:43.840> particular<00:01:44.840> hipster<00:01:45.230> door<00:01:45.490> this<00:01:46.490> is<00:01:46.640> a

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
this particular hipster door this is a

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.070 
this particular hipster door this is a
piston<00:01:47.150> worm<00:01:47.770> two<00:01:48.770> of<00:01:48.890> them<00:01:49.180> so<00:01:50.180> if<00:01:50.540> we<00:01:50.810> fire

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
piston worm two of them so if we fire

00:01:51.080 --> 00:02:09.040 
piston worm two of them so if we fire
again<00:01:52.000> closing<00:01:53.800> yes

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.780 

either<00:02:09.290> this<00:02:09.530> is<00:02:09.679> work<00:02:09.860> that's<00:02:10.310> before<00:02:10.700> the

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
either this is work that's before the

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.920 
either this is work that's before the
repeaters<00:02:11.270> post<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:11.930> Pistons<00:02:12.350> like<00:02:12.590> that<00:02:13.930> and

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
repeaters post the Pistons like that and

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.000 
repeaters post the Pistons like that and
it's<00:02:15.590> over<00:02:15.920> and<00:02:16.489> then<00:02:17.260> blocks<00:02:18.260> are<00:02:18.470> down<00:02:18.650> and

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
it's over and then blocks are down and

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.380 
it's over and then blocks are down and
it's<00:02:19.160> done<00:02:19.400> so<00:02:20.290> timing<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.650> piston<00:02:22.040> one

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
it's done so timing the piston one

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.180 
it's done so timing the piston one
actually<00:02:23.390> took<00:02:23.720> more<00:02:24.440> than<00:02:24.650> half<00:02:24.890> of<00:02:25.010> the

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
actually took more than half of the

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.120 
actually took more than half of the
circuits<00:02:25.730> that's<00:02:26.480> all<00:02:27.020> over<00:02:27.170> there<00:02:27.440> lagging

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
circuits that's all over there lagging

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.510 
circuits that's all over there lagging
the<00:02:28.250> support<00:02:28.760> that's<00:02:29.239> that<00:02:30.130> so<00:02:31.130> what<00:02:31.280> we<00:02:31.310> have

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
the support that's that so what we have

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.330 
the support that's that so what we have
we<00:02:31.700> have<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:31.820> pattern<00:02:32.480> which<00:02:33.110> we<00:02:33.290> just<00:02:33.560> copied

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
we have a pattern which we just copied

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.310 
we have a pattern which we just copied
over<00:02:34.459> and<00:02:34.640> over<00:02:35.030> again<00:02:35.120> and<00:02:35.510> then<00:02:36.050> on<00:02:36.230> the

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
over and over again and then on the

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.870 
over and over again and then on the
bottom<00:02:36.440> it's<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.709> same<00:02:36.980> thing<00:02:37.280> just<00:02:37.489> together

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
bottom it's the same thing just together

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.449 
bottom it's the same thing just together
wait<00:02:38.090> around<00:02:38.270> so<00:02:38.450> we<00:02:38.660> can<00:02:38.810> push<00:02:38.989> it<00:02:39.020> back<00:02:39.459> so

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
wait around so we can push it back so

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.420 
wait around so we can push it back so
when<00:02:40.790> it's<00:02:40.910> opening<00:02:41.270> opens<00:02:42.070> first<00:02:43.070> it<00:02:43.250> goes

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
when it's opening opens first it goes

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.670 
when it's opening opens first it goes
like<00:02:43.970> your<00:02:44.120> rights<00:02:44.300> for<00:02:44.720> example<00:02:44.780> but<00:02:45.560> the

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
like your rights for example but the

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.440 
like your rights for example but the
next<00:02:45.860> time<00:02:45.950> you<00:02:46.010> open<00:02:46.100> its<00:02:46.310> most<00:02:46.520> left<00:02:46.910> so<00:02:47.390> it

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
next time you open its most left so it

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.850 
next time you open its most left so it
just<00:02:47.660> stays<00:02:47.840> on<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:48.200> side<00:02:48.380> where<00:02:48.650> it's<00:02:48.739> ended

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
just stays on the side where it's ended

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.180 
just stays on the side where it's ended
and<00:02:49.190> then<00:02:50.019> using<00:02:51.019> some<00:02:51.050> mechanics<00:02:51.650> we<00:02:51.860> send<00:02:52.070> on

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
and then using some mechanics we send on

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.440 
and then using some mechanics we send on
one<00:02:52.310> signals<00:02:52.700> through<00:02:52.910> that's<00:02:53.090> what<00:02:53.209> is<00:02:53.330> up

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
one signals through that's what is up

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.420 
one signals through that's what is up
here<00:02:53.750> power<00:02:54.290> of<00:02:54.380> particular<00:02:54.860> repeaters<00:02:55.280> in

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
here power of particular repeaters in

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:02.020 
here power of particular repeaters in
here<00:02:57.730> yes<00:02:58.760> yeah<00:02:59.300> well<00:03:00.580> exactly<00:03:01.580> the<00:03:01.730> way<00:03:01.850> we

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
here yes yeah well exactly the way we

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.600 
here yes yeah well exactly the way we
did<00:03:02.269> the<00:03:02.390> wiring<00:03:02.810> in<00:03:02.930> this<00:03:03.080> one<00:03:03.380> it's<00:03:03.709> maximum

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
did the wiring in this one it's maximum

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.920 
did the wiring in this one it's maximum
15<00:03:05.239> blocks<00:03:05.690> wide<00:03:05.959> but<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:08.030> council<00:03:08.269> concept

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
15 blocks wide but the council concept

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.160 
15 blocks wide but the council concept
with<00:03:09.470> these<00:03:09.800> piston<00:03:10.310> works<00:03:10.600> is<00:03:11.600> expandable

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
with these piston works is expandable

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.840 
with these piston works is expandable
because<00:03:12.530> you<00:03:12.769> can<00:03:12.890> only<00:03:12.980> push<00:03:13.220> 12<00:03:13.459> flux<00:03:13.700> with

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
because you can only push 12 flux with

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:20.140 
because you can only push 12 flux with
pistons<00:03:14.209> that's<00:03:15.170> true<00:03:15.500> and<00:03:17.260> this<00:03:18.260> piston<00:03:19.250> worm

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
pistons that's true and this piston worm

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.149 
pistons that's true and this piston worm
you<00:03:20.269> can<00:03:20.540> its<00:03:21.230> there's<00:03:21.620> really<00:03:21.799> no<00:03:21.980> limit

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:22.159 
you can its there's really no limit

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:24.160 
you can its there's really no limit
because<00:03:22.549> it<00:03:22.700> can<00:03:23.209> just<00:03:23.450> go<00:03:23.599> as<00:03:23.750> far<00:03:23.930> as<00:03:24.079> you

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
because it can just go as far as you

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.580 
because it can just go as far as you
want

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
want

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.610 
want
but<00:03:24.879> although<00:03:25.900> every<00:03:26.900> single<00:03:27.230> block<00:03:27.379> you<00:03:27.500> may

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
but although every single block you may

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.640 
but although every single block you may
be<00:03:27.680> wider<00:03:28.010> will<00:03:28.370> make<00:03:28.640> it<00:03:28.849> slower<00:03:29.260> so<00:03:30.260> keep

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
be wider will make it slower so keep

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.710 
be wider will make it slower so keep
that<00:03:30.769> in<00:03:30.829> mind<00:03:30.920> don't<00:03:31.489> make<00:03:31.730> it<00:03:31.849> to<00:03:32.090> one<00:03:32.360> if

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
that in mind don't make it to one if

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.080 
that in mind don't make it to one if
you're<00:03:32.900> gonna<00:03:33.049> make<00:03:33.290> this<00:03:33.610> you<00:03:34.610> know<00:03:34.670> there's

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
you're gonna make this you know there's

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.380 
you're gonna make this you know there's
gotta<00:03:35.239> be<00:03:35.299> -<00:03:35.569> anyways<00:03:36.019> I<00:03:36.819> don't<00:03:37.819> know<00:03:38.060> maybe

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
gotta be - anyways I don't know maybe

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.569 
gotta be - anyways I don't know maybe
it's<00:03:38.569> useful<00:03:38.870> for<00:03:38.900> map<00:03:39.109> makers<00:03:39.500> you<00:03:39.739> know<00:03:39.859> well

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
it's useful for map makers you know well

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.229 
it's useful for map makers you know well
it's<00:03:40.849> not<00:03:40.970> that<00:03:41.120> reliable<00:03:41.420> so<00:03:42.459> yeah<00:03:43.459> whatever

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
it's not that reliable so yeah whatever

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.589 
it's not that reliable so yeah whatever
I'm<00:03:44.859> gonna<00:03:45.859> make<00:03:45.980> slower<00:03:46.400> I<00:03:46.760> don't<00:03:47.299> know

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
I'm gonna make slower I don't know

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:51.250 
I'm gonna make slower I don't know
but<00:03:48.409> um<00:03:48.849> yeah<00:03:49.849> so<00:03:49.939> IP<00:03:50.450> you<00:03:50.599> guys<00:03:50.780> like<00:03:51.049> this

door concepts kind of thing there will

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.819 
door concepts kind of thing there will
be<00:03:55.400> a<00:03:55.519> rough<00:03:55.849> download<00:03:56.239> in<00:03:56.420> description<00:03:56.450> and<00:03:57.260> I

be a rough download in description and I

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:59.220 
be a rough download in description and I
guess<00:03:58.250> we'll<00:03:58.400> see<00:03:58.519> you<00:03:58.579> guys<00:03:58.639> next<00:03:58.849> time
