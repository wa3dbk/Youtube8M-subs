00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.500
 hello my people below I will show you 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.880
 some of the five planets where 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.880
 humanity could move 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:21.560
 1 kepler kepler 186 efe is a planet a 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.470
 little greater than the earth with surface 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.939
 oceanic and mountains if it became 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.550
 a new earth for humanity 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.700
 we would live there for years that would last 130 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.700
 days 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:40.530
 2 gliese thousand 667 cc is about another 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.900
 planet similar to the earth that also 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.809
 It has oceans and mountains in addition to 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.390
 years of 28 days the planet will cheer up 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.080
 the lovers of the heat since according to the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.129
 astronomers 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.570
 the temperature at 1667 cc is 40 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.700
 degrees 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.260
 3 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:02.870
 kepler kepler 62 efe another kepler that 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.100
 It is probably completely covered 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.900
 by water and has 267 days 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.580
 although the fact of life is apt for life 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.880
 that does not have land area 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:20.540
 could complicate the transfer 4 glee it 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.670
 See 832 CE It's probably also 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.470
 completely full of water although the 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.590
 temperature is identical to that of the 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:33.410
 earth 36 days of ours are equivalent 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:35.780
 a year in gliese 832 c5 captain b 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.700
 captain b scientists believe that this 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.560
 planet that is the closest to the 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.590
 earth and twice as big is 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.080
 completely covered by mountains one year 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.810
 in captain is equivalent to 48 days of 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.759
 our this planet is the 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.770
 first on the list among those who support 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.740
 the idea of â€‹â€‹moving to live another 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.660
 planet and those would be some of the 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.270
 planets where the 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.340
 humanity these five planets 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.450
 extrasolars present conditions of 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.600
 very similar life 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.850
 of the earth according to the scientists every 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.530
 one of these planets could become 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.200
 in a new homeland for humanity 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.629
 suggests trend magnet and without more to say 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.640
 my people see you in the next there 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:18.920
 I leave you other videos and I hope that you 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.220
 like until next time 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.270
 do not forget to comment that it costs nothing 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.550
 bye 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.550
 all right 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.550
 ah 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.050
 ah 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.530
 plus
