going to take each of the duels power

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.810 
going to take each of the duels power
into<00:01:09.420> consideration<00:01:10.080> as<00:01:10.200> well<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:11.130> need<00:01:11.490> to

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
into consideration as well you need to

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.280 
into consideration as well you need to
know<00:01:12.000> at<00:01:12.180> what<00:01:12.210> point<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.930> game<00:01:12.960> your

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
know at what point in the game your

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.560 
know at what point in the game your
champions<00:01:13.799> are<00:01:13.979> strongest<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:15.360> case

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
champions are strongest so in this case

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.719 
champions are strongest so in this case
we're<00:01:15.840> playing<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.350> no<00:01:16.409> virus<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.950> virus<00:01:17.580> dies

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
we're playing so no virus and virus dies

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.539 
we're playing so no virus and virus dies
a<00:01:17.790> level<00:01:18.210> four<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:18.960> what<00:01:19.170> exactly<00:01:19.350> can<00:01:20.159> we<00:01:20.220> do

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
a level four so what exactly can we do

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.730 
a level four so what exactly can we do
well<00:01:21.060> for<00:01:21.270> starters<00:01:21.390> Sona<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.140> pretty<00:01:22.409> beast<00:01:22.650> a

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
well for starters Sona is pretty beast a

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.859 
well for starters Sona is pretty beast a
level<00:01:23.009> 6<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.460> her<00:01:23.909> old<00:01:24.060> synergizes

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
level 6 and her old synergizes

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.899 
level 6 and her old synergizes
incredibly<00:01:25.530> well<00:01:25.740> with<00:01:25.770> virus<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.490> that's<00:01:26.759> a

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
incredibly well with virus so that's a

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.940 
incredibly well with virus so that's a
starting<00:01:27.240> point<00:01:27.450> reaching<00:01:28.229> level<00:01:28.470> six<00:01:28.710> and

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
starting point reaching level six and

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.130 
starting point reaching level six and
playing<00:01:29.220> safe<00:01:29.520> until<00:01:29.880> then<00:01:30.180> what<00:01:30.750> else<00:01:30.900> do<00:01:31.079> we

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
playing safe until then what else do we

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.749 
playing safe until then what else do we
need<00:01:31.350> as<00:01:31.799> son<00:01:32.130> I'm<00:01:32.250> going<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.640> need

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
need as son I'm going to need

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.670 
need as son I'm going to need
resistances<00:01:33.479> in<00:01:33.540> order<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.079> withstand<00:01:34.229> your

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
resistances in order to withstand your

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.289 
resistances in order to withstand your
damage<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.369> take<00:01:35.400> as<00:01:35.759> much<00:01:35.970> as<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.270> possibly

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
damage and take as much as I possibly

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.990
