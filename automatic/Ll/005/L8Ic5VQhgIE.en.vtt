this<00:02:03.540> deck<00:02:03.750> there's<00:02:03.960> probably<00:02:04.409> three<00:02:04.560> or<00:02:04.649> four

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
this deck there's probably three or four

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.100 
this deck there's probably three or four
slots<00:02:05.189> you<00:02:05.549> know<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.939> can<00:02:06.060> really<00:02:06.270> tweak

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
slots you know that you can really tweak

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.059 
slots you know that you can really tweak
and<00:02:08.209> this<00:02:09.209> was<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.450> raid<00:02:09.660> bombardment<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.890> was<00:02:11.009> a

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
and this was a raid bombardment it was a

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.590 
and this was a raid bombardment it was a
blasting<00:02:11.580> station

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
blasting station

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.930 
blasting station
it<00:02:13.200> was<00:02:13.470> an<00:02:13.740> inspired<00:02:14.220> charge<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:14.850> know

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
it was an inspired charge you know

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:15.860 
it was an inspired charge you know
there's<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.090> whole<00:02:15.210> bunch<00:02:15.330> of<00:02:15.450> characters<00:02:15.690> that

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
there's a whole bunch of characters that

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.050 
there's a whole bunch of characters that
are<00:02:15.990> good<00:02:16.110> in<00:02:16.140> this<00:02:16.320> archetype<00:02:17.100> so<00:02:17.310> I<00:02:17.520> thought

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
are good in this archetype so I thought

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.000 
are good in this archetype so I thought
I<00:02:18.090> even<00:02:18.810> had<00:02:18.960> storm<00:02:19.230> breath<00:02:19.410> dragon<00:02:19.800> in<00:02:19.890> there

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
I even had storm breath dragon in there

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.570 
I even had storm breath dragon in there
at<00:02:20.100> one<00:02:20.220> point<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:22.040> storm<00:02:23.040> earth<00:02:23.130> dragon<00:02:23.340> is

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
at one point and storm earth dragon is

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.180 
at one point and storm earth dragon is
for<00:02:23.820> damage<00:02:24.150> for<00:02:24.300> five<00:02:24.480> mana<00:02:24.750> so<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:25.740> bein<00:02:25.920> fire

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
for damage for five mana so is bein fire

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.600 
for damage for five mana so is bein fire
but<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:26.880> can<00:02:27.000> go<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.330> face<00:02:28.160> uncountable<00:02:29.160> at

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
but it can go to the face uncountable at

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.900 
but it can go to the face uncountable at
five<00:02:29.880> plus<00:02:30.180> it<00:02:31.020> can<00:02:31.200> remove<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.680> creature<00:02:31.920> you

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
five plus it can remove a creature you

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.250 
five plus it can remove a creature you
know<00:02:33.000> I<00:02:33.030> think<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:33.360> does<00:02:33.480> more<00:02:33.720> maybe<00:02:33.960> maybe

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
know I think it does more maybe maybe

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.020 
know I think it does more maybe maybe
the<00:02:34.440> trumpet<00:02:34.740> blast<00:02:34.950> or<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.400> inspired<00:02:35.730> charge

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
the trumpet blast or the inspired charge

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.570 
the trumpet blast or the inspired charge
is<00:02:36.210> better<00:02:36.710> maybe<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:37.860> raid<00:02:38.010> Bob<00:02:38.190> Berman<00:02:38.430> is

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
is better maybe the raid Bob Berman is

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.100 
is better maybe the raid Bob Berman is
better<00:02:38.790> I<00:02:38.880> don't<00:02:39.150> know<00:02:39.300> you<00:02:39.750> know<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:39.870> am

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
better I don't know you know I am

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.010 
better I don't know you know I am
playing<00:02:40.320> 23<00:02:40.800> land<00:02:41.040> in<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.280> stick<00:02:42.020> because

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
playing 23 land in the stick because

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.080 
playing 23 land in the stick because
it's<00:02:43.320> I<00:02:43.800> do<00:02:44.040> have<00:02:44.280> some<00:02:44.430> four<00:02:44.640> drops<00:02:44.880> that<00:02:45.000> I

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
it's I do have some four drops that I

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.400 
it's I do have some four drops that I
want<00:02:45.240> to<00:02:45.300> be<00:02:45.360> able<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.570> cast<00:02:45.750> I'm<00:02:46.140> playing

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
want to be able to cast I'm playing

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.910 
want to be able to cast I'm playing
phantom<00:02:46.770> general<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:48.440> over<00:02:49.440> battle<00:02:49.710> driver

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
phantom general and over battle driver

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.200 
phantom general and over battle driver
plus<00:02:50.250> we<00:02:50.400> have<00:02:50.490> the<00:02:50.520> true<00:02:50.670> flower<00:02:50.910> palette

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
plus we have the true flower palette

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.700 
plus we have the true flower palette
that<00:02:51.360> I<00:02:51.450> want<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.630> be<00:02:51.810> able<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:52.050> sink<00:02:52.230> mat<00:02:52.350> into

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
that I want to be able to sink mat into

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.710 
that I want to be able to sink mat into
so<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:53.280> think<00:02:53.370> in<00:02:53.580> a<00:02:53.640> 23<00:02:54.000> landecker<00:02:54.360> won't<00:02:54.570> copy

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
so I think in a 23 landecker won't copy

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.900 
so I think in a 23 landecker won't copy
of<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.990> fire<00:02:55.230> just<00:02:55.260> for<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.590> bit<00:02:55.650> of<00:02:55.770> reach<00:02:55.910> you

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
of a fire just for a bit of reach you

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.900 
of a fire just for a bit of reach you
know<00:02:57.030> it's<00:02:57.240> fine<00:02:57.510> if<00:02:57.930> things<00:02:58.410> go<00:02:58.590> wrong<00:02:58.910> could

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
know it's fine if things go wrong could

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:00.860 
know it's fine if things go wrong could
