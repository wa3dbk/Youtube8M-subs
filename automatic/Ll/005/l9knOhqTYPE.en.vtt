00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.590
 Elsewhere the state of the storm has listened properly in the Netherlands 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.130
 some problems walter and police have their hands full with storm damage 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.249
 in the southern Netherlands there are dozens of large lightning strikes 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:13.959
 track problems 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:17.530
 increasingly strong heavy showers over the country and there are those people us 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.550
 However, those animals cannot do any major damage 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.550
 At that time cars basements were flooded 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.359
 held the ceremony 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.210
 cancel at the same time 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.010
 that's why I like it 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.720
 next to each other 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.760
 yes the push of a button immediately so nothing from fellow countrymen 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.240
 yes word of god 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.110
 Yes Yes 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.110
 waalwijk what a whirlwind to see 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.350
 to smoke 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.639
 about the same number of points 

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:05.499
 as it is in many places especially in Brabant in the central and western Netherlands 

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:08.290
 decision seems 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.630
 as always 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.630
 8 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.610
 you will be 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.359
 and the heavy showers in other places in the country 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:24.390
 often accompanied by thunder and lightning strikes 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.810
 and a drilling platform in the North Sea on Tuesday 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.859
 there is no pay the piper this topic announced were immediately finally 

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:33.960
 come if we do that again 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.480
 with a short before any outside the storm starts right on time 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.890
 fortunately then once a week she also won again because of building land here too 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:42.720
 I get scared 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.020
 and at Schiphol it no longer seems like delay and nuisance 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.080
 although the passengers did not mind hundreds of planes 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.370
 barely apply 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.890
 I also dropped out about how programming will be at the end of October 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.149
 More and more wanted on RTL news
