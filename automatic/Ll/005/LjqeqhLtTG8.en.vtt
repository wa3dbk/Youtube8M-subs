while ago we haven't really had the time

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.570 
while ago we haven't really had the time

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
to for the video yet and that was pretty

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.519 
to for the video yet and that was pretty
much<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.910> good<00:00:18.180> paint<00:00:18.449> this<00:00:18.630> is<00:00:18.810> only<00:00:19.020> recently

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
much a good paint this is only recently

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.779 
much a good paint this is only recently
I<00:00:19.619> purchased<00:00:19.949> this<00:00:20.340> um<00:00:21.000> $20<00:00:22.400> Apple<00:00:23.400> studio

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
I purchased this um $20 Apple studio

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.870 
I purchased this um $20 Apple studio
display<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:25.080> has<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.230> matching<00:00:25.680> color<00:00:25.880> so

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
display that has a matching color so

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.299 
display that has a matching color so
I'll<00:00:26.970> go<00:00:27.119> ahead<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.599> boot<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.199> up<00:00:31.309> the

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
I'll go ahead and boot this up the

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.540 
I'll go ahead and boot this up the
marker<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.850> Trinitron<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.510> think<00:00:34.309> the<00:00:35.309> hard

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
marker is a Trinitron I think the hard

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.110 
marker is a Trinitron I think the hard
drive<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:36.000> pretty<00:00:36.270> loud<00:00:36.480> in<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:37.160> and<00:00:38.160> since

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
drive is pretty loud in this and since

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.650 
drive is pretty loud in this and since
it's<00:00:39.300> only<00:00:39.480> six<00:00:39.930> gigabytes<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:41.040> can<00:00:41.660> imagine

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
it's only six gigabytes you can imagine

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.770 
it's only six gigabytes you can imagine
it<00:00:42.989> would<00:00:43.050> be<00:00:43.110> quite<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.680> bit<00:00:43.890> old<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.780> that's

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
it would be quite a bit old and that's

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.040 
it would be quite a bit old and that's
probably<00:00:46.230> explains<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.750> noisiness<00:00:48.750> of

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
probably explains and the noisiness of

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.549 
probably explains and the noisiness of
it<00:00:49.230> now<00:00:50.180> you<00:00:51.180> didn't<00:00:51.480> hear<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.690> startup<00:00:52.230> chime

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
it now you didn't hear a startup chime

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.729 
it now you didn't hear a startup chime
that's<00:00:52.949> because<00:00:53.719> the<00:00:54.719> speaker's<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.379> bit

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
that's because the speaker's a bit

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.959 
that's because the speaker's a bit
faulty<00:00:56.280> if<00:00:57.230> everything<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.980> very<00:00:59.460> quiet

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.490 

okay<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.180> have<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.390> put<00:01:03.629> your<00:01:03.750> ear<00:01:03.930> right<00:01:03.960> up

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
okay you have to put your ear right up

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.000 
okay you have to put your ear right up
to<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.769> speaker<00:01:05.070> just<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.549> hear<00:01:06.200> so<00:01:07.200> here<00:01:07.920> we

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
to the speaker just to hear so here we

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.560 
to the speaker just to hear so here we
are<00:01:08.040> booting<00:01:08.549> into<00:01:08.700> Mac<00:01:09.630> OS<00:01:09.960> 10<00:01:09.990> ten<00:01:10.740> point<00:01:11.070> one

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
are booting into Mac OS 10 ten point one

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.990 
are booting into Mac OS 10 ten point one
reason<00:01:12.570> why<00:01:12.659> 10.1<00:01:13.470> not<00:01:13.710> ten<00:01:14.040> point<00:01:14.369> four<00:01:14.670> like

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
reason why 10.1 not ten point four like

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.090 
reason why 10.1 not ten point four like
in<00:01:15.150> most<00:01:15.360> videos<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:16.259> because<00:01:16.439> since<00:01:16.830> most

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
in most videos is because since most

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.289 
in most videos is because since most
videos<00:01:17.460> are<00:01:17.700> ten<00:01:17.909> point<00:01:18.150> four<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:19.490> I<00:01:20.490> think<00:01:21.119> it

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
videos are ten point four I I think it

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.530 
videos are ten point four I I think it
would<00:01:21.720> be<00:01:21.900> nice<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.700> have<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> change<00:01:24.119> for<00:01:24.509> a

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
would be nice to have a change for a

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.630 
would be nice to have a change for a
while<00:01:25.040> or<00:01:26.040> at<00:01:26.640> least<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:27.210> video

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.039 

now<00:01:31.640> currently<00:01:32.240> I've<00:01:32.450> got<00:01:32.659> this<00:01:32.840> at<00:01:33.020> a

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
now currently I've got this at a

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.149 
now currently I've got this at a
resolution<00:01:33.530> of<00:01:33.999> 1920<00:01:34.999> by<00:01:35.030> 1080<00:01:35.890> and<00:01:36.890> asked<00:01:37.039> the

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
resolution of 1920 by 1080 and asked the

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.249 
resolution of 1920 by 1080 and asked the
maximum<00:01:37.700> resolution<00:01:37.880> this<00:01:38.509> computer<00:01:39.079> will

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
maximum resolution this computer will

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.789 
maximum resolution this computer will
allow<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:40.670> monitor<00:01:41.179> to<00:01:41.420> go<00:01:41.539> up<00:01:41.689> too<00:01:41.899> and<00:01:42.530> I<00:01:42.679> was

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
allow the monitor to go up too and I was

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.649 
allow the monitor to go up too and I was
quite<00:01:42.950> amazed<00:01:43.250> to<00:01:43.579> see<00:01:43.609> that<00:01:43.819> it<00:01:44.060> would<00:01:44.270> go<00:01:44.479> up

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
quite amazed to see that it would go up

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.740 
quite amazed to see that it would go up
to<00:01:44.689> this<00:01:45.649> resolution<00:01:46.039> I<00:01:49.329> don't<00:01:50.329> really<00:01:50.599> enjoy

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
to this resolution I don't really enjoy

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.800 
to this resolution I don't really enjoy
it<00:01:51.140> on<00:01:51.259> this<00:01:51.439> resolution<00:01:52.270> so<00:01:53.270> I<00:01:53.299> must<00:01:53.689> have

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
it on this resolution so I must have

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:02.319 
it on this resolution so I must have
accidentally<00:01:54.380> left<00:01:54.619> it<00:01:54.799> on<00:01:58.359> so<00:02:00.399> I'll<00:02:01.399> just<00:02:02.149> set

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
accidentally left it on so I'll just set

know<00:02:30.769> if<00:02:30.890> it<00:02:31.010> always<00:02:31.310> did<00:02:31.700> I<00:02:32.150> think<00:02:32.209> this<00:02:32.450> might

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
know if it always did I think this might

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.199 
know if it always did I think this might
be<00:02:32.690> an<00:02:32.989> updated<00:02:33.880> install<00:02:34.880> with<00:02:35.030> some

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
be an updated install with some

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.199 
be an updated install with some
additions<00:02:35.980> anyway<00:02:36.980> so<00:02:37.040> that's<00:02:37.519> the<00:02:37.700> Power<00:02:38.000> Mac

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
additions anyway so that's the Power Mac
