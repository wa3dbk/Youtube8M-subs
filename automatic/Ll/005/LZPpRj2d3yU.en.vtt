00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.480
 Hi guys, I'm good here, what's next? 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.150
 commenting and today I'll talk about the 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.820
 level he recently had the ocean end 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.610
 the way of the game before any 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.259
 The thing I need is that it's very difficult. 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.750
 talk about this book as soon as I 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:34.300
 I finished reading I was thinking 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.480
 that I could talk about history and 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.550
 I got kind of lost I started 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:44.350
 talking about this book using a 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:47.019
 sun clichÃ© that just even going to know 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.300
 It's really what the story is about. 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:52.570
 I feel like I was going to take a review. 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:56.079
 very clear trying to really explain 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.789
 the story and talk in detail about 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.609
 the events 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:02.620
 he ends up dropping today's singles 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:05.110
 so I'm not going to do it, I do not 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.960
 I'll drop a choice our search. 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.120
 so I feel like this video will stay 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.940
 special mean that I can not do 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:16.870
 half of what the meaning is 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.850
 reading this book but I'll try 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.800
 I started reading this book without 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.830
 know nothing of what the story was about 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.440
 and when I saw the cover it the title by 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.280
 first time I had the impression of being 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.520
 a book that did not have a magical world 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.670
 included 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:37.600
 I thought it was a book with characters. 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.580
 involved in common situations but 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.890
 I could not be anything else 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.570
 the book tells the story of a boy 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.520
 without a boy because we do not know the 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.040
 His name when the story begins. 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:52.000
 He is already a middle-aged man but he 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.640
 We must return to the city where he spent 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.100
 childhood and the beginning of adolescence to 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.120
 the funeral and after that it was this 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.610
 funeral 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.310
 he gets in the car and heads toward the 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.030
 house where he sees it when he lived there 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.960
 in this city and he goes through this house 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.179
 where he lived 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.900
 but he keeps going down the street because 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:17.060
 at the end of that street is farm of 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.400
 risps plays the mysterious 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.650
 receives a stop and he arrives at this farm and 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.860
 goes toward a lake that is in 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:28.610
 background of the house the side that according to Alex 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:31.099
 Touch you and get there on that side. 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.550
 who is in the back of this house he feels 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.750
 a bench across the lake and he looking 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.989
 to that lake 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.750
 he starts to remember some things 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:44.450
 bizarre things that happened to him when 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.310
 he was a child and from then on when he 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.080
 begins to remember that we are going to 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:54.799
 ship with him these memories 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:56.330
 and meet some bizarre beings and using 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.470
 ancestral knowledge 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.410
 the book is narrated in the first person 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.319
 By the boy and he is seven years old. 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.370
 so despite being an adult book of the 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.010
 game 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.099
 it has an easy and smooth language 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.730
 the fact the book is narrated by a child 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:16.489
 narrative boot that touch of purity of 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.180
 innocence of someone who is discovering 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:22.340
 the world 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:25.190
 the boy who in history he is a reader 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.190
 voracious and often in history 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.530
 He talks about books in some moments. 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.230
 planet with fear how insecure 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.799
 When he's feeling alone, he 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.319
 take a book and read the books 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.880
 This company story for him and me. 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:44.000
 I think a lot of people will identify 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.190
 with that is difficult to talk about 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.370
 history of this book clearly because 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:53.209
 he is not a clear book he is the book 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:55.730
 half no idea but do not interpret and without 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.519
 notion as being a bad thing because it is not 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.459
 a book is crazy but very good 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:04.579
 Finding is beautiful, I did not have much 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.829
 notion of where it was all going to take me 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:09.139
 I could not understand what direction this 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:12.079
 story taking things are happening 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:12.799
 and you can not get a sense of why 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:15.650
 all 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:17.870
 After all, they are memories and they are 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.760
 memories of when he was a child 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.190
 then this lack of clarity in the 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.190
 perhaps this is why 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.040
 also when you are a child 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.060
 you have a very different view of the 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.730
 things, right? 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.510
 I really liked this book I gave 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:36.940
 four stars for them club and me 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.620
 I took his star because I wanted to 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.520
 that some things had been more 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:44.920
 would have been more exploited 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.530
 like I said earlier I understood 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.360
 this lack of clarity in the story but 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.800
 some things look so good that it is 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.680
 hard to believe 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.810
 It is difficult even to try to 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.640
 some facts that that did not go very well 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.220
 explained in the story but it is a great 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:03.970
 book made me tense at times 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:07.000
 I get apprehensive and afraid to turn 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.830
 pages because he was afraid he might 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.410
 happen to a boy and with arlete 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.530
 stop which made me sad too 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:17.700
 because the last pages are about to leave 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.030
 the heart and the book has an atmosphere 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.550
 delicious 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.350
 as much as I have been apprehensive 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.410
 at various times 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.820
 and it's nice to know how to keep up with that purity 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.580
 the childhood of someone who is 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.710
 discovering things and the friendship of the 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.540
 boy with alex is beautiful too 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.570
 I know I did not say much about 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.800
 story but believe me it's 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.800
 better that way 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.690
 The magic of this book is and discovering the 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.580
 things little by little 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.190
 Good people, that's it though 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.610
 felt that this video was a bit vague 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.440
 I hope you have stayed 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.810
 curious at least a little bit to 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.150
 know this story here and tell me 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:01.450
 in the comments if you have read more books 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:04.780
 and have a couple of reads talk to me at last 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:07.000
 there and guys other game videos 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:10.990
 I've seen some people commenting that 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.419
 most books in the game are like this 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:16.460
 there is this mixture in the magic world and the 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:19.430
 real world a mixture of realism 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.319
 did and I found it incredible according to 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.259
 game book that I read the first he 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:25.639
 was installed before and I want a lot of law 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:27.590
 in his other books 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:28.759
 anyway today is this I hope you have 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.919
 liked the video 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:35.169
 Thank you for having seen here a
