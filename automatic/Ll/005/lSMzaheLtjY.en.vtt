lot of times in church choirs right they
blend<00:00:31.800> them<00:00:32.040> which<00:00:32.460> would<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.759> prefer<00:00:32.910> a

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.150 
blend them which would you prefer a

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.530 
blend them which would you prefer a
sectional<00:00:33.809> choir<00:00:34.050> or<00:00:34.379> a<00:00:34.410> blended<00:00:34.920> choir<00:00:35.190> I

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
sectional choir or a blended choir I

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.700 
sectional choir or a blended choir I
prefer<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.720> have<00:00:36.870> people<00:00:37.140> blend<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.559> together

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
prefer to have people blend it together

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.640 
prefer to have people blend it together
and<00:00:38.010> have<00:00:38.160> them<00:00:38.280> blend<00:00:39.210> themselves<00:00:39.600> as<00:00:40.230> far<00:00:40.470> as

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:40.650 
and have them blend themselves as far as

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.910 
and have them blend themselves as far as
soprano<00:00:41.489> alto<00:00:41.730> tenor<00:00:41.879> bass<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:43.170> find<00:00:43.769> that<00:00:43.860> that

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
soprano alto tenor bass I find that that

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.700 
soprano alto tenor bass I find that that
achieves<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.760> better<00:00:44.940> sound<00:00:45.330> but<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.530> does

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
achieves a better sound but it does

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.100 
achieves a better sound but it does
require<00:00:46.979> that<00:00:47.400> you<00:00:47.580> work<00:00:47.970> closely<00:00:48.629> with<00:00:48.869> your

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
require that you work closely with your

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.200 
require that you work closely with your
choir<00:00:49.350> director<00:00:49.830> in<00:00:50.070> order<00:00:50.519> to<00:00:50.640> move<00:00:50.970> people

choir director in order to move people

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.270 
choir director in order to move people
around<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:52.229> that<00:00:52.260> they<00:00:52.470> sound<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.890> best<00:00:53.070> and

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
around so that they sound the best and

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.039 
around so that they sound the best and
achieve<00:00:53.549> the<00:00:53.729> best<00:00:53.909> sound<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.570> room<00:00:54.600> now

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:55.049 
achieve the best sound in the room now

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:56.600 
achieve the best sound in the room now
with<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.589> sixty<00:00:56.070> degree<00:00:56.309> cone<00:00:56.489> of

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
with that sixty degree cone of

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.399 
with that sixty degree cone of
sensitivity<00:00:57.150> you'd<00:00:57.239> find<00:00:57.479> in<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.659> cardioid<00:00:58.019> mic

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:58.409 
sensitivity you'd find in a cardioid mic

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:01.250 
sensitivity you'd find in a cardioid mic
I<00:00:58.739> would<00:00:59.610> imagine<00:00:59.850> that<00:01:00.089> the<00:01:00.420> louder<00:01:00.659> singers

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
I would imagine that the louder singers

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.840 
I would imagine that the louder singers
and<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.680> quieter<00:01:02.129> singers<00:01:02.489> it's<00:01:02.610> going<00:01:02.729> to<00:01:02.790> be

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
and the quieter singers it's going to be

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.160 
and the quieter singers it's going to be
vital<00:01:03.150> where<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.510> position<00:01:03.689> them<00:01:03.989> within

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
vital where you position them within

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.340 
vital where you position them within
that<00:01:04.619> radius<00:01:04.920> right<00:01:05.369> yeah<00:01:05.700> really<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.350> not

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
that radius right yeah really is a not

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.780 
that radius right yeah really is a not
typically<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.920> microphones<00:01:08.369> going<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.640> pick

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
typically the microphones going to pick

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.090 
typically the microphones going to pick
up<00:01:08.970> pretty<00:01:09.390> evenly<00:01:09.750> over<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.200> 60<00:01:10.650> degrees<00:01:10.950> if

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
up pretty evenly over that 60 degrees if

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.219 
up pretty evenly over that 60 degrees if
everybody's<00:01:11.520> equidistant<00:01:12.150> away<00:01:12.390> right<00:01:12.720> but

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
everybody's equidistant away right but

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.810 
everybody's equidistant away right but
if<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.439> put<00:01:13.740> people<00:01:13.890> near<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.310> edges<00:01:14.460> that

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
if you put people near the edges that

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.730 
if you put people near the edges that
are<00:01:14.940> maybe<00:01:15.060> louder<00:01:15.330> or<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:16.200> know<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.530> can

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
are maybe louder or you know you can

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.020 
are maybe louder or you know you can
kind<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:16.950> do<00:01:17.100> some<00:01:17.280> things<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.670> kind<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.910> move

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
kind of do some things to kind of move

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.090 
kind of do some things to kind of move
people<00:01:18.330> around<00:01:18.420> if<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.440> had<00:01:19.590> somebody<00:01:19.830> who's

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
people around if you had somebody who's

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.740 
people around if you had somebody who's
especially<00:01:20.700> loud<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:21.060> could<00:01:21.210> maybe<00:01:21.450> move

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
especially loud you could maybe move

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.240 
especially loud you could maybe move
that<00:01:21.960> person<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.410> the<00:01:22.500> edge<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.800> the<00:01:22.860> pattern<00:01:23.160> a

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
that person to the edge of the pattern a

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.340 
that person to the edge of the pattern a
little<00:01:23.400> bit<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.880> also<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.540> has<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.960> lot<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.140> do

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
little bit and also it has a lot to do

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.170 
little bit and also it has a lot to do
with<00:01:25.470> them<00:01:25.740> feeling<00:01:26.070> comfortable<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.940> sing

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
with them feeling comfortable to sing

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.899 
with them feeling comfortable to sing
out<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:28.350> know<00:01:28.440> what<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.950> their<00:01:29.130> hearing<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.550> I

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
out you know what to their hearing and I

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.670 
out you know what to their hearing and I
guess<00:01:30.090> if<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.360> were<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.570> have<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:31.110> choir<00:01:31.350> where

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
guess if you were to have a choir where

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.040 
guess if you were to have a choir where
your<00:01:31.830> miking<00:01:32.190> them<00:01:32.340> by<00:01:32.490> section<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.630> would<00:01:33.810> by

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
your miking them by section you would by

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.899 
your miking them by section you would by
definition<00:01:34.110> have<00:01:34.830> to<00:01:34.950> have<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.070> mic<00:01:35.310> for<00:01:35.520> each

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
definition have to have a mic for each

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.880 
definition have to have a mic for each
section<00:01:36.300> which<00:01:36.630> means<00:01:36.870> maybe<00:01:37.350> quite<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.680> few

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
section which means maybe quite a few

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.800 
section which means maybe quite a few
microphones<00:01:38.400> for<00:01:38.580> a<00:01:38.640> small<00:01:38.850> choir<00:01:39.120> yeah<00:01:39.630> it

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
microphones for a small choir yeah it

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.870 
microphones for a small choir yeah it
introduces<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.350> whole<00:01:40.560> lot<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.159> difficulties

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
introduces a whole lot of difficulties

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.690 
introduces a whole lot of difficulties
they<00:01:42.720> can<00:01:42.960> be<00:01:43.080> overcome<00:01:43.350> if<00:01:43.800> the<00:01:44.280> choir<00:01:44.580> is

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
they can be overcome if the choir is

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.100 
they can be overcome if the choir is
willing<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:44.909> work<00:01:45.060> with<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.420> but<00:01:45.870> I<00:01:45.900> mean

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
willing to work with you but I mean

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.899 
willing to work with you but I mean
obviously<00:01:46.440> they're<00:01:46.979> subject<00:01:47.400> to<00:01:47.430> how<00:01:47.580> you<00:01:47.640> mix

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
obviously they're subject to how you mix

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.570 
obviously they're subject to how you mix
them<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.690> sound<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.200> as<00:01:49.320> an<00:01:50.130> artist<00:01:50.310> I'd

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
them to the sound and as an artist I'd

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.030 
them to the sound and as an artist I'd
like<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.850> tend<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.330> hand<00:01:51.510> that<00:01:51.720> job<00:01:52.560> back<00:01:52.830> to

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
like to tend to hand that job back to

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.000 
like to tend to hand that job back to
them<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.570> try<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.870> get<00:01:55.530> them<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.740> blend

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
them so I try to get them to blend

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.980 
them so I try to get them to blend
themselves<00:01:56.330> if<00:01:57.330> you're<00:01:57.540> doing<00:01:57.720> like<00:01:57.960> a

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
themselves if you're doing like a

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.410 
themselves if you're doing like a
soprano<00:01:58.560> alto<00:01:58.950> tenor<00:01:59.070> bass<00:01:59.640> you<00:02:00.299> know

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
soprano alto tenor bass you know

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.690 
soprano alto tenor bass you know
optimally<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.320> have<00:02:01.440> four<00:02:01.680> microphones<00:02:02.250> but

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
optimally you have four microphones but

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.950 
optimally you have four microphones but
then<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:02.970> have<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.180> have<00:02:03.270> twenty<00:02:03.690> out<00:02:03.840> of

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
then you have to have twenty out of

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.960 
then you have to have twenty out of
those<00:02:04.110> twenty<00:02:04.590> ten<00:02:04.799> or<00:02:04.950> twenty<00:02:05.370> Sopranos<00:02:05.850> and

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
those twenty ten or twenty Sopranos and

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.070 
those twenty ten or twenty Sopranos and
twenty<00:02:06.210> vases<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.750> not<00:02:07.380> likely<00:02:07.590> probably<00:02:08.459> not

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
twenty vases and not likely probably not

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.449 
twenty vases and not likely probably not

range of your microphones physically

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.390 
range of your microphones physically
move<00:02:17.849> your<00:02:18.239> choir<00:02:18.480> around<00:02:18.930> on<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.439> tiers<00:02:19.739> to

so we've been talking about miking

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.449 
so we've been talking about miking
acquire<00:02:27.849> for<00:02:28.480> live<00:02:28.780> purposes<00:02:29.680> and<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.189> church

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:32.409 
or in the concert hall it's also

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:34.080 
or in the concert hall it's also
benefits<00:02:32.980> for<00:02:33.129> recording<00:02:33.579> your<00:02:33.609> choir<00:02:33.909> as

benefits for recording your choir as
well<00:02:34.329> can't<00:02:34.689> you<00:02:34.840> just<00:02:35.019> use<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.439> microphones

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
well can't you just use the microphones

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.679 
well can't you just use the microphones
that<00:02:35.950> we've<00:02:36.129> been<00:02:36.250> using<00:02:36.430> for<00:02:36.609> the<00:02:37.030> PA<00:02:37.209> for

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:37.689 
that we've been using for the PA for

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:39.690 
that we've been using for the PA for
recording<00:02:38.109> yeah<00:02:38.680> if<00:02:38.859> your<00:02:39.010> detailed<00:02:39.459> in<00:02:39.579> your

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
recording yeah if your detailed in your

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.069 
recording yeah if your detailed in your
setup<00:02:39.939> and<00:02:40.209> you<00:02:40.269> pay<00:02:40.420> attention<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.989> it

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
setup and you pay attention and it

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.990 
setup and you pay attention and it
sounds<00:02:41.439> really<00:02:41.680> good<00:02:41.859> in<00:02:42.129> the<00:02:42.430> room<00:02:42.609> most

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
sounds really good in the room most

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.979 
sounds really good in the room most
likely<00:02:43.299> it's<00:02:43.389> going<00:02:43.510> to<00:02:43.569> sound<00:02:43.689> pretty<00:02:43.870> good

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
likely it's going to sound pretty good

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.140 
likely it's going to sound pretty good
on<00:02:44.260> a<00:02:44.290> recording<00:02:44.950> you<00:02:45.129> can<00:02:45.250> just<00:02:45.400> take<00:02:45.609> a<00:02:45.639> bus

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
on a recording you can just take a bus

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.640 
on a recording you can just take a bus
out<00:02:46.389> of<00:02:46.510> your<00:02:46.629> console<00:02:47.049> and<00:02:47.230> hook<00:02:47.379> up<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:47.620> a

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
out of your console and hook up to a

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.949 
out of your console and hook up to a
two-track<00:02:47.920> recorder<00:02:48.459> and<00:02:48.609> press<00:02:49.480> record<00:02:49.840> and

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
two-track recorder and press record and

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.149 
two-track recorder and press record and
have<00:02:50.109> a<00:02:50.170> pretty<00:02:50.349> good<00:02:50.439> recording<00:02:50.829> you<00:02:50.950> could

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 
have a pretty good recording you could

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:52.890 
have a pretty good recording you could
there's<00:02:51.519> other<00:02:51.730> techniques<00:02:52.120> that<00:02:52.299> I<00:02:52.329> think

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
there's other techniques that I think

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.140 
there's other techniques that I think
would<00:02:53.049> probably<00:02:53.079> sound<00:02:53.650> better<00:02:53.939> if<00:02:54.939> you're

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
would probably sound better if you're

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.960 
would probably sound better if you're
trying<00:02:55.359> to<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:56.079> do<00:02:56.290> a<00:02:56.319> recording<00:02:56.919> so<00:02:57.459> like<00:02:57.669> say

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
trying to to do a recording so like say

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.610 
trying to to do a recording so like say
you're<00:02:58.120> doing<00:02:58.209> chamber<00:02:58.629> music<00:02:58.840> you<00:02:59.470> might

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
you're doing chamber music you might

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.899 
you're doing chamber music you might
want<00:02:59.829> to<00:02:59.859> put<00:03:00.040> mics<00:03:00.370> out<00:03:00.549> in<00:03:00.760> your<00:03:00.849> room

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:00.909 
want to put mics out in your room

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:02.670 
want to put mics out in your room
probably<00:03:01.569> use<00:03:01.840> a<00:03:01.870> different<00:03:02.200> kind<00:03:02.530> of

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
probably use a different kind of

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.080 
probably use a different kind of
microphone<00:03:03.099> with<00:03:03.519> a<00:03:03.549> different<00:03:03.909> polar

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
microphone with a different polar

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.599 
microphone with a different polar
pattern<00:03:04.510> maybe<00:03:04.750> so<00:03:05.319> you<00:03:05.379> get<00:03:05.709> to<00:03:06.010> pick<00:03:06.280> up<00:03:06.430> all

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
pattern maybe so you get to pick up all

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:08.520 
pattern maybe so you get to pick up all
the<00:03:06.909> reflections<00:03:07.239> and<00:03:07.689> ambient<00:03:08.139> sound<00:03:08.319> that

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
the reflections and ambient sound that

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.379 
the reflections and ambient sound that
your<00:03:08.650> room<00:03:08.829> has<00:03:09.040> to<00:03:09.219> offer<00:03:09.310> you<00:03:10.120> would<00:03:10.269> not

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:10.389 
your room has to offer you would not

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:12.089 
your room has to offer you would not
want<00:03:10.569> to<00:03:10.719> do<00:03:10.810> that<00:03:10.959> technique<00:03:11.379> for<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.950> PA

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
want to do that technique for the PA

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:13.949 
want to do that technique for the PA
system<00:03:12.250> yet<00:03:12.790> right<00:03:13.000> that's<00:03:13.359> true<00:03:13.629> what<00:03:13.810> we're

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
system yet right that's true what we're

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.599 
system yet right that's true what we're
talking<00:03:14.349> about<00:03:14.439> here<00:03:14.919> with<00:03:15.159> our<00:03:15.310> miking
