 new adventure begins for you yes 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.969
 I think it's an honor to 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:38.370
 to arrive at such a prestigious club 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:41.850
 to start work with my 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.690
 Deputy Patrick boonen who comes 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.690
 with me 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.930
 so here we hope a great challenge 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.430
 in perspective and full of ambitions 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.739
 as always it's a new 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.230
 adventure that starts yes yes well it's 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.629
 the adventure I was looking for something 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.699
 so share it when we present it 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.129
 so that's something I 'm going 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.170
 take very seriously 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.520
 it's a very exciting challenge then 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.409
 precisely she was you at the head of 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.880
 the Ivorian selection with whom they 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.310
 examine at the african cup 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.659
 why leave everything finally accepted 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.430
 this proposal of losc in eight years 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.470
 I feel like I did a lot 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.130
 more than I could and he 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.000
 was hoping to win two cups 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.150
 Africa in three years 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.560
 made me think and get asked 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.020
 this question is what I can do 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.300
 better on this continent and I think that 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.350
 the answer is quickly found ie 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.070
 that it was not possible to do 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.790
 much better 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.390
 so I preferred to turn to a 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.920
 new challenge and 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.460
 a new challenge it was a club 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.780
 ambitious with infrastructure to the 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.270
 height of his ambitions 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.830
 and when the losc contacted me and I 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.040
 found that it was something very 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.200
 interesting and exciting so that's it 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.220
 it does not refuse like the losc 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.930
 no no it's really the club that has 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.850
 returned as part of what I 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.030
 I was fixed I would not have left for 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.000
 any other club but I think 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.420
 that this one can bring us can 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.900
 bring with patrice great things 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.780
 we have already experienced some beautiful emotions 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.930
 fantastic now we want to live 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.160
 many others but in europe 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.140
 so what exactly were the words 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.590
 President Michel Seydoux for you 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.180
 to convince 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:37.910
 he had to persuade him there was already 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.610
 a very interesting feeling now 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.800
 I need that feeling endures I think 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.230
 after our interview there are some 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.579
 days he was convinced it's a 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.440
 turning a turn for the losc and then 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.760
 me it's a challenge that suits me very well 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.430
 alright so let's go 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.980
 all together we also imagine that you 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.510
 have already discussed the contours of 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.640
 the Lille squad there the season 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.560
 next with players who are already 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.940
 there and maybe some arrivals you 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.519
 will come with players in your 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.760
 baggage no I 'm going to already proposed them 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:13.519
 then we will decide in a common way 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.489
 because a project in football it is 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.510
 not led by one person 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.769
 so here we have to do things 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.110
 intelligently 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.239
 the priority is already to take 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.430
 boys who have a lot of quality who 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.220
 can bring more to the team 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.340
 and then possibly compensate for 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.140
 departures since there will inevitably 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.940
 the goals you have to have the most 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.860
 high up now define them in 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.850
 terms of position I think it is 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.910
 too early to do it 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.320
 I was lucky and in selection of 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.820
 zambia in ivory coast selection 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.250
 to have very talented players 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.260
 technically able to play 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.480
 able 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.950
 to have possession of the balloon so 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.489
 here I think there are already boys 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.409
 who have an important technical background 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.670
 in this team so he's going to have to him 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:59.439
 make a few small touches 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.900
 technique to have a team that is 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:03.519
 able to master the game well and 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.099
 to be effective this is the most important 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.510
 what do you say to the fans 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:09.129
 Lille who can not wait 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.980
 we imagine starting a new 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:13.930
 adventure with you at the head of the losc who 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.919
 retain the positive this season the 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.919
 second part that they have a 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.930
 positive attitude that support us 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:26.320
 we need a lot of people in the 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.180
 stage to do the show that 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.380
 ask then the show is not 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.800
 always possible but you have to do it 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.539
 as often as possible especially in a 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:38.380
 stadium as beautiful and that everything is 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:39.729
 party on very positive bases you 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.710
 are eager to start this 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:43.180
 new adventure and of course at each 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.250
 once we start a new challenge 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.520
 urna we have plenty of ideas we have plenty of 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.289
 dreams 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.910
 we have a few weeks to really get 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:50.880
 prepare already before the players 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:54.660
 arrive and then when they will arrive 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.660
 a lot of work to provide
