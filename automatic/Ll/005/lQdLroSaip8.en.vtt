the physical step on his card does make

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.320 
the physical step on his card does make
up<00:04:33.560> for<00:04:33.800> it<00:04:33.860> and<00:04:34.070> yet<00:04:34.400> it<00:04:34.730> looks<00:04:34.760> like<00:04:35.210> an

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
up for it and yet it looks like an

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.940 
up for it and yet it looks like an
absolutely<00:04:35.720> cracking<00:04:36.020> team<00:04:36.440> and<00:04:36.680> i'll<00:04:36.740> tell

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
you if it is in highlights right so this

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.740

and<00:05:43.760> M<00:05:44.390> awareness<00:05:45.350> around<00:05:45.500> him<00:05:45.890> of<00:05:46.040> when<00:05:46.190> you

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
and M awareness around him of when you

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.970

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:04.340 
around about 30 to 50 in tool the entire

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.430 
around about 30 to 50 in tool the entire
squad<00:06:04.670> builder<00:06:04.970> but<00:06:05.390> yeah<00:06:05.480> fullbacks<00:06:06.170> work

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
squad builder but yeah fullbacks work

pretty<00:06:06.710> well<00:06:06.800> i<00:06:07.040> mean<00:06:07.220> beans<00:06:07.790> wasn't<00:06:08.420> the<00:06:08.600> best

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
pretty well i mean beans wasn't the best

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.110 
pretty well i mean beans wasn't the best
i<00:06:09.080> would<00:06:09.200> say<00:06:09.350> Luke<00:06:09.590> Shaw<00:06:09.950> is<00:06:10.250> basically

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
i would say Luke Shaw is basically

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.520 
i would say Luke Shaw is basically
slightly<00:06:11.750> better<00:06:11.930> because<00:06:12.170> he's<00:06:12.320> got<00:06:12.500> a

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:12.530 
slightly better because he's got a

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.320 
slightly better because he's got a
little<00:06:12.770> bit<00:06:13.010> more<00:06:13.160> piece<00:06:13.430> beans<00:06:13.970> has<00:06:14.150> got

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
little bit more piece beans has got

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.660 
little bit more piece beans has got
lethal<00:06:14.750> free<00:06:14.960> kicks<00:06:15.260> though<00:06:15.500> I<00:06:15.710> didn't<00:06:16.430> manage

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:16.670 
lethal free kicks though I didn't manage

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.250 
lethal free kicks though I didn't manage
to<00:06:16.700> score<00:06:17.000> any<00:06:17.150> but<00:06:17.450> the<00:06:17.600> keeper<00:06:17.750> did<00:06:17.990> save<00:06:18.230> a

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.260 
to score any but the keeper did save a

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.080 
to score any but the keeper did save a
couple<00:06:18.470> Simmons<00:06:18.890> Tevez<00:06:19.190> does<00:06:19.430> though<00:06:19.610> so<00:06:20.000> if

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.090 
couple Simmons Tevez does though so if

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.170 
couple Simmons Tevez does though so if
you<00:06:20.180> do<00:06:20.360> want<00:06:20.570> to<00:06:20.930> use<00:06:21.020> someone<00:06:21.380> pc<00:06:21.620> and<00:06:22.180> then

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.180 
you do want to use someone pc and then

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.630 
you do want to use someone pc and then
by<00:06:24.020> all<00:06:24.050> means<00:06:24.200> do<00:06:24.590> i<00:06:24.620> think<00:06:24.980> if<00:06:25.100> you<00:06:25.220> use<00:06:25.370> sure

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:25.640
