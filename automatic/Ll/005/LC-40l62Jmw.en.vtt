00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.600
 camara has no words 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.600
 too much of the time on this terrible danger 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.039
 Machado retained with the selection of Portugal 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.849
 to the balloon in the penalty area 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:27.419
 following the contest paulo machado both on the activity not 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.289
 Portuguese had to hit hard 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.560
 the purchase of objects at the castle 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.230
 impeccable 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.230
 it's just a match 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.900
 little by little certainly there are many believers to wash 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.900
 deschamps the port of the official delegation here in toulouse 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.470
 the yard is nothing but a wheel will soon explore 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.300
 why ballooning 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.620
 factory from dvd 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.500
 but if we read 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.000
 shooting photos for defensive tasks 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.700
 the first picks 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.330
 two babies 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.050
 in the surface 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.050
 with his title 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.150
 and then you still need him who was generous 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.220
 look, we'll see him 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.630
 there are sick 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.050
 I wish with all my heart to see muscular guys cameron estimated 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.190
 I am disappointed by his ability to react in sub-card 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.190
 I do not think the most critical 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.540
 in this file 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.270
 but the prices in front of the goal 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.270
 that's why he continues 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:13.639
 a form of defensive passivity 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:17.139
 everything must be physically ready block the formats of abidjan 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:18.969
 it's a pole 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:21.969
 but anyway 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.709
 twenty minutes after 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.649
 under the eyes of leonardo 

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:39.649
 tertiary crossroads of course 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:42.099
 if the market is exhausted 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.099
 what struck me at africamer 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.579
 price of seats is very well played 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.780
 the tray and the balloon to guarantee the interest of trucks with 8 go 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.799
 give answers 

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:44.029
 and all under the eyes of carlier guy in action at the very top 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.999
 welcome 

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:54.030
 he will leave when paris will have found his forward response 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.659
 12 48 or 72 

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:04.499
 I go out with my feet 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.799
 film 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.729
 the couple was absolutely not 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:11.729
 however many lots of solution to give the ball 

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:15.589
 introduced by tour which intervenes 

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:32.090
 faustine sappa anti-corrida patrol 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.090
 and immediately we are in the depths 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:41.749
 a powerful head shot 

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:44.749
 that passes over he can not establish 

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:50.020
 it's not complicated between the smuggler is good 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.050
 the centrists are perfectly striking 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.050
 the goal scorer 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.650
 we can find survivors 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.919
 the markings also of the Argentine 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.919
 would they have all the bullfighting shows 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.639
 two of the four tracks in the department 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:25.550
 christian prudhomme 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.330
 the pole of the armada 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.610
 crisis 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.500
 the application luc beraud but it's rare that I went once again 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.370
 more 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:35.669
 turn after turn 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.680
 the most sublime 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.680
 for Parisians a few minutes from the end 

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:49.979
 the two singers 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:53.880
 factory 30 meters against the goal why not miss with the mother to look 

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:56.879
 the fray 

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:24.189
 it seems unlikely 

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:30.559
 hamada but some turns 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:40.449
 if we hear the Parisian fans 

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:44.639
 under the stadium sun 

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:47.639
 once a day and per person 

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:16.759
 alas the choice of antoine 

00:07:31.309 --> 00:07:31.999
 and worse than anything
