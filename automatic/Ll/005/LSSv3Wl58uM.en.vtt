00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.589
 to talk almost nothing to you 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.319
 I came back here again to talk about 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.200
 male fashion and ethics instead is about the 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.330
 famous pants torn by a post 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.940
 on our site and has already passed some 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.719
 instructions for you but before 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.439
 inspiration 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.270
 you there our final religion in the 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.939
 time to record pass through new networks 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.460
 is fashion censorship clothing for 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.609
 twitter made grand-am and facebook.com 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.949
 I want to censor you on facebook 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.620
 staff, I also want to thank the 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.510
 interactions the corresponding messages 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.149
 everyone there proving that the questions 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.050
 which are very repeated like this 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.050
 video here 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.750
 and I spoke in video form obviously 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.629
 by the company responding with an eye and 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.760
 sertÃ£o the crib is repetitive understood 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.010
 So how's this fund in a massive way? 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.289
 a car like you can see how the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.170
 actors eric bana of the child they have 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.079
 appeared there with other fashion icons 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.910
 male with the pants torn in height 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.820
 of the knee with only a shallow 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.210
 This is super high. You 're chubby. 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.070
 marketing can invest in this type of 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.010
 cut in the pants 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.340
 many companies have already applied this cause 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.049
 with tear already coming from the store at the time 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.330
 knee but you can do with a 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.939
 old pants and give another one the guard 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.520
 black panties clothes that you do not wear 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.829
 because it thinks it is out of fashion or 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.960
 because she is failing another 30 gives a 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.950
 purpose and knee ratio and will stay 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.930
 jewelry 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.540
 the combinations for this type of error 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.520
 just this kind of play forever 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.229
 pillar more casual and more basic 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.840
 fashion to understand though you 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.350
 can match and was frontal tshirts 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.689
 with shirts or make the combination there 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.000
 has been repeated by several and leather 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.220
 style too because it's what the 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.280
 which front print with the shirt 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.350
 tied around the waist and wearing a 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.649
 heavier footwear 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.899
 so today's tip is this is very fast 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.310
 and came back here the next as a tip 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.680
 in 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.680
 we use the next one up more
