snow what are its causes snoring happens
when<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:23.760> have<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:23.939> narrow<00:00:24.269> array<00:00:24.840> inside<00:00:25.350> your

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
throat the narrowing ebba can be caused

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.890 
throat the narrowing ebba can be caused
by<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.349> fatty<00:00:28.710> tissue<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.939> relaxation<00:00:30.720> of

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
by a fatty tissue and the relaxation of

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.549 
sleeping the heavy inside your throat
will<00:00:35.520> become<00:00:35.820> narrower<00:00:36.270> causing<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.170> air<00:00:37.350> to

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
will become narrower causing the air to

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.700 
will become narrower causing the air to
move<00:00:37.710> faster<00:00:38.340> men<00:00:38.960> when<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.140> happens<00:00:40.620> the
