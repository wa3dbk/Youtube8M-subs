00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.390
 east the advance and master finally 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.130
 arrived and with that comes that question 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.410
 that everyone was already expecting 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:34.510
 it's worth investing in his purchase 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:37.120
 even for those who already have an original 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.670
 end this doubt the bj put the 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.210
 games side by side and tested the look 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:48.760
 the details of the results 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:50.769
 You now confess to provoking and already 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.199
 we warn you that the difference we find 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:55.780
 it's much bigger than it looks 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.939
 even for a remaster 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.790
 textures are the biggest highlight of the 

00:00:57.939 --> 00:01:02.680
 last of master all scenarios and 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.280
 characters received an improvement 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:11.650
 sensitive in quality visual 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:13.570
 quadrupled in addition to the improvement in 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.880
 current dispute whether in the resolution of the 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.549
 last of master allows all this 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.200
 beauty is visible even in objects 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.200
 further away 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.880
 you will definitely notice this for 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.880
 wherever you look during the adventure 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.509
 as noticeable as textures 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.700
 improved is the frame rate that jumped 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.920
 to 60 fps 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.229
 this increase has meant that transitions and 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.430
 camera changes would be much more 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.330
 soft 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.600
 already the controversial 30 fps mode is 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.310
 leave the shadows with more definition 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.619
 works but the result is not good 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.330
 enough to give up the fluidity of 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.000
 60 fps 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.950
 another novelty is the increased resolution 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.899
 with level 80 p 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.299
 we have much sharper images in 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.670
 cleaner scenarios allowing the 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:10.420
 game visuals and textures have 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:13.360
 impressive details and if people 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.790
 Pass you have love of life, give half 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.360
 back and back we do not want anything with 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.580
 you 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.290
 we want robert the new generation does not 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.989
 has been called the generation of 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.299
 particles acts among them new masters 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.489
 this is especially visible in 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:29.349
 areas with game spores that have 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.930
 more natural effects 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:34.570
 side by side with the version of ps3 to 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.700
 difference is even greater since in the 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.680
 four the number of particles allows 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.790
 much more realistic effects in 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.790
 previous generation with 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.100
 the original voice sprinter already had a 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.140
 virtually flawless lighting but in 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.060
 remastered version we have a job 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.000
 of even better shadows 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.700
 Enough from that layered shade now 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.600
 We have much milder effects and how 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.600
 top setting 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.750
 already inside houses buildings and others 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.970
 closed environments velÃ©z master people 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.860
 some slips with some 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.420
 objects that do not appear to have received 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.840
 many touches 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.060
 fortunately these are exceptions in most 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.550
 of cases the textures work gives 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:34.470
 account leaving these locations 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:36.360
 much more beautiful than in the original 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.880
 many may not realize the 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.270
 difference that the last of matter brought 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.950
 for outdoors now plants 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.440
 and animals are not only much more 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.470
 detailed as well as appear in greater detail 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.480
 amount in the scenario proof of this is 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.870
 our first contact with the environment 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.760
 during the day you will notice that 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.019
 there are many more leaves the making 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:03.510
 walls, for example, puddles of water 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.730
 I think c other environments change a little 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.850
 but it is possible to perceive a work of 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.410
 lighting that did not exist in the original 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:16.290
 leaving liquids with a good look 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:18.019
 more realistic in this advance already counted 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.820
 with characters absurdly 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.460
 detailed but now you can see 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.040
 everything so sharp you can tell 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.990
 Indian beards and freckles in the 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.150
 l face do here 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.470
 already for the other characters it seems that 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.840
 the change was smaller 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.840
 although the textures definitely 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.850
 help enemy accomplices have 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.100
 an aesthetic treatment a little less 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:44.280
 detailed than expected 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.770
 one of the biggest advantages of ps4 and its 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.260
 resolution was the improvement in 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.200
 serrated and textures in the game 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.690
 here the blurred textures gave way to 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.760
 images in high definition as well as 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.650
 absence of serrated leaves and 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.020
 leaves with an impressive look 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.479
 last of matter can improve on 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.470
 almost every aspect compared to the 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:08.259
 original 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.060
 so anyone who has never lived this adventure 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:13.389
 need to think before giving a 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:16.030
 chance for remastering yet 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:18.070
 we must admit that the difference is not 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.900
 to the point of being worth the 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.340
 investment for those who already have the 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.020
 of ps3 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.330
 because the game is just a 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.449
 remastering and not a 'remake' 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.400
 itself 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:33.479
