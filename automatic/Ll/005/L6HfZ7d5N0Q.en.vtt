00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
do that it does hold your hand it does

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.240 
do that it does hold your hand it does
tell<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.840> what<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.110> do<00:01:31.229> but<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.530> doesn't<00:01:31.710> limit

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
tell you what to do but it doesn't limit

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.730 
tell you what to do but it doesn't limit
to<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.549> whatever<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.509> want<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.810> do<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.320> go<00:01:34.530> do

to you whatever you want to do you go do

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.620 
to you whatever you want to do you go do
that<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.159> tutorial<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.759> very<00:01:35.970> broad<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.299> open

I<00:01:36.810> guess<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.110> could<00:01:37.259> say<00:01:37.380> at<00:01:37.560> least<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.860> start

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
I guess you could say at least the start

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.859 
I guess you could say at least the start
of<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.369> game<00:01:38.549> luckily<00:01:39.150> they<00:01:39.329> also<00:01:39.450> supply<00:01:39.750> you

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
of the game luckily they also supply you

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.960 
of the game luckily they also supply you

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
with an ample amount of gold so that you

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.460 
with an ample amount of gold so that you
can<00:01:42.150> actually<00:01:42.299> just<00:01:42.479> build<00:01:42.780> up<00:01:42.960> your<00:01:42.990> bases

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
can actually just build up your bases

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.410 
can actually just build up your bases
and<00:01:43.590> complete<00:01:43.829> these<00:01:43.920> quests<00:01:44.220> extremely<00:01:45.180> fast

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
and complete these quests extremely fast

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.120 
and complete these quests extremely fast
you<00:01:45.630> have<00:01:45.720> an<00:01:45.840> expectation<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.710> game<00:01:46.890> is

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
you have an expectation of the game is

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.100 
you have an expectation of the game is
really<00:01:47.640> unheard<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.420> genre<00:01:48.720> which<00:01:48.990> is

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
really unheard of in this genre which is

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.620 
really unheard of in this genre which is
really<00:01:49.320> all<00:01:49.500> about<00:01:49.530> waiting<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:51.000> what<00:01:51.329> are<00:01:51.360> we

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
really all about waiting so what are we

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.359 
really all about waiting so what are we
doing<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:52.049> this<00:01:52.229> game<00:01:52.590> well<00:01:52.860> for<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.159> most

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
doing in this game well for the most

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.679 
doing in this game well for the most
part<00:01:53.640> it's<00:01:54.000> really<00:01:54.270> you're<00:01:54.420> just<00:01:54.450> kind<00:01:54.659> of

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
part it's really you're just kind of

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.959 
part it's really you're just kind of
flipping<00:01:54.990> through<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.560> different<00:01:56.159> menus<00:01:56.640> and

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
flipping through the different menus and

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.520 
flipping through the different menus and
it's<00:01:57.149> basically<00:01:57.360> what<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.200> click<00:01:58.380> on

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
it's basically what it is you click on

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.010 
it's basically what it is you click on
the<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:59.100> stimuli<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.509> just<00:02:00.630> kind<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:00.899> the

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
the I stimuli and you just kind of the

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.270 
the I stimuli and you just kind of the
game<00:02:01.140> almost<00:02:01.320> plays<00:02:01.560> itself<00:02:01.860> at<00:02:02.009> least<00:02:02.159> at

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
game almost plays itself at least at

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.889 
game almost plays itself at least at
first<00:02:02.340> but<00:02:03.030> like<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.299> said<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.570> game<00:02:03.689> does

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
first but like I said the game does

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.389 
first but like I said the game does
absolutely<00:02:04.229> open<00:02:04.710> up<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.100> kind<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.280> have

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
absolutely open up and you kind of have

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.709 
absolutely open up and you kind of have
a<00:02:05.430> choice<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.850> what<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.090> want<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.299> specialize

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
a choice of what you want to specialize

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.300 
a choice of what you want to specialize
in<00:02:06.750> already<00:02:07.439> at<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.619> very<00:02:07.799> start<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.160> game

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
in already at the very start of the game

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.460 
in already at the very start of the game
but<00:02:08.849> for<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.209> most<00:02:09.390> part<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.780> game<00:02:09.989> really

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
but for the most part of the game really

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.720 
but for the most part of the game really
allows<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.250> kind<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.459> build<00:02:11.580> up

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
allows you to kind of build up

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.220 
allows you to kind of build up
everything<00:02:12.150> all<00:02:12.270> at<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.390> same<00:02:12.540> time<00:02:12.720> because

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
everything all at the same time because

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.199 
everything all at the same time because
quest<00:02:13.470> system<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:14.099> tells<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.730> build<00:02:14.909> for

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
quest system it tells you to build for

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.790 
quest system it tells you to build for
mines<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:15.870> maybe<00:02:16.019> you<00:02:16.230> don't<00:02:16.349> want<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.739> do

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
mines and maybe you don't want to do

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.289 
mines and maybe you don't want to do
that<00:02:16.830> but<00:02:17.159> just<00:02:17.400> do<00:02:17.519> it<00:02:17.640> anyways<00:02:17.940> because<00:02:18.090> you

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
that but just do it anyways because you

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:19.910 
that but just do it anyways because you
get<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.450> huge<00:02:18.780> amount<00:02:18.989> of<00:02:19.019> reward<00:02:19.379> so<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:19.709> might

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
get a huge amount of reward so you might

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.039 
get a huge amount of reward so you might
as<00:02:20.069> well<00:02:20.220> not<00:02:20.430> this<00:02:20.790> can<00:02:21.180> be<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.390> problem<00:02:21.659> at<00:02:21.930> the

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
as well not this can be a problem at the

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.380 
as well not this can be a problem at the
same<00:02:22.200> time<00:02:22.349> it<00:02:22.650> does<00:02:22.950> well<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.519> casual<00:02:24.090> eise's

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
same time it does well it casual eise's

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.820 
same time it does well it casual eise's
the<00:02:24.480> experience<00:02:25.049> but<00:02:25.379> that's<00:02:25.530> actually

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
the experience but that's actually

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.199 
the experience but that's actually
really<00:02:26.040> good<00:02:26.280> at<00:02:26.340> least<00:02:26.610> for<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.819> start<00:02:27.090> now

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
really good at least for the start now

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.940 
really good at least for the start now
endgame<00:02:27.750> of<00:02:27.780> course<00:02:28.140> once<00:02:28.349> you<00:02:28.470> actually<00:02:28.680> get

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
endgame of course once you actually get

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.410 
endgame of course once you actually get
up<00:02:29.099> to<00:02:29.190> end<00:02:29.370> game<00:02:29.519> then<00:02:30.000> there's<00:02:30.209> probably

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
up to end game then there's probably

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.910 
up to end game then there's probably
going<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.599> be<00:02:30.660> some<00:02:30.840> specialization<00:02:31.650> or<00:02:31.769> some

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
going to be some specialization or some

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.470 
going to be some specialization or some
niche<00:02:32.160> of<00:02:32.340> build<00:02:32.700> mechanics<00:02:33.150> that<00:02:33.209> you<00:02:33.330> can

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
niche of build mechanics that you can

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.210 
niche of build mechanics that you can
utilize<00:02:33.629> that<00:02:34.170> I<00:02:34.349> don't<00:02:34.680> know<00:02:34.799> this<00:02:35.040> is<00:02:35.190> a

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
utilize that I don't know this is a

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.949 
utilize that I don't know this is a
first<00:02:35.430> impression<00:02:35.640> but<00:02:36.239> for<00:02:36.599> the<00:02:36.750> most<00:02:36.870> part

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
first impression but for the most part

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.930 
first impression but for the most part
I'm<00:02:37.290> glad<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:37.739> the<00:02:37.830> game<00:02:37.980> is<00:02:38.129> casual<00:02:38.610> eyes<00:02:38.730> at

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
I'm glad that the game is casual eyes at

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:39.860 
I'm glad that the game is casual eyes at
least<00:02:39.090> at<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.239> beginning<00:02:39.329> because<00:02:39.569> this

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
least at the beginning because this

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.240 
least at the beginning because this
genre<00:02:40.200> is<00:02:40.319> riddled<00:02:40.620> with<00:02:40.680> games<00:02:40.950> that<00:02:41.099> takes

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
genre is riddled with games that takes

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.920 
genre is riddled with games that takes
so<00:02:41.549> long<00:02:41.819> to<00:02:41.879> actually<00:02:42.150> get<00:02:42.480> into<00:02:42.599> some<00:02:42.900> of

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
so long to actually get into some of

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.930 
so long to actually get into some of
these<00:02:43.049> MMR<00:02:43.440> tss<00:02:43.799> I<00:02:43.890> I<00:02:43.950> can't<00:02:44.459> even<00:02:44.579> get<00:02:44.819> into

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
these MMR tss I I can't even get into

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.460 
these MMR tss I I can't even get into
the<00:02:45.030> PvP<00:02:45.480> for<00:02:45.720> hours<00:02:46.019> and<00:02:46.110> hours<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.349> hours

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
the PvP for hours and hours and hours

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.869

and<00:02:46.739> I<00:02:46.769> like<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.129> battle<00:02:47.400> for<00:02:47.519> domination

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
and I like that battle for domination

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.819 
and I like that battle for domination
actually<00:02:48.540> allowed<00:02:48.810> me<00:02:48.989> to<00:02:49.110> use<00:02:49.140> my<00:02:49.319> military

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
actually allowed me to use my military

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.160 
actually allowed me to use my military
as<00:02:50.220> soon<00:02:50.579> as<00:02:50.849> I<00:02:51.150> basically<00:02:51.750> as<00:02:51.870> soon<00:02:51.900> as<00:02:52.079> the

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
as soon as I basically as soon as the

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660

is<00:03:36.690> actually<00:03:37.049> really<00:03:37.200> addictive<00:03:37.709> and<00:03:37.919> I<00:03:38.130> did

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
is actually really addictive and I did

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.770 
is actually really addictive and I did
not<00:03:38.579> have<00:03:38.760> to<00:03:38.880> play<00:03:39.060> this<00:03:39.180> game<00:03:39.329> for<00:03:39.389> a<00:03:39.599> few

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
not have to play this game for a few

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.390 
not have to play this game for a few
hours<00:03:39.810> but<00:03:40.260> I<00:03:40.319> kind<00:03:40.680> of<00:03:40.769> just<00:03:40.919> ended<00:03:41.280> up

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
hours but I kind of just ended up

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.190 
hours but I kind of just ended up
playing<00:03:41.669> it<00:03:41.880> for<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.060> really<00:03:42.269> long<00:03:42.419> time<00:03:42.599> and<00:03:43.019> I

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
playing it for a really long time and I

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.300 
playing it for a really long time and I
actually<00:03:43.319> kind<00:03:43.590> of<00:03:43.620> had<00:03:43.769> a<00:03:43.799> lot<00:03:43.980> of<00:03:44.010> fun<00:03:44.130> it's

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
actually kind of had a lot of fun it's

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.890 
actually kind of had a lot of fun it's
really<00:03:44.519> addicting<00:03:44.609> I'll<00:03:45.090> admit<00:03:45.389> it<00:03:45.510> but<00:03:45.750> one

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
really addicting I'll admit it but one

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.449 
really addicting I'll admit it but one
thing<00:03:46.049> that<00:03:46.079> kind<00:03:46.319> of<00:03:46.380> turned<00:03:46.560> me<00:03:46.650> off<00:03:46.709> at<00:03:47.250> the

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
thing that kind of turned me off at the

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:48.319 
thing that kind of turned me off at the
same<00:03:47.609> time<00:03:47.819> it<00:03:47.970> was<00:03:48.000> a<00:03:48.090> little<00:03:48.209> bit

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
same time it was a little bit

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.150 
same time it was a little bit
interesting<00:03:48.750> though<00:03:48.870> is<00:03:48.989> that<00:03:49.260> yes<00:03:49.739> this<00:03:49.919> game

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
interesting though is that yes this game

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.280 
interesting though is that yes this game
is<00:03:50.370> pay<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:50.819> win<00:03:51.060> and<00:03:51.299> but<00:03:51.569> so<00:03:51.720> is<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:51.989> entire

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
is pay to win and but so is the entire

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.960 
is pay to win and but so is the entire
genre<00:03:52.319> essentially<00:03:53.280> probably<00:03:53.669> other<00:03:53.819> than

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
genre essentially probably other than

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.430 
genre essentially probably other than
clash<00:03:54.120> of<00:03:54.239> clans<00:03:54.450> maybe<00:03:54.690> but<00:03:55.019> what<00:03:55.109> interested

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
clash of clans maybe but what interested

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.349 
clash of clans maybe but what interested
