00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
will leave it like it's probably not

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.789 
will leave it like it's probably not
very<00:01:12.000> stretchy<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.170> might<00:01:13.320> not<00:01:13.530> like

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
very stretchy and it might not like

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.620 
very stretchy and it might not like
stretch<00:01:14.460> very<00:01:14.729> much<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.270> might<00:01:15.360> be<00:01:15.450> kind

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
stretch very much and it might be kind

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.960 
stretch very much and it might be kind
of<00:01:15.659> shiny<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.470> don't<00:01:16.950> know<00:01:17.250> how<00:01:17.580> much<00:01:17.790> I

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
of shiny so I don't know how much I

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.160 
of shiny so I don't know how much I
might<00:01:18.090> just<00:01:18.299> use<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.479> little<00:01:18.720> bit<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.110> to

might just use a little bit of this to

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.260 
might just use a little bit of this to
make<00:01:19.470> this<00:01:19.680> one<00:01:19.890> darker<00:01:20.640> then<00:01:21.150> you're

then<00:03:20.550> I<00:03:20.610> take<00:03:20.940> two<00:03:21.180> more<00:03:21.390> and<00:03:21.720> put<00:03:22.230> them

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
then I take two more and put them

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.440 
then I take two more and put them
vertically<00:03:22.890> and<00:03:23.250> try<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.460> make<00:03:23.610> them<00:03:23.760> as<00:03:23.910> even

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
vertically and try to make them as even

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.020 
vertically and try to make them as even
as<00:03:24.630> I<00:03:24.780> can<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:25.440> so<00:03:26.190> that<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.460> flag<00:03:26.670> will<00:03:26.910> be

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
as I can and so that the flag will be

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.150 
as I can and so that the flag will be
right<00:03:27.240> exactly<00:03:27.750> in<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:27.960> center<00:03:28.320> then<00:03:28.830> I<00:03:28.860> take

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
right exactly in the center then I take

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.430 
right exactly in the center then I take
a<00:03:29.190> few<00:03:29.700> pieces<00:03:29.850> of<00:03:30.120> duct<00:03:30.450> tape<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:30.840> ice<00:03:30.960> rip

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
a few pieces of duct tape and ice rip

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.320 
a few pieces of duct tape and ice rip
them<00:03:31.650> in<00:03:31.800> half<00:03:32.040> or<00:03:32.310> in<00:03:32.400> smaller<00:03:32.700> pieces<00:03:32.970> and

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
them in half or in smaller pieces and

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.810 
them in half or in smaller pieces and
start<00:03:34.170> laying<00:03:34.470> them<00:03:34.740> out<00:03:34.950> like<00:03:35.160> this<00:03:35.430> to<00:03:35.670> make

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
start laying them out like this to make

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.620 
start laying them out like this to make
the<00:03:35.850> flag<00:03:37.100> then<00:03:38.100> once<00:03:38.280> I<00:03:38.400> get<00:03:38.550> halfway<00:03:38.880> I<00:03:39.420> take

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
the flag then once I get halfway I take

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.570 
the flag then once I get halfway I take
a<00:03:39.660> few<00:03:39.930> shorter<00:03:40.350> pieces<00:03:40.740> and<00:03:40.920> lay<00:03:41.130> them<00:03:41.400> down

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
a few shorter pieces and lay them down

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.780 
a few shorter pieces and lay them down
like<00:03:42.120> so<00:03:42.510> and<00:03:42.900> I<00:03:43.530> try<00:03:43.770> to<00:03:43.830> make<00:03:44.040> them<00:03:44.190> as<00:03:44.370> even

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
like so and I try to make them as even

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.670 
like so and I try to make them as even
as<00:03:44.880> possible<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:45.660> once<00:03:45.810> that's<00:03:45.990> done<00:03:46.230> I<00:03:46.440> take

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
as possible and once that's done I take

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.650 
as possible and once that's done I take
a<00:03:46.709> piece<00:03:47.070> of<00:03:47.310> masking<00:03:47.580> tape<00:03:47.880> I<00:03:48.270> guess<00:03:48.420> you<00:03:48.540> can

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
a piece of masking tape I guess you can

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.880 
a piece of masking tape I guess you can
use<00:03:48.690> duct<00:03:49.020> tape<00:03:49.080> too<00:03:49.350> and<00:03:49.590> I<00:03:49.620> put<00:03:49.800> it

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
use duct tape too and I put it

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.710 
use duct tape too and I put it
vertically<00:03:50.190> down<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.490> center<00:03:50.970> and<00:03:51.180> now<00:03:51.630> I'm

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
vertically down the center and now I'm

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.720 
vertically down the center and now I'm
just<00:03:51.870> mixing<00:03:52.350> my<00:03:52.500> two<00:03:52.560> blue<00:03:53.070> paints<00:03:53.490> and<00:03:53.640> I'm

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
just mixing my two blue paints and I'm

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.490 
just mixing my two blue paints and I'm
painting<00:03:54.180> in<00:03:54.360> that<00:03:54.540> whole<00:03:54.840> little<00:03:55.050> square

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
painting in that whole little square

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.199 
painting in that whole little square
area<00:03:55.980> right<00:03:56.220> there

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.729 

then<00:04:00.209> I'm<00:04:00.360> just<00:04:00.390> going<00:04:00.810> to<00:04:00.959> take<00:04:01.200> off<00:04:01.470> that

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
then I'm just going to take off that

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.339 
then I'm just going to take off that
piece<00:04:02.040> of<00:04:02.250> tape<00:04:02.519> and<00:04:02.819> see<00:04:03.300> how<00:04:03.480> that<00:04:03.690> looks

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
piece of tape and see how that looks

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.050 
piece of tape and see how that looks
and<00:04:04.440> once<00:04:04.890> that's<00:04:05.129> done<00:04:05.370> I'm<00:04:05.640> just<00:04:05.790> gonna<00:04:05.879> use

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
and once that's done I'm just gonna use

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.790 
and once that's done I'm just gonna use
some<00:04:06.209> of<00:04:06.330> my<00:04:06.360> red<00:04:06.750> paint<00:04:07.050> and<00:04:07.290> paint<00:04:07.650> the

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800

some of my red paint and paint the
stripes<00:04:19.370> some<00:04:20.370> of<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:20.579> paint<00:04:20.850> might<00:04:21.090> need<00:04:21.239> a

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
stripes some of the paint might need a

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.390 
stripes some of the paint might need a
second<00:04:21.750> coat<00:04:21.959> like<00:04:22.199> the<00:04:22.380> blue<00:04:22.620> you<00:04:22.949> obviously

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
second coat like the blue you obviously

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.950 
second coat like the blue you obviously
don't<00:04:23.520> have<00:04:23.790> to<00:04:23.910> do<00:04:24.030> this<00:04:24.210> it<00:04:24.449> just<00:04:24.600> makes<00:04:24.780> it<00:04:24.900> a

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
don't have to do this it just makes it a

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.990 
don't have to do this it just makes it a
little<00:04:25.020> more<00:04:25.169> vibrant<00:04:25.470> and<00:04:25.800> bright<00:04:26.190> then

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
little more vibrant and bright then

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.180 
little more vibrant and bright then
taking<00:04:27.360> my<00:04:27.389> fabric<00:04:28.020> glue<00:04:28.139> I'm<00:04:28.410> just<00:04:28.620> gonna<00:04:28.800> put

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
jewels right on I'm also using the brush

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:37.730 
jewels right on I'm also using the brush
to<00:04:36.030> clean<00:04:36.270> up<00:04:36.389> any<00:04:36.630> glue<00:04:37.050> that<00:04:37.260> you<00:04:37.320> can<00:04:37.530> see

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
to clean up any glue that you can see

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.920 
to clean up any glue that you can see
from<00:04:38.010> the<00:04:38.100> edges<00:04:38.520> of<00:04:38.639> the<00:04:38.729> jewels<00:04:38.970> and<00:04:39.330> also

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
from the edges of the jewels and also

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.140 
from the edges of the jewels and also
moving<00:04:40.470> them<00:04:40.620> ever<00:04:41.070> so<00:04:41.280> slightly<00:04:41.610> to<00:04:41.729> get<00:04:41.940> them

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
moving them ever so slightly to get them

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.580 
moving them ever so slightly to get them
into<00:04:42.389> the<00:04:42.419> spot<00:04:42.780> that<00:04:42.810> I<00:04:43.020> want<00:04:43.410> them<00:04:43.650> in<00:04:45.590> once

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
into the spot that I want them in once

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.260 
into the spot that I want them in once
that's<00:04:46.830> dried<00:04:47.220> a<00:04:47.250> little<00:04:47.340> bit<00:04:47.669> you<00:04:47.820> can<00:04:47.970> take

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
that's dried a little bit you can take

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.310 
that's dried a little bit you can take
off<00:04:48.479> the<00:04:48.780> tape<00:04:49.050> and<00:04:49.229> see<00:04:49.740> how<00:04:49.979> it<00:04:50.160> looks<00:04:50.460> and

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
off the tape and see how it looks and

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.810 
off the tape and see how it looks and
now's<00:04:52.320> a<00:04:52.350> time<00:04:52.680> for<00:04:52.919> a<00:04:52.950> touch-up<00:04:53.190> so<00:04:53.639> if<00:04:53.700> you

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
now's a time for a touch-up so if you

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.550 
now's a time for a touch-up so if you
messed<00:04:54.060> up<00:04:54.300> anywhere<00:04:54.690> you<00:04:54.930> can<00:04:55.080> just<00:04:55.260> go<00:04:55.410> back

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
messed up anywhere you can just go back

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.770 
messed up anywhere you can just go back
over<00:04:55.830> with<00:04:56.130> the<00:04:56.190> brush<00:04:56.580> a<00:04:56.850> small<00:04:57.240> detailed

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
over with the brush a small detailed

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.650 
over with the brush a small detailed
brush<00:04:58.199> works<00:04:58.530> best<00:04:58.919> and<00:04:59.400> I<00:04:59.820> am<00:04:59.940> just<00:05:00.180> touching

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
brush works best and I am just touching

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.690 
brush works best and I am just touching
up<00:05:00.750> any<00:05:00.960> areas<00:05:01.380> that<00:05:01.410> I<00:05:01.590> don't<00:05:01.889> like<00:05:02.070> or<00:05:02.310> that

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
up any areas that I don't like or that

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:18.960 
up any areas that I don't like or that
could<00:05:02.910> be<00:05:02.970> fixed<00:05:03.270> a<00:05:03.479> little<00:05:03.600> bit<00:05:03.840> better

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.370 

once<00:05:19.970> I'm<00:05:20.120> happy<00:05:20.300> with<00:05:20.540> the<00:05:20.690> way<00:05:20.810> it<00:05:20.960> looks<00:05:21.230> I'm

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
once I'm happy with the way it looks I'm

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.080
