00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.549
 you may welcome to a new round 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.549
 mellon call of duty times the wood stove 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:19.890
 new weapon has been with the shoots and 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.380
 then it just explodes 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.699
 now what strange one be careful 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.410
 again a child at one 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:31.850
 ridiculous corner but once you go 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.920
 know that there was a nhl immediately put away 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.270
 there must try everything to the child 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.649
 It will be difficult for him to do that 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.989
 and then he leaves in frustration 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.309
 Sitting and helping his controller 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.100
 against which you have the truth 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.840
 found out 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.640
 throw the controller against the wall 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.920
 I'll tell you it will be done that way 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.719
 the spÃ¶ is everything possible is extra 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.100
 so bugged built programmed with it 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.340
 you are always upset and 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.809
 Sometime that much frustration has that one 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.550
 throws the controller against the wall and 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.110
 There you have to buy a better one 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:10.369
 buy a new and again 16 70 euro 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:15.030
 spend for new better controller 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:16.710
 then you have just this frustration this 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.200
 problems saved me that one 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.390
 verbal believe i thank you at the time 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.860
 That frustration of having your controller 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.360
 is against the wall because we are already in 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.189
 you have said the last consequence 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.450
 someone saw or heard his 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.560
 mouse and keyboard from the window 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.180
 I did not throw 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.490
 because mouse and keyboard you can 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:40.380
 get much cheaper from the store 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.440
 and from the internet hey I have it 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:48.230
 perfectly beaten 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:50.480
 Well then , yes, I have never 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.490
 a mouse and keyboard are part of it 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.120
 one already for 15 euros 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:06.980
 normal and normal are usually enough 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:08.300
 off and stop as I said at controller 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.580
 you can get that already 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.230
 You can get it, too 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.320
 cheap control but the bring in the 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.390
 normal cases are not much and now 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.790
 not as cool as the ps4 controller 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.530
 example so I find ps controller 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:26.890
 succeeded and if I should die 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:34.750
 then it can only be because of that 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:34.750
 mister agent 74 has killed me 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.110
 the same is true for the nintendo 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.260
 there has never been a game there 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:50.480
 what frustration is there or what frustrating 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:52.610
 is the motto we are in love with 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.680
 contrary to microsoft and sony 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.120
 bring the game to market like neck 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.120
 bring shortening 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.810
 because the teno whole can not do it 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:07.190
 make people adapt 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.850
 because they give me the console war 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:15.860
 clearly lost from this generation 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:17.450
 poor pigs well in trade 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.819
 general politics I do 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.380
 can not understand 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.510
 be it with the let's play politics there 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.730
 Is there something that is really funny? 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.410
 if you had to make the tendence place 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.260
 then you have your channel on the rhine to the 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:36.380
 tenne let's play channel 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:37.940
 then you have to if you have to do it 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.450
 sign up for nintendo and 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.579
 Nintendo is the first money you 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.590
 First we will earn are the end 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:49.430
 and then he will have a share 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.350
 something very clever of it 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.030
 nintendo wii imagine how 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.519
 a lot he probably will 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.450
 People only give one nintendo let's 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.450
 will make play 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.120
 I mean watchman looks so hard 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.190
 criticized the decision of 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:10.600
 nintendos whose content that can with it 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:12.640
 Do what you want but has come this 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.130
 china this politics china from nintendo 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.120
 I do not like it 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:22.900
 and yes, if you stop 39 italo channel up 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.220
 then makes it just that I think the 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.440
 the main reason is not the money 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.620
 but actually there is this logic one 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.720
 Only that of which one may only that 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.930
 will be just like if you want to be sony 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:38.050
 may only upload as place with 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.740
 the playstation pc and everything else is 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.230
 forbidden 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.910
 that is not synonymous but one 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.460
 Healthy, healthy company does it 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.050
 which does not stop and as already said 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.270
 the technologies first of all the money 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.370
 gather and imagine you are 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.610
 not the only one of the nintendo's 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.810
 first managed money on the account 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.480
 how many are they from the 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.210
 interest again to make a little profit 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:03.550
 because let's say if these are not 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.740
 I do not know how much I can say 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.890
 it's diced now i dont know 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:11.880
 how much that would be, say 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:17.530
 200,000 I get a few hundred 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:19.090
 interest rates every month 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.320
 and eventually it will be more and more because 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:25.150
 then there are more and more people out there 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:26.710
 want to introduce nintendo games yes and 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.120
 then, of course, someday 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.030
 probably also the tender exceptions 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.520
 because so the big players dane very much 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.320
 because they have such a wide range 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.060
 mentioned range is very on youtube 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:41.919
 very important bullshit 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:44.310
 I've always been one of those too 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:47.350
 this youtube statistics shit shit 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.830
 because I'm not interested in any 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.570
 case 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.490
 I do my thing I have always 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.530
 made that way because I want that 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:57.310
 These days, one tick different but im 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:59.860
 Normally I do not do what I do 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:02.890
 I made it years ago 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.990
 just just for fun took off 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.550
 an animal 31.10 is back 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:11.430
 Just this boy has something wrong with 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.430
 the shelf until next time bye
