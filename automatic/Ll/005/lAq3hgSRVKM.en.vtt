worked down past the any neck or damaged
you<00:01:07.220> can<00:01:07.250> also<00:01:07.550> use<00:01:07.970> a<00:01:08.000> block<00:01:08.540> of<00:01:08.750> wood<00:01:08.780> like

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
you can also use a block of wood like

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.550 
you can also use a block of wood like
this<00:01:09.409> a<00:01:09.440> flat<00:01:09.830> block<00:01:10.159> with<00:01:10.580> sandpaper<00:01:11.560> we

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
this a flat block with sandpaper we

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.280 
this a flat block with sandpaper we
actually<00:01:12.890> have<00:01:13.100> grips<00:01:13.820> in<00:01:14.480> this<00:01:14.870> adhesive

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
actually have grips in this adhesive

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.460 
actually have grips in this adhesive
back<00:01:15.680> paper<00:01:15.950> that<00:01:16.310> range<00:01:16.550> from<00:01:16.910> 80<00:01:17.510> to<00:01:17.870> 400

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
back paper that range from 80 to 400

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.080 
back paper that range from 80 to 400
grit<00:01:18.650> we<00:01:18.920> do<00:01:19.070> 80<00:01:19.340> 180<00:01:20.000> 220<00:01:20.810> and<00:01:21.110> 400<00:01:21.650> grit<00:01:22.090> it's

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
grit we do 80 180 220 and 400 grit it's

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.410 
grit we do 80 180 220 and 400 grit it's
nice<00:01:23.300> because<00:01:23.540> it<00:01:23.690> just<00:01:23.780> sticks<00:01:24.320> right<00:01:24.680> now

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
nice because it just sticks right now

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.090 
nice because it just sticks right now
another<00:01:26.420> trick<00:01:26.720> you<00:01:26.750> can<00:01:26.900> do<00:01:27.230> to<00:01:27.260> make<00:01:27.590> this<00:01:27.830> a

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
another trick you can do to make this a

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.550 
another trick you can do to make this a
little<00:01:28.250> easier<00:01:28.460> is<00:01:28.970> to<00:01:29.300> take<00:01:29.540> the<00:01:29.780> plain<00:01:30.050> blade

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
little easier is to take the plain blade

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.180 
little easier is to take the plain blade
in<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:31.100> tool<00:01:31.310> and<00:01:31.670> run<00:01:32.480> a<00:01:32.510> trough<00:01:32.870> in<00:01:33.590> the

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
in the tool and run a trough in the

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.100 
in the tool and run a trough in the
block<00:01:34.430> that<00:01:34.640> you're<00:01:34.760> gonna<00:01:34.880> work<00:01:35.180> then<00:01:35.900> you're

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
block that you're gonna work then you're

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.100 
block that you're gonna work then you're
matching<00:01:36.350> the<00:01:36.950> radius<00:01:37.340> exactly<00:01:37.970> if<00:01:38.630> not<00:01:38.930> if

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
matching the radius exactly if not if

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.200 
matching the radius exactly if not if
you<00:01:39.200> have<00:01:39.350> a<00:01:39.380> flat<00:01:39.650> block<00:01:39.920> like<00:01:40.220> this<00:01:40.250> again

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
you have a flat block like this again

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.330 
you have a flat block like this again
just<00:01:41.240> follow<00:01:41.800> the<00:01:42.800> angle<00:01:44.620> and<00:01:45.620> dress<00:01:45.980> it<00:01:46.160> down

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
just follow the angle and dress it down

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.640 
just follow the angle and dress it down
to<00:01:46.610> where<00:01:47.120> you<00:01:47.240> need<00:01:47.390> it<00:01:50.320> when<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:51.440> blades

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
to where you need it when the blades

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.160 
to where you need it when the blades
been<00:01:51.890> all<00:01:52.010> cleaned<00:01:52.340> up

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
been all cleaned up

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.840 
been all cleaned up
take<00:01:54.170> off<00:01:54.380> any<00:01:54.590> bird<00:01:54.890> that<00:01:54.920> might<00:01:55.250> be<00:01:55.430> on<00:01:55.580> there

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
take off any bird that might be on there

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:03.570 
take off any bird that might be on there
and<00:01:57.640> then<00:01:58.640> working<00:01:59.060> on<00:01:59.150> a<00:01:59.180> 1,000<00:01:59.780> grit<00:01:59.900> stone<00:02:00.080> I

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.800 

can<00:02:04.580> do<00:02:04.730> this<00:02:04.880> freehand<00:02:07.239> by<00:02:08.239> finding<00:02:08.690> the

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
can do this freehand by finding the

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.339 
can do this freehand by finding the
registration<00:02:09.500> point<00:02:09.709> for<00:02:09.979> the<00:02:10.039> bevel<00:02:10.369> and

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
side to side across the stone also move

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.280 
side to side across the stone also move
your<00:02:21.830> body<00:02:22.070> front<00:02:22.880> to<00:02:23.060> back

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.350 

go<00:02:27.290> up<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:27.680> back<00:02:27.890> you<00:02:28.700> can<00:02:28.849> create<00:02:29.090> a<00:02:29.150> series

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
go up and back you can create a series

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.069 
go up and back you can create a series
of<00:02:29.510> exes<00:02:30.040> and<00:02:31.360> usually<00:02:32.360> up<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:32.689> back<00:02:32.840> is

to side one of the things about the this
blade<00:03:00.889> is<00:03:01.099> because<00:03:01.459> of<00:03:01.609> the<00:03:01.700> radius<00:03:02.090> on<00:03:02.329> there

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
blade is because of the radius on there

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.649 
blade is because of the radius on there
and<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:03.290> fact<00:03:03.530> that<00:03:03.650> it's<00:03:03.859> a<00:03:03.980> roughing<00:03:04.370> tool

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:04.659 
and the fact that it's a roughing tool

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:07.899 
and the fact that it's a roughing tool
you<00:03:05.659> don't<00:03:05.840> have<00:03:05.989> to<00:03:06.170> get<00:03:06.379> a<00:03:06.620> perfect<00:03:07.280> match<00:03:07.549> to

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:07.909 
you don't have to get a perfect match to

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:10.449 
you don't have to get a perfect match to
the<00:03:07.940> angle<00:03:08.389> if<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:09.109> angle<00:03:09.590> isn't<00:03:09.739> exact<00:03:10.189> or

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
the angle if the angle isn't exact or

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.089 
the angle if the angle isn't exact or
the<00:03:10.549> radius<00:03:10.939> isn't<00:03:11.180> exact<00:03:11.689> that's<00:03:12.439> okay<00:03:12.799> so

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
the radius isn't exact that's okay so

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.069 
the radius isn't exact that's okay so
sharpening<00:03:13.790> freehand<00:03:14.239> is<00:03:14.389> actually<00:03:14.720> not<00:03:14.840> as

again remove that bird you want to wipe
off<00:04:44.870> the<00:04:45.050> wheel<00:04:45.200> so<00:04:45.470> you<00:04:45.530> don't<00:04:45.710> transfer<00:04:46.130> grit

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
off the wheel so you don't transfer grit

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.630 
off the wheel so you don't transfer grit
from<00:04:46.670> one<00:04:46.880> stone<00:04:47.120> to<00:04:47.270> the<00:04:47.330> next<00:04:48.160> and<00:04:49.160> start<00:04:49.550> in

the jig is referencing off the stone

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.700 
the jig is referencing off the stone
it's<00:05:01.280> giving<00:05:01.730> you<00:05:01.850> consistency<00:05:02.720> as<00:05:03.020> you<00:05:03.530> work

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
it's giving you consistency as you work

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:10.630 
it's giving you consistency as you work
back<00:05:07.210> as<00:05:08.210> soon<00:05:08.420> as<00:05:08.540> you<00:05:08.660> can<00:05:08.870> see<00:05:09.170> a<00:05:09.640> brake

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
back as soon as you can see a brake

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:16.650

polish<00:05:11.120> along<00:05:11.450> the<00:05:11.600> edge<00:05:12.580> you're<00:05:13.580> ready<00:05:13.790> to<00:05:13.880> go

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.760 

knock<00:05:17.660> off<00:05:17.960> the<00:05:18.170> birth<00:05:20.020> in<00:05:21.020> the<00:05:21.140> 8,000<00:05:21.680> grit

knock off the birth in the 8,000 grit

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:29.520 
knock off the birth in the 8,000 grit
stone<00:05:26.350> and<00:05:27.350> then<00:05:27.440> it's<00:05:27.590> a<00:05:27.620> really<00:05:27.800> good<00:05:27.920> idea

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
stone and then it's a really good idea

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.590
