00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.840
 hello welcome to devour a section 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.110
 that I really wanted to do is 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.960
 it's about using old clothes not 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.880
 it necessarily has to be old 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.170
 good if you travel in time but it's not 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.660
 necessary does not have to be in bad 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.730
 been there are old clothes that were of 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.420
 a quality superior to that nowadays 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.160
 is sold and they really last for years 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.129
 then if you have some dress 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.530
 of the grandmother of the treats of joel la 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.269
 that has a super pretty fabric or the 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.000
 mom or even yourselves but 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:47.610
 that is not that they are not in size but 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.559
 is that the cut is very old fashioned 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.510
 but the canvas love them or not here they go to 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.150
 find several options or several ideas 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.879
 of what they can transform in this 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.670
 first nation chosen this dress is 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.469
 a dress 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.899
 active because it has an old cut 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.830
 he has his hands and also giants 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:09.850
 we wanted mannequins like that 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.659
 the person and the dress is like that 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.940
 so it's good 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:18.420
 it's a very long very long action 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.490
 and I loved where it imposes besides 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.520
 the prints and a little 'animal print' 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.670
 but 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.549
 in mint and blue tones that combine 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.500
 super good I loved the detail of the 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:34.369
 neck is the neck 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.380
 all this super nice piece does not go but 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.719
 The first thing I'm going to do is take it 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.030
 the sleeves and from that the dress 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:43.700
 it's going to change a lot and from that 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.579
 let's start to transform it without 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.039
 rest the dress as it comes 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.380
 We took off the sleeves but nothing because that 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:54.459
 I'm going to leave it then I want it 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.459
 be more or less 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.690
 then I will put root here 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.810
 at the end and I'm going to measure how much is up 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.810
 the mature 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.979
 At the end of the fabric there are 10 centimeters 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.370
 then I will do the same to the other 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.370
 side and I'm going to measure 10 centimeters or well 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.230
 so I want my 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.480
 nothing 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.480
 have an opening up here 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.630
 good as they saw, we do not know as much 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.670
 in the front part as in the part 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.030
 from behind are unknown to the 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.430
 point that we said on both sides ok 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:47.090
 let's cut from the point of 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.610
 pin up ok 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.530
 As you can see, we cut everything 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.590
 we do not know the bottom part and now 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:59.600
 let's make our waist this 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:01.700
 Waist measures 45 centimeters if it is 45 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.770
 for front and 45 for back is 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.210
 established has originally a 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:12.270
 contour d 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:14.040
 90 ok waist ok and my waist that 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.190
 they are not a little smaller than this 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.220
 is 74 centimeters then we're going to 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.980
 subtract my waist you have to measure 37 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.080
 centimeters ahead and 37 behind 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.860
 because to remove 4 centimeters each 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.860
 ok side 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.960
 4 here 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:41.720
 that being forward and back would be 8 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.040
 and 4 for x what we're going to do now is 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.300
 that from the armhole 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:49.110
 up to this point we are going to mark 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.110
 the cut 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:08.720
 it is this part that is the shoulder 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:10.910
 we are going to cut it in a beautiful way 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.050
 let's round it up and more or less let's 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.580
 to 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:19.130
 work where the original stitching is 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:22.330
 let's put it a little bit more 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.939
 ok how 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.470
 and we're going to look for round ends or 

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:27.939
 what better said that there is not a point 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.710
 but be rounded so that 

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:31.710
 he wants a lot more beautiful 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:05:01.209
 and to measure it up we're going to do what 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:04.689
 next we already mark on the body and 

00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:06.939
 we mark on the body how much is it 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:11.909
 that we are going to put him then I will 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:11.909
 take my centimeter and I will go marking 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.199
 in this way 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.070
 until the end 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:30.199
 good 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:30.199
 that's sewing the sleeves 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.950
 you already saw that we did the part of the 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:38.410
 neck and the next thing you do not know in the 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.280
 video and excuse me for that is that we're going to 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:43.520
 join the legs 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:52.270
 I have reduced it by 90 centimeters 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:54.110
 the skirt 74 of puckering the 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.410
 distributing them both forward and 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.410
 behind 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:03.939
 that the skirt is flying and with 

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:03.939
 body then smile truth 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:09.229
 we have to be him 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.699
 but this is how we have stuck the skirt to 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:14.590
 the top part and the final result 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:14.590
 it would be this
