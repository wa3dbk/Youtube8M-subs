00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.790
 we went around the area of the 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.429
 sanctuary to see how much the 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.980
 sale of medicines in poor condition there 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:15.480
 sellers who accepted the problem of 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.400
 Chinese expires is many times if the 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.250
 true situation are besides that it seems 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.830
 if it would take stress obviously of just 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.780
 to be true but in the area it is 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.440
 lends for everything how many people 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:31.500
 of those that sell here are sold expires 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:34.740
 so if it's very normal here, something 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.850
 they sell expired and disguised medicines 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.850
 how is the brand 2 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:48.730
 Well, you can erase this did not happen 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:51.010
 10 here you put 323 this young man until 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.199
 He made a baker to deny that 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.039
 work in this business is medicine 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.039
 cheaper because 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.040
 being in charge no more than picking 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.560
 but you are also in charge of 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.740
 the customers but more than oriental I'm 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.810
 and 29 so many 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.810
 a client taking care of the business 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.090
 sometimes they pay fair assumptions for 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:22.800
 sinners does not mean that people 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.800
 sell products that no longer serve 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.909
 Why do not I do not know no 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.039
 true the one who handled 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.749
 all good for you who sell it 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.900
 but for the people who consume it 

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:37.180
 do not dare for me 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.530
 there is secret information in this mafia 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.710
 hard to confess that they can tell 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.710
 why 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.050
 same purchase 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.050
 retaliation 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.000
 that if there are many businesses 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.729
 it's a secret, the years go by and 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.399
 also the operatives and the 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.829
 solution we ask ourselves how long 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.970
 will take real measures to combat 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.560
 this illegality 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.560
