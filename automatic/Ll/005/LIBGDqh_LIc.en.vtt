00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.880 
in paint I had no real I real idea what
the<00:02:11.450> construction<00:02:11.959> was<00:02:12.080> I<00:02:12.260> just<00:02:12.470> assumed<00:02:12.770> it

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
the construction was I just assumed it

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.229 
the construction was I just assumed it
was<00:02:13.010> probably<00:02:13.310> a<00:02:13.400> wall<00:02:13.550> not<00:02:13.760> like<00:02:13.910> my<00:02:14.090> other

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
was probably a wall not like my other

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.130 
was probably a wall not like my other
other<00:02:14.690> tables<00:02:15.370> but<00:02:16.370> I<00:02:16.400> was<00:02:16.519> surprised<00:02:17.080> by<00:02:18.080> the

other tables but I was surprised by the

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.350 
other tables but I was surprised by the
weight<00:02:18.440> of<00:02:18.769> the<00:02:19.340> table<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:19.880> when<00:02:20.000> I<00:02:20.030> flipped

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
weight of the table and when I flipped

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.289 
weight of the table and when I flipped
it<00:02:20.480> over<00:02:20.630> I<00:02:21.190> found<00:02:22.190> this<00:02:22.310> great<00:02:22.459> quarter<00:02:23.090> sawn

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
time you see this table hopefully it's

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.190 
time you see this table hopefully it's
going<00:03:01.790> to<00:03:01.880> be<00:03:02.000> more<00:03:02.209> that<00:03:02.420> color<00:03:02.780> you<00:03:02.870> see

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
going to be more that color you see

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
quarter-sawn oak so stay tuned and we'll

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.560 
quarter-sawn oak so stay tuned and we'll
see<00:03:08.269> it<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:08.510> next<00:03:08.660> video<00:03:09.230> post
