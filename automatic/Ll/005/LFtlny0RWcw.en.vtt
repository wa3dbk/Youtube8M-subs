how<00:00:08.940> I'm<00:00:09.090> just<00:00:09.360> making<00:00:09.660> a<00:00:09.750> quick<00:00:09.929> video

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460

how I'm just making a quick video
because<00:00:11.460> I<00:00:11.610> was<00:00:11.730> thinking<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.210> bit<00:00:12.389> about<00:00:12.650> what

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
because I was thinking a bit about what

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.910 
because I was thinking a bit about what
would<00:00:13.740> happen<00:00:13.920> if<00:00:14.509> if<00:00:15.509> we<00:00:15.719> were<00:00:15.839> plunged<00:00:16.740> into

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
would happen if if we were plunged into

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.769 
would happen if if we were plunged into
darkness<00:00:17.750> on<00:00:18.750> December<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.590> 21st<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.670> if<00:00:21.630> it

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
darkness on December the 21st and if it

darkness on December the 21st and if it
was<00:00:21.869> cold<00:00:22.260> in<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.680> UK<00:00:23.609> now<00:00:23.820> we<00:00:23.880> would<00:00:24.210> cope

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480

and that will burn for ages now there's

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.179 
and that will burn for ages now there's
enough<00:01:35.350> energy<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:36.790> a<00:01:36.880> burning<00:01:37.150> peanut<00:01:38.189> to

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
enough energy in a burning peanut to

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:49.010 
enough energy in a burning peanut to
boil<00:01:39.490> a<00:01:39.670> can<00:01:39.880> of<00:01:40.090> water
