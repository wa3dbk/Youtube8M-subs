 here who speaks the teacher and please apo 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:14.070
 Let's learn how to download and install 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.089
 the champi he comes an apache but wants 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.750
 php 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.449
 the foot in several options there that allows 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.609
 create our web server 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.420
 The first step is to access the website 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:31.560
 official it is quite simple peace france 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.630
 dot org bar already enters the page 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.860
 in Brazilian Portuguese because he has 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.460
 multiple languages 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.340
 here on my computer in the folder 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.530
 downloads I wanted to spend champ here already 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.930
 has last last installer more 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.260
 recent time if you are watching this 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.870
 video lesson is there is another one 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.480
 version of champ does not matter because the 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.460
 installation process is very similar 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.510
 between one version and the other does not 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.079
 big difference 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.910
 you can see in the download option here 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.890
 You'll always have the version here. 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:13.860
 most recently to whom if a point 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:16.830
 1.1.2 a point 8.3 then already comes php 5.5 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.020
 and if you had a room possibly 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.909
 may have a different php version 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.790
 no matter if you can click 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.130
 download you will be directed to 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.549
 page click here 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.369
 already advancing the download and it is the 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.520
 show hosted on the site only flees 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.140
 net point has here 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.590
 it already appears automatically 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.659
 download in my case it has already been downloaded 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.360
 and in a few minutes and will get on the 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.600
 installer remembering to always check 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.439
 the size of it is in agreement in what 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.450
 is there on the server you downloaded if 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.350
 are the same size will give everything 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.729
 right 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.560
 sometimes you can download a file from the 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.440
 internet it comes with smaller size 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.470
 may have beauty installation problems 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.840
 check this detail there are two pre- 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.380
 requirement for you to achieve is 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.160
 to perform this installation without having 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.050
 problems 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.160
 the first one is to check your 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.040
 antivirus 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.140
 a virus master must be disabled 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.850
 during installation in my case I am 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.010
 using viger I can stay a 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.580
 there is no right to disable it 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.540
 temporarily the antivirus and I will dial 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.180
 here o 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.080
 even the less I want or even in 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.290
 selection 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.900
 ok if I want to remove the antivirus already 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.970
 return here and press the right button and 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.550
 at the same time I can activate it if 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.830
 do you use avastin any other 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.170
 antivirus program you should check how 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.660
 disable it maybe thinking also 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.890
 completely closing it if you were to 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.960
 disable or active option 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.210
 Another issue is account 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.470
 windows user you will open the menu 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.290
 start 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.320
 will write the control panel in the 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.739
 search and access your control panel 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.560
 note that I am using minus 8.1 and 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.750
 if you use is some previous version 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.580
 windows is just you access the panel of 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.370
 control 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.739
 we believe it is both 17 18 and versions 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.239
 oldest enter the start menu you 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.970
 easily finds control panel 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.730
 on the control panel you have to position 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.780
 in this case I'm going to put 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.130
 here the action has to change 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.030
 account control settings . 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.840
 user 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.489
 here he always has to notify and here in 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.010
 down does not quantify and this goes 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.350
 facilitate our salvation so that we 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.500
 disturb 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.360
 returning here to our installer or 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.570
 double-click it 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:54.350
 look in a few moments 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:57.230
 it is initialized and we can now click 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.220
 in advancing this first message is that 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.670
 he said 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:06.050
 the az and we have already set and we can 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.880
 stay okay I can apply here to move 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.620
 note that you are checking all the 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.570
 options it offers 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.980
 This is interesting for us to 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.310
 know each one of them represents 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:21.020
 working with them or at least 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:23.930
 Most can stay in advance here is 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:26.180
 the directory that will be installed you 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.750
 can change normally leaves the default 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:32.570
 forward this option is a complement 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:36.500
 I will not leave it marked here and I will click 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.430
 move forward and here it is already 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.440
 mud 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.930
 In just a few moments the solution will 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.630
 be concluded that we are unpacking 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.150
 files and generate files and 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.390
 all the things necessary for him 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.970
 works and in a few moments the 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.110
 People can already open it and execute our 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.540
 web server 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.540
 here our local rock aquino windows
