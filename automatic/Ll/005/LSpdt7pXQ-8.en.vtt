00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.530 
is really tougher I don't know whether
it's<00:04:24.280> the<00:04:24.400> little<00:04:24.580> balls<00:04:24.760> that<00:04:25.060> really<00:04:25.390> do

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
it's the little balls that really do

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.290 
it's the little balls that really do
make<00:04:25.690> it<00:04:25.870> come<00:04:26.080> free<00:04:26.530> I<00:04:27.120> don't

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
make it come free I don't

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.760

there's<00:04:28.690> not<00:04:28.780> many<00:04:28.960> in<00:04:29.170> the<00:04:29.230> scar<00:04:29.500> as<00:04:29.650> I

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
there's not many in the scar as I

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.970 
there's not many in the scar as I
struggle<00:04:30.160> with<00:04:30.190> using<00:04:30.790> really<00:04:31.650> especially<00:04:32.650> if

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
struggle with using really especially if

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.500 
struggle with using really especially if
they're<00:04:33.190> like<00:04:33.370> the<00:04:33.490> plastic<00:04:33.670> keep<00:04:34.030> ones<00:04:34.210> like

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
they're like the plastic keep ones like

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.070 
they're like the plastic keep ones like
this<00:04:34.780> one<00:04:35.670> it's<00:04:36.670> quite<00:04:36.850> a<00:04:36.880> big<00:04:37.090> one<00:04:37.390> as<00:04:37.660> well<00:04:37.870> so

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
this one it's quite a big one as well so

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.410 
this one it's quite a big one as well so
if<00:04:38.140> you<00:04:38.230> don't<00:04:38.470> like<00:04:38.740> big<00:04:39.550> ones<00:04:39.850> then<00:04:40.270> this

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
if you don't like big ones then this

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.310 
if you don't like big ones then this
probably<00:04:40.690> isn't<00:04:41.050> a<00:04:41.440> good<00:04:41.740> one<00:04:41.950> for<00:04:42.250> you<00:04:42.400> to<00:04:42.580> try

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
probably isn't a good one for you to try

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.870 
probably isn't a good one for you to try
I've<00:04:44.320> got<00:04:44.500> this<00:04:44.620> in<00:04:44.800> waterproof<00:04:45.460> mainly

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
I've got this in waterproof mainly

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.120 
I've got this in waterproof mainly
because<00:04:46.060> like<00:04:46.810> I<00:04:46.960> just<00:04:47.020> mentioned<00:04:47.320> I<00:04:47.740> suffer

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
because like I just mentioned I suffer

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.010 
because like I just mentioned I suffer
with<00:04:48.310> the<00:04:48.970> scars<00:04:49.210> trying<00:04:49.510> to<00:04:49.600> throw<00:04:49.750> it<00:04:49.870> onto

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
with the scars trying to throw it onto

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.650 
with the scars trying to throw it onto
my<00:04:50.170> cheek<00:04:50.440> this<00:04:51.070> one<00:04:51.310> I<00:04:51.640> don't<00:04:52.030> I<00:04:52.420> haven't

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
my cheek this one I don't I haven't

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.920 
my cheek this one I don't I haven't
really<00:04:52.960> noticed<00:04:53.110> any<00:04:53.470> transfer<00:04:53.950> and<00:04:54.160> so<00:04:54.280> maybe

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
really noticed any transfer and so maybe

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.630 
really noticed any transfer and so maybe
it's<00:04:55.930> because<00:04:56.140> it's<00:04:56.440> waterproof<00:04:56.770> or<00:04:57.100> because

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
it's because it's waterproof or because

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.640 
it's because it's waterproof or because
it's<00:04:57.880> a<00:04:58.060> good<00:04:58.360> formula<00:04:58.720> I'm<00:04:58.960> not<00:04:59.140> too<00:04:59.350> sure

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
it's a good formula I'm not too sure

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.710 
it's a good formula I'm not too sure
because<00:05:00.310> I've<00:05:00.580> had<00:05:00.700> other<00:05:00.910> waterproof<00:05:01.480> ones

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
because I've had other waterproof ones

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.340 
because I've had other waterproof ones
