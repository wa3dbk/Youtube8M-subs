lift<00:05:05.339> we've<00:05:06.339> already<00:05:06.490> got<00:05:06.729> ten<00:05:06.969> thousand<00:05:07.449> for

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:07.569 
lift we've already got ten thousand for

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:10.950 
lift we've already got ten thousand for
an<00:05:07.719> initial<00:05:08.080> altitude<00:05:08.259> sign<00:05:08.919> in<00:05:09.129> here<00:05:09.629> and<00:05:10.629> we

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
an initial altitude sign in here and we

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.739 
an initial altitude sign in here and we
might<00:05:11.139> as<00:05:11.259> well<00:05:11.490> put<00:05:12.490> our<00:05:12.610> altitude<00:05:12.909> select<00:05:13.539> in

00:05:13.739 --> 00:05:13.749 
might as well put our altitude select in

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:17.189 
might as well put our altitude select in
now<00:05:14.159> and<00:05:15.159> we'll<00:05:15.879> leave<00:05:16.059> the<00:05:16.180> autopilot<00:05:16.689> for

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:17.199 
now and we'll leave the autopilot for

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:21.779 
now and we'll leave the autopilot for
now<00:05:18.270> and<00:05:19.710> let's<00:05:20.710> go<00:05:20.919> and<00:05:21.069> see<00:05:21.279> what<00:05:21.430> happens

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
now and let's go and see what happens

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:28.189 
now and let's go and see what happens
here<00:05:24.360> and<00:05:25.499> airspeed<00:05:26.499> is<00:05:26.680> increasing

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 
here and airspeed is increasing

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:35.929 
here and airspeed is increasing
swing<00:05:29.199> that<00:05:29.469> around<00:05:32.909> and<00:05:33.909> we've<00:05:34.180> got<00:05:34.419> 100<00:05:35.379> not

00:05:35.929 --> 00:05:35.939 
swing that around and we've got 100 not

swing that around and we've got 100 not
110<00:05:36.939> that<00:05:37.180> should<00:05:37.419> be<00:05:37.509> fine<00:05:37.809> okay<00:05:38.259> let's<00:05:38.469> pull

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
110 that should be fine okay let's pull

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.149 
110 that should be fine okay let's pull
that<00:05:38.770> up<00:05:38.979> and<00:05:40.349> just<00:05:41.349> waiting<00:05:41.680> for<00:05:41.709> a<00:05:41.919> positive

that up and just waiting for a positive
rate<00:05:42.849> which<00:05:43.539> we<00:05:43.749> have<00:05:43.959> now<00:05:44.759> put<00:05:45.759> the<00:05:45.849> gear<00:05:46.089> up

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 
rate which we have now put the gear up

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:52.650 
rate which we have now put the gear up
let's<00:05:48.639> it<00:05:48.910> were<00:05:49.120> off<00:05:49.270> and<00:05:50.160> climbing<00:05:51.160> up<00:05:51.660> so

flaps<00:06:12.400> up<00:06:12.669> because<00:06:12.880> we<00:06:13.030> do<00:06:13.180> have<00:06:13.330> good<00:06:13.600> air

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
flaps up because we do have good air

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.730 
flaps up because we do have good air
speed<00:06:14.080> now<00:06:14.289> and<00:06:15.280> let's<00:06:16.020> get<00:06:17.020> back<00:06:17.080> on<00:06:17.560> this

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
speed now and let's get back on this

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:23.490 
speed now and let's get back on this
track<00:06:18.100> here<00:06:18.610> by<00:06:19.060> clicking<00:06:19.120> axillary<00:06:21.030> nav<00:06:22.500> ok

track here by clicking axillary nav ok

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.790 
track here by clicking axillary nav ok
we've<00:06:23.710> switched<00:06:23.979> over<00:06:24.250> now<00:06:24.550> to<00:06:24.610> NAV<00:06:25.169> and<00:06:26.169> it's

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 
we've switched over now to NAV and it's

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.650 
we've switched over now to NAV and it's
banking<00:06:27.280> to<00:06:27.400> the<00:06:27.550> left<00:06:27.789> and<00:06:28.030> getting<00:06:28.360> on<00:06:28.479> its

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.660 
banking to the left and getting on its

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.340 
banking to the left and getting on its
turn<00:06:28.990> we'll<00:06:29.530> take<00:06:29.770> a<00:06:29.800> look<00:06:30.039> at<00:06:30.190> that<00:06:30.750> and<00:06:31.750> we

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:32.350 
turn we'll take a look at that and we

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.810 
turn we'll take a look at that and we
should<00:06:32.560> have<00:06:32.650> left<00:06:32.860> Timmins<00:06:33.310> behind<00:06:33.669> this

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:33.820 
should have left Timmins behind this

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:38.240 
should have left Timmins behind this
here<00:06:34.030> somewhere<00:06:35.340> there<00:06:36.340> it<00:06:36.460> is<00:06:36.610> right<00:06:36.820> there

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.250 
here somewhere there it is right there

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:45.450 
here somewhere there it is right there
on<00:06:39.250> the<00:06:39.400> flight<00:06:39.610> route<00:06:40.830> altitude<00:06:41.830> is<00:06:42.010> good<00:06:44.460> so

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:45.460 
on the flight route altitude is good so

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:49.350 
on the flight route altitude is good so
we'll<00:06:45.610> go<00:06:45.729> back<00:06:45.940> in<00:06:46.860> and<00:06:47.860> set<00:06:48.849> our<00:06:49.000> final

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 
we'll go back in and set our final

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:57.029 
we'll go back in and set our final
altitude<00:06:51.660> 20,000<00:06:52.660> feet<00:06:53.370> DMSO<00:06:54.419> direction<00:06:56.039> take

00:06:57.029 --> 00:06:57.039 
altitude 20,000 feet DMSO direction take

00:06:57.039 --> 00:07:02.960 
altitude 20,000 feet DMSO direction take
that<00:06:57.190> up<00:06:57.340> to<00:06:57.370> 20,000

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:02.970 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.360 

okay<00:07:04.000> so<00:07:04.900> you'll<00:07:05.349> see<00:07:05.560> what<00:07:05.710> I<00:07:05.740> mean<00:07:05.800> about<00:07:06.099> the

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:06.370 
okay so you'll see what I mean about the

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:10.170 
okay so you'll see what I mean about the
-<00:07:06.639> here<00:07:07.000> see<00:07:07.240> how<00:07:07.330> it's<00:07:07.509> gone<00:07:07.689> off<00:07:08.050> course<00:07:09.180> but

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:10.180 
- here see how it's gone off course but

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.990 
- here see how it's gone off course but
that'll<00:07:10.479> start<00:07:10.719> to<00:07:10.870> swing<00:07:11.139> around<00:07:11.319> on<00:07:11.919> or<00:07:12.819> out

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.000 
that'll start to swing around on or out

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.439 
that'll start to swing around on or out
now<00:07:13.270> it's<00:07:13.509> getting<00:07:13.780> itself<00:07:14.080> lined<00:07:14.439> up<00:07:15.449> with

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:16.449 
now it's getting itself lined up with

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:18.240 
now it's getting itself lined up with
the<00:07:16.569> flight<00:07:16.780> course<00:07:17.139> we<00:07:17.379> put<00:07:17.620> in<00:07:17.770> and

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:18.250 
the flight course we put in and

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.209 
the flight course we put in and
basically<00:07:18.669> that's<00:07:19.150> that<00:07:19.530> once<00:07:20.530> it's<00:07:20.740> fallen

00:07:21.209 --> 00:07:21.219 
basically that's that once it's fallen

00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:23.059 
basically that's that once it's fallen
all<00:07:21.340> the<00:07:21.370> way<00:07:21.490> through<00:07:21.849> on<00:07:22.030> a<00:07:22.060> slight<00:07:22.449> course

00:07:23.059 --> 00:07:23.069 
all the way through on a slight course

00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:25.830 
all the way through on a slight course
it'll<00:07:24.069> follow<00:07:24.370> it<00:07:24.610> right<00:07:24.789> in<00:07:25.000> don't<00:07:25.360> forget<00:07:25.719> to

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840 
it'll follow it right in don't forget to

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.439 
it'll follow it right in don't forget to
set<00:07:26.080> your<00:07:26.280> change<00:07:27.280> your<00:07:27.460> altitudes<00:07:28.030> according

00:07:28.439 --> 00:07:28.449 
set your change your altitudes according

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:29.850 
set your change your altitudes according
to<00:07:28.539> the<00:07:28.659> chart<00:07:28.960> I<00:07:29.080> think<00:07:29.259> you<00:07:29.349> want<00:07:29.560> to<00:07:29.620> cross

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:29.860 
to the chart I think you want to cross

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.059 
to the chart I think you want to cross
