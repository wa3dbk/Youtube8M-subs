00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.010
 but there are moments that turned out our 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.410
 team game and that did not work 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.719
 moments that were requirements plans 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.139
 the game it is in principle carried out beginning 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.119
 match 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.650
 the players control the ball 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.510
 sure enough but final 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.490
 stage of course there was not enough sharpness 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.340
 accordingly, we have not created the moment 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:42.899
 a lot about those moments that were needed 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:45.030
 it was to realize them you liked but 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.800
 I say what I liked the requirements 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.180
 those who were to the players about them 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.190
 did the principle liked what 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.980
 they took and said something under control 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.390
 the ball is not less in this wind gear 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.489
 do they do that they 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.199
 controlled plus these guys who in 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.040
 Basically more about with sheet played 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.040
 not healthy brought good led and 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.040
 thank 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.399
 yochomi battery 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:29.050
 it is rather a question of kreen something brighter really 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:32.230
 Here is the score playing it to you by 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.700
 some scale the sick are needed or just 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.880
 I'll finish what he did with his 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:41.700
 assignment here he played a great principle 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:45.160
 and not flustered and emanated from him and 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.880
 coolly blood in his actions here 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.500
 reasonable transfer competent safety net 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.000
 That is, everything was in the case of no 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.000
 there was absolutely no panic 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 pleased
