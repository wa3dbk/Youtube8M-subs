00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.950 

that's<00:00:04.980> just<00:00:05.520> opening<00:00:06.090> it<00:00:06.270> says<00:00:06.600> f-16<00:00:08.570> f<00:00:09.570> five

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
that's just opening it says f-16 f five

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:22.010 
that's just opening it says f-16 f five
point<00:00:10.320> six<00:00:10.679> five<00:00:12.320> four<00:00:15.800> up<00:00:16.800> two<00:00:17.070> point<00:00:17.370> eight

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.860 

f2<00:00:23.020> and<00:00:24.960> finally<00:00:25.960> F<00:00:26.220> 1.7<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:28.300> you<00:00:28.420> can<00:00:28.570> see<00:00:28.720> the

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:28.870 
f2 and finally F 1.7 so you can see the

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.990 
f2 and finally F 1.7 so you can see the
depth<00:00:29.080> of<00:00:29.200> field<00:00:29.500> changing<00:00:30.010> there<00:00:32.490> ok<00:00:33.490> so<00:00:33.550> this

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
depth of field changing there ok so this

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.150 
depth of field changing there ok so this
is<00:00:34.180> an<00:00:34.360> example<00:00:34.870> of<00:00:35.050> macro<00:00:35.440> photography<00:00:35.650> this

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
is an example of macro photography this

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.150 
is an example of macro photography this
is<00:00:36.310> a<00:00:36.420> close-up<00:00:37.420> f<00:00:37.930> 1<00:00:38.200> point<00:00:38.470> 7<00:00:38.770> is<00:00:39.010> what<00:00:39.130> it's

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
is a close-up f 1 point 7 is what it's

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.610 
is a close-up f 1 point 7 is what it's
marked<00:00:39.670> though<00:00:40.630> there<00:00:40.750> is<00:00:40.870> actually<00:00:41.230> no<00:00:41.379> mark

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
marked though there is actually no mark

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.580 
marked though there is actually no mark
on<00:00:41.770> the<00:00:41.890> lens<00:00:42.070> itself<00:00:42.450> now<00:00:43.450> we<00:00:43.510> can<00:00:43.930> move<00:00:44.260> our

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
on the lens itself now we can move our

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.320 
on the lens itself now we can move our
point<00:00:45.220> of<00:00:45.370> focus<00:00:45.989> right<00:00:46.989> through<00:00:47.020> this<00:00:47.650> flower

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:48.330 
point of focus right through this flower

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.869 
point of focus right through this flower
to<00:00:49.330> the<00:00:49.450> stems<00:00:49.809> beyond<00:00:51.660> got<00:00:52.660> in<00:00:52.780> the<00:00:52.870> yard

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
to the stems beyond got in the yard

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.720 
to the stems beyond got in the yard
that's<00:00:54.879> about<00:00:55.059> as<00:00:55.120> far<00:00:55.239> as<00:00:55.449> we<00:00:55.690> want<00:00:55.809> to<00:00:55.960> go<00:00:56.080> and

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
that's about as far as we want to go and

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.439 
that's about as far as we want to go and
then<00:00:57.730> we<00:00:57.850> can<00:00:58.000> also<00:00:58.150> change<00:00:59.050> the<00:00:59.260> aperture

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
then we can also change the aperture

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.110 
then we can also change the aperture
this<00:01:01.449> is<00:01:01.570> a<00:01:01.600> pretty<00:01:01.839> extreme<00:01:02.379> example<00:01:03.120> let's

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
this is a pretty extreme example let's

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.790 
this is a pretty extreme example let's
change<00:01:04.420> the<00:01:04.629> aperture<00:01:04.930> down<00:01:05.379> here<00:01:05.770> from<00:01:07.800> 1.72

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
change the aperture down here from 1.72

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.719 
change the aperture down here from 1.72
about<00:01:09.400> f2<00:01:10.120> and<00:01:11.070> see<00:01:12.070> more<00:01:12.280> of<00:01:12.400> the<00:01:12.520> flower

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
about f2 and see more of the flower

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.910 
about f2 and see more of the flower
coming<00:01:13.150> into<00:01:13.330> focus<00:01:13.510> here<00:01:14.729> 2.8<00:01:16.680> get<00:01:17.680> almost

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
coming into focus here 2.8 get almost

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.710 
coming into focus here 2.8 get almost
the<00:01:18.100> whole<00:01:18.190> plant<00:01:18.520> in<00:01:18.700> focus<00:01:19.120> you<00:01:19.360> can<00:01:19.510> see<00:01:19.630> the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
the whole plant in focus you can see the

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.530 
the whole plant in focus you can see the
vignette<00:01:20.049> in<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:20.650> corners<00:01:21.390> disappearing<00:01:22.390> as

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
vignette in the corners disappearing as

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.130 
vignette in the corners disappearing as
well<00:01:23.850> now<00:01:24.850> we're<00:01:25.030> closing<00:01:25.479> the<00:01:25.510> aperture<00:01:25.960> up

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
well now we're closing the aperture up

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.350 
well now we're closing the aperture up
here<00:01:26.440> to<00:01:26.820> 5.6<00:01:27.820> and<00:01:28.650> even<00:01:29.650> though<00:01:29.770> this<00:01:29.920> is

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
here to 5.6 and even though this is

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.970 
here to 5.6 and even though this is
daytime<00:01:31.360> shade<00:01:31.930> we're<00:01:32.290> actually<00:01:32.440> running<00:01:32.740> out

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
daytime shade we're actually running out

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.320 
daytime shade we're actually running out
of<00:01:33.010> light<00:01:33.360> with<00:01:34.360> the<00:01:34.480> aperture<00:01:34.840> this<00:01:35.020> closed

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
of light with the aperture this closed

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.190 
of light with the aperture this closed
finally<00:01:37.860> here's<00:01:39.270> where<00:01:40.270> it<00:01:40.390> disappears<00:01:40.930> will

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
finally here's where it disappears will

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:52.800 
finally here's where it disappears will
back<00:01:41.410> off<00:01:41.620> a<00:01:41.650> little<00:01:42.100> bit<00:01:43.260> barely<00:01:44.260> open<00:01:44.590> it<00:01:44.710> up

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810
