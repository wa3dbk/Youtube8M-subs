well

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.880 
well
it<00:00:24.090> keeps<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.420> chain<00:00:24.930> from<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.769> know

it keeps the chain from you know
rattling<00:00:26.279> around<00:00:26.580> there's<00:00:26.910> gonna<00:00:27.090> be<00:00:27.210> less

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
rattling around there's gonna be less

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
then the frame folds right there and you

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.480 
then the frame folds right there and you
can<00:01:51.360> actually<00:01:51.479> see<00:01:52.020> that's<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.950> battery<00:01:53.130> pack

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
can actually see that's the battery pack

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.700 
can actually see that's the battery pack
and<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.970> can<00:01:54.000> charge<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:54.570> on<00:01:54.840> or<00:01:55.140> off<00:01:55.439> the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
and you can charge this on or off the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.690 
and you can charge this on or off the
bike<00:01:55.920> which<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.579> super<00:01:56.880> cool<00:01:57.350> not<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.380> lot<00:01:58.590> of

up and down or completely off and then

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.400 
up and down or completely off and then
that<00:02:28.770> folds<00:02:29.550> down<00:02:29.580> that<00:02:30.180> way<00:02:30.420> there<00:02:31.230> aren't

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
that folds down that way there aren't

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.610 
that folds down that way there aren't
any<00:02:31.680> you<00:02:31.980> know<00:02:32.460> magnets<00:02:33.270> or<00:02:33.450> clasp<00:02:33.750> built<00:02:34.380> in

to<00:02:35.580> keep<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:35.970> folded<00:02:36.180> you<00:02:36.540> might<00:02:36.660> want<00:02:36.870> to

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
to keep it folded you might want to

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.420 
to keep it folded you might want to
carry<00:02:37.050> a<00:02:37.170> bungee<00:02:37.560> cord<00:02:37.590> or<00:02:37.920> something<00:02:38.280> with

carry a bungee cord or something with

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.970 
carry a bungee cord or something with
you<00:02:39.020> but<00:02:40.020> otherwise<00:02:40.440> you<00:02:40.680> know<00:02:40.770> it<00:02:40.860> works

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
you but otherwise you know it works

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.470 
you but otherwise you know it works
fairly<00:02:41.160> well<00:02:41.340> I<00:02:41.670> think<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.120> seat<00:02:42.330> actually

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
fairly well I think the seat actually

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.840 
fairly well I think the seat actually
kind<00:02:43.320> of<00:02:43.380> does<00:02:43.500> that<00:02:43.560> that<00:02:44.130> swivel<00:02:44.550> up<00:02:44.670> and

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
kind of does that that swivel up and

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.010 
kind of does that that swivel up and
that's<00:02:44.970> because<00:02:45.240> some<00:02:45.390> of<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.540> other<00:02:45.690> ijou

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
that's because some of the other ijou

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.750 
that's because some of the other ijou
bikes<00:02:46.230> have<00:02:46.440> a<00:02:46.470> battery<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.220> sits<00:02:47.700> right

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
bikes have a battery that sits right

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.780 
bikes have a battery that sits right
right<00:02:48.240> there<00:02:48.680> so<00:02:49.680> it's<00:02:49.920> you<00:02:50.310> know<00:02:50.430> overall

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
right there so it's you know overall

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.840 
right there so it's you know overall
pretty<00:02:51.300> pretty<00:02:51.810> cool<00:02:52.050> little<00:02:52.320> bike<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.890> I

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
pretty pretty cool little bike and I

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.490 
pretty pretty cool little bike and I
feel<00:02:54.209> like<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.720> know<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.930> price<00:02:55.140> point<00:02:55.380> is

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
feel like you know the price point is

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.020 
feel like you know the price point is
really<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.040> good<00:02:56.220> selling<00:02:56.580> point<00:02:56.610> here<00:02:56.910> it's

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
really a good selling point here it's

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.560 
really a good selling point here it's
under<00:02:57.180> 1500<00:02:57.870> bucks<00:02:58.050> and<00:02:59.030> you've<00:03:00.030> got<00:03:00.240> kind<00:03:00.480> of

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
under 1500 bucks and you've got kind of

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.990 
under 1500 bucks and you've got kind of
the<00:03:00.690> standard<00:03:01.070> rim<00:03:02.070> brakes<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:02.790> stuff<00:03:02.970> that

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
the standard rim brakes and stuff that

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.670 
the standard rim brakes and stuff that
you're<00:03:03.270> dealing<00:03:03.450> with<00:03:03.630> so<00:03:03.930> overall<00:03:04.500> I<00:03:04.530> think

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
you're dealing with so overall I think

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.949 
you're dealing with so overall I think
the<00:03:04.890> components<00:03:05.400> are<00:03:05.520> are<00:03:05.760> fairly<00:03:06.030> decent<00:03:06.720> and

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
the components are are fairly decent and

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.110 
the components are are fairly decent and
then<00:03:07.410> in<00:03:07.530> terms<00:03:07.709> of<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.070> drive<00:03:08.370> system<00:03:08.730> here

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
then in terms of the drive system here

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.240 
then in terms of the drive system here
what<00:03:09.240> we're<00:03:09.360> looking<00:03:09.630> at<00:03:09.720> is<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:10.100> 250<00:03:11.100> watt

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
what we're looking at is a 250 watt

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.370 
what we're looking at is a 250 watt
geared<00:03:11.670> rear<00:03:11.790> hub<00:03:12.090> motor<00:03:12.330> so<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.140> gearing

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
geared rear hub motor so the gearing

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.080 
geared rear hub motor so the gearing
means<00:03:14.100> that<00:03:14.340> it<00:03:14.459> can<00:03:14.580> offer<00:03:14.670> a<00:03:14.880> little<00:03:14.970> bit

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
means that it can offer a little bit

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.150 
means that it can offer a little bit
more<00:03:15.209> torque<00:03:15.660> a<00:03:15.930> little<00:03:16.290> bit<00:03:16.410> more<00:03:16.560> power<00:03:16.800> for

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
more torque a little bit more power for

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.220 
more torque a little bit more power for
the<00:03:17.250> smaller<00:03:17.490> size<00:03:17.790> 250<00:03:18.510> is<00:03:18.660> kind<00:03:18.959> of<00:03:19.019> small

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
the smaller size 250 is kind of small

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.600 
the smaller size 250 is kind of small
but<00:03:19.440> that's<00:03:19.650> sort<00:03:19.800> of<00:03:19.920> standard<00:03:20.340> in<00:03:20.459> Europe

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
but that's sort of standard in Europe

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.670 
but that's sort of standard in Europe
and<00:03:20.940> frankly<00:03:21.720> for<00:03:21.870> a<00:03:21.930> bike<00:03:22.110> like<00:03:22.290> this<00:03:22.320> that

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
and frankly for a bike like this that

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.560 
and frankly for a bike like this that
sort<00:03:22.860> of<00:03:22.890> lightweight<00:03:23.280> that's<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.450> know

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
sort of lightweight that's you know

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:25.729 
sort of lightweight that's you know
that's<00:03:24.780> pretty<00:03:25.260> good

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
that's pretty good

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.220 
that's pretty good
it's<00:03:25.890> not<00:03:26.040> too<00:03:26.220> bad<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.940> battery<00:03:27.269> is<00:03:27.390> 36<00:03:27.989> volt

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
it's not too bad the battery is 36 volt

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.100 
it's not too bad the battery is 36 volt
7<00:03:28.980> amp<00:03:29.160> hour<00:03:29.480> again<00:03:30.480> right<00:03:30.660> there<00:03:30.810> on<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:30.959> down

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
7 amp hour again right there on the down

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.660 
7 amp hour again right there on the down
tube<00:03:31.380> you<00:03:31.530> can<00:03:31.560> charge<00:03:31.830> that<00:03:31.980> on<00:03:32.040> or<00:03:32.370> off<00:03:32.400> the

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
tube you can charge that on or off the

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.580 
tube you can charge that on or off the
bike<00:03:32.850> and<00:03:33.540> again<00:03:33.780> that's<00:03:33.930> pretty<00:03:34.230> you<00:03:34.560> know

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
bike and again that's pretty you know

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.800 
bike and again that's pretty you know
kind<00:03:35.040> of<00:03:35.070> middle<00:03:35.340> of<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.489> range<00:03:35.730> there<00:03:36.390> are<00:03:36.510> 7

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
kind of middle of the range there are 7

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.840 
kind of middle of the range there are 7
amp<00:03:36.930> hours<00:03:37.140> in<00:03:37.290> a<00:03:37.410> whole<00:03:37.680> lot<00:03:37.980> but<00:03:38.430> that's<00:03:38.550> part

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
amp hours in a whole lot but that's part

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.870 
amp hours in a whole lot but that's part
of<00:03:38.880> what<00:03:39.000> keeps<00:03:39.239> it<00:03:39.390> lightweight<00:03:40.250> so<00:03:41.250> you<00:03:41.640> know

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
of what keeps it lightweight so you know

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.820 
of what keeps it lightweight so you know
overall<00:03:42.330> a<00:03:42.600> decent<00:03:42.630> system<00:03:43.140> it's<00:03:43.410> lithium

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
overall a decent system it's lithium

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.070 
overall a decent system it's lithium
polymer<00:03:44.090> which<00:03:45.090> is<00:03:45.120> you<00:03:45.570> know<00:03:45.690> it's<00:03:45.959> like

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
polymer which is you know it's like

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.360 
polymer which is you know it's like
there's<00:03:46.260> lithium<00:03:46.590> ion<00:03:46.830> lithium<00:03:47.100> iron

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
there's lithium ion lithium iron

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.509 
there's lithium ion lithium iron
phosphate<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:48.420> lithium<00:03:48.840> polymers<00:03:49.400> you<00:03:50.400> know

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
phosphate and lithium polymers you know

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.520 
phosphate and lithium polymers you know
it's<00:03:50.880> step<00:03:51.150> out<00:03:51.330> from<00:03:51.540> lead<00:03:51.810> acid<00:03:52.170> and<00:03:52.320> stuff

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
it's step out from lead acid and stuff

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.410 
it's step out from lead acid and stuff
it<00:03:52.800> might<00:03:53.310> kind<00:03:53.519> of<00:03:53.580> have<00:03:53.730> like<00:03:53.760> a<00:03:53.880> medium

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
it might kind of have like a medium

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.000 
it might kind of have like a medium
lifespan<00:03:55.320> but<00:03:55.500> the<00:03:55.560> fact<00:03:55.739> that<00:03:55.800> it's

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
lifespan but the fact that it's

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.430 
lifespan but the fact that it's
replaceable<00:03:56.580> is<00:03:56.700> pretty<00:03:56.970> cool<00:03:57.209> and<00:03:57.450> this<00:03:57.959> is<00:03:58.110> a

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
replaceable is pretty cool and this is a

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.190 
replaceable is pretty cool and this is a
pretty<00:03:58.680> big<00:03:58.890> operation<00:03:59.400> there<00:04:00.080> you<00:04:01.080> know<00:04:01.170> I

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
pretty big operation there you know I

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.509 
pretty big operation there you know I
feel<00:04:01.380> like<00:04:01.440> they<00:04:01.620> support<00:04:02.220> their<00:04:02.370> bikes

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
feel like they support their bikes

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.150 
feel like they support their bikes
pretty<00:04:02.820> well<00:04:03.140> and<00:04:04.140> overall<00:04:04.590> you<00:04:04.860> know<00:04:04.980> this

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
pretty well and overall you know this

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.610 
pretty well and overall you know this
bike<00:04:05.400> rides<00:04:05.700> fairly<00:04:06.540> well<00:04:06.720> I've<00:04:07.500> been

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
bike rides fairly well I've been

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.590 
bike rides fairly well I've been
cruising<00:04:08.040> around<00:04:08.130> parking<00:04:08.970> lots<00:04:09.150> and<00:04:09.360> stuff

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
cruising around parking lots and stuff

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.960 
cruising around parking lots and stuff
here<00:04:09.930> and<00:04:10.019> alleyways<00:04:10.769> and<00:04:11.280> it<00:04:11.370> feels<00:04:11.580> decent

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
here and alleyways and it feels decent

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.160 
here and alleyways and it feels decent
going<00:04:12.120> over<00:04:12.299> the<00:04:12.390> bumps<00:04:12.660> there's<00:04:12.840> no<00:04:12.930> shock

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
going over the bumps there's no shock

anything<00:04:14.880> but<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:15.269> tires<00:04:15.510> are<00:04:15.780> a<00:04:15.810> little<00:04:15.870> bit

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
anything but the tires are a little bit

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.690 
anything but the tires are a little bit
a<00:04:16.290> little<00:04:16.830> bit<00:04:16.950> bigger<00:04:17.130> and<00:04:17.430> they're<00:04:17.549> like

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
a little bit bigger and they're like

a little bit bigger and they're like
Kenda<00:04:18.180> thorn<00:04:18.540> resistant<00:04:19.019> tires<00:04:19.229> but<00:04:19.620> you<00:04:20.190> know

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
Kenda thorn resistant tires but you know

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.099 
Kenda thorn resistant tires but you know
they're<00:04:20.760> they're<00:04:21.030> not<00:04:21.060> pre<00:04:21.390> slimed<00:04:21.690> it's<00:04:21.959> just

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
they're they're not pre slimed it's just

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.590 
they're they're not pre slimed it's just
kind<00:04:22.289> of<00:04:22.350> standard<00:04:22.770> standard<00:04:23.550> issue<00:04:23.700> but

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
kind of standard standard issue but

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.640 
kind of standard standard issue but
again<00:04:24.690> you're<00:04:24.930> saving<00:04:25.200> some<00:04:25.350> money<00:04:25.410> and

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
again you're saving some money and

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.810 
again you're saving some money and
frankly<00:04:25.979> it<00:04:26.220> work

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
frankly it work

well<00:04:27.030> enough<00:04:27.330> this<00:04:27.930> only<00:04:28.260> comes<00:04:28.470> in<00:04:28.620> one<00:04:28.770> size

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
well enough this only comes in one size

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.850 
well enough this only comes in one size
and<00:04:29.790> I'm<00:04:29.910> about<00:04:30.150> like<00:04:30.450> five<00:04:30.720> nine<00:04:30.930> it<00:04:31.560> feels

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
and I'm about like five nine it feels

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:32.780 
and I'm about like five nine it feels
pretty<00:04:32.340> good

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
pretty good

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.760 
pretty good

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
you know seats adjustable up and down so

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.440 
you know seats adjustable up and down so
let<00:04:34.890> me<00:04:34.950> just<00:04:35.100> hop<00:04:35.250> on<00:04:35.460> and<00:04:35.490> you<00:04:36.150> know<00:04:36.240> I<00:04:36.300> can

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
let me just hop on and you know I can

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.470 
let me just hop on and you know I can
show<00:04:36.480> you<00:04:36.690> the<00:04:36.870> motor<00:04:37.250> but<00:04:38.250> first<00:04:38.820> this<00:04:39.180> is<00:04:39.360> the

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
show you the motor but first this is the

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.660 
show you the motor but first this is the
control<00:04:39.900> panel<00:04:40.080> right<00:04:40.380> here<00:04:40.500> you<00:04:41.100> just<00:04:41.340> turn

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
control panel right here you just turn

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.450 
control panel right here you just turn
the<00:04:41.850> bike<00:04:42.000> on<00:04:42.500> you<00:04:43.500> can<00:04:43.650> see<00:04:43.830> a<00:04:43.860> light<00:04:44.100> up<00:04:44.250> it

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
the bike on you can see a light up it

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.700 
the bike on you can see a light up it
shows<00:04:44.670> you<00:04:44.910> how<00:04:45.540> much<00:04:45.660> power<00:04:45.930> is<00:04:46.170> left

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
shows you how much power is left

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.230 
shows you how much power is left
there's<00:04:46.950> no<00:04:47.100> speedometer<00:04:47.340> and<00:04:47.940> that<00:04:48.060> nothing

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
there's no speedometer and that nothing

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.170 
there's no speedometer and that nothing
really<00:04:48.480> fancy<00:04:48.720> up<00:04:49.080> here<00:04:49.700> there's<00:04:50.700> three

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
really fancy up here there's three

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.850 
really fancy up here there's three
different<00:04:51.330> modes<00:04:51.720> of<00:04:51.900> pedal<00:04:52.050> assist<00:04:52.440> so<00:04:52.680> low

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
different modes of pedal assist so low

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.970 
different modes of pedal assist so low
medium<00:04:53.220> and<00:04:53.280> high<00:04:53.490> and<00:04:53.730> it<00:04:54.240> uses<00:04:54.570> a<00:04:54.800> pedal<00:04:55.800> X

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
medium and high and it uses a pedal X

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.980 
medium and high and it uses a pedal X
sensor<00:04:56.310> you<00:04:56.430> can<00:04:56.460> kind<00:04:56.760> of<00:04:56.820> see<00:04:57.000> in<00:04:57.150> there<00:04:57.360> so

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
sensor you can kind of see in there so

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.600 
sensor you can kind of see in there so
there's<00:04:58.200> like<00:04:58.440> a<00:04:58.500> little<00:04:58.740> sensor<00:04:59.130> and<00:04:59.310> it<00:04:59.370> it

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
there's like a little sensor and it it

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.000 
there's like a little sensor and it it
just<00:04:59.780> whenever<00:05:00.780> your<00:05:00.960> crank<00:05:01.200> passes<00:05:01.650> it<00:05:01.800> tells

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
just whenever your crank passes it tells
