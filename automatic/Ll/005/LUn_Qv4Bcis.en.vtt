today<00:00:07.770> we<00:00:07.950> will<00:00:08.040> talk<00:00:08.220> about<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.880> advantages

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
today we will talk about the advantages

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.589 
today we will talk about the advantages
of<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:10.170> suture<00:00:10.500> technique<00:00:11.059> however<00:00:12.059> to

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
of the suture technique however to

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.360 
of the suture technique however to
discuss<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.559> advantages<00:00:13.679> with<00:00:14.190> your

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
discuss the advantages with your

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.670 
discuss the advantages with your
technique<00:00:14.700> all<00:00:15.150> we<00:00:15.599> need<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.839> understand<00:00:16.260> the

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
technique all we need to understand the

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.740 
technique all we need to understand the
mechanics<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:17.340> suture<00:00:17.880> technique<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.539> what

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
mechanics of suture technique and what

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.500 
mechanics of suture technique and what
it<00:00:18.990> really<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.740> what<00:00:19.830> it<00:00:19.949> really<00:00:20.070> does

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
it really is and what it really does

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.300 
it really is and what it really does
first<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:21.660> all<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.619> advantage<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:23.010> suture

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
first of all the advantage of suture

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.400 
first of all the advantage of suture
technique<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.939> that<00:00:24.000> there's<00:00:24.900> an<00:00:25.050> even

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
technique is that there's an even

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.540 
technique is that there's an even
distribution<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:28.010> tension<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.220> is

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
distribution of the tension that is

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.880 
distribution of the tension that is
placed<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.720> create<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.380> fold

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
placed to create the fold

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.400 
placed to create the fold
whereas<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.820> open<00:00:33.450> technique<00:00:33.809> relies<00:00:34.230> on

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
whereas a open technique relies on

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.150 
whereas a open technique relies on
individual<00:00:35.280> suturing<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:36.030> suture<00:00:36.600> technique

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
individual suturing a suture technique

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.310 
individual suturing a suture technique
relies<00:00:38.160> on<00:00:38.280> one<00:00:38.730> switcher<00:00:39.239> where<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.079> tension

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
relies on one switcher where the tension

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.250 
relies on one switcher where the tension
is<00:00:40.910> evenly<00:00:41.910> distributed<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.670> for

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
is evenly distributed and this is for

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.720 
is evenly distributed and this is for
modern<00:00:46.260> suture<00:00:46.680> techniques<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.399> applied

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
modern suture techniques that is applied

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.290 
modern suture techniques that is applied
where<00:00:48.030> only<00:00:48.780> one<00:00:49.050> suture<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.860> used<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.879> evenly

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
where only one suture is used to evenly

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.319 
where only one suture is used to evenly
distribute<00:00:51.539> tension<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:53.100> there's<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.120> nice

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
distribute tension so there's a nice

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.250 
distribute tension so there's a nice
even<00:00:55.260> crease<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.579> formed<00:00:57.020> second<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.109> all

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
even crease that is formed second of all

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.179 
even crease that is formed second of all
a<00:01:00.109> fold<00:01:01.109> in<00:01:01.440> double<00:01:02.219> eyelid<00:01:02.520> surgery<00:01:04.040> in<00:01:05.040> order

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
a fold in double eyelid surgery in order

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.740 
a fold in double eyelid surgery in order
to<00:01:05.400> understand<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:06.090> need<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.330> look<00:01:06.510> at

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
to understand that we need to look at

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.679 
to understand that we need to look at
what<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.080> natural<00:01:07.680> fold<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.430> person<00:01:09.270> with<00:01:09.450> a

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
what a natural fold is a person with a

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.550 
what a natural fold is a person with a
natural<00:01:10.170> fold<00:01:10.640> is<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:12.000> crease<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.689> really<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.530> a

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
natural fold is a crease it really is a

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.230 
natural fold is a crease it really is a
forward<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:16.729> cavity<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:18.030> that

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
forward in that it is a cavity in that

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.200 
forward in that it is a cavity in that
there<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> depression<00:01:19.580> whereas<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.640> open

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
there is a depression whereas a open

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.990 
there is a depression whereas a open
technique<00:01:21.630> relies<00:01:22.350> on<00:01:22.560> relies<00:01:23.520> on<00:01:23.549> scar

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
technique relies on relies on scar

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.800 
technique relies on relies on scar
formation<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:25.280> there<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.460> convexity<00:01:27.060> so

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
formation so there is a convexity so

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.649 
formation so there is a convexity so
you're<00:01:28.140> creating<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.680> mass<00:01:28.920> versus<00:01:29.850> creating<00:01:30.509> a

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
you're creating a mass versus creating a

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.920 
you're creating a mass versus creating a
almost<00:01:31.500> an<00:01:31.619> empty<00:01:31.979> space<00:01:32.280> where<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.939> skin<00:01:33.540> can

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
almost an empty space where a skin can

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.130 
almost an empty space where a skin can
imagine<00:01:34.799> eight<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:36.450> Evangel<00:01:36.869> suture

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
imagine eight in the Evangel suture

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.990 
imagine eight in the Evangel suture
technique<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.159> mimics<00:01:38.610> that

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
technique is that it mimics that

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.380 
technique is that it mimics that
mechanism<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.710> creates<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.579> fold<00:01:42.200> so

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
mechanism and that it creates a fold so

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.270 
mechanism and that it creates a fold so
there's<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.450> complete<00:01:46.409> opposite<00:01:46.920> effect

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
there's a complete opposite effect

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.950 
there's a complete opposite effect
versus<00:01:47.670> an<00:01:47.850> open<00:01:48.000> technique<00:01:48.479> versatile

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
versus an open technique versatile

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.350 
versus an open technique versatile
suture<00:01:49.229> technique<00:01:49.350> an<00:01:50.100> open<00:01:50.430> technique<00:01:50.579> we

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
suture technique an open technique we

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.440 
suture technique an open technique we
have<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.930> create<00:01:52.860> scar<00:01:53.220> people<00:01:53.880> because<00:01:54.240> the

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
have to create scar people because the

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.450 
have to create scar people because the
mechanism<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.110> relying<00:01:55.470> on<00:01:55.649> scar<00:01:56.040> with

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
mechanism is relying on scar with

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.120 
mechanism is relying on scar with
suturing<00:01:57.110> by<00:01:58.110> making<00:01:58.469> an<00:01:58.530> incision<00:01:58.680> and

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
suturing by making an incision and

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.100 
suturing by making an incision and
whenever<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.119> make<00:02:00.240> an<00:02:00.390> incision<00:02:00.689> there's<00:02:01.020> a

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
whenever you make an incision there's a

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.690 
whenever you make an incision there's a
scar<00:02:01.350> formation<00:02:01.590> where<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.369> suture

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
scar formation where the suture

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.020 
scar formation where the suture
technique<00:02:02.850> does<00:02:03.450> not<00:02:03.479> have<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.930> scar<00:02:04.320> and

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
technique does not have a scar and

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.660 
technique does not have a scar and
and<00:02:06.120> there<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.720> a<00:02:06.750> cunt<00:02:07.170> cavity<00:02:07.950> where<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.460> goes

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
and there is a cunt cavity where it goes

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.130 
and there is a cunt cavity where it goes
in<00:02:09.030> so<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.990> really<00:02:11.090> mimics<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.270> natural<00:02:12.300> forward

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
in so it really mimics a natural forward

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.390 
in so it really mimics a natural forward
third<00:02:13.710> is<00:02:14.070> that<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:15.060> suture<00:02:15.330> technique<00:02:15.480> is

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
third is that the suture technique is

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.990 
third is that the suture technique is
dynamic<00:02:18.080> what<00:02:19.080> do<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.200> mean<00:02:19.350> by<00:02:19.410> dynamic

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
dynamic what do I mean by dynamic

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.270 
dynamic what do I mean by dynamic
dynamic<00:02:21.000> there's<00:02:21.600> a<00:02:21.660> degree<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:22.080> how<00:02:22.980> dynamic

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
dynamic there's a degree of how dynamic

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.110 
dynamic there's a degree of how dynamic
a<00:02:23.790> fold<00:02:24.180> is<00:02:25.310> when<00:02:26.310> comparing<00:02:26.760> suture

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
a fold is when comparing suture

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.550 
a fold is when comparing suture
technique<00:02:27.270> versus<00:02:27.990> an<00:02:28.170> open<00:02:28.260> technique

the<00:02:32.610> eye<00:02:32.760> opens<00:02:33.209> and<00:02:33.360> closes<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:34.020> suture<00:02:34.410> goes

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
the eye opens and closes the suture goes

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.470 
the eye opens and closes the suture goes
in<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.580> out<00:02:35.760> so<00:02:36.390> it<00:02:36.780> really<00:02:37.140> functions<00:02:38.120> like<00:02:39.120> a

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
in and out so it really functions like a

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.610 
in and out so it really functions like a
natural<00:02:40.380> fold<00:02:40.940> and<00:02:41.940> will<00:02:42.690> go<00:02:42.870> further<00:02:43.200> into

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
natural fold and will go further into

advanced Witcher technique that we had

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.900

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
the scar aesthetic surgery is a surgery

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.840 
the scar aesthetic surgery is a surgery
where<00:03:11.519> it<00:03:11.730> is<00:03:11.850> elective<00:03:12.330> and<00:03:13.160> people<00:03:14.160> do<00:03:14.670> not

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
where it is elective and people do not

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.310 
where it is elective and people do not
want<00:03:15.209> to<00:03:15.830> show<00:03:16.830> that<00:03:16.860> they<00:03:17.280> had<00:03:17.549> surgery

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
want to show that they had surgery

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.259 
want to show that they had surgery
people<00:03:19.320> who<00:03:19.470> had<00:03:19.739> a<00:03:20.070> modern<00:03:20.880> suture<00:03:21.360> technique

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
people who had a modern suture technique

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.180 
people who had a modern suture technique
the<00:03:24.269> result<00:03:24.630> is<00:03:24.870> that<00:03:25.110> there's<00:03:25.410> essentially

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
the result is that there's essentially

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.940 
the result is that there's essentially
minimal<00:03:26.730> scar<00:03:27.140> why<00:03:28.140> do<00:03:28.200> I<00:03:28.380> think<00:03:28.410> minimal

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
minimal scar why do I think minimal

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.509 
minimal scar why do I think minimal
because<00:03:30.080> with<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.200> naked<00:03:31.350> eye<00:03:31.620> you<00:03:31.980> cannot

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
because with the naked eye you cannot

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.360 
because with the naked eye you cannot
really<00:03:33.269> tell<00:03:33.420> if<00:03:33.900> somebody<00:03:34.410> had<00:03:34.739> surgery<00:03:35.280> or

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
really tell if somebody had surgery or

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.940 
really tell if somebody had surgery or
not<00:03:35.519> because<00:03:35.970> it<00:03:36.120> really<00:03:36.510> does<00:03:36.870> perform<00:03:37.560> like

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
not because it really does perform like

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.100 
not because it really does perform like
a<00:03:38.220> natural<00:03:40.130> double<00:03:41.130> eyelid<00:03:41.430> crease<00:03:41.730> so<00:03:42.630> I

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
a natural double eyelid crease so I

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.160 
a natural double eyelid crease so I
think<00:03:43.260> because<00:03:43.920> of<00:03:44.130> all<00:03:44.519> the<00:03:44.900> bases<00:03:45.900> that<00:03:46.049> we

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
think because of all the bases that we

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.470 
think because of all the bases that we
have<00:03:46.260> discussed<00:03:46.730> the<00:03:47.730> damage<00:03:48.090> of<00:03:48.209> such<00:03:48.360> a

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
have discussed the damage of such a

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.830 
have discussed the damage of such a
technique<00:03:49.010> just<00:03:50.010> faraway<00:03:50.540> outraised

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
technique just faraway outraised

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.259 
technique just faraway outraised
open<00:03:52.739> technique<00:03:53.130> and<00:03:53.459> I<00:03:53.790> think<00:03:54.000> will<00:03:54.120> to

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
open technique and I think will to

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.300 
open technique and I think will to
understand<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:54.870> evolution<00:03:55.410> of<00:03:55.590> surgery<00:03:56.130> of

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
understand the evolution of surgery of

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.420 
understand the evolution of surgery of
double<00:03:57.299> eyelid<00:03:57.570> surgery<00:03:57.890> and<00:03:58.890> asian<00:03:59.250> eyelid

double eyelid surgery and asian eyelid

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.289 
double eyelid surgery and asian eyelid
surgery<00:03:59.579> in<00:04:00.120> that<00:04:00.860> the<00:04:01.860> wildest<00:04:02.280> surgery<00:04:02.670> the

for formation initially started with an

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
open technique because the suture

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.550 
open technique because the suture
technique<00:04:07.950> didn't<00:04:08.579> exist<00:04:09.000> and<00:04:09.440> when<00:04:10.440> the

suture<00:04:10.860> technique<00:04:11.010> did<00:04:11.579> come<00:04:11.880> about<00:04:12.120> in<00:04:13.110> Korea

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
suture technique did come about in Korea

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.009 
suture technique did come about in Korea
the<00:04:14.550> first<00:04:14.730> generation<00:04:15.390> of<00:04:15.450> suture

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
the first generation of suture

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.229 
the first generation of suture
Nick<00:04:17.810> was<00:04:18.810> not<00:04:18.840> sophisticated<00:04:19.530> enough<00:04:20.250> and<00:04:20.579> it

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
Nick was not sophisticated enough and it

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.510 
Nick was not sophisticated enough and it
had<00:04:21.660> complications<00:04:22.560> of<00:04:23.870> forward<00:04:24.900> loosening

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
had complications of forward loosening

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.339 
had complications of forward loosening
however<00:04:26.520> with<00:04:27.000> a<00:04:27.240> better<00:04:27.539> understanding<00:04:28.289> of

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:28.349 
however with a better understanding of

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:32.409 
however with a better understanding of
full<00:04:28.889> information<00:04:29.840> with<00:04:30.840> better<00:04:31.409> sutures<00:04:31.919> and

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
full information with better sutures and

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.200 
full information with better sutures and
better<00:04:33.440> techniques<00:04:34.440> essentially<00:04:35.210> the

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
better techniques essentially the

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.170 
better techniques essentially the
techniques<00:04:36.720> basically<00:04:37.370> change<00:04:38.370> what<00:04:38.879> suture

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
techniques basically change what suture

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.029 
techniques basically change what suture
technique<00:04:39.330> can<00:04:39.690> do<00:04:39.900> and<00:04:40.289> he<00:04:40.409> gave<00:04:40.650> so<00:04:40.889> much

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
technique can do and he gave so much

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:44.450 
technique can do and he gave so much
more<00:04:41.280> power<00:04:41.610> to<00:04:41.879> it<00:04:42.060> so<00:04:42.810> therefore<00:04:43.110> a<00:04:43.710> modern

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
more power to it so therefore a modern

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.189 
more power to it so therefore a modern
suture<00:04:45.120> technique<00:04:46.190> will<00:04:47.190> far<00:04:47.550> out<00:04:48.199> compete

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
suture technique will far out compete

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:54.050 
suture technique will far out compete
and<00:04:49.470> will<00:04:50.120> outperform<00:04:51.500> any<00:04:52.500> of<00:04:53.060> open

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
and will outperform any of open
