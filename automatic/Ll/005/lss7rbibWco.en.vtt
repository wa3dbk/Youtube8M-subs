00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.560
 install pokemon red order for your 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.359
 good, let's start, good, you have to 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.150
 go to the video description link 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:34.250
 that will take you to atl and just wait 5 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.250
 seconds and they give you jump advertising 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.230
 Now you have to give it to download and 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.230
 close the advertising window 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.750
 and they give it back to download and wait 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.000
 to download it I do not download it 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.950
 because I already have it once the 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.140
 file give you right click and extract 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.180
 here it will take a little while since the game 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.480
 has many things to load so 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.120
 I'll cut a little bit and video 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.130

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.770

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:08.320

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.659
 you just have to open it with win the 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.760
 game goes fluid but it takes time to open and the 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.340
 load bar sticks and it gets like 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.400

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.580

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.980

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.410
