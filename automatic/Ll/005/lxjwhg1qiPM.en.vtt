into<00:02:39.379> the<00:02:39.530> desk<00:02:39.799> and<00:02:40.249> do<00:02:40.400> some<00:02:40.430> simple<00:02:40.879> things

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
into the desk and do some simple things

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.909 
into the desk and do some simple things
around<00:02:41.329> the<00:02:41.450> house<00:02:41.659> even<00:02:42.409> do<00:02:42.499> some<00:02:42.709> walking

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:42.919 
around the house even do some walking

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:45.309 
around the house even do some walking
but<00:02:43.639> as<00:02:43.730> far<00:02:43.909> as<00:02:43.939> vigorous<00:02:44.450> exercise<00:02:45.019> and

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
but as far as vigorous exercise and

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.349 
but as far as vigorous exercise and
cardio<00:02:45.709> we'd<00:02:46.310> want<00:02:46.519> you<00:02:46.579> to<00:02:46.700> avoid<00:02:46.909> that<00:02:47.120> for

cardio we'd want you to avoid that for

cardio we'd want you to avoid that for
10<00:02:47.569> days<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:48.260> reason<00:02:48.590> for<00:02:48.709> that<00:02:48.769> is<00:02:49.250> because

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
10 days the reason for that is because

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.670 
10 days the reason for that is because
that<00:02:49.819> all<00:02:50.030> of<00:02:50.180> that<00:02:50.329> puts<00:02:50.719> tension<00:02:51.349> on<00:02:51.500> the

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
that all of that puts tension on the

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.949 
that all of that puts tension on the
suture<00:02:51.859> line<00:02:52.069> in<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:52.430> back<00:02:52.629> that's<00:02:53.629> one<00:02:53.870> of

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
suture line in the back that's one of

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.020 
suture line in the back that's one of
the<00:02:54.019> secrets<00:02:54.349> to<00:02:54.439> having<00:02:54.769> a<00:02:55.030> undetectable

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
the secrets to having a undetectable

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.429 
the secrets to having a undetectable
scar<00:02:56.269> in<00:02:56.359> the<00:02:56.449> back<00:02:56.629> and<00:02:56.930> limiting<00:02:57.319> your

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:57.439 
scar in the back and limiting your

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:59.470 
scar in the back and limiting your
motion<00:02:57.889> reducing<00:02:58.819> the<00:02:58.909> tension<00:02:59.359> on<00:02:59.449> the

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
motion reducing the tension on the

motion reducing the tension on the
suture<00:02:59.719> line<00:02:59.930> so<00:03:00.590> you<00:03:00.680> don't<00:03:00.709> have<00:03:00.980> an

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
suture line so you don't have an

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.580 
suture line so you don't have an
unsightly<00:03:01.519> scar<00:03:01.969> so<00:03:02.840> we<00:03:02.959> recommend<00:03:03.349> that<00:03:03.439> to

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
unsightly scar so we recommend that to

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.860 
unsightly scar so we recommend that to
all<00:03:03.739> our<00:03:03.889> patients<00:03:04.269> other<00:03:05.269> than<00:03:05.480> that<00:03:05.629> it's<00:03:05.810> a

all our patients other than that it's a

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.319 
all our patients other than that it's a
very<00:03:06.049> easy<00:03:06.139> process<00:03:06.709> the<00:03:07.430> hardest<00:03:07.819> process<00:03:08.239> of

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
very easy process the hardest process of

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:09.789 
very easy process the hardest process of
the<00:03:08.419> whole<00:03:08.569> thing<00:03:08.780> is<00:03:09.019> basically<00:03:09.230> waiting

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
the whole thing is basically waiting

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.059 
the whole thing is basically waiting
three<00:03:10.790> months<00:03:11.150> on<00:03:11.299> average<00:03:11.689> for<00:03:12.169> the<00:03:12.799> hair<00:03:12.980> to

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
three months on average for the hair to

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:14.890 
three months on average for the hair to
start<00:03:13.219> growing<00:03:13.549> in<00:03:13.699> and<00:03:13.909> then<00:03:14.389> it<00:03:14.510> thickens<00:03:14.810> up
