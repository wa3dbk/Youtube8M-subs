00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.340
 grab all the colored books that 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.340

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.040

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.219

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.079
 they have blue then this one has blue 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.120

 it will be a shame this 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.970
 my dream 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.439
 Hello 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:04.540
 ready first I will show the books 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:07.450
 read that they are all these and the books 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.739
 more read than with all these all there 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.480
 to take into account that most 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.489
 the unread are almost newly acquired 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.750
 do not judge me later regarding these 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.239
 books will answer questions 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.159
 the first is when these books say 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.659
 What else do you want to read? 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:21.250
 it is a selection sequence of want 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:22.810
 perhaps new that I really want 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.189
 because I want to stay like the games 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.689
 of hunger but of princesses then 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:28.540
 they also use the hunger games and I 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:30.549
 they like strange stories and then it's 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.650
 strange and then with this book 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.690
 favorite without a doubt and without thinking 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.760
 I very much chose compasses that look for sounds 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.220
 loss of souls those of these books 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.260
 which this for all favorite demon 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.849
 I think it was a bit obvious because there 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.470
 supported opted element deported 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.239
 favorites then I think that already 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.590
 you know and I'm talking about the third 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.209
 part of the trilogy of hunger of gift 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.010
 what expansion and is that they leave this 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.959
 beautiful yes now what is the cover that 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.150
 least I like it although there is a visit 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.600
 unexpected to leave then why not 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.400
 I like it 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.830
 of the next question is a book 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:05.090
 luck you would like to buy 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:14.990
 Well, I do not know what book I'm going to 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:17.420
 buy some money and what I found 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:21.080
 more easily was this little doris 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.700
 which is a very blue football and so I 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.230
 I see everyone who is well this 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.000
 video if they want to do it and so the 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.830
 I would really be happy with your videos 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.410
 I love them very much very much 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.370
 I send a super weight and keep seeing my 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.290
 dance life 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.620
 staff had noticed I bring daughters of the 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.620

 Y
