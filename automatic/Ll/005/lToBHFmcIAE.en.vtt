the nebula camo this camo is a space

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.929 
the nebula camo this camo is a space
nebula<00:01:50.970> made<00:01:51.180> up<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.509> orange<00:01:52.380> purple<00:01:52.710> green<00:01:53.490> a

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
nebula made up of orange purple green a

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.090 
nebula made up of orange purple green a
little<00:01:54.570> bit<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.780> like<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:54.960> blue<00:01:55.350> green<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.890> some

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
little bit of like a blue green and some

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.209 
little bit of like a blue green and some
pinkish<00:01:56.520> colors<00:01:56.880> again<00:01:57.810> colors<00:01:58.799> are<00:01:58.920> kind<00:01:59.159> of

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
pinkish colors again colors are kind of

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.859 
pinkish colors again colors are kind of
vibrant<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.820> it<00:02:00.149> has<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.270> lot<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.450> color<00:02:00.689> so<00:02:00.840> I

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
vibrant and it has a lot of color so I

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.600 
vibrant and it has a lot of color so I
like<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.530> course<00:02:01.770> but<00:02:01.860> another<00:02:02.250> reason<00:02:02.340> I

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
like it of course but another reason I

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.459 
like it of course but another reason I
like<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:03.000> because<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.390> colors<00:02:03.689> blend<00:02:04.170> in

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
like it is because the colors blend in

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.530 
like it is because the colors blend in
together<00:02:04.770> well<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.460> has<00:02:05.579> this<00:02:05.700> nice<00:02:05.880> texture
