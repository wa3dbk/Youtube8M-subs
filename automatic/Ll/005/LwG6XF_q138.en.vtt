their whole foot for the break and then
use<00:00:19.170> like<00:00:19.949> near<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.730> bottom

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
use like near the bottom

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.880 
use like near the bottom
to<00:00:23.220> press<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.090> gas<00:00:24.300> depending<00:00:25.260> on<00:00:25.380> how<00:00:25.619> your

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
to press the gas depending on how your

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.269 
to press the gas depending on how your
pedals<00:00:26.369> are<00:00:26.490> setup<00:00:27.080> okay<00:00:28.080> so<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.920> point<00:00:29.099> of

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
pedals are setup okay so the point of

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.510 
pedals are setup okay so the point of
that<00:00:29.430> is<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:30.710> while<00:00:31.710> you're<00:00:31.919> braking<00:00:32.340> to

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
that is to while you're braking to

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.729 
that is to while you're braking to
prepare<00:00:32.879> yourself<00:00:33.360> for<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.020> upcoming<00:00:34.379> turn

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
prepare yourself for the upcoming turn

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.000 
prepare yourself for the upcoming turn
this<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.100> really<00:00:35.400> a<00:00:35.430> racing<00:00:35.850> technique<00:00:37.010> but

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
this is really a racing technique but

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.350 
this is really a racing technique but
you<00:00:38.160> can<00:00:38.370> use<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.760> on<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.970> road<00:00:39.150> for<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.840> normal

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
you can use it on the road for a normal

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.570 
you can use it on the road for a normal
okay<00:00:42.360> so<00:00:42.780> for<00:00:43.080> viewing<00:00:43.230> toe<00:00:43.559> it's<00:00:44.190> going<00:00:44.400> to<00:00:44.460> be

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:44.580 
okay so for viewing toe it's going to be

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.040 
okay so for viewing toe it's going to be
a<00:00:44.610> lot<00:00:44.879> more<00:00:45.089> complicated<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.989> lot<00:00:46.470> harder<00:00:46.710> so

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
a lot more complicated a lot harder so

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.270 
a lot more complicated a lot harder so
we're<00:00:49.050> gonna<00:00:49.199> have<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.470> do<00:00:49.949> a<00:00:50.010> lot<00:00:50.250> of

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
we're gonna have to do a lot of

00:00:50.280 --> 00:01:01.750 
we're gonna have to do a lot of
practicing<00:00:50.940> get<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.900> down

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.250 

all<00:01:02.760> right<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.150> if<00:01:03.240> I<00:01:03.330> want<00:01:03.540> to<00:01:03.600> look<00:01:03.690> important

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
all right so if I want to look important

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.679 
all right so if I want to look important
very<00:01:04.680> while<00:01:05.040> breaking

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.560 

killings<00:01:10.049> over<00:01:10.380> there<00:01:10.820> I'll<00:01:11.820> do<00:01:12.000> from<00:01:12.270> thirds

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
killings over there I'll do from thirds

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.010 
killings over there I'll do from thirds
a<00:01:12.719> second<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.439> push<00:01:13.649> in<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.920> brain

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
a second so you push in the brain

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.789 
a second so you push in the brain
pushing<00:01:15.289> the<00:01:15.380> clutch<00:01:15.670> Rapids<00:01:16.670> while<00:01:17.000> your

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
pushing the clutch Rapids while your

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.919 
pushing the clutch Rapids while your
the<00:01:17.950> side<00:01:18.159> of<00:01:18.189> your<00:01:18.430> foot<00:01:18.729> while<00:01:19.630> you're

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:19.929 
the side of your foot while you're

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:22.630 
the side of your foot while you're
shifting<00:01:20.320> down

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:02:23.160 

watching<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:23.720> corner

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.020 

okay<00:02:24.170> so<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.470> point<00:02:24.709> of<00:02:24.860> this<00:02:25.130> point<00:02:25.790> of

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
okay so the point of this point of

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.280 
okay so the point of this point of
feeling<00:02:26.300> powering<00:02:27.459> is<00:02:28.780> is<00:02:29.780> to<00:02:29.959> prepare

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
feeling powering is is to prepare

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.140 
feeling powering is is to prepare
yourself<00:02:30.470> for<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.069> next<00:02:31.250> turn<00:02:31.580> or<00:02:31.819> for<00:02:32.060> the

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
yourself for the next turn or for the

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.140 
yourself for the next turn or for the
turn<00:02:32.390> and<00:02:32.720> to<00:02:33.560> be<00:02:33.680> in<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:33.950> right<00:02:34.130> gear<00:02:34.459> on<00:02:34.730> the

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
turn and to be in the right gear on the

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.260 
turn and to be in the right gear on the
exit<00:02:35.569> of<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.750> turn<00:02:36.050> is<00:02:36.830> I<00:02:37.580> told<00:02:37.910> you<00:02:38.030> the

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
exit of the turn is I told you the

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.790 
exit of the turn is I told you the
reason<00:02:38.300> technique<00:02:38.930> because<00:02:39.800> if<00:02:40.220> you<00:02:41.800> enter

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
reason technique because if you enter

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.470 
reason technique because if you enter
the<00:02:42.950> turn<00:02:43.160> by<00:02:43.489> just<00:02:43.730> braking<00:02:44.209> and<00:02:44.360> not

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
the turn by just braking and not

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.040 
the turn by just braking and not
shifting<00:02:44.989> down<00:02:45.319> it<00:02:45.530> here<00:02:45.910> and<00:02:46.910> on<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.540> exit

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
shifting down it here and on the exit

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.860 
shifting down it here and on the exit
you<00:02:48.519> might<00:02:49.519> be<00:02:49.700> in<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:49.880> wrong<00:02:50.090> gear<00:02:50.390> depending

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
you might be in the wrong gear depending

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.360 
you might be in the wrong gear depending
on<00:02:50.989> the<00:02:51.080> turn<00:02:51.290> depending<00:02:51.739> of<00:02:51.830> the<00:02:51.860> start<00:02:52.160> then

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
on the turn depending of the start then

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.490 
on the turn depending of the start then
you'll<00:02:53.000> be<00:02:53.180> in<00:02:53.269> the<00:02:53.390> wrong<00:02:53.569> gear<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:54.170> then

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
you'll be in the wrong gear and then

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.470 
you'll be in the wrong gear and then
you'll<00:02:54.650> have<00:02:54.769> to<00:02:55.010> like<00:02:55.310> struggle<00:02:55.610> and<00:02:56.030> waste

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
you'll have to like struggle and waste

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.550 
you'll have to like struggle and waste
time<00:02:56.720> by<00:02:56.959> shifting<00:02:57.350> into<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.680> lower<00:02:57.830> gear

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
time by shifting into the lower gear

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.490 
time by shifting into the lower gear
also<00:03:00.560> if<00:03:00.830> you<00:03:01.010> just<00:03:01.310> release<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.150> clutch

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
also if you just release the clutch

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.539 
also if you just release the clutch
while<00:03:03.500> you're<00:03:03.769> braking<00:03:04.250> without

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
while you're braking without

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.940 
while you're braking without
rev-matching<00:03:05.209> you'll<00:03:05.870> upset<00:03:06.110> the<00:03:06.470> balance<00:03:06.620> of

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
rev-matching you'll upset the balance of

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.520 
rev-matching you'll upset the balance of
the<00:03:07.069> car<00:03:07.280> so<00:03:08.030> you<00:03:08.569> know<00:03:08.660> that<00:03:08.840> drinking<00:03:09.049> motion

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
the car so you know that drinking motion

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.720 
the car so you know that drinking motion
that<00:03:09.650> you<00:03:09.739> get<00:03:09.920> when<00:03:10.100> you<00:03:10.190> just<00:03:10.310> release<00:03:10.610> the

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
that you get when you just release the

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.039 
that you get when you just release the
clutch<00:03:10.940> that<00:03:11.209> will<00:03:11.390> happen<00:03:11.690> one<00:03:11.870> of<00:03:11.959> your

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
clutch that will happen one of your

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.740 
clutch that will happen one of your
braking<00:03:12.350> and<00:03:12.799> that's<00:03:13.459> at<00:03:13.610> even<00:03:13.940> higher<00:03:13.970> rpms

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
braking and that's at even higher rpms

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.400 
braking and that's at even higher rpms
so<00:03:15.080> then

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
so then

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.980 
so then
your<00:03:18.410> car<00:03:18.650> will<00:03:18.920> be<00:03:19.300> unbalanced<00:03:20.300> and<00:03:20.450> if<00:03:20.840> you

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
your car will be unbalanced and if you
