00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.650
 even and it is until the time the product was 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.720
 When I bought them they offer a 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.879
 plan the operators offer a plan

 to buy with the plan I found a 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:10.079
 tone I got from the operator and I saw a 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.540
 The plan was that it was better for me. 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:14.280
 I liked the plan and I ended up buying a 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:19.169
 Bath together I need to get out a little bit 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:21.720
 a little more is taken into account that the 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.690
 bad side of the device, nor did I 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.300
 the program he 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.300

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:35.000
 This message, people, do not overthrow it. 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.250
 in the chassis thing but it 's always good to have 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.530
 A hood is for you, you have a chap.

 broken to change the little piece a screen 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:50.540
 and another bad side of the product was that it 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:52.310
 His battery does not last so long in the 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.040

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:04.820
 Charging the battery was very 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:07.970
