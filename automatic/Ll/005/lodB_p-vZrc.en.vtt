00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.059
 Today I have a tutorial for you that 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.440
 it was too request 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.599
 many people ask me how I 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.880
 I record my videos so I decided to do 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.230
 this little tutorial there for you 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.180
 So I'll start by talking here about what 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.460
 You'll need the first one of course. 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.080
 You're going to need an iphone or ipad 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.060
 You will need a computer in the 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.099
 In my case I use a mac but also 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.990
 works for windows this tutorial is 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.880
 You'll realize that you need the program. 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.189
 called reflection which is the program that 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.880
 mirror your iphone or ipad on your 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.530
 computer 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.600
 there you will also need a 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.579
 recorder on which you are recording your 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.399
 computer because there you want to do it 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.620
 a video of your iphone or ipad you go 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.989
 need mirroring on your iphone or ipad 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.180
 your computer and then record your 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.730
 screen and in case you need you will use 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.340
 a video editor that in my case I 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.020
 use was in the corner and ready is for mac 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.940
 but then a tip for you that uses 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.399
 windows would be sony vegas he is well 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.350
 simple and easy to use and is very good 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.969
 this video will have two parts to 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.530
 first part will be explaining how 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.930
 is done to mirror the program of 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.270
 computer to record and the second part 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.520
 about the issue because because many 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.070
 people want to mirror iphone or ipad 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.049
 on the computer not only to record but 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.850
 make a presentation if I know 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.549
 you are teacher and presenting the room 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.869
 at work this program will help you 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.880
 so let's get the guys the first 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.790
 step you will need to enter the 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.009
 google and search by name reflects a 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.930
 ep or if you prefer click on a link that 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.210
 will be in the description for the 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.400
 program or program costs $ 15 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.890
 As you can see, it works as 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.320
 I spoke to mec for windows 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.720
 it only serves to mirror your 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.520
 iphone or ipad on your computer 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.990
 accepting up to two devices at the same 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.930
 time then you will have to make the 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.340
 purchase or download and install the galley 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.110
 After you make the purchase you will have 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.490
 install the program and opened the 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.890
 program you will have to 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.990
 make sure that your device and your 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.640
 computer are connected to the same network 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.530
 so in my case I'm here my 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:07.290
 computer is in lucas's network and my 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:09.330
 mobile is in the network 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.220
 in the case of the mec as you can see I 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.209
 I'll open the program preferences 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.730
 to show you some 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.140
 settings 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.060
 You will have to see how the 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.010
 configurations but they will have the same 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.590
 you can choose here for 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.720
 optimize the screen of the device then 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.010
 in case you can throw high resolution 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.200
 the total resolution 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.769
 you can choose your iphone in case 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.930
 the retina iphone the normal iphone you 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.970
 can put the iphone 5 or ipad 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.980
 it is recommended to place in high resolution 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.720
 which will be the best definition of all 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.730
 you might as well have a password 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.620
 to get access in case I do not 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.810
 I recommend do not need this you can 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.269
 also choose the option to start with the 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.920
 full screen choose the background color as 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.360
 iphone lives updating there I 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.579
 I recommend you always keep looking 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.079
 updates after you have purchased the 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.310
 updates are free 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:58.519
 also remembering that you can choose 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.200
 to frame skindÃ´ your iphone in case would be 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.609
 the color of your iphone you can put in 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.560
 black or white 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:04.940
 but there would be an option to like how 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.010
