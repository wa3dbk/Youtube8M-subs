again we actually just have to find a
solid<00:05:53.600> way<00:05:53.990> to<00:05:54.050> transfer<00:05:54.740> this<00:05:54.890> and<00:05:55.190> the

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
solid way to transfer this and the

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.190 
solid way to transfer this and the
reason<00:05:55.670> why<00:05:55.910> I<00:05:55.940> helium-3<00:05:56.660> is<00:05:56.690> much<00:05:56.990> more

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.200 
reason why I helium-3 is much more

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.020 
reason why I helium-3 is much more
obtainable<00:05:57.440> on<00:05:57.920> the<00:05:58.100> moon<00:05:58.250> surface<00:05:58.550> is

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
obtainable on the moon surface is

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.570 
obtainable on the moon surface is
because<00:05:59.540> of<00:05:59.570> solar<00:06:00.050> winds<00:06:00.440> keep<00:06:00.980> in<00:06:01.160> mind<00:06:01.400> guys

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
because of solar winds keep in mind guys

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.580 
because of solar winds keep in mind guys
this<00:06:01.940> rare<00:06:02.240> helium<00:06:02.720> isotope<00:06:03.200> could<00:06:03.440> power

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 
this rare helium isotope could power

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.590 
this rare helium isotope could power
clean<00:06:03.950> fusion<00:06:04.370> plants<00:06:04.730> back<00:06:04.940> on<00:06:05.120> earth<00:06:05.300> it

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 
clean fusion plants back on earth it

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.420 
clean fusion plants back on earth it
could<00:06:05.840> be<00:06:05.960> extracted<00:06:06.350> from<00:06:06.770> the<00:06:06.980> moon<00:06:07.160> by

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
could be extracted from the moon by

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.430 
could be extracted from the moon by
heating<00:06:07.700> the<00:06:07.820> lunar<00:06:08.090> dust<00:06:08.300> to<00:06:08.570> 600<00:06:09.050> degrees

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 
heating the lunar dust to 600 degrees

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.920 
heating the lunar dust to 600 degrees
Celsius<00:06:10.010> astronauts<00:06:10.970> could<00:06:11.270> be<00:06:11.390> able<00:06:11.630> to<00:06:11.780> then

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
Celsius astronauts could be able to then

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.660 
Celsius astronauts could be able to then
shuttle<00:06:12.320> the<00:06:12.410> non<00:06:12.590> radioactive<00:06:12.950> material

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:13.670 
shuttle the non radioactive material

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.760 
shuttle the non radioactive material
back<00:06:13.850> to<00:06:14.000> earth<00:06:14.180> and<00:06:14.450> keep<00:06:14.990> in<00:06:15.140> mind<00:06:15.320> China<00:06:15.590> has

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
back to earth and keep in mind China has

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.700 
back to earth and keep in mind China has
expressed<00:06:16.250> an<00:06:16.400> interest
