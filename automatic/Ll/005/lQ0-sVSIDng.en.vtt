00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 very good everyone here we are in a 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.750
 new gta 5 video online this time 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.400
 I bring a kind of trick that is very 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.679
 simple to do and that many of 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.230
 you are going to serve is very very 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.880
 simple and good because it serves as undefeated 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.000
 in the title of the video to move from 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.560
 sessions for sessions onwards in the 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.170
 that you are with people that you do not 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.859
 you want to be one that is for 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.410
 invitation 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.300
 you know that many times we have to 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.970
 go to the individual mode and we take 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.890
 more in making the game by invitation and 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.110
 so nothing then we have to come to 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.450
 online when you are in a session with 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.800
 people and we give beta creator this 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.600
 way we will take a lot less 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.399
 create the session by invitation that 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.590
 getting into the online swallow the 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.750
 cinematic and all that as you are seeing 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.910
 I'm posting in real time now 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.710
 same to use the creator and see that you 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.510
 will make a game create a career 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.940
 and all that good this makes us mÃ³nica 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.980
 we just give a break and we're going to 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.159
 online directly we give here to 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.050
 play online and session by invitation 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:05.119
 directly because we created it and no longer 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.500
 has nothing else the trick is simply 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.420
 that 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.830
 I tell you, well, if you believe the 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.050
 departure 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.539
 you have to go to the individual mode 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.910
 you swallow the kinematics imagine that 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:19.070
 you are with the police with trevor al 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.470
 final is a mess and in this way is 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.509
 very very very fast and very simple 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.160
 do simply get into the creator 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.710
 you do not have to create anything for the 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.170
 that does not know how to do it or anything 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.630
 is that and as I am already seeing then I 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.670
 here I am already in a session just for 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.360
 invitation, I'm telling you, you can not join 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.400
 no one to you unless you invite him 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.920
 and so nothing, I hope that I have 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.170
 liked this video and well then tell you 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.540

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.910

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.570
 nothing, I hope you like this video 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.370
