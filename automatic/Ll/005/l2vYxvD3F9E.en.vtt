00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.680
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ketchum: In the last lecture video, you
learned about the regulation of hormone secretion

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:12.900
during the late follicular phase. Now we’re
going to move into regulation of hormone secretion

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:22.800
during the luteal phase. So keep in mind that
the Graafian follicle has ruptured, so there

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.619
is no longer a follicle, okay? If you recall
from the previous video when I labeled this

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:37.500
estrogen level here as a C, that was due to
the granulosa cells. Well during the luteal

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:45.300
phase, the Graafian follicle has ruptured.
So there is no more follicle, therefore, there

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:53.100
are no more granulosa cells to synthesize
and secrete estrogen. So what that means then

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:02.400
is that these estrogen levels are going to
decrease. So if we look at this decrease in

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:09.900
estrogen levels here, that’s why the levels
are going down, because there is no more follicles—follicle,

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:17.000
so there are no granulosa cells to synthesize
and secrete that estrogen.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.810
Okay, now once the corpus luteum develops,
and this occurs, remember, within the luteal

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:30.130
phase. When this happens, that’s going to
signal the hypothalamus to synthesize and

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:38.800
secrete gonadotropin-releasing hormone, which
will target the anterior pituitary. And that’s

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.570
going to cause synthesis and secretion of
FSH and LH. So like before, we’re going to

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:53.000
use an A to represent LH on your diagram,
and we’re going to use FSH, a B, to represent

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.000
the increase in FSH on your diagram. Okay,
so now during this luteal phase, remember

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.479
that we have this surge happening in the late
follicular phase too, right? So this is happening—we’re

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:14.170
talking about the same thing again, except
now we’re going to talk about FSH and LH

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:21.400
with respect to the corpus luteum. So both
FSH and LH will target the corpus luteum.

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:27.500
And when they target the corpus luteum, that’s
going to cause the synthesis and secretion

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:36.700
of inhibin, which once again only turns
off FSH secretion. FSH and LH when they target

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:44.600
the corpus luteum will also cause estrogen
secretion. So I’m going to represent this

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:52.600
as a D, letter D on your diagram. So here
we see an increase—follow the red line—in

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:59.069
estrogen that’s caused by the corpus luteum.
And then we also have an increase in progesterone

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:07.500
secretion that I’m gong to illustrate using
an E. So we follow the large increase in progesterone,

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.069
and that’s caused by the syn—by the corpus
luteum that’s now synthesizing and secreting

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.700
progesterone as well as the estrogen.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:23.100
Okay, now with that the progesterone goes
out into the blood stream and then has its

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:30.900
effect. So remember I’ve already shown you
a table, table 22.4, that gives you the functions

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:37.849
for progesterone. Okay, so now how do we turn
off this system? We’re going to turn off

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:44.230
this system using negative feedback. Okay,
so when we turn off the system, we’re going

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:53.900
to turn off both FSH and LH, as well as gonadotropin-releasing hormone. So that is going to conclude the

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.169
regulation of hormone secretion during the
luteal phase. So basically the two hormones

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:06.449
that are synthesized and secreted are because
the corpus luteum has developed. And once

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:13.189
the corpus luteum develops, then your FSH
and your LH can be released, which then causes

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:17.470
the corpus luteum to synthesize and secrete
both estrogen and progesterone.
