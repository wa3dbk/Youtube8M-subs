 beagle remover since our 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.380
 client has a growth of two 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:36.770

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.970

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:59.350

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:03.040
 the surface of the nail 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:06.040
 that our feet are perfect 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.040
 we close 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.870
 and we are going to let the product act 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.330

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.380
 elapse 20 minutes we remove the 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.380

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.380

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.790

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.790
 that they do not mistreat the mine of the nail 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.880
 we remove very well the lateral part 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.009
 the cuticle 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.070

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.860
