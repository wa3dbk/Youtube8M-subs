00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.810 
actually it's a good thing he froze me
because<00:04:43.440> it<00:04:43.620> stopped<00:04:43.950> my<00:04:44.130> alt<00:04:44.340> one<00:04:44.550> I

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
because it stopped my alt one I

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.300 
because it stopped my alt one I
shouldn't<00:04:45.060> have<00:04:45.120> been<00:04:45.240> using<00:04:45.480> it<00:04:45.570> anyway<00:04:45.750> so

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
shouldn't have been using it anyway so

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.500 
shouldn't have been using it anyway so
we<00:04:47.310> were<00:04:47.340> thinking<00:04:47.460> about<00:04:47.850> pushing<00:04:48.180> it<00:04:48.420> but

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510

wasn't that great you can see that in

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.850 
wasn't that great you can see that in
the<00:05:19.290> final<00:05:19.470> stats<00:05:19.920> so<00:05:20.580> there<00:05:20.940> is<00:05:21.030> no<00:05:21.180> reason<00:05:21.360> of
