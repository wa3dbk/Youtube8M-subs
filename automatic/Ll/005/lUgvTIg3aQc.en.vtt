 for the following hairstyle, they wear before a chestnut festival mahogany 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.950
 Use 30 degrees on after the appointment we start cutting the council 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.240
 we're working on a structure of half-length hair here with the 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.660
 Creation of a circular department in the upper income range 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.939
 However, a little more generous on the side on which a few stocks has driven 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:24.929
 want her 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:27.279
 they start the slug candidate 1 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.439
 now go the length 4 in the concrete shortly after long loops and 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.439
 at the same time the asymmetry business successes 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.530
 we take a section down and cut at the same height 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.470
 we work in diagonal sections by indicating the hair and snow 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.470
 on the one hand as they achieve with Rides area

 Dr 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.950
 they work the peak load 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.960
 after the pony area has been marked, we give to the back 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.580
 Field silver 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.060
 we start from a section in the middle and cut into two things 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.250
 can 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.350
 the first from Kreuznach Land from the second in the neck area of ​​long after

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.190
 we work in parallel sections and give that over the 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.190
 prescribed section 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:20.709
 eat 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.629
 because then again questions such as the cut length gradually with the since

 Munich 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.069
 when we arrive at the second game which will leave it a bit shorter 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.790
 In the last section, we work the same procedure over the previous one 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.790
 over there on the other side threatens 

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:49.459
 The last section of this page is shown in the last section 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:50.309
 the gate 

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:52.149
 they draw the contours

 the technique of following 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.939
 then they make the connection to the area he would 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.319
 who work and rent in subjects tuned in and loops with the 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.319
 sheer tip into a rounded angle 

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:57.149
 The cut line will now be in the front area of ​​the side panel 

00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:58.239
 relocated 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.239
 those who have a little shorter 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.999
 on the side that the countries leave at we work in the Wunderkammer

 while passing through in horizontal sections 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:19.999
 how are the FIBA ​​going after again?

 the work on the old AKH between structure of the hairstyle and guess at the

 flat ones do not aspire to red shades around 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:12.129
 Finally we will do that 

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:16.399
 where we highlight the narrower area highlighting nature's own operation
