00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.750
 no 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.050
 1 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.150
 at 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.390
 and good morning and all those who 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.860
 were safe and so we find ourselves for 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.590
 a particular episode since I'm going 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.050
 introduce you to my new server on 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.460
 phil johnston nicht so that will follow 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.710
 at my episode 7 so you will see my 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.450
 episode 8 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.380
 so you'll see on this server then 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.300
 short presentation 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.290
 so the spawn so with 4 aisle 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.690
 primary 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.790
 so that does not really matter 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.250
 because 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.140
 because because watching is a 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:59.180
 open world where we can go anywhere 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:01.310
 where then I have the mini map that gives 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.250
 a little bit so that's the word a world 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.910
 open I immediately bring you to 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.300
 My house 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:13.280
 we are about a little over a dozen 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:19.180
 on the server for now and that's it 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:23.180
 my house i want to show you that then 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:26.660
 so that I have voluntarily made a 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.330
 big building since the last time 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.700
 so on my solo adventure I had 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.050
 really never place so suddenly there 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:39.680
 I got a little I got a little 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:42.050
 how to say appropriate the terrain then 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.030
 I did I reproduced almost 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.210
 the identical what I had made so 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.700
 all that is all that is forge 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.119
 so hop we go into the house I'm 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.119
 am made a 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.310
 I have sixty four diamonds not what 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.070
 I will show you 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.080
 I will go to the times or of 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.250
 pixel by pixel and on the server so 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.930
 that I saw them in the body dance I 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.360
 will show you a little how 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.940
 to do afterwards 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.739
 so I reproduced is a little bit of everything 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.870
 that I had the coffers I have them I 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:18.160
 I put in wood because it's the only ones 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.270
 which may not be open by 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.709
 protection because I have a 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.750
 protection of the house to prevent that 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:27.400
 people are fleeing into my chests 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:31.060
 No, I did my solar panel again 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:34.360
 pixels that helped me craft to craft and 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.480
 the cetc cable so the ice cream fiber that 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.269
 boju i'll show you this so our 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.690
 potato fields 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:45.010
 so that's the m and fire so here we go 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:50.650
 everything I had everything I had 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:52.360
 my name spells hours so see these 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.310
 two buildings strictly identical 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:03:01.030
 Besides the lack ouch block I follow you 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:04.709
 add it flat then no here it is 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.970
 apple design so day it's pretty up 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.209
 for that it's pretty in a beautiful view 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.470
 more and the bass and the african house 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.430
 at telus is 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:19.980
 from another person recalls more his 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:25.140
 name is here then so I put myself 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:27.000
 a lot of trees to robert you have 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.489
 had to notice these little signs that 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.379
 made light is an option 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.519
 in c1 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:35.069
 the installation that can be done on the 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:40.440
 on the graphist skin and I you 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:43.010
 will show all that well no more 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.740
 wait, we'll go visit a little there 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:49.020
 the pixel house 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.090
 this episode will last about I speak 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.750
 maybe ten minutes maximum I do not know 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.320
 do not I leave in the good 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.000
 direction 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:04.590
 no i'm not going in the right direction 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:08.130
 it's over there, here you see you 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:11.640
 have seen the interim message fkt us 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.380
 protect art is a guy so that's it 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.990
 means that I go into the tooth may 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.270
 in my zone of protection zone 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.910
 protection that can be defined in 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:24.210
 buying a diamond 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:28.740
 so it's up to the function to protect 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:30.480
 a little bit of all that you saw so 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.420
 the pixel is not all alone on this 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.510
 installation 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.220
 he's spun he's helped by two three 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.240
 people 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.630
 but look he did some 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:46.910
 machines have against it did not 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:53.100
 secure the place so so suddenly 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:56.510
 can not really can not 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:05:01.230
 to lie have protection 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:04.020
 so he offered me that this is for in 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.610
 made keep the Czechs I you 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.890
 will show how to craft it for 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:11.250
 keep the Czechs 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:13.650
 how to say activated for like that when 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:18.300
 we move away from the place is well the 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:19.580
 machines keeps running I'm going 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.220
 go a little outside 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:25.880
 scream and then you were it just for 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.590
 to show you a little bit about the environment of 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:31.070
 of this server so I have huge 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.900
 planting there a torah mob 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.160
 after 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.310
 there is a lot of time on the server 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:42.610
 so just about every person that to his 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:45.470
 house so maybe will visit that and 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:48.500
 may be doing a multi-adventure 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:53.050
 we will laugh well it will depend on the episodes and 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:55.699
 so it's a nice server that lag 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.470
 very little time is enough 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:01.550
 boring because its vague but it's 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:06.229
 very rare so very well I tried to 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:08.139
 to be a little aesthetic I do not know that 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:12.229
 annoy me this mini map that bug 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:19.070
 finally it's not the bass and the portals 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:20.470
 pixels tec is so here's a little a 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.789
 little place 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:26.240
 so I hope you are impatient 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:28.520
 as impartial as me to have the 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.820
 eighth episode in the eighth 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:35.479
 episode I will show you to a 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:38.150
 electronic engine and then others 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:39.620
 novelties like the one game force that 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:43.250
 you only have I did not have you 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:46.090
 show and it's so I even redid 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:49.550
 my mood to the identical 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:50.570
 I'm not going too much it's the entrance of 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.010
 the mine but I'm not going too 

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:54.220
 venturing into the mine I you 

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:57.460
 will show the gold 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:59.890
 in an upcoming episode so here is 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:03.060
 I hope you are eager to see 

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:03.060
 that and more
