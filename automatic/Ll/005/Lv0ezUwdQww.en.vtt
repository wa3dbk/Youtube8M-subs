00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
when we were dating she was a little bit

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.479 
when we were dating she was a little bit
hesitant<00:00:36.770> knowing<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.010> was<00:00:38.160> gonna<00:00:38.309> be<00:00:38.460> a

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
hesitant knowing that I was gonna be a

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.860 
hesitant knowing that I was gonna be a
pig<00:00:38.730> vet<00:00:38.940> cuz<00:00:39.149> she<00:00:39.300> didn't<00:00:39.480> really<00:00:39.600> know<00:00:39.750> what

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
pig vet cuz she didn't really know what

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.660 
pig vet cuz she didn't really know what
that<00:00:39.930> meant<00:00:40.230> either<00:00:40.379> he's<00:00:40.920> teaching<00:00:41.340> me<00:00:41.430> how

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
that meant either he's teaching me how

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.750 
that meant either he's teaching me how
to<00:00:41.719> kind<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.780> be<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:42.930> swine<00:00:43.230> bit<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.770> as<00:00:44.460> far<00:00:44.700> as

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
to kind of be a swine bit and as far as

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.220 
to kind of be a swine bit and as far as
the<00:00:44.910> research<00:00:45.210> goes<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.660> think<00:00:45.840> we're<00:00:45.960> kind<00:00:46.140> of

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
the research goes I think we're kind of

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.319 
the research goes I think we're kind of
learning<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.829> together<00:00:47.280> I'll<00:00:47.910> always<00:00:48.059> tell

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
learning that together I'll always tell

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.119 
learning that together I'll always tell
people<00:00:48.690> she's<00:00:48.899> definitely<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.379> smart<00:00:49.829> one<00:00:49.980> in

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
people she's definitely the smart one in

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.389 
people she's definitely the smart one in

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
the relationship you count backwards

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.110 
the relationship you count backwards
that's<00:00:53.399> not<00:00:53.520> too<00:00:53.730> complex<00:00:54.210> for<00:00:54.600> my<00:00:55.350> life<00:00:56.120> I'm

so<00:01:15.260> this<00:01:15.440> is<00:01:15.590> our<00:01:15.770> research<00:01:16.250> barn<00:01:16.610> where<00:01:17.180> we<00:01:17.330> do

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
so this is our research barn where we do

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.840 
so this is our research barn where we do
a<00:01:17.720> variety<00:01:18.200> of<00:01:18.500> trials<00:01:18.920> mainly<00:01:19.310> nutrition

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
a variety of trials mainly nutrition

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.120 
a variety of trials mainly nutrition
related<00:01:20.000> trials<00:01:20.600> farming<00:01:21.560> looks<00:01:21.710> different

today<00:01:22.280> than<00:01:22.400> it<00:01:22.610> did<00:01:22.760> people<00:01:23.450> used<00:01:23.690> to<00:01:23.810> see

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
today than it did people used to see

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.380 
today than it did people used to see
little<00:01:24.830> farms<00:01:25.250> with<00:01:25.460> you<00:01:25.790> know<00:01:25.910> a<00:01:25.940> few<00:01:26.120> pigs

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
little farms with you know a few pigs

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.840 
little farms with you know a few pigs
here<00:01:26.840> and<00:01:27.050> a<00:01:27.080> few<00:01:27.260> cows<00:01:27.470> there<00:01:27.890> and<00:01:28.520> now<00:01:28.670> they

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
here and a few cows there and now they

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.730 
here and a few cows there and now they
see<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:29.150> big<00:01:29.330> barns<00:01:29.690> like<00:01:29.930> they<00:01:30.260> can't<00:01:30.530> see

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
see the big barns like they can't see

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.590 
see the big barns like they can't see
inside<00:01:31.070> so<00:01:31.130> they<00:01:31.520> think<00:01:31.610> something<00:01:32.270> has<00:01:32.390> been

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
needs when we moved those animals inside

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.160 
needs when we moved those animals inside
when<00:01:50.030> there's<00:01:50.240> a<00:01:50.420> foot<00:01:50.630> of<00:01:50.750> snow<00:01:50.780> on<00:01:51.080> the

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
when there's a foot of snow on the

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.480 
when there's a foot of snow on the
ground<00:01:51.410> they're<00:01:51.650> nice<00:01:51.860> and<00:01:51.890> warm<00:01:52.310> inside

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
ground they're nice and warm inside

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.190 
ground they're nice and warm inside
their<00:01:52.850> barns<00:01:53.180> we<00:01:53.450> don't<00:01:53.630> have<00:01:53.810> predators

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
their barns we don't have predators

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.770 
their barns we don't have predators
coming<00:01:54.800> in<00:01:54.920> and<00:01:55.130> destroying<00:01:55.910> livestock

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
coming in and destroying livestock

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.020 
coming in and destroying livestock
things<00:01:57.110> like<00:01:57.320> that<00:01:57.560> they're<00:01:58.070> well<00:01:58.280> fed<00:01:58.550> all

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
things like that they're well fed all

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.030 
things like that they're well fed all
their<00:01:59.270> needs<00:01:59.479> are<00:01:59.660> met<00:01:59.840> I<00:02:00.110> think<00:02:00.470> that<00:02:00.740> animal

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
their needs are met I think that animal

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.190 
their needs are met I think that animal
is<00:02:01.190> very<00:02:01.430> comfortable<00:02:01.880> we<00:02:02.570> keep<00:02:02.810> our<00:02:02.960> pigs

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
is very comfortable we keep our pigs

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.320 
is very comfortable we keep our pigs
inside<00:02:03.650> to<00:02:03.920> improve<00:02:04.430> their<00:02:04.700> their<00:02:04.970> state<00:02:05.210> of

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
inside to improve their their state of

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.510 
inside to improve their their state of
well-being<00:02:05.770> today<00:02:06.770> even<00:02:07.009> though<00:02:07.220> we're<00:02:07.430> in

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
well-being today even though we're in

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.699 
well-being today even though we're in
Tennessee<00:02:07.940> it's<00:02:08.149> about<00:02:08.420> it's<00:02:08.810> in<00:02:08.959> the<00:02:09.080> 30s<00:02:09.470> but

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
Tennessee it's about it's in the 30s but

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.580 
Tennessee it's about it's in the 30s but
it's<00:02:10.340> about<00:02:10.489> 70<00:02:11.000> degrees<00:02:11.300> in<00:02:11.330> here<00:02:11.750> so<00:02:12.440> it's<00:02:12.530> a

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
it's about 70 degrees in here so it's a

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.940 
it's about 70 degrees in here so it's a
great<00:02:12.709> temperature<00:02:13.160> for<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.489> pigs<00:02:14.950> what

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
great temperature for the pigs what

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.620 
great temperature for the pigs what
we're<00:02:16.100> doing<00:02:16.400> is<00:02:16.670> a<00:02:16.700> study<00:02:17.000> looking<00:02:17.270> at

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
we're doing is a study looking at

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.110 
we're doing is a study looking at
tweaking<00:02:18.050> an<00:02:18.350> amino<00:02:18.650> acid<00:02:18.680> in<00:02:19.100> our<00:02:19.220> feed<00:02:19.430> so

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
tweaking an amino acid in our feed so

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.060 
tweaking an amino acid in our feed so
we've<00:02:20.390> got<00:02:20.600> you<00:02:21.080> know<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.200> control<00:02:21.680> feed<00:02:21.890> where

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
we've got you know a control feed where

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.410 
we've got you know a control feed where
we<00:02:22.160> feed<00:02:22.340> what<00:02:22.550> we<00:02:22.640> would<00:02:22.760> regularly<00:02:23.120> feed

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
we feed what we would regularly feed

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.120 
we feed what we would regularly feed
here<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:23.840> then<00:02:24.380> we<00:02:24.500> have<00:02:24.650> one<00:02:24.800> where<00:02:24.950> we're

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
here and then we have one where we're

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.280 
here and then we have one where we're
adding<00:02:25.610> a<00:02:25.670> little<00:02:25.790> bit<00:02:25.910> extra<00:02:26.239> so<00:02:26.630> we<00:02:27.170> always

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
adding a little bit extra so we always

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.780 
adding a little bit extra so we always
want<00:02:27.380> to<00:02:27.560> make<00:02:27.650> sure<00:02:27.680> that<00:02:28.100> we<00:02:28.580> are<00:02:28.700> giving

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
want to make sure that we are giving

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.420 
want to make sure that we are giving
them<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.660> best<00:02:29.840> quality<00:02:30.049> feed<00:02:30.860> that<00:02:31.070> we<00:02:31.160> can

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
them the best quality feed that we can

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.360 
them the best quality feed that we can
to<00:02:32.170> certain<00:02:33.170> diets<00:02:33.470> pigs<00:02:33.799> can<00:02:34.040> grow<00:02:34.160> more

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
to certain diets pigs can grow more

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.190 
to certain diets pigs can grow more
efficiently<00:02:34.850> I<00:02:35.150> mean<00:02:35.570> we<00:02:35.630> can<00:02:35.780> actually<00:02:36.049> use

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
efficiently I mean we can actually use

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.289 
efficiently I mean we can actually use
less<00:02:36.470> feed<00:02:36.709> to<00:02:36.860> feed<00:02:37.010> those<00:02:37.190> pigs<00:02:37.519> which<00:02:38.180> is

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
less feed to feed those pigs which is

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.150 
less feed to feed those pigs which is
not<00:02:38.420> only<00:02:38.600> helps<00:02:39.440> us<00:02:39.560> be<00:02:39.709> more<00:02:39.739> sustainable

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
not only helps us be more sustainable

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.120 
not only helps us be more sustainable
but<00:02:40.670> also<00:02:40.880> helps<00:02:41.390> us<00:02:41.540> economically<00:02:41.950> so<00:02:42.950> he's

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
but also helps us economically so he's

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.550 
but also helps us economically so he's
supposed<00:02:43.250> to<00:02:43.489> be<00:02:43.640> delivering<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.560> control

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
supposed to be delivering the control

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.400 
supposed to be delivering the control
feed<00:02:45.830> later<00:02:46.459> today<00:02:46.820> other<00:02:47.390> Sandra<00:02:47.810> has<00:02:47.989> a<00:02:48.260> lot

feed later today other Sandra has a lot

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
of the responsibilities for the research

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.140 
of the responsibilities for the research
program<00:02:51.080> yes<00:02:51.530> still<00:02:51.830> give<00:02:52.250> input<00:02:52.670> and<00:02:52.850> help<00:02:52.970> as

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
program yes still give input and help as

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.240 
program yes still give input and help as
needed<00:02:53.510> I<00:02:53.660> think<00:02:54.260> a<00:02:54.350> lot<00:02:54.470> of<00:02:54.500> times<00:02:54.769> I<00:02:54.950> probably

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
needed I think a lot of times I probably

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.949 
needed I think a lot of times I probably
slow<00:02:55.430> them<00:02:55.580> down<00:02:55.610> when<00:02:55.910> I<00:02:56.030> go<00:02:56.209> and<00:02:56.390> I<00:02:56.600> guess<00:02:56.810> it

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
slow them down when I go and I guess it

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.420 
slow them down when I go and I guess it
really<00:02:57.049> helps<00:02:57.500> that<00:02:57.590> I'm<00:02:57.739> standing<00:02:58.010> here<00:02:58.250> in

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
really helps that I'm standing here in

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.430 
really helps that I'm standing here in
the<00:02:58.519> way<00:02:58.610> I<00:02:59.060> think<00:02:59.720> it's<00:02:59.959> awesome<00:03:00.110> being

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
the way I think it's awesome being

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.440 
the way I think it's awesome being
married<00:03:00.739> to<00:03:00.769> a<00:03:00.920> better<00:03:01.130> noon<00:03:01.340> but<00:03:02.180> I<00:03:02.239> don't

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
married to a better noon but I don't

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.390 
married to a better noon but I don't
really<00:03:02.660> know<00:03:02.810> any<00:03:02.989> difference<00:03:03.410> but<00:03:04.160> it<00:03:04.310> is

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
really know any difference but it is

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.789 
really know any difference but it is
nice<00:03:04.700> having<00:03:05.000> someone<00:03:05.600> you<00:03:05.750> can<00:03:06.080> share<00:03:06.769> a

nice having someone you can share a

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.940 
nice having someone you can share a
