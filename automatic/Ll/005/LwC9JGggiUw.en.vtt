one of the most important features on
this<00:00:24.210> Billy<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.720> it's<00:00:25.019> twin<00:00:25.320> scheme

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
this Billy is that it's twin scheme

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.279 
this Billy is that it's twin scheme
there<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.119> actually<00:00:27.480> another<00:00:27.510> layer<00:00:27.990> under

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
there is actually another layer under

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.750 
there is actually another layer under
here<00:00:28.439> that's<00:00:28.650> attached<00:00:28.980> simply<00:00:29.490> by<00:00:29.609> at<00:00:29.670> least

here that's attached simply by at least
a<00:00:29.880> couple<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.210> couple<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.539> toggles<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:31.410> clip<00:00:31.590> it

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
a couple a couple of toggles you clip it

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.220 
a couple a couple of toggles you clip it
in<00:00:31.890> it's<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.520> permanent<00:00:32.820> twin<00:00:33.329> skin<00:00:33.660> this
