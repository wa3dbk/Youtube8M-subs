is<00:05:21.290> they<00:05:21.500> have<00:05:21.770> two<00:05:22.520> different<00:05:22.700> shades<00:05:23.150> of

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
is they have two different shades of

is they have two different shades of
each<00:05:23.480> color<00:05:23.810> they<00:05:24.020> have<00:05:24.140> two<00:05:24.320> different

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.390

because<00:06:06.050> of<00:06:06.290> the<00:06:06.440> name<00:06:06.650> of<00:06:06.680> it<00:06:06.950> I<00:06:07.010> thought<00:06:07.280> it

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
because of the name of it I thought it

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.400

was<00:06:07.490> the<00:06:07.640> Q's<00:06:08.000> name<00:06:08.270> ever<00:06:08.480> so<00:06:08.900> the<00:06:09.020> name<00:06:09.170> of<00:06:09.320> it

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.410 
was the Q's name ever so the name of it

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.410 
was the Q's name ever so the name of it
is<00:06:09.590> and<00:06:09.800> this<00:06:10.250> little<00:06:10.520> piggy<00:06:10.790> I<00:06:11.180> don't<00:06:11.330> know

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:11.420 
is and this little piggy I don't know

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:12.850 
is and this little piggy I don't know
why<00:06:11.540> I<00:06:11.570> just<00:06:11.690> think<00:06:12.110> that's<00:06:12.290> a<00:06:12.380> really<00:06:12.620> cute

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
why I just think that's a really cute

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:13.240 
why I just think that's a really cute
name

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
name

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.100 
name
so<00:06:13.640> it's<00:06:13.760> basically<00:06:14.090> just<00:06:14.360> like<00:06:14.450> a<00:06:14.510> shimmery

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
so it's basically just like a shimmery

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.680 
so it's basically just like a shimmery
pink<00:06:15.470> nail<00:06:15.830> polish<00:06:16.040> and<00:06:16.460> it's<00:06:17.000> pretty<00:06:17.270> sheer

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
pink nail polish and it's pretty sheer

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.600 
pink nail polish and it's pretty sheer
so<00:06:17.900> I'll<00:06:18.020> probably<00:06:18.230> put<00:06:18.740> it<00:06:18.830> over<00:06:19.010> like<00:06:19.340> got<00:06:19.580> a
