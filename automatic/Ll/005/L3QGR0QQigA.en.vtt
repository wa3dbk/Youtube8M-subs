 Overall white black and yamaha colors 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.270

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.230
 this top model resp 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.180
 That is true for all three headphones 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.070
 this little remote control that is 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.140
 This earphone is officially iphone 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.570

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.680
 you can with this remote control at 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.140
 an ipod once the player control that 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.900
 means volume or sometimes one 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.670
 title before jump or if a call 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.499
 if you put the whole thing on an iphone 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.960
 then you can do with the middle one 

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:12.479
 taste the conversation accept or 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.520

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.249

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.259
 headphones with metal housing is that one 

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:23.369
 the access cable on both sides 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.780
 can be infected 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.789
 that means you can yourself 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.759
 choose how to wear the whole 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:31.229

 We have the portable use 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.920
 relatively short cable which just stops directly 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:36.990
 the player goes to the whole if you like 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.789
 home at the stereo operates there 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.139

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.119

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:43.590
 so that you stop the longer way to 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.119

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.319
