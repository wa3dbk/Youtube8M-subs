00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
32 millimeters of the rod and I think

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.730 
32 millimeters of the rod and I think
it's<00:00:25.090> um<00:00:25.830> inch<00:00:26.830> and<00:00:27.520> a<00:00:27.550> quarter<00:00:28.330> I<00:00:28.840> actually

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740 
it's um inch and a quarter I actually

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.700 
it's um inch and a quarter I actually
try<00:00:30.369> to<00:00:30.400> 38<00:00:31.119> millimeters<00:00:31.360> worn<00:00:31.990> as<00:00:32.169> well<00:00:32.410> it's

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
try to 38 millimeters worn as well it's

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.599 
try to 38 millimeters worn as well it's
like<00:00:33.129> a<00:00:33.160> one-half<00:00:33.670> inches<00:00:34.059> um<00:00:34.800> but<00:00:35.800> it's<00:00:36.159> a<00:00:36.429> bit

my face so I just clip it and try to get
the<00:02:04.750> end<00:02:05.250> inside<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.310> curl<00:02:07.210> and<00:02:08.020> I<00:02:08.500> crawl<00:02:08.860> it

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:22.710 

then<00:02:13.840> just<00:02:14.230> wait<00:02:20.490> it's<00:02:21.490> pretty<00:02:21.790> hot<00:02:22.090> so<00:02:22.420> I'm

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
then just wait it's pretty hot so I'm

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:32.880 
then just wait it's pretty hot so I'm
not<00:02:23.050> going<00:02:23.230> to<00:02:23.380> wait<00:02:24.280> too<00:02:24.520> long<00:02:28.290> so<00:02:31.590> like<00:02:32.590> this

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
not going to wait too long so like this

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:43.310 
not going to wait too long so like this
we<00:02:33.840> just<00:02:34.840> keep<00:02:35.140> going<00:02:39.630> take<00:02:40.630> like<00:02:41.019> this<00:02:41.580> and

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
we just keep going take like this and

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:51.090 
we just keep going take like this and
clip<00:02:44.320> it<00:02:45.480> try<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.540> put<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.350> end<00:02:47.620> in<00:02:48.010> size<00:02:50.100> so

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
clip it try to put the end in size so

00:02:51.100 --> 00:03:15.640 
clip it try to put the end in size so
that<00:02:51.130> it's<00:02:51.580> not<00:02:51.760> going<00:02:51.940> to<00:02:52.060> leave<00:02:52.209> a<00:02:53.940> straight

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:24.620 

think<00:03:16.650> this

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:04:01.670 

you

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:09.229 

that's<00:04:02.340> done<00:04:02.819> the<00:04:03.859> bottom<00:04:04.859> half<00:04:06.739> so<00:04:08.060> you<00:04:09.060> will

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
that's done the bottom half so you will

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.199 
that's done the bottom half so you will
know<00:04:09.480> I<00:04:09.510> just<00:04:09.750> kind<00:04:10.170> of<00:04:10.260> really<00:04:10.709> loose<00:04:10.980> curl<00:04:11.430> so

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
know I just kind of really loose curl so

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:25.180 
know I just kind of really loose curl so
I'm<00:04:12.329> going<00:04:12.420> to<00:04:12.689> finish<00:04:12.900> with<00:04:13.409> that<00:04:13.739> top<00:04:14.099> half

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:51.860 

you

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.510 

so<00:04:52.870> just<00:04:53.260> check<00:04:53.740> wherever<00:04:55.170> for<00:04:56.170> the<00:04:56.520> stray

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
so just check wherever for the stray

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.080 
so just check wherever for the stray
hair<00:04:57.820> if<00:04:58.690> you<00:04:58.900> can<00:04:59.020> spot<00:04:59.410> the<00:04:59.650> leftover<00:05:00.280> which

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
hair if you can spot the leftover which

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:10.790 
hair if you can spot the leftover which
is<00:05:01.270> come<00:05:06.150> wait<00:05:07.150> doesn't<00:05:07.420> take<00:05:08.490> long<00:05:09.490> it's<00:05:09.820> like

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
is come wait doesn't take long it's like

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:18.660 
is come wait doesn't take long it's like
10<00:05:11.800> to<00:05:12.070> 15<00:05:12.460> seconds<00:05:12.970> 8<00:05:13.540> section<00:05:15.840> so<00:05:16.840> now<00:05:17.670> it's

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:18.670 
10 to 15 seconds 8 section so now it's

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:25.350 
10 to 15 seconds 8 section so now it's
like<00:05:18.940> this<00:05:19.420> I<00:05:19.740> don't<00:05:20.740> know<00:05:20.890> if<00:05:20.980> you<00:05:21.100> can<00:05:21.280> sit<00:05:24.360> so

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
like this I don't know if you can sit so

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.160 
like this I don't know if you can sit so
it's<00:05:25.510> really<00:05:25.870> really<00:05:26.350> loose<00:05:26.860> on<00:05:27.900> after<00:05:28.900> 30

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
it's really really loose on after 30

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.050 
it's really really loose on after 30
