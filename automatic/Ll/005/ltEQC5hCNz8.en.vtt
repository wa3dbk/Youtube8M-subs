00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
maps just for the plain fact that since

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.150 
maps just for the plain fact that since
there<00:00:15.960> are<00:00:16.020> only<00:00:16.049> about<00:00:16.289> three<00:00:16.680> or<00:00:16.710> four<00:00:16.830> ways

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
there are only about three or four ways

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.460

and<00:00:17.460> get<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.820> other<00:00:17.940> side<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.510> map<00:00:18.750> it

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
and get to the other side and a map it

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.920 
and get to the other side and a map it
can<00:00:20.100> be<00:00:20.250> so<00:00:20.460> defensively<00:00:21.060> played<00:00:21.390> sometimes

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
can be so defensively played sometimes

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.950 
can be so defensively played sometimes
and<00:00:22.650> it's<00:00:23.430> just<00:00:23.670> absolute<00:00:24.029> hell<00:00:24.240> for<00:00:24.539> any<00:00:24.689> sort

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960
