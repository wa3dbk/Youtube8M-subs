so<00:01:11.290> the<00:01:11.470> main<00:01:11.590> reason<00:01:11.619> why<00:01:12.070> I<00:01:12.100> use<00:01:12.430> gel<00:01:12.820> on<00:01:13.030> this

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
so the main reason why I use gel on this

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.170 
so the main reason why I use gel on this
specific<00:01:14.050> styling<00:01:14.560> is<00:01:14.770> to<00:01:15.070> elongate<00:01:15.700> my<00:01:15.729> hair

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
specific styling is to elongate my hair

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.510 
specific styling is to elongate my hair
and<00:01:16.420> when<00:01:17.050> creating<00:01:17.320> these<00:01:17.800> curls<00:01:18.130> I<00:01:18.280> want

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
and when creating these curls I want

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.210 
and when creating these curls I want
them<00:01:18.700> to<00:01:18.729> be<00:01:18.970> preserved<00:01:19.390> for<00:01:19.659> a<00:01:19.720> few<00:01:19.930> days<00:01:20.140> if<00:01:21.070> I

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
them to be preserved for a few days if I

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.490 
them to be preserved for a few days if I
don't<00:01:21.490> do<00:01:21.700> that<00:01:21.909> it<00:01:22.060> reverts<00:01:22.420> within<00:01:22.960> two<00:01:23.290> days
