for this review so let's take a look now

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.940 
for this review so let's take a look now
I<00:00:43.660> said<00:00:43.960> before<00:00:44.140> that<00:00:44.350> the<00:00:44.590> game<00:00:44.739> is<00:00:44.920> a

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
I said before that the game is a

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.549 
I said before that the game is a
shoot-'em-up<00:00:45.399> but<00:00:45.910> really<00:00:46.300> it's<00:00:46.870> from<00:00:47.290> a<00:00:47.320> more

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
shoot-'em-up but really it's from a more

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.770 
shoot-'em-up but really it's from a more
specific<00:00:48.190> category<00:00:48.670> called<00:00:48.969> kuda<00:00:49.450> mobs

specific category called kuda mobs

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.319 
specific category called kuda mobs
similar<00:00:50.620> to<00:00:50.739> games<00:00:50.890> like<00:00:51.190> Herodias<00:00:51.820> and<00:00:52.090> twin

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
light-hearted and silly take on the

light-hearted and silly take on the
side-scrolling<00:00:56.320> shooter<00:00:57.210> but<00:00:58.210> don't<00:00:58.449> let

I'd<00:01:05.860> say<00:01:06.070> shooters<00:01:06.430> are<00:01:06.550> known<00:01:06.820> for<00:01:07.149> being

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
I'd say shooters are known for being

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.210 
I'd say shooters are known for being
hard<00:01:07.690> and<00:01:07.990> I<00:01:08.050> must<00:01:08.320> admit<00:01:08.619> that<00:01:08.649> I'm<00:01:08.860> not<00:01:08.890> very

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
hard and I must admit that I'm not very

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.490 
hard and I must admit that I'm not very
good<00:01:09.729> at<00:01:09.820> them<00:01:09.970> but<00:01:10.690> harmful<00:01:11.140> Parc<00:01:11.380> is

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
good at them but harmful Parc is

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.560 
good at them but harmful Parc is
deceptively<00:01:12.220> hard<00:01:12.520> since<00:01:12.850> it<00:01:13.000> looks<00:01:13.330> like<00:01:13.539> a

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
deceptively hard since it looks like a

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.510 
deceptively hard since it looks like a
shooter<00:01:13.960> for<00:01:14.170> kids<00:01:14.410> but<00:01:14.770> it's<00:01:14.890> actually<00:01:15.490> a

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
shooter for kids but it's actually a

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.699

another shooter staple in the form of
special<00:02:31.420> moves<00:02:31.540> but<00:02:32.230> unlike<00:02:32.560> most<00:02:32.739> shooters

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190

that just make these pickups a screen

clearing bomb or something like that
harmful<00:02:37.840> part<00:02:38.230> makes<00:02:38.500> it<00:02:38.650> so<00:02:38.860> that<00:02:38.890> the

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
harmful part makes it so that the

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.310 
harmful part makes it so that the
special<00:02:39.550> effects<00:02:40.030> are<00:02:40.330> determined<00:02:40.930> by<00:02:41.080> which

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
special effects are determined by which

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.590 
special effects are determined by which
weapon<00:02:41.739> you're<00:02:41.890> using<00:02:42.030> each<00:02:43.030> has<00:02:43.300> its<00:02:43.330> own

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
weapon you're using each has its own

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.690 
weapon you're using each has its own
pluses<00:02:44.170> and<00:02:44.320> minuses<00:02:44.769> and<00:02:45.010> using<00:02:45.370> these<00:02:45.489> at

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
pluses and minuses and using these at

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.670 
pluses and minuses and using these at
the<00:02:45.790> right<00:02:46.000> time<00:02:46.300> is<00:02:46.510> key<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:47.019> staying<00:02:47.290> alive

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
the right time is key to staying alive

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.710 
the right time is key to staying alive
so<00:02:48.550> they<00:02:48.670> are<00:02:48.820> definitely<00:02:49.570> worth

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
so they are definitely worth

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.229 
so they are definitely worth
experimenting<00:02:50.350> with<00:02:50.709> to<00:02:51.280> see<00:02:51.489> which<00:02:51.700> ones<00:02:51.970> fit

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
experimenting with to see which ones fit

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.420

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
that this game was made by people that

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.110 
that this game was made by people that
love<00:03:37.900> to<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.470> shoot-'em-ups<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.579> boxes<00:03:40.000> are

love to the shoot-'em-ups the boxes are

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.240 
love to the shoot-'em-ups the boxes are
very<00:03:40.150> strange<00:03:40.930> but<00:03:41.380> they're<00:03:41.530> also<00:03:41.739> one<00:03:42.070> of<00:03:42.100> the

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
very strange but they're also one of the

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.220 
very strange but they're also one of the
main<00:03:42.489> reasons<00:03:42.910> I<00:03:43.030> kept<00:03:43.269> playing<00:03:43.480> a<00:03:43.690> game<00:03:43.900> I

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
main reasons I kept playing a game I

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.350 
main reasons I kept playing a game I
just<00:03:44.560> wanted<00:03:45.160> to<00:03:45.280> get<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.640> each<00:03:45.820> one<00:03:46.120> to<00:03:46.150> see

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
just wanted to get to each one to see

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.620 
just wanted to get to each one to see
what<00:03:46.780> they<00:03:46.930> were<00:03:46.989> for<00:03:47.980> example<00:03:48.180> one<00:03:49.180> boss<00:03:49.390> is

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
what they were for example one boss is

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.810 
what they were for example one boss is
an<00:03:49.750> inflatable<00:03:50.200> dinosaur<00:03:50.890> while<00:03:51.400> another<00:03:51.670> is

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
an inflatable dinosaur while another is

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.699 
an inflatable dinosaur while another is
a<00:03:52.000> schoolgirls<00:03:52.600> body<00:03:52.870> from<00:03:53.170> the<00:03:53.290> shoulders

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
a schoolgirls body from the shoulders

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.920 
a schoolgirls body from the shoulders
down<00:03:53.920> and<00:03:54.220> then<00:03:54.700> they<00:03:54.820> top<00:03:55.120> all<00:03:55.390> of<00:03:55.570> that<00:03:55.720> with

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
down and then they top all of that with

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.020 
down and then they top all of that with
a<00:03:55.959> Frankenstein<00:03:56.709> robot<00:03:57.160> giving<00:03:57.790> you<00:03:57.880> the

finger while shooting a laser out of it
it's<00:04:00.519> wacky<00:04:01.120> and<00:04:01.360> strange<00:04:01.810> but<00:04:02.320> it<00:04:02.440> also<00:04:02.560> keeps

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
it's wacky and strange but it also keeps

all that said this game is relatively

all that said this game is relatively
short<00:04:08.920> if<00:04:09.220> you're<00:04:09.400> just<00:04:09.700> in<00:04:09.940> it<00:04:10.030> to<00:04:10.239> reach<00:04:10.420> the

end of the game

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.390 
end of the game
there<00:04:11.930> are<00:04:12.050> a<00:04:12.080> total<00:04:12.410> of<00:04:12.470> six<00:04:12.740> stages<00:04:13.130> and<00:04:13.280> all

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
there are a total of six stages and all

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.760 
there are a total of six stages and all
and<00:04:13.640> each<00:04:13.730> one<00:04:13.940> is<00:04:13.970> pretty<00:04:14.480> long<00:04:14.750> but<00:04:15.140> I'd<00:04:15.590> say

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
and each one is pretty long but I'd say

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.440 
and each one is pretty long but I'd say
that<00:04:15.950> the<00:04:16.070> total<00:04:16.280> clear<00:04:16.700> time<00:04:16.940> for<00:04:17.150> this<00:04:17.239> game

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
that the total clear time for this game

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.840 
that the total clear time for this game
has<00:04:17.750> to<00:04:17.930> be<00:04:18.050> somewhere<00:04:18.410> around<00:04:18.770> one<00:04:19.670> to<00:04:19.820> two

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
has to be somewhere around one to two

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.930 
has to be somewhere around one to two
hours<00:04:20.420> but<00:04:21.410> really<00:04:21.709> almost<00:04:21.980> all<00:04:22.310> shooters<00:04:22.760> are

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
hours but really almost all shooters are

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.030 
hours but really almost all shooters are
like<00:04:23.090> this<00:04:23.330> and<00:04:23.540> things<00:04:24.200> like<00:04:24.380> high<00:04:24.650> scores

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
like this and things like high scores

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.590

taken over a theme park or something and

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.540 
taken over a theme park or something and

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
tried to use it for evil yeah I don't

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.450 
tried to use it for evil yeah I don't
know<00:05:01.790> your<00:05:02.480> guess<00:05:02.660> is<00:05:02.690> as<00:05:02.840> good<00:05:02.990> as<00:05:03.140> mine

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
know your guess is as good as mine

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
know your guess is as good as mine
between<00:05:04.460> each<00:05:04.580> stage<00:05:04.850> there<00:05:05.150> are<00:05:05.210> little

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
between each stage there are little

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.510 
between each stage there are little
animated<00:05:06.050> sequences<00:05:06.530> that<00:05:06.740> help<00:05:06.920> flesh<00:05:07.280> out

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
animated sequences that help flesh out

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.580 
animated sequences that help flesh out
the<00:05:07.730> story<00:05:08.000> but<00:05:08.600> since<00:05:08.840> they're<00:05:08.990> totally<00:05:09.500> in

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
the story but since they're totally in

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.560 
the story but since they're totally in
Japanese<00:05:10.040> and<00:05:10.310> don't<00:05:10.880> seem<00:05:11.090> to<00:05:11.210> make<00:05:11.330> much

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
Japanese and don't seem to make much

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.810 
Japanese and don't seem to make much
sense<00:05:11.870> I<00:05:12.230> could<00:05:12.830> never<00:05:13.010> really<00:05:13.280> get<00:05:13.550> anything

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
sense I could never really get anything

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.420 
sense I could never really get anything
from<00:05:14.270> them<00:05:14.510> however<00:05:15.200> I<00:05:15.320> do<00:05:15.500> think<00:05:15.770> it's<00:05:16.160> pretty

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
from them however I do think it's pretty

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.310 
from them however I do think it's pretty
safe<00:05:16.640> to<00:05:16.850> say<00:05:17.060> that<00:05:17.090> shooters<00:05:17.660> don't<00:05:17.870> really

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
safe to say that shooters don't really

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.560 
safe to say that shooters don't really
rest<00:05:18.590> on<00:05:18.830> their<00:05:18.980> narrative<00:05:19.430> so<00:05:20.030> I<00:05:20.060> enjoyed<00:05:20.450> the

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
rest on their narrative so I enjoyed the

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.480 
rest on their narrative so I enjoyed the
game<00:05:20.600> quite<00:05:21.080> a<00:05:21.140> bit<00:05:21.410> despite<00:05:21.770> missing<00:05:22.220> its

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
game quite a bit despite missing its

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.450 
game quite a bit despite missing its
story<00:05:22.820> almost<00:05:23.090> completely<00:05:23.840> in<00:05:24.770> the<00:05:25.070> end<00:05:25.220> I

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
story almost completely in the end I

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.820 
story almost completely in the end I
think<00:05:25.550> harmful<00:05:26.300> Park<00:05:26.540> is<00:05:26.720> probably<00:05:27.320> the<00:05:27.590> best

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
think harmful Park is probably the best

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.310 
think harmful Park is probably the best
shooter<00:05:28.190> I've<00:05:28.370> ever<00:05:28.640> played<00:05:29.000> now<00:05:29.780> to<00:05:29.840> be<00:05:30.050> fair

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
shooter I've ever played now to be fair

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.680 
shooter I've ever played now to be fair
I<00:05:30.380> don't<00:05:30.620> play<00:05:31.010> all<00:05:31.040> that<00:05:31.340> many<00:05:31.550> of<00:05:31.730> them<00:05:31.880> but

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
I don't play all that many of them but

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.270 
I don't play all that many of them but
there<00:05:33.080> is<00:05:33.200> something<00:05:33.590> about<00:05:33.830> this<00:05:34.070> game

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
there is something about this game

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.190 
there is something about this game
that's<00:05:34.520> really<00:05:34.670> fun<00:05:35.270> even<00:05:35.540> if<00:05:35.750> you're<00:05:35.900> not<00:05:36.140> a

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
that's really fun even if you're not a

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.470 
that's really fun even if you're not a
big<00:05:36.530> shooter<00:05:36.890> fan<00:05:37.190> and<00:05:37.610> it's<00:05:37.820> hard<00:05:38.060> to<00:05:38.150> put<00:05:38.360> my

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:38.480 
big shooter fan and it's hard to put my

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.260 
big shooter fan and it's hard to put my
finger<00:05:38.840> on<00:05:38.870> what<00:05:39.230> that<00:05:39.410> x-factor<00:05:39.800> is<00:05:40.370> I<00:05:40.610> mean

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
finger on what that x-factor is I mean

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.360 
finger on what that x-factor is I mean
it<00:05:41.540> controls<00:05:42.050> like<00:05:42.260> all<00:05:42.500> good<00:05:42.710> shooters<00:05:43.160> do

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
it controls like all good shooters do

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.880 
it controls like all good shooters do
the<00:05:44.060> gameplay<00:05:44.450> in<00:05:44.570> general<00:05:45.050> is<00:05:45.200> similar<00:05:45.590> too

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:45.890 
the gameplay in general is similar too

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.710 
the gameplay in general is similar too
but<00:05:46.640> there's<00:05:46.820> just<00:05:46.880> something<00:05:47.210> about<00:05:47.420> the

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
but there's just something about the

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.390 
but there's just something about the
setting<00:05:48.140> and<00:05:48.290> the<00:05:48.350> art<00:05:48.590> that<00:05:48.710> set<00:05:49.100> this<00:05:49.220> game

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
setting and the art that set this game

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.330 
setting and the art that set this game
apart<00:05:49.820> for<00:05:50.030> me<00:05:50.180> I<00:05:50.540> had<00:05:51.290> a<00:05:51.320> really<00:05:51.830> great<00:05:52.010> time

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340
