control the front panel part of the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.350 
control the front panel part of the
computer<00:00:46.379> which<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.620> all<00:00:47.039> right<00:00:48.800> there<00:00:50.360> those

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
computer which is all right there those

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.170 
computer which is all right there those
have<00:00:51.899> been<00:00:52.050> routed<00:00:54.050> here<00:00:55.050> I'll<00:00:55.199> go<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.710> way

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
have been routed here I'll go this way

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.979 
have been routed here I'll go this way
those<00:00:57.180> have<00:00:57.420> been<00:00:57.600> routed<00:00:58.370> through<00:00:59.370> there<00:00:59.989> and

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
those have been routed through there and

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:12.370 
those have been routed through there and
through<00:01:01.710> these<00:01:05.659> little<00:01:07.760> rubber<00:01:08.760> whole<00:01:09.180> wounds

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:19.160 

and<00:01:13.729> those<00:01:14.729> routes<00:01:15.150> through<00:01:16.110> here<00:01:16.820> and<00:01:18.170> this

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
and those routes through here and this

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.740 
and those routes through here and this
is<00:01:19.560> what<00:01:19.830> controls<00:01:22.369> the<00:01:23.369> front<00:01:23.939> switches<00:01:24.509> I

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
is what controls the front switches I

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.330 
is what controls the front switches I
have<00:01:26.570> see<00:01:27.570> if<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.780> can<00:01:27.990> set<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:28.979> flashlight

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
have see if I can set this flashlight

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:39.520 
have see if I can set this flashlight
down<00:01:34.159> there<00:01:35.159> we<00:01:35.280> go<00:01:36.500> this<00:01:37.500> actually<00:01:37.850> comes<00:01:38.850> off

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
down there we go this actually comes off

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:46.370 
down there we go this actually comes off
it's<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.590> little<00:01:40.860> adapter<00:01:44.930> okay<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:45.960> don't<00:01:46.170> think

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
it's a little adapter okay I don't think

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.940 
it's a little adapter okay I don't think
it's<00:01:46.649> going<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.920> focus<00:01:47.130> very<00:01:47.549> well<00:01:48.530> but<00:01:49.530> anyway

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
it's going to focus very well but anyway

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.920 
it's going to focus very well but anyway
this<00:01:50.430> came<00:01:50.700> with<00:01:50.729> my<00:01:51.030> motherboard<00:01:51.600> it's<00:01:51.810> a

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
this came with my motherboard it's a

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.520 
this came with my motherboard it's a
little<00:01:52.200> adapter<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:53.040> it's<00:01:53.850> got<00:01:54.229> labelings<00:01:55.229> on

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
little adapter and it's got labelings on

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:02.450 
little adapter and it's got labelings on
it<00:01:55.740> on<00:01:55.920> each<00:01:56.189> side<00:01:56.549> for<00:01:58.040> things<00:01:59.040> such<00:01:59.430> as<00:02:01.460> HDD

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
it on each side for things such as HDD

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:10.390 
it on each side for things such as HDD
LED<00:02:03.180> power<00:02:03.899> ground<00:02:05.450> reset<00:02:06.450> ground<00:02:07.610> and<00:02:08.610> such

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.400 
LED power ground reset ground and such

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.750 
LED power ground reset ground and such
so<00:02:11.400> that<00:02:11.640> makes<00:02:11.909> it<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.269> lot<00:02:12.480> easier<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:14.370> plug

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
so that makes it a lot easier to plug

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:23.809 
so that makes it a lot easier to plug
that<00:02:14.790> in<00:02:16.250> I've<00:02:17.250> got<00:02:17.579> my<00:02:17.730> USB<00:02:18.599> plug<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:22.819> second

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
that in I've got my USB plug a second

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.979 
that in I've got my USB plug a second
USB<00:02:24.209> plug<00:02:24.480> if<00:02:24.629> I<00:02:24.780> needed<00:02:25.170> it<00:02:25.349> my<00:02:25.709> HDD<00:02:26.489> audio<00:02:27.000> or

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
USB plug if I needed it my HDD audio or

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:37.970 
USB plug if I needed it my HDD audio or
my<00:02:28.290> HD<00:02:28.859> audio<00:02:32.629> so<00:02:35.900> right<00:02:36.900> now<00:02:36.930> I'm<00:02:37.349> going<00:02:37.680> to

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
my HD audio so right now I'm going to

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:46.550 
my HD audio so right now I'm going to
plug<00:02:38.340> in<00:02:38.639> all<00:02:39.030> of<00:02:39.209> my<00:02:39.480> power<00:02:40.079> cables<00:02:41.359> and<00:02:45.560> data

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
plug in all of my power cables and data

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.220 
plug in all of my power cables and data
cables<00:02:47.129> to<00:02:47.519> my<00:02:47.819> motherboard<00:02:48.419> and<00:02:48.689> connect<00:02:49.109> on

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
cables to my motherboard and connect on

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.640 
cables to my motherboard and connect on
my<00:02:49.379> fan<00:02:49.650> plugs<00:02:50.189> in<00:02:50.549> and<00:02:51.139> connect<00:02:52.139> all<00:02:52.319> of<00:02:52.379> my

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
my fan plugs in and connect all of my

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.229 
my fan plugs in and connect all of my
hard<00:02:53.040> drives<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.639> optical<00:02:54.150> drives<00:02:54.590> together

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
hard drives and optical drives together

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.440 
hard drives and optical drives together
so<00:02:57.239> I'm<00:02:57.480> going<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:58.669> route<00:02:59.669> them<00:02:59.909> this<00:03:00.150> will<00:03:00.329> be

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
so I'm going to route them this will be

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.860 
so I'm going to route them this will be
kind<00:03:00.719> of<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.959> crazy<00:03:01.409> side<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:03.780> this<00:03:04.769> will<00:03:05.129> be

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
kind of the crazy side and this will be

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.509 
kind of the crazy side and this will be
the<00:03:06.870> clean<00:03:07.169> side<00:03:07.590> because<00:03:07.950> this<00:03:08.099> will<00:03:08.250> be<00:03:08.370> the

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
the clean side because this will be the

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:14.930 
the clean side because this will be the
side<00:03:08.760> that<00:03:08.790> has<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:12.560> glass<00:03:13.560> mirror<00:03:14.010> are<00:03:14.729> not

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
side that has the glass mirror are not

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.250 
side that has the glass mirror are not
mere<00:03:15.269> but<00:03:15.479> the<00:03:16.440> part<00:03:16.680> that<00:03:16.799> you<00:03:16.889> can<00:03:17.040> see<00:03:17.280> so

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
mere but the part that you can see so

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.610 
mere but the part that you can see so
let's<00:03:19.260> begin<00:03:19.590> with<00:03:19.829> that<00:03:20.659> also<00:03:21.659> for<00:03:22.019> this<00:03:22.260> part

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
let's begin with that also for this part

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.020 
let's begin with that also for this part
of<00:03:22.859> the<00:03:22.979> build<00:03:23.190> you're<00:03:23.459> going<00:03:23.609> to<00:03:23.699> want<00:03:23.849> to

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
of the build you're going to want to

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.640 
of the build you're going to want to
have<00:03:24.269> your<00:03:24.599> motherboard<00:03:25.319> user<00:03:25.620> guide<00:03:25.979> handy

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
have your motherboard user guide handy

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.219 
have your motherboard user guide handy
to<00:03:28.650> know<00:03:30.439> the<00:03:31.439> layout<00:03:31.709> of<00:03:32.159> your<00:03:32.280> motherboard

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:33.229 
to know the layout of your motherboard

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:39.429 
to know the layout of your motherboard
so<00:03:34.229> you<00:03:34.319> don't<00:03:34.620> plug<00:03:34.979> in<00:03:35.220> any<00:03:36.229> raw<00:03:37.579> sockets

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:39.439 
so you don't plug in any raw sockets

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:43.849 
so you don't plug in any raw sockets
because<00:03:40.439> that<00:03:40.680> would<00:03:40.859> be<00:03:41.250> very<00:03:42.120> bad<00:03:42.299> and<00:03:42.959> you

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
because that would be very bad and you

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:45.170 
because that would be very bad and you
could<00:03:44.040> cause<00:03:44.340> some<00:03:44.639> damage<00:03:44.669> to<00:03:45.120> your

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
could cause some damage to your

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.869 
could cause some damage to your
motherboard<00:03:45.799> also<00:03:46.799> i'm<00:03:47.009> not<00:03:47.310> going<00:03:47.549> to<00:03:47.669> plug

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
motherboard also i'm not going to plug

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.270 
motherboard also i'm not going to plug
in<00:03:48.090> my<00:03:48.659> graphics<00:03:49.139> card<00:03:49.259> yet<00:03:49.829> to<00:03:50.099> the

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280
