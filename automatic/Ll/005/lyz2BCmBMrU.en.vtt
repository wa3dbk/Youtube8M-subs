00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
so do you want to build something with

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:03.560 
so do you want to build something with
perfect<00:00:02.520> matted<00:00:02.909> corners

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
perfect matted corners

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:19.120 
perfect matted corners
check<00:00:03.959> out<00:00:04.170> these<00:00:04.370> 45-degree<00:00:05.370> cross<00:00:05.670> cut<00:00:05.879> sled

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.500 

the<00:00:20.130> first<00:00:20.400> thing<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.730> do<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.270> get<00:00:21.449> some

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
the first thing to do is to get some

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.349 
the first thing to do is to get some
hardware<00:00:22.080> for<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.529> runners<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.130> found<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.210> small

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
hardware for the runners I found a small

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.540 
hardware for the runners I found a small
beach<00:00:24.689> board<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.320> use<00:00:25.470> my<00:00:25.740> shop<00:00:26.039> made<00:00:26.279> band

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
beach board and use my shop made band

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:36.900 
beach board and use my shop made band
jointer<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.150> square<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.599> up

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.030 

at<00:00:37.910> the<00:00:38.090> table<00:00:38.450> saw<00:00:38.660> I<00:00:38.899> get<00:00:39.230> two<00:00:39.350> slices<00:00:39.620> with

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
at the table saw I get two slices with

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.189 
at the table saw I get two slices with
smaller<00:00:40.399> thicknesses<00:00:41.149> than<00:00:41.420> without<00:00:42.020> the

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
smaller thicknesses than without the

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:49.520 
smaller thicknesses than without the
slots

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.260 

the<00:00:50.530> width<00:00:50.740> of<00:00:50.920> God<00:00:51.160> was<00:00:51.490> a<00:00:51.520> bit<00:00:51.820> bigger<00:00:52.120> than

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
the width of God was a bit bigger than

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.080 
the width of God was a bit bigger than
the<00:00:52.600> real<00:00:52.990> slot<00:00:53.380> measure<00:00:53.770> so<00:00:54.460> I<00:00:54.490> can<00:00:54.760> fine-tune

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
the real slot measure so I can fine-tune

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:04.150 
the real slot measure so I can fine-tune
it<00:00:55.480> later

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.070 

Here<00:01:05.160> I<00:01:05.220> am<00:01:05.370> searching<00:01:05.820> for<00:01:06.030> higher<00:01:06.480> points

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
Here I am searching for higher points

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.840 
Here I am searching for higher points
and<00:01:07.260> removing<00:01:07.710> them<00:01:07.920> with<00:01:08.190> a<00:01:08.220> block<00:01:08.520> plan

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
and removing them with a block plan

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:19.030 
and removing them with a block plan
until<00:01:09.300> the<00:01:09.480> runners<00:01:09.810> fit<00:01:10.050> perfectly

with the sled base during the glue up

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:57.830 
with the sled base during the glue up
I<00:02:55.310> apply<00:02:56.310> some<00:02:56.340> clamping<00:02:57.090> pressure<00:02:57.120> and

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
I apply some clamping pressure and

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:06.130 
I apply some clamping pressure and
waited<00:02:58.770> for<00:02:58.950> some<00:02:59.370> magic<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.850> happen

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.750 

the<00:03:07.140> runners<00:03:07.530> would<00:03:07.740> cut<00:03:07.980> flesh<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.460> the<00:03:08.550> base

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
the runners would cut flesh to the base

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.910 
the runners would cut flesh to the base
and<00:03:09.120> you<00:03:09.330> may<00:03:09.510> want<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:09.810> reinforce<00:03:10.170> with<00:03:10.800> the

and you may want to reinforce with the

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:33.619 
and you may want to reinforce with the
fuse<00:03:11.160> first

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:38.399 

it<00:03:34.629> was<00:03:34.810> time<00:03:35.079> to<00:03:35.260> make<00:03:35.409> the<00:03:35.560> fences<00:03:36.099> I<00:03:37.200> use<00:03:38.200> the

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:38.409 
it was time to make the fences I use the

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:40.979 
it was time to make the fences I use the
MDF<00:03:38.890> scrap<00:03:39.280> that<00:03:39.489> I<00:03:39.519> could<00:03:39.849> in<00:03:39.970> half<00:03:40.239> and<00:03:40.569> clean

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
MDF scrap that I could in half and clean

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:56.330 
MDF scrap that I could in half and clean
up<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.319> edges

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.040 

for<00:03:57.340> cross-cutting<00:03:57.910> I<00:03:58.240> just<00:03:58.660> used<00:03:58.870> the

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
for cross-cutting I just used the

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.170 
for cross-cutting I just used the
mortgage<00:03:59.620> and<00:03:59.920> draw<00:04:00.160> a<00:04:00.190> pencil<00:04:00.460> lining<00:04:01.060> the

fences with a 45 degree chamfer and bit

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:23.150 
fences with a 45 degree chamfer and bit
so<00:04:13.510> it<00:04:13.720> gets<00:04:13.960> more<00:04:14.170> comfortable<00:04:14.500> to<00:04:14.980> the<00:04:15.100> touch

the<00:04:24.160> back<00:04:24.400> fence<00:04:24.730> was<00:04:25.000> glued<00:04:25.330> directly

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
the back fence was glued directly

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:35.310 
the back fence was glued directly
because<00:04:26.200> it<00:04:26.680> doesn't<00:04:26.980> need<00:04:27.100> calibration<00:04:34.320> with

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
because it doesn't need calibration with

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.740 
because it doesn't need calibration with
the<00:04:35.440> blade<00:04:35.710> at<00:04:35.890> 45<00:04:36.430> degree<00:04:36.820> angle<00:04:37.240> the<00:04:37.540> kerf

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
the blade at 45 degree angle the kerf

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.080 
the blade at 45 degree angle the kerf
was<00:04:37.990> extended<00:04:38.650> almost<00:04:39.040> until<00:04:39.400> the<00:04:39.550> end<00:04:39.700> of<00:04:39.880> the

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
was extended almost until the end of the

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.430 
was extended almost until the end of the
slab<00:04:40.360> base<00:04:42.270> attach<00:04:43.270> the<00:04:43.540> other<00:04:43.690> fence<00:04:44.110> with

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
slab base attach the other fence with

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.260 
slab base attach the other fence with
just<00:04:44.680> one<00:04:44.950> screw<00:04:45.370> and<00:04:45.610> make<00:04:45.910> all<00:04:46.120> the

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
just one screw and make all the

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.240 
just one screw and make all the
adjustments<00:04:46.870> needed<00:04:47.140> so<00:04:47.710> you<00:04:47.830> can<00:04:48.040> get<00:04:48.220> a

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
adjustments needed so you can get a

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.220 
adjustments needed so you can get a
square<00:04:48.640> angle<00:04:48.850> between<00:04:49.180> the<00:04:49.540> fence<00:04:49.840> and<00:04:50.050> the

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
square angle between the fence and the

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.950 
square angle between the fence and the
curve<00:04:50.830> I<00:04:51.070> decided<00:04:51.790> to<00:04:52.000> throw<00:04:52.180> up<00:04:52.420> some<00:04:52.630> color

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
curve I decided to throw up some color

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.320 
curve I decided to throw up some color
to<00:04:53.110> clearly<00:04:53.920> see<00:04:54.100> the<00:04:54.250> surface<00:04:54.700> line<00:04:54.970> made<00:04:55.300> by
