00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
shack launcher hit the troops the troops

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.900 
shack launcher hit the troops the troops
would<00:02:20.370> go<00:02:20.580> back<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:25.370> original<00:02:26.370> flayer

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
would go back to the original flayer

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.400 
would go back to the original flayer
after<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:28.130> shock<00:02:29.130> wore<00:02:29.400> off<00:02:29.459> on<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.599> so<00:02:31.110> they

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
after the shock wore off on that so they

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.150 
after the shock wore off on that so they
actually<00:02:31.650> had<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.160> do<00:02:32.340> a<00:02:33.110> client<00:02:34.110> update<00:02:34.590> for

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
actually had to do a client update for

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.410 
actually had to do a client update for
that<00:02:36.060> fix<00:02:37.250> so<00:02:38.250> that's<00:02:38.459> why<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:38.700> got<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.030> quick

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
that fix so that's why you got a quick

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.190
