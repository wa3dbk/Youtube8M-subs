what<00:00:19.140> do<00:00:19.199> you<00:00:19.260> think<00:00:19.439> airplanes<00:00:19.830> are<00:00:19.949> gonna

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
what do you think airplanes are gonna

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.849 
what do you think airplanes are gonna
look<00:00:20.310> like<00:00:20.369> in<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.789> future<00:00:20.960> one<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.410> will

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
look like in the future one you will

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.670 
look like in the future one you will
have<00:00:23.660> Rockets<00:00:24.660> on<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.990> on<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.380> wings<00:00:27.410> so<00:00:28.410> the

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
have Rockets on it on the wings so the

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.230 
have Rockets on it on the wings so the
people<00:00:28.980> there<00:00:29.189> don't<00:00:29.490> have<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.730> wait<00:00:29.910> they

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
people there don't have to wait they

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.089 
people there don't have to wait they
could<00:00:30.420> just<00:00:30.599> get<00:00:30.779> on<00:00:30.929> there<00:00:31.109> playing<00:00:31.410> beat

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
could just get on there playing beat

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.170 
could just get on there playing beat
drums<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:33.440> we<00:00:34.440> don't<00:00:34.590> see<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:35.340> airplanes<00:00:35.910> are

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
drums it we don't see that airplanes are

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.450 
drums it we don't see that airplanes are
going<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.510> be<00:00:36.630> getting<00:00:37.170> much<00:00:37.440> bigger<00:00:37.680> but<00:00:38.309> we

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
going to be getting much bigger but we

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.090 
going to be getting much bigger but we
are<00:00:38.610> studying<00:00:39.440> configurations<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.649> are

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
are studying configurations that are

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.639 
are studying configurations that are
called<00:00:41.370> blended<00:00:41.820> wing<00:00:42.030> bodies<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:43.320> airplane

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
called blended wing bodies the airplane

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.770 
called blended wing bodies the airplane
might<00:00:43.860> be<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.070> hundred<00:00:44.340> feet<00:00:44.730> wide<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.539> maybe

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
might be a hundred feet wide and maybe

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.139 
might be a hundred feet wide and maybe
sixty<00:00:46.530> or<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.950> hundred<00:00:47.010> feet<00:00:47.430> front<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.969> back

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
sixty or a hundred feet front to back

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.970 
sixty or a hundred feet front to back
this<00:00:48.510> would<00:00:48.660> be<00:00:48.780> like<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.960> big<00:00:49.230> movie<00:00:49.559> theater

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
this would be like a big movie theater

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.209 
this would be like a big movie theater

add three more batteries please you need

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.850 
add three more batteries please you need
apple<00:01:15.000> juice<00:01:15.299> how<00:01:15.960> many<00:01:16.170> apples<00:01:16.560> would<00:01:16.740> it

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
apple juice how many apples would it

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.969 
apple juice how many apples would it
take<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.100> power<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.549> plan<00:01:17.939> ah

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
take to power a plan ah

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.890 
take to power a plan ah
25<00:01:19.979> million<00:01:20.369> where<00:01:21.210> would<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.450> get<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.720> many

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
25 million where would you get that many

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.070 
25 million where would you get that many
apples<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.250> use<00:01:23.460> ask<00:01:23.790> everyone<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.509> fan<00:01:24.840> an

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
apples you can use ask everyone a fan an

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.370 
apples you can use ask everyone a fan an
average<00:01:25.759> for<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.850> apple<00:01:27.180> juice<00:01:27.360> idea<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.200> can

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
average for the apple juice idea you can

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.010 
average for the apple juice idea you can
actually<00:01:28.560> take<00:01:28.979> any<00:01:29.280> biomass<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.360> turn<00:01:30.900> it

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
actually take any biomass and turn it

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.499 
actually take any biomass and turn it
into<00:01:31.170> jet<00:01:31.530> fuel<00:01:31.860> interesting<00:01:32.670> enough<00:01:32.970> one<00:01:33.479> of

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
into jet fuel interesting enough one of

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.749 
into jet fuel interesting enough one of
the<00:01:33.600> best<00:01:33.750> sources<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.259> algae<00:01:34.740> certain<00:01:35.520> types

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
the best sources is algae certain types

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.270 
the best sources is algae certain types
of<00:01:35.880> algae<00:01:36.060> produce<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:37.049> lot<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.530> energy<00:01:37.920> per

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
of algae produce a lot of energy per

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.190 
of algae produce a lot of energy per
pound<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.939> obviously<00:01:39.659> people<00:01:39.840> don't<00:01:39.960> eat

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
pound and obviously people don't eat

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.660 
pound and obviously people don't eat
algae<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:40.619> it's<00:01:40.799> not<00:01:40.890> competing<00:01:41.340> with<00:01:41.460> food

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
algae so it's not competing with food

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.340 
algae so it's not competing with food
production<00:01:41.880> for<00:01:42.210> people

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
production for people

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.040 
production for people
the<00:01:45.350> rocket<00:01:46.220> oh<00:01:46.250> it's<00:01:46.790> an<00:01:47.030> airplane<00:01:47.480> that<00:01:47.600> goes

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
the rocket oh it's an airplane that goes

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.150 
the rocket oh it's an airplane that goes
in<00:01:48.350> space<00:01:48.740> no<00:01:49.700> I<00:01:49.810> don't<00:01:50.810> think<00:01:50.870> so<00:01:51.230> they<00:01:52.010> don't

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
in space no I don't think so they don't

00:01:52.160 --> 00:02:00.790 
in space no I don't think so they don't
have<00:01:52.340> enough<00:01:52.670> apples<00:01:54.490> no<00:01:55.490> idea<00:01:55.970> a<00:01:58.960> big<00:01:59.960> bologna

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
have enough apples no idea a big bologna

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.580 
have enough apples no idea a big bologna
