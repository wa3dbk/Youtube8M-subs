00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.240
 hello we find ourselves for a very 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:09.940
 short video show you the effectiveness 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:13.209
 of greasy wood so the greasy wood actually 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:16.090
 it's going to be a piece of softwood that has 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:17.380
 been cut and then the sap continue 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.750
 to ride only he can not anymore 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.820
 get out by the other end of the shot in 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.890
 does all the sap and resin are going to get 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.330
 store if the sphere of the greasy wood that 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.550
 so can this color of 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.869
 colors a little more reddish so I 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.030
 am going to make some small chips here 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.680
 the planted in the earth the lit you 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.030
 show how good these girls are I 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.699
 came using the realized knife 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.809
 some coarse chips and with the 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:40.510
 weekend it also works with 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.760
 matches or the falher cl it's going to take 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.780
 directly 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.159
 we can see that the black smoke that 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.829
 clear in fact it's the resin that 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:50.710
 come collect so here is 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.260
 done without special effects it's really 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.030
 effective 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.010
 it's going to be very long for you so it's okay 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.260
 allow us to turn on the lights more 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.260
 easily when for example 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.920
 everything is wet since the resin does not 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
 not afraid of water 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.760
 so suddenly we can very well take 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.810
 my little bit of foie gras and keep it 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.070
 even if it rains, it will work here 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.110
 will come to take the pulse to see 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.280
 behind even though the most group have 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.280
 really a formidable efficiency 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.460
 fox is gone on a piece of this 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.070
 size we can even take it imagine 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.729
 use torches if that's okay 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.700
 withstand even a small wind really have 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.770
 very useful very effective so that we can 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.750
 find on two pieces of resin 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.570
 as we have seen they have already been 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.190
 cut but can be found in all 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.060
 seasons in fact just by the way of 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.890
 find them in small pieces of wood 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.479
 thanks to walk because there are many 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.369
 people who think but it works 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.450
 in the spring and it's spring or 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.770
 a big rise of sap 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.380
 so that's where it comes to accumulate 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.479
 but then we can very well 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.060
 piece in winter where anytime that 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.690
 will always walk 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.619
 I even have a super pretty strongly 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.899
 in fact it's a little bit like a 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.800
 birthday candle that will be him so 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.720
 even with slow it remains effective 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.640
 so we can easily see that the fire 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.840
 for a very long time 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.940
 which leaves us ample time to 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.630
 come and prepare the rest or add 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.310
 wood to throw a good so here 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.530
 it was the log that I had 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.030
 I found in the creek 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.110
 we can easily imagine ourselves 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.540
 constitute very small branches 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.280
 like that or even smaller than we 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.230
 can keep on oneself in his bag 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.570
 and even people who use it 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.640
 to make fire style handles that 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.260
 come scrape or so we will come 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.000
 title person or use it as a 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.930
 keychain or anything so 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.780
 knowing that there for the demonstration 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.190
 himself manages a big piece but that he 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.549
 just make some small chips 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.610
 to come and start a fire so with that one 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:59.190
 can already started a lot of fire if we are 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.630
 just scratched so either by doing some 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.459
 little facts around 6 years coming 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.959
 the blade on it rubbing to clear 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.530
 very little bit to be able to 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.299
 all at the base alongside the flames of 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.600
 the well-burned resin really smells 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.340
 very good it's really really very 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.720
 effective 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.220
 here it was a really very video 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.500
 fast and improvised as I fell 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.120
 on this piece of angus hoping 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.120
 that you and more thanks to see you soon
