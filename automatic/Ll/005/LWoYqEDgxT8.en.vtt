00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.870
 in the picture and now I want to share with 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.990

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:16.390
 this impression these shoes 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.400
 The first shoes that I have 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.830
 emerged from such normal workers 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.679
 were jumbo 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.820
 Well, perhaps I clarified one review to my 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:27.630
 can install separately 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:31.079
 there is not talking about them in detail 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.490
 after genres i bought shoes 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:36.070
 Polish company arrived they seem here 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.770
 on these top came another and 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.120
 manufacturer of some other shoes 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.240
 Polish company pro x3 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:49.180
 I had them for about a year and a half 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:51.340
 I wore them very much in the spring around 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.620
 three months after that in one of them from 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.020
 edge to the edge of the window came up there for 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.670
 beauty were inclusions screwdrivers 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.230
 because of this scientific and after that i 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.290
 worth the boots in the ground they are there 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:05.050
 lying around and I have not used anymore 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:09.750
 and do not use the following now 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:12.160
 I bought here these here, they work boots 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.030
 sample of someone else soviet 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:19.450
 that is, the first birds in these boots and 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.060
 then I bought a size larger than my 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.800
 well you never know what is there to footcloth 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.810
 problem books you fit to wear no help 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.140
 was guided because they were 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.159
 bought by me a little more after that they 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.380
 stretched out 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.050
 for two years, that is, I worked for them 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.840
 bought them because if the works of two 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.040
 homes or break free to appearance 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.020
 very spoiled 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.659
 I decided to buy for work special 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.610
 individual work boots I'm in them 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.350
 worked for about two years after that 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.090
 did not become very big move you with him 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.000
 a foot larger than him they are cool 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.520
 by me they were slightly modified then 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.369
 have legs after a year did not finally can not 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.360
 get wet with the moment of literally any race 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.979
 I swept them all with paraffin 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.500
 how do i shoot a separate video they 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.630
 all became almost waterproof ie 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.950
 through holes holes water with wild and and 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:14.150
 through the sole but 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.920
 at the same time from above the growth of him water you pass 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.110
 take tell me what to work i don't 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.660
 really liked them because they are rude 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.480
 came up if something was digging with a shovel 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.200
 walk a couple someone there stone still 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.019
 for some reason 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:31.610
 that is tough on the scroll this good 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:33.050
 fits so certain they are pretty strong 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.049
 By yuzany reset this than here 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:39.799
 riveting came off here strings came off 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:41.360
 you can pour shove but in principle they 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:46.760
 retained their appearance and they still 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.810
 can work next when in brix 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.819
 he approached a lot 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.980
 about here and four ago said 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.230
 approximately because I don’t remember exactly 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.269
 quite a lot of time passed I bought 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.170
 here are these boots from the company grinders that is 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.290
 some on came up 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.569
 written govinda and the form can be found 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.670
 on the strap that is these shoes 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.280
 bought in Minsk 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.940
 but it is an English company and made by him 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.069
 I mean, I’m already wearing these shoes 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.920
 four years that is how much to lead them 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:18.470
 the appearance is very good i'm not in them 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.260
 I work I do not go only to work all 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.420
 8 well for about three months that is 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.840
 the soles of them are dirty to him it is whole and 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.700
 on the heels of a thousand wear but of us as it were in 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.760
 this place does not come and he is about 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.560
 millimeter 3 fit very high quality 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.880
 I think that I have another turn of years 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.549
 may be enough 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.290
 that is, there may be someone there 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:42.739
 fell thanks here me a whole more on 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:47.209
 at the same time, what do i like about them 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:49.220
 They are very soft skin very cool 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.650
 shoes will be very satisfied will wear them 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.930
 the next shoes were bought on 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.329
 the change of such workers is boots 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:00.799
 seamaster tees bought last 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:03.799
 in the spring if I'm not mistaken in them 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:06.889
 worked well and it will offer you good luck 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.950
 so far for something to work there 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:09.940
 setting some kind of brick and cement 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.890
 so that the legs remain 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.319
 safety ie skin pretty 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:19.840
 tough it protects but also came 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:23.080
 pretty solid bought for 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:27.240
 to work good shoes 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.240
 went prikopana just will not come off 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.180
 lied a little bit before that 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.910
 bought 80 mm and garsing 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:40.090
 then the model will show that it is well sign 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.320
 Now I do not know these shoes I bought for 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.690
 order to see what they are 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.060
 different they were with horse riding then 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:51.250
 Now you need those articles for something that is 8 with 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:54.100
 leather fabric topped honest 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.240
 I will say the first difference they are easier that is 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.260
 they are easier to support 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:01.300
 Well, I do not know the forest I do not have time I 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.889
 I will try then never to do a review 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.229
 on each base do not find to carry weigh 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:08.340
 them but they are also not against the flesh and easier 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:10.750
 something to me in itself 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.510
 temperature somehow the limit is shifted even 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:16.840
 of these grinders I like when I go 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.430
 temperature there from + 5 to -20 that is 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.530
 I have enough and despite more here 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.530
 only one of their leatherette finally 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:26.650
 I go about these from plus 15 to plus 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.320
 5 that is, spring 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:33.789
 More precisely summer almost not wear Sydney in the fall 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:35.229
 our winter pronounced tales also 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:36.030
 last spring were bought in the test 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:39.460
 mending 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:42.120
 there between say the courses I bought about 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:46.180
 for 30 dollars that is then it was 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:49.930
 Something about 250 thousand Belarusian 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:52.229
 rubles I bought them why because these 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:56.500
 already completely lost glory to them 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:58.539
 wear somewhere to work and have these 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.780
 used rotor rotary method 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:03.430
 mounting soles ie here is not life 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.070
 applied glue it came by me method 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:09.250
 shoulders 3 swap this rotary meter 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:12.340
 there when to be one review there are such 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.690
 rubber slaps which keeps wanted 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.370
 try this cop them like them yourself 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:19.660
 will show that is 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:22.900
 accounting for my feelings water when here 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.580
 its why this one with time when long 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.770
 their wear came walking away here and 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.139
 begin to pass water then this method 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.990
 more reliable well of course I still go a little 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:35.020
 I wear so I can not say exactly 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:37.870
 I have if for the winter these boots 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:40.449
 I have boots for spring now 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:42.250
 work boots and latest base 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:45.910
 which is here these here last fall 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:48.669
 pool system also garsing model 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.590
 called for 105 boots i bought it 

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:53.530
 only for running I will say why because 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:57.340
 i like to run around with dogs support well 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:59.380
 Here I like it, that is, and the last 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:02.050
 time began to hurt my knees and but I decided 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:04.210
 that is softer to take on 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:06.370
 the woods have to buy a Visit 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.930
 that is, in these and in these boots 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:11.320
 applied the same approached 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:13.690
 approached called randr simple and 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:17.320
 transparent english it came up 

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:20.380
 done like a little bit of a colorful 

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:23.289
 tougher than the card but compared to 

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:26.039
 these anarchy blue shoes because 

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:29.200
 that it absorbs and not so much 

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:31.030
 colleagues are killed while running ie it is 

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.870
 It was the criterion why and thieves precisely if 

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.669
 visit lunch 

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:35.860
 besides, the second criterion they should 

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:38.260
 to be completely skin that we have them 

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:42.039
 can be distinguished throughout the year including winter 

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:44.169
 degrees so to -20 and the third criterion 

00:07:42.039 --> 00:07:49.090
 there is the highest possible drawing paper that is 

00:07:44.169 --> 00:07:51.090
 for that moment and then take this 60 

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:53.710
 dollars 

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:55.960
 about 500 thousand Belarusian rubles and 

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:57.910
 it was almost not suitable for 

00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:01.810
 all her criteria are equally the sole 

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:03.669
 runner they were leather there is the maximum 

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:06.400
 high in the pan that is how visible 

00:08:03.669 --> 00:08:09.490
 from the top 10 centimeters maximum 

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.349
 my advice folds this story 

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.070
 such shoes I suck for example 

00:08:11.349 --> 00:08:15.240
 property 

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:15.240
 Thank you for watching
