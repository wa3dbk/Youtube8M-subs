you why it gives you a peace of mind
about<00:00:14.670> your<00:00:14.940> tires<00:00:15.210> while<00:00:15.690> you're<00:00:15.870> driving

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:16.349 
about your tires while you're driving

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.189 
about your tires while you're driving
let's<00:00:16.800> take<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:17.010> look<00:00:17.420> the<00:00:18.420> kid<00:00:18.659> has<00:00:18.839> everything

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
let's take a look the kid has everything

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.800 
let's take a look the kid has everything
you<00:00:19.470> need<00:00:19.499> to<00:00:19.710> hook<00:00:19.949> up<00:00:20.130> your<00:00:20.159> system<00:00:20.759> first<00:00:21.630> of

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
you need to hook up your system first of

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.040 
you need to hook up your system first of
all<00:00:21.929> I<00:00:21.989> wired<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.650> into<00:00:23.070> my<00:00:23.220> 12-volt<00:00:23.789> system

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
all I wired it into my 12-volt system

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.079 
all I wired it into my 12-volt system
then<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.259> put<00:00:25.499> the<00:00:25.589> receiver<00:00:26.009> underneath<00:00:26.789> the

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:27.089 
then I put the receiver underneath the

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.229 
then I put the receiver underneath the
dashboard<00:00:27.890> mount<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:29.159> the<00:00:29.249> antenna<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:30.210> an

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:30.239 
dashboard mount that the antenna to an

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.690 
dashboard mount that the antenna to an
external<00:00:30.749> location<00:00:31.199> here<00:00:31.829> under<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.279> propane

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
external location here under the propane

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.470 
external location here under the propane
tank<00:00:33.170> then<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.290> mounted<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.769> sensors<00:00:35.519> onto<00:00:36.359> the

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
tank then I mounted the sensors onto the

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.959 
tank then I mounted the sensors onto the
valve<00:00:36.660> stems<00:00:37.079> for<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.070> Dooleys<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:38.579> used<00:00:38.820> a

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
valve stems for the Dooleys I used a

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.549 
valve stems for the Dooleys I used a
trachea<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.600> comes<00:00:39.809> with<00:00:40.019> the<00:00:40.109> kit<00:00:40.320> and

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
trachea that comes with the kit and

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.130 
trachea that comes with the kit and
mounted<00:00:41.399> them<00:00:41.519> onto<00:00:41.910> my<00:00:41.940> dually<00:00:42.359> tires<00:00:42.660> now

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
mounted them onto my dually tires now

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.319 
mounted them onto my dually tires now
they're<00:00:43.379> sending<00:00:43.800> signals<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.879> receiver

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
they're sending signals to the receiver

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.299 
they're sending signals to the receiver
unit<00:00:45.629> i<00:00:45.929> mounted<00:00:46.440> my<00:00:46.500> tire<00:00:46.949> pressure

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
unit i mounted my tire pressure

my backup camera so I can see it while
I'm<00:00:52.649> driving<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.789> gives<00:00:54.059> me<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.239> readout<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.749> all

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140

the tire pressures and temperatures that

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.439 
the tire pressures and temperatures that
way<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.769> know<00:00:58.949> for<00:00:59.309> sure<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.579> everything<00:01:00.359> is

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
way I know for sure that everything is

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.660 
way I know for sure that everything is
running<00:01:00.690> properly<00:01:00.960> while<00:01:01.800> we're<00:01:02.010> moving<00:01:02.489> down

an<00:01:12.000> over<00:01:12.300> inflation<00:01:12.720> warning<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.530> looked<00:01:13.980> like

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
an over inflation warning it looked like

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.900 
an over inflation warning it looked like
this<00:01:15.560> so<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.590> pulled<00:01:16.920> over<00:01:17.040> at<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.400> next<00:01:17.670> rest

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
this so I pulled over at the next rest

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.570 
this so I pulled over at the next rest
stop<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.810> let<00:01:18.990> out<00:01:19.140> some<00:01:19.350> air<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.800> continued

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
on my way the system will also tell you

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.070 
on my way the system will also tell you
if<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.780> have<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.960> low<00:01:25.200> pressure<00:01:25.440> condition

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080
