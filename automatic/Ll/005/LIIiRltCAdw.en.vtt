00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
can rise well it's not that bad no can

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.000

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:54.969 
that's transparent classic color so it's

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:58.770 
that's transparent classic color so it's
good<00:02:55.359> maps<00:02:56.049> and<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:57.700> bag<00:02:57.909> that<00:02:58.150> goes<00:02:58.209> over<00:02:58.569> the
