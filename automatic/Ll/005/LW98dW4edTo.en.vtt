than the texture packs i usually use

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.089 
than the texture packs i usually use
this<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:12.929> like<00:00:13.139> vanilla<00:00:13.440> minecraft<00:00:13.590> in<00:00:14.070> the

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
this is like vanilla minecraft in the

this is like vanilla minecraft in the
way<00:00:14.280> that<00:00:14.490> it<00:00:14.639> has<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:14.820> 16<00:00:15.330> by<00:00:15.450> 16<00:00:15.509> texture<00:00:16.230> pack

way that it has a 16 by 16 texture pack
which<00:00:16.650> i'm<00:00:16.859> usually<00:00:17.130> not<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.430> big<00:00:17.640> fan<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:17.880> but<00:00:18.539> i

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
which i'm usually not a big fan of but i

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.810 
which i'm usually not a big fan of but i
think<00:00:18.960> this<00:00:19.050> pack<00:00:19.289> looks<00:00:19.650> pretty<00:00:19.890> nice<00:00:20.070> so

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
think this pack looks pretty nice so

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.330 
think this pack looks pretty nice so
first<00:00:21.660> off<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.260> swords<00:00:22.710> if<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.070> look<00:00:23.220> at

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
first off the swords if you look at

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.460 
first off the swords if you look at
every<00:00:23.580> single<00:00:23.760> sword<00:00:24.090> through<00:00:24.750> all<00:00:24.930> just<00:00:25.380> a

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
every single sword through all just a

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.689 
every single sword through all just a
little<00:00:25.800> bit<00:00:25.920> different<00:00:26.279> from<00:00:26.369> each<00:00:26.550> other

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
little bit different from each other

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.220 
little bit different from each other
which<00:00:27.000> i<00:00:27.180> think<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.449> cool<00:00:27.660> because<00:00:27.840> like<00:00:28.109> the

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
which i think is cool because like the

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.839 
which i think is cool because like the
wood<00:00:28.380> swords<00:00:28.710> little<00:00:28.859> bit<00:00:28.949> fatter<00:00:29.189> the

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
wood swords little bit fatter the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.910 
wood swords little bit fatter the
diamond<00:00:30.630> sword<00:00:30.900> has<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.170> downward<00:00:31.679> pointing

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
diamond sword has a downward pointing

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.430 
diamond sword has a downward pointing
handle<00:00:32.489> iron<00:00:33.120> has<00:00:33.300> an<00:00:33.420> upwards<00:00:33.780> all<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.260> kind

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
handle iron has an upwards all that kind

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.810 
handle iron has an upwards all that kind
of<00:00:34.500> stuff<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.920> i<00:00:35.250> thought<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.460> was<00:00:35.579> really

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
of stuff and i thought that was really

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.630 
of stuff and i thought that was really
cool<00:00:36.050> also<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.200> axes<00:00:37.710> are<00:00:37.920> all<00:00:38.129> different<00:00:38.309> too

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
cool also the axes are all different too

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.979 
cool also the axes are all different too
so<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:38.969> can<00:00:39.090> see<00:00:39.210> like<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.450> diamond<00:00:39.809> does<00:00:39.960> a

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
so you can see like the diamond does a

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.799 
so you can see like the diamond does a
double<00:00:40.200> sided<00:00:40.559> x<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.430> gold<00:00:41.730> has<00:00:42.059> an<00:00:42.360> ax<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.629> the

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
double sided x the gold has an ax to the

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.049 
double sided x the gold has an ax to the
point<00:00:43.020> on<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.230> back<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.680> then<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.370> Ironwood

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
point on the back and then the Ironwood

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.700 
point on the back and then the Ironwood
are<00:00:45.300> kind<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.660> close<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.050> same<00:00:46.260> but<00:00:46.530> they're<00:00:46.649> a

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
are kind of close the same but they're a

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.850 
are kind of close the same but they're a
little<00:00:46.860> bit<00:00:47.010> different<00:00:48.110> also<00:00:49.110> i<00:00:49.350> thought<00:00:49.739> that

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
little bit different also i thought that

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.100 
little bit different also i thought that
was<00:00:49.920> cool<00:00:50.210> there's<00:00:51.210> also<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.629> bow<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:51.840> arrow

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
was cool there's also the bow and arrow

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.770 
was cool there's also the bow and arrow
the<00:00:52.530> if<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.980> can<00:00:53.160> see<00:00:53.340> here<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.000> arrow<00:00:54.210> has<00:00:54.570> a

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
the if you can see here the arrow has a

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.350 
the if you can see here the arrow has a
red<00:00:55.050> feather<00:00:55.289> which<00:00:55.559> i<00:00:55.710> think<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.100> needs

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
red feather which i think is it needs

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.430 
red feather which i think is it needs
when<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.420> drawing<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.780> back<00:00:57.930> into<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.260> red

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
when you drawing it back into the red

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.380 
when you drawing it back into the red
feather<00:00:58.680> too<00:00:58.920> but<00:00:59.609> it's<00:00:59.879> like<00:01:00.090> vanilla

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
feather too but it's like vanilla

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.670 
feather too but it's like vanilla
minecraft<00:01:00.510> from<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.020> way<00:01:01.109> when<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.320> shoot<00:01:01.350> it

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
minecraft from the way when you shoot it

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.930 
minecraft from the way when you shoot it
you<00:01:01.739> can<00:01:01.859> see<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.100> trail<00:01:02.340> behind<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.820> when

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
you can see the trail behind it when

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.369 
you can see the trail behind it when
it's<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.120> full-powered<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.899> all<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.170> kind<00:01:04.350> of

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
it's a full-powered and all that kind of

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.090 
it's a full-powered and all that kind of
stuff<00:01:06.080> also<00:01:07.080> although<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.530> apples<00:01:07.979> we're

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
stuff also although the apples we're

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.010 
stuff also although the apples we're
really<00:01:08.280> cool<00:01:08.520> they're<00:01:09.510> just<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.750> little<00:01:09.780> bit

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
really cool they're just a little bit

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.630 
really cool they're just a little bit
different<00:01:10.350> than<00:01:10.500> vanilla<00:01:10.740> minecraft<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
different than vanilla minecraft in the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.700 
different than vanilla minecraft in the
sense<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.240> gold<00:01:12.450> apples<00:01:12.869> have<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.409> gold

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
sense that the gold apples have a gold

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.230 
sense that the gold apples have a gold
leaf<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.280> regular<00:01:14.670> apple<00:01:14.820> just<00:01:15.090> have<00:01:15.210> a

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
leaf and the regular apple just have a

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.340 
leaf and the regular apple just have a
regular<00:01:15.360> leaf<00:01:15.750> which<00:01:15.900> i<00:01:15.990> thought<00:01:16.170> was<00:01:16.290> really

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
regular leaf which i thought was really

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.800 
regular leaf which i thought was really
cool<00:01:16.680> that's<00:01:17.640> just<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.850> little<00:01:18.060> side<00:01:18.240> effect<00:01:18.540> or

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
cool that's just a little side effect or

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.469 
cool that's just a little side effect or
side<00:01:19.110> note<00:01:19.350> some<00:01:19.790> also<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.909> orders<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.270> can
