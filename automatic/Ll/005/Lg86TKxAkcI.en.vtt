this<00:03:50.880> card<00:03:51.240> has<00:03:51.420> massive<00:03:52.080> upside<00:03:52.530> in<00:03:52.680> my

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
this card has massive upside in my

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.710 
this card has massive upside in my
opinion<00:03:53.280> you<00:03:53.760> know<00:03:53.880> I<00:03:53.910> think<00:03:54.060> that<00:03:54.330> it<00:03:54.540> was

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
opinion you know I think that it was

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.290 
opinion you know I think that it was
wisely<00:03:55.110> limited<00:03:55.920> to<00:03:56.070> main<00:03:56.250> phase<00:03:56.490> 2<00:03:56.760> otherwise

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
wisely limited to main phase 2 otherwise

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.000 
wisely limited to main phase 2 otherwise
it<00:03:57.540> just<00:03:57.720> would<00:03:57.840> have<00:03:57.870> been<00:03:57.990> a<00:03:58.290> ridiculously

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
it just would have been a ridiculously

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.949 
it just would have been a ridiculously
broken<00:03:59.550> card<00:03:59.820> that<00:04:00.120> would<00:04:00.720> have<00:04:00.810> had

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
broken card that would have had

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.110 
broken card that would have had
tour-guide<00:04:01.290> shenanigans<00:04:02.160> for<00:04:02.340> days<00:04:02.550> but<00:04:02.910> I
