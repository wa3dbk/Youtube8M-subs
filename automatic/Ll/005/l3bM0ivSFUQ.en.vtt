these<00:00:42.809> 1<00:00:43.500> by<00:00:43.530> 2<00:00:43.770> slants<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:44.820> make<00:00:45.750> look<00:00:45.989> a

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
these 1 by 2 slants and make look a

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.750 
these 1 by 2 slants and make look a
little<00:00:46.289> pattern<00:00:46.800> that's<00:00:47.010> about<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.670> it

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
little pattern that's about it and it

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.590 
little pattern that's about it and it
