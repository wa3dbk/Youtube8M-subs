00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:06.899
 good to all I am pot and good today 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:09.550
 I bring a trick in xbox minecraft 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.120
 I suppose that when they update it, 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:15.370
 will work the trick or not do not know for sure not 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.160
 is to have infinite objects just 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:21.400
 you need to have one and then you go 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.160
 multiplying by 64 of the time now what 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.220
 you will see that you need a dispenser 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.529
 of these and a trunk is good you put the 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.060
 object in the dispenser and your 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.390
 colleague has to break it once 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.039
 you have broken it will give you a state like 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.540
 you see in the inventory it says there's one 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:42.320
 more of them that are bored 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:45.440
 and you have to always open the trunk with 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:49.010
 and an object that is not played as 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.710
 diamonds of these then by the 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.060
 You go to the trunk and leave in the 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.010
 X and tight for 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.980
 to go putting one on one 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.160
 because if you do not see them you can use them 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.260
 I know what happens 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.260
 and well once you do the is that 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.930
 that is already 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.780
 it works already what you can use to do 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.050
 objects whatever the trick is 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.659
 can do with all the objects that 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.549
 there is 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.539
 and good I leave you here with the video and 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.539
 until production 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.340
 sometimes 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.790
 to 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.790
 we had same
