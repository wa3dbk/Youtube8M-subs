 call tom ok for this need to have 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.170
 obvious two different items and have 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.200
 After the tutorial you know what the 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.569
 tutorial when the teacher sends you 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.150
 so you talk to the other person 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:26.300
 will compete with you when your rival 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.700
 sorry and when you arrive and it gives you your 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.530
 touch of success because balls and and when 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.180
 you start your trip 'pokemones' when 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.280
 we can exchange because o mons up 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.709
 then no but for this we need 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.019
 have at least two pokemons in our 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.880
 inventory to be able to exchange 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.050
 then what we do will be what 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.019
 following 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.819
 we go here with the chavita and we will 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.680
 say that if we want to change with a 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.630
 friend we give him that if he shows us that 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.080
 that we are doing it correctly 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:57.330
 we give in that if you want to save and 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.300
 well we give them again yes 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.520
 very well we hope 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.020
 and if I wait a moment when we 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.150
 show this what we will do will be what 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.690
 Next we see where it says switch 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.120
 game and how do you see where the 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.860
 little blue dot this one means that it is 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.690
 where are we playing right now 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.690
 I'm going to jump to the other one that is the one 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.500
 up where I have the other heading as 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:25.230
 come here, this is where I am, alan ok 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:28.140
 we do the same we leave we want 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.420
 change and do not burn with a friend 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.970
 we say yes and we will do the same as 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:38.880
 keep the game all that yes 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.880
 will tell us that since we did it very well 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.380
 and it says that we confirm we give him ok 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.300
 very well we change the game again 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.709
 and it says and if you already appear to us it's like that 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:59.170
 we go back to the first one to give him 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:01.680
 new in to confirm 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.780
 ok since we give in confirm 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.260
 we will enter and as you can see there are the 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.870
 two 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:13.580
 then what we will do is put one 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:17.920
 at a table we change the game again 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.920
 and we do the same with the other monkey 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:25.979
 very good there according to what is loading us and 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.330
 good as you see there appears everything and alan 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:31.350
 so I think they are wrong 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:34.580
 change to this ghost 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.580
 we give you center 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.050
 and says wait a moment then 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.639
 we return to do the same thing we change the 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.900
 game 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:49.580
 and we are going to change to snif 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.580
 we give it back in try 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:57.310
 and we give him the new one that does 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:59.920
 we change our game 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:03.300
 and we give you that if a ready one is already 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.300
 will exchange the pokemon I 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.240
 As you can see, they are already exchanging 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.810
 good how are you watching but you hear us 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:26.110
 a lot of background noise and good as 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:28.650

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.650
 I will teach 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:44.150
 and we wait for it to end and as you see in the 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.740
 Tom's team is already at ibi and 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.620
 in mine 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.660
 but they will say I wanted to change a pokémon 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.940
 well but I do not want to lose the same game 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:56.539
 it's very easy guys just close the 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.069
 starting because by not starting 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:00.020

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:02.539

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.550

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:06.530

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:15.730
 because I do not want a pokémon anymore 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:20.920

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:26.350

 As you can see, everything has ended 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.280
 we left 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.419
