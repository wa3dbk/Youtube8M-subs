hey guys vasily from OCLC playground and

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.290 
hey guys vasily from OCLC playground and
today<00:00:19.859> I'm<00:00:19.980> going<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.220> do<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.490> very<00:00:20.730> quick<00:00:20.760> video

the sky RC RS 16 charger now this is

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.939 
the sky RC RS 16 charger now this is
both<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.390> charger<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:27.960> power<00:00:28.260> supply<00:00:28.650> that<00:00:28.890> you

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
both a charger and power supply that you

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.450 
both a charger and power supply that you
buy<00:00:29.640> separately<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:31.170> can<00:00:31.410> have<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:32.160> different

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
buy separately you can have a different

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.889 
buy separately you can have a different
power<00:00:32.610> supply<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.030> this<00:00:33.239> one<00:00:33.480> here<00:00:33.690> if<00:00:33.780> you're

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
power supply to this one here if you're

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.120 
power supply to this one here if you're
not<00:00:33.930> comfortable<00:00:34.200> having<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.739> charge<00:00:34.980> of

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
not comfortable having the charge of

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.770 
not comfortable having the charge of
sitting<00:00:35.370> on<00:00:35.460> top<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.730> power<00:00:35.910> supply<00:00:36.270> but

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
sitting on top of the power supply but

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.479 
sitting on top of the power supply but
they<00:00:36.930> are<00:00:37.079> designed<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.680> integrate<00:00:38.219> with<00:00:38.399> each

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
they are designed to integrate with each

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.520 
they are designed to integrate with each
other<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.600> it's<00:00:39.750> actually<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> very<00:00:40.230> neat<00:00:40.500> and

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
other and it's actually a very neat and

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.979 
other and it's actually a very neat and
simple<00:00:41.250> system<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:41.910> gives<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.840> very

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
simple system that gives you a very

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.709 
simple system that gives you a very
small<00:00:43.290> footprint<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.910> charger<00:00:45.329> rather<00:00:45.510> than

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
small footprint of a charger rather than

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.060 
small footprint of a charger rather than
having<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.110> charger<00:00:46.440> itself<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.890> then<00:00:46.980> a

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
having the charger itself and then a

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.119 
having the charger itself and then a
huge<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.910> know<00:00:47.940> separate<00:00:48.360> power<00:00:48.690> supply<00:00:49.129> sort

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
huge you know separate power supply sort

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.639 
huge you know separate power supply sort
of<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.520> side<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.000> charger<00:00:51.530> and<00:00:52.530> I've

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
of to the side of the charger and I've

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.560 
of to the side of the charger and I've
been<00:00:52.860> very<00:00:53.039> very<00:00:53.219> happy<00:00:53.579> with<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.000> I've<00:00:54.329> had

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
been very very happy with it so I've had

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.240 
been very very happy with it so I've had
a<00:00:54.600> few<00:00:54.719> people<00:00:54.840> ask<00:00:55.140> me<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.559> take<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.070> through

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
a few people ask me to take you through

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.650 
a few people ask me to take you through
some<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.520> menus<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.059> show<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.329> some<00:00:57.570> of

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
some of the menus and show you some of

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.900 
some of the menus and show you some of
the<00:00:57.719> features<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.199> has<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:59.520> figured

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
the features that it has and I figured

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.490 
the features that it has and I figured
yeah<00:01:00.059> why<00:01:00.359> not<00:01:00.539> do<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.750> quick<00:01:00.960> video<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.230> show

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
yeah why not do a quick video and show

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.280 
yeah why not do a quick video and show
you<00:01:01.530> all<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:01.920> now<00:01:02.780> I've<00:01:03.780> currently<00:01:04.080> got

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
you all of that now I've currently got

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.820 
you all of that now I've currently got
the<00:01:04.680> I've<00:01:05.250> pretty<00:01:05.790> much<00:01:05.880> have<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.210> charger

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
the I've pretty much have the charger

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.710 
the I've pretty much have the charger
plugged<00:01:07.830> in<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.220> whole<00:01:08.400> time<00:01:08.760> because<00:01:09.600> it

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
plugged in the whole time because it

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.179 
plugged in the whole time because it
hasn't<00:01:09.869> on<00:01:10.049> an<00:01:10.170> off<00:01:10.290> switch<00:01:10.439> here<00:01:10.770> on<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.979> side

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
hasn't on an off switch here on the side

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.780 
hasn't on an off switch here on the side
so<00:01:11.430> if<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.580> go<00:01:11.729> ahead<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.150> turn<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.780> guy<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.790> it

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
so if I go ahead and turn this guy on it

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.899 
so if I go ahead and turn this guy on it
boots<00:01:15.090> up<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:16.250> there<00:01:17.250> we<00:01:17.340> go<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:17.640> have<00:01:17.670> our

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.820 
boots up and there we go we have our
light<00:01:18.119> player<00:01:18.360> balance<00:01:18.780> now<00:01:18.960> we<00:01:19.020> can<00:01:19.320> flick

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
light player balance now we can flick

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.160 
light player balance now we can flick
over<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> left<00:01:20.490> here<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.049> just<00:01:22.049> go

which I've been using on my excellent
will<00:02:03.540> plug<00:02:03.840> this<00:02:04.020> guy<00:02:04.079> in<00:02:04.460> and<00:02:05.460> I'll<00:02:05.820> show<00:02:05.939> you

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
will plug this guy in and I'll show you

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.550 
will plug this guy in and I'll show you
very<00:02:06.210> quickly<00:02:06.240> just<00:02:06.509> how<00:02:06.750> all<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.140> works<00:02:07.380> so

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
very quickly just how all this works so

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.680 
very quickly just how all this works so
the<00:02:08.459> balance<00:02:08.759> board<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.090> very<00:02:09.179> nice<00:02:09.450> and

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
the balance board is very nice and

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.059 
the balance board is very nice and
simple<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:10.110> use

simple to use

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.010 
simple to use
you've<00:02:11.520> got<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.790> all<00:02:11.879> sort<00:02:12.120> of<00:02:12.180> color<00:02:12.420> coded<00:02:12.840> so

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
you've got it all sort of color coded so

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.210 
you've got it all sort of color coded so
you

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
you

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.210 
you
2's<00:02:13.550> is<00:02:13.760> in<00:02:13.910> white<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:14.600> 3<00:02:14.960> s<00:02:15.080> is<00:02:15.260> in<00:02:15.380> black<00:02:15.620> so

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
2's is in white and 3 s is in black so

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.970 
2's is in white and 3 s is in black so
on<00:02:16.430> very<00:02:17.300> nice<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.110> simple<00:02:18.230> to<00:02:18.500> use<00:02:18.680> so<00:02:18.890> I'll

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
on very nice and simple to use so I'll

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.150 
on very nice and simple to use so I'll
just<00:02:19.190> plug<00:02:19.400> my<00:02:19.550> 3<00:02:19.910> s<00:02:20.000> battery<00:02:20.360> in<00:02:20.480> there

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
just plug my 3 s battery in there

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.970 
just plug my 3 s battery in there
flick<00:02:22.160> over<00:02:22.370> to<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.270> right<00:02:23.480> and<00:02:23.900> it<00:02:24.320> tells<00:02:24.830> me

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
flick over to the right and it tells me

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.790 
flick over to the right and it tells me
the<00:02:25.310> voltage<00:02:25.640> of<00:02:25.820> each<00:02:25.970> cell<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:26.690> for<00:02:27.500> a<00:02:27.530> zippy

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
the voltage of each cell and for a zippy

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.380 
the voltage of each cell and for a zippy
battery<00:02:28.190> you<00:02:28.340> know<00:02:28.430> a<00:02:28.460> fairly<00:02:28.790> cheap<00:02:29.030> battery

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
battery you know a fairly cheap battery

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.000 
battery you know a fairly cheap battery
I<00:02:29.420> think<00:02:29.660> this<00:02:29.750> was<00:02:29.930> like<00:02:30.080> 10<00:02:30.620> bucks<00:02:30.830> or

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
I think this was like 10 bucks or

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.190 
I think this was like 10 bucks or
something<00:02:31.100> more<00:02:31.400> than<00:02:31.580> less<00:02:31.730> than<00:02:31.910> that<00:02:32.200> very

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
something more than less than that very

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.110 
something more than less than that very
well<00:02:33.740> balanced<00:02:34.310> you<00:02:34.550> can<00:02:34.610> see<00:02:34.820> there's<00:02:35.000> only

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
well balanced you can see there's only

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.730 
well balanced you can see there's only
point<00:02:35.420> 1<00:02:35.600> of<00:02:35.720> a<00:02:35.780> volt<00:02:35.990> difference<00:02:36.260> on<00:02:36.590> this

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
point 1 of a volt difference on this

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.670 
point 1 of a volt difference on this
particular<00:02:37.070> cell<00:02:37.520> here<00:02:37.790> so<00:02:38.030> very<00:02:38.300> nice<00:02:38.680> and

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
particular cell here so very nice and

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.620 
particular cell here so very nice and
then<00:02:39.800> we<00:02:39.860> can<00:02:40.010> scroll<00:02:40.280> down<00:02:40.340> and<00:02:40.850> it<00:02:41.420> will<00:02:41.510> give

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
then we can scroll down and it will give

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.170 
then we can scroll down and it will give
you<00:02:41.690> a<00:02:41.750> total<00:02:42.020> main<00:02:42.410> voltage<00:02:42.860> there<00:02:43.160> I'm<00:02:43.910> not

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
you a total main voltage there I'm not

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.000 
you a total main voltage there I'm not
100%<00:02:44.630> sure<00:02:44.900> what<00:02:44.990> these<00:02:45.260> two<00:02:45.440> bottom<00:02:45.709> ones<00:02:45.740> are

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
100% sure what these two bottom ones are

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.949 
100% sure what these two bottom ones are
but<00:02:46.190> I<00:02:46.280> guess<00:02:46.430> you<00:02:46.550> can<00:02:46.670> always<00:02:46.760> fill<00:02:47.630> that<00:02:47.780> in

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
but I guess you can always fill that in

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.650 
but I guess you can always fill that in
in<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:48.200> comments<00:02:48.410> below<00:02:48.650> and<00:02:49.450> that's<00:02:50.450> pretty

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
in the comments below and that's pretty

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.860 
in the comments below and that's pretty
much<00:02:50.810> it<00:02:51.020> so<00:02:51.050> we<00:02:51.290> can<00:02:51.440> exit<00:02:51.770> out<00:02:51.860> of<00:02:51.920> this<00:02:52.870> more

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
much it so we can exit out of this more

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.770 
much it so we can exit out of this more
battery<00:02:54.230> chemistry's<00:02:54.800> there<00:02:55.150> so<00:02:56.150> pretty

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
battery chemistry's there so pretty

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.510 
battery chemistry's there so pretty
straightforward<00:02:57.140> there's<00:02:57.740> really<00:02:57.890> not<00:02:58.190> a

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
straightforward there's really not a

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.670 
straightforward there's really not a
huge<00:02:59.300> amount<00:02:59.540> of<00:02:59.780> things<00:03:00.020> that<00:03:00.230> you<00:03:00.320> can<00:03:00.530> do

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
huge amount of things that you can do

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.900 
huge amount of things that you can do
with<00:03:00.890> this<00:03:01.040> but<00:03:01.730> for<00:03:02.209> basic<00:03:02.510> charging<00:03:03.370> I<00:03:04.370> think

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
with this but for basic charging I think

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.350 
with this but for basic charging I think
this<00:03:05.270> is<00:03:05.620> perfect<00:03:06.620> for<00:03:06.830> what<00:03:07.010> I<00:03:07.070> need<00:03:07.370> now<00:03:08.060> it

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
this is perfect for what I need now it

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.699 
this is perfect for what I need now it
is<00:03:08.570> a<00:03:08.600> 16<00:03:08.990> M<00:03:09.290> charger<00:03:09.860> and<00:03:11.200> even<00:03:12.200> with<00:03:12.350> balance

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
is a 16 M charger and even with balance

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.910 
is a 16 M charger and even with balance
here<00:03:12.920> you<00:03:13.100> can<00:03:13.310> you<00:03:13.640> can<00:03:13.790> discharge<00:03:14.920> storage

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
here you can you can discharge storage

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.190 
here you can you can discharge storage
you<00:03:16.550> got<00:03:16.700> fast<00:03:16.940> charging<00:03:17.420> or<00:03:17.750> just<00:03:17.959> plain

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
you got fast charging or just plain

do I have batteries that will go all the
way<00:04:49.240> to<00:04:49.360> 16<00:04:49.900> amps<00:04:50.229> and<00:04:50.380> kinda<00:04:50.919> hover<00:04:51.190> there

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
way to 16 amps and kinda hover there

it you know 10 plus amps you'll see
that's<00:06:38.810> now<00:06:39.590> to<00:06:39.650> climb<00:06:40.010> up<00:06:40.160> to<00:06:40.280> we've<00:06:40.400> added<00:06:40.580> 11

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:40.850 
that's now to climb up to we've added 11

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.260 
that's now to climb up to we've added 11
amps<00:06:41.150> and<00:06:41.980> sure<00:06:42.980> enough<00:06:43.010> you'll<00:06:43.400> see<00:06:43.490> here

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.270 
amps and sure enough you'll see here

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.720 
amps and sure enough you'll see here
that<00:06:44.300> this<00:06:44.800> once<00:06:45.800> I<00:06:45.920> think<00:06:46.010> it<00:06:46.220> hits<00:06:46.400> max

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:46.730 
that this once I think it hits max

the fans have now kicked in it's taken a
few<00:06:53.150> minutes<00:06:53.390> to<00:06:53.570> get<00:06:53.690> there<00:06:53.960> the<00:06:54.800> charger<00:06:55.190> was

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:55.310 
few minutes to get there the charger was

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:56.980 
few minutes to get there the charger was
actually<00:06:55.700> hovering<00:06:56.030> around<00:06:56.210> the<00:06:56.450> fourteen

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:56.990 
actually hovering around the fourteen

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.960 
actually hovering around the fourteen
point<00:06:57.350> five<00:06:57.590> amps<00:06:58.160> that's<00:06:58.370> roughly<00:06:58.790> where<00:06:58.940> it

00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:58.970 
point five amps that's roughly where it

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.050 
point five amps that's roughly where it
peaked<00:06:59.530> so<00:07:00.530> you<00:07:00.590> you<00:07:01.100> know<00:07:01.220> as<00:07:01.400> I<00:07:01.490> said<00:07:01.550> it<00:07:01.850> does

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:02.060 
peaked so you you know as I said it does

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.930 
peaked so you you know as I said it does
not<00:07:02.090> go<00:07:02.450> to<00:07:02.720> 16<00:07:03.110> amps<00:07:03.380> all<00:07:03.560> the<00:07:03.890> time<00:07:04.130> it's<00:07:04.730> now

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:04.940 
not go to 16 amps all the time it's now

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.820 
not go to 16 amps all the time it's now
dropped<00:07:05.210> down<00:07:05.270> to<00:07:05.420> about<00:07:05.570> twelve<00:07:06.110> point<00:07:06.560> two

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:06.830 
dropped down to about twelve point two

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.560 
dropped down to about twelve point two
amps<00:07:07.190> looks<00:07:07.580> like<00:07:07.700> it's<00:07:07.880> dropping<00:07:08.120> already

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:08.570 
amps looks like it's dropping already

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:10.300 
amps looks like it's dropping already
now<00:07:09.140> that<00:07:09.320> the<00:07:09.440> check<00:07:09.650> the<00:07:09.800> battery<00:07:10.250> is

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:10.310 
now that the check the battery is

now that the check the battery is
starting<00:07:10.580> to<00:07:10.730> fill<00:07:10.940> up<00:07:11.090> a<00:07:11.240> bit<00:07:11.650> you'll<00:07:12.650> notice

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.010 
starting to fill up a bit you'll notice

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:14.800 
starting to fill up a bit you'll notice
that<00:07:13.160> it'll<00:07:13.580> drop<00:07:13.880> down<00:07:13.940> so<00:07:14.330> it's<00:07:14.450> gone<00:07:14.630> down

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:14.810 
that it'll drop down so it's gone down

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.410 
that it'll drop down so it's gone down
just<00:07:15.170> below<00:07:15.320> seven<00:07:15.800> amps<00:07:15.980> and<00:07:16.310> it'll<00:07:17.270> keep

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:17.420 
just below seven amps and it'll keep

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.860 
just below seven amps and it'll keep
varying<00:07:18.350> its<00:07:18.500> amp<00:07:18.740> each<00:07:18.920> depending<00:07:19.880> on<00:07:20.030> what's

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:20.870 
varying its amp each depending on what's

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.020 
varying its amp each depending on what's
happening<00:07:21.200> with<00:07:21.350> the<00:07:21.470> battery<00:07:21.830> so<00:07:22.010> very<00:07:22.790> very

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:23.030 
happening with the battery so very very

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:24.670 
happening with the battery so very very
