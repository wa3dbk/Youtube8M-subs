we want to be able to see it and so roll

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.539 
we want to be able to see it and so roll
it<00:02:23.760> out<00:02:23.969> until<00:02:24.900> it's<00:02:25.290> like<00:02:25.709> a<00:02:25.739> quarter<00:02:26.310> of<00:02:26.340> an

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
it out until it's like a quarter of an

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:31.490 
it out until it's like a quarter of an
inch<00:02:26.670> thick<00:02:27.439> maybe<00:02:28.439> not<00:02:28.680> even<00:02:28.709> that<00:02:30.500> it's

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
inch thick maybe not even that it's

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.160 
inch thick maybe not even that it's
quite<00:02:31.859> thin<00:02:32.280> but<00:02:32.819> not<00:02:33.000> too<00:02:33.329> thin<00:02:33.659> to<00:02:33.900> alert

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
quite thin but not too thin to alert

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.539 
quite thin but not too thin to alert
breaks<00:02:34.560> you'll<00:02:34.829> just<00:02:35.010> have<00:02:35.159> to<00:02:35.280> judge<00:02:35.519> for

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
breaks you'll just have to judge for

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.039 
breaks you'll just have to judge for
yourself<00:02:36.239> so<00:02:37.079> here<00:02:37.290> I've<00:02:37.409> rolled<00:02:37.680> it<00:02:37.920> out<00:02:38.069> and

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
yourself so here I've rolled it out and

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:44.030 
yourself so here I've rolled it out and
it's<00:02:40.049> about<00:02:40.290> this<00:02:40.560> thick<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:42.139> I<00:02:43.139> our<00:02:43.560> next

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
it's about this thick and I our next

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.800 
it's about this thick and I our next
step<00:02:44.250> is<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.459> roll<00:02:45.180> out<00:02:45.299> all<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.659> other

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
step is to roll out all the other

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.319 
step is to roll out all the other
dough's<00:02:46.079> and<00:02:46.290> put<00:02:47.099> them<00:02:47.340> on<00:02:47.579> top<00:02:48.090> of<00:02:48.150> each

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
dough's and put them on top of each

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:49.640 
dough's and put them on top of each
other<00:02:48.510> you're<00:02:48.780> going<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:48.959> stack<00:02:49.230> them<00:02:49.409> on<00:02:49.560> top

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
other you're going to stack them on top

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.259 
other you're going to stack them on top
of<00:02:49.919> each<00:02:50.189> other<00:02:52.189> so<00:02:53.189> here<00:02:53.519> I<00:02:53.549> rolled<00:02:53.970> out<00:02:54.120> my

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
of each other so here I rolled out my

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:55.729 
of each other so here I rolled out my
dough's<00:02:54.540> you<00:02:54.780> can<00:02:54.900> see<00:02:55.049> the<00:02:55.169> purple<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:55.650> the

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
dough's you can see the purple and the

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.129 
dough's you can see the purple and the
green<00:02:55.799> there<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.400> tore<00:02:56.970> it<00:02:57.120> off<00:02:57.239> so<00:02:57.510> you<00:02:57.599> can<00:02:57.840> see

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
green there I tore it off so you can see

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:00.140 
green there I tore it off so you can see
i<00:02:58.379> stacked<00:02:58.889> them<00:02:59.010> on<00:02:59.159> top<00:02:59.220> of<00:02:59.400> each<00:02:59.609> other<00:02:59.819> and

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
i stacked them on top of each other and

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.899 
i stacked them on top of each other and
now<00:03:00.599> I<00:03:00.629> am<00:03:01.049> rolling<00:03:01.709> them<00:03:01.919> into<00:03:02.340> like<00:03:02.489> a<00:03:02.519> jelly

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
now I am rolling them into like a jelly

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.119 
now I am rolling them into like a jelly
roll<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.480> this<00:03:04.079> is<00:03:04.230> kind<00:03:04.469> of<00:03:04.530> hard<00:03:04.739> you<00:03:04.919> want

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
to keep it smooth you want to use your

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:11.619 
to keep it smooth you want to use your
wax<00:03:07.650> paper<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.849> roll<00:03:09.299> it<00:03:09.599> into<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:10.200> nice<00:03:10.799> little

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.809 
wax paper to roll it into a nice little
jelly<00:03:12.629> roll<00:03:13.010> if<00:03:14.010> you've<00:03:14.189> ever<00:03:14.310> had<00:03:14.519> jelly

keep rolling rolling rolling rolling and

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:24.140 
keep rolling rolling rolling rolling and
then<00:03:21.560> once<00:03:22.560> you<00:03:22.650> get<00:03:22.799> to<00:03:22.829> the<00:03:23.010> end<00:03:23.220> just<00:03:23.909> kind

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
then once you get to the end just kind

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.839 
then once you get to the end just kind
of<00:03:24.239> tuck<00:03:24.510> it<00:03:24.690> over<00:03:25.109> and<00:03:25.669> you're<00:03:26.669> going<00:03:26.790> to

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
of tuck it over and you're going to

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.059 
of tuck it over and you're going to
place<00:03:27.090> this<00:03:27.269> in<00:03:27.329> the<00:03:27.569> refrigerator<00:03:27.659> for<00:03:28.349> 1<00:03:28.530> to

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
place this in the refrigerator for 1 to

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:34.119 
place this in the refrigerator for 1 to
2<00:03:29.099> hours<00:03:29.489> and<00:03:30.090> that<00:03:31.049> makes<00:03:31.349> it<00:03:31.500> easier<00:03:31.949> to<00:03:32.040> cut

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.129 
2 hours and that makes it easier to cut

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.259 
2 hours and that makes it easier to cut
because<00:03:35.129> our<00:03:35.280> next<00:03:35.579> step<00:03:35.729> we're<00:03:35.879> going<00:03:35.909> to<00:03:36.030> cut

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
because our next step we're going to cut

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.369 
because our next step we're going to cut
slices<00:03:36.569> off<00:03:36.989> so<00:03:37.650> refrigerate<00:03:38.549> it<00:03:39.109> once<00:03:40.109> it's

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
slices off so refrigerate it once it's

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.259 
slices off so refrigerate it once it's
cooled<00:03:41.010> off<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:41.639> it's<00:03:41.790> been<00:03:41.939> refrigerated

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
cooled off and it's been refrigerated

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.360 
cooled off and it's been refrigerated
for<00:03:42.750> one<00:03:42.900> to<00:03:42.989> two<00:03:43.049> hours<00:03:43.319> you<00:03:43.650> want<00:03:43.829> to<00:03:43.919> roll<00:03:44.159> it

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
for one to two hours you want to roll it

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.330 
for one to two hours you want to roll it
in<00:03:44.519> a<00:03:44.639> pan<00:03:44.879> of<00:03:44.909> sprinkles<00:03:45.449> and<00:03:45.840> you<00:03:46.349> just<00:03:46.530> roll

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
in a pan of sprinkles and you just roll

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.339 
in a pan of sprinkles and you just roll
it<00:03:47.579> until<00:03:47.849> all<00:03:47.879> the<00:03:48.030> sprinkles<00:03:48.419> stick<00:03:48.810> on<00:03:48.989> it

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.020 

you<00:03:52.349> can<00:03:52.530> actually<00:03:52.739> instead<00:03:53.400> of<00:03:53.519> rolling<00:03:53.759> it

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
you can actually instead of rolling it

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.030 
you can actually instead of rolling it
in<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.180> pan<00:03:54.479> you<00:03:54.720> can<00:03:54.900> cut<00:03:55.229> it<00:03:55.259> first<00:03:55.620> and<00:03:56.009> then

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
in the pan you can cut it first and then

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.300 
in the pan you can cut it first and then
roll<00:03:56.819> them<00:03:57.090> but<00:03:57.959> it's<00:03:58.259> up<00:03:58.439> to<00:03:58.590> you<00:03:58.769> however<00:03:59.040> you
