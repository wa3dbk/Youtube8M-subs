because I remember last year I come over

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.390 
because I remember last year I come over
who<00:01:15.810> got<00:01:15.960> on<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.200> might<00:01:16.350> be<00:01:16.470> Oh<00:01:16.500> shall<00:01:16.920> we<00:01:16.950> but

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.890 
who got on it might be Oh shall we but
basically<00:01:17.610> they<00:01:18.060> don't<00:01:18.210> know<00:01:18.299> show<00:01:18.509> his<00:01:18.659> card

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900

and they matched his inform card which

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.550 
and they matched his inform card which
obviously<00:01:20.909> made<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.299> inform<00:01:21.630> pretty<00:01:22.259> much

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
obviously made it inform pretty much

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.870 
obviously made it inform pretty much
valueless<00:01:22.950> because<00:01:23.430> it's<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.640> exact<00:01:23.850> same

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
valueless because it's the exact same

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.910 
valueless because it's the exact same
card<00:01:24.330> all<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.110> look<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.439> little<00:01:25.619> bit

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
card all it is is look a little bit

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.440 
card all it is is look a little bit
different<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.430> that's<00:01:26.790> basic<00:01:27.090> reason<00:01:27.330> they've

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
different so that's basic reason they've

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.450 
different so that's basic reason they've
done<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.930> yellow<00:01:28.890> spies<00:01:29.159> went<00:01:29.310> for

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
done that and yellow spies went for

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.960 
done that and yellow spies went for
about<00:01:29.549> 700<00:01:30.150> k<00:01:30.299> 2<00:01:30.840> over<00:01:31.409> 1.2<00:01:31.950> million<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.520> he's

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
about 700 k 2 over 1.2 million so he's

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.550 
about 700 k 2 over 1.2 million so he's
jumped<00:01:33.360> up<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.509> lot<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.720> coins<00:01:33.900> need<00:01:34.140> doubled<00:01:34.500> in

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
jumped up a lot of coins need doubled in

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.219 
jumped up a lot of coins need doubled in
price<00:01:34.680> if<00:01:35.040> not<00:01:35.280> doubled<00:01:35.670> in<00:01:35.759> price<00:01:35.880> so<00:01:36.689> if<00:01:36.930> if

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
price if not doubled in price so if if

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.140 
price if not doubled in price so if if
you<00:01:37.470> have<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.740> lot<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:37.950> coins<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.460> you're

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
you have a lot of coins and you're

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.550 
you have a lot of coins and you're
willing<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.420> take<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.570> risk<00:01:39.689> for<00:01:40.049> potential

so you may have to invest a little bit

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.460 
so you may have to invest a little bit
and<00:01:47.460> be<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:47.970> bit<00:01:48.149> patient<00:01:48.360> but<00:01:48.899> overall<00:01:49.140> players

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
that could get upgrades and obviously

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.999 
that could get upgrades and obviously

hazard and he's going for 1.9 million if

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.080 
hazard and he's going for 1.9 million if
I'm<00:01:57.299> right<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.630> he<00:01:57.750> does<00:01:58.079> cost<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.590> lot<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:58.979> money

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
I'm right so he does cost a lot of money

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.429 
I'm right so he does cost a lot of money
but<00:02:00.090> if<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.240> did<00:02:00.329> have<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.570> coins<00:02:00.840> I'd

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
but if you did have the coins I'd

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.380 
but if you did have the coins I'd
recommend<00:02:01.920> pick<00:02:02.159> him<00:02:02.280> up<00:02:02.399> just<00:02:02.700> in<00:02:02.909> case<00:02:02.939> he

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
recommend pick him up just in case he

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.209 
recommend pick him up just in case he
does<00:02:03.689> get<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.229> upgrade<00:02:04.619> because<00:02:04.770> he's

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
does get that upgrade because he's

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.679 
does get that upgrade because he's
outgrowing<00:02:05.520> dupree<00:02:05.820> goats<00:02:06.060> like<00:02:06.270> his<00:02:06.479> night<00:02:06.630> I

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
outgrowing dupree goats like his night I

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.169 
outgrowing dupree goats like his night I
think<00:02:06.960> it's<00:02:07.079> 90<00:02:07.380> rated<00:02:07.740> or<00:02:07.920> aid<00:02:08.610> know<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.149> I

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
think it's 90 rated or aid know is I

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.660 
think it's 90 rated or aid know is I
kind<00:02:09.629> of<00:02:09.720> rating<00:02:10.259> is<00:02:10.379> but<00:02:10.590> nevertheless<00:02:10.860> he

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
kind of rating is but nevertheless he

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.010 
kind of rating is but nevertheless he
will<00:02:11.819> jump<00:02:12.000> up<00:02:12.150> if<00:02:12.330> he<00:02:12.360> gets<00:02:12.599> out<00:02:12.690> great<00:02:12.930> and

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
will jump up if he gets out great and

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.790 
will jump up if he gets out great and
that<00:02:13.140> means<00:02:13.319> his<00:02:13.410> value

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
that means his value

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.160 
that means his value
do<00:02:13.920> Suarez<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.520> go<00:02:15.120> up<00:02:15.210> even<00:02:15.360> more<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:15.960> that's

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
do Suarez and go up even more so that's

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.780 
do Suarez and go up even more so that's
that's<00:02:16.350> potential<00:02:16.770> one<00:02:16.860> there<00:02:17.040> Jessica

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
that's potential one there Jessica

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.160 
that's potential one there Jessica
Rodriguez<00:02:18.240> obviously<00:02:18.660> he<00:02:18.810> hasn't<00:02:18.960> got

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
Rodriguez obviously he hasn't got

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.750 
Rodriguez obviously he hasn't got
informed<00:02:19.530> so<00:02:19.620> it<00:02:19.950> wouldn't<00:02:20.220> affect<00:02:20.280> his<00:02:20.550> price

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
informed so it wouldn't affect his price

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.420 
informed so it wouldn't affect his price
at<00:02:20.940> already<00:02:21.270> de<00:02:21.930> acosta<00:02:22.290> he<00:02:22.920> could<00:02:23.040> be<00:02:23.130> a<00:02:23.160> cool

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
at already de acosta he could be a cool

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.640 
at already de acosta he could be a cool
one<00:02:23.520> because<00:02:23.640> if<00:02:24.060> I'm<00:02:24.600> right<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:25.200> think

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
one because if I'm right I think

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.960 
one because if I'm right I think
personally<00:02:26.070> if<00:02:26.280> Dave<00:02:26.430> Acosta<00:02:26.760> gets<00:02:26.910> an

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
personally if Dave Acosta gets an

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.530 
personally if Dave Acosta gets an
upgrade<00:02:27.090> he<00:02:27.570> will<00:02:27.750> get<00:02:27.990> a<00:02:28.200> spanish<00:02:29.130> flag

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
upgrade he will get a spanish flag

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.790 
upgrade he will get a spanish flag
obviously<00:02:30.540> I<00:02:30.690> think<00:02:30.810> he's<00:02:31.140> eligible<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.740> play

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
obviously I think he's eligible to play

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.220 
obviously I think he's eligible to play
for<00:02:31.890> Spain<00:02:32.130> now<00:02:32.460> so<00:02:33.180> that's<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.750> good<00:02:33.780> one<00:02:34.110> to

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
for Spain now so that's a good one to

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.230 
for Spain now so that's a good one to
