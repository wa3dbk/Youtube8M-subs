00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:06.660
 Hello guys 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.469
 I will teach them how to reproduce their 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:14.219
 media files from your samsung galaxy 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:18.840
 s 4 or galaxy 5 even the galaxy s 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:23.660
 3 on any television set connected to 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:27.570
 the same wifi network on the same router 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:31.140
 in this case is kept any weapons 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.210
 smart tv it is possible to make 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.000
 transfer of the file is actually 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.239
 playback of the mobile phone file in the 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.030
 TV without having to resort to this 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:46.379
 a lot of crazy programs that you 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.860
 will find in the prehistory case or 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:53.760
 any other resource that may cause 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.430
 damage to your device because you 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:03.629
 with this default feature 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:05.549
 the galaxy is 4 galaxy 5 thousand and my case 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.630
 here is enabled 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.479
 I can even leave off screaming 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:17.939
 because if you produce the movie through 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.970
 of your standard samsung galaxy s player 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:25.290
 4 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:30.710
 it will enable to touch the screen the 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:32.700
 upper left corner feature 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.640
 this option appears 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.579
 you touch the inem 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.579
 he goes he has the devices that 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.549
 are connected to your wi fi 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:49.079
 in the case of my wifi network its coast 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:56.610
 this TV is connected and of course the cell phone 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:58.610
 to access the device rang in the 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.300
 TV 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:05.340
 automatically 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:08.890
 video will be downloaded to see you 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.860
 This movie is in the sense galaxy s 4g 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:15.760
 is in the phone memory being 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:19.090
 even on TV, it is possible to 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:27.520
 make all controls by own 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:31.150
 cell phone or if you think it's best for tv 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:34.110
 [Music] 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.780
 [Applause] 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.210
 this is the simplest way not to install 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.620
 in programs since it is a resource that the 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:45.320
 your cell phone 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:48.600
 another possibility that you can 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.750
 also to reproduce their 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:55.950
 media files on your TV set 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:03:02.130
 if your TV is continuous cost resource 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:06.390
 the media server in case I go to 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:11.150
 the movie here and I'm going to use a 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.150
 media from my tv set 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:25.830
 I want to come, I'll be able to see my 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.390
 as a media server 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:32.130
 available 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.980
 how is it possible that just in your 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:39.360
 cell phone 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:41.780
 you leave this feature enabled in the 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.540
 settings for your phone 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:49.130
 connection settings at the end 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:52.850
 below you will have the option 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:55.070
 possibility of enable devices 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.260
 devices the possibility 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:01.739
 automatically your phone your 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:05.430
 4 Samsung Galaxy 5 Galaxy even 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:07.709
 s3 will become a media server 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.720
 for your TV because they 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.940
 are attached thereto the shooter the same 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.019
 Wifi network 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.769
 sharing the same password 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.690
 access 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:19.950
 I'll go with the TV remote control. 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:25.050
 access the videos that are here on 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:30.020
 and I will reproduce the same 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:33.289
 video I wrote and wrote it 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.689
 through the server 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:37.129
 myth is more practical if you have a 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:40.129
 large amount of film to 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:42.880
 play but I do not want to be all 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:45.040
 TV set that has it 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.360
 [Music] 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.020
 [Applause] 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.849
 this is urgent resources in which your 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.240
 already offers you the standard 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:58.120
 need to install any program to 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.830

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.860
 [Music]
