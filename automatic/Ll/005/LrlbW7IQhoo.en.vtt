 another one for sony or for that of 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.460
 Microsoft attentive because quantum break 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.010
 you already know that it is the flagship title of 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.750
 xbox one is a title that we 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.010
 presented from the start and 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.660
 the truth is that has brought 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.030
 enough people also have a concept 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.720
 quite innovative there is new information 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.880
 about this title and finally we have 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.310

 xbox one we are talking about the 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.670
 expected quantum break the title that 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.309
 he introduced himself to us on his own 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.370
 presentation of xbox one before 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.680
 past e3 sam lake creative director of 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.140
 remedy has revealed that in quantum break 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.719
 the next title of the company in 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.520
 exclusive for xbox one not only 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.469
 let's control our protagonist 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.840
 but we will also control Paul 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:01.180
 scheer in the bad of the story according to 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.280
 the law itself in a very similar way 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.019
 to what we have seen in the jungle of 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.670
 crystal ' this creative director has 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.510
 wanted to explain that they want me to 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.220
 let's have him 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.200
 about the decisions of our 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.150
 antagonist want us to convert it 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.460
 in a totally complex character and 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.800
 deep that we will see different 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.900
 sides so we understand why they do 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.480
 what he is doing and why he puts us 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.400
 things so difficult we also go to 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.500
 have the possibility of throwing small 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.750
 glances at moments of the past through 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.640
 of flashback we can also see things 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.210
 of the future and make decisions at 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.850
 respect 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.160
 all this will lead to more situations 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.460
 dynamics at the end of each chapter of 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.080
 this quantum all these decisions 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.090
 will condition the next chapter of 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.190
 the history of quantum break all this 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.500
 it will affect the whole title argument 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.600
 with its negative part and its part 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.000
 positive and will allow access to some 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.800
 contents or other different the next 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.650
 December 7 will be a great 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.290
 date for this title since in the vx 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.720
 the first trailer will be presented where 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.050
 show the playability of this quantum 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.050
 break
