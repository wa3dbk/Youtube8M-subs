I<00:00:28.080> felt<00:00:28.410> like<00:00:28.500> we<00:00:28.619> should<00:00:28.800> have<00:00:28.890> won<00:00:29.099> um<00:00:31.790> it<00:00:32.790> was

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
I felt like we should have won um it was

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.080 
I felt like we should have won um it was
just<00:00:33.440> so<00:00:34.440> this<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:34.980> close<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.460> think<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.820> felt

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
just so this is so close I think I felt

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.080 
just so this is so close I think I felt
like<00:00:36.410> just<00:00:37.410> slightly<00:00:38.190> better<00:00:38.430> play<00:00:38.670> from

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
like just slightly better play from

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.600 
like just slightly better play from
everybody<00:00:40.050> would<00:00:40.260> have<00:00:40.350> just<00:00:40.530> easily<00:00:41.430> just

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
everybody would have just easily just

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.779 
everybody would have just easily just
won<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:41.850> game<00:00:41.969> so<00:00:43.010> it's<00:00:44.010> hard<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.430> say<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.640> I

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
won that game so it's hard to say that I

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.720 
won that game so it's hard to say that I
was<00:00:45.000> just<00:00:45.120> like<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.300> loss<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.989> just<00:00:46.230> felt

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
was just like a loss it just felt

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.299 
was just like a loss it just felt
probably<00:00:47.730> shoulda<00:00:47.910> won<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.739> it<00:00:49.739> sucks<00:00:50.250> to

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
probably shoulda won and it sucks to

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.840 
probably shoulda won and it sucks to
lose<00:00:50.489> games<00:00:50.760> like<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:51.020> but<00:00:52.699> Bailey's<00:00:53.699> it

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
lose games like that but Bailey's it

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.400 
lose games like that but Bailey's it
means<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.180> working<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:54.539> bed<00:00:54.719> as<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.870> team<00:00:55.170> and

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
means that working in bed as a team and

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.400 
means that working in bed as a team and
winning<00:00:56.280> even<00:00:56.820> though<00:00:57.000> our<00:00:57.329> early<00:00:57.960> game<00:00:58.140> was

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
winning even though our early game was

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.619 
winning even though our early game was
you<00:00:58.949> know<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.370> lonely<00:00:59.520> like<00:00:59.820> when<00:01:00.390> we<00:01:00.480> had<00:01:00.600> a

slight<00:01:00.930> lead<00:01:01.170> vs<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.530> huge<00:01:01.829> leader<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.280> game

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
slight lead vs a huge leader of the game

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.560 
slight lead vs a huge leader of the game
we<00:01:03.840> just<00:01:04.530> did<00:01:05.040> really<00:01:05.580> well<00:01:05.640> dragon<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.450> stuff

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
the positives away and yeah its head

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.170 
the positives away and yeah its head
curry<00:02:38.760> berkowitz<00:02:39.480> couple<00:02:39.960> guys<00:02:40.800> and<00:02:41.220> it<00:02:42.030> was

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
curry berkowitz couple guys and it was

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.240 
curry berkowitz couple guys and it was
really<00:02:42.690> filling<00:02:43.140> I<00:02:43.320> felt<00:02:43.560> really<00:02:43.620> fat<00:02:43.950> after

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
really filling I felt really fat after

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.950 
really filling I felt really fat after
that<00:02:44.400> so<00:02:44.640> that's<00:02:44.880> I<00:02:45.240> guess<00:02:45.450> that's<00:02:45.720> kind<00:02:45.900> of

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
that so that's I guess that's kind of

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.630 
that so that's I guess that's kind of
cool<00:02:46.580> so<00:02:47.580> yeah<00:02:47.730> playoffs<00:02:48.540> are<00:02:48.660> coming<00:02:48.930> up<00:02:49.080> and

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
cool so yeah playoffs are coming up and

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.770 
cool so yeah playoffs are coming up and
there's<00:02:50.640> only<00:02:50.790> two<00:02:51.000> more<00:02:51.150> weeks<00:02:51.180> left<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.630> the

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
there's only two more weeks left of the

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.530 
there's only two more weeks left of the
regular<00:02:52.770> season<00:02:53.000> after<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:54.120> it's<00:02:54.330> going<00:02:54.450> to

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
regular season after that it's going to

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.120 
regular season after that it's going to
be<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.720> playoffs<00:02:55.050> but<00:02:55.500> there's<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.740> pretty<00:02:55.920> big

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
be the playoffs but there's a pretty big

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.100 
be the playoffs but there's a pretty big
break<00:02:56.550> between<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:57.270> end<00:02:57.450> of<00:02:57.660> season<00:02:57.840> and

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
break between the end of season and

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.470 
break between the end of season and
playoffs<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:58.880> gonna<00:02:59.880> have<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.150> practice

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
playoffs so gonna have to practice

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.150 
playoffs so gonna have to practice
really<00:03:00.780> really<00:03:00.990> hard<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.530> just<00:03:01.770> get<00:03:01.950> even

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
really really hard to just get even

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.040 
really really hard to just get even
better<00:03:02.370> I<00:03:02.790> think<00:03:03.600> that<00:03:03.660> we<00:03:03.780> have<00:03:03.870> a<00:03:03.900> pretty

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
better I think that we have a pretty

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.050 
better I think that we have a pretty
good<00:03:04.140> shot<00:03:04.260> at<00:03:04.620> doing<00:03:05.040> wall<00:03:05.490> playoffs<00:03:05.850> and

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
good shot at doing wall playoffs and

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.210 
good shot at doing wall playoffs and
potentially<00:03:06.780> going<00:03:06.900> two<00:03:07.050> worlds<00:03:07.350> I'm<00:03:07.890> still

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
potentially going two worlds I'm still

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.920 
potentially going two worlds I'm still
really<00:03:08.310> confident<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:08.940> see<00:03:09.060> I<00:03:09.090> think<00:03:09.360> I<00:03:09.570> think

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
really confident and see I think I think

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.050 
really confident and see I think I think
now<00:03:10.230> that<00:03:10.290> things<00:03:10.950> are<00:03:11.100> finally<00:03:11.340> shipping<00:03:11.940> off

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
now that things are finally shipping off

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.330 
now that things are finally shipping off
for<00:03:12.210> us<00:03:12.300> and<00:03:12.540> I<00:03:12.750> think<00:03:13.440> it's<00:03:13.740> really<00:03:14.160> not<00:03:14.280> a

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
for us and I think it's really not a

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.490 
for us and I think it's really not a
week<00:03:14.520> too<00:03:14.670> soon<00:03:14.880> that<00:03:14.910> we're<00:03:15.510> finally<00:03:15.930> doing<00:03:16.140> a

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
week too soon that we're finally doing a

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.700 
week too soon that we're finally doing a
bit<00:03:16.800> better<00:03:16.830> um<00:03:18.110> but<00:03:19.110> yeah<00:03:19.230> we<00:03:19.500> can<00:03:19.620> definitely

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
bit better um but yeah we can definitely

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.280 
bit better um but yeah we can definitely
a<00:03:19.980> lot<00:03:20.130> better<00:03:20.190> still<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:20.790> I<00:03:21.750> believe<00:03:21.810> in<00:03:22.230> the

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
a lot better still and I believe in the

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.260 
a lot better still and I believe in the
potential<00:03:22.590> of<00:03:22.800> the<00:03:22.860> team<00:03:23.070> and<00:03:23.310> I<00:03:23.940> really<00:03:24.120> think

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
potential of the team and I really think

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.750 
potential of the team and I really think
that<00:03:24.390> we<00:03:24.570> can<00:03:24.800> step<00:03:25.800> it<00:03:25.950> up<00:03:26.010> me<00:03:26.160> more<00:03:26.400> and<00:03:26.640> just

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
that we can step it up me more and just

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.980 
that we can step it up me more and just
even<00:03:27.030> better<00:03:28.580> yeah<00:03:29.580> definitely<00:03:30.240> looking<00:03:30.660> this

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
even better yeah definitely looking this

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.300 
even better yeah definitely looking this
is<00:03:31.050> looking<00:03:31.230> good<00:03:31.350> though<00:03:31.530> so<00:03:31.860> I'm<00:03:32.100> happy

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
is looking good though so I'm happy

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.870 
is looking good though so I'm happy
about<00:03:32.459> that<00:03:32.580> also<00:03:34.160> next<00:03:35.160> week<00:03:35.340> we<00:03:35.520> won't<00:03:35.700> be

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
about that also next week we won't be

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.490 
about that also next week we won't be
able<00:03:35.940> play<00:03:36.180> Lucien<00:03:36.630> which<00:03:36.810> actually<00:03:37.020> had<00:03:37.230> sex

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
able play Lucien which actually had sex

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.520 
able play Lucien which actually had sex
but<00:03:38.100> he<00:03:38.220> did<00:03:38.490> get<00:03:38.670> buffed<00:03:39.120> in<00:03:39.450> a<00:03:39.750> way<00:03:39.900> where<00:03:40.200> I

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
but he did get buffed in a way where I

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.530 
but he did get buffed in a way where I
think<00:03:40.950> every<00:03:41.190> team<00:03:41.370> would<00:03:41.520> consider<00:03:42.240> him<00:03:42.360> as<00:03:42.510> a

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
think every team would consider him as a

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.460 
think every team would consider him as a
first<00:03:43.350> big<00:03:43.980> /ban<00:03:44.550> that's<00:03:45.480> pretty<00:03:45.900> annoying<00:03:46.140> to

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
first big /ban that's pretty annoying to

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.500 
first big /ban that's pretty annoying to
be<00:03:46.500> honest<00:03:46.800> just<00:03:47.040> having<00:03:47.700> Lucia's<00:03:48.060> to<00:03:48.240> be<00:03:48.330> so

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
be honest just having Lucia's to be so

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.480 
be honest just having Lucia's to be so
strong<00:03:48.840> all<00:03:49.080> of<00:03:49.170> a<00:03:49.230> sudden<00:03:49.260> and<00:03:49.740> then<00:03:49.770> having

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
strong all of a sudden and then having

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.240 
strong all of a sudden and then having
him<00:03:50.670> be<00:03:51.030> disabled<00:03:51.450> in<00:03:51.480> time<00:03:51.900> so<00:03:52.230> that's<00:03:53.010> weird

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
are a few nuances that I need to

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.170 
are a few nuances that I need to
remember<00:04:15.870> and<00:04:16.260> relearn<00:04:17.160> and<00:04:17.580> there<00:04:18.060> are<00:04:18.150> a

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
remember and relearn and there are a

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.970 
remember and relearn and there are a
couple<00:04:18.510> things<00:04:18.780> that<00:04:19.049> people<00:04:19.260> have<00:04:19.410> innovated

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
couple things that people have innovated

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.610 
couple things that people have innovated
since<00:04:20.190> then<00:04:20.370> such<00:04:21.000> as<00:04:21.180> like<00:04:21.390> a<00:04:21.560> over<00:04:22.560> eyes

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
since then such as like a over eyes

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.440 
since then such as like a over eyes
flash<00:04:22.950> instead<00:04:23.460> of<00:04:23.520> a<00:04:23.580> flash<00:04:23.790> pulverize<00:04:24.270> which

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
flash instead of a flash pulverize which

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.700 
flash instead of a flash pulverize which
is<00:04:24.600> just<00:04:24.870> faster

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
is just faster

game can't really be too sad about that

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:29.309 
game can't really be too sad about that
it's<00:05:27.370> just<00:05:27.639> sometimes<00:05:28.389> things<00:05:28.990> don't<00:05:29.139> go<00:05:29.289> well

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:29.319 
it's just sometimes things don't go well

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:32.129 
it's just sometimes things don't go well
but<00:05:30.280> sometimes<00:05:30.849> of<00:05:31.060> the<00:05:31.240> just<00:05:31.630> look<00:05:31.780> past<00:05:31.930> it

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:32.139 
but sometimes of the just look past it

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:34.320 
but sometimes of the just look past it
look<00:05:32.259> at<00:05:32.349> the<00:05:32.409> positives<00:05:33.099> and<00:05:33.280> like<00:05:34.060> I<00:05:34.150> should

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
look at the positives and like I should

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.680 
look at the positives and like I should
says<00:05:34.539> be<00:05:35.110> positive<00:05:35.800> and<00:05:36.280> see<00:05:37.270> because<00:05:37.389> then

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
says be positive and see because then

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.170 
says be positive and see because then
the<00:05:37.960> sides<00:05:38.710> like<00:05:39.009> the<00:05:39.159> film<00:05:39.400> is<00:05:39.580> negative<00:05:40.030> and

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180
