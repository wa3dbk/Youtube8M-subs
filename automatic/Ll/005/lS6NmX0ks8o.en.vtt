00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 good bye rays of this municipality 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.450
 of minecraft agrietour oil in this 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.429
 fourth episode of this series of 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.230
 minecraft with fashions 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.420
 another episode we had found here 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.299
 this kind of little house that the 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.369
 we will use mainly for deposit 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.890
 or stuff like that and also how you have it 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.769
 noticed from the screen I added also 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.890
 removed some fashions or you can already see 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.599
 an example indeed added type la 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.670
 gaydon card mod 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.949
 then others moderately fantastic then 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.600
 we will also go to do because I am 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.210
 go immediately these fashions will go to 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.329
 change the gameplay in fact ho 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.649
 also added alan etter mode really 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.480
 a fantastic way works at 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.100
 perfection so maybe so need 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.110
 we will go to prepare ourselves then maybe and 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.789
 next we will go into the ether 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.320
 therefore current of nature e 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.600
 we already have it but with only gods 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.140
 shorts and then maybe some weapons 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.090
 in fact a diamond spa if 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.859
 yet you have not understood in which series 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.530
 we will mainly go to explore 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.899
 we will not have a fixed point but a species 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.450
 to go around exploring fashions that 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.729
 there are such political errors 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.310
 added you want many, many world 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.900
 modestly advised you practically 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.150
 thank you so much for having 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.860
 recommended you are playing with the 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.200
 choosing yourself you have also advised me to 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.689
 put a texture to make everything 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.490
 less bright but with the shell is if not 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.770
 that's just how I want to put the choice 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.380
 because I like it anyway he says it's not 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.880
 notes but it would seem crisis to me anyway 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.189
 gods to empty therefore we have 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.020
 your servant really a lot of stuff 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.360
 here we can very well empty ourselves because 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.640
 so we do n't need ferret at all 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.829
 I observe here we can not directly 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.229
 we will need nothing at the end raga not 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.899
 we really found nothing 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.270
 stuff in the dungeons is missing some food that 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.420
 we still don't have too much and then 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.399
 also a bit of a shoulder to fight 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.200
 robin and is then taken we are ready 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.670
 we can also go to the meter though 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.479
 even if I give you I want to do something 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.950
 very beautiful 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.440
 a real one to go get ready 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.120
 maybe the 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.160
 obsidian to go precisely into 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.410
 nether that we still do not have then 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.330
 so we should be able to do it then 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.830
 then we have iron then 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.990
 let's go to the mine for a moment we'll do it 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.310
 a pick and now it should be known 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.260
 so we sleep 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.610
 but the notes but from the fumes but see you 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
 at your essentials 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.480
 then when she comes we will 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.410
 we bring mine maybe we can serve 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.720
 then we will bring a food solo 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.580
 obviously we consider anathemas in the mine 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.170
 to see if we find something useful 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.940
 the area of brutal lydia of these 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.500
 angel in taking the complete for 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.350
 make us another Tuscan path here 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.090
 certainly it will not be enough anyway 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.030
 I know if you've noticed, but here they are 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.100
 blurred other dong geon I don't know if mine 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.810
 impression but these are new here 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.880
 however we hope the coop is that 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.560
 merola circuit we can use 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.690
 to make us small new because not 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.010
 we have it then we end it must 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.960
 keep going back anyway 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.940
 always continue to leave many 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.040
 like because if you share joints 100 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.380
 I like it tomorrow you will have already suffered 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.000
 the episode is the episode 15 boys polegge 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.350
 very serious thing 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.090
 still nice even if you like it 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.680
 so I'm also pretty with tennis 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.080
 which I apologize for if I am not bringing it 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.180
 videos very frequently because su 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.860
 these days i've been busy 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.320
 so i'm so sorry if you don't 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.390
 anyway , that's the reason 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.550
 how I think how busy I am 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.010
 you too may be so summer then 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.510
 it's also a bit obvious how what anyway 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.920
 now it's really analyzing night 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.510
 just when I had decided to go 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.550
 anyway we go to sleep in the mine 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.830
 give it to our home 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.360
 so we sleep the door is not open 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.830
 give a damn nothing 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.870
 ah ok perfect so we dream of yours 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.820
 in the mine maybe taio cruz childbirth but not 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.280
 I know it depends if I find it suffered from the mine 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.840
 new cut or else cut suffered because 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.269
 I don't want to waste your time 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.940
 useless part that beautiful the savannah 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:50.180
 that is, they were standing at the bog it looks like 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.220
 vomit in the middle of a beautiful fortress 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.230
 the effect collected about twelve pieces of 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.420
 I think iron will be enough 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.430
 certainly with the books 15 between us 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.830
 immediately a beautiful perfect furnace here 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.600
 here we take the step for the crisis in 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.940
 we put the wall on blackwater 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.320
 unfortunately we have no own coal 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.120
 I have not found it 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.080
 I hate that Rome's weird place texture 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.180
 type lights up the house 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.590
 beautiful also the effect then me 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.660
 he called to cook this iron then 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.660
 just then maybe we need to find gods 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.180
 find diamonds of obsidian and then 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.430
 rushed to promise you that we will go into the 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.780
 network will show you a little as 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.700
 greater to this time than I assure you 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.180
 which is made really well closes 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.230
 only a little to load anyway yes 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.180
 download fairly quickly from 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.070
 contacts that there is no network of 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.870
 minecraft edition so it will take a lot 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.810
 really to put really beautiful 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.030
 so then here he put it to cook the 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.910
 iron so we take it immediately and there 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.040
 let's drop the iron pickaxe 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.330
 persecutory we're going to dig gods 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.400
 diamonds if we find it 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.140
 and then we'll do more with the neumanns for 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.090
 collect obsidian for certain 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.220
 kids something absurd to record 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.620
 here closes the postal pomegranate well for 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.910
 the latinensi because then comes like casinos 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.980
 of cars passing a stuff of 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.080
 I kind of have to stay here to choke 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.790
 it was just unbearable below 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.740
 dripping from the forehead if you too 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.900
 you are dripping from the forehead write 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.940
 hashtag I'm also dripping like sid 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.250
 to which iron is proceeding then 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.260
 oh well we will certainly try 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.310
 even a sword coffin what we are less at 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.050
 full 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.520
 he had a good weapon then the forces in 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.919
 more where we can go perfectly 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.540
 in the let her these here immediately defined 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.669
 here they are a bit limp as an episode that 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.490
 I apologize however history this video there 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:32.460
 the same ok closes the crash was missing 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.050
 the boys did not have the final rush 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.910
 we took off the class so we are 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.080
 happy so hopefully this video 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.650
 sorry we don't want the today 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.650
