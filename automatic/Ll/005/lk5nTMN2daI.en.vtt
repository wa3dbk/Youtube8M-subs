watching<00:01:09.740> this<00:01:09.830> video<00:01:10.160> and<00:01:10.490> that<00:01:10.640> guy<00:01:10.820> just

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
watching this video and that guy just

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.790 
watching this video and that guy just
jumped<00:01:11.390> across<00:01:11.510> buildings<00:01:11.990> so<00:01:12.290> I<00:01:12.320> decided<00:01:12.710> to

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
jumped across buildings so I decided to

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.609 
jumped across buildings so I decided to
jump<00:01:12.979> across<00:01:13.130> but<00:01:13.610> he<00:01:13.670> didn't<00:01:13.850> work<00:01:14.410> and<00:01:15.410> then

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
jump across but he didn't work and then

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.680 
jump across but he didn't work and then
I<00:01:15.740> just<00:01:15.920> end<00:01:16.070> up<00:01:16.190> dying<00:01:16.490> or<00:01:16.940> not<00:01:17.000> dying<00:01:17.479> well

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
I just end up dying or not dying well

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.570 
I just end up dying or not dying well
there's<00:01:17.900> blood<00:01:18.170> all<00:01:18.200> over<00:01:18.320> my<00:01:18.500> face<00:01:18.740> and<00:01:18.770> and

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
there's blood all over my face and and

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.370 
there's blood all over my face and and
if<00:01:20.270> you're<00:01:20.420> not<00:01:20.570> a<00:01:20.600> vampire<00:01:20.810> you<00:01:21.140> probably

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
if you're not a vampire you probably

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.020 
if you're not a vampire you probably
don't<00:01:21.560> like<00:01:21.590> blood<00:01:21.920> in<00:01:22.070> your<00:01:22.160> face<00:01:22.369> if<00:01:22.820> you<00:01:22.910> are

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
don't like blood in your face if you are

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.520 
don't like blood in your face if you are
then<00:01:23.360> you're<00:01:23.510> a<00:01:23.540> freak<00:01:23.900> and<00:01:24.200> you<00:01:24.380> should

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
then you're a freak and you should

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.930 
then you're a freak and you should
probably<00:01:24.680> not<00:01:24.860> be<00:01:24.920> watching<00:01:25.280> my<00:01:25.369> videos<00:01:25.700> but

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
probably not be watching my videos but

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.310 
probably not be watching my videos but
whatever<00:01:26.180> I<00:01:26.420> don't<00:01:26.780> know<00:01:26.840> what<00:01:26.930> I'm<00:01:27.020> talking

so<00:01:28.490> I<00:01:28.520> really<00:01:29.119> like<00:01:29.270> favela<00:01:29.660> at<00:01:29.840> this<00:01:29.990> point<00:01:30.229> in

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
so I really like favela at this point in

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.680 
so I really like favela at this point in
time<00:01:30.530> and<00:01:30.830> the<00:01:31.040> space<00:01:31.100> time<00:01:31.820> continuum<00:01:32.030> mainly

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
time and the space time continuum mainly

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.510 
time and the space time continuum mainly
because<00:01:32.840> it's<00:01:33.229> such<00:01:33.440> a<00:01:33.470> closed<00:01:33.860> and<00:01:34.100> congested

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
because it's such a closed and congested

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.310 
because it's such a closed and congested
map<00:01:34.670> like<00:01:34.940> people<00:01:35.360> like<00:01:35.510> this<00:01:35.660> just<00:01:35.900> sit<00:01:36.140> here
