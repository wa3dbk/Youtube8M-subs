00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
times in spite of the fact that i don't

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.880 
times in spite of the fact that i don't
like<00:00:38.010> in<00:00:38.399> principle<00:00:39.590> anabolic<00:00:40.940> bodybuilders

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
like in principle anabolic bodybuilders

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.660 
like in principle anabolic bodybuilders
the<00:00:43.890> fact<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.610> somebody<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.590> anabolic

and<00:01:20.790> yachts<00:01:22.759> were<00:01:23.990> perfect<00:01:25.670> bodybuilders<00:01:26.670> as

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
and yachts were perfect bodybuilders as

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.090 
and yachts were perfect bodybuilders as
for<00:01:27.360> their<00:01:27.630> training<00:01:28.340> methods<00:01:29.360> as<00:01:30.360> for

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
for their training methods as for

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.999 
for their training methods as for
education<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.189> young<00:01:32.670> people<00:01:33.390> who<00:01:33.900> wanted<00:01:34.710> to

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
education of young people who wanted to

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.560 
education of young people who wanted to
start<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:36.119> train<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:37.460> it's<00:01:38.460> only<00:01:38.880> because<00:01:39.150> of

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
start the train and it's only because of

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.950 
start the train and it's only because of
one<00:01:39.930> important<00:01:40.710> thing<00:01:40.979> they<00:01:41.430> had<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.119> perfect

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
one important thing they had a perfect

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.719 
one important thing they had a perfect
technique<00:01:44.210> nearly<00:01:45.210> full<00:01:45.509> movements<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.729> just

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
technique nearly full movements and just

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.600 
technique nearly full movements and just
protecting<00:01:48.570> their<00:01:48.810> talents<00:01:49.380> but<00:01:50.040> otherwise

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
protecting their talents but otherwise

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.609 
protecting their talents but otherwise
let's<00:01:51.329> say<00:01:51.600> 80%<00:01:52.880> movement<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.149> not<00:01:54.750> like<00:01:55.350> we

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
let's say 80% movement and not like we

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.569 
let's say 80% movement and not like we
see<00:01:55.920> today<00:01:56.689> both<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.990> them<00:01:58.290> they<00:01:59.070> were<00:01:59.130> putting

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
see today both of them they were putting

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.319 
see today both of them they were putting
action<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.689> fact<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:02.399> negative

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
action to the fact that the negative

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.160 
action to the fact that the negative
movement<00:02:03.659> is<00:02:04.380> as<00:02:05.180> important<00:02:06.180> as<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.600> positive

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
movement is as important as the positive

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.420 
movement is as important as the positive
movement<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:08.750> that<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.170> tempo<00:02:10.860> in<00:02:11.160> an

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
movement and that the tempo in an

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.080 
movement and that the tempo in an
exercise<00:02:11.790> in

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
exercise in

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.580 
exercise in
the<00:02:13.180> building<00:02:13.599> is<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:14.260> decisive<00:02:14.980> factor

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
the building is a decisive factor

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.390 
the building is a decisive factor
because<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:18.400> negative<00:02:18.700> movement<00:02:19.420> if<00:02:20.110> you<00:02:20.470> do

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
because the negative movement if you do

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.800 
because the negative movement if you do
for<00:02:21.700> example<00:02:23.040> press<00:02:24.040> for<00:02:24.430> shoulders<00:02:25.090> the

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
for example press for shoulders the

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.759 
for example press for shoulders the
negative<00:02:26.379> movement<00:02:26.970> must<00:02:27.970> be<00:02:28.180> at<00:02:29.080> least<00:02:29.590> at

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
negative movement must be at least at

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.070 
negative movement must be at least at
the<00:02:29.799> same<00:02:30.099> speed<00:02:30.549> as<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.970> positive<00:02:31.510> movement

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
the same speed as the positive movement

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.360 
the same speed as the positive movement
it's<00:02:32.590> like<00:02:33.010> an<00:02:33.400> Jean<00:02:33.879> in<00:02:34.209> the<00:02:34.510> car<00:02:34.840> so<00:02:35.769> it<00:02:36.069> never

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
it's like an Jean in the car so it never

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
it's like an Jean in the car so it never
stops

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
stops

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.960 
stops
you<00:02:37.870> don't<00:02:38.230> do<00:02:38.590> like<00:02:39.569> hop<00:02:40.769> you<00:02:41.769> stay<00:02:42.099> there<00:02:42.519> for

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
you don't do like hop you stay there for

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.030 
you don't do like hop you stay there for
two<00:02:43.870> seconds<00:02:44.379> and<00:02:44.530> go<00:02:44.830> down<00:02:45.160> no<00:02:45.970> you<00:02:46.390> go<00:02:46.660> all

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
two seconds and go down no you go all

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.960 
two seconds and go down no you go all
the<00:02:48.040> time

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
the time

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.360 
the time
in<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.510> same<00:02:49.840> tempo<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:50.799> the<00:02:51.310> muscle<00:02:51.849> is

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
in the same tempo and the muscle is

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.789 
in the same tempo and the muscle is
really<00:02:54.370> weren't<00:02:54.790> up<00:02:55.150> during<00:02:56.049> the<00:02:56.200> exercise

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
really weren't up during the exercise

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.630 
really weren't up during the exercise
and<00:02:57.569> these<00:02:58.569> two<00:02:58.840> bodybuilders<00:02:59.620> we're<00:03:00.370> using

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
and these two bodybuilders we're using

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.100 
and these two bodybuilders we're using
this<00:03:01.000> system<00:03:01.569> in<00:03:01.780> a<00:03:01.959> perfect<00:03:02.760> way<00:03:04.110> because

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
this system in a perfect way because

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.559 
this system in a perfect way because
they<00:03:05.290> understood<00:03:05.769> that<00:03:06.160> they<00:03:06.579> destroyed<00:03:07.299> the

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
they understood that they destroyed the

you are under doing you can be not

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.920 
you are under doing you can be not
enough<00:05:37.950> excited<00:05:38.950> and<00:05:39.160> the<00:05:39.370> training<00:05:39.850> has<00:05:40.210> not

enough excited and the training has not

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.620 
enough excited and the training has not
the<00:05:41.080> same<00:05:41.320> value<00:05:41.680> at<00:05:41.890> the<00:05:42.010> end<00:05:42.040> I<00:05:42.610> think<00:05:43.210> the

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
the same value at the end I think the

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.080 
the same value at the end I think the
training<00:05:44.140> was<00:05:44.350> the<00:05:44.380> right<00:05:44.830> weight<00:05:45.130> in<00:05:45.400> a<00:05:45.760> right

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
training was the right weight in a right

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.140 
training was the right weight in a right
number<00:05:46.510> of<00:05:46.870> reps<00:05:47.260> and<00:05:47.530> right<00:05:48.130> number<00:05:48.640> of<00:05:48.670> sets

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
number of reps and right number of sets

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.480 
number of reps and right number of sets
is<00:05:49.420> the<00:05:49.600> best<00:05:49.960> way<00:05:50.290> to<00:05:50.320> get<00:05:50.680> excited<00:05:51.220> in<00:05:51.340> the

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490
