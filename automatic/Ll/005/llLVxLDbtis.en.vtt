00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 listen and now we go to who 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.680
 we go to djokovic and djokovic and who has 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.269
 beat rafael nadal 1 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.840
 that was it in the semifinal so at 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.549
 carl rather dryly enough 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.740
 dryly he beat her so is 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.510
 today we have the feeling that it is 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.670
 may have become unavoidable 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.050
 djokovic is much less roland garros 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.640
 Well, he's the big favorite we go 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.230
 go find benoît maylin so on the 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:35.219

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:40.710
 screen and luc table non boyoud boy y 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:44.309
 believed and clean everything emptied there 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.710

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.879

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:54.840
 of tetanus 1 who if they wanted to break 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:01:00.210
 and then ten lambs know and you 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:03.180
 French you were very happy to 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.430
 2009 we were late others he has 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.600
 lost once where a choice of all his 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.330
 career at roland garros against 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.280

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.250

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.600

 video bikoko that I have the french 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.520
 had enough times the number uno 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:32.060
 which premises djokovic has since since 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:36.450
 since roland garros last year 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:39.240

 that it is that these themes yesterday will win 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.270
 link he won a tour have for 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.689
 theme all the local world early in buenos 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.350
 areas where there was nobody that 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.810
 jankovic 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.740
 since roland garros last year he has 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:02.490
 won 23 top 10 out of the 25 he goes 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.280
 or and he loses twice against the king 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.430
 cantona 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:10.209
 and lose a lot while the guardian 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.760
 back he has beaten a top 10 since 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:17.230
 roland garros a top 10 for ten months 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:20.920
 digoin this shit it's fucking ihome 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.080
 food and jankovic game anti camelots and 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.930
 makes them win more to see her since 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.900
 2012 he will never make it to roland 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.540
 garros is screwed except that yoko matches 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.760
 local life they had to earn roland 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.300
 garros last year also here at the level 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.820
 1 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.600
 he had beaten rafa in the tournament final 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.989
 from Rome 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.380
 1 so that's it he went to win roland 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.630
 garros 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.400
 yann area and then well he loved 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.250

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.850
 dung with a double foul on the ball 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.840
 match 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.370
 thundered there are people there two years yoko life 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.040
 if they had to win roland garros 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.000
 because he had beaten rafa already to 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.600
 Monte Carlo 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.250
 1 it had been eight years since the end he 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.709
 did not lose to monte carlo ago 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.720
 two years and the tax that led the 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.670
 battle is he gone to win 1 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.769
 but he did not win they did not 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.480
 won he had besides loti made a 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.000
 beautiful blues remember in the 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.860
 fifth set in semifinal in 2013 la 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.260
 police were taken there in the 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:26.799
 net 1 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:28.930
 and in 2012 it was the third time in 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.910
 final consecutively in tournaments 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.519
 of the grand slam and jankovic who was beating 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.040
 nadal at wimbledon at the us open in 2011 and 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.630

 he realigned wii game in the third 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.420
 set 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.570
 he had made the break at the beginning of the 15th 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:50.079
 may he had lost common moves and one 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.829
 Launière not me he should tch 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.630

 lost to rent when we laughed 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.859
 federer in the semi final 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.390
 because it's all on clay 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:09.910
 clay is not the surface 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.580

 kovic 10 on clay is not even 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.000
 20% 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:23.080
 rafa it's forty six tournaments on 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.930
 clay on 64 70 % clay 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.420

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.960
 sense and there who lives again it will be true 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:37.300
 generates and we wash where we see it goes up 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:39.370
 carlo the place called iba isner 2h20 first 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.250

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.620
 and after that it's true on Saturday in 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.840
 semifinal it lacks solid against 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.320
 yokomichi father but the yoko fast they 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.450
 were affected 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.320
 he had a lot of trouble beating berdych 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.660
 finally 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.330
 he was physically touched roland 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:01.450

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:08.590
 month he will be ready rafa he is never 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:11.290
 as dangerous as when he is in 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:14.620
