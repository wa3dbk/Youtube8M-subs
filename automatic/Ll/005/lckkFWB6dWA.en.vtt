00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
you have the two mouse button so you

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.200 
you have the two mouse button so you
could<00:01:49.280> actually<00:01:49.400> be<00:01:49.610> mousing<00:01:50.060> and

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
could actually be mousing and

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.000 
could actually be mousing and
keyboarding<00:01:50.990> at<00:01:51.080> the<00:01:51.200> same<00:01:51.380> time<00:01:51.560> which<00:01:51.800> i

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
keyboarding at the same time which i

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.650 
keyboarding at the same time which i
thought<00:01:52.220> was<00:01:52.430> ultra<00:01:52.850> cool<00:01:53.060> but<00:01:53.540> you<00:01:53.570> know

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
thought was ultra cool but you know

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.840 
thought was ultra cool but you know
we've<00:01:53.870> come<00:01:54.050> a<00:01:54.080> long<00:01:54.170> way<00:01:54.530> and<00:01:54.770> you<00:01:55.280> know<00:01:55.370> 25

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
we've come a long way and you know 25

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.940 
we've come a long way and you know 25
years<00:01:56.090> later<00:01:56.180> toshibas<00:01:57.050> got<00:01:57.230> their<00:01:57.680> latest

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
years later toshibas got their latest

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.530 
years later toshibas got their latest
technology<00:01:58.520> out<00:01:58.640> and<00:01:58.820> that's<00:01:59.150> one<00:01:59.270> of<00:01:59.300> the<00:01:59.450> big

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
technology out and that's one of the big

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.370 
technology out and that's one of the big
things<00:01:59.690> about<00:01:59.930> them<00:02:00.080> they're<00:02:00.200> always

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
things about them they're always

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.200 
things about them they're always
innovating<00:02:01.010> and<00:02:01.220> really<00:02:01.760> pushing<00:02:02.120> the

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
innovating and really pushing the

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.450 
innovating and really pushing the
envelope<00:02:02.240> this<00:02:02.900> is<00:02:03.050> the<00:02:03.140> Tekra<00:02:03.670> r700

and<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:10.350> is<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.740> sweet<00:02:11.160> laptop<00:02:11.340> it's<00:02:11.880> got<00:02:12.120> all

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
and this is a sweet laptop it's got all

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.810 
and this is a sweet laptop it's got all
the<00:02:12.570> power<00:02:12.780> yet<00:02:13.440> it's<00:02:13.650> incredibly<00:02:14.370> light<00:02:14.610> and

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
the power yet it's incredibly light and

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.490 
the power yet it's incredibly light and
small<00:02:15.150> you<00:02:15.420> can<00:02:15.570> have<00:02:15.959> a<00:02:15.990> look<00:02:16.170> here<00:02:16.380> you<00:02:16.440> can

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
small you can have a look here you can

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.370 
small you can have a look here you can
see<00:02:16.590> how<00:02:16.860> thin<00:02:17.100> it<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:18.110> it's<00:02:19.110> hard<00:02:19.320> to

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
see how thin it is and it's hard to

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.960 
see how thin it is and it's hard to
believe<00:02:19.650> but<00:02:19.920> you<00:02:20.130> know<00:02:20.220> it's<00:02:20.370> very<00:02:20.610> sturdy

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
believe but you know it's very sturdy

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.630 
believe but you know it's very sturdy
but<00:02:21.240> it's<00:02:21.480> so<00:02:21.780> light<00:02:22.020> it's<00:02:22.200> coming<00:02:22.440> in<00:02:22.530> at<00:02:22.640> 1.45

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
but it's so light it's coming in at 1.45

but it's so light it's coming in at 1.45
kilograms<00:02:24.240> well<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.510> same<00:02:24.660> weight<00:02:24.810> is<00:02:24.900> in

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
kilograms well the same weight is in

kilograms well the same weight is in
that<00:02:25.170> book<00:02:25.320> it<00:02:25.800> will<00:02:25.950> exactly<00:02:26.370> but<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:26.760> have

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
that book it will exactly but you have

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.240 
that book it will exactly but you have
all<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.209> power<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.870> see<00:02:28.050> inside<00:02:28.590> there<00:02:28.920> using

pretty<00:02:36.630> well<00:02:36.810> everything<00:02:37.260> that<00:02:37.860> Windows

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
pretty well everything that Windows

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.770 
pretty well everything that Windows
computing<00:02:38.700> allows<00:02:38.910> today<00:02:39.239> you<00:02:39.510> know<00:02:39.600> one<00:02:39.750> of

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
computing allows today you know one of

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.300 
computing allows today you know one of
the<00:02:39.870> things<00:02:39.989> I<00:02:40.080> liked<00:02:40.260> about<00:02:40.350> it<00:02:40.530> was<00:02:41.070> the

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
the things I liked about it was the

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.130 
the things I liked about it was the
screen<00:02:41.640> size<00:02:41.910> if<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.270> look<00:02:42.450> at<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.600> side

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
screen size if you look at the side

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.420 
screen size if you look at the side
profile<00:02:43.620> there<00:02:43.830> you'll<00:02:43.980> see<00:02:44.130> that<00:02:44.250> it's

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
profile there you'll see that it's

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.190 
profile there you'll see that it's
razor-thin<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.390> one<00:02:45.750> of<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.900> ways<00:02:46.020> they're

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
razor-thin and one of the ways they're

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.810 
razor-thin and one of the ways they're
getting<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.680> that<00:02:46.770> is<00:02:46.920> using<00:02:47.190> LED<00:02:47.610> technology

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
getting to that is using LED technology

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.120 
getting to that is using LED technology
but<00:02:48.360> what<00:02:48.510> that<00:02:48.660> gives<00:02:48.930> you<00:02:49.260> is<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:49.860> gives<00:02:50.010> you

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
but what that gives you is it gives you

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.160 
but what that gives you is it gives you
a<00:02:50.160> nice<00:02:50.310> bright<00:02:50.730> clear<00:02:51.120> screen<00:02:51.540> but<00:02:51.959> it<00:02:52.050> also

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
a nice bright clear screen but it also

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.960 
a nice bright clear screen but it also
cuts<00:02:52.560> down<00:02:52.680> on<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.040> size<00:02:53.250> which<00:02:53.580> helps<00:02:53.850> the

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
cuts down on the size which helps the

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.400 
cuts down on the size which helps the
weight<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.360> also<00:02:54.810> helps<00:02:55.020> with<00:02:55.110> battery

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
weight and also helps with battery

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.229 
weight and also helps with battery
consumption<00:02:55.830> as<00:02:56.070> well<00:02:56.250> battery<00:02:56.820> life<00:02:56.940> on<00:02:57.090> this

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
consumption as well battery life on this

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.030 
consumption as well battery life on this
unit<00:02:57.570> is<00:02:57.630> quite<00:02:57.900> long<00:02:58.110> you'll<00:02:58.350> get<00:02:58.470> seven<00:02:58.920> to

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
unit is quite long you'll get seven to

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.830 
unit is quite long you'll get seven to
eight<00:02:59.220> hours<00:02:59.610> of<00:02:59.760> battery<00:03:00.030> life<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.360> you<00:03:00.720> know

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
eight hours of battery life and you know

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.900 
eight hours of battery life and you know
with<00:03:00.989> all<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:01.380> power<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:02.010> how<00:03:02.130> tiny<00:03:02.610> it<00:03:02.850> is

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
with all that power and how tiny it is

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.280 
with all that power and how tiny it is
you're<00:03:03.120> always<00:03:03.450> worried<00:03:03.720> about<00:03:03.780> things<00:03:04.050> like

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
you're always worried about things like

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.290 
you're always worried about things like
overheating<00:03:04.920> well<00:03:05.280> in<00:03:05.459> telling<00:03:05.700> toshiba<00:03:06.120> have

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
overheating well in telling toshiba have

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.759 
overheating well in telling toshiba have
developed<00:03:06.720> some<00:03:06.870> airflow<00:03:07.110> cooling

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
developed some airflow cooling

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.620 
developed some airflow cooling
technology<00:03:08.340> that<00:03:08.700> helps<00:03:08.850> dissipate<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.510> heat

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
technology that helps dissipate the heat

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.180 
technology that helps dissipate the heat
from<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.200> notebook<00:03:10.380> so<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:10.709> don't<00:03:10.890> have<00:03:11.040> to

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
from the notebook so you don't have to

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.680 
from the notebook so you don't have to
worry<00:03:11.370> about<00:03:11.519> that<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:12.120> that's<00:03:12.420> one<00:03:12.570> of<00:03:12.630> the

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
worry about that and that's one of the

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.970 
worry about that and that's one of the
things<00:03:12.750> is<00:03:13.019> that<00:03:13.080> you<00:03:13.410> know<00:03:13.500> where<00:03:13.680> you<00:03:13.769> rest

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
things is that you know where you rest

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.830 
things is that you know where you rest
your<00:03:14.100> palms<00:03:14.430> on<00:03:14.820> the<00:03:14.850> laptop<00:03:15.299> is<00:03:15.420> typically

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
your palms on the laptop is typically

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.479 
your palms on the laptop is typically
where<00:03:16.080> it<00:03:16.140> gets<00:03:16.230> quite<00:03:16.530> hot<00:03:16.739> especially<00:03:17.400> with

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
where it gets quite hot especially with

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.520 
where it gets quite hot especially with
something<00:03:17.670> like<00:03:17.820> an<00:03:18.060> i7<00:03:18.209> processor<00:03:18.959> in<00:03:19.080> it<00:03:19.170> but

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
something like an i7 processor in it but

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.140 
something like an i7 processor in it but
you<00:03:19.620> don't<00:03:19.769> feel<00:03:19.980> that<00:03:20.250> with<00:03:20.400> this<00:03:20.580> well<00:03:21.000> the

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
you don't feel that with this well the

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.069 
you don't feel that with this well the
neat<00:03:21.269> thing<00:03:21.450> is<00:03:21.540> they're<00:03:21.660> using<00:03:21.930> some

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
neat thing is they're using some

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:23.539 
neat thing is they're using some
honeycomb<00:03:22.320> technology<00:03:23.130> in<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.340> actual

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
honeycomb technology in the actual

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.610 
honeycomb technology in the actual
structure<00:03:23.970> here<00:03:24.299> so<00:03:24.570> it<00:03:24.900> helps<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.350> keep<00:03:25.470> it

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
structure here so it helps to keep it

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.500 
structure here so it helps to keep it
light<00:03:25.860> but<00:03:26.310> at<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.519> same<00:03:26.730> time<00:03:26.970> keeps<00:03:27.390> it

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
light but at the same time keeps it

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.729 
light but at the same time keeps it
rigid<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:27.989> you<00:03:28.049> don't<00:03:28.200> have<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.380> worry<00:03:28.590> about

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
rigid so you don't have to worry about

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.440 
rigid so you don't have to worry about
the<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.340> notebook<00:03:29.640> bending<00:03:30.030> which<00:03:30.180> is<00:03:30.420> a

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
the the notebook bending which is a

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.910 
the the notebook bending which is a
problem<00:03:31.320> because<00:03:31.380> you<00:03:31.530> don't<00:03:31.680> want<00:03:31.829> the

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
problem because you don't want the

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.860 
problem because you don't want the
motherboard<00:03:32.340> bending<00:03:33.090> it's<00:03:33.750> also

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
motherboard bending it's also

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.840 
motherboard bending it's also
upgradeable<00:03:34.380> to<00:03:34.410> a<00:03:34.530> 320<00:03:35.190> gigabyte<00:03:35.549> hard<00:03:35.730> drive
