00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.540
 hello everyone I'm kid we're on 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.839
 new in a new video today I bring you 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:10.299
 something different is a reflection 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.669
 lately I am very very thoughtful 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:14.980
 in the previous productivity video os 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:17.200
 ghafar I was already reflecting that not 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.000
 I had something the game that I 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.620
 it was happening that it was not a scab 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.510
 normal the new earlier than british 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.620
 it did not happen to me in this one that happened to me 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.770
 that when I was a couple of hours 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.530
 playing I got bored and showed 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.770
 various zeal because I'm getting him 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:35.740
 a lot of quiet or not, that's why I started 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.150
 see the previous ones that I'm going to teach 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.770
 during videos the tools the 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.870
 statistics that I have of the works and 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.280
 all that and well I'm going to ask you 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.500
 stay until the end of the video because 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.390
 let's talk about this time that 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.890
 we spent playing high louboutin me 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.180
 would like to reflect on this and that 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:54.160
 you too reflect now 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:56.770
 reflect and reflections forgiveness and 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.050
 think about this as we can see I'm going to 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:03.970
 put here the statistics of 2 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:06.400
 warfare took 13 days 2 hours and 38 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:11.050
 minutes and good in the prestige 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:15.880
 prestige 25 this the prestige 25 I have 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:18.610
 a rate of 163 ratio will defeat 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.310
 wins is pretty bad as it will happen 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.540
 something if we enter the multiplayer and go 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:28.090
 to see the statistics that I have 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.429
 let's see if I put it 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.010
 I do not have the hand the hand is worth a 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:35.220
 thing that is already recorded that I did 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:39.940
 and well here we can see that I have 19 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.190
 days played 14 hours 6 minutes and 33 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:48.760
 second seconds rituals mother one 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:50.550
 rate of 1.47 473 if you want in kilos and 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.380
 the favorite man I had in the 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.000
 booster to the remington then the truth 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.370
 is that I have 19 days but they are saying 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.440
 knees very well used in that yes 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.420
 that I did not get bored because I had to 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.670
 very well and I knew a lot of people 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.410
 people I am playing with them now and 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.630
 here we see the white these that was 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.750
 when it started on my channel let's say my 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.240
 channel started on 22 when I already had 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.490
 I think he already had the most of our 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.970
 prestige and I started there the channel I started 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.340
 with some other and some other 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.150
 departure the 2 campers started high 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:29.350
 campers we can see that I have here 21 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.150
 9 hours and 40 minutes plus 26 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:35.410
 seconds the centers are going to leave 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:38.320
 apart a rate of 123 a positive rate 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.120
 still here this game the truth that is 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.430
 for me the toy 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.040
 white is 2 was the boom the boom of 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.770
 the call of duty is the one that more 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.400
 good take off from the beginning let's go 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:54.310
 to move on to the owner of guÃ¡jar 3 let's see 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.020
 the statistics of the hours if it is charged 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.080
 this 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.090
 here we can see that he no longer had the 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.920
 symbol of youtube because here still 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.560
 had not started had a kitten had 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.720
 the flag of Spain and the BCA clan that 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.150
 it was the typical clan that we have all 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.780
 the friends here from my town here 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.900
 I have 6 days 18 hours and 9 minutes here 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.630
 you have seen that they are not the same 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.100
 hours that I have thrown now when it starts 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.410
 the channel the truth that they started to 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.390
 ravage the hours 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.190
 but you solbes as an amount because 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.840
 I lied to a lot of cane to the games 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.080
 the good thing about average I do not put a lot 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:35.110
 of cane we go to whites 1 this game the 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.470
 you're going to be a little freaked out 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.870
 with the statistics that I have since the 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.570
 statistics is pretty bad enough 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.250
 because for me the black ops the 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.380
 confirmed it was the worst game for me 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.160
 you can see that I only have 3 days 12 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.440
 52 minutes and a rate without having 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.460
 active is the worst rate I can have 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.530
 I in a game that is 0.69 we recorded it 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:03.190
 to modern warfare 2 that this game 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.860
 I also liked it very much already 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.590
 that I started recently I had started 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.740
 to play with the play because I the first 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.930
 I bought especially to play at 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.940
 call of duty and let's see the rate that 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.930
 I have here here I still did not have 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:23.729
 no prestige teacher 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:25.740
 13 days 16 hours and 34 minutes the scarce 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:28.289
 death rate I think it was a bit 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.570
 also in negative and here I had you 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:33.240
 to put this introduced since this 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.889
 game thanks to this game I bought the 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.620
 play and I bought the flip precisely 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:39.930
 for this game were left I think few 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.870
 months to leave him the modern 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.210
 warfare 2 and I bought from play 3 of 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.979
 second hand with this game post for 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.949
 to be able to play it because I got tainted 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:52.620
 much the case of my other friend not 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:56.400
 started a lot to this game I wore 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.169
 in the 4 world and I said oysters I can not 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.970
 be thinking about going home to my 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.139
 friend play if I do not want to have it in my 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.740
 house someone completely 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:06.750
 efe specifically play 3 for 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.490
 play this game we can see that 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.650
 only says do not get to the first 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.440
 prestige I stayed with level 75 not 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.780
 I wanted to go because if nothing is going to get out 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.360
 the next game because I'm not interested 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.220
 start making the prestige and here 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.500
 I think I have if I'm not mistaken 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.230
 memory I have three days here I have 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:28.320
 youtube youtube 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:31.050
 later when I entered a day 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:34.900
 when I run it to play here I have 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:37.630
 3 days and 10 hours played 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.270
 and to see here slow king when I already 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:43.720
 I imposed thinking our three days three 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:47.919
 days 19 days 20 hours million very many 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:50.949
 good and I have chosen a one sheet with one 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:54.160
 sheet pointed all the hours that I've 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:58.030
 played the call of duty and I've put 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:00.280
 here to the uve some white two to manu 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:04.210
 lighthouse 3 - tip of the whole I have done the sum 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:06.880
 and I do not know if you're going to be left 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:11.020
 little so I know that a lot of people will have 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:15.220
 more secure but borders there are 81 days in 12 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:17.590
 hours and 50 minutes 81 days of my life I 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:21.370
 is organized by playing al 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:23.650
 louboutin but is that I feel and one day is 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:27.039
 that for me this is what you have navigating 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:29.919
 to god all god strong 81 days I shot 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:32.919
 almost three months playing the play without 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:35.349
 without taking off better it equals 6 to almost 3 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:36.789
 months when to play without taking off or 

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:37.900
 to go to piss neither to eat nor to 

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:39.759
 sleep 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.070
 how incredible the truth the hours the 

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:44.770
 amount of what we can throw 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:48.729
 face for a console because I know that 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:53.069
 I this is 82 days but 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:57.330
 the mobile is a barbarity 

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:59.740
 I do not know how many days you will have this 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.569
 outrageous and nothing wanted only 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.849
 reflect on this from the works that 

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:05.770
 we throw our faces the call of duty or 

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:07.659
 other games because the card also 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:10.089
 lie a lot of days in total we 

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:11.589
 we will surely have thrown all the 

00:07:10.089 --> 00:07:15.879
 world will have been thrown away and a whole year 

00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:17.589
 when to him so gta produced data game 

00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:19.749
 a weapon the campaign modes that that has 

00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:21.689
 counted so little more than a year we have 

00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:24.879
 all the players of 

00:07:21.689 --> 00:07:27.430
 pc consoles of anything nothing of some 

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:28.270
 which I have been sent for thinking 

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.710
 reconsider 

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.719
 I would like to know what you think 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:34.210
 about this on this subject the hours that 

00:07:31.719 --> 00:07:37.719
 we went to computer channel for pc 

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:41.169
 shell every console every mobile what 

00:07:37.719 --> 00:07:44.319
 be playing games you say 

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:46.539
 down leave work a comment with 

00:07:44.319 --> 00:07:48.189
 what you already think to see if we can go to 

00:07:46.539 --> 00:07:49.990
 talk a little about this topic and nothing like 

00:07:48.189 --> 00:07:51.490
 always a greeting to all and even the 

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:55.199
 next 

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:55.199
 with a smile because we see
