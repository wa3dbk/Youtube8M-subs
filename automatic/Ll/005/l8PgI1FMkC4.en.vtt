protein<00:01:47.520> crisps<00:01:48.329> it's<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.869> crunchy<00:01:49.710> protein

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
protein crisps it's a crunchy protein

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.179 
protein crisps it's a crunchy protein
bar<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.689> just<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.840> regular<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.829> regular

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
bar and just the regular the regular

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.690 
bar and just the regular the regular
protein<00:01:53.399> bar<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:54.420> with<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.750> protein<00:01:55.200> bar<00:01:55.700> this

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
protein bar so with the protein bar this

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.399 
protein bar so with the protein bar this
one<00:01:56.909> has<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.360> most<00:01:57.479> calories<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.290> it's

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
one has the most calories in it it's

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.490 
one has the most calories in it it's
about<00:01:58.619> 290<00:01:59.460> calories<00:01:59.640> now<00:02:00.509> for<00:02:00.719> me<00:02:00.840> I'm<00:02:01.079> really

protein bar has 9 grams which is also
nothing<00:04:05.740> which<00:04:06.740> and<00:04:06.980> it<00:04:07.070> comes<00:04:07.310> from

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
nothing which and it comes from

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.560 
nothing which and it comes from
sweeteners<00:04:09.800> which<00:04:10.040> is<00:04:10.400> let<00:04:10.880> me<00:04:10.910> actually

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
sweeteners which is let me actually

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.750 
sweeteners which is let me actually
bring<00:04:11.720> that<00:04:11.840> up<00:04:12.020> there<00:04:12.650> sucralose<00:04:13.250> in<00:04:13.610> these

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
bring that up there sucralose in these

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.570 
bring that up there sucralose in these
now<00:04:14.240> sucralose<00:04:15.170> isn't<00:04:15.770> the<00:04:16.359> best<00:04:17.470> sweetener

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
now sucralose isn't the best sweetener

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.320 
now sucralose isn't the best sweetener
but<00:04:19.580> it<00:04:19.910> is<00:04:20.120> the<00:04:20.420> last<00:04:20.870> ingredient<00:04:21.500> in<00:04:22.400> this
