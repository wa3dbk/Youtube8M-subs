00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.470
 So today I would be a cool 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.120
 drink and it's amazing 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.410
 Although we have a killer air conditioning here 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.820
 However, I did not have them 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.170
 all the time because I have fresh air 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.130
 That's why I want to have it now 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.220
 why do I have to suffer 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.590
 my problem it was a bit like that 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.359
 a day that stood in the sign of the nexus 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.220
 I know you give him an extra for 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.420
 day I filmed I can not 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.710
 he does not show us with the periscope 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.150
 I'm a proud owner 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.449
 a nexus 5 and keep putting 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.859
 if I have great new test equipment 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.360
 over a longer period of time, I'm glad 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.860
 then again on nexus five 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.050
 go back and today I'm still one 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.489
 little bit because google is something quite 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.110
 Great has announced and two 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.050
 got it, it's just this 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.190
 stage fried fried so the stage 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.079
 Fried fear the fear of these 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.039
 competition called exploit around the one 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.600
 Security hole in android now 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.460
 almost all of them turned up for me 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.190
 equipment affects because it applies to all 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.739
 Android versions since 22 folio occurs 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.930
 and in the face of this fear and the contrary 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.399
 those work on google pages 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.690
 manufacturer pages and also from the provider 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.449
 google now has pages 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.519
 we will all nexus from now on 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.260
 devices monthly with security updates 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.310
 supply that's good news there 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.229
 Of course I'm happy about it 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.340
 These are not feature updates than you 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.780
 now we can expect the nexus 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.100
 device he owns that somehow each 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.210
 month just got new features it 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.250
 actually goes to close by 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.750
 security gaps frank knocking behind 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.040
 just for fun ok at the place and for me as 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.570
 Lexus owner is a fine thing 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.150
 and a reason more me on the 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.770
 next nexus devices to be happy and there 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.939
 joins now equal to the arc 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.390
 the second message 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.650
 the next so 6 2015 so we suspect that 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.939
 It means we do not know yet like that 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.430
 is final hot so we tend to go 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.079
 of two devices from the google im 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.369
 october, then it is in october faith 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.270
 I will introduce in october 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:48.420
 a little nexus 5 september october like that 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.009
 late summer early autumn a little one 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.509
 small nexus five successor of well 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.000
 is built by lg again and one 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.040
 larger nexus 64 bit successor of 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.810
 huawei is to be built for the first time and 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.700
 this huawei fed has become now 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.659
 presumably in a very short time 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.430
 video showed that there are only a few 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.540
 for a second, I am also honest 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.729
 said a bit irritated if that 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.170
 now really the upcoming nexus 6 is 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.940
 or if somehow completely different is involved 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.110
 only the film was filmed the back sees 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.430
 a bit like this cover from the 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.319
 nexus 5 the one week 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.819
 was created so look at this 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.530
 make your own picture if that 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.329
 actually the upcoming nexus six 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.290
 As I said before, I could be skeptical 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.150
 but we did not want it for you 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.870
 withheld so did not have now 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.980
 already stage fried mentions all the world 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.569
 the whole mobile world is terrified 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.260
 before stage continue cycling also right 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.389
 This is relative 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.909
 a relatively threatening relative 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:34.200
 threatening exploit or what you 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.909
 can do it if you just angry 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.139
 thinks and yesterday we had the message 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.459
 The telecom now has in Germany 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:40.739
 ever the automatic download of 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.269
 ms files are not disabled with that 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.299
 we can recommend to get in 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.230
 anyway if you really recommend 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.909
 We basically do not do it if you are 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.889
 the user sms app turns on the 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:51.239
 automatic download from mms 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:52.439
 you usually get similar to that 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.359
 only when you get one is it 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:55.919
 probably the exploit or a hack 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.719
 exploit on this and then the 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:03:00.090
 automatically, so to speak, that mail web 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:01.379
 so download and turn off 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.919
 Now they all work as mentioned 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.969
 high pressure on it and basically the 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:07.919
 ask if it is the next interesting 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:09.359
 days with patches roll out if afterwards the 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:10.530
 problem is fixed on your device and 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.730
 there are now two apps for this we have 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.439
 now first found both by 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.750
 from security company that is one 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:17.129
 from lookout the other is from us 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.599
 That's the imperium I believe that 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.729
 are those who have discovered themselves 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.470
 or because now somehow priority 

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:24.569
 work to close this gap 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.859
 and the two apps are both called stage 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.540
 and detector gives to the place times have 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.959
 we linked in the article and thus can 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.430
 You check if you are getting smaller 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.799
 It is said in English so receptive 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.209
 for the touchpad is at the moment 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.250
 So they are the are not irritated 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.840
 if the message changes then but 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.859
 if you are rolled out in patches 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.090
 you can with the apps again 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.040
 check the gap now 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.780
 Closed or is your device always there 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.459
 still open so that gives a bit 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.859
 then maybe just because you're easy 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.889
 knows how the status of your own device 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:54.389
 there is that way I am through that was the 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.770
 We have news otherwise I have 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:58.860
 forget something 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:02.160
 Martin I'm disappointed because I always 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.410
 spokesman posed nexus 6 is actually 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.570
 no matter what, forget our readers 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.310
 to tell our spectators the farm in 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:12.390
 Seminar 16 is outside you heard 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.880
 that was only in 3d graphics is you can 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.470
 wonderful agriculture forestry 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.980
 with his own tractor you can 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.710
 drive over the fields 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:26.250
 sugar cane carrots yes wheat even too 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.740
 Of course, the carrots are not straight 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.180
 android disgusting from the 6 8 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.300
 see you tomorrow again until then 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.300
 bye
