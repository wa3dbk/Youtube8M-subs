GoPro<00:00:30.070> doesn't<00:00:30.400> sell<00:00:30.669> it<00:00:30.849> so<00:00:31.060> I<00:00:31.089> thought<00:00:31.359> I'd

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
GoPro doesn't sell it so I thought I'd

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.410 
GoPro doesn't sell it so I thought I'd
try<00:00:31.810> to<00:00:32.080> make<00:00:32.349> one<00:00:32.590> and<00:00:33.180> this<00:00:34.180> is<00:00:34.270> what<00:00:34.390> it

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
try to make one and this is what it

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:41.340 
try to make one and this is what it
looks<00:00:34.570> like<00:00:34.750> um<00:00:35.080> I<00:00:36.690> took<00:00:37.690> a<00:00:40.110> square<00:00:41.110> piece<00:00:41.320> of

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
looks like um I took a square piece of

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.450 
looks like um I took a square piece of
hardened<00:00:41.800> would<00:00:43.680> it's<00:00:44.680> like<00:00:44.860> four<00:00:45.190> board

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
hardened would it's like four board

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.510 
hardened would it's like four board
would<00:00:45.760> and<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:47.260> cut<00:00:47.800> a<00:00:47.829> hole<00:00:48.160> through<00:00:48.190> the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
would and I cut a hole through the

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.000 
would and I cut a hole through the
center<00:00:48.760> show<00:00:49.239> this<00:00:49.420> this<00:00:50.289> pole<00:00:50.620> could<00:00:50.800> fit

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
center show this this pole could fit

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.770 
center show this this pole could fit
through<00:00:51.280> and<00:00:51.520> then<00:00:52.480> I<00:00:52.600> cut<00:00:52.960> it<00:00:53.079> in<00:00:53.140> half

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
through and then I cut it in half

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.810 
through and then I cut it in half
drilled<00:00:55.780> two<00:00:56.140> holes<00:00:56.170> in<00:00:56.980> it<00:00:57.160> right<00:00:57.370> there

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
drilled two holes in it right there

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.180 
drilled two holes in it right there
there<00:00:58.420> what<00:00:59.079> three<00:00:59.350> holes<00:00:59.559> right<00:00:59.800> there<00:01:00.010> there

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.420 
there what three holes right there there
and<00:01:00.219> there<00:01:00.430> I<00:01:00.820> put<00:01:01.809> one<00:01:03.449> big<00:01:04.449> bolt<00:01:04.750> through<00:01:05.080> it

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
and there I put one big bolt through it

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.690 
and there I put one big bolt through it
with<00:01:06.430> one<00:01:06.700> um<00:01:06.940> a<00:01:08.009> wing<00:01:09.009> nut<00:01:09.189> on<00:01:09.369> it<00:01:09.400> so<00:01:10.060> I<00:01:10.530> can

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
with one um a wing nut on it so I can

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.100 
with one um a wing nut on it so I can
twist<00:01:12.700> it<00:01:12.939> on<00:01:13.950> slide<00:01:14.950> it<00:01:15.130> on<00:01:15.310> and<00:01:15.549> off<00:01:16.110> like

that and keep it on that just tighten it

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.990 
that and keep it on that just tighten it
up<00:01:23.320> and<00:01:24.780> that's<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:26.140> piece<00:01:26.409> that<00:01:26.770> goes<00:01:27.460> on<00:01:27.820> so

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
up and that's the piece that goes on so

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:41.990 
up and that's the piece that goes on so
its<00:01:28.180> casing<00:01:33.899> this<00:01:34.899> is<00:01:35.079> chasing

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
was the the clip mount it would clip

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.660 
was the the clip mount it would clip
into<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:07.770> thing<00:02:08.100> right<00:02:08.280> here<00:02:09.200> and<00:02:10.459> that<00:02:11.459> goes

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
this is how it works I there's three I

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:38.360 
this is how it works I there's three I
took<00:02:31.160> one<00:02:32.209> rod<00:02:33.209> I<00:02:33.239> guess<00:02:33.720> of<00:02:34.310> aluminum<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:37.370> don't

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
took one rod I guess of aluminum I don't

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.800 
took one rod I guess of aluminum I don't
know<00:02:38.670> it's<00:02:39.209> called<00:02:39.800> aluminum<00:02:41.450> stick<00:02:42.450> or

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
know it's called aluminum stick or

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.020 
know it's called aluminum stick or
whatever<00:02:43.340> it's<00:02:44.340> like<00:02:44.520> just<00:02:44.640> take<00:02:44.850> a<00:02:44.880> little

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
whatever it's like just take a little

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.920 
whatever it's like just take a little
square<00:02:45.450> piece<00:02:46.160> that<00:02:47.160> I<00:02:47.190> think<00:02:47.489> they're

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
square piece that I think they're

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.890 
square piece that I think they're
one-eighth<00:02:48.930> or<00:02:50.570> yeah<00:02:51.570> one-eighth<00:02:52.100> inch

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
one-eighth or yeah one-eighth inch

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.410 
one-eighth or yeah one-eighth inch
pieces<00:02:54.900> that<00:02:55.380> I<00:02:55.410> cut<00:02:55.739> put<00:02:56.640> three<00:02:56.940> in<00:02:57.060> so<00:02:57.299> they

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
pieces that I cut put three in so they

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.229 
pieces that I cut put three in so they
could<00:02:57.600> fit<00:02:57.870> into<00:02:58.080> this<00:02:58.410> I<00:02:58.790> put<00:02:59.790> like<00:02:59.970> there's

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
could fit into this I put like there's

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.240 
could fit into this I put like there's
two<00:03:00.480> of<00:03:00.510> them<00:03:00.630> with<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.590> third<00:03:01.860> one<00:03:02.070> in<00:03:02.160> the

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
two of them with the third one in the

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.250 
two of them with the third one in the
middle<00:03:02.430> so<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:02.760> make<00:03:02.880> this<00:03:03.060> gap<00:03:03.450> that<00:03:04.080> fits

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
middle so to make this gap that fits

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.039 
middle so to make this gap that fits
onto<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.590> GoPro<00:03:04.950> mount<00:03:05.239> and<00:03:06.239> I<00:03:06.600> just<00:03:06.750> tighten

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
onto the GoPro mount and I just tighten

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:13.690 
onto the GoPro mount and I just tighten
that<00:03:07.110> on<00:03:07.320> and<00:03:07.590> then<00:03:07.680> I<00:03:07.769> go<00:03:07.950> down<00:03:08.209> I<00:03:10.670> put<00:03:11.670> on<00:03:11.790> the

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
that on and then I go down I put on the

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.850

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
it pulls down a little bit but you get

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.110

used<00:03:48.959> to<00:03:49.079> it<00:03:49.280> works<00:03:50.280> just<00:03:50.520> like<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:50.760> one<00:03:50.970> the

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
the end it's kind of hard to get on but

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.970 
the end it's kind of hard to get on but
I<00:03:56.940> takes<00:03:57.660> it<00:03:57.780> so<00:03:57.959> it<00:03:58.080> doesn't<00:03:58.230> rip<00:03:58.620> my<00:03:58.770> mount
