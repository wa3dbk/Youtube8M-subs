 To all of you is Manoel Bertone from the website hitting 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.460
 as we are in the early days of the 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.340
 year 2015 and I wanted to start with 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.340
 thank the entire community that has 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:17.039

 Continue to support us and why we 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.119
 We will do our best to continue. 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.460
 to do what we really like 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.400
 which is to speak and show as express that 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.070
 I think I wanted to share with you. 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.940
 marcelo site launch just pt.com 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.980
 is the new book with 25 items for the piece 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.719
 which I get in the video two will 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.620
 to share with you one of the 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:46.140
 existed in the e-book back how do 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.579
 who wants access to the tanks and have 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.969
 free ego access 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.789
 only have to register my goal was 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.590
 weekly sbt site dot how will it 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.750
 automatically a link to perform the 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.270
 free download of e book with 25 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.370
 teams in today's market, let's 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:07.920
 need three things our samples 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:10.140
 one thousand injured and one blue and one instructor 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.330
 one of the problems with some prizes in 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.799
 but who with the Sunday show is 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.689
 the fact that each time we learn only 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.360
 I think it's the show is constantly 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:22.409
 up the line this should be due to the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.960
 that we can not learn to use it in the 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.430
 Today's spout let's do is precisely 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.710
 show how we got to arrest 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:37.460
 any sample of vinyl in any 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:39.000
 solve it before you return the node 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:51.720
 from the cane 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:52.740
 let's go the fan is more 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.479
 comfortable 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.479
 I personally prefer to use an ointment 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.110
 can see our channel on facebook she 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.399
 there is a detailed explanation as to 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:09.420
 that are made in another video that was 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:12.270
 done by brother rodrigo I'll have to 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.660
 make the way of the node that won the 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.660
 other side 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:27.330
 it is 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.330
 I only cut French 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:44.099
 and then with this assembly 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:49.799
 conquer here now let's apply the 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:51.900
 sample is currently used by one or 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:55.109
 knows as well as the new notes that the 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.430
 Senate is one soon you will stay 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:59.939
 to know more about it 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.739
 I hope I can share with you. 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:05.549
 the test results will determine the 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.750
 to do let's say he sees the impact 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:12.019
 it's normal 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:19.590
 we missed spying the show 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:22.379
 We turn around and now before you 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:29.359
 show and compute an impact let's 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:29.359
 passing the destroyer by the vehicle leaked 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:36.230
 or let's do 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:48.560
 Ok let's go back and it will stay like this 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:51.709
 Why are you going to build this? 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.709
 will be stuck here in this speech that 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:58.310
 the back and will prevent the sample 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:01.370
 rise at the end every time we have a country 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:08.120
 then just take one just like we do 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:12.079
 normally on the five keys and we have the 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:16.160
 White advantage hopes you like to 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:19.250
 more tips like these regions not right 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.070
 hit the website hit common point and can 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.180
 have access to return to the cast of 25 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.180
 vehicles for practicing
