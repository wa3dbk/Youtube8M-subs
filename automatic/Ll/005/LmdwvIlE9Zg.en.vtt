00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.009
 Allofs labels Simoni IT here in the last two days 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:07.399
 I have completely sealed off from everyone it means I have mine 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:10.700
 Phone off I turned off internet 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.829
 and I do not have him 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:17.390
 completely and all the other victims moved for the simple reason that I am 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.649
 Project has a very big project that he is 20 11 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.660
 and the coming year 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.080
 I want to completely change that means I want myself personally 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.809
 I want to change the relationship with other people I want 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:35.719
 in the fitness area maybe better achievements and also in the 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:37.170
 business 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.570
 and all Harry tried in that he seemed to divide the steps 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.310
 called 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.340
 I once have the business private relationships with other people 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.530
 and the gym and my personality of course and have that 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.379
 all taken to the test 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.449
 that means I was wondering 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.489
 How can I change that completely to become a better person? 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:02.910
 How can I change myself personally? 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.970
 yes make better contacts with other people and so on and the whole 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.310
 I can also miss you 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.120
 made incredible progress I've seen concrete steps now 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.920
 where i want to go and all i have learned by being out of mine 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.210
 It's very important to work on fitness 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.130
 and I can recommend it to you 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.259
 if now known to the few people that they really 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.890
 want to tell massive progress in their lives 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.500
 most people do not set goals and then wonder why they are 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.130
 first average 10 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.149
 and I recommend if really want to be above average 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.550
 you want to build more muscle than the other turn more successes have nothing 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.729
 as the others, I am now busy myself set goals 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.030
 One year is the London Times can be up to the question is what is 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.270
 that means 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.140
 if you are game-wise 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.630
 Want to create 500 kilos of bench press 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.820
 then the whole thing is to divide up the palm joy on the weeks basis 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.150
 Heavy example 

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:14.130
 for example, it could be to try adding on a daily basis 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.240
 not permanently good to feed 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.240
 I try to go to training three times a week 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:23.209
 to optimize other muscle groups specifically for bench press 

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:28.609
 Although this means play the shoulder in the triceps and so on they try to 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:32.239
 Optimize Attempt to get a lead role and get me on this 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.249
 Wonder Thilo to focus 

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:38.650
 and if you really set a main goal then you will realize it will always be 

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:41.299
 come closer to this goal if you have it 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:42.730
 on a daily basis 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.590
 and has called and I really put it to the heart 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.179
 these different areas have important office 

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:52.229
 Write down Google first at the end of next year 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.560
 and if it really goes through when it is subdivided into the daily goal then you will 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.960
 you remember that the year 2011 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.839
 there will be a year 

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:06.720
 I have given you a small suggestion that the year 2011 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.240
 home via value and I wish you a beautiful face every year 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.499
