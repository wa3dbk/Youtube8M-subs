then<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.550> know<00:00:50.610> what<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.300> extrema<00:00:51.899> know

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
then is you know what is extrema know

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.290 
then is you know what is extrema know
what<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.860> do<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.660> so<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:54.870> on<00:00:55.340> Xtreme<00:00:56.340> NO<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.879> a

what to do and so on on Xtreme NO is a

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.540 
what to do and so on on Xtreme NO is a
nickel<00:00:57.629> oxide<00:00:57.960> supplement<00:00:58.440> hence<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.980> n.o<00:00:59.309> in

take something like extrema no prior to
your<00:01:05.670> workout<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.270> then<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.479> go<00:01:06.600> hit<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.869> gym

your blood vessels expanding dilating
you<00:01:17.790> know<00:01:17.880> getting<00:01:18.119> bigger<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.810> as<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.350> result

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
you know getting bigger and as a result

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.060 
you know getting bigger and as a result
greater<00:01:21.270> or<00:01:21.630> more<00:01:21.840> blood<00:01:22.380> greater<00:01:22.650> amounts<00:01:22.979> of

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
greater or more blood greater amounts of

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.160 
greater or more blood greater amounts of
blood<00:01:23.159> can<00:01:23.460> be<00:01:23.490> pumped<00:01:23.970> into<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.330> muscle<00:01:24.689> so

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
blood can be pumped into the muscle so

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.200 
blood can be pumped into the muscle so
that<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.500> get<00:01:25.680> greater<00:01:26.040> pumps<00:01:26.460> now<00:01:26.850> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
that you get greater pumps now the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.149 
that you get greater pumps now the
greater<00:01:27.450> pumps<00:01:28.020> then<00:01:28.560> are<00:01:28.710> going<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.890> lead<00:01:29.130> to

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
greater pumps then are going to lead to

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.980 
greater pumps then are going to lead to
increased<00:01:29.759> endurance<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.479> increased

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
increased endurance and increased

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.590 
increased endurance and increased
recovery<00:01:31.759> you<00:01:32.759> know<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> lot<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.090> people<00:01:33.420> think

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
recovery you know a lot of people think

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.359 
recovery you know a lot of people think
about<00:01:33.780> greater<00:01:34.170> pumps<00:01:34.530> building<00:01:34.920> muscle<00:01:35.250> and

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
about greater pumps building muscle and

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.760 
about greater pumps building muscle and
that's<00:01:36.060> not<00:01:36.270> always<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.540> case<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:37.409> know<00:01:37.530> but

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
that's not always the case you know but

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.530 
that's not always the case you know but
how<00:01:37.920> do<00:01:37.979> greater<00:01:38.579> pumps<00:01:38.939> help<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.420> know

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
how do greater pumps help you you know

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.210 
how do greater pumps help you you know
what<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.810> this<00:01:39.990> stuff<00:01:40.140> do<00:01:40.350> well<00:01:40.590> when<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.070> can

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
what is this stuff do well when you can

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.700 
what is this stuff do well when you can
get<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.460> greater<00:01:41.880> pump<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.840> means<00:01:43.110> more<00:01:43.350> blood

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
get a greater pump that means more blood

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.499 
get a greater pump that means more blood
can<00:01:43.920> come<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.310> muscle<00:01:44.670> when<00:01:45.030> more<00:01:45.210> blood

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
can come to the muscle when more blood

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.700 
can come to the muscle when more blood
can<00:01:45.689> come<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.049> muscle<00:01:46.350> it's<00:01:46.500> going<00:01:46.649> to

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
can come to the muscle it's going to

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.429 
can come to the muscle it's going to
bring<00:01:46.950> number<00:01:47.340> one<00:01:47.549> more<00:01:48.060> oxygen<00:01:48.659> with<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.079> to

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
bring number one more oxygen with it to

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.139 
bring number one more oxygen with it to
the<00:01:49.560> muscle<00:01:49.920> that's<00:01:50.250> what<00:01:50.520> leads<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.880> the

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
the muscle that's what leads to the

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.550 
the muscle that's what leads to the
greater<00:01:51.360> endurance<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.320> can<00:01:52.439> work

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
greater endurance so that you can work

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.380 
greater endurance so that you can work
out<00:01:52.740> longer<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.220> harder<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.700> at<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.240> same

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
out longer and harder and at the same

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.630 
out longer and harder and at the same
time<00:01:54.659> it's<00:01:55.170> going<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.380> bring<00:01:55.560> other<00:01:55.829> essential

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
time it's going to bring other essential

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.399 
time it's going to bring other essential
nutrients<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.630> muscle<00:01:58.020> that's<00:01:58.170> going<00:01:58.350> to

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
nutrients to the muscle that's going to

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.920 
nutrients to the muscle that's going to
allow<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.710> repair<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.549> regrow<00:02:00.390> faster
