00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:16.000
 afternoons 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:17.950

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.990
 I'm very serious I say look 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.529
 reason 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.980
 How about watching today we're going to make a flan 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:25.980

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.510
 and I'm going to dedicate it 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.280
 my brother-in-law javi who is married to me 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:42.030
 sister merceditas because if there is someone 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:46.010
 who likes this coffee plan is to me 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:50.010
 brother in law or if it is sold with a coffee flan 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.929
 so I dedicate it to him 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.269
 I do not think about the ball for days 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:56.070
 I'm not going to dedicate for her the 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:59.190
 next week it's holy week 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.560
 ok then let's start let's go 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.100
 start with the ingredients 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:08.370
 a moment a moment that I have to give 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.060
 a few words to my designer 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:15.570
 of aprons and suits because this one 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.060
 would enter wax for the fair of the fair 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.920
 for the Andalusia party 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.370
 but did not arrive in time so I 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.370
 like today 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.420
 Well, hello to my sister-in-law and continue 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.440
 doing to me 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.080
 outfits 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.390
 we go there ingredients 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.710
 the caramel for the flan that I already 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.710
 I have done to overtake 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.080
 two teaspoons of sugar 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:52.400
 make plans these can devour 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:56.870
 to buy is to make eight plans 8 10 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:01.220
 because we are going to put a liter of cream 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:03.290
 cream for desserts and julito veis 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.840
 that do not debate quietly there is no 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.840
 beat and a cup of coffee 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:15.010
 I already have it done I do it with water 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:18.430
 I have made coffee that you have machine 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.269
 great so let's go there as well 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.269
 we have the cake 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.459
 let's put it to the tica 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.340
 let's add 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.720
 the preparation to make plans and 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.720
 let's go around 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.770
 today we are going to make a few simple 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.410
 fast comfortable 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.080
 and that I already tell the coffee growers 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.420
 love 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.420
 that is a few people do not like 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.650
 you have to do it in the cold you have to join it 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:08.019
 all right 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.019
 we are going to also throw the sugar 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:21.069
 that you do not have much sugar I know for me 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:24.219
 Friend Patricia from Seville 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.690
 and then Alberto there my message in 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:28.950
 Youtube 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.950
 and doctor here 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:39.250
 that she to fight so much sugar I think 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.530
 that there is also one that prepare those 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.260
 plans that do not take much sugar but 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.090
 I do not remember what metro is 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.590
 a time to find out the stays and 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.020
 sure you find it in the 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.250
 supermarkets clear and now we're going to 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.250
 add the coffee 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:04.280
 Let's go there 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.280
 and how happy I am if you knew 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:15.269
 but today 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.269
 another thing less 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.570
 well let's be a ratico like that but 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.570
 not much 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.200
 so I believe when you are no longer going 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.510
 because that noise is prepared flan 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.510
 when there is no gas 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.000
 Let's see 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:42.460
 Right 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:47.120
 we took it to where to the fire and what 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:50.050
 we put in the normal fire 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.050
 to warm up 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.870
 and spinning it 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.480
 and I'll tell you one thing 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.470
 it spins 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.660
 but you can not let him do 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.510
 bubbles because then we annoy the 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:12.060
 coffee flan 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:15.210
 then you go around and when you see 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:19.400
 that begins to do you remove it from the 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:22.610
 fire of agreement is removed from the fire 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:27.889
 this is removed from the fire and thrown into the 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:33.050
 Flanera of agreement then see you in 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:34.729
 little time let's go we're going 58 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.740
 minutes well I think I've had 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:38.750
 look already started to make bubble area 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.960
 in the time stack 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.830
 let's put it 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.830
 candy 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.320
 now 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:57.669
 if it's going to be 

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:57.669
 And if you do not ask GaviÃ±o 

00:05:59.049 --> 00:06:02.259
 If that 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:06.240
 but from there a little bit 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:13.470
 like computers 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.470
 default 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:19.620
 well we put it to be tempered and 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:23.419
 when tempered 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.419
 we keep it in the fridge 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.920
 and then when it's cold to eat 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.710
 exquisite those who have already tried it 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:33.590
 made by me you know that it is delicious and 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.660
 those who do not try it soon I see you 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:38.450
 when we turn around so you can see 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.630
 that smells for everyone is worth 

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.630
 then 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:46.980
 I'm here 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:50.060
 with the super coffee flan that what I've 

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:52.440
 fact is to throw a little bit of flakes of 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:55.140
 chocolate the grass we see that I like 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:57.830
 bending everything I like to decorate life 

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.830
 decorate everything 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.470
 brother in law 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:10.360
 but since you're not in Cordoba tomorrow 

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.819
 from villanueva 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:16.590
 and that they come to see me the good thing 

00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:16.590
 offer but to your health
