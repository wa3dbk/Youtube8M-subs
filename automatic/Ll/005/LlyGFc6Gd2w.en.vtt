the<00:02:06.370> electronics<00:02:06.910> and<00:02:07.410> we're<00:02:08.410> just<00:02:08.530> very

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
the electronics and we're just very

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.280 
the electronics and we're just very
excited<00:02:09.190> about<00:02:09.220> it<00:02:09.519> responsible<00:02:10.290> you

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
excited about it responsible you

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.170 
excited about it responsible you
mentioned<00:02:11.620> some<00:02:11.769> changes<00:02:12.190> to<00:02:12.459> the<00:02:12.610> line<00:02:12.819> some

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
mentioned some changes to the line some

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.309 
mentioned some changes to the line some
minor<00:02:13.390> changes<00:02:13.540> that<00:02:13.840> you've<00:02:13.959> already<00:02:14.110> made

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
minor changes that you've already made

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.649 
minor changes that you've already made
now<00:02:14.709> that<00:02:14.920> CAS<00:02:15.550> in<00:02:15.760> Peavey's<00:02:16.120> possession<00:02:16.540> can

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:16.659 
now that CAS in Peavey's possession can

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:17.940 
now that CAS in Peavey's possession can
you<00:02:16.750> tell<00:02:16.930> me<00:02:17.019> a<00:02:17.050> little<00:02:17.170> bit<00:02:17.440> about<00:02:17.590> some<00:02:17.920> of

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
you tell me a little bit about some of

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.130 
you tell me a little bit about some of
those<00:02:18.129> yeah<00:02:18.550> we<00:02:19.239> didn't<00:02:19.450> change<00:02:19.569> a<00:02:19.750> lot<00:02:19.930> we

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
those yeah we didn't change a lot we

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.140 
those yeah we didn't change a lot we
wanted<00:02:20.349> to<00:02:20.409> keep<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.709> formula<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:21.910> way<00:02:22.030> it

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
wanted to keep the formula the way it

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.800 
wanted to keep the formula the way it
was<00:02:22.300> mostly<00:02:22.840> but<00:02:23.110> we<00:02:23.200> did<00:02:23.410> change

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
was mostly but we did change

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.030 
was mostly but we did change
couple<00:02:24.020> of<00:02:24.080> things<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.410> neck<00:02:24.620> pitch<00:02:24.890> has

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
couple of things the neck pitch has

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.190 
couple of things the neck pitch has
actually<00:02:25.370> been<00:02:25.520> changed<00:02:25.849> a<00:02:25.940> bit<00:02:26.150> to<00:02:26.810> lower<00:02:26.989> the

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
actually been changed a bit to lower the

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.729 
actually been changed a bit to lower the
action<00:02:27.680> and<00:02:28.209> also<00:02:29.209> we're<00:02:29.660> gonna<00:02:29.959> introduce<00:02:30.290> a

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
action and also we're gonna introduce a

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.710 
action and also we're gonna introduce a
narrow<00:02:31.130> neck<00:02:31.430> version<00:02:31.880> of<00:02:32.060> some<00:02:32.569> of<00:02:32.660> the

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
narrow neck version of some of the

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.990 
narrow neck version of some of the
models<00:02:33.110> as<00:02:33.260> well<00:02:33.440> because<00:02:33.890> different<00:02:34.700> styles

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
models as well because different styles

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.630 
models as well because different styles
of<00:02:35.090> playing<00:02:35.270> require<00:02:36.260> different<00:02:36.650> setups<00:02:37.370> and

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
of playing require different setups and

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.460 
of playing require different setups and
this<00:02:38.180> is<00:02:38.300> not<00:02:38.420> a<00:02:38.450> guitar<00:02:38.630> that<00:02:38.840> you<00:02:39.080> you<00:02:39.440> really

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
this is not a guitar that you you really

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.259 
this is not a guitar that you you really
set<00:02:39.950> up<00:02:40.160> from<00:02:40.489> a<00:02:40.580> standpoint<00:02:40.790> of<00:02:40.910> moving<00:02:41.209> the

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
set up from a standpoint of moving the

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.870 
set up from a standpoint of moving the
neck<00:02:41.420> around<00:02:42.220> for<00:02:43.220> instance<00:02:43.489> we<00:02:43.610> do<00:02:43.730> have

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
neck around for instance we do have

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.990 
neck around for instance we do have
different<00:02:44.300> size<00:02:45.340> saddles<00:02:46.340> that<00:02:46.489> you<00:02:46.700> can<00:02:46.849> put

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
different size saddles that you can put

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.479 
different size saddles that you can put
in<00:02:47.090> here<00:02:47.120> so<00:02:47.900> if<00:02:48.019> you<00:02:48.170> prefer<00:02:48.470> a<00:02:48.650> higher<00:02:48.980> action

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
in here so if you prefer a higher action

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.130 
in here so if you prefer a higher action
you<00:02:49.580> can<00:02:49.730> do<00:02:49.819> it<00:02:49.970> if<00:02:50.330> you<00:02:50.360> prefer<00:02:50.750> a<00:02:50.780> low<00:02:50.930> action

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
you can do it if you prefer a low action

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.770 
you can do it if you prefer a low action
you<00:02:51.290> can<00:02:51.380> do<00:02:51.470> that<00:02:51.590> as<00:02:51.680> well<00:02:51.830> and<00:02:52.360> but<00:02:53.360> both<00:02:53.630> on

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
you can do that as well and but both on

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.780 
you can do that as well and but both on
that<00:02:53.810> I<00:02:54.140> mean<00:02:54.290> we<00:02:54.410> really<00:02:54.590> kept<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.310> formula

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
that I mean we really kept the formula

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.110 
that I mean we really kept the formula
true<00:02:56.630> to<00:02:56.840> what<00:02:56.989> ca<00:02:57.230> had<00:02:58.100> produced<00:02:58.400> because<00:02:58.670> you

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
true to what ca had produced because you

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.460 
true to what ca had produced because you
know<00:02:59.239> if<00:02:59.299> it's<00:02:59.420> not<00:02:59.569> it's<00:02:59.930> not<00:03:00.080> broken<00:03:00.290> don't

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
know if it's not it's not broken don't

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.900 
know if it's not it's not broken don't
fix<00:03:00.560> it<00:03:00.970> now<00:03:01.970> ca<00:03:02.360> isn't<00:03:02.989> the<00:03:03.170> only<00:03:03.670> leaps<00:03:04.670> and

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
fix it now ca isn't the only leaps and

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.630 
fix it now ca isn't the only leaps and
bounds<00:03:05.269> that<00:03:05.500> PB<00:03:06.500> is<00:03:06.590> taking<00:03:06.980> into<00:03:07.459> the

first of all remember how

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.110 
first of all remember how
uncharacteristically<00:03:18.950> heavy<00:03:19.670> that<00:03:19.880> he<00:03:19.910> were

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
uncharacteristically heavy that he were

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.940 

I'll<00:03:55.150> keep<00:03:55.510> the<00:03:55.600> light<00:03:55.750> green<00:03:56.050> if<00:03:56.320> I<00:03:56.470> want<00:03:56.740> to

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
I'll keep the light green if I want to

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.510 
I'll keep the light green if I want to
have<00:03:57.880> more<00:03:58.210> compression<00:03:58.810> then<00:03:59.710> I<00:04:00.040> get<00:04:00.370> it

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
have more compression then I get it

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.900 
have more compression then I get it
you'll<00:04:00.970> see<00:04:01.090> it<00:04:01.180> going<00:04:01.270> to<00:04:01.360> yellow<00:04:04.890> so<00:04:05.890> in<00:04:06.340> that

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
you'll see it going to yellow so in that

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.760 
you'll see it going to yellow so in that
way<00:04:07.150> what<00:04:07.570> you<00:04:07.720> can<00:04:07.870> do<00:04:08.020> is<00:04:08.200> I<00:04:08.290> can<00:04:08.350> be<00:04:08.500> playing

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
way what you can do is I can be playing

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:14.100 
way what you can do is I can be playing
a<00:04:09.040> normal<00:04:12.000> if<00:04:13.000> I<00:04:13.090> want<00:04:13.210> to<00:04:13.270> go<00:04:13.330> into<00:04:13.450> a<00:04:13.510> solo<00:04:13.930> I

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
a normal if I want to go into a solo I

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:20.070 
a normal if I want to go into a solo I
hit<00:04:14.350> the<00:04:14.500> boost<00:04:14.920> button<00:04:18.630> and<00:04:19.630> it's<00:04:19.780> gonna<00:04:19.840> give

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
hit the boost button and it's gonna give

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.539 
hit the boost button and it's gonna give
me<00:04:20.109> that<00:04:20.260> compression<00:04:20.830> so<00:04:20.980> that<00:04:21.010> my<00:04:21.220> notes

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
me that compression so that my notes

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.180 
me that compression so that my notes
will<00:04:22.150> actually<00:04:22.450> hold<00:04:22.600> out<00:04:22.810> and<00:04:23.110> I<00:04:23.410> can<00:04:23.590> stand

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
will actually hold out and I can stand

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.890 
will actually hold out and I can stand
out<00:04:24.310> in<00:04:24.400> the<00:04:24.460> mix<00:04:24.670> so<00:04:25.300> that's<00:04:25.540> a<00:04:25.630> really<00:04:25.870> really

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
out in the mix so that's a really really

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.100 
out in the mix so that's a really really
cool<00:04:26.170> feature<00:04:26.440> it's<00:04:26.680> a<00:04:26.710> non<00:04:26.920> clipping<00:04:27.400> circuit

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
cool feature it's a non clipping circuit
