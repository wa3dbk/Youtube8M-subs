 As I mentioned earlier, 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.070
 Because it is a policy that short-term water enters

 From the beginning 

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:43.259
 It's the second time in 6th, there's almost no difference. 

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:46.839
 All. It's accurate. 

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:54.419
 In the form of a slide,

 For the reason, 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.489
 Does it include the military? 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.739
 Have you heard enough of May? 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.389
 Once in a lifetime 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:44.389
 Let me try to solve it. If it's harder, is it enough? 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.579
 Can it be a center of defense with no polarization 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:50.709
 From the Small and Medium Business Administration 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.879
 By continuing in the military 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:56.159
