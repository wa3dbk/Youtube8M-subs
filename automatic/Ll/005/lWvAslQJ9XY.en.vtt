00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
now I often have people asking me about

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.140 
now I often have people asking me about
what's<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.680> best<00:00:10.710> gaming<00:00:11.280> motherboard<00:00:11.460> or

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150

just<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.500> demonstrate<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:26.279> thought<00:00:26.580> I'd<00:00:26.730> take<00:00:26.939> a

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
just to demonstrate I thought I'd take a

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000 
just to demonstrate I thought I'd take a
couple<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.539> gaming<00:00:27.960> motherboards<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.800> pit

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
couple of gaming motherboards and pit

couple of gaming motherboards and pit
them<00:00:29.160> against<00:00:29.580> each<00:00:29.670> other<00:00:29.910> this<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.210> going<00:00:30.449> to

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
them against each other this is going to

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.500 
them against each other this is going to
be<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.630> bit<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.840> an<00:00:30.990> examination<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.120> 990<00:00:33.120> FX

yep I think that's the deal
we've<00:01:08.549> also<00:01:08.700> got<00:01:08.939> SATA<00:01:09.210> 2<00:01:09.510> okay<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.229> eight

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
we've also got SATA 2 okay so the eight

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.650 
we've also got SATA 2 okay so the eight

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:16.980 
sharper aesthetic all these SATA ports

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.280 
sharper aesthetic all these SATA ports
are<00:01:17.130> changed<00:01:17.430> over<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.850> SATA<00:01:18.150> 3<00:01:18.240> 6<00:01:18.690> gigabit<00:01:19.110> per

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
in these bulldozer 8 core CPUs when they

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.910 
in these bulldozer 8 core CPUs when they
are<00:01:35.310> released<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:35.850> basically<00:01:36.770> what<00:01:37.770> does<00:01:37.860> that

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
are released so basically what does that

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.340 
are released so basically what does that
mean<00:01:38.340> in<00:01:38.550> terms<00:01:38.580> of<00:01:38.970> its<00:01:39.090> performance<00:01:39.390> with<00:01:40.320> a

mean in terms of its performance with a
current<00:01:40.950> generation<00:01:41.490> processor<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.360> I

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
current generation processor so I

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.880 
current generation processor so I
thought<00:01:42.750> I'd<00:01:42.900> take<00:01:43.020> some<00:01:43.260> of<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.440> benchmarks

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
thought I'd take some of the benchmarks

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.790 
thought I'd take some of the benchmarks
I<00:01:44.010> did<00:01:44.159> before<00:01:44.490> this<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.450> what<00:01:45.690> the

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
I did before this is it this is what the

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.490 
I did before this is it this is what the
6990<00:01:46.800> dual<00:01:46.980> graphics<00:01:47.840> video<00:01:48.840> card<00:01:49.170> or<00:01:49.320> dual

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
my usual test bench and so I thought I'd

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.230 
my usual test bench and so I thought I'd

FX<00:02:00.690> to<00:02:00.840> see<00:02:00.990> how<00:02:01.080> it<00:02:01.170> goes<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:01.530> I'm<00:02:01.620> almost<00:02:01.770> done

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010

and<00:02:02.370> I'll<00:02:03.090> show<00:02:03.330> you<00:02:03.360> guys<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.600> results<00:02:03.900> when

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
and I'll show you guys the results when

and I'll show you guys the results when
I'm<00:02:04.470> done<00:02:04.650> and<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:04.950> think<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.580> if<00:02:05.909> you<00:02:06.450> have

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
I'm done and I think that if you have

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.719

these days you probably won't find these
results<00:02:13.200> very<00:02:13.590> surprising<00:02:14.840> alright<00:02:15.840> so

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
results very surprising alright so

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.830 
results very surprising alright so
here's<00:02:16.290> my<00:02:16.440> results<00:02:16.920> with<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.310> 890<00:02:18.060> FX<00:02:18.360> versus

here's my results with the 890 FX versus

the 990
next<00:02:19.980> chipset<00:02:20.400> so<00:02:20.610> I'm<00:02:21.060> gonna<00:02:21.210> leave<00:02:21.420> off

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
next chipset so I'm gonna leave off

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.510 
next chipset so I'm gonna leave off
Crysis<00:02:22.230> 2<00:02:22.260> for<00:02:22.650> now<00:02:22.740> we're<00:02:22.920> gonna<00:02:22.980> return<00:02:23.400> to

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
Crysis 2 for now we're gonna return to

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.340 
Crysis 2 for now we're gonna return to
that<00:02:23.640> but<00:02:23.880> let's<00:02:24.030> look<00:02:24.180> at<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.420> Witcher<00:02:24.750> so

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
that but let's look at the Witcher so

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.890 
that but let's look at the Witcher so
yeah<00:02:26.310> performs<00:02:26.790> about<00:02:27.000> eight<00:02:27.270> percent<00:02:27.450> better

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
yeah performs about eight percent better

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.860 
yeah performs about eight percent better
dirt<00:02:28.560> three<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.130> 99<00:02:29.490> dfx<00:02:30.120> is<00:02:30.330> a<00:02:30.360> little<00:02:30.600> slower

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
dirt three the 99 dfx is a little slower

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.760 
dirt three the 99 dfx is a little slower
fear<00:02:31.380> 3<00:02:31.650> they're<00:02:31.860> identical<00:02:33.710> Battlefield<00:02:34.710> Bad

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
fear 3 they're identical Battlefield Bad

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.280 
fear 3 they're identical Battlefield Bad
Company<00:02:34.920> 2<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.880> 990<00:02:36.270> FX<00:02:36.510> is<00:02:36.660> a<00:02:36.690> little<00:02:36.870> faster

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
Company 2 the 990 FX is a little faster

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.930 
Company 2 the 990 FX is a little faster
instead<00:02:37.590> of<00:02:37.680> 5<00:02:37.860> it's<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.100> little<00:02:38.310> faster<00:02:38.700> so<00:02:38.850> it

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
instead of 5 it's a little faster so it

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.790 
instead of 5 it's a little faster so it
seems<00:02:39.210> to<00:02:39.420> me<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.690> board<00:02:39.870> is<00:02:39.990> slightly<00:02:40.350> faster

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
seems to me the board is slightly faster

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.430 
seems to me the board is slightly faster
for<00:02:41.250> gaming<00:02:41.580> although<00:02:42.000> I<00:02:42.360> can't<00:02:42.990> really<00:02:43.050> say

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
for gaming although I can't really say

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.540 
for gaming although I can't really say
with<00:02:43.620> certainty<00:02:43.980> that<00:02:44.220> these<00:02:44.370> are

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
with certainty that these are

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.470 
with certainty that these are
significantly<00:02:45.590> different<00:02:46.590> enough<00:02:47.460> to<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.330> be

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
significantly different enough to to be

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.420 
significantly different enough to to be
representative<00:02:49.020> of<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.440> performance<00:02:50.040> Delta

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
representative of the performance Delta

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.250 
representative of the performance Delta
because<00:02:50.820> I<00:02:51.090> didn't<00:02:51.360> do<00:02:51.450> a<00:02:51.480> ton<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:51.780> runs<00:02:52.050> I've

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
because I didn't do a ton of runs I've

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.600 
because I didn't do a ton of runs I've
had<00:02:52.380> a<00:02:52.410> lot<00:02:52.620> of<00:02:52.710> benchmarking<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.370> do<00:02:53.460> this

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
had a lot of benchmarking to do this

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.850 
had a lot of benchmarking to do this
weekend<00:02:54.060> so<00:02:54.660> this<00:02:55.020> is<00:02:55.230> pretty<00:02:55.440> much<00:02:55.530> within

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
weekend so this is pretty much within

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.470 
weekend so this is pretty much within
the<00:02:56.100> margin<00:02:56.460> of<00:02:56.550> error<00:02:56.700> for<00:02:56.970> most<00:02:57.180> of<00:02:57.360> them

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
the margin of error for most of them

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.060 
the margin of error for most of them
although<00:02:57.570> which<00:02:57.810> are<00:02:58.020> -<00:02:58.170> I<00:02:58.200> have<00:02:58.530> very<00:02:58.560> good

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
although which are - I have very good

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.680 
although which are - I have very good
consistency<00:02:59.670> on<00:02:59.850> that<00:03:00.000> benchmark<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:00.570> would

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
consistency on that benchmark I would

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.210 
consistency on that benchmark I would
say<00:03:00.810> that<00:03:00.960> one's<00:03:01.110> definitely<00:03:01.530> out<00:03:01.770> ahead<00:03:01.980> and

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
say that one's definitely out ahead and

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.670 
say that one's definitely out ahead and
sieve<00:03:02.850> 5<00:03:03.120> is<00:03:03.330> just<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.630> late-game<00:03:03.840> view<00:03:04.410> so<00:03:04.650> that

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
sieve 5 is just a late-game view so that

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.350 
sieve 5 is just a late-game view so that
one<00:03:04.920> is<00:03:05.040> definitely<00:03:05.280> ahead<00:03:05.850> and<00:03:06.090> there<00:03:06.210> were

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
one is definitely ahead and there were

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.150 
one is definitely ahead and there were
they<00:03:06.900> were<00:03:06.930> distinctly<00:03:07.470> different<00:03:07.680> frame

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
they were distinctly different frame

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.390 
they were distinctly different frame
rates<00:03:08.400> as<00:03:08.580> 30<00:03:08.880> constant<00:03:09.840> 31<00:03:10.440> constants<00:03:11.250> so

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
rates as 30 constant 31 constants so

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.000 
rates as 30 constant 31 constants so
there's<00:03:11.640> a<00:03:11.780> not<00:03:12.780> much<00:03:13.020> room<00:03:13.530> for<00:03:13.590> error<00:03:13.800> there

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
there's a not much room for error there

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.760 
there's a not much room for error there

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
at this because Crysis 2 I ran it with

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.910 
at this because Crysis 2 I ran it with
the<00:03:38.190> when<00:03:38.610> I<00:03:38.640> was<00:03:38.730> originally<00:03:39.300> doing<00:03:39.680> this<00:03:40.680> one

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
the when I was originally doing this one

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.480 
the when I was originally doing this one
with<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.430> APU<00:03:41.910> versus<00:03:42.360> the<00:03:42.480> 1100<00:03:43.110> t<00:03:43.320> I<00:03:43.560> ran<00:03:44.310> it

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
with the APU versus the 1100 t I ran it

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.290 
with the APU versus the 1100 t I ran it
with<00:03:44.640> dual<00:03:44.850> 69<00:03:45.480> 70s<00:03:46.260> and<00:03:46.530> I<00:03:47.280> was<00:03:47.730> getting<00:03:47.940> zero

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
with dual 69 70s and I was getting zero

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.330 
with dual 69 70s and I was getting zero
scaling<00:03:48.840> on<00:03:49.020> this<00:03:49.290> platform<00:03:49.560> so<00:03:49.860> I<00:03:50.070> was<00:03:50.250> like

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
scaling on this platform so I was like

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.710 
scaling on this platform so I was like
okay<00:03:50.610> forget<00:03:50.940> it<00:03:51.000> so<00:03:51.180> that's<00:03:51.330> when<00:03:51.510> I<00:03:51.540> switched

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
okay forget it so that's when I switched

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.010 
okay forget it so that's when I switched
to<00:03:52.020> the<00:03:52.110> 6990<00:03:52.950> for<00:03:53.130> my<00:03:53.220> standardized

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
to the 6990 for my standardized

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.690 
to the 6990 for my standardized
benchmarking<00:03:55.020> platform<00:03:55.620> now<00:03:56.370> I<00:03:56.400> got

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
benchmarking platform now I got

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.300 
benchmarking platform now I got
reasonable<00:03:57.120> scaling<00:03:57.660> with<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.260> 690<00:03:58.980> so<00:03:59.130> I<00:03:59.190> was

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
reasonable scaling with the 690 so I was

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.740 
reasonable scaling with the 690 so I was
like<00:03:59.400> okay<00:03:59.850> well<00:04:00.030> I<00:04:00.180> mean<00:04:00.210> it<00:04:00.420> didn't<00:04:00.600> scale

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
like okay well I mean it didn't scale

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.970 
like okay well I mean it didn't scale
great<00:04:01.080> it<00:04:01.230> went<00:04:01.320> from<00:04:01.440> like<00:04:01.620> 40<00:04:01.950> to<00:04:02.040> 49<00:04:02.340> fps<00:04:03.300> and

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
great it went from like 40 to 49 fps and

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.110 
great it went from like 40 to 49 fps and
then<00:04:04.980> it<00:04:05.160> you<00:04:05.400> know<00:04:05.430> this<00:04:05.700> was<00:04:05.850> appropriate

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
then it you know this was appropriate

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.510 
then it you know this was appropriate
given<00:04:06.870> this<00:04:07.080> but<00:04:07.620> then<00:04:07.800> all<00:04:07.980> of<00:04:08.010> a<00:04:08.160> sudden<00:04:08.460> I

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
given this but then all of a sudden I

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.610 
given this but then all of a sudden I
mean<00:04:09.120> I<00:04:09.180> reran<00:04:09.510> this<00:04:09.720> again<00:04:10.020> and<00:04:10.260> I<00:04:10.320> got<00:04:10.470> the

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
mean I reran this again and I got the

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.160 
mean I reran this again and I got the
same<00:04:10.860> results<00:04:11.340> so<00:04:11.430> for<00:04:11.700> some<00:04:11.910> reason<00:04:12.170> this

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
same results so for some reason this

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.320 
same results so for some reason this
platform<00:04:13.500> performed<00:04:14.250> way<00:04:14.520> better<00:04:14.730> in<00:04:14.940> Crysis

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
platform performed way better in Crysis

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.460 
platform performed way better in Crysis
2<00:04:15.360> so<00:04:15.600> what<00:04:15.720> I'm<00:04:15.780> gonna<00:04:15.870> do<00:04:16.109> is<00:04:16.230> I'm<00:04:16.350> gonna

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
2 so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.099 
2 so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
throw<00:04:16.799> the<00:04:16.980> crosshair<00:04:17.430> 4<00:04:17.730> back<00:04:18.480> on<00:04:18.720> the<00:04:18.870> test

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
throw the crosshair 4 back on the test

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.500 
throw the crosshair 4 back on the test
bench<00:04:19.320> and<00:04:19.680> I'm<00:04:20.100> gonna<00:04:20.280> run<00:04:20.549> Crysis<00:04:21.060> 2<00:04:21.090> again

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
bench and I'm gonna run Crysis 2 again

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.720 
bench and I'm gonna run Crysis 2 again
see<00:04:21.930> what<00:04:22.140> happened<00:04:22.590> because<00:04:22.740> I'm<00:04:23.130> not<00:04:23.400> even

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
see what happened because I'm not even

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.250 
see what happened because I'm not even
reinstalling<00:04:24.270> I'm<00:04:24.510> not<00:04:24.630> even<00:04:24.810> changing<00:04:25.140> any

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
reinstalling I'm not even changing any

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.110 
reinstalling I'm not even changing any
drivers<00:04:25.650> and<00:04:25.770> changing<00:04:26.070> absolutely<00:04:26.700> nothing

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
drivers and changing absolutely nothing

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.240 
drivers and changing absolutely nothing
about<00:04:27.240> my<00:04:27.480> Windows<00:04:27.780> platform<00:04:28.320> in<00:04:28.860> order<00:04:29.010> to

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
about my Windows platform in order to

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.720 
about my Windows platform in order to
switch<00:04:29.430> between<00:04:29.669> 998

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
switch between 998

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.820 
switch between 998
the<00:04:30.880> effects<00:04:31.210> because<00:04:31.600> there<00:04:32.380> are<00:04:32.500> actually

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
the effects because there are actually

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.340 
the effects because there are actually
very<00:04:33.100> very<00:04:33.190> very<00:04:33.730> similar<00:04:34.270> chipsets<00:04:35.140> there's

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
very very very similar chipsets there's

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.660 
very very very similar chipsets there's
almost<00:04:35.500> no<00:04:35.740> difference<00:04:36.070> between<00:04:36.190> them<00:04:36.550> so

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:36.670 
almost no difference between them so

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.760 
almost no difference between them so
let's<00:04:36.850> see<00:04:36.940> what<00:04:37.090> happens<00:04:37.390> here<00:04:37.510> guys<00:04:37.770> well

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
let's see what happens here guys well

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.530 
let's see what happens here guys well
every<00:04:39.100> once<00:04:39.280> in<00:04:39.400> a<00:04:39.520> while<00:04:39.670> you<00:04:39.940> run<00:04:39.970> into<00:04:40.390> these

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
every once in a while you run into these

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.410 
every once in a while you run into these
bizarre<00:04:40.960> things<00:04:41.650> I<00:04:41.920> just<00:04:42.550> did<00:04:42.850> my<00:04:43.000> run-through

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
bizarre things I just did my run-through

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.020 
bizarre things I just did my run-through
again<00:04:43.720> and<00:04:43.900> if<00:04:44.830> nothing<00:04:45.040> else<00:04:45.400> there<00:04:45.820> it<00:04:45.910> is

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
again and if nothing else there it is

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.050 
again and if nothing else there it is
forty-nine<00:04:46.600> point<00:04:46.900> one<00:04:47.230> this<00:04:48.040> reassures<00:04:48.910> me

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
forty-nine point one this reassures me

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.590 
forty-nine point one this reassures me
that<00:04:49.210> my<00:04:49.570> crisis<00:04:50.050> to<00:04:50.230> run<00:04:50.440> through<00:04:50.770> is<00:04:50.950> fairly

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
that my crisis to run through is fairly

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.160 
that my crisis to run through is fairly
consistent<00:04:52.860> so<00:04:53.860> forty-nine<00:04:54.490> point<00:04:55.390> one<00:04:55.690> is<00:04:55.960> my

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
consistent so forty-nine point one is my

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.920 
consistent so forty-nine point one is my
new<00:04:56.470> result<00:04:56.890> so<00:04:57.430> yeah<00:04:57.940> you<00:04:58.000> see<00:04:58.540> this<00:04:58.690> kind<00:04:58.900> of

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
new result so yeah you see this kind of

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.270 
new result so yeah you see this kind of
thing<00:04:58.990> from<00:04:59.260> time<00:04:59.440> to<00:04:59.590> time<00:04:59.620> where<00:05:00.040> a

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
thing from time to time where a

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.330 
thing from time to time where a
particular<00:05:01.030> setup<00:05:01.570> is<00:05:01.900> a<00:05:02.320> little<00:05:02.650> bit<00:05:02.770> faster

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
particular setup is a little bit faster

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.240 
particular setup is a little bit faster
in<00:05:03.990> you<00:05:04.990> know<00:05:05.080> something<00:05:05.530> then<00:05:05.800> another<00:05:06.010> one

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
in you know something then another one

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.860 
in you know something then another one
even<00:05:06.520> though<00:05:06.610> they<00:05:06.730> should<00:05:06.790> be<00:05:07.030> very<00:05:07.240> similar

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
even though they should be very similar

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.010 
even though they should be very similar
so<00:05:08.260> the<00:05:08.440> 990<00:05:09.070> FX<00:05:09.460> crosshair<00:05:10.030> 5<00:05:10.240> formula<00:05:10.810> seems

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
so the 990 FX crosshair 5 formula seems

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.780 
so the 990 FX crosshair 5 formula seems
to<00:05:11.170> perform<00:05:11.500> better<00:05:11.680> in<00:05:11.950> Crysis<00:05:12.340> 2<00:05:12.370> with<00:05:12.670> the

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
to perform better in Crysis 2 with the

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.750 
to perform better in Crysis 2 with the
6990<00:05:13.630> than<00:05:13.780> the<00:05:13.900> crosshair<00:05:14.380> for<00:05:15.070> formula<00:05:15.550> i

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
6990 than the crosshair for formula i

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.610 
6990 than the crosshair for formula i
suspect<00:05:16.390> it's<00:05:16.570> just<00:05:16.840> a<00:05:16.960> quirk<00:05:17.230> of<00:05:17.470> my

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
suspect it's just a quirk of my

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.530 
suspect it's just a quirk of my
particular<00:05:18.070> setup<00:05:18.370> like<00:05:18.730> i<00:05:18.820> remember<00:05:19.210> i<00:05:19.240> had

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
particular setup like i remember i had

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.860 
particular setup like i remember i had
one<00:05:20.410> of<00:05:20.440> my<00:05:20.530> old<00:05:20.770> computers<00:05:21.340> it<00:05:22.090> was<00:05:22.360> like<00:05:22.840> a

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
one of my old computers it was like a

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.980 
one of my old computers it was like a

I never had to enter a CD key alright I
rather<00:05:33.910> not<00:05:34.060> never<00:05:34.630> had<00:05:34.780> then<00:05:34.900> I<00:05:35.110> never<00:05:35.500> had<00:05:35.680> to

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
rather not never had then I never had to

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.240 
rather not never had then I never had to
enter<00:05:36.070> the<00:05:36.190> CD<00:05:37.080> so<00:05:38.080> it<00:05:38.590> would<00:05:38.770> run<00:05:38.980> with<00:05:39.220> uh

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
with an OCD even back before that game

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.060 
with an OCD even back before that game
would<00:05:41.830> do<00:05:41.980> it<00:05:42.130> and<00:05:43.110> you<00:05:44.110> know<00:05:44.200> I<00:05:44.230> the<00:05:44.680> computer

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
would do it and you know I the computer

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.470 
would do it and you know I the computer
I<00:05:45.100> had<00:05:45.280> before<00:05:45.430> that<00:05:45.610> wouldn't<00:05:46.030> do<00:05:46.120> it<00:05:46.270> and<00:05:46.420> the

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.480 
I had before that wouldn't do it and the

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.970 
I had before that wouldn't do it and the
computer<00:05:46.840> I<00:05:46.870> upgraded<00:05:47.260> to<00:05:47.380> afterwards

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:47.980 
computer I upgraded to afterwards

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.280 
computer I upgraded to afterwards
wouldn't<00:05:48.370> do<00:05:48.490> it<00:05:48.670> and<00:05:48.910> it<00:05:49.450> was<00:05:49.570> just<00:05:49.600> sort<00:05:50.140> of<00:05:50.170> a

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:50.290 
wouldn't do it and it was just sort of a

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.170 
wouldn't do it and it was just sort of a
quirk<00:05:50.770> of<00:05:50.920> that<00:05:51.100> particular<00:05:51.610> platform<00:05:52.060> so

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
quirk of that particular platform so

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.960 
quirk of that particular platform so
there<00:05:52.300> you<00:05:52.390> go<00:05:52.510> so<00:05:52.720> those<00:05:53.380> are<00:05:53.590> my<00:05:53.740> results<00:05:54.010> for

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
there you go so those are my results for

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.690 
there you go so those are my results for
the<00:05:55.150> 890<00:05:55.720> FX<00:05:56.020> versus<00:05:56.380> the<00:05:56.530> 990<00:05:57.040> FX<00:05:57.340> I<00:05:57.490> would

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700 
the 890 FX versus the 990 FX I would

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.600 
the 890 FX versus the 990 FX I would
pretty<00:05:58.090> much<00:05:58.270> call<00:05:58.900> this<00:05:59.140> probably<00:05:59.860> some<00:06:00.310> kind

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
pretty much call this probably some kind

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.000 
pretty much call this probably some kind
of<00:06:00.700> a<00:06:00.820> weird<00:06:01.060> glitch<00:06:01.570> but<00:06:02.320> the<00:06:02.500> funny<00:06:02.710> thing<00:06:02.920> is

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.010 
of a weird glitch but the funny thing is

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.100 
of a weird glitch but the funny thing is
this<00:06:03.220> is<00:06:03.400> like<00:06:03.580> significantly<00:06:04.360> more<00:06:04.630> playable

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
this is like significantly more playable

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.170 
this is like significantly more playable
on<00:06:05.410> this<00:06:05.650> platform<00:06:05.890> then<00:06:06.370> like<00:06:06.790> this<00:06:06.970> is<00:06:07.150> a

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
on this platform then like this is a

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.050 
on this platform then like this is a
crappy<00:06:07.660> yet<00:06:07.900> 50<00:06:08.410> fps<00:06:08.830> and<00:06:08.860> this<00:06:09.160> is<00:06:09.310> a<00:06:09.340> good<00:06:09.610> 60

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
crappy yet 50 fps and this is a good 60

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.260 
crappy yet 50 fps and this is a good 60
you<00:06:10.180> can<00:06:10.240> really<00:06:10.600> feel<00:06:10.810> it<00:06:10.870> in<00:06:11.530> those<00:06:12.040> drops<00:06:12.460> so

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
you can really feel it in those drops so

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.750 
you can really feel it in those drops so

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 
of the cross hair five back on the bench

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.629 
of the cross hair five back on the bench
firing<00:06:44.120> up<00:06:44.240> Crysis<00:06:44.750> 2<00:06:44.780> again<00:06:45.530> well<00:06:46.130> guess<00:06:46.520> I'll

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 
firing up Crysis 2 again well guess I'll

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:48.100 
firing up Crysis 2 again well guess I'll
have<00:06:46.760> to<00:06:46.790> restart<00:06:47.240> before<00:06:47.389> I<00:06:47.600> do<00:06:47.660> that<00:06:47.780> and

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.110 
have to restart before I do that and

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.159 
have to restart before I do that and
then<00:06:48.820> yeah<00:06:49.820> I'm<00:06:49.970> changing<00:06:50.180> absolutely<00:06:50.870> zero

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:51.169 
then yeah I'm changing absolutely zero

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:55.790 
running at 16x in this slot all of that

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.000 
running at 16x in this slot all of that
stuff<00:06:56.090> so<00:06:56.930> let's<00:06:57.320> see<00:06:57.410> what<00:06:57.530> happens<00:06:57.830> let's

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.010 
stuff so let's see what happens let's

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:59.740 
stuff so let's see what happens let's
see<00:06:58.100> if<00:06:58.190> I<00:06:58.280> can<00:06:58.430> reproduce<00:06:58.700> these<00:06:59.000> results<00:06:59.570> I

00:06:59.740 --> 00:06:59.750 
see if I can reproduce these results I

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.879 
see if I can reproduce these results I
gave<00:07:01.480> well<00:07:02.480> I<00:07:02.510> figured<00:07:02.930> it<00:07:03.050> out<00:07:03.169> here's<00:07:03.710> my

00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:03.889 
gave well I figured it out here's my

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:07.680 
gave well I figured it out here's my
result<00:07:04.250> with<00:07:04.430> the<00:07:04.550> 990<00:07:05.060> FX<00:07:05.510> so<00:07:06.020> fifty<00:07:06.800> point

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:07.690 
result with the 990 FX so fifty point

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:12.810 
result with the 990 FX so fifty point
eight<00:07:10.660> so<00:07:11.660> I<00:07:11.690> can<00:07:11.960> throw<00:07:12.169> this<00:07:12.470> guy<00:07:12.770> out

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:12.820 
eight so I can throw this guy out

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:16.810 
eight so I can throw this guy out
because<00:07:13.820> here's<00:07:14.570> what<00:07:14.780> happened<00:07:15.260> the<00:07:15.770> 990<00:07:16.430> FX

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:16.820 
because here's what happened the 990 FX

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.080 
because here's what happened the 990 FX
