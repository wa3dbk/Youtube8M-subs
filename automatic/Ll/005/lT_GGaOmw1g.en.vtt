00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.870 
just fine so don't go judging me but
that<00:00:15.990> would<00:00:16.170> be<00:00:16.199> so<00:00:16.770> inconvenient<00:00:17.369> because

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
that would be so inconvenient because

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.310 
that would be so inconvenient because
you<00:00:18.119> have<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.300> take<00:00:18.449> out<00:00:18.539> your<00:00:18.720> wig<00:00:18.900> clips<00:00:19.080> and

you have to take out your wig clips and
everything<00:00:19.619> like<00:00:19.740> that<00:00:19.770> because<00:00:20.100> you<00:00:20.340> can't

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
everything like that because you can't

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.340 
everything like that because you can't
put<00:00:20.699> metal<00:00:20.820> in<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.060> microwave<00:00:21.150> or<00:00:22.080> else<00:00:22.230> of

put metal in the microwave or else of

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.019 
put metal in the microwave or else of
course<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.710> get<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:22.949> snap<00:00:23.220> crackle<00:00:23.580> pop<00:00:23.760> in

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.519 
new method from the lovely hair that'll
come<00:00:29.490> here<00:00:29.670> on<00:00:29.820> YouTube<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.170> great

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
come here on YouTube and it is a great

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.500 
come here on YouTube and it is a great
way<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.800> deep<00:00:32.189> condition<00:00:32.340> your<00:00:32.669> hair<00:00:33.000> without

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
way to deep condition your hair without

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.299 
way to deep condition your hair without
the<00:00:33.840> trouble<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.290> having<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.649> take<00:00:34.829> out<00:00:35.010> the

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
the trouble of having to take out the

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.970 
the trouble of having to take out the
wig<00:00:35.460> clips<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.690> find<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.410> method<00:00:37.860> is

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
wig clips and I find that this method is

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.459 
wig clips and I find that this method is
probably<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.640> little<00:00:39.030> bit<00:00:39.210> deeper<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.290> deep

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
probably a little bit deeper of a deep

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.080 
probably a little bit deeper of a deep
condition<00:00:40.950> than<00:00:41.280> putting<00:00:41.550> my<00:00:41.700> hair<00:00:41.879> in<00:00:42.000> the
