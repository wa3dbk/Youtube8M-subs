look<00:00:26.359> looks<00:00:27.359> good<00:00:30.980> okay<00:00:31.980> in<00:00:32.279> order<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.820> do

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
look looks good okay in order to do

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.569 
look looks good okay in order to do
these<00:00:33.180> calculations<00:00:34.010> we<00:00:35.010> need<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.280> know<00:00:35.370> more

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
these calculations we need to know more

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.479 
these calculations we need to know more
about<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.940> Doppler<00:00:36.300> effect<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:37.489> generally

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
about the Doppler effect and generally

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.920 
about the Doppler effect and generally
that<00:00:38.610> just<00:00:38.850> means<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.180> objects<00:00:39.660> moving

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
that just means that objects moving

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.540 
that just means that objects moving
towards<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.559> sound<00:00:40.920> like<00:00:41.100> they<00:00:41.370> have<00:00:41.520> a

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
towards you sound like they have a

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.119 
towards you sound like they have a
higher<00:00:41.820> frequency<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.710> objects<00:00:43.710> moving<00:00:43.920> away

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
higher frequency and objects moving away

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.470 
higher frequency and objects moving away
from<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.520> sound<00:00:44.789> like<00:00:44.850> they<00:00:45.090> have<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.239> lower

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
from you sound like they have a lower

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.889 
from you sound like they have a lower
frequency<00:00:47.030> for<00:00:48.030> more<00:00:48.149> information<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.690> can

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
frequency for more information you can

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.819 
frequency for more information you can
check<00:00:48.960> Wikipedia<00:00:50.930> and<00:00:51.930> will<00:00:52.140> also<00:00:52.320> need<00:00:52.620> for

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
check Wikipedia and will also need for

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.740 
check Wikipedia and will also need for
these<00:00:52.949> calculations<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:54.420> know<00:00:54.510> what<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
these calculations to know what the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.010 
these calculations to know what the
speed<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.170> sound<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:56.360> when<00:00:57.360> we<00:00:57.539> make<00:00:57.750> these

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
speed of sound is when we make these

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.180 
speed of sound is when we make these
recordings<00:00:59.870> the<00:01:00.870> speed<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.230> sound<00:01:01.410> depends

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
recordings the speed of sound depends

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.820 
recordings the speed of sound depends
primarily<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.940> temperature<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.809> we<00:01:04.710> can

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
primarily on the temperature and we can

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.109 
primarily on the temperature and we can
use<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> formula<00:01:05.400> here<00:01:06.680> this<00:01:07.680> one<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.850> calculate

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
use a formula here this one to calculate

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.910 
use a formula here this one to calculate
what<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.960> speed<00:01:10.290> would<00:01:10.500> be<00:01:11.390> it's<00:01:12.390> based<00:01:12.689> on<00:01:12.930> a

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
what that speed would be it's based on a

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.670 
what that speed would be it's based on a
novel<00:01:14.610> speed<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:16.009> 331<00:01:17.009> meters<00:01:17.310> per<00:01:17.520> second<00:01:18.680> in

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
novel speed of 331 meters per second in

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.080 
novel speed of 331 meters per second in
a<00:01:19.770> calculation<00:01:20.280> which<00:01:20.549> involves<00:01:20.970> the

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
a calculation which involves the

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
a calculation which involves the
temperature<00:01:21.570> V<00:01:22.939> and<00:01:23.939> we<00:01:24.150> compute<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:24.990> square

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
temperature V and we compute the square

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.690 
temperature V and we compute the square
root<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.560> 1<00:01:25.830> plus<00:01:26.040> V<00:01:26.520> over<00:01:27.470> 273<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.700> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
root of 1 plus V over 273 and the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.450 
root of 1 plus V over 273 and the
temperature<00:01:30.150> is<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.479> Celsius<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:32.070> if<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.310> need

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
temperature is in Celsius so if you need

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.030 
temperature is in Celsius so if you need
to<00:01:32.549> convert<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:34.020> can<00:01:34.170> use<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.380> unit

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
to convert that you can use a unit

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.990 
to convert that you can use a unit
converter<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.780> I've<00:01:36.780> done<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.200> already<00:01:37.439> I

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
converter and I've done that already I

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.300 
converter and I've done that already I
have<00:01:39.000> assumed<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:39.479> video<00:01:39.840> was<00:01:40.170> recorded<00:01:40.979> at

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
have assumed this video was recorded at

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.810 
have assumed this video was recorded at
77<00:01:42.299> degrees<00:01:42.329> Fahrenheit<00:01:43.049> which<00:01:43.890> would<00:01:44.159> be<00:01:44.310> 25

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
77 degrees Fahrenheit which would be 25

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.620 
77 degrees Fahrenheit which would be 25
degrees<00:01:45.240> Celsius<00:01:47.090> I've<00:01:48.090> done<00:01:48.479> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
degrees Celsius I've done the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.289 
degrees Celsius I've done the
calculation<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.710> works<00:01:49.920> out<00:01:50.100> 2<00:01:50.340> 340<00:01:51.270> 6

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
calculation and that works out 2 340 6

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.550 
calculation and that works out 2 340 6
meters<00:01:52.110> per<00:01:52.350> second<00:01:53.869> which<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:54.899> equivalent<00:01:55.290> to

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
meters per second which is equivalent to

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.020 
meters per second which is equivalent to
roughly

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:05.140 

774<00:01:59.030> miles<00:01:59.840> per<00:02:00.110> hour<00:02:03.820> let's<00:02:04.820> look<00:02:04.970> at

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
774 miles per hour let's look at

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.930 
774 miles per hour let's look at
audacity<00:02:05.780> now<00:02:05.930> and<00:02:06.380> this<00:02:06.950> is<00:02:07.010> the<00:02:07.280> audio<00:02:07.580> track

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
audacity now and this is the audio track

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.370 
audacity now and this is the audio track
from<00:02:08.840> that<00:02:09.110> video<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:11.660> section<00:02:12.080> which<00:02:12.200> have

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
from that video the section which have

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.520 
from that video the section which have
highlighted<00:02:13.100> in<00:02:13.310> gray<00:02:13.730> is<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.930> past<00:02:15.170> that<00:02:15.410> we

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
highlighted in gray is the past that we

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.400 
highlighted in gray is the past that we
just<00:02:15.740> looked<00:02:15.950> at<00:02:16.360> so<00:02:17.360> let's<00:02:17.570> zoom<00:02:17.990> in<00:02:18.140> on<00:02:18.320> that

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
just looked at so let's zoom in on that

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.320 
just looked at so let's zoom in on that
let<00:02:21.410> me<00:02:21.500> see<00:02:21.680> here<00:02:21.920> that<00:02:22.100> the<00:02:22.820> helicopter

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
let me see here that the helicopter

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.960 
let me see here that the helicopter
becomes<00:02:23.630> louder<00:02:23.960> as<00:02:24.440> it<00:02:25.190> approaches<00:02:25.520> the

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
becomes louder as it approaches the

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.860 
becomes louder as it approaches the
camera<00:02:26.720> and<00:02:27.430> becomes<00:02:28.430> quieter<00:02:29.090> as<00:02:29.330> it<00:02:29.720> gets

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
camera and becomes quieter as it gets

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.160 
camera and becomes quieter as it gets
further<00:02:30.050> away<00:02:31.060> likewise<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.090> frequency<00:02:32.870> will

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
further away likewise the frequency will

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.630 
further away likewise the frequency will
be<00:02:33.709> increased<00:02:34.190> as<00:02:34.370> it<00:02:34.490> approaches<00:02:34.790> and<00:02:36.640> begin

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
be increased as it approaches and begin

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.510 
be increased as it approaches and begin
to<00:02:37.760> decrease<00:02:38.090> as<00:02:38.420> it<00:02:38.930> departs<00:02:42.190> let's<00:02:43.190> look<00:02:43.340> at

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
to decrease as it departs let's look at

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.640 
to decrease as it departs let's look at
the<00:02:43.670> spectrogram<00:02:44.270> for<00:02:44.540> this<00:02:45.670> as<00:02:47.170> we<00:02:48.170> discussed

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
the spectrogram for this as we discussed

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.570 
the spectrogram for this as we discussed
previously<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:50.420> main<00:02:50.600> blade<00:02:50.840> rate<00:02:51.080> is

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
previously the main blade rate is

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.250 
previously the main blade rate is
running<00:02:52.580> around<00:02:52.820> approximately<00:02:53.690> 100<00:02:54.050> Hertz

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
running around approximately 100 Hertz

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.140 
running around approximately 100 Hertz
which<00:02:54.640> would<00:02:55.640> be<00:02:55.760> 3000<00:02:56.330> rpm<00:02:57.700> but<00:02:58.700> we<00:02:58.820> can<00:02:58.970> get

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
which would be 3000 rpm but we can get

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.720 
which would be 3000 rpm but we can get
more<00:02:59.300> accurate<00:02:59.780> measurements<00:03:00.290> if<00:03:00.440> we<00:03:01.400> look<00:03:01.550> at

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
more accurate measurements if we look at

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.440 
more accurate measurements if we look at
harmonics<00:03:02.420> of<00:03:02.660> that<00:03:03.080> signal<00:03:03.970> and<00:03:04.970> there's<00:03:05.390> a

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
harmonics of that signal and there's a

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.150 
harmonics of that signal and there's a
nice<00:03:05.660> one<00:03:05.959> here<00:03:06.200> at<00:03:06.410> around<00:03:06.620> eight<00:03:06.890> hundred

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
nice one here at around eight hundred

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.890 
nice one here at around eight hundred
and<00:03:07.280> fifty<00:03:07.610> Hertz<00:03:07.850> which<00:03:08.030> drops<00:03:08.540> down<00:03:08.810> to<00:03:09.459> say

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
and fifty Hertz which drops down to say

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.080 
and fifty Hertz which drops down to say
775<00:03:12.580> which<00:03:13.580> we<00:03:13.760> can<00:03:13.910> use<00:03:14.150> in<00:03:14.420> this<00:03:14.810> calculation

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
775 which we can use in this calculation

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.460 
775 which we can use in this calculation
because<00:03:17.090> it's<00:03:17.269> based<00:03:17.780> on<00:03:18.050> the<00:03:18.110> relative

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
because it's based on the relative

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.940 
because it's based on the relative
frequencies<00:03:19.400> of<00:03:20.050> approaching<00:03:21.050> and<00:03:21.230> departing

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
frequencies of approaching and departing

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.199 
frequencies of approaching and departing
signals<00:03:24.519> so<00:03:25.519> I'm<00:03:25.610> going<00:03:25.640> to<00:03:25.790> select<00:03:25.910> this

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
signals so I'm going to select this

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.280 
signals so I'm going to select this
initial<00:03:26.750> section<00:03:27.519> at<00:03:28.519> around<00:03:29.110> fifty<00:03:30.110> three

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
initial section at around fifty three

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.110 
initial section at around fifty three
and<00:03:30.380> a<00:03:30.440> half<00:03:30.470> seconds<00:03:31.070> into<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:31.519> video<00:03:31.930> and

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
and a half seconds into the video and

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.180 
and a half seconds into the video and
plot<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.300> spectrum<00:03:38.110> here<00:03:39.110> we<00:03:39.320> see<00:03:39.530> there<00:03:39.769> is<00:03:39.950> a

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
plot the spectrum here we see there is a

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.460 
plot the spectrum here we see there is a
measurement<00:03:41.000> of<00:03:41.920> 850<00:03:42.920> 6<00:03:43.130> hertz<00:03:43.489> on<00:03:44.170> that<00:03:45.170> line

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
measurement of 850 6 hertz on that line

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:52.580 
measurement of 850 6 hertz on that line
as<00:03:45.739> the<00:03:45.799> helicopter<00:03:46.790> approaches<00:03:47.269> the<00:03:47.420> camera

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:59.610 

and<00:03:54.390> as<00:03:55.390> it<00:03:55.570> moves<00:03:55.780> away<00:03:57.990> we<00:03:58.990> can<00:03:59.170> find<00:03:59.470> the

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
and as it moves away we can find the

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:07.080 
and as it moves away we can find the
frequency<00:03:59.830> has<00:04:01.290> dropped<00:04:02.290> to<00:04:04.260> 700<00:04:05.260> and<00:04:05.640> say<00:04:06.640> 40

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
frequency has dropped to 700 and say 40

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:17.990 
frequency has dropped to 700 and say 40
Hertz<00:04:12.060> now<00:04:13.060> the<00:04:13.140> calculation<00:04:16.109> for<00:04:17.109> the<00:04:17.260> speed

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
Hertz now the calculation for the speed

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.840 
Hertz now the calculation for the speed
is<00:04:19.000> based<00:04:19.329> on<00:04:19.650> the<00:04:20.650> frequency<00:04:20.920> approaching

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.230 
is based on the frequency approaching
minus<00:04:22.840> the<00:04:22.990> frequency<00:04:23.530> departing<00:04:24.240> all

minus the frequency departing all

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.409 
minus the frequency departing all
divided<00:04:25.900> by<00:04:26.220> the<00:04:27.220> frequency<00:04:27.790> approaching

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
divided by the frequency approaching

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.580 
divided by the frequency approaching
plus<00:04:29.080> the<00:04:29.740> frequency<00:04:30.250> departing<00:04:30.760> and<00:04:31.590> we

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
plus the frequency departing and we

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.500 
plus the frequency departing and we
multiply<00:04:33.040> that<00:04:33.280> by<00:04:33.460> the<00:04:33.610> speed<00:04:33.940> of<00:04:34.060> sound<00:04:34.090> that

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
multiply that by the speed of sound that

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.830 
multiply that by the speed of sound that
we're<00:04:34.780> interested<00:04:35.080> in<00:04:36.540> let's<00:04:37.540> do<00:04:37.720> the

miles<00:05:09.550> per<00:05:09.910> hour<00:05:11.130> tells<00:05:12.130> us<00:05:12.340> that<00:05:12.550> the

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
miles per hour tells us that the

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:17.310 
miles per hour tells us that the
helicopter<00:05:12.850> was<00:05:13.390> traveling<00:05:14.490> at<00:05:15.600> 56<00:05:16.600> miles<00:05:17.050> per
