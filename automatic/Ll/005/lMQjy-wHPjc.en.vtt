00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:39.630 
I am on this is the server time on and

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.150 
I am on this is the server time on and
this<00:00:40.079> this<00:00:41.070> usually<00:00:41.430> works<00:00:41.640> on<00:00:41.940> number<00:00:42.390> IP

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
this this usually works on number IP

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.910 
this this usually works on number IP
these<00:00:44.160> numbers<00:00:44.910> in<00:00:45.060> them<00:00:45.440> because<00:00:46.440> if<00:00:46.740> they

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
these numbers in them because if they

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.190

so<00:01:48.300> this<00:01:48.510> services<00:01:49.200> start<00:01:49.650> lagging<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.400> lot<00:01:51.950> as

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
so this services start lagging a lot as

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.410 
so this services start lagging a lot as
you<00:01:53.010> see<00:01:53.250> I'm<00:01:53.370> not<00:01:53.610> I'm<00:01:53.850> normally<00:01:54.390> not

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
you see I'm not I'm normally not

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.260 
you see I'm not I'm normally not
supposed<00:01:55.080> to<00:01:55.260> break<00:01:55.650> these<00:01:55.979> things<00:01:56.120> but<00:01:57.120> now<00:01:57.240> I

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
supposed to break these things but now I

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.969 
supposed to break these things but now I
can<00:01:58.850> lag<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.270> then<00:02:00.900> it<00:02:00.990> takes<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.470> little<00:02:01.680> while

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
can lag and then it takes a little while

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.060 
can lag and then it takes a little while
for<00:02:02.190> to<00:02:02.430> respond<00:02:03.110> this<00:02:04.110> doesn't<00:02:04.619> really<00:02:04.740> crash

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
for to respond this doesn't really crash

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.530 
for to respond this doesn't really crash
it<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.490> mean<00:02:05.790> if<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.940> have<00:02:06.030> like<00:02:06.150> 20<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.479> these

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
it I mean if you have like 20 of these

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.810 
it I mean if you have like 20 of these
open<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.170> will<00:02:07.350> crash<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.830> only<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.550> small

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
open and will crash it only a small

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.430 
open and will crash it only a small
service<00:02:09.209> though<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.600> don't<00:02:09.840> pissed<00:02:10.080> off<00:02:10.259> any

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
service though and don't pissed off any

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.600 
service though and don't pissed off any
of<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.619> big<00:02:10.770> servers<00:02:11.100> because<00:02:11.250> they're<00:02:11.490> going

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
of the big servers because they're going

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.990 
of the big servers because they're going
to<00:02:11.700> come<00:02:11.850> after<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.650> anyway

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
to come after you anyway

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.820 
to come after you anyway
yeah<00:02:15.000> so<00:02:15.240> it<00:02:15.510> should<00:02:15.660> get<00:02:15.750> worse<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.110> worse<00:02:18.830> as

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
yeah so it should get worse and worse as

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:26.390 
yeah so it should get worse and worse as
you<00:02:20.010> can<00:02:20.130> see<00:02:22.580> Lego<00:02:23.989> the<00:02:24.989> four<00:02:25.290> doors<00:02:25.680> like<00:02:25.890> no

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
you can see Lego the four doors like no

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.320 
you can see Lego the four doors like no
lag<00:02:26.670> now<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:28.020> lag<00:02:28.230> is<00:02:28.380> real<00:02:29.150> and<00:02:31.280> yeah<00:02:32.280> so<00:02:32.610> if

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
lag now the lag is real and yeah so if

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.940 
lag now the lag is real and yeah so if
you<00:02:33.390> keep<00:02:33.690> this<00:02:33.900> on<00:02:34.140> long<00:02:34.380> enough<00:02:34.410> it<00:02:34.770> will

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
you keep this on long enough it will

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.890 
you keep this on long enough it will
crash<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.340> server<00:02:35.489> or<00:02:36.180> if<00:02:36.360> you<00:02:36.420> have<00:02:36.540> multiple

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
crash the server or if you have multiple

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.530 
crash the server or if you have multiple
people<00:02:37.200> maybe<00:02:37.380> trolls<00:02:38.269> maybe<00:02:39.269> throw<00:02:39.510> some

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
people maybe trolls maybe throw some

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
fast so yeah that was just a little

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.190 
fast so yeah that was just a little
thing<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:50.850> I'll<00:02:51.450> go<00:02:51.630> over<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.959> command

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
thing and I'll go over the command

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.890 
thing and I'll go over the command
prompt<00:02:52.380> thing<00:02:52.590> once<00:02:52.769> again<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.190> is<00:02:53.480> ping<00:02:54.480> the

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
prompt thing once again it is ping the

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.850 
prompt thing once again it is ping the
IP<00:02:55.110> I<00:02:55.709> probably<00:02:56.400> saw<00:02:56.610> this<00:02:56.760> um<00:02:57.260> so<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.410> is<00:02:58.560> close

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
IP I probably saw this um so it is close

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.009 
IP I probably saw this um so it is close
so<00:02:59.190> it<00:02:59.700> is<00:03:00.080> ping<00:03:01.760> space<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:03.060> IP<00:03:03.269> that<00:03:03.510> you<00:03:03.720> want

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
so it is ping space the IP that you want

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.360 
so it is ping space the IP that you want
to<00:03:04.290> UM<00:03:05.390> diet<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.690> IP<00:03:07.019> of<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.230> micro<00:03:07.530> server<00:03:07.739> -

pinging normally just for - L is the

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
number of bytes you send and then 6556

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.000 
number of bytes you send and then 6556
d5500<00:03:20.420> which<00:03:21.420> is<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:22.019> number<00:03:22.470> of<00:03:22.590> bytes<00:03:22.799> that

d5500 which is the number of bytes that
you<00:03:23.870> you<00:03:24.870> will<00:03:25.079> specify<00:03:25.290> from<00:03:25.709> -<00:03:26.130> L<00:03:26.930> so<00:03:28.070> it<00:03:29.070> is

you you will specify from - L so it is

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
still lagging lag not as much now that I

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.620 
still lagging lag not as much now that I
stopped<00:03:34.200> one<00:03:34.459> but<00:03:35.459> I<00:03:35.670> can<00:03:35.880> always<00:03:36.150> start<00:03:36.360> again

and<00:03:43.790> more<00:03:45.560> and<00:03:46.560> more<00:03:48.680> it<00:03:49.680> will<00:03:49.890> get<00:03:50.070> really

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
and more and more it will get really

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.750 
and more and more it will get really
really<00:03:50.760> bad

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
really bad

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.759
