 You copy and paste here in the 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.199
 program run right done it you 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.510
 give an ok then you will expect a 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.140
 little and there will appear this program 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.149
 what disk management ok then here 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.340
 is the following the staff will have that your 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.470

 that your Hindus are generally also 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.110
 appears here in a black color that 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.240
 this unallocated option appears this is 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.950
 normal does not have any problem then it 's the 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.020
 next to a partition're wanting the 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.360
 What are you going to do, will you come here? 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.270
 local disk that you will tighten with 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.159
 right and will turn the 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.740
 volume will be consulting here a 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.080
 space , so here is how much 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.030
 the more tips you have the longer it will take 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.130
 to consult that this space of 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.320
 then it has a bit of 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.479
 ok then ok then personal 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.860
 consult iwa this option will appear 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.240
 here for you 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.000
 so people here are going to be able to 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.340
 Decrease your HD so you can create 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.310
 then a partition and you just go 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.220
 here we can reduce this space 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:54.060
 you have here in the case here 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.729
 the mb is speaking that wants mb megabytes right? 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.259
 but in the case it means gigabyte then 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.390
 let's say you want to create a 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.649
 partition of 10 gigabytes so what 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.430
 Are you going to do it if you can be? 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.290
 putting at 10,000 I put ten thousand 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.140
 210 So we 're creating a 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.819
 10-gigabyte partition 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.350
 then after you put the 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.690
 How much do you want? 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.130
 for your new partition you click 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.020
 decrease 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.880
 So people like you can see that 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.380
 created our part are so now is the 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.930
 next folks here it is written no 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.090
 this means that it is not in 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.500
 run now what you need 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.480
 do the following press here with the 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.420
 right click that in new volume 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.800
 simple to click forward and want 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.650
 move forward again 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.590
 here you can assign a letter to 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.960
 this partition you created then I will 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.030
 put here the letter p 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.630
 and I'll click forward here you go 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.670
 leave 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.460
 this way even the only thing you 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.710
 will do well here in the label option of 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.360
 volume and put the name you want 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.760
 for this partition I'm going to put here 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.650
 programs that I'm going to save some 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.800
 programs in this part are so I will 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.600
 now to advance and then complete 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.790
 As you can see, people created here. 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.320
 our part are the part are programs 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.910
 so right now we will do 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.640
 next you will see what it 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.500
 computer and here is the condition that the 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.680
 people created it's personal so that 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.840
 serves these parts for what it serves 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.940
 create a partition there is as follows 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.680
 these parts are generally the 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.720
 people use to save files 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.880
 important, because at the time of 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.460
 formatting will appear an option to 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.970
 you do the following format the disk 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:35.040
 local drive or format this local drive p 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.320
 that we created this new partition 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.550
 so in case you will format the disk 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.800
 local c 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.080
 and then this new partition that people 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.210
 created then will remain intact is personal 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.980
 it will not be removed then 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.500
 way you can save your 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.000
 files and when you 're going to kill yourself 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.770
 you will be able to use your 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.070
 files because they will not be 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:58.140
 excluded at the time of formatting is correct 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:01.290
 But for this, remembering that you have to 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.690
 format only the local disk cent not 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.000
 format the partition you created 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.220
 so this is it, guys, you go there 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.940
 save your image files 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.180
 their music drives your downloads 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.620
 important and plays pro all here 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.210
 partition that we created a game in the 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.520
 time for you to kill her 

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:23.310
 the local disk you're going to have to 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:26.370
 all your programs your drives 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.800
 anyway whatever you think to think 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.090
 the partition is sure personal and then it is 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.389
 that's it folks generally people 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.280
 creates these parts to save the 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.960
 important files is ok 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.790
 if you want to delete the 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.949
 partition you created the first thing 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:44.160
 what to do is if you have saved 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:46.139
 files here you then back up 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.760
 of your files and then you can 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.580
 be back here in the option of 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.500
 Disk Management to come here in 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:56.250
 the partition you created by pushing a 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:59.479
 right to come here to exclude the volume 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.710
 And you come here in Sintra. 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:04.229
 deleted then the partition that you 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.180
 created and will appear here personal not 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:07.710
 allocated is what you are going to do 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.810
 so you will see here on the local disk 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.030
 if you press the right button to see 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.800
 we extend volume so now let's 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.770
 click forward with those who want 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.360
 move forward again and complete 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.160
 so now you will stay here in person 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.199
 as you can see in that blue color 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.720
 means that not all capacity 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:27.150
 in all the gigabyte being 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.160
 used by the local dry disk 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.830
 when we come back here to start 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.979
 The computer then fixes 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:37.320
 excluded the partition programs is that the 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:39.750
 people created the partition and it stays here 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.570
 then it returns to normal in this only 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.669
 being here then the disk put some and 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.710
 so this is it, guys, I hope you 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:47.639
 understood and liked the video 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.500
 and I liked it 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:53.990
 we share it then this is it
