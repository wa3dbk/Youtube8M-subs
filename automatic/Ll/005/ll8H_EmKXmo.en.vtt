00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.490
 so my dear 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.530
 Today we put together 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.860
 We all wanted to know with him also Zeitz Bartenbach 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:15.110
 the Mainkofener Faisst made and so on who with if you one 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:18.109
 to get beautiful cake stand 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.550
 which has four floors 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.119
 we now have the fourth floor 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.060
 so march down first let the plans here now on it 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.340
 everyone will be working and waiting to ask questions today 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.130
 a first explanation 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.070
 Location to be downed here are now two goals assassinations we have 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.990
 first no recipe the cake 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.040
 became us 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.150
 Sponsored 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.500
 that's our mirror pancake 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.500
 who baked yesterday 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.980
 We have already let it slide on 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.970
 and how it goes with the slide on it let's show you this 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.730
 is not that easy 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.260
 because a cake can crack quite well 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.840
 So I asked for help 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.190
 it should always be someone 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.780
 hold the turntable 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.479
 and then you go with a prepare anyway, say it very carefully 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.290
 one of the wells Mr. Bohmann 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.290
 that deeds are functionally everything 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.980
 so try my very slow 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.050
 this cake 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.050
 high-level Hella glide 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.790
 so there you should 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.790
 Do not give possible do not do it alone 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.100
 He is very difficult 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.930
 so of course you could of course quite the fourth pies plate if this 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.329
 Pies you have arranged are not quite as high as there are also little BÃ¶nen 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:16.540
 then you could still do this one can of course so too 

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:20.169
 but we are now dropping in the case 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:23.519
 up there you could make another group on it 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.849
 for example on 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.849
 the little things still from the wedding cake child 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:32.700
 You can possibly even go over it but we will do it now 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:35.699
 as a precaution, not once 

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:39.089
 but you see 

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:43.649
 looks super nice needs very little space if you otherwise three or 

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:46.649
 four high on a table 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:51.859
 wanted to analyze then at least I would say 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:54.999
 Ainedter 20 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:58.159
 that's all in the smallest space 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:01.159
 and looks very good 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:08.539
 as far as he now has a hole up here but actually the 

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:13.069
 14 said Stennert's purchase should be the fourth bankruptcy 

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:16.869
 Let's take a little round here 

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:21.879
 and put that up there 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:24.549
 then it looks pretty 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.549
 and nobody realizes that there actually 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.759
 A fourth bankrupt should look like intended 

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:37.859
 I'm going to imitate diversity 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.859
 He finds 60 beautiful things at Venlo 

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:44.229
 he already said that 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:47.299
 Of course we can organize it differently but that's natural 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.049
 very nice 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.049
 have fun 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.659
