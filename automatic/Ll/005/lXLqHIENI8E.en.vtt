you can see i cut a little corner out

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.410 
you can see i cut a little corner out
here<00:01:34.249> now<00:01:35.249> the<00:01:35.490> tube<00:01:35.729> i<00:01:36.060> cut<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.899> groove<00:01:37.049> in<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:38.420> a

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
here now the tube i cut a groove in it a

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.410 
here now the tube i cut a groove in it a
slot<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.469> mean<00:01:40.859> an<00:01:40.950> angle<00:01:41.249> and<00:01:41.459> groove<00:01:41.639> an<00:01:41.850> angle

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
slot I mean an angle and groove an angle

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.940 
slot I mean an angle and groove an angle
so<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.810> water<00:01:42.929> won't<00:01:43.409> get<00:01:43.619> plugged<00:01:43.829> up

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
so that the water won't get plugged up

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.760 
so that the water won't get plugged up
the<00:01:44.399> ideas<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.779> want<00:01:46.109> to<00:01:46.170> put<00:01:46.289> water<00:01:46.409> in<00:01:46.619> here

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
the ideas that want to put water in here

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.429 
the ideas that want to put water in here
this<00:01:47.459> fills<00:01:47.729> up<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.149> then<00:01:48.659> well<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.259> dirt

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
this fills up and then well the dirt

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.809 
this fills up and then well the dirt
will<00:01:49.590> be<00:01:49.679> full<00:01:49.889> in<00:01:50.009> here<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:50.459> then<00:01:50.609> it<00:01:50.700> will

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
will be full in here so then it will

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.899 
will be full in here so then it will
wick<00:01:51.029> up<00:01:51.420> into<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.990> soil<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.560> am<00:01:53.340> going<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.579> put

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
wick up into the soil I am going to put

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.010 
wick up into the soil I am going to put
holes<00:01:54.270> here<00:01:55.170> lower<00:01:55.670> than<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:57.029> top<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.899> the

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
holes here lower than the top of the

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.929 
holes here lower than the top of the
bottom<00:01:58.380> here<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.069> it<00:01:59.219> also<00:01:59.639> be<00:01:59.819> the

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
bottom here so that it also be the

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.849 
bottom here so that it also be the
overfill<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:01.079> way<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.229> know<00:02:01.349> that<00:02:01.709> it's

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:01.859 
overfill that way I know that it's

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:02.880 
overfill that way I know that it's
filled<00:02:02.099> up

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
filled up

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.950 
filled up
you
