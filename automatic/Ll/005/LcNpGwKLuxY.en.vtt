controller<00:00:36.750> if<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.590> can<00:00:37.770> see<00:00:38.010> here<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.700> looks

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
controller if you can see here it looks

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.690 
controller if you can see here it looks
just<00:00:39.540> like<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.780> ps3<00:00:40.140> controller<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:41.100> has<00:00:41.130> all

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
just like a ps3 controller it has all

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.290 
just like a ps3 controller it has all
the<00:00:41.880> buttons<00:00:42.380> everything<00:00:43.380> feels<00:00:43.860> like

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
the buttons everything feels like

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.860 
the buttons everything feels like
absolutely<00:00:46.160> absolutely<00:00:47.160> nice<00:00:47.880> and<00:00:48.450> obviously

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
absolutely absolutely nice and obviously

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.360 
absolutely absolutely nice and obviously
here<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.260> can<00:00:49.410> tell<00:00:49.560> it's<00:00:49.680> by<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> third<00:00:50.100> party

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
here you can tell it's by a third party

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.510 
here you can tell it's by a third party
because<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.600> oh<00:00:52.380> whoops<00:00:52.800> I'd<00:00:53.010> probably<00:00:53.280> just

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
because the oh whoops I'd probably just

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.240 
because the oh whoops I'd probably just
turned<00:00:53.730> on<00:00:53.880> my<00:00:53.970> ps3<00:00:54.240> but<00:00:55.080> actually<00:00:56.070> no<00:00:56.220> I

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
turned on my ps3 but actually no I

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:03.410 
turned on my ps3 but actually no I
didn't<00:00:56.670> oh<00:00:57.110> maybe<00:00:58.110> not<00:00:59.180> but<00:01:01.430> overall<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.940> bought

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
didn't oh maybe not but overall I bought

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.490 
didn't oh maybe not but overall I bought
this<00:01:03.630> to<00:01:03.930> see<00:01:04.170> if<00:01:04.640> oh<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:06.390> didn't<00:01:06.869> turn<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.140> on<00:01:07.259> I

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
this to see if oh I didn't turn it on I

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.230 
this to see if oh I didn't turn it on I
bought<00:01:08.009> this<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.310> see<00:01:08.490> if<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.729> can<00:01:08.880> get<00:01:09.000> super

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
bought this to see if I can get super

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.389 
bought this to see if I can get super
cheap<00:01:09.570> ps3<00:01:10.049> controller<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.619> have<00:01:10.890> every

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 
cheap ps3 controller that have every

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:12.830 
cheap ps3 controller that have every
feature<00:01:11.609> that<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:11.939> wanted<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.329> ps3<00:01:12.600> controller

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
feature that I wanted a ps3 controller

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.649 
feature that I wanted a ps3 controller
and<00:01:13.609> stuff<00:01:14.609> like<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.060> think<00:01:15.240> what<00:01:15.570> I'm

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
and stuff like that I think what I'm

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.120 
and stuff like that I think what I'm
actually<00:01:15.810> gonna<00:01:16.049> end<00:01:16.140> up<00:01:16.320> using<00:01:16.469> this<00:01:16.740> for<00:01:17.009> is

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
actually gonna end up using this for is

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.010 
actually gonna end up using this for is
taking<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.820> screws<00:01:18.090> on<00:01:18.270> using<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.689> screws

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
taking the screws on using the screws

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.090 
taking the screws on using the screws
but<00:01:19.859> um<00:01:20.210> overall<00:01:21.210> it's<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.740> controller

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
but um overall it's the controller

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.389 
but um overall it's the controller
itself<00:01:23.490> actually<00:01:23.789> isn't<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.420> bad<00:01:25.399> these

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
itself actually isn't that bad these

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:28.849 
itself actually isn't that bad these
sticks<00:01:26.850> have<00:01:27.149> loads<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.840> dead<00:01:28.079> zones<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.740> if

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:28.859 
sticks have loads of dead zones and if

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:30.230 
sticks have loads of dead zones and if
you<00:01:28.950> guys<00:01:29.069> don't<00:01:29.280> know<00:01:29.460> what<00:01:29.490> dead<00:01:29.729> zones<00:01:29.999> are

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
you guys don't know what dead zones are

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.529 
you guys don't know what dead zones are
dead<00:01:31.170> zones<00:01:31.200> are<00:01:31.740> where<00:01:31.950> like<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.850> play<00:01:33.149> on<00:01:33.270> 10

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
dead zones are where like I play on 10

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:34.969 
dead zones are where like I play on 10
sensitivity<00:01:34.170> I'll<00:01:34.289> move<00:01:34.469> down<00:01:34.499> a<00:01:34.679> little<00:01:34.859> bit

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
sensitivity I'll move down a little bit

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.929 
sensitivity I'll move down a little bit
here<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:36.409> so<00:01:37.409> essentially<00:01:38.069> when<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.700> move

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
here and so essentially when you move

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.090 
here and so essentially when you move
the<00:01:39.149> stick<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.659> aim<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.200> stuff<00:01:40.409> like<00:01:40.590> that

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
the stick to aim and stuff like that

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.580 
the stick to aim and stuff like that
when<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.490> make<00:01:41.729> this<00:01:41.909> small<00:01:42.420> movement<00:01:43.109> up<00:01:43.259> like

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
when I make this small movement up like

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.639 
when I make this small movement up like
that<00:01:43.799> so<00:01:44.249> then<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.490> can<00:01:44.700> hit<00:01:44.819> a<00:01:44.880> target<00:01:45.179> it<00:01:45.810> uh<00:01:45.869> it

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
that so then I can hit a target it uh it

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.109 
that so then I can hit a target it uh it
won't<00:01:46.829> do<00:01:47.100> anything<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:47.700> I'll<00:01:47.759> move<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.060> a

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
won't do anything so I'll move it a

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.029 
won't do anything so I'll move it a
little<00:01:48.359> bit<00:01:48.780> more<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.289> then<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.590> whole

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
little bit more and then the whole

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.620 
little bit more and then the whole
screen<00:01:50.369> will<00:01:50.579> jolt<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:52.280> it's<00:01:53.280> it's<00:01:53.939> not<00:01:54.240> fun

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
screen will jolt and it's it's not fun

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.590 
screen will jolt and it's it's not fun
so<00:01:54.959> um<00:01:55.319> if<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.859> need<00:01:56.100> ps3<00:01:56.609> controllers<00:01:57.090> for

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
so um if you need ps3 controllers for

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.300 
so um if you need ps3 controllers for
really<00:01:58.409> simple<00:01:58.969> games<00:01:59.969> like<00:02:00.889> like<00:02:01.889> let's<00:02:02.100> say

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
really simple games like like let's say

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.199 
really simple games like like let's say
like<00:02:02.549> a

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:03.209 
like a

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:06.559 
like a
-<00:02:04.490> side-scrolling<00:02:05.490> game<00:02:05.819> like<00:02:06.179> Castle

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 
- side-scrolling game like Castle

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:08.510 
- side-scrolling game like Castle
Crashers<00:02:06.929> or<00:02:07.049> something<00:02:07.409> like<00:02:07.529> that<00:02:07.770> this

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
Crashers or something like that this

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.059 
Crashers or something like that this
controller<00:02:08.940> is<00:02:09.030> great<00:02:09.539> it's<00:02:09.899> not<00:02:10.740> really

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
controller is great it's not really
