I<00:01:00.540> believe<00:01:01.540> in<00:01:01.690> prophecy<00:01:02.820> but<00:01:03.820> it's<00:01:03.970> so<00:01:04.089> rare

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
I believe in prophecy but it's so rare

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.990 
I believe in prophecy but it's so rare
in<00:01:04.570> the<00:01:04.659> Acts<00:01:04.809> of<00:01:04.930> the<00:01:04.989> Apostles<00:01:05.080> that<00:01:05.970> type<00:01:06.970> of

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
in the Acts of the Apostles that type of

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.580 
in the Acts of the Apostles that type of
professed<00:01:07.540> prophecy<00:01:08.020> that<00:01:08.140> predicts<00:01:08.500> the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
professed prophecy that predicts the

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.370 
professed prophecy that predicts the
future<00:01:09.479> it's<00:01:10.479> very<00:01:10.780> rarely<00:01:11.770> I<00:01:12.220> think<00:01:13.380> maybe

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
future it's very rarely I think maybe

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.810 
future it's very rarely I think maybe
two<00:01:14.619> or<00:01:14.710> three<00:01:14.860> times<00:01:15.039> in<00:01:15.250> my<00:01:15.280> life<00:01:15.610> I've

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
two or three times in my life I've

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.660 
two or three times in my life I've
experienced<00:01:16.450> that<00:01:16.950> like<00:01:17.950> a<00:01:17.979> nagger<00:01:18.280> bus<00:01:18.490> and

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
experienced that like a nagger bus and

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.190 
experienced that like a nagger bus and
actually<00:01:19.000> pass<00:01:19.180> only<00:01:19.329> twice<00:01:19.630> that<00:01:19.869> you<00:01:19.990> see

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
actually pass only twice that you see

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.020 
actually pass only twice that you see
him<00:01:20.289> coming<00:01:20.590> up<00:01:20.710> but<00:01:21.520> there's<00:01:21.670> another<00:01:21.909> type

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
him coming up but there's another type

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.880 
him coming up but there's another type
of<00:01:22.180> prophecy<00:01:22.810> mentioned<00:01:23.200> in<00:01:23.320> 1<00:01:23.469> Corinthians

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890
