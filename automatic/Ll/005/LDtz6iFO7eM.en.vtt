itself<00:01:57.190> is<00:01:57.400> not<00:01:57.550> bad<00:01:57.790> it's<00:01:58.060> actually<00:01:58.330> pretty

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
itself is not bad it's actually pretty

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.300 
itself is not bad it's actually pretty
good<00:01:58.750> especially<00:01:59.110> closer<00:01:59.650> to<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.010> end<00:02:00.160> it

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
good especially closer to the end it

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.070 
good especially closer to the end it
gets<00:02:00.430> actually<00:02:00.790> really<00:02:01.060> interesting<00:02:01.570> i<00:02:01.750> would

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
gets actually really interesting i would

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.960 
gets actually really interesting i would
say<00:02:02.230> samus<00:02:02.650> is<00:02:02.770> part<00:02:03.070> of<00:02:03.160> the<00:02:03.280> story<00:02:03.610> when<00:02:03.850> she

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
say samus is part of the story when she

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.120 
say samus is part of the story when she
talks<00:02:04.270> and<00:02:04.600> shit<00:02:05.200> can<00:02:05.500> get<00:02:05.680> a<00:02:05.710> little<00:02:05.920> boring

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
talks and shit can get a little boring

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.830 
talks and shit can get a little boring
but<00:02:06.250> i<00:02:06.400> never<00:02:06.670> found<00:02:06.880> it<00:02:07.060> awful<00:02:07.420> and<00:02:07.600> i<00:02:07.660> don't

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
but i never found it awful and i don't

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.120 
but i never found it awful and i don't
think<00:02:07.900> the<00:02:08.110> voice<00:02:08.260> acting<00:02:08.649> is<00:02:08.710> really<00:02:08.890> that

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
think the voice acting is really that

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.280 
think the voice acting is really that
bad<00:02:09.280> as<00:02:09.550> some<00:02:09.700> people<00:02:09.970> are<00:02:10.060> saying<00:02:10.210> it<00:02:10.450> is<00:02:10.510> it's

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
bad as some people are saying it is it's

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.200 
bad as some people are saying it is it's
not<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:11.530> greatest<00:02:11.800> story<00:02:12.310> it<00:02:12.580> follows<00:02:13.180> a

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
not the greatest story it follows a

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.460 
not the greatest story it follows a
pretty<00:02:13.480> sure<00:02:13.600> each<00:02:13.720> story<00:02:13.960> of<00:02:14.110> fucking<00:02:14.440> shit

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
pretty sure each story of fucking shit

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.990 
pretty sure each story of fucking shit
up<00:02:14.650> until<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.130> very<00:02:15.160> end<00:02:15.400> where<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.670> twist

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
up until the very end where the twist

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.810 
up until the very end where the twist
happened<00:02:16.360> but<00:02:17.080> overall<00:02:17.800> it's<00:02:18.160> a<00:02:18.370> Nintendo

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
happened but overall it's a Nintendo

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.190 
happened but overall it's a Nintendo
game<00:02:18.850> with<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:19.450> damn<00:02:19.750> story<00:02:21.840> that's<00:02:22.840> what<00:02:23.080> I'm

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
game with the damn story that's what I'm

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.010 
game with the damn story that's what I'm
saying<00:02:23.560> so<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.430> voice<00:02:24.550> acting<00:02:25.000> is<00:02:25.030> fine<00:02:25.270> the

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
saying so the voice acting is fine the

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.320 
saying so the voice acting is fine the
twist<00:02:26.380> is<00:02:26.470> actually<00:02:26.800> really<00:02:26.920> good<00:02:27.190> overall<00:02:28.150> I

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
twist is actually really good overall I

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.150 
twist is actually really good overall I
can't<00:02:28.630> say<00:02:28.810> much<00:02:28.990> bad<00:02:29.230> about<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.560> story<00:02:29.830> other

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
can't say much bad about the story other

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.100 
can't say much bad about the story other
than<00:02:30.280> its<00:02:30.670> it<00:02:30.880> follows<00:02:31.270> a<00:02:31.360> basic<00:02:31.690> structure<00:02:32.080> of

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
than its it follows a basic structure of

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.930 
than its it follows a basic structure of
kill<00:02:32.770> everything<00:02:33.040> that's<00:02:33.310> on<00:02:33.400> your<00:02:33.550> way<00:02:33.670> until

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
never seen a wii game be so smooth it

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.410 
never seen a wii game be so smooth it
reminds<00:03:05.650> me<00:03:05.739> of<00:03:05.890> like<00:03:06.010> god<00:03:06.310> of<00:03:06.459> war<00:03:06.610> 3<00:03:06.940> it's

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
reminds me of like god of war 3 it's

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.150 
reminds me of like god of war 3 it's
just<00:03:07.570> very<00:03:07.690> smooth<00:03:08.050> have<00:03:08.350> a<00:03:08.380> attack<00:03:08.950> and

just very smooth have a attack and
everything<00:03:09.459> and<00:03:09.520> it<00:03:09.610> works<00:03:09.790> really<00:03:09.970> well

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
everything and it works really well

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.540 
everything and it works really well
overall<00:03:11.410> the<00:03:11.500> graphics<00:03:11.860> are<00:03:11.950> great<00:03:12.100> to<00:03:12.250> design

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
overall the graphics are great to design

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.460 
overall the graphics are great to design
is<00:03:12.700> cool<00:03:12.910> it's<00:03:13.060> very<00:03:13.120> Metroid<00:03:13.690> like<00:03:13.900> obviously

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
is cool it's very Metroid like obviously

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.590 
is cool it's very Metroid like obviously
and<00:03:14.820> definitely<00:03:15.820> keeps<00:03:16.030> that<00:03:16.209> but<00:03:16.390> it<00:03:16.480> does

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
and definitely keeps that but it does

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.420 
and definitely keeps that but it does
have<00:03:16.780> environments<00:03:17.320> like<00:03:17.350> snow<00:03:17.739> and<00:03:17.980> far<00:03:18.130> some

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
have environments like snow and far some

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.280 
have environments like snow and far some
stuff<00:03:18.700> to<00:03:18.850> keep<00:03:18.970> it<00:03:19.150> fresh<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.959> only<00:03:20.110> thing<00:03:20.230> I

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
stuff to keep it fresh the only thing I

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.660 
stuff to keep it fresh the only thing I
really<00:03:20.500> have<00:03:20.590> to<00:03:20.650> say<00:03:20.830> bad<00:03:21.040> is<00:03:21.220> that<00:03:21.250> a<00:03:21.430> lot<00:03:21.610> of

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
really have to say bad is that a lot of

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.660 
really have to say bad is that a lot of
the<00:03:22.030> if<00:03:22.390> there<00:03:22.989> is<00:03:23.140> no<00:03:23.290> forest<00:03:23.739> or<00:03:23.920> swamp<00:03:24.310> or

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
the if there is no forest or swamp or

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.699 
the if there is no forest or swamp or
snow<00:03:25.180> a<00:03:25.420> lot<00:03:25.810> of<00:03:25.959> the<00:03:26.050> area<00:03:26.350> looks<00:03:26.530> like<00:03:26.680> a

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
snow a lot of the area looks like a

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.220 
snow a lot of the area looks like a
boring<00:03:27.040> ass<00:03:27.280> ship<00:03:27.640> that's<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:28.690> only<00:03:28.930> really

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
boring ass ship that's the only really

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.300 
boring ass ship that's the only really
negative<00:03:29.530> thing<00:03:29.650> I<00:03:29.680> have<00:03:29.800> to<00:03:29.830> say<00:03:29.920> about<00:03:30.130> the

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
negative thing I have to say about the

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.710 
negative thing I have to say about the
graphics<00:03:30.670> other<00:03:30.850> than<00:03:31.090> that<00:03:31.239> I<00:03:31.420> think<00:03:31.450> it's

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
graphics other than that I think it's

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:48.540 
graphics other than that I think it's
some<00:03:31.870> of<00:03:31.900> the<00:03:31.989> best<00:03:32.050> graphics<00:03:32.620> on<00:03:32.739> the<00:03:32.860> week

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:56.270 

Oh

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.680 

the<00:03:57.280> gameplay<00:03:57.490> is<00:03:57.760> basically<00:03:58.240> broken<00:03:58.480> up<00:03:58.660> to

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
the gameplay is basically broken up to

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.480 
the gameplay is basically broken up to
two<00:03:58.900> things<00:03:59.110> one<00:03:59.560> is<00:03:59.830> very<00:04:00.130> similar<00:04:00.370> to

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 
two things one is very similar to

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.370 
two things one is very similar to
Metroid<00:04:00.940> Prime<00:04:00.970> you<00:04:01.630> basically<00:04:01.810> go<00:04:02.170> on<00:04:02.290> the

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
Metroid Prime you basically go on the

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.930 
Metroid Prime you basically go on the
first<00:04:02.560> person<00:04:02.980> mode<00:04:03.100> and<00:04:03.370> you<00:04:03.430> shoot<00:04:03.640> the<00:04:03.790> shit

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
first person mode and you shoot the shit

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
out of the bad guys and this is where

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.690 
out of the bad guys and this is where
you<00:04:05.320> can<00:04:05.440> use<00:04:05.470> your<00:04:05.680> missiles<00:04:06.100> and<00:04:06.310> sometimes

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
you can use your missiles and sometimes

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.160 
you can use your missiles and sometimes
only<00:04:07.030> bad<00:04:07.360> guys<00:04:07.570> are<00:04:07.750> affected<00:04:08.050> by<00:04:08.080> the

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
only bad guys are affected by the

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.510 
only bad guys are affected by the
missiles<00:04:08.560> you<00:04:08.590> get<00:04:08.770> the<00:04:08.890> idea<00:04:08.920> you'll<00:04:09.340> be

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520

going to first personal I and boss

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.250 
going to first personal I and boss
fights<00:04:11.670> however<00:04:12.670> you<00:04:13.360> also<00:04:13.390> have<00:04:13.840> this<00:04:13.960> other

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
fights however you also have this other

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.170 
fights however you also have this other
mode<00:04:14.680> which<00:04:14.830> is<00:04:14.860> basically<00:04:15.340> like<00:04:15.460> 2d<00:04:16.000> Metroid

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
mode which is basically like 2d Metroid

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.199 
mode which is basically like 2d Metroid
but<00:04:16.660> in<00:04:16.750> the<00:04:16.870> 3d<00:04:17.230> realm<00:04:17.709> feels<00:04:18.640> very<00:04:18.970> much<00:04:19.150> like

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
but in the 3d realm feels very much like

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.660 
but in the 3d realm feels very much like
the<00:04:20.109> older<00:04:20.320> Metroid<00:04:20.620> and<00:04:20.739> a<00:04:21.130> little<00:04:21.340> bit<00:04:21.489> mix

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:21.670 
the older Metroid and a little bit mix

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:22.800 
the older Metroid and a little bit mix
of<00:04:21.820> Ninja<00:04:22.090> Gaiden<00:04:22.210> because<00:04:22.480> you<00:04:22.570> can<00:04:22.720> do

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
of Ninja Gaiden because you can do

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.690 
of Ninja Gaiden because you can do
finishers<00:04:23.260> to<00:04:23.380> enemies<00:04:23.710> and<00:04:23.860> stuff<00:04:24.070> it's<00:04:24.310> very

finishers to enemies and stuff it's very

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.460 
finishers to enemies and stuff it's very
quick<00:04:25.090> battle<00:04:25.480> system<00:04:25.810> it's<00:04:25.990> very<00:04:26.200> easy

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
quick battle system it's very easy

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.320 
quick battle system it's very easy
there's<00:04:27.130> a<00:04:27.190> lock<00:04:27.400> on<00:04:27.550> target<00:04:28.030> so<00:04:28.150> you<00:04:28.210> don't

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
the morphing ball you basically turn

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.680 
the morphing ball you basically turn
into<00:04:45.280> a<00:04:45.490> ball<00:04:45.730> and<00:04:45.880> these<00:04:46.240> are<00:04:46.390> mostly<00:04:46.510> used

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
into a ball and these are mostly used

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.360 
into a ball and these are mostly used
for<00:04:46.960> puzzles<00:04:47.410> but<00:04:47.560> they<00:04:47.680> also<00:04:47.860> have<00:04:48.130> you<00:04:48.160> know

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
for puzzles but they also have you know

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.159 
for puzzles but they also have you know
their<00:04:48.910> own<00:04:49.030> attacks<00:04:49.419> like<00:04:49.630> dropping<00:04:49.870> bombs

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
their own attacks like dropping bombs

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:52.440 
their own attacks like dropping bombs
around<00:04:50.470> enemies<00:04:50.980> and<00:04:51.130> so<00:04:51.250> on<00:04:51.430> so<00:04:51.640> it's<00:04:52.090> cool<00:04:52.300> to

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
around enemies and so on so it's cool to

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:53.760 
around enemies and so on so it's cool to
have<00:04:52.480> a<00:04:52.600> like<00:04:52.990> three<00:04:53.320> different<00:04:53.500> type<00:04:53.740> of

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
have a like three different type of

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.230 
have a like three different type of
gameplay<00:04:54.040> where<00:04:54.340> you're<00:04:54.490> playing<00:04:54.730> the

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
gameplay where you're playing the

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.000 
gameplay where you're playing the
negatives<00:04:55.690> really<00:04:55.990> for<00:04:56.140> the<00:04:56.200> gameplay<00:04:56.620> in<00:04:56.860> my

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
negatives really for the gameplay in my

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.530 
negatives really for the gameplay in my
opinion<00:04:57.280> is<00:04:57.490> the<00:04:57.520> first<00:04:57.940> person<00:04:58.270> shooter

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
opinion is the first person shooter

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.030 
opinion is the first person shooter
basically<00:04:58.990> a<00:04:59.020> Metroid<00:04:59.380> Prime<00:04:59.410> gameplay<00:04:59.980> you

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
basically a Metroid Prime gameplay you

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.680 
basically a Metroid Prime gameplay you
can't<00:05:00.370> move<00:05:00.550> while<00:05:00.880> you<00:05:00.970> shoot<00:05:01.240> now<00:05:01.510> that's

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
can't move while you shoot now that's

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.690 
can't move while you shoot now that's
due<00:05:01.960> to<00:05:02.169> the<00:05:02.470> limitation<00:05:03.010> of<00:05:03.100> one<00:05:03.310> controller

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
due to the limitation of one controller

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.840 
due to the limitation of one controller
but<00:05:04.450> it's<00:05:05.080> it<00:05:05.680> works<00:05:06.040> good<00:05:06.280> enough<00:05:06.550> that<00:05:06.700> yet

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
but it's it works good enough that yet

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.520 
but it's it works good enough that yet
gets<00:05:07.090> the<00:05:07.180> job<00:05:07.360> done<00:05:07.419> but<00:05:07.780> moving<00:05:08.350> and

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
gets the job done but moving and

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:09.630 
gets the job done but moving and
shooting<00:05:08.770> would<00:05:09.100> have<00:05:09.250> been<00:05:09.370> much<00:05:09.580> better

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
shooting would have been much better

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.580 
shooting would have been much better
idea<00:05:10.150> i<00:05:10.419> know<00:05:10.540> they<00:05:10.870> limited<00:05:11.229> it<00:05:11.290> to<00:05:11.380> one

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
idea i know they limited it to one

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.800 
idea i know they limited it to one
controller<00:05:11.950> and<00:05:12.160> make<00:05:12.250> it<00:05:12.370> easier<00:05:12.669> but<00:05:13.330> really

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
controller and make it easier but really

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.060 
controller and make it easier but really
it<00:05:13.900> is<00:05:14.020> frustrating<00:05:14.229> when<00:05:14.620> you<00:05:14.710> have<00:05:14.830> to<00:05:14.919> stand

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
it is frustrating when you have to stand

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.230 
it is frustrating when you have to stand
there<00:05:15.220> and<00:05:15.310> shoot<00:05:15.520> at<00:05:15.669> the<00:05:15.760> enemy<00:05:15.790> and<00:05:16.150> they're

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
there and shoot at the enemy and they're

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.490 
there and shoot at the enemy and they're
shooting<00:05:16.540> missiles<00:05:16.840> at<00:05:16.990> you<00:05:17.110> and<00:05:17.260> there's<00:05:17.380> no

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
shooting missiles at you and there's no

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.930 
shooting missiles at you and there's no
way<00:05:17.620> you<00:05:17.680> can<00:05:17.830> dodge<00:05:18.010> unless<00:05:18.340> you<00:05:18.460> get<00:05:18.580> out<00:05:18.790> of

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
way you can dodge unless you get out of

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.760
