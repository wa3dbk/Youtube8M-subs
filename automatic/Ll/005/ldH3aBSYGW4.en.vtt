00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 we will explain how to extract the data 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.890
 and make a backup when 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.160
 our laptop has broken and does not start 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.500
 and here we see that we try to start the 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.730
 laptop and it does not let us in this case is 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.150
 make a sidewalk I aspired to be able to take 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.310
 the data when it does not start 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.800
 we will need to extract the hard drive and 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.050
 for this we will need in the case of 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.609
 this laptop a screwdriver 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.260
 star once we have a disk 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.300
 hard extracted as we're going to explain to 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.690
 then we will need an adapter 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.090
 of jump usb to be able to connect it to 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.280
 another team and make a copy of 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.680
 security to the carlos to extract the 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.230
 hard drive we will go around the 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.960
 portable we will turn off and we will remove 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.060
 all the screws that it carries 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.950
 the back part 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.300
 and a few of us will take off with a 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.990
 star screwdriver 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.840
 we see all those who carry 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.610
 and we are going to be removing to be able 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.140
 remove the lid once we have the 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.390
 removed screws let's go lifting 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.030
 cover it carefully because in the part 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.790
 from behind carries the antenna connection 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.210
 good wifi we will see raise with 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.210
 watch out 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.009
 and here we see 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.280
 that carries the wifi antenna connected to the 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.280
 stage 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.680
 and it is disconnected at all 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.830
 connectors though to remove the disk 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:33.460
 hard is not needed here goes the hard drive 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:38.800
 let's remove this sticker 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:40.870
 while we put it on it is sata 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.150
 but to remove it and remove this 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.910
 screw here we have removed the 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.690
 screw here and another screw we can 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.690
 take out the hard drive 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.210
 we remove the connector 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.280
 and here we have the hard drive that now 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.210
 we will connect using the adapter 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:11.390
 pay usb to another computer to try 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:15.880
 extract the data we will connect the disk 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.880
 hard to sata usb adapter 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.100
 but we will connect the usb cable 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.000
 the power cable 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.710
 and we will connect the adapter 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.710
 to a team 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.810
 we will wait for the equipment to detect it 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:56.150
 If the hard disk is not damaged, what 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.090
 will have detected and we will open the 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.310
 windows explorer and there will be us 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.829
 added a new disk drive in the 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.010
 If it does not appear, we can open 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:09.620
 the control panel tools 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.950
 administrative team administrator 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:16.260
 we would go to record management 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.390
 and the normal thing is to appear here 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.940
 as a unit drive more than the computer 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.370
 in our case the one that has just detected 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.980
 is unit g if you have not assigned it 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.870
 letter of unity we can assign it to 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.170
 us pressing with the right button 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.150
 change the drive letter and if it has not 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.840
 detected does not appear here we can 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.950
 do a disc scan by clicking on 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.140
 re-examine all the disks 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.150
 and if it does not appear to 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.069
 none of these ways could be 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.720
 because the disk drive is broken 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.300
 If so, we would have to use 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.250
 some extraction tool 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.200
 data in case of disk failure our 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.390
 case as we say the unit has detected 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.760
 that we can close the administrator 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.200
 of discs we go to the unit and 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.269
 we actually see that the data is 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.700
 of the laptop 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.860
 now we would have to copy those 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.720
 folders that we want the ones that contain 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.760
 the data that we want to save by 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.950
 example the user folder 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.769
 and paste it into one of the hard disks of 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:20.010
 our team if we do not have access to 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.199
 Sometimes it happens depending on the security 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.860
 I had the folder on the computer 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:24.990
 laptop 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.699
 We will have to make some owners of 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.580
 the folder for it we will press with the 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:31.020
 Right mouse button properties us 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.940
 we would go to the security tab 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.940
 click on advanced options 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.540
 we would go to the owner tab and 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.550
 here what we would do would be to make ourselves 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.860
 owners of the folder for it 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.360
 press on the edit button 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.430
 we will select the administrators group 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.680
 we will mark the option to replace 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:53.510
 owner in sub containers and 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.510
 objects click on accept 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.580
 the process will start what it will do 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.040
 will go through all the files of the 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.780
 selected folder and set as 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.430
 owner the group of administrators 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.350
 of this team in this way already 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.240
 we would have access to this folder once 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.960
 that the process ends click on 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.800
 to accept 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.529
 and we will have access to the folder and its 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.109
 team folders 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:21.749
 in this way as I say we could copy 

00:05:19.109 --> 00:05:23.459
 what we want and copy it to another 

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:27.209
 hard disk of our team and already 

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:28.979
 we would have saved the information if the 

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:31.619
 Hard disk is not varied and we want 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:33.689
 try to repair the laptop we will have 

00:05:31.619 --> 00:05:35.489
 to reconnect it on the laptop 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:38.279
 putting the screws that we have removed 

00:05:35.489 --> 00:05:41.279
 of the cover logically connecting it to the 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:42.989
 jump out of the laptop and try to do 

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:46.309
 a reinstallation of the operating system 

00:05:42.989 --> 00:05:46.309
 to see if we can recover
