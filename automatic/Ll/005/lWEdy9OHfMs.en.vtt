but this little part right here goes

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.900 
but this little part right here goes
down<00:04:17.910> towards<00:04:18.299> the<00:04:18.419> bottom<00:04:18.570> so<00:04:19.609> then<00:04:20.609> put<00:04:20.820> it

clips<00:04:29.160> are<00:04:29.310> gonna<00:04:29.430> be<00:04:30.050> where<00:04:31.050> these<00:04:31.169> lines<00:04:31.440> are

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
clips are gonna be where these lines are

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.320 
clips are gonna be where these lines are
basically<00:04:31.830> and<00:04:32.490> then<00:04:32.639> that<00:04:32.789> one<00:04:33.030> little<00:04:33.240> piece

basically and then that one little piece
is<00:04:33.510> gonna<00:04:33.630> be<00:04:33.690> little<00:04:33.900> bit<00:04:33.990> further<00:04:34.169> up<00:04:34.260> here

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
is gonna be little bit further up here

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.800 
is gonna be little bit further up here

and reverse sign a lot shit it comes off
as<00:07:01.500> one<00:07:02.060> so<00:07:03.060> I<00:07:03.090> got<00:07:03.420> to<00:07:03.570> figure<00:07:03.720> out<00:07:03.930> how<00:07:04.020> to<00:07:04.190> how

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:05.190 
as one so I got to figure out how to how

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.630 
as one so I got to figure out how to how
to<00:07:05.280> do<00:07:05.430> that<00:07:05.640> without<00:07:05.910> covering<00:07:06.840> this<00:07:07.050> in<00:07:07.260> blue

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:07.640 
to do that without covering this in blue

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.580 
to do that without covering this in blue
but<00:07:08.640> then<00:07:08.790> again<00:07:08.910> I<00:07:09.090> already<00:07:09.450> know<00:07:09.600> how<00:07:10.560> to

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:10.590 
but then again I already know how to

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.950 
but then again I already know how to
drive<00:07:10.860> my<00:07:11.070> car<00:07:11.280> so<00:07:11.610> but<00:07:12.360> I<00:07:12.420> don't<00:07:12.600> need<00:07:12.690> to<00:07:12.750> see

drive my car so but I don't need to see

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.150 
drive my car so but I don't need to see
that<00:07:12.990> I<00:07:13.170> could<00:07:13.440> part<00:07:13.590> is<00:07:13.740> cover<00:07:13.920> this<00:07:14.010> whole

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 
that I could part is cover this whole

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.520 
that I could part is cover this whole
