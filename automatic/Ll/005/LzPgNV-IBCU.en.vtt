00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.733
- I don't know if you know--
you may know this.

00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:03.066
I have my own slot machines.

00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:04.300
You can find them all over
the country,

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.400
just follow the sound that
winning makes, and--

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.500
[laughter]

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.700
You can--actually,
you can check my website

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.533
to find all the places that have
my machines.

00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:12.200
These are two of them--
I stole them last time

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.266
I was at the Aria in Vegas--

00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:16.200
and since I can't go back to
Vegas any time soon,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.900
I thought it would be fun if
I sent one of you there instead.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.433
[cheers and applause]

00:00:23.433 --> 00:00:25.933
Lori!
Come here, Lori!

00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:32.233
[funk music plays]
[cheers and applause]

00:00:32.233 --> 00:00:34.700
- Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.633
My mom wants to know what
you smell like.

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:38.133
- How do I smell?
- You smell so good.

00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:40.366
- Oh, okay.
- Mom, she smells so good.

00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.000
- Yeah.
- She smells so good.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.033
[laughter]
Oh, my God!

00:00:44.033 --> 00:00:46.400
- That's what your mother was
curious about, how I smelled?

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.700
- She just wanted to know how
you smelled.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.333
- All right, well--
[laughter]

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.433
- Oh!
- Okay.

00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:53.600
- Oh, she smells so good.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.666
- Thank goodness I smell good.

00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:58.033
That'd be horrible if you said
"Ooh, it's not good."

00:00:58.033 --> 00:00:59.133
[laughter]

00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:00.733
All right,
so we just watched you sing,

00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:01.833
during the commercial break...
- I--

00:01:01.833 --> 00:01:03.300
- And you knew every one
of those words.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.466
- I have practiced my whole life
with my best friend Sheena,

00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:06.466
singing "Ice Ice Baby."

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.200
We rapped it at my wedding.
- Yeah.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.466
- I love that song!
I know every word.

00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:11.733
I'm even better
than she is at it.

00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:13.133
- Oh.
- I love it.

00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.700
- No, you're very, very good.
- I know, I know I am!

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.800
- You have no need to compete,
you won.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.366
All right...
[laughter]

00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:20.266
So, all right, Lori,
we're gonna play a game...

00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:21.300
- Okay!

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.233
- And if you get
more than six right--

00:01:24.233 --> 00:01:25.833
it's a Vegas-themed--yeah.

00:01:25.833 --> 00:01:27.200
- I got this, I got this.
- It's "Heads Up."

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.366
You've played "Heads Up" before.

00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:29.800
- With my three kids,
Molly, Casey and Sadie,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.900
and we play the kid version,
and we love it!

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.400
- Well, I love you,
for playing the game.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.600
- [squeals]

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.600
- All right, if you get more
than six right--

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.166
- Oh, my God...

00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:39.900
[cheers and applause]

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.333
Oh, my God.
- All right.

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:42.533
- Oh, my God.
- Lori,

00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:44.433
if you win, if you get more
than six right,

00:01:44.433 --> 00:01:46.466
you're gonna get a 3--
3-day, 2-night stay

00:01:46.466 --> 00:01:47.766
at the Aria Resort...
- Oh!

00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:49.766
- And Casino in Las Vegas.
- Oh, ho, ho!

00:01:49.766 --> 00:01:51.500
Oh, my God!
- Where you can play--

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.833
All right, stand on that
little red mark right there.

00:01:53.833 --> 00:01:55.500
I'll stand on mine.
- I'm so good at this, Ellen.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.733
- And you can talk, okay?
- I got this.

00:01:56.733 --> 00:01:57.966
- You don't have to act it out,
you can talk.

00:01:57.966 --> 00:01:59.633
These are Vegas-themed,
and I'll guess, okay?

00:01:59.633 --> 00:02:01.500
- I so got this.
- You're gonna, um... all right.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.966
- You're the best guesser.
We got this, Ellen.

00:02:02.966 --> 00:02:04.233
- I'm the best guesser.
Vegas-themed.

00:02:04.233 --> 00:02:05.466
- Ellen, we got this.
- Mm-kay.

00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:07.366
- Okay.
Okay.

00:02:07.366 --> 00:02:09.333
(As Elvis)
Thank you, thank you very much.

00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:11.366
- Uh, uh...
- Like, the guy that--

00:02:11.366 --> 00:02:13.233
Thank you, thank you,
thank you very much.

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:14.366
Like--
[laughter]

00:02:14.366 --> 00:02:15.866
"Heartbreak Hotel"?

00:02:15.866 --> 00:02:18.233
- Oh, Elvis!
- Yes!

00:02:18.233 --> 00:02:20.366
Ah, you roll them for craps.
- Dice.

00:02:20.366 --> 00:02:22.400
- Yes.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.866
You have to get 21.

00:02:23.866 --> 00:02:26.400
- Blackjack.
- Yes.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.833
Ooh, la, la!
I have feathers everywhere.

00:02:28.833 --> 00:02:30.533
- Showgirls, showgirls.
- Yes, yes, yes!

00:02:30.533 --> 00:02:32.233
- "Ooh, la, la."
- A drink.

00:02:32.233 --> 00:02:33.600
Drink them, and they have,
like--

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.933
- Martini, Cosmopolitan.

00:02:34.933 --> 00:02:35.933
- No, no, no, no.

00:02:35.933 --> 00:02:37.033
- Margarita!
- Yes!

00:02:37.033 --> 00:02:38.400
Yes, yes, Ellen!
- Vegas?

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.333
- Okay...
Uh, you--the deck!

00:02:40.333 --> 00:02:41.900
You have to take the deck and--
- Cards.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:42.966
- They have to--
- The deck of cards.

00:02:42.966 --> 00:02:43.966
- What they do in between
the games.

00:02:43.966 --> 00:02:45.300
- Shuffle.
- Yes!

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.266
Oh, you got it!
Okay.

00:02:47.266 --> 00:02:49.133
She's gonna have a really,
really good one.

00:02:49.133 --> 00:02:50.133
- Bachelorette party!
Wedding!

00:02:50.133 --> 00:02:51.866
A wedding.
- No--yes, yes, yes!

00:02:51.866 --> 00:02:53.000
Yes!

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.433
This is what the Aria is,
my favorite...

00:02:55.433 --> 00:02:56.433
- Uh, uh, casino!

00:02:56.433 --> 00:02:57.966
- [squeals]
- Yes!

00:02:57.966 --> 00:02:59.166
- So good!

00:02:59.166 --> 00:03:01.133
The--the guy--he--
- The dealer!

00:03:01.133 --> 00:03:05.000
- He--what he does with
the cards, he...

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.833
- He...deals them.
- Yes!

00:03:06.833 --> 00:03:07.833
- Yes.
[buzzer sounds]

00:03:07.833 --> 00:03:10.933
[cheers and applause]

00:03:10.933 --> 00:03:12.800
You're gonna go to Vegas!

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.366

Wendy McClendon-Covey.

00:03:25.366 --> 00:03:26.833
I'll see you tomorrow.
Be kind to one another.

00:03:26.833 --> 00:03:27.833
Bye bye.

00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:31.066
[cheers and applause]
