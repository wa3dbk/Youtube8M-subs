00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.549
 hello friends welcome to a video more 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:15.369
 of analog pixel I am raid and in this 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:18.070
 occasion as the title says it I 'm going to 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:20.109
 teach how can you find out if 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.449
 one of those photographs someone else the 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:23.830
 you are using the Internet or 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:27.460
 are stealing or doing something 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:30.130
 undue with the good is very easy I 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.510
 I realized this photograph them 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:36.270
 I am showing example all 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.890
 a company of 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.950
 is not dedicated to making impressions 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.110
 I use my photography in their 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.450
 website then with a little bit of 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.300
 research and with the help of google 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.190
 I could determine what pages as 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.160
 sometimes my 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.700
 photography on your website and good is not only 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.280
 well my country if my photo will use it in 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.410
 other web pages we were to you 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.589
 method would unfold me all the places 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.290
 where it is being used then what 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.300
 first thing we have to do is 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.369
 use photography can be 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.130
 download the photograph and you can 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.810
 use web direct link if you have 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.630
 the art source uses the file 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.220
 original me because this photograph already 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.800
 have a backup is a photograph that 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.990
 I took in 2012 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.150
 I took it with mini with 80's of that 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.370
 then and good the license here 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.380
 I'm clearly putting that I have 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.870
 All rights reserved 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.910
 many people publish their photographs with 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.410
 the creative commons license good if 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.950
 someone wants it can use it from 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:44.340
 that way and all without problems but in 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.350
 this case I was not given credit I did not 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.480
 They asked, they have not even given me 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.460
 no compensation in this regard 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.370
 then this site already has a lot 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.680
 time online and photography and 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.230
 I had identified and wanted to teach them 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.750
 nothing else this how can you give yourself 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.050
 account 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.360
 the way they look for their 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.570
 stolen photographs good if you suspect 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.330
 how well you are using this method 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.650
 them low will easily do what 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.210
 first to be done is to lower the 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.410
 Photography 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.140
 well I tell you if they have the original 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.660
 better I'm just going to keep it to 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.890
 who can download the image though 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.480
 the right button download image as 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.730
 Guardian will save on your desktop 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.730
 it is not necessary to change the name 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:50.750
 here is the downloaded in the photograph 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.750
 now the next step is go to google 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.480
 was here 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.700
 and from here we 're going to google 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.890
 images 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.560
 google is obviously you can type 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.080
 any kind of thing and google you 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.420
 find no but this method works 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.190
 in reverse you publish the photo and 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.900
 it looks for all the references that 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.450
 they contain this photograph then as 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.640
 in reverse engineering then 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.080
 we take the picture the wings the 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.080
 you loose the drag 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.740
 and automatically when the load goes to 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.680
 look for it and you will find 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:36.640
 all the all those pages that 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.460
 do coincidences then here is how 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.170
 I tell them I realized that this 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.180
 company called prints impressions 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.330
 is using my photography in three of 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.740
 your web pages 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:51.220
 to show a 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:54.060
 three tracks both in pressures in the 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.060
 homepage 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:00.720
 I'm using it down here 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.400
 in the section you know more is the 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.540
 right side 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.140
 and stamped I pay you online here is my 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.140
 Photography 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.260
 if my photograph had appeared other 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.180
 pages with more pages is also going to 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.000
 leave here in the search in this case 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.950
 they are three I tell them I realized because 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.600
 access it directly to the page 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:27.740
 because he recommended it a lot but 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:30.260
 I'm a little annoyed by this and I hope 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.930
 that those of stamp take letters in the 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:36.920
 matter and we can give ourselves rules of a 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:39.200
 peaceful but good way without more than 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.120
 to say is an idea a way to look 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.460
 photographs there are also other services 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.030
 and mattin there is but has there not me 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.970
 it's so effective 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.129
 in the same way you can load your 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:56.569
 Photography 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:59.300
 charge your photo ti night in a this 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:06.129
 look for the photographs the only problem 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:06.129
 is that you have but to throne a good 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.150
 It is not always perfect can be 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:15.090
 I prefer to use google images to 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.800
 look for all the pictures that I 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.450
 I feel that they are stealing us good and 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.450
 also here he did not even find anything 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.900
 good good dysfunctional not too 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.730
 there is a google extension for firefox 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.070
 that with the right click to use to 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.870
 find me is in this photograph in 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.320
 internet and do the search and it shows you 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.290
 all coincidences 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:41.170
 and good is the way of searching 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:44.770
 on the internet to find out if someone is 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:49.440
 stealing plagiarizing or making use of it 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:52.540
 nothing that you are not learning wrong 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.670
 today he is getting rich with your 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:57.850
 good photography this is the way that 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:06:00.270
 may be the only way what remains 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:03.340
 is that you contact that website 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:05.770
 or that person directly and then they 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.730
 agree to see what happens 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.730
 It is a matter of 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.840
 I think good 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.090
 whatever it is, but keep in mind 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:23.260
 that if you put a license in 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:25.240
 flickr on 500 px or on another website 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.970
 where are they using licenses 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.320
 creative as for example this guy who 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:31.690
 these are the creative licenses 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.180
 commons and you put them on anyone 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:35.740
 you can grab it the can take the can 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.810
 post on your website always and 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.510
 when I'm giving you credit and that 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.470
 do not modify it there are several types 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:45.460
 of licenses 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:46.690
 I better reserve myself the right to 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:50.320
 done this picture 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:53.140
 I used it to publish it in a post 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.830
 I did of how to mount photographs 

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.420
 in soocer 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.950
 that's why that's why I did the 

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.780
 photography not so much so that what 

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.970
 will use 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.620
 and good here the important thing that it 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:07.080
 use an internal photograph of 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:09.090
 please always the credit of those who 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:12.000
 I have used videos that are 

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:15.240
 please where did they take it so that 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.889
 do not attribute the image as owners 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:20.819
 original 

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:22.590
 If you have any other doubt this 

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:25.050
 they warn to leave a comment I hope that 

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:27.919
 have served this trick and see you 

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.919
 in the next video
