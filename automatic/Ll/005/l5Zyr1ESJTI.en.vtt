00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hello everybody it's fantastic to 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.420
 34 I hope you are well 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.220
 we are now on my channel 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.290
 no matter how you 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.340
 fell on it 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.889
 maybe you fell on it by 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.540
 chance looking for a crack of games or 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.289
 maybe a friend told you about it 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.580
 that would not be bad and so here is the 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.859
 purpose of this video is to present a 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.990
 little bit my chain is what you 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.710
 waiting if you plan to visit a small 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.359
 little chain so I think you 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.489
 will understand if you have you 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.309
 even does the research or if a friend you 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.230
 told you about it 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.120
 it will be mainly crack and 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.579
 tips but sells mostly cracks 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.040
 so we'll have game cracks of 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.520
 software so I'm going to show you everything 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.300
 we will see them in the videos 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:53.579
 in playlists 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.710
 so here's g34 playlist sorry I know 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.989
 not count 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.120
 so there's one for the cracks of 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.149
 another game for the cracks of 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.010
 software they third for videos 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.250
 practices and for tips and a 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.740
 for the various is where I put my 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.810
 but new intro and that's what the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.200
 loose stuff 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.390
 so let's start with the rubric 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.540
 crack games for example we'll go 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.250
 in here you'll see that 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.320
 for now there is a small 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.320
 twenty videos 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.240
 so I'm trying to get out of videos 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.979
 as soon as you have a new game coming out 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.280
 because I know that that makes it 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.900
 always pleasure to people for example 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.619
 in Guyana new games coming out 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.579
 assassin's creed iii or not an exit 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.030
 is that there are many 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.740
 among you surely who would not want 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.310
 they did not want to spend 70 balls 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.420
 for for a game then we could 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.860
 get it for free 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.869
 so if you do not know the cracks 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.759
 welcome down and I think that really 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.840
 you will really liked if you do not 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.719
 are already 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.490
 right in it so I invite you to 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.859
 do a little tour on my channel because 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.899
 that there are really plenty of things finally 

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:12.260
 a lot of things I mean that there are 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:16.709
 things to come 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.120
 that's for sure it's normal so here's 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.739
 example is the last burgeat that he 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.040
 finish what I did there is not very 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.830
 long time 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.580
 just after his release the tomb raider 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.840
 also sniper ghost stuff i said my 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:34.530
 charge I do not know exactly where 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:36.030
 he knew we're going to leave here if not for 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.030
 the software is not so much for 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.010
 the moment here for example as we 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.120
 cracks es sas a video that is a 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.510
 thing is really asked I find 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.569
 that there are really 60% of people on my 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.040
 chain that are there for that so that makes 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.560
 pleasure 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.310
 so that's enough to have two thousand 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.140
 games about 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:00.870
 you have a little software that you 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.500
 allows to lighten your computer from the 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.489
 make more powerful faster 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.850
 good there it's duplicate I do not know 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:11.100
 Why 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:13.250
 finally that I rule that what I 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.250
 do 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:20.390
 no I asked the playlists to yes 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.160
 I'm a little stupid yes, because there is 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.150
 a new presentation I am a little 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:28.360
 lost what I'm used to 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:31.430
 the old one so I take my marks 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.010
 that's it and there is the practical part and 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:39.230
 asus what am I crazy what is 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:40.010
 I'm crazy it's that way 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.930
 example how to create a small 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.680
 thumbnail for youtube if you have a 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.330
 chain also sees how to boost 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.940
 utorrent by more downloads 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.560
 fast as we use mostly rather 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.260
 reindeer on my embarrassment you can use 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.989
 or bittorrent and the others I know 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.209
 not everything but you can use them 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.100
 but for boosts it's just that 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.300
 on the torrent I think so it's not 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.220
 necessarily compatible with others at 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.230
 may be the one with whom jean 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.570
 good I invite you to watch if ever 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:13.400
 Also I use more used not sorry 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:16.070
 utorrent so otherwise for our Belgian friends 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.160
 there is a small tutorial that allows 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.350
 to access the pirate bay 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.090
 when you live in belgium because 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.970
 if you do not know it 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.729
 the Belgian government has blocked this site 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:31.910
 luxury and a people site and that allows the 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:36.890
 free download so illegal 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.850
 that's nice so I think we did 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.919
 a little bit around but I invite you 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.540
 to go and see more in depth 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.930
 to say look at the videos that we 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:47.720
 really interested alesi and do not hesitate 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.090
 not to put green thumbs if that you 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.800
 of course we will not force you 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.240
 you can comment if you understand 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.400
 not that the pockets also just wanted 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.830
 to say a little thank you that makes me do it 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.780
 pleasure and you can subscribe that 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:04.989
 it's super important to you as 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:07.759
 for me since that will allow you to 

00:05:04.989 --> 00:05:10.009
 to be aware that in coming out a 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:13.429
 new video and seeing that I 'm doing it very 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:14.899
 often as soon as one as soon as a game on the 

00:05:13.429 --> 00:05:17.509
 point of going out for example no I 

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:19.129
 already starting to search but my links 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:22.759
 bittorrent but not home and 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:24.169
 all that like that as soon as the crack comes out 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:26.419
 I'll do it to you 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:28.999
 tutorial the same day in principle so 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:30.619
 that's if you ever want me 

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:31.279
 crack a game that is already out there 

00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:32.479
 a very long time ago 

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:33.829
 you can tell me I'll go 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.959
 do a search and if I find I 

00:05:33.829 --> 00:05:41.089
 will do it with great pleasure 

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:44.119
 so here I think it's all so 

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:46.279
 you are not necessarily good at 

00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:47.479
 fear ie if you do not know 

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:49.039
 not used later 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:52.219
 toulouse which are tools 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:55.429
 essential to crack games on 

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:59.059

00:05:55.429 --> 00:06:01.369
