 cylinder mobile blades that 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.490
 adjust to the cylinder surface to 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:06.540
 as ice cream hardens 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:08.430
 the team promises 6 edition 2006 is 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.400
 built with the best materials 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.040

 hermetic jars of Italian origin 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.040
 own design refrigerant circuit 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.620
 made with danfoss parts of france- 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.770
 Brand beater electric motor 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.110
 siemens of europe connection board 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.750
 electric that allows to operate the machine 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.390
 manually if the 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.570
 electronic circuit board has 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.550
 suffered some damage thermal keys and 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.970
 danfoss connectors of the highest 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.970
 quality 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:48.290
 the machine loads under normal conditions 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.290
 6 liters of mixture 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.770
 you choose the hardness of cut in the hard 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:03.580
 matic for the end of the cycle in 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.770
 very quickly and efficiently all 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.040
 freezers machines are checked in 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.980
 service connecting them to this board 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.710
 multi- voltage control during 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.380
 test productions that reproduce 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.620
 the conditions of use of the equipment in 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.030
 any corner of the planet 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.570
 we will now verify the time of 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.720
 cargo processing begins 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:31.210
 manufacturing cycle at the time of 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.210
 cut of the cycle have been fulfilled 7 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.620
 minutes and 11 seconds 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.150
 now we will download the product 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.450
 finished 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.849
 the team's beater has a second 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.220
 speed that allows you to download the 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.930
 ice cream with maximum efficiency to the 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.530
 desired temperature 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.930
 the ice cream was completely discharged 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.959
 getting about 9 liters we measure the 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.890
 temperature that is 85 degrees 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.500
 centigrade 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.680
 the amount remaining after the 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:08.680
 discharge is less than 300 grams on 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.680
 Download time was 50 seconds 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.360
 Y 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:23.040
 prom in 6th edition 2006 can be 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.190
 manufactured according to the specifications of 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.670
 electricity that the customer wants with the 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.370
 condenser of the refrigeration circuit 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.770
 cooled by air or by water for climates 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.500
 very run it is suggested to use equipment 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.990
 cooled to water with the help of a 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:44.240
 Water cooling tower for 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.240
 economize the use of water network 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:51.450
 This table shows the specifications 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.450
 complete of the team 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:11.170
 quality freezer trust and low costs
