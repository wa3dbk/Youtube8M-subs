00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.780
 We are the first generations of parents. 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:15.599
 determined not to repeat with their children 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.420
 the mistakes of our parents and with 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.250
 effort to abolish the abuses of the past 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.480
 We are the most dedicated and 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.449
 understanding 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.210
 but on the other hand the dumbest parents 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.920
 unsure of what has happened in history 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.149
 The serious thing is that we are dealing with 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.969
 smarter children than we used 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:37.530
 aggressive and more powerful than 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.390
 it seems that in our attempt to be 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.340
 the countries we want to have 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.410
 we went from one end to the other so 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.110
 we are the last generation of children who 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.180
 obeyed their parents and the first 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.050
 generation of parents who obey their 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.050
 children 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.079
 the latter were afraid of their parents 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.719
 the first ones that have in the last ones 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.460
 under the command of parents and 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.420
 who live under the yoke of the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.250
 children the worst is the last 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.680
 respect the parents and the first ones 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.439
 accept the children back in with 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.200
 respect to the extent that the perishable 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.909
 replaces authoritarianism with the terms of 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.960
 family relationships have changed 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.259
 radical 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.409
 for good and for evil the effect before 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.380
 those parents whose parents were considered 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.990
 children behaved well obeyed the 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.170
 their orders and were treated 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.500
 respect and good children the children who 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.840
 were formal and venerated their parents more 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.509
 as the hierarchical boundaries 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.570
 between us and our children were 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.060
 fading today the good parents are 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.540
 those who get their kids 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.509
 usami and even though little respect and 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.590
 the children who now expect respect from 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.079
 your parents 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.829
 intending in such a way that they respect 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:01.439
 your ideas your faces your 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:03.120
 preferences and their way of acting lives and 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.720
 in addition the 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.660
 whichever they require for this purpose 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.150
 that is, the roles have reversed and 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.640
 now it is the parents who have to please the 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.440
 children to win them and not the other way around 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.660
 as in the past 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.180
 this explains the effort they make today 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.610
 both fathers and mothers to be the 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.840
 best friends and give everything your 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.130
 fruits 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.090
 say the extremes enter the heat 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.130
 authoritarianism of the past filled 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.620
 replaced from their parents 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.830
 the weakness of the present fills them with 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.620
 fear and less arrested when seeing us so 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.500
 be repeated as they the children 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.420
 need to realize that during childhood 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.780
 we are ahead of their lives as 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.300
 leaders capable of subjecting them when 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.060
 we can not contain you and guide the 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.220
 while they do not know where to turn if the 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.220
 authoritarianism south plant one 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.010
 permissivism suffocates only one attitude 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.800
 firm and respectful relationship will 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.810
 accompany in our suitability for 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.170
 govern their lives as long as they are 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.560
 because we go ahead leading 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.560
 and not behind them loading and surrendering 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.870
 at your will, we will avoid the 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.570
 drowning of new generations of 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.570
 lack of control and boredom in 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:28.230
 sinking the seeming society and the 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:30.570
 without parameters nor of this year the 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.650
 limits to shine that love 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:38.110
 unlimited and deep 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.110
