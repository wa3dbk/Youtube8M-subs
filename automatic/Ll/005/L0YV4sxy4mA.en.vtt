there's a form inside of a form and the

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.870 
there's a form inside of a form and the
outside<00:00:26.210> form<00:00:26.750> sit<00:00:27.200> two<00:00:27.500> inches<00:00:27.920> below<00:00:28.220> the

outside form sit two inches below the
inside<00:00:29.810> forms<00:00:30.440> providing<00:00:31.160> a<00:00:31.250> shelf<00:00:31.610> that<00:00:31.940> will

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
inside forms providing a shelf that will

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.979 
inside forms providing a shelf that will
eventually<00:00:33.379> house<00:00:33.679> the<00:00:34.210> the<00:00:35.210> stone<00:00:35.600> that<00:00:35.839> you

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
eventually house the the stone that you

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.560 
eventually house the the stone that you
saw<00:00:36.260> these<00:00:36.829> are<00:00:37.010> expansion<00:00:37.879> joints<00:00:38.359> this

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
saw these are expansion joints this

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.750 
saw these are expansion joints this
allows<00:00:38.960> the<00:00:39.199> concrete<00:00:39.469> to<00:00:39.949> expand<00:00:40.519> and

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
allows the concrete to expand and

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.599 
allows the concrete to expand and
contract<00:00:40.909> and<00:00:41.739> slide<00:00:42.909> and<00:00:43.909> you'll<00:00:44.210> show<00:00:44.539> you<00:00:44.600> a

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:45.609 
contract and slide and you'll show you a

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:48.069 
contract and slide and you'll show you a
show<00:00:46.609> you<00:00:46.670> that<00:00:46.909> later<00:00:47.149> but<00:00:47.390> it<00:00:47.569> allows<00:00:47.870> the

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
show you that later but it allows the

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.500 
show you that later but it allows the
different<00:00:48.260> pieces<00:00:48.710> to<00:00:49.190> move<00:00:49.460> separate<00:00:50.210> of<00:00:50.300> one

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
different pieces to move separate of one

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.680 
different pieces to move separate of one
another<00:00:50.839> and<00:00:51.219> this<00:00:52.219> is<00:00:52.399> the<00:00:52.579> form<00:00:52.940> setup<00:00:53.479> with

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
another and this is the form setup with

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.529 
another and this is the form setup with
the<00:00:53.870> rebar<00:00:54.319> and<00:00:54.620> the<00:00:54.789> compacted<00:00:55.789> class<00:00:56.149> to

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
the rebar and the compacted class to

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:58.899 
the rebar and the compacted class to
aggregate<00:00:57.140> base<00:00:57.469> we<00:00:57.800> use<00:00:57.829> four<00:00:58.339> inches<00:00:58.699> of

00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:58.909 
aggregate base we use four inches of

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:01.180 
aggregate base we use four inches of
class<00:00:59.179> to<00:00:59.479> aggregate<00:00:59.929> base<00:01:00.260> under<00:01:01.159> our

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
class to aggregate base under our

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.319 
class to aggregate base under our
concrete<00:01:01.819> we've<00:01:02.569> also<00:01:02.780> installed<00:01:03.170> four<00:01:04.210> piers

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:05.329 
concrete we've also installed four piers

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:09.730 
concrete we've also installed four piers
about<00:01:06.430> 24<00:01:07.430> inches<00:01:07.729> deep<00:01:08.030> in<00:01:08.299> this<00:01:09.079> because<00:01:09.530> of

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
about 24 inches deep in this because of

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.760 
about 24 inches deep in this because of
this<00:01:09.829> mild<00:01:10.219> slope<00:01:10.790> just<00:01:11.180> to<00:01:11.390> make<00:01:12.229> sure<00:01:12.259> we

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
this mild slope just to make sure we

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.969 
this mild slope just to make sure we
don't<00:01:12.920> have<00:01:13.219> any<00:01:13.640> slippage<00:01:14.570> on<00:01:14.899> the<00:01:15.409> concrete

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
don't have any slippage on the concrete

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.340 
don't have any slippage on the concrete
slab<00:01:16.369> for<00:01:16.729> this<00:01:16.880> driveway<00:01:17.539> it's<00:01:17.960> just<00:01:18.200> an

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
slab for this driveway it's just an

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.620 
slab for this driveway it's just an
insurance<00:01:18.469> policy<00:01:19.189> it's<00:01:19.729> probably<00:01:20.119> not<00:01:20.299> that

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
insurance policy it's probably not that

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.469 
insurance policy it's probably not that
necessary<00:01:21.350> but<00:01:21.619> this<00:01:21.799> is<00:01:21.979> my<00:01:22.219> driveway<00:01:22.579> and<00:01:23.030> I

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
necessary but this is my driveway and I

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.090 
necessary but this is my driveway and I
wanted<00:01:23.810> to<00:01:23.930> make<00:01:24.110> sure<00:01:24.140> that<00:01:24.380> it<00:01:24.710> was<00:01:24.829> going<00:01:25.039> to

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
wanted to make sure that it was going to

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.160 
wanted to make sure that it was going to
we<00:01:25.670> weren't<00:01:25.880> going<00:01:25.969> to<00:01:26.030> have<00:01:26.090> any<00:01:26.270> movement<00:01:26.719> so

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
we weren't going to have any movement so

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.580 
we weren't going to have any movement so
these<00:01:27.439> give<00:01:27.710> us<00:01:27.740> a<00:01:28.009> little<00:01:28.189> extra<00:01:28.539> traction

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
these give us a little extra traction

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.090 
these give us a little extra traction
for<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.619> slab<00:01:31.299> so<00:01:32.299> this<00:01:33.109> is<00:01:33.289> right<00:01:33.500> before<00:01:33.950> the

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
for the slab so this is right before the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.120 
for the slab so this is right before the
pour<00:01:34.399> you'll<00:01:34.729> see<00:01:35.000> two-inch<00:01:35.659> concrete<00:01:36.500> Dobies

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
pour you'll see two-inch concrete Dobies

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.599 
pour you'll see two-inch concrete Dobies
holding<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.560> rebar<00:01:39.560> up<00:01:39.799> you<00:01:40.039> see<00:01:40.250> how<00:01:40.280> its

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:40.609 
holding the rebar up you see how its

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:42.880 
holding the rebar up you see how its
suspended<00:01:41.359> you<00:01:41.509> can<00:01:41.689> see<00:01:41.869> the<00:01:42.020> shadows<00:01:42.469> under

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
suspended you can see the shadows under

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.580 
suspended you can see the shadows under
there<00:01:43.100> and<00:01:43.310> those<00:01:43.969> are<00:01:44.000> concrete<00:01:44.719> Dobies<00:01:45.350> we

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
there and those are concrete Dobies we

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.219 
there and those are concrete Dobies we
put<00:01:45.829> those<00:01:46.009> about<00:01:46.369> three<00:01:46.759> feet<00:01:47.000> apart<00:01:47.060> to<00:01:47.990> make

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
put those about three feet apart to make

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.179 
put those about three feet apart to make
sure<00:01:48.469> that<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:49.820> rebar<00:01:50.270> stays<00:01:50.689> suspended

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
sure that the the rebar stays suspended

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.249 
sure that the the rebar stays suspended
evenly<00:01:52.189> inside<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.969> middle<00:01:53.359> of<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.750> 4-inch

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
evenly inside the middle of the 4-inch

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.590 
evenly inside the middle of the 4-inch
slab<00:01:54.729> now<00:01:55.729> this<00:01:55.969> is<00:01:56.149> the<00:01:56.299> day<00:01:56.479> of<00:01:56.509> the<00:01:56.689> pour<00:01:57.140> and

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
slab now this is the day of the pour and

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.300 
slab now this is the day of the pour and
what<00:01:59.600> you<00:01:59.749> see<00:01:59.990> here<00:02:00.289> is<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:00.530> concrete's<00:02:01.039> been

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
what you see here is the concrete's been

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.060 
what you see here is the concrete's been
poured<00:02:01.640> into<00:02:01.820> the<00:02:02.090> forms<00:02:02.570> and<00:02:02.840> now<00:02:03.499> if<00:02:03.890> you'll

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
poured into the forms and now if you'll

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.190 
poured into the forms and now if you'll
see<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:04.460> guy<00:02:04.609> in<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:04.939> background<00:02:05.539> there<00:02:05.810> he's

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
see the guy in the background there he's

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.690 
see the guy in the background there he's
seeding<00:02:06.829> the<00:02:06.859> aggregate<00:02:07.789> so<00:02:08.060> he's<00:02:08.210> taking

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
seeding the aggregate so he's taking

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.420 
seeding the aggregate so he's taking
quarter<00:02:10.700> inch<00:02:10.940> aggregate<00:02:11.870> or<00:02:12.080> pebbles

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
quarter inch aggregate or pebbles

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.330 
quarter inch aggregate or pebbles
and<00:02:13.840> covering<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:14.989> entire<00:02:15.079> area<00:02:15.980> with<00:02:16.189> the

and covering the entire area with the

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.630 
and covering the entire area with the
pebbles<00:02:16.790> really<00:02:17.360> thick<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:18.049> then<00:02:19.010> you<00:02:19.340> see<00:02:19.610> a

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
pebbles really thick and then you see a

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.910 
pebbles really thick and then you see a
guy<00:02:19.939> there<00:02:20.269> I<00:02:20.299> believe<00:02:20.780> that's<00:02:21.019> a<00:02:21.200> bull<00:02:21.439> float

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
guy there I believe that's a bull float

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.789 
guy there I believe that's a bull float
but<00:02:22.189> that's<00:02:22.430> a<00:02:22.610> float<00:02:22.909> where<00:02:23.329> he's<00:02:23.989> going<00:02:24.409> over

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
but that's a float where he's going over

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.440 
but that's a float where he's going over
the<00:02:24.950> top<00:02:25.189> of<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.610> concrete<00:02:25.849> to<00:02:27.069> lightly<00:02:28.450> push

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
the top of the concrete to lightly push

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.119 
the top of the concrete to lightly push
the<00:02:29.780> pebbles<00:02:30.560> below<00:02:31.189> the<00:02:31.459> surface<00:02:32.030> of<00:02:32.239> the<00:02:33.200> the

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
the pebbles below the surface of the the

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.429 
the pebbles below the surface of the the
wet<00:02:34.340> concrete<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:35.209> here<00:02:35.659> you<00:02:35.780> can<00:02:35.959> see<00:02:36.170> a<00:02:36.200> guy

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:36.439 
wet concrete and here you can see a guy

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:38.589 
wet concrete and here you can see a guy
in<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.739> foreground<00:02:37.220> using<00:02:37.760> foreground<00:02:38.390> in

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
in the foreground using foreground in

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.319 
in the foreground using foreground in
the<00:02:38.720> hint<00:02:38.959> using<00:02:39.470> a<00:02:39.560> hand<00:02:39.859> trowel<00:02:40.220> to<00:02:40.970> do<00:02:41.150> the

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
the hint using a hand trowel to do the

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:44.530 
the hint using a hand trowel to do the
same<00:02:41.569> thing<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.170> detail<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:42.650> edges<00:02:43.340> so<00:02:44.060> he's

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
same thing and detail the edges so he's

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.809 
same thing and detail the edges so he's
wanting<00:02:44.959> to<00:02:44.989> get<00:02:45.230> those<00:02:45.470> pebbles<00:02:45.799> just<00:02:46.430> below

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
wanting to get those pebbles just below

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.449 
wanting to get those pebbles just below
the<00:02:47.030> surface<00:02:47.299> here's<00:02:48.019> the<00:02:48.319> bold<00:02:48.590> float<00:02:49.099> again

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
the surface here's the bold float again

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.729 
the surface here's the bold float again
we're<00:02:50.329> trying<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.599> get<00:02:50.780> those<00:02:50.959> pebbles<00:02:51.260> just

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
we're trying to get those pebbles just

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.830 
we're trying to get those pebbles just
below<00:02:52.069> the<00:02:52.220> surface<00:02:52.430> and<00:02:52.970> no<00:02:53.120> more<00:02:53.420> than<00:02:53.629> that

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
below the surface and no more than that

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.110 
below the surface and no more than that
so<00:02:54.109> that<00:02:54.139> the<00:02:54.440> concrete<00:02:54.769> grips<00:02:55.519> them<00:02:55.879> and

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
so that the concrete grips them and

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.929 
so that the concrete grips them and
holds<00:02:56.480> them<00:02:56.720> well<00:02:56.959> but<00:02:57.889> they'll<00:02:58.159> though<00:02:58.639> that

00:02:58.929 --> 00:02:58.939 
holds them well but they'll though that

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:01.030 
holds them well but they'll though that
way<00:02:59.120> they'll<00:02:59.359> be<00:02:59.420> able<00:02:59.540> to<00:02:59.780> hoot<00:03:00.079> to<00:03:00.439> expose

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
way they'll be able to hoot to expose

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.000 
way they'll be able to hoot to expose
them<00:03:01.400> later<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:02.120> take<00:03:03.049> that<00:03:03.319> thin<00:03:03.680> layer<00:03:03.950> of

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
them later and take that thin layer of

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.300 
them later and take that thin layer of
cement<00:03:04.549> off<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.540> top<00:03:05.810> and<00:03:06.139> expose<00:03:06.980> the

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
cement off the top and expose the

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.460 
cement off the top and expose the
pebbles<00:03:07.730> so<00:03:07.970> here<00:03:08.209> you<00:03:08.359> can<00:03:08.540> see<00:03:08.780> a<00:03:08.810> good<00:03:09.109> shot

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
pebbles so here you can see a good shot

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.470 
pebbles so here you can see a good shot
of<00:03:09.709> how<00:03:09.859> thick<00:03:10.220> they<00:03:10.430> put<00:03:10.670> down<00:03:10.849> the<00:03:11.060> pebbles

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
of how thick they put down the pebbles

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.899 
of how thick they put down the pebbles
and<00:03:11.659> then<00:03:12.439> you<00:03:12.590> can<00:03:12.769> see<00:03:13.010> him<00:03:13.250> working<00:03:13.489> those

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:13.909 
and then you can see him working those

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:16.690 
and then you can see him working those
pebbles<00:03:14.209> just<00:03:14.750> below<00:03:15.109> the<00:03:15.290> surface<00:03:15.530> with<00:03:16.519> the

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
pebbles just below the surface with the

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.800 
pebbles just below the surface with the
trap<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.269> hand<00:03:17.540> trowel<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:18.650> bowl<00:03:19.280> float

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
trap the hand trowel and the bowl float

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:26.259 
trap the hand trowel and the bowl float
okay<00:03:23.319> and<00:03:24.319> CM<00:03:24.709> detailing<00:03:25.430> those<00:03:25.579> so<00:03:25.879> again

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
okay and CM detailing those so again

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.839 
okay and CM detailing those so again
it's<00:03:26.810> a<00:03:26.840> real<00:03:27.079> finesse<00:03:27.620> thing<00:03:27.980> if<00:03:28.190> you<00:03:28.370> drop

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
it's a real finesse thing if you drop

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.300 
it's a real finesse thing if you drop
these<00:03:29.090> pebbles<00:03:29.419> too<00:03:29.900> deep<00:03:30.169> into<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:30.769> mud<00:03:31.040> what

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
these pebbles too deep into the mud what

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.210 
these pebbles too deep into the mud what
happens<00:03:31.760> is<00:03:32.090> you<00:03:32.720> can't<00:03:33.019> expose<00:03:33.470> them<00:03:33.829> you<00:03:34.040> go

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
happens is you can't expose them you go

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.360 
happens is you can't expose them you go
this<00:03:34.489> is<00:03:34.549> so<00:03:35.239> this<00:03:35.419> is<00:03:35.599> the<00:03:35.810> dried<00:03:36.370> concrete

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
this is so this is the dried concrete

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.030 
this is so this is the dried concrete
and<00:03:37.629> they<00:03:38.629> need<00:03:38.840> to<00:03:38.989> let<00:03:39.139> it<00:03:39.290> set<00:03:39.590> up<00:03:39.739> to<00:03:40.010> a

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
and they need to let it set up to a

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.069 
and they need to let it set up to a
certain<00:03:40.489> degree<00:03:40.669> so<00:03:41.299> that<00:03:41.329> when<00:03:41.629> they<00:03:41.780> start

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
certain degree so that when they start

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.009 
certain degree so that when they start
to<00:03:42.260> wash<00:03:42.500> the<00:03:42.829> concrete<00:03:43.430> they<00:03:43.970> don't<00:03:44.299> over

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
to wash the concrete they don't over

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.119 
to wash the concrete they don't over
wash<00:03:45.260> it<00:03:45.590> it's<00:03:46.069> a<00:03:46.190> very<00:03:46.400> fine<00:03:47.239> line<00:03:47.599> between

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.129 
wash it it's a very fine line between

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:50.949 
wash it it's a very fine line between
washing<00:03:49.129> too<00:03:49.400> much<00:03:49.669> and<00:03:50.030> leaving<00:03:50.449> the<00:03:50.569> pebbles

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
washing too much and leaving the pebbles

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.080 
washing too much and leaving the pebbles
sitting<00:03:51.379> up<00:03:51.530> high<00:03:51.769> and<00:03:52.159> when<00:03:52.340> you<00:03:52.459> do<00:03:52.639> that<00:03:52.849> you

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
sitting up high and when you do that you

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.330 
sitting up high and when you do that you
get<00:03:53.299> what<00:03:53.479> they<00:03:53.599> call<00:03:53.810> blowouts<00:03:54.440> and<00:03:54.799> the

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
get what they call blowouts and the

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.399 
get what they call blowouts and the
aggregate<00:03:55.819> will<00:03:56.030> release<00:03:56.449> and<00:03:56.840> then<00:03:56.989> now<00:03:57.349> you

00:03:57.399 --> 00:03:57.409 
aggregate will release and then now you

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:59.890 
aggregate will release and then now you
have<00:03:57.799> holes<00:03:58.129> in<00:03:58.459> where<00:03:59.120> the<00:03:59.269> concrete<00:03:59.569> is

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
have holes in where the concrete is

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.469 
have holes in where the concrete is
showing<00:04:00.409> without<00:04:00.739> the<00:04:00.919> pebbles<00:04:01.370> now<00:04:02.209> they're

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:02.479 
showing without the pebbles now they're

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:05.229 
showing without the pebbles now they're
doing<00:04:02.810> the<00:04:02.989> exposing<00:04:03.799> or<00:04:04.010> the<00:04:04.430> exposing<00:04:05.120> of

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
doing the exposing or the exposing of

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.420 
doing the exposing or the exposing of
the<00:04:05.389> aggregate<00:04:05.900> or<00:04:06.199> the<00:04:06.440> washing<00:04:06.979> so<00:04:07.280> they're

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
the aggregate or the washing so they're

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.860 
the aggregate or the washing so they're
using<00:04:07.750> water<00:04:08.750> and<00:04:09.139> they're<00:04:09.739> using<00:04:10.040> a<00:04:10.510> light<00:04:11.510> a

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
using water and they're using a light a

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.750 
using water and they're using a light a
light<00:04:11.989> broom<00:04:12.709> and<00:04:13.010> they're<00:04:13.129> doing<00:04:13.310> it<00:04:13.489> very

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
light broom and they're doing it very

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.649 
light broom and they're doing it very
lightly<00:04:14.090> just<00:04:14.329> to<00:04:14.690> release<00:04:15.379> that<00:04:15.650> film<00:04:16.159> of
