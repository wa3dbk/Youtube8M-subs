the last button on okay like I said
before<00:01:44.909> it's<00:01:45.329> just<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:45.720> much<00:01:45.840> easier<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.380> do

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
before it's just so much easier to do

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.139 
before it's just so much easier to do
this<00:01:46.740> by<00:01:46.920> hand<00:01:47.280> because<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.850> can<00:01:47.970> make<00:01:48.119> sure

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
this by hand because you can make sure

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.980 
this by hand because you can make sure
that<00:01:48.450> everything<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:48.979> right<00:01:49.979> in<00:01:50.220> place<00:01:50.990> there

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
that everything is right in place there

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.270 
that everything is right in place there
we<00:01:52.110> go<00:01:53.210> one<00:01:54.210> turn<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:55.020> when<00:01:55.680> we're<00:01:55.829> done<00:01:55.979> I'm

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
we go one turn and when we're done I'm

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.709 
we go one turn and when we're done I'm
going<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.460> lay<00:01:56.579> them<00:01:56.700> out<00:01:56.850> next<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.360> each<00:01:57.509> other

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
going to lay them out next to each other

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.510 
going to lay them out next to each other
to<00:01:57.990> make<00:01:58.110> sure<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.409> they're<00:01:58.590> both<00:01:58.770> even<00:01:59.070> and

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
to make sure that they're both even and

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.600 
to make sure that they're both even and
that<00:01:59.610> they<00:01:59.969> both<00:02:00.149> look<00:02:00.390> really<00:02:00.659> nice<00:02:01.610> and

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
that they both look really nice and

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.100 
that they both look really nice and
crisp<00:02:02.969> just<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.390> way<00:02:03.479> they're<00:02:03.630> supposed<00:02:03.780> to

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
crisp just the way they're supposed to

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.440 
crisp just the way they're supposed to
so<00:02:05.040> here<00:02:05.399> I'm<00:02:05.520> going<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.729> put<00:02:05.880> about<00:02:05.969> three

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
so here I'm going to put about three

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.370 
so here I'm going to put about three
knots

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
knots

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.380 
knots
because<00:02:07.560> this<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.429> holding<00:02:08.759> all<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.119> buttons

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
because this is holding all the buttons

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.780 
because this is holding all the buttons
on<00:02:10.190> there<00:02:11.190> we<00:02:11.310> go
