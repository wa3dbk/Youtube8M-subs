00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.670
 hello everyone welcome to a video 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.880
 quite special plants verses zombies 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.419
 garden warfare stands out for many things 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.500
 and one of them without a doubt is the variety 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:21.349
 of game styles that we can get 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.180
 depending on the class we choose 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:27.090
 so what would happen if you had to 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.110
 choose from the most powerful class to the 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.610
 less powerful of the side of the plants 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.800
 it's precisely what I bring you with 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.679
 this video and this time I'm going to 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.530
 show from my opinion which would come 

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:42.899
 being the classes the most powerful class 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.480
 the less powerful side of the 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.140
 I hope you like plants and if they are 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.539
 agreement 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.129
 share what and if you do not tell me what it would be 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.129
 your ideal alignment 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.309
 the most powerful plant for me would come 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:01.100
 being the pea this plant is the most 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.290
 used in all game modes and 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.250
 no wonder it 's a plant 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:10.520
 balanced between power speed reach 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.610
 It is a class with a lot of people are 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.820
 would feel comfortable when you start the game is 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.040
 Easy to use, you do not get too complicated and 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.100
 his skills are very good for 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.410
 play either offensively or defensively already 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.649
 you want to reach high places 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.600
 to establish a defensive turret already 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.000
 whether you want to get somewhere 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.970
 to defend it or to support your 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.369
 comrades this plant is the only one 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.920
 it has a grenade that is 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.259
 easy to dodge used so 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.770
 adequate can surprise many 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.929
 rivals and eliminate them all at once 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.509
 this plant is definitely the best for me 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:53.539
 because it compensates what they are doing 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.789
 a medium and long distance style to 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:59.120
 short distance would not be so good without 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:02.480
 But it 's still possible to use it 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.300
 Remote is a magnificent plant but 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.580
 unfortunately it is very much used and 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.560
 this is due to its great power to 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.560
 you what would be the number one 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.610
 the second most powerful plant for me 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.760
 would be the cactus this unit 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.270
 is designed for medium combat 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.790
 long distance with a few touches 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:29.730
 highly defensive and radial do not 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.280
 show because you have mines that can 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.770
 be useful to cheat 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.260
 the enemies is also a lot 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.840
 utility defending the garden in the 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.670
 modality of gardens and cemeteries 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.830
 has some nuts that serve us 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.750
 coverage for both us and 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.450
 our companions and apart we can 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.510
 use them as a ladder to 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.610
 get to some places a little 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.470
 inaccessible the third skill is the 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.050
 favorite of most users 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.450
 of the cactus because it gives us a garlic that 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.819
 can go through the air attacking the 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.000
 rival make a very powerful air attack 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:08.430
 etcetera etcetera this unit is the most 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.519
 powerful by shooting on the side of the 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.950
 plants then it is very effective to very 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.590
 great distances however its 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.569
 weakness lies in the body combat to 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.599
 body there has no practice 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:24.989
 possibilities and apart that does not support 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:27.060
 a lot of damage but it's a pretty unit 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.790
 interesting for those who are 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.340
 fans of medium and long combat 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.739
 distance and also for those who 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.170
 want to play in a defensive way in 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.810
 gardens and cemeteries for you the 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:43.630
 cactus deserves second place 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.209
 the third most powerful plant for me 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.720
 within this game would be the 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:52.239
 carnivorous plant this unit is very 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.599
 short range capable of eliminating a 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.580
 enemy with a single attack 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:04:00.400
 offering us a unique style that does not 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.980
 had seen in no game before without 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.170
 But you have to be very careful to the 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.250
 time to attack with this unit because 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.660
 once it devours any rival it remains 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.299
 totally helpless during some 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:16.750
 seconds then with this unit is left 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:19.030
 totally ruled out style attack 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.150
 rambo and try to go over the rivals 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.729
 without thinking of a strategy the best 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.340
 way to use this unit is 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:29.820
 combine their skills using 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.310
 traps to catch rivals 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.710
 waiting for the right moment to 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:39.150
 put you underground and get out under 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:41.830
 some unsuspecting rival or simply 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:45.100
 encourage the opponent's moves to 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.180
 be able to take advantage and attack it 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.400
 unity 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.009
 wants a lot of care when it comes to 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.530
 choose a rival because if you attack a 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:55.960
 enemy that is surrounded by companions 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.060
 for the companion of this enemy 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.300
 it's just going to have a dam 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.880
 totally easy though if you 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.970
 use this unit taking advantage of 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.759
 stealth and the chaos of the battle it is 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:12.660
 a very dangerous very much unit that is worth 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:12.660
 worth using 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:19.130
 came to the end of this video with which 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:22.520
 in my opinion it would be the plant 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:24.950
 weaker in the game but eye on 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.050
 say the weakest plant I 'm not 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:31.100
 saying that these are in a unit 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:34.070
 bad indeed the use of this plant in 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:37.340
 many cases will define the victory to 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:40.100
 your favor however this unit has not 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:43.160
 been developed to work alone 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:45.590
 This plant was made to work 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.410
 as the team doctor and to be 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:51.860
 to the care of your colleagues this unit 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:54.800
 is made to work completely in 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.320
 team because if one goes alone 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.680
 This is the plant that generates less damage 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:03.530
 and that holds less damage then it is not 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:06.710
 very wise to walk alone try to be the 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:09.770
 rambo besides its strength lies 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:12.020
 in curing your partners try to 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.960
 do deaths with this plant is very 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:17.660
 difficult because it does not generate much damage without 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.880
 However, if you are close to your colleagues 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:22.730
 you can take advantage of the damage 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.890
 or that they leave in some opponent or you 

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.990
 generate damage or a rival and that your 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:29.300
 comrades take advantage of it to finish 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.400
 but good with this and I approach the 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.470
 end of this video I hope I have you 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.990
 liked and tell me if you agree 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:38.120
 with me or not in the way that I eat 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.990
 from the plants from the strongest to the most 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.310
 weak inside this game if you liked 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.650
 soon I will upload the part 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:48.200
 corresponding of the zombies then 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:52.960
 do not miss it thank you very much and we 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.960
 we see God on another occasion
