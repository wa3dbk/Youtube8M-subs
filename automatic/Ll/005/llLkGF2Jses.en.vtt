your<00:00:36.540> wheels<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.860> way<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.129> works<00:00:38.370> say

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
your wheels and the way that works say

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.850 
your wheels and the way that works say
you're<00:00:39.300> doing<00:00:39.629> heel<00:00:39.930> sides<00:00:40.230> over<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.710> over

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
you're doing heel sides over and over

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.250 
you're doing heel sides over and over
learning<00:00:41.219> them<00:00:41.340> learning<00:00:41.550> them<00:00:42.110> on<00:00:43.110> one<00:00:43.710> side

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
learning them learning them on one side

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.750 
learning them learning them on one side
it's<00:00:46.260> gonna<00:00:46.440> cone<00:00:46.770> on<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:46.950> inner<00:00:47.160> on<00:00:47.579> the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
it's gonna cone on the inner on the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.819 
it's gonna cone on the inner on the
inside<00:00:48.120> lip<00:00:48.329> on<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:49.170> other<00:00:49.289> side<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.710> gonna

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
inside lip on the other side is gonna

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.470 
inside lip on the other side is gonna
cut<00:00:50.160> it's<00:00:50.370> gonna<00:00:50.460> start<00:00:50.789> wearing<00:00:51.000> more<00:00:51.210> on<00:00:51.390> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
cut it's gonna start wearing more on the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.049 
cut it's gonna start wearing more on the
outside<00:00:51.840> lip<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.260> basically<00:00:53.129> what<00:00:53.399> rotating

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
outside lip and basically what rotating

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.049 
outside lip and basically what rotating
your<00:00:54.210> wheels<00:00:54.390> means<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:55.050> taking<00:00:55.530> this<00:00:55.680> wheel

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
your wheels means is taking this wheel

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.389 
your wheels means is taking this wheel
that's<00:00:57.059> code<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.629> inside<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.289> taking<00:00:59.219> it

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
that's code on the inside and taking it

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.930 
that's code on the inside and taking it
off<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.850> swapping<00:01:00.690> them<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.100> when<00:01:02.850> you

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
off and swapping them so that when you

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.000 
off and swapping them so that when you
continue<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.510> do<00:01:03.690> more<00:01:03.989> heel<00:01:04.320> sides<00:01:04.650> when

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
continue to do more heel sides when

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.160 
continue to do more heel sides when
you're<00:01:05.129> learning<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:06.000> because<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.869> gives<00:01:07.049> you

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
you're learning it because it gives you

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.710 
you're learning it because it gives you
more<00:01:07.320> even<00:01:07.590> wear<00:01:07.920> pattern<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:09.060> prolongs<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
more even wear pattern it prolongs the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.240 
more even wear pattern it prolongs the
life<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:10.080> your<00:01:10.170> wheels<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.650> get<00:01:10.770> more<00:01:10.950> bang

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
life of your wheels you get more bang

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
faster put them in the front and you

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.710 
faster put them in the front and you
know<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.640> can<00:01:26.790> rotate<00:01:26.970> front<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.540> back

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
know you can rotate front to back

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.020 
know you can rotate front to back
crisscross<00:01:28.680> anyway<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.430> know<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.759> just

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
crisscross anyway you know you just

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.870 
crisscross anyway you know you just
gotta<00:01:30.210> learn<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.409> way<00:01:31.579> learn<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.729> way<00:01:32.820> you

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
gotta learn the way learn the way you

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.170 
gotta learn the way learn the way you
slide<00:01:33.240> how<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.689> wearing<00:01:34.320> wheels<00:01:34.590> and

slide how you wearing wheels and

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.370 
slide how you wearing wheels and
eventually<00:01:36.180> your<00:01:36.420> wheels<00:01:36.600> will<00:01:36.840> last<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.229> lot

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
eventually your wheels will last a lot

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.609 
eventually your wheels will last a lot
longer<00:01:37.439> than<00:01:38.040> if<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.280> just<00:01:38.310> keep<00:01:38.640> them<00:01:39.439> in<00:01:40.439> the

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
longer than if you just keep them in the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.260 
longer than if you just keep them in the
same<00:01:40.860> place<00:01:41.570> so<00:01:42.570> for<00:01:43.049> Yuga<00:01:43.729> you<00:01:44.729> guys<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.149> are

lot and these are wheel you definitely
have<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.129> rotate<00:02:08.750> if<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.929> want<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.200> longer<00:02:10.649> life

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
have to rotate if you want a longer life

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.940 
have to rotate if you want a longer life
out<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.310> them

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
out of them

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.010 
out of them
and<00:02:13.349> flipping<00:02:14.349> your<00:02:14.440> wheels<00:02:15.970> I<00:02:16.270> don't

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
and flipping your wheels I don't

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.930 
and flipping your wheels I don't
have<00:02:17.230> any<00:02:17.380> Center<00:02:18.040> set<00:02:18.250> wheels<00:02:18.489> with<00:02:18.670> me<00:02:18.760> right

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
have any Center set wheels with me right

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.690 
have any Center set wheels with me right
now<00:02:19.060> but<00:02:19.569> I'll<00:02:19.810> just<00:02:19.840> use<00:02:20.140> this<00:02:20.520> this<00:02:21.520> is<00:02:21.670> a

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
now but I'll just use this this is a

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.089 
now but I'll just use this this is a
race<00:02:21.970> form<00:02:22.360> think<00:02:23.319> that<00:02:23.470> this<00:02:23.590> is<00:02:23.739> if<00:02:23.830> it<00:02:23.950> was<00:02:24.069> a

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
race form think that this is if it was a

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.630 
race form think that this is if it was a
center<00:02:24.459> set<00:02:24.700> wheel<00:02:26.190> again<00:02:27.190> when<00:02:27.520> you're

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
center set wheel again when you're

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.240 
center set wheel again when you're
sliding<00:02:27.910> you<00:02:28.239> wear<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.569> inside<00:02:28.989> lip<00:02:29.290> and

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
sliding you wear the inside lip and

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.600 
sliding you wear the inside lip and
basically<00:02:31.180> all<00:02:31.450> it<00:02:31.540> is<00:02:31.600> you<00:02:31.780> take<00:02:31.989> it<00:02:32.110> off<00:02:32.610> flip

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
basically all it is you take it off flip

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.360 
basically all it is you take it off flip
it<00:02:33.700> around<00:02:34.020> put<00:02:35.020> it<00:02:35.110> back<00:02:35.260> on<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.770> it<00:02:36.040> wears

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
it around put it back on and it wears

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.150 
it around put it back on and it wears
down<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:36.910> bigger<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.870> higher<00:02:38.019> lip<00:02:38.380> or<00:02:39.100> the

sliding and riding around and again just
prolongs<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.370> life<00:02:45.400> your<00:02:45.760> wheel<00:02:45.970> you<00:02:46.510> get<00:02:46.660> a
