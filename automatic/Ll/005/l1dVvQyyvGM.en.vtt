00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
negatives so that's exactly what I did

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.380 
negatives so that's exactly what I did
and<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:37.280> cut<00:01:38.280> them<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.729> scored<00:01:39.060> them<00:01:39.180> already

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390
