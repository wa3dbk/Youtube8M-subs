00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.669

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:07.379

 comment and and because I bring you a like 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.300
 comment and more good basically 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.720
 they have removed a patch as you already know 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.699
 update 1.3 or something like that I do not know the 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.249
 I really do not control much of that but 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.749
 good things that you have already downloaded 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:22.949
 I also have to tell you that a lot 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:24.660
 People told me in the comments 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.329
 I have the texture pack installed 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.980
 from the first day so the subject of 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.409
 that was caught on the play and others was not 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.450
 that's why it's worth it because the texture pack 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:35.400
 as soon as I knew of its existence I 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.620
 download but nevertheless we are going to 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.450
 will see how it goes with the new pack 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.670
 good with the new pack sorry with the 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.830
 new patch let's play one more time 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.410
 in slums duel by teams I brought you and 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.330
 I would still comment on all against all 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.940
 and this time this class was worth the emt 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.620
 7 with the previous item and instead of the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.080
 second weapon he was wearing that was the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.570
 vector in contract 2 this time 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.090
 took the metal in good let's go over there 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.760
 slums panama republic of panama duel 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.830
 by teams and let's see let's see 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.620
 How is it in this game? 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.310
 I'm going to raise the volume a little 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:15.660
 and where we go we go there to see if it 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.670
 load wait to see that they have improved 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.530
 at least to me that I do not drop my 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.140
 play that at the moment 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.450
 I am happy, yes, we are going there 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.060
 between 7 in hand I will upload this a little 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:32.020
 more I am a pro to run while I 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.820
 I return lumen and well let's go throw the 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:39.120
 knife already 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.120
 to start throwing the grenade and inside 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.299
 OK 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.520
 ok there's another one 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.840

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.840
 and now come here now you are going to see 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.690
 good shit for the moment though 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.110
 It sounds silly, maybe I think it's 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:15.730
 kills easier it kills a little easier 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.730
 at least it is the feeling that has given me 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.980
 well let's take us here just for 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.379
 reload you already know that I do not like to be 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.830
 grave dictated my mother the phrase that I 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.830
 they have gotten there 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.299
 well let's go there that do not shoot me 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.310
 OK 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.709
 we continue here normally here 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.170

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.360

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.270
 I am going to recharge this also that I carry the 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:59.000
 extended charger 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:01.660
 and I have to take it there's one here 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.700
 as you see 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.300
 I'm going to destroy this 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.300
 OK 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.490
 I do not know if that will fall on me 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:16.410
 well, nothing happens, the missile arrived 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.410

 moment a 10 to 2 that to be live 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.820
 comment and then it's pretty good for 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.560

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.480
 I tell you that I feel that this map of 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.120
 again you know how good a little is my 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.440

00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:00.120
 however, we will continue 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.120

 let's see, we're going to start 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:24.100
 answer from behind 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.100
 I did not have coverage 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.650
 what I can upload here 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.860

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.169
 pretty good because you can do it well 

00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:42.719
 leave on the subject of response 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.819
 for people who know how to play taking the 

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:48.709
 I answer controlling the best of the best 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:48.709
 said and the truth is that yes 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.050

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.050

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.210
 double low 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:10.129
 host the death machine you say 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:14.139
 blunderbuss takes me to that then if the 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:14.139
 good death machine 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:21.480
 ok goes out there I look for revenge not mother 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.760

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.280
 fuck 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:29.150
 OK 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.150
 beast 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:35.060
 God is going to raise a little sensitivity 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.640
 let's put it to 8 I have to remember 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.080
 also that in this game instead of 10 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.560
 that I think there was a maximum 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:45.040
 hands or 3 and in whites in this game there are 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.040
 14 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.700
 novelty 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.570
 at last 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.289
 we get 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.150
 ballistics 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:15.100
 my mom uncle the cookies cops are not what 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.100
 my own 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:24.940
 god 1711 come go 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.920
 we would have little to win are 75 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.660
 If I'm not mistaken I shit on all uncle 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.750
 where do I go to the machine 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.750
 death 

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:34.129
 fuck 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.600
 I do not know where he came from me 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:46.230
 good 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.230
 they are things that happen 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.970
 it's where you were going 

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:57.690
 my god 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.690
 for luck the cojones 

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:02.590
 that has been bad luck 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.550
 perhaps it was also influenced by the fact that 

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:09.020
 it's a bank but we're going to 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.020
 to say that it was bad luck 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.430
 get off here we're going to wait for you not to 

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:17.320
 I was going to do the tromsoe but good here 

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:18.880
 it stays 1914 

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.860
 finally, the 14th is there 

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.330
 As I had said before, I do not expect anything 

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.340
 you liked the truth is that I'm 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.870
 quite happy with the patch at least 

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.490
 for the moment at the moment I have not been 

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.680
 set the play or anything like that 

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.790
 that nothing here you have this live gameplay 

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.160
 comment and I hope you liked it 

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:35.110
 as I said like and favorites and has 

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.950
 been this case and with nothing more to say 

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:40.760
 elias 360 is dismissed 

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:40.760
 until next time
