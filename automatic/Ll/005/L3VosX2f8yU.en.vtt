00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.980 

we've<00:00:20.010> been<00:00:20.130> having<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.430> lot<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.580> exes

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:01:19.360 

one<00:00:26.990> two<00:00:27.410> three<00:00:27.620> go

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:02:01.970 

you

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:01.980 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:03:10.460 

Oh

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.290 

yeah<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.220> lot<00:03:11.370> of<00:03:11.430> things<00:03:11.670> go<00:03:11.850> really<00:03:12.000> well<00:03:12.240> I

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
yeah a lot of things go really well I

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.760 
yeah a lot of things go really well I
think<00:03:12.510> our<00:03:12.750> biggest<00:03:12.870> thing<00:03:13.170> was<00:03:13.350> being

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
think our biggest thing was being

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.040 
think our biggest thing was being
resilient<00:03:14.160> and<00:03:14.490> coming<00:03:14.760> back<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.150> we're<00:03:15.810> down

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
resilient and coming back and we're down

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.980 
resilient and coming back and we're down
twice<00:03:16.320> and<00:03:16.710> we<00:03:16.770> came<00:03:16.920> back<00:03:16.980> in<00:03:17.310> won<00:03:17.580> both<00:03:17.760> times

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:17.990 
twice and we came back in won both times

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.020 
twice and we came back in won both times
obviously<00:03:18.990> a<00:03:19.260> wins<00:03:19.500> a<00:03:19.620> win<00:03:19.650> but<00:03:20.100> I<00:03:20.130> think<00:03:20.310> we

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
obviously a wins a win but I think we

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.320 
obviously a wins a win but I think we
always<00:03:21.210> have<00:03:21.330> a<00:03:21.360> list<00:03:21.600> of<00:03:21.690> things<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:21.960> work

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
always have a list of things to work

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.300 
always have a list of things to work
their<00:03:23.510> weakest<00:03:23.840> cool<00:03:24.080> so<00:03:24.440> what<00:03:25.010> I<00:03:25.040> think<00:03:25.220> it's

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
their weakest cool so what I think it's

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.280 
their weakest cool so what I think it's
promising<00:03:25.490> a<00:03:25.760> first<00:03:26.000> game<00:03:26.240> all<00:03:26.630> the<00:03:26.900> newcomers

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
promising a first game all the newcomers

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.900 
promising a first game all the newcomers
are<00:03:27.650> nervous<00:03:27.920> I<00:03:28.250> mean<00:03:28.400> all<00:03:28.490> of<00:03:28.520> us<00:03:28.730> are<00:03:28.880> a

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
are nervous I mean all of us are a

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.220 
are nervous I mean all of us are a
little<00:03:28.970> bit<00:03:29.300> nervous<00:03:29.450> first<00:03:29.960> game<00:03:30.110> of<00:03:30.170> the

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
little bit nervous first game of the

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.500 
little bit nervous first game of the
season<00:03:30.440> and<00:03:30.880> everybody<00:03:31.880> wants<00:03:32.090> to<00:03:32.120> do<00:03:32.270> well

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
season and everybody wants to do well

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.730 
season and everybody wants to do well
and<00:03:32.540> I<00:03:32.960> think<00:03:32.990> it<00:03:33.230> would<00:03:33.320> be<00:03:33.350> a<00:03:33.410> little<00:03:33.590> bit

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
and I think it would be a little bit

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.920 
and I think it would be a little bit
tight<00:03:33.980> the<00:03:34.190> first<00:03:34.400> case<00:03:34.610> and<00:03:35.060> then<00:03:35.270> second

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
tight the first case and then second

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.420 
tight the first case and then second
game<00:03:36.050> it's<00:03:36.230> just<00:03:36.410> like<00:03:36.620> playing<00:03:37.070> like<00:03:37.310> we

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
game it's just like playing like we

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.790 
game it's just like playing like we
always<00:03:37.580> have<00:03:37.820> played<00:03:38.120> before<00:03:38.590> just<00:03:39.590> the<00:03:39.680> game

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
always have played before just the game

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.420 
always have played before just the game
we<00:03:40.040> love<00:03:40.250> and<00:03:40.490> the<00:03:40.580> kind<00:03:40.760> of<00:03:40.820> thing<00:03:41.030> settled
