00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:07.350
 hi youtube that's the thing then 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.130
 new little video so this time 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.610
 on the map 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.290
 talat market to bomber always the same 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.710
 toddlers glitch out of the 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.570
 caf 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.619
 and then nice little dots nice 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.119
 to defend the flags so like 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.640
 in the previous video I'm going 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.500
 use vehicles or the drone or or 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.230
 still the environment that back for 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.090
 provide sure euro points so 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.650
 there we put the little building that all the 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.530
 world knows it's weird I've never 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:40.530
 saw nobody go up there finally good 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:42.480
 I've never seen a whole good their age does 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.020
 the thing with the dronne but with a 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.420
 drone I think with a teammate that 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.190
 can be simpler from the benchmarks there 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.280
 it will be necessary to lie down to pick up the 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:59.190
 drone ask them is a bit heavy to 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:01.550
 do it now that he finds the right 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.550
 point 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.500
 me so much 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.770
 Raul has against here to hide 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:23.170
 pit to eat there is that but there seen 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:23.170
 not bad overhangs the streets downstairs 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:37.550
 here it is near them 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:39.800
 always with a vehicle it's a point 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:45.440
 who does not have a great interest in being this 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:47.420
 wind does not have a super seen the good jussie 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.190
 cana who are able to stay 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:54.820
 whole parts without moving for skype 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:58.550
 is a nice little counter with a balcony 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:03.619
 payet entered at the bottom but why good 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:06.860
 not here it's more a glitch because 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.430
 what are we going to say outside 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.430
 from the menu 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:24.420
 that's all suppose a tag to oka at 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.610
 done in December but hey if you fall 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:32.520
 so we can see the street there is a 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:34.440
 good point of people here so here we go 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.120
 on a small ledge sits small 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.100
 roof the little robert convoy there we go 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.900
 building 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:44.480
 we will have recourse has nothing on 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:48.239
 the screen to jump on the bench facing 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.880
 the repetitions of textures there small 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:59.280
 detail for normand we are not supposed 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:03:03.090
 to see this and where we see the street I do not have 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.930
 if it is well done it is possible to 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.840
 go anyway and that's it pretty 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.910
 I played on different servers with 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.380
 his fists is nice so the goal of 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.940
 climb on the building opposite the 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:20.900
 buildings up there that are in limit of 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.900
 the map and we hit a lot of places 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.970
 I 'm not banned yet but 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.970
 good to see you 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.250
 we must ask the drone otherwise 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.810
 not hold 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:40.760
 but hey I can do it very quickly 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.040
 say that once you're up 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.300
 you lie down then you use right 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.940
 to make a small identification of places 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:52.849
 like that the limits we do not see where 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:57.870
 you climbed little trick yet 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:04:06.959
 So here is the nice view from above 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:10.610
 I let you appreciate this kind 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.610
 of place that is very very busy 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:18.200
 good here a little bonus so good part 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.200
 on a server 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.789
 I received a good ratio 

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:24.069
 besides, I 'm weighing myself here 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:25.210
 but I did not have the right weapon once 

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:27.520
 that I will remember that it was not 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.060
 terrible but after I could exchange 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.689
 it was different I was really kidding and 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:36.789
 like you see if you do it or not 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:39.030
 here at benneteau on youtube in 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:39.030
