00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
into each end of the circuit so we'll

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.130 
into each end of the circuit so we'll
concentrate<00:00:59.489> on<00:00:59.850> turn<00:01:00.390> one<00:01:00.629> through<00:01:00.839> the<00:01:00.899> four

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.009 
concentrate on turn one through the four
and<00:01:01.410> then<00:01:01.769> turn<00:01:01.980> nine<00:01:02.250> through<00:01:02.550> 12<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.899> then

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
and then turn nine through 12 and then

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.749 
and then turn nine through 12 and then
basically<00:01:04.290> linking<00:01:04.799> those<00:01:04.920> corners<00:01:05.369> up<00:01:05.519> so

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
basically linking those corners up so

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:07.399 
basically linking those corners up so
all<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.090> technique<00:01:06.420> stuff<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.810> we<00:01:06.960> learnt

yesterday<00:01:07.860> putting<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.520> into<00:01:08.700> application

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
yesterday putting that into application

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:22.810 
yesterday putting that into application
on<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.659> on<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.200> track
