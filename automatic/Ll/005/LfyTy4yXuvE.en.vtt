00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
as you can see i'm pretty much running

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.340 
as you can see i'm pretty much running
now<00:02:11.490> if<00:02:11.700> i<00:02:11.850> go<00:02:11.880> ahead<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.480> run<00:02:12.780> back<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.110> where

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
now if i go ahead and run back to where

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.170 
now if i go ahead and run back to where
i<00:02:13.380> was<00:02:13.440> you<00:02:14.280> see<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:14.730> I'm

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
i was you see that I'm

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.690 
i was you see that I'm
like<00:02:15.269> sprinting<00:02:15.989> like<00:02:16.260> I'm<00:02:16.469> I'm<00:02:17.280> in<00:02:17.459> like<00:02:17.579> an

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
like sprinting like I'm I'm in like an

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.759 
like sprinting like I'm I'm in like an
all-out<00:02:17.819> sprint<00:02:18.209> spray<00:02:18.569> sweet<00:02:18.870> it's<00:02:19.409> probably

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
all-out sprint spray sweet it's probably

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.170 
all-out sprint spray sweet it's probably
like<00:02:19.920> double<00:02:20.340> your<00:02:20.459> normal<00:02:20.489> spring<00:02:21.030> I'm

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
like double your normal spring I'm

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.020 
like double your normal spring I'm
guessing<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.769> that's<00:02:22.769> pretty<00:02:23.010> cool<00:02:23.280> now<00:02:23.969> you

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
guessing and that's pretty cool now you

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.020 
guessing and that's pretty cool now you
can<00:02:24.209> also<00:02:24.510> double<00:02:25.379> jump<00:02:25.680> but<00:02:26.459> first<00:02:26.670> off<00:02:26.849> you

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
can also double jump but first off you

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.030 
can also double jump but first off you
jump<00:02:27.359> higher<00:02:28.260> than<00:02:28.409> you<00:02:28.500> normally<00:02:28.620> would<00:02:28.829> so

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
jump higher than you normally would so

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.759 
jump higher than you normally would so
if<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.310> jump<00:02:29.640> once<00:02:29.969> I'll<00:02:30.629> see<00:02:31.109> that<00:02:31.349> I<00:02:31.379> jump

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
if I jump once I'll see that I jump

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.250 
if I jump once I'll see that I jump
pretty<00:02:32.159> freaking<00:02:32.790> high<00:02:32.939> so<00:02:33.870> that's<00:02:33.989> pretty<00:02:34.170> I

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
pretty freaking high so that's pretty I

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.899 
pretty freaking high so that's pretty I
like<00:02:34.769> on<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.040> first<00:02:35.250> person<00:02:35.609> to<00:02:35.639> show<00:02:35.849> you

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
like on the first person to show you

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.479 
like on the first person to show you
that<00:02:36.090> that's<00:02:36.650> really<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.859> high<00:02:38.010> compared<00:02:38.430> to

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
that that's really a high compared to

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.030 
that that's really a high compared to
the<00:02:38.609> normal<00:02:39.060> jump<00:02:39.329> but<00:02:40.049> you<00:02:40.109> can<00:02:40.260> also<00:02:40.409> double

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
the normal jump but you can also double

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.039 
the normal jump but you can also double
jump<00:02:41.219> so<00:02:41.489> I'll<00:02:41.609> jump<00:02:41.879> in<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.090> air<00:02:42.120> I<00:02:42.420> can<00:02:42.900> jump

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
jump so I'll jump in the air I can jump

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.679 
jump so I'll jump in the air I can jump
again<00:02:43.319> and<00:02:43.560> that's<00:02:44.400> pretty<00:02:44.609> sweet<00:02:44.819> you<00:02:45.569> can

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:45.689 
again and that's pretty sweet you can

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:47.420 
again and that's pretty sweet you can
also<00:02:45.810> guess<00:02:46.260> that<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.769> don't<00:02:46.950> take<00:02:47.129> fall

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
also guess that you don't take fall

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.309 
also guess that you don't take fall
damage<00:02:47.549> because<00:02:48.150> all<00:02:48.299> you're<00:02:48.480> spider-man<00:02:48.810> and

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
damage because all you're spider-man and

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.110 
damage because all you're spider-man and
as<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.069> can<00:02:50.159> see<00:02:50.189> now<00:02:50.549> if<00:02:50.639> I<00:02:50.700> jump<00:02:50.909> pretty<00:02:51.030> high

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
as you can see now if I jump pretty high

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.539 
as you can see now if I jump pretty high
I'm<00:02:51.959> not<00:02:52.169> taking<00:02:52.530> any<00:02:52.680> fall<00:02:52.950> damage<00:02:53.340> and

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
I'm not taking any fall damage and

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.149 
I'm not taking any fall damage and
that's<00:02:54.030> pretty<00:02:54.239> sweet<00:02:54.530> now<00:02:55.530> of<00:02:55.620> course<00:02:55.709> you're

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
that's pretty sweet now of course you're

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:58.339 
that's pretty sweet now of course you're
spider-man<00:02:56.579> so<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.629> shouldn't<00:02:57.989> be<00:02:58.049> able<00:02:58.169> to

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
spider-man so you shouldn't be able to

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.819 
spider-man so you shouldn't be able to
climb<00:02:58.530> walls<00:02:58.769> and<00:02:59.159> that<00:02:59.400> you<00:02:59.609> can<00:02:59.639> do<00:03:00.650> so<00:03:01.650> if<00:03:01.739> I

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
climb walls and that you can do so if I

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.369 
climb walls and that you can do so if I
climb<00:03:02.040> this<00:03:02.340> one<00:03:02.639> faced<00:03:02.909> house<00:03:03.180> go<00:03:03.840> see<00:03:04.079> that<00:03:04.230> I
