 fernando arms forward fernando very 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.720

 How cute does it transport us? 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:54.259
 to our lands the choir liked the 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:57.189
 chorus is very well I think that now you 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:05:00.469
 I can appreciate in the voice in the voice of 

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:01.909
 lead singer and I think with all 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:03.830
 the respect it deserves not all 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:06.439

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.990
 to think is more motors to is a little more 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:10.189
 more serious you put feelings and for 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.710
 there is the voice and now also but 

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:14.120
 I think he could this one could practice 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.909
 a little more so that you have one more voice 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:20.719

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:22.000
 retamar and carmen your opinion please me 

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:25.000
 he liked it much more than the first 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 presentation 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.800
 that what we want you to convey that 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.270
 have fun to have it look 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.790
 that you are also having a good time 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.790
 because they are going to infect the public 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.910
 really as fernando says also the 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.410
 choirs have been very well there has been 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.660
 much sweetness in the way of singing in 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.810
 the choirs in the main voice also 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.160
 we have been on the right track 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:52.680
 work more in the nuances that is 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.780
 these voices so melancholy as of 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:58.169
 regret but strong at the same time but with 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.729
 sweetness with feeling you're out there 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:02.490
 I'm on the road, you have to work it 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:04.979
 better but in general as a group like 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.550
 team have been much better than the 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:10.229
 first time happiness thank you very much 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.410
 maricarmen marín now we hear the 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:14.639
 opinion of Mr. Ricardo Morán 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.470
 definitely this presentation is 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:19.340
 better than your previous presentation there 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.340
 a progress there 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:25.330
 there's been more energy on stage 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:28.900
 that was what we asked for I feel 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:31.629
 we need a lot more more party more 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.249
 joy now because that energy does not 

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:35.860
 disorder in the first half of the 

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:38.139
 I have felt disorganized 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.300
 messed up in the times there between the 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:42.120
 first and the second voice moved a 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.979
 little bit and the harmony did not fit well 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:47.469
 be careful there the second voice state 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:50.199
 impeccable congratulate her first voice 

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:52.839
 still a little bit more acute 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:54.969
 to be better to measure it seems to me that 

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:57.129
 is to open a small detune there 

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:58.419
 but nothing serious that I need to adjust 

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:00.189
 I feel that the energy was not better 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:02.319
 but I want a party I want there to be 

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:03.889
 more party with the carcas so that 

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:06.770
 look more 

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:09.340
 if this Japanese let's go then and 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.340
 came back
