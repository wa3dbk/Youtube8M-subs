00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:29.660 

okay<00:00:00.840> so<00:00:01.199> this<00:00:01.410> is<00:00:01.680> intake<00:00:28.220> now<00:00:29.220> under<00:00:29.519> the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
okay so this is intake now under the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.130 
okay so this is intake now under the
mechanics<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.320> intake<00:00:31.820> so<00:00:32.899> the<00:00:33.899> way<00:00:34.020> it

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
mechanics of the intake so the way it

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.090 
mechanics of the intake so the way it
works<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:35.280> have<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:35.940> base<00:00:36.270> plate<00:00:36.750> and

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
works is you have this base plate and

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.360 
works is you have this base plate and
that<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.399> hooked<00:00:38.700> up<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.210> center<00:00:39.629> piece

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
that is hooked up to the center piece

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.590 
that is hooked up to the center piece
that<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.750> holding<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.350> rack<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.920> then

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
that is holding the rack and then

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.260 
that is holding the rack and then
mounted<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.079> actual<00:00:46.860> ball<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.820> have<00:00:47.940> this

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
mounted to the actual ball you have this

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.990 
mounted to the actual ball you have this
the<00:00:49.020> gear<00:00:49.320> which<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:49.829> considered<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.610> second

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
the gear which is considered the second

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.209 
the gear which is considered the second
arm<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.420> then<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.379> have<00:00:52.500> your<00:00:52.649> first<00:00:52.920> arm

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
arm and then you have your first arm

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.520 
arm and then you have your first arm
which<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:53.910> mechanism<00:00:54.210> this<00:00:55.110> has<00:00:55.500> a

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
which is this mechanism this has a

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.430 
which is this mechanism this has a
stopper<00:00:56.370> right<00:00:56.969> here<00:00:57.270> inside<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.930> gear<00:00:58.230> and

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
stopper right here inside the gear and

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.049 
stopper right here inside the gear and
so<00:00:59.160> that's<00:00:59.760> going<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.620> be<00:01:01.620> able<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.859> flip<00:01:02.129> up<00:01:02.340> on

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
so that's going to be able to flip up on

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.780 
so that's going to be able to flip up on
both<00:01:03.629> sides<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.920> when<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.189> have<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.369> cube

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
both sides and so when you have a cube

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.390 
both sides and so when you have a cube
that's<00:01:06.360> gonna<00:01:06.630> go<00:01:06.869> through<00:01:06.920> flip<00:01:07.920> those<00:01:08.159> up

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
that's gonna go through flip those up

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.340 
that's gonna go through flip those up
and<00:01:08.670> then<00:01:08.729> they're<00:01:09.030> gonna<00:01:09.270> get<00:01:09.540> stopped<00:01:09.990> there

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
and then they're gonna get stopped there

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.880 
and then they're gonna get stopped there
and<00:01:10.650> then<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:12.150> way<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:13.020> ejects<00:01:13.680> the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
and then the way that it ejects the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.100 
and then the way that it ejects the
cubes<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.490> when<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.090> push<00:01:15.330> down<00:01:15.540> on<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:15.869> base

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
cubes is when you push down on this base

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.160 
cubes is when you push down on this base
plate<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.920> drives<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.460> rack<00:01:17.729> piece<00:01:18.540> on<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
plate it drives the rack piece on the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.859 
plate it drives the rack piece on the
gear<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:20.310> gear<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.729> acting<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.420> another

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
gear and the gear is acting is another

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.499 
gear and the gear is acting is another
arm<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:23.430> that's<00:01:23.610> going<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.060> push<00:01:24.270> these

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
arm and so that's going to push these

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.080 
arm and so that's going to push these
arms<00:01:24.900> down<00:01:25.110> until<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.009> have<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.189> fare<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.670> so

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
arms down until you have a fare and so

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.359 
arms down until you have a fare and so
you<00:01:27.450> have<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.600> fair<00:01:27.810> amount<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:28.369> rubberband

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
you have a fair amount of rubberband

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.789 
you have a fair amount of rubberband
force<00:01:29.880> here<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.450> one's<00:01:30.659> actually<00:01:30.869> smooth<00:01:31.380> so

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
force here this one's actually smooth so

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.039 
force here this one's actually smooth so
not<00:01:32.430> as<00:01:32.549> much<00:01:32.729> as<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.060> would<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.509> normal<00:01:33.689> form

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
not as much as it would in a normal form

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.070 
not as much as it would in a normal form
that<00:01:37.049> allows<00:01:37.520> for<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:39.000> push<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.360> down<00:01:39.510> and

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
that allows for this to push it down and

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.620 
that allows for this to push it down and
it's<00:01:40.440> it's<00:01:40.770> gonna<00:01:40.890> be<00:01:41.100> hard<00:01:41.369> for<00:01:41.670> other<00:01:42.150> robots

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
it's it's gonna be hard for other robots

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.240 
it's it's gonna be hard for other robots
to<00:01:42.810> push<00:01:42.990> on<00:01:43.200> this<00:01:43.350> because<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:43.710> will<00:01:44.010> be

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
to push on this because this will be

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.380 
to push on this because this will be
inside<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:45.380> a<00:01:46.380> queue<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.800> so<00:01:47.670> for<00:01:48.270> other

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
inside of a queue and so for other

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.940 
inside of a queue and so for other
robots<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.930> push<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.440> plate<00:01:49.710> it's<00:01:49.890> going

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
robots to push on that plate it's going

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.340 
robots to push on that plate it's going
to<00:01:50.130> be<00:01:50.250> extremely<00:01:51.000> difficult<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:51.990> other

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
to be extremely difficult so other

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.960 
to be extremely difficult so other
robots<00:01:52.740> aren't<00:01:52.950> gonna<00:01:53.100> be<00:01:53.250> able<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.490> objector

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
robots aren't gonna be able to objector

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.580 
robots aren't gonna be able to objector
cubes<00:01:54.360> but<00:01:56.240> yeah<00:01:57.240> that's<00:01:57.420> that's<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.170> basic

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
cubes but yeah that's that's the basic

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.710 
cubes but yeah that's that's the basic
design<00:01:59.220> of<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.580> intake<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:01.490> is<00:02:02.720> getting

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
design of the intake and so is getting

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:10.180 
design of the intake and so is getting
enough<00:02:03.990> capacity<00:02:05.210> just<00:02:08.479> want<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.539> demonstrate

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
enough capacity just want to demonstrate

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.810 
enough capacity just want to demonstrate
how<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.420> flip<00:02:12.420> mechanism<00:02:13.670> increases<00:02:14.670> your

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
how the flip mechanism increases your

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.870 
how the flip mechanism increases your
capacity<00:02:18.500> this<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.560> a<00:02:19.739> five<00:02:20.220> this<00:02:20.519> is<00:02:20.580> only

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
capacity this is a five this is only

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:36.630 
capacity this is a five this is only
four

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.430 

the<00:02:37.640> progress<00:02:38.120> that<00:02:38.330> this<00:02:38.480> intake<00:02:38.870> is<00:02:38.900> making

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
the progress that this intake is making

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.729 
the progress that this intake is making
and<00:02:40.780> hopefully<00:02:41.780> a<00:02:41.810> little<00:02:42.110> more<00:02:42.260> detailed

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
and hopefully a little more detailed

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.069 
and hopefully a little more detailed
video
