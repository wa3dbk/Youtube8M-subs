00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.669
 how about everyone that everyone in this video 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:10.580
 I'm going to talk about modifications and here 

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:13.070
 we have a modification of this already 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.680
 I had talked I liked it a lot and for 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.439
 that deserves the reward of going back to 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.610
 come out in other videos today let's talk 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:24.439
 of the mirror cube 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:27.390
 they will throw this is a dining room 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:30.030
 then and I do not know what will have happened there 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.450
 but that is good 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.810
 here we have a layer is the layer more 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.540
 thin the mirror cube 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:43.370
 and we can throw it the senate what is this 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.380
 of modifications is what kind of 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:51.280
 modifications is therefore I say that 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:51.280
 these corners here 1 2 and 3 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:59.979
 to see 1 2 3 and 4 corners were not 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.390
 that there were only four corners 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:05.820
 1 2 3 and 4 and already 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.130
 what I did was he had to sand 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.159
 Well first I took a hacksaw because in 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.990
 that time I did not have a special machine 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.150
 which is like a machine that has a 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.990
 little head that you choose and what you do is 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:22.430
 remove like that in that way had a one 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.660
 I made some steps 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.730
 I took a sheet I made some measurements of the cube 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.840
 after I made this form I drew it in 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:34.020
 all faces 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.590
 and in the end I started cutting it 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.359
 with the blade thus guiding me by the 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.720
 lines that I had done that I had 

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:44.750
 drawn with a cutter 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.660
 I did it like that and I removed it and already and in the end 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.790
 everything was totally hollow after him 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:56.130
 Apply epoxy resin 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:58.570
 obviously the mass was gray then 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:03.490
 I picked up a marker 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:08.950
 a little coarse I took a marker and what 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:11.170
 I painted black then I put paper 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.470
 of that kind of paper 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.900
 this kind of yellow paper with what 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.510
 the yellow on all the faces here 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.319
 yellow here yellow and yellow here 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.800
 yellow 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:26.200
 Pretty pretty mejÃ­a I liked quite 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.170
 that is, it was great 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:33.160
 but the truth is not me, I did not 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:36.310
 liking as well as a lot because of something 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.800
 I said good is nice but good what 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.590
 solved the way to solve is a little 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.959
 strange you have to keep in mind that the 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.640
 that this cube is a 3 x 3 but 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.090
 modified by that is called the cube 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.240
 mirror 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.400
 We can observe 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.400
 some lines that I had made 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:01.660
 and that was for the stickers because I 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.140
 I made stickers stickers that is first 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.180
 bringing the paper 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:12.770
 and I was doing these measures 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:16.430
 if these measures for this kind of this 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.850
 it was very difficult it was very difficult to do 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.780
 a sticker of these of this style 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:26.190
 But I did it 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.360
 and then I liked it a lot and I think that 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.730
 the video is getting a bit 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.160
 boring so you have to talk talk 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:36.840
 talk so I put all the 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:39.050
 stickers and then I took and on paper as 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.960
 It is called 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:45.080
 he picked up a transparent paper 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:48.080
 especially to stick the tape what 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:51.430
 place at 102 on all faces to 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:55.540
 that you do not see him so he will not take off 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:58.719
 then how it seemed to the tape is like 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.450
 of conscience and then I had it for a 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:03.459
 time like this then I removed it afterwards 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.439
 I said no no, I already want it totally 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.959
 black then I started to remove all the 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:10.540
 all the stickers was very easy 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:14.409
 make him remove it with his fingernail towards this and 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:17.620
 it came out and it was black and after a 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:20.410
 time after a few weeks 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.500
 this game started to experience a 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:26.169
 discoloration and that was how I had 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.250
 painted with marker this had been 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:34.150
 with a purple then I took a ribbon 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:38.199
 black tape masking tape and what 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:42.300
 I did was make measurements and paste it like this 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:42.300
 this mode and it stayed this way 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.280
 a little weird 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.120
 is this layer if I liked it because if the 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:54.410
 I did more or less well 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:05:00.139
 and we are going to undo the undo 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:04.689
 the cube and no more cons here I know 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:08.090
 to see that he had made a permutation already 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:10.430
 and be 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:13.100
 I always take this cube as an example 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:17.419
 I know why I did this but reflected in 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:20.300
 this seems like I think not then 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:24.270
 so we have and we will return to the 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:27.540
 normal way and so it would be 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.580
 let's do it let's talk about the turn 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:32.990
 the turn up is pretty good that's 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.990
 I think the only thing that saves him 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:45.910
 it turns pretty well pretty well we're going to 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.910
 undo it like this 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.910
 and some pieces that dance 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.910
 They can even be removed 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:00.320
 maybe that's why it turns that turn 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:02.510
 also good that way it is done here 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.340
 we can see how public it was and everything 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.190
 the rest 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:09.580
 I hope you liked the video 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:11.930
 I hope you liked me 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:16.690
 modification to me the truth I liked 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:18.889
 but then I did not like anything after 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.650
 also in the way of solving it there 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:24.380
 to see this this center there is 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:27.530
 ask it well I hope you have 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:30.729
 liked this video and see you until the 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.729
 next see you later
