00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:11.269
 hi boys and girls finally 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:16.219
 I finally gathered this miracle beast 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.219
 knife sharpening equipment 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:24.680
 I saw plenty of videos about these 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:28.140
 Chinese apex and shmap x and so on and 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:34.140
 I thought that you do not collect yourself the same 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:37.440
 sharpener because I love the vaccine 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:43.559
 I love and that my wonderful knives were 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:46.559
 well of course I had to 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:52.260
 to suffer but in fact not so everything 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:57.440
 it was hard not to use any there 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:00.359
 drawings death hedgehogs looked 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:06.380
 understood a little bit refined by 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:11.600
 at least here it is a ball system 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:14.580
 very much and got a similar I do not need 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.210
 learn too much and very well with her 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.810
 convenient to work because the principle 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.220
 hinge 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:28.470
 children so she and up and down everything clearly 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:33.940
 krasivenko all in and so we 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:38.410
 working here means 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:41.890
 I want to share one thing like me 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.000
 did this hinge mechanism here it is 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.710
 there is 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:52.210
 profile tube I do not remember the size I 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:55.500
 probably it is 40 by 60 most likely here 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.120
 this is the ball that is used 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:03.490
 door stoppers limiter such 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:06.550
 rubber is driven into the floor of the door something 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.550
 I fought the bank or the wall in him and his 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:14.380
 drilled do to the floor plastic 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:18.910
 rubber floor in profile pipe 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:23.770
 made two holes above and below the ball 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:27.820
 well here manti wish to set up this foundation 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:33.310
 took the usual plate to us with some 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:38.550
 electric bills made from PCB 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:41.200
 okay a lot of holes came here 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.660
 here are the holes when i put 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:49.530
 screw this plate that holds 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:53.500
 knife on like that basically tricky simple 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.940
 one more joke which I did here 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.540
 so for now just ordinary building 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:03.430
 sandpaper this example on the buttons yet 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.290
 will continue to think how to do it and 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.690
 secure to be convenient for 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:12.310
 knives why I did want to explain 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:17.560
 washed down on a semicircular system here she 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:21.360
 it is not necessary here for this knife is for 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:26.260
 this knife or such knives because 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:28.160
 everybody understands that this straight knife is yes 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:33.620
 i will sharpen 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:36.520
 this is me more often such a scrutiny 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:42.170
 knife i'm the direct part never task 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:44.960
 when my example will lie to me 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.020
 it will be necessary here it is a semicircular part 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.550
 it's overlaid 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:54.500
 sandpaper and I will work here 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:58.940
 this part on the semicircular because u 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.760
 me here here here goes straight for a month 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:05.960
 part of it but 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:09.650
 but so basically what else ordinary 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:11.500
 the welded nut here is the usual bolt 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:18.650
 lever him 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:19.840
 so that I can raise the height more angle 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.100
 above 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:26.110
 spun here it turns out carving 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:31.210
 rested against the wall but such a sharpener 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:36.440
 simple pretty good this knife 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:40.990
 I didnâ€™t see the hair 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:43.880
 see here lenses we work fine 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.580
 vaccinations are already superior before. 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:50.210
 couldn't conclude here 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:57.410
 because the hand is out of hand and you have an eye 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:05:02.390
 here I set 18 degrees now 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:04.540
 they will cure a kitchen knife thanks that 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:09.080
 dare nothing complicated 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:14.620
 once again about the device, this is our 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:20.960
 forward that this one goes 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:24.639
 system all mount for regulation 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:31.360
 sharpening angle 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:34.110
 here from a regular strip snapped to nothing 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:38.939
 so that it does not interfere with sharpening two holes 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:43.919
 such a clamp there nuts down 

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:50.560
 here such screws we will test the whole knife 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:51.969
 calmly put himself under the grinding here 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.699
 this is the hinge system 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:59.830
 I think she is very interesting very 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:06:03.370
 convenient and flip easily and I find 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:05.289
 that the most perfect thing when there was but 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:10.000
 invented in this situation because 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:12.759
 everything else does not give such an evenness 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.610
 clarity in how this system works 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:20.009
 the angle here does not change at all 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:23.009
 work is in one place for yourself while 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:23.009
 Keep
