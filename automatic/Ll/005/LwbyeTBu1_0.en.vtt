outside like your zealot but you can't

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.410 
outside like your zealot but you can't
just<00:01:55.860> keep<00:01:56.009> upgrading<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.880> adding<00:01:57.240> more

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
just keep upgrading and adding more

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.300 
just keep upgrading and adding more
units<00:01:57.810> into<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:58.680> as<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.860> can<00:01:58.950> see<00:01:59.009> we're

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
units into it so as you can see we're

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.649 
units into it so as you can see we're
trying<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.549> kill<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.880> transporter<00:02:00.479> right

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
trying to kill that transporter right

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.300 
trying to kill that transporter right
there<00:02:00.869> we<00:02:01.229> just<00:02:01.439> did<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.710> nidus<00:02:01.979> firm<00:02:02.159> that

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
there we just did the nidus firm that

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.730 
there we just did the nidus firm that
kept<00:02:02.520> transporting<00:02:03.180> zerglings<00:02:03.990> up<00:02:04.290> into<00:02:04.619> our

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
kept transporting zerglings up into our

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.330 
kept transporting zerglings up into our
base<00:02:04.920> our<00:02:05.189> up<00:02:05.340> into<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.729> map

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
base our up into the map

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.889 
base our up into the map
so<00:02:06.490> that's<00:02:06.729> pretty<00:02:06.880> much<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:07.240> objective

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
so that's pretty much the objective

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.499 
so that's pretty much the objective
right<00:02:08.020> now<00:02:08.080> is<00:02:08.500> to<00:02:08.739> make<00:02:08.860> sure<00:02:09.130> we<00:02:09.429> stop<00:02:09.729> all

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
right now is to make sure we stop all

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.240 
right now is to make sure we stop all
transporters<00:02:11.380> like<00:02:11.470> here<00:02:11.650> popped<00:02:11.860> up<00:02:12.010> another

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
transporters like here popped up another

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.979 
transporters like here popped up another
one<00:02:12.430> that<00:02:12.790> are<00:02:13.090> transporting<00:02:13.540> use<00:02:13.660> in<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.870> mat

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
one that are transporting use in the mat

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.740 
one that are transporting use in the mat
because<00:02:14.170> so<00:02:15.010> many<00:02:15.180> transporters<00:02:16.180> will<00:02:16.330> pop<00:02:16.510> up

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
because so many transporters will pop up

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.360 
because so many transporters will pop up
and<00:02:17.020> then<00:02:17.170> you<00:02:17.290> just<00:02:17.319> start<00:02:17.680> getting<00:02:17.739> screwed

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
and then you just start getting screwed

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.420 
and then you just start getting screwed
because<00:02:18.640> you<00:02:19.000> can't<00:02:19.599> really<00:02:19.870> you<00:02:20.440> know<00:02:20.530> fight

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
because you can't really you know fight

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.770 
because you can't really you know fight
off<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.819> units<00:02:22.060> that<00:02:22.090> are<00:02:22.180> coming<00:02:22.480> out<00:02:22.599> and

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
off the units that are coming out and

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.360 
off the units that are coming out and
then<00:02:22.959> kill<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.319> transporters<00:02:23.920> if<00:02:24.160> there's

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
then kill the transporters if there's

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.120 
then kill the transporters if there's
several<00:02:24.700> and<00:02:25.630> here's<00:02:26.110> a<00:02:26.200> few<00:02:26.349> have<00:02:26.590> a<00:02:26.830> few

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
several and here's a few have a few

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.830 
several and here's a few have a few
items<00:02:27.250> that<00:02:27.580> I'd<00:02:28.239> like<00:02:28.420> to<00:02:28.450> show<00:02:28.660> to<00:02:28.690> you

items that I'd like to show to you
there's<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:30.599> LED<00:02:31.599> linearity<00:02:32.319> boost<00:02:32.620> it

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
there's the LED linearity boost it

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.729 
there's the LED linearity boost it
boosts<00:02:33.459> the<00:02:33.760> zealots<00:02:34.209> movement<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:34.870> you<00:02:35.560> can

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
boosts the zealots movement and you can

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.880 
boosts the zealots movement and you can
sell<00:02:35.950> it<00:02:36.069> at<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.459> crash<00:02:36.730> ship<00:02:37.019> now<00:02:38.019> there's

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
sell it at the crash ship now there's

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.229 
sell it at the crash ship now there's
several<00:02:39.040> different<00:02:39.190> there's<00:02:39.880> several

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
several different there's several

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.930 
several different there's several
different<00:02:40.390> items<00:02:40.870> maybe<00:02:41.260> not<00:02:41.440> you<00:02:41.920> know<00:02:42.040> one

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
different items maybe not you know one

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.180 
different items maybe not you know one
that<00:02:43.120> compares<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.600> dota<00:02:43.840> as<00:02:44.290> an<00:02:44.650> item<00:02:44.890> system

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
that compares to dota as an item system

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.280 
that compares to dota as an item system
but<00:02:45.910> there's<00:02:46.090> there<00:02:46.299> certainly<00:02:46.660> a<00:02:46.750> lot<00:02:46.959> you

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
but there's there certainly a lot you

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.770 
but there's there certainly a lot you
can<00:02:47.530> get<00:02:48.430> little<00:02:48.640> health<00:02:49.030> packs<00:02:49.299> that<00:02:49.630> are

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
can get little health packs that are

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.890 
can get little health packs that are
called<00:02:49.959> life<00:02:50.200> stems<00:02:50.560> you<00:02:51.400> can<00:02:51.640> get<00:02:51.910> an<00:02:52.450> attack

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
called life stems you can get an attack

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.990 
called life stems you can get an attack
damage<00:02:53.140> right<00:02:54.069> here<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.430> charged<00:02:54.730> side

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
damage right here the charged side

you pick up these right that was a live

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.130 
you pick up these right that was a live
stem<00:03:03.280> right<00:03:03.400> there<00:03:03.610> that<00:03:03.760> uh<00:03:03.790> that<00:03:04.720> heals<00:03:05.019> you

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
stem right there that uh that heals you

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.370 
stem right there that uh that heals you
200<00:03:05.709> points<00:03:06.310> for<00:03:06.370> use<00:03:06.700> and<00:03:07.569> so<00:03:07.810> what<00:03:08.049> right<00:03:08.260> now

we're doing fantastic see the little
there's<00:03:10.329> actually<00:03:10.660> a<00:03:10.720> little<00:03:10.870> depression<00:03:11.769> in

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
there's actually a little depression in

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.130 
there's actually a little depression in
the<00:03:12.489> ground<00:03:12.519> where<00:03:12.970> that<00:03:13.150> came<00:03:13.359> up<00:03:13.540> wherever

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
the ground where that came up wherever

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.870 
the ground where that came up wherever
the<00:03:14.260> NIDA<00:03:14.920> storm<00:03:15.220> came<00:03:15.400> up<00:03:15.489> so<00:03:15.609> that's<00:03:15.700> a

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
the NIDA storm came up so that's a

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.270 
the NIDA storm came up so that's a
fantastic<00:03:16.269> use<00:03:16.660> of<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:17.019> of<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.709> editor<00:03:18.010> to

add in some nice little details as you
can<00:03:20.890> see<00:03:21.040> the<00:03:21.269> different<00:03:22.269> units<00:03:22.630> start<00:03:22.810> coming

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
can see the different units start coming

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.440 
can see the different units start coming
after<00:03:23.470> each<00:03:23.620> you<00:03:24.160> know<00:03:24.280> after<00:03:24.670> each<00:03:24.790> way<00:03:25.030> that

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
after each you know after each way that

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.360 
after each you know after each way that
the<00:03:25.750> transporter<00:03:26.410> war<00:03:26.739> prism<00:03:27.130> you<00:03:27.250> know

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370

whatever nydus worms rings them up

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.759 
whatever nydus worms rings them up
brings<00:03:29.739> in<00:03:29.890> a<00:03:29.980> different<00:03:30.340> unit<00:03:30.609> with<00:03:31.650> you<00:03:32.650> know

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
brings in a different unit with you know

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.520 
brings in a different unit with you know
better<00:03:32.950> abilities<00:03:33.430> or<00:03:33.670> better<00:03:34.049> life<00:03:35.049> better

better abilities or better life better

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.400 
better abilities or better life better
attack<00:03:36.100> you<00:03:36.880> know<00:03:36.970> just<00:03:37.269> increasingly<00:03:38.200> more

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
attack you know just increasingly more

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.140 
attack you know just increasingly more
difficult<00:03:38.470> I<00:03:39.010> now<00:03:39.220> think<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.549> game<00:03:39.730> is<00:03:39.760> on

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
difficult I now think the game is on

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.319 
difficult I now think the game is on
very<00:03:40.480> easy<00:03:40.900> so<00:03:41.380> hopefully<00:03:42.190> we'll<00:03:42.970> be<00:03:43.090> able<00:03:43.120> to

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
very easy so hopefully we'll be able to

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.930 
very easy so hopefully we'll be able to
beat<00:03:43.540> it<00:03:43.569> I<00:03:44.040> have<00:03:45.040> been<00:03:45.190> this<00:03:45.310> game<00:03:45.459> once<00:03:45.730> I

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
beat it I have been this game once I

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.390 
beat it I have been this game once I
have<00:03:46.120> died<00:03:46.389> a<00:03:46.780> ton<00:03:47.200> though<00:03:47.620> I<00:03:47.889> have<00:03:48.100> to<00:03:48.220> hide

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
have died a ton though I have to hide

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.030 
have died a ton though I have to hide
eight<00:03:48.579> on<00:03:48.819> so<00:03:49.239> we'll<00:03:50.139> see<00:03:50.350> we'll<00:03:50.650> see<00:03:50.680> how<00:03:50.920> it

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
eight on so we'll see we'll see how it

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.650 
eight on so we'll see we'll see how it
goes<00:03:51.069> I'm<00:03:52.030> gonna<00:03:52.180> go<00:03:52.269> ahead<00:03:52.359> and<00:03:52.480> build

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
goes I'm gonna go ahead and build

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.800 
goes I'm gonna go ahead and build
another<00:03:52.930> bunker<00:03:53.170> over<00:03:53.560> here<00:03:54.690> because<00:03:55.690> I<00:03:55.780> have

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
another bunker over here because I have

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.240 
another bunker over here because I have
so<00:03:56.079> I<00:03:56.109> have<00:03:56.290> five<00:03:56.530> hundred<00:03:56.709> and<00:03:56.920> something<00:03:57.160> in

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
so I have five hundred and something in

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.620 
so I have five hundred and something in
a<00:03:57.280> real<00:03:57.459> stuff<00:03:57.700> I'm<00:03:58.359> not<00:03:58.920> not<00:04:00.120> you<00:04:01.120> know<00:04:01.209> low<00:04:01.480> on

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
a real stuff I'm not not you know low on

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:02.849 
a real stuff I'm not not you know low on
minerals<00:04:01.959> at<00:04:02.079> all<00:04:02.200> and<00:04:02.380> here<00:04:02.500> come<00:04:02.620> board

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
minerals at all and here come board

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:06.880 
minerals at all and here come board
raise<00:04:03.040> these<00:04:04.109> so<00:04:05.109> bad

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
raise these so bad

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.960 
raise these so bad
hopefully<00:04:07.890> the<00:04:08.130> Marines<00:04:08.430> in<00:04:08.520> the<00:04:08.610> bunk<00:04:08.790> will

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
hopefully the Marines in the bunk will

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
hopefully the Marines in the bunk will
be<00:04:09.090> able<00:04:09.180> to<00:04:09.300> take<00:04:09.420> him<00:04:09.540> down<00:04:09.690> because<00:04:09.780> we

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
be able to take him down because we

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.520 
be able to take him down because we
cannot<00:04:10.320> attack<00:04:10.710> air<00:04:10.950> at<00:04:11.130> all<00:04:11.310> not<00:04:12.210> at<00:04:12.540> all<00:04:12.570> so

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
cannot attack air at all not at all so

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.680 
cannot attack air at all not at all so
we're<00:04:14.520> going<00:04:14.610> to<00:04:14.730> rely<00:04:14.970> on<00:04:15.000> the<00:04:15.180> bunkers<00:04:15.540> to

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
we're going to rely on the bunkers to

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.000 
we're going to rely on the bunkers to
take<00:04:15.870> them<00:04:16.020> out<00:04:16.170> and<00:04:16.350> I<00:04:16.440> just<00:04:16.620> lost<00:04:16.739> my

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
take them out and I just lost my

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.220 
take them out and I just lost my
humungous<00:04:17.610> bunker<00:04:18.060> I<00:04:18.270> don't<00:04:18.720> there's<00:04:18.959> my<00:04:19.110> eyes

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
humungous bunker I don't there's my eyes

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.660 
humungous bunker I don't there's my eyes
Ella<00:04:19.500> I<00:04:19.709> couldn't<00:04:19.920> even<00:04:20.040> find<00:04:20.220> them<00:04:20.400> for<00:04:20.610> a

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
Ella I couldn't even find them for a

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.670 
Ella I couldn't even find them for a
second<00:04:21.000> but<00:04:21.660> every<00:04:21.870> time<00:04:22.020> you<00:04:22.080> level<00:04:22.290> up<00:04:22.500> as

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
second but every time you level up as

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.950 
second but every time you level up as
your<00:04:22.860> survivor<00:04:23.220> you<00:04:23.940> get<00:04:24.150> your<00:04:24.630> health

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
I picked up a photon cannon from that

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.970 
I picked up a photon cannon from that
guy<00:04:46.890> but<00:04:47.730> I<00:04:48.030> mean<00:04:48.240> this<00:04:48.510> is<00:04:48.690> not<00:04:48.930> good<00:04:49.410> at<00:04:49.740> all

with<00:05:06.240> that<00:05:06.360> photon<00:05:06.780> cannon<00:05:07.020> upgrade<00:05:07.440> that<00:05:07.830> I

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
with that photon cannon upgrade that I

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.430 
with that photon cannon upgrade that I
picked<00:05:08.160> off<00:05:08.310> of<00:05:08.520> that<00:05:08.610> dead<00:05:08.790> guy<00:05:09.260> so<00:05:10.260> that's

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
picked off of that dead guy so that's

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.189 
picked off of that dead guy so that's
kind<00:05:10.680> of<00:05:10.740> nice
