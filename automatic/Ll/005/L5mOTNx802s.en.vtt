00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.240
 hello good morning good afternoon good 

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:08.970
 nights I am pink and I will be had 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.820
 history of how to configure windows 7 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.730
 in the section of sounds to be able 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.669
 make a video in which the 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.859
 image and the own video sound and to the 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:23.509
 time to add your voice through the 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.730
 microphone is worth 300 seconds problems 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:29.429
 wind I put the voice with the microphone or 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.619
 well the sound of the video but not both 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.289
 at the same time what is the main problem 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.660
 that we have, we may not have 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:39.629
 the installed drivers then you will have to 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.230
 install the drivers as I know if the 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.500
 I have a simple indicator or not 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.629
 is to go to the bottom right of the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.910
 screen where the speaker is next 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.219
 of the clock and the date right button on 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.620
 the speaker we give devices to 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.829
 such a window will now 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.519
 what is it like if we do not have this icon 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.199
 stereo mix we probably do not have the 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:06.840
 installed drivers 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.289
 it will be necessary to install the drivers as 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.190
 where we all simple encounters 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:15.860
 to google 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:19.340
 we mark real tech 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.400
 the first option we enter the page 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.200
 from realtech and let's try 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.040
 download the audio drivers that 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.010
 we have them here hd audio codec brings 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.570
 driver 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.220
 we chop 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.580
 but upload the download page 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.590
 you once we download the driver 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:43.910
 It's about 50 megabytes 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.910
 we will have to restart the computer 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.440
 once rebooted from the computer 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:56.440
 we will appear stereo mix this is what 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.340
 you're going to miss this is the main thing is 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.340
 a little slow 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.350
 the good connection this is what is going 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.610
 to miss and it 's really what mick is 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:09.479
 the sound of the microphone and the audio and 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.489
 the pc's own audio 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.140
 we are talking about windows 7 here 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.530
 you have other operating systems but 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.500
 we go the 32 bits 64 bits according to your 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:23.519
 operating system we have several sites 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.170
 to download the choose any 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.989
 some that go faster than other 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.680
 tester are discharged equal 50 megabytes 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.720
 of download installs restart and 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.910
 this will automatically appear 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.920
 As this does not matter when we which 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.349
 let's say it's the same 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.290
 they are going to record the same, you just have to 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:46.280
 make two steps plus one is the 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.560
 reproduction 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.830
 in speaker that where we are 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.410
 playing the sound there is currently 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.810
 that go to properties levels we 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.599
 we will find the microphone to the minimum is 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.150
 This is one of the reasons why 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.310
 listen and is the main one once you 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.790
 you showed a little bit with the 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.010
 program that we use to record this 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.330
 the main problem is the microphone 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.040
 we have the minimum is to give the maximum 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.010
 we accept and for this part we have already 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.650
 finished now there will be more to put the 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.739
 option of exterior mix in the program 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.019
 that we are using to record in this 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.990
 case you sing I'm already using cantas 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.240
 already 6 I've done a couple of screenshots 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:36.819
 since during the recording it is not 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.790
 can you hear forgiveness you can not see him 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:42.519
 the tools section is valid but once 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.889
 that we press in tools we will go out 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:47.709
 a window like this one here we'll go to 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:50.549
 audio you will get this option the car 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:54.909
 device on audio device sorry to choose 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:56.799
 stereo mix is â€‹â€‹worth stereo mix what's below 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:59.109
 it does not matter if you put it manual or it is not 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:02.260
 it is important to stop an input 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:05.650
 level you put it on top and you give it to ok 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.000
 with this is configured qantas already 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.280
 so listen 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.030
 and the sound of 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.489
 of the microphone and so you know that 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.130
 listen to the sound of the stereo mix and 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:22.870
 we have configured the stereo mix to 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.870
 I heard speaker and microphone 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.610
 and especially the speaker that you hear 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.819
 the microphone 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:33.189
 on the speaker so now the program 

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:36.430
 you have to record, come on, I've done it 

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:38.500
 done I have been previous hours 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.819
 looking for solution at the end found in 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.710
 followed in this video I hope that you 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:48.129
 have liked and serve you without more kids 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.960
 I say goodbye I hope you have served this 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:53.039
 small video and I hope your 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.039
 comments until then
