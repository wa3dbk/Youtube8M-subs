00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.590 
now the best part about coming to these
projects<00:02:45.840> is<00:02:46.110> that<00:02:46.860> they<00:02:47.010> are<00:02:47.220> single<00:02:47.910> so<00:02:48.390> that

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
projects is that they are single so that

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.560 
projects is that they are single so that
you<00:02:48.810> only<00:02:49.050> have<00:02:49.290> one<00:02:49.650> dog<00:02:49.950> or<00:02:50.340> one<00:02:50.820> flora<00:02:51.120> giant

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
you only have one dog or one flora giant

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.810 
you only have one dog or one flora giant
on<00:02:51.690> you<00:02:51.900> at<00:02:52.020> a<00:02:52.050> time<00:02:52.350> so<00:02:52.800> they<00:02:53.400> won't<00:02:53.580> be<00:02:53.640> doing

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
on you at a time so they won't be doing

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.150 
on you at a time so they won't be doing
too<00:02:54.300> much<00:02:54.480> damage<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:55.560> you'll<00:02:55.950> have

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
too much damage to and you'll have

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.540 
too much damage to and you'll have
plenty<00:02:56.400> of<00:02:56.610> time<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:56.940> recover<00:02:57.840> from<00:02:58.020> them<00:02:58.550> so

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
plenty of time to recover from them so

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.170 
plenty of time to recover from them so
here<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.940> fire<00:03:00.120> giant<00:03:00.830> there's<00:03:01.830> a<00:03:01.920> nice<00:03:02.190> group

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
here the fire giant there's a nice group

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.110 
here the fire giant there's a nice group
of<00:03:03.300> them<00:03:03.510> over<00:03:03.690> here<00:03:03.920> but<00:03:04.920> like<00:03:05.430> again<00:03:05.880> there

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
of them over here but like again there

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.910 
of them over here but like again there
are<00:03:06.240> those<00:03:06.450> wild<00:03:06.810> dogs<00:03:06.990> over<00:03:07.470> in<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.650> corner

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
are those wild dogs over in the corner

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.250 
are those wild dogs over in the corner
so<00:03:08.310> eventually<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.180> wild<00:03:09.390> dogs<00:03:09.570> will<00:03:09.960> become

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
so eventually the wild dogs will become

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.530 
so eventually the wild dogs will become
unaggressive<00:03:10.710> and<00:03:11.250> will<00:03:11.550> stop<00:03:11.820> attacking<00:03:12.180> you

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
in here behind the chair and I guess

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:02.869 
in here behind the chair and I guess
over<00:05:00.870> there<00:05:01.020> so<00:05:01.349> this<00:05:01.650> is<00:05:01.770> another<00:05:01.889> but<00:05:02.340> there

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:02.879 
over there so this is another but there

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:06.379 
over there so this is another but there
are<00:05:03.090> only<00:05:03.979> three<00:05:04.979> or<00:05:05.129> four<00:05:05.370> or<00:05:05.460> five<00:05:05.669> guys<00:05:06.060> in

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
are only three or four or five guys in

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.149 
are only three or four or five guys in
here<00:05:06.599> and<00:05:06.750> usually<00:05:07.470> there<00:05:07.650> are<00:05:07.680> a<00:05:07.860> lot<00:05:08.129> of

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:06.260 
hopefully I won't be dead so that's how

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.360 
hopefully I won't be dead so that's how
to<00:07:06.320> kill<00:07:06.620> fire<00:07:06.830> giants<00:07:07.340> um<00:07:08.290> the<00:07:09.290> drops<00:07:09.980> are

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:10.370 
to kill fire giants um the drops are

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.420 
to kill fire giants um the drops are
okay<00:07:11.150> you'll<00:07:11.630> probably<00:07:12.020> get<00:07:12.590> about<00:07:12.770> one<00:07:13.310> to

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:13.430 
okay you'll probably get about one to

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.420 
okay you'll probably get about one to
two<00:07:13.490> rooms<00:07:13.940> amuse<00:07:14.360> each<00:07:14.510> task<00:07:14.900> a<00:07:15.350> lot<00:07:15.920> of<00:07:16.160> fire

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:16.430 
two rooms amuse each task a lot of fire

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.690 
two rooms amuse each task a lot of fire
runs<00:07:16.780> some<00:07:17.780> golden<00:07:18.290> green<00:07:18.500> charms<00:07:18.980> and<00:07:19.460> did

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:19.700 
runs some golden green charms and did

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.980 
runs some golden green charms and did
you<00:07:19.850> drop<00:07:20.030> a<00:07:20.090> lot<00:07:20.360> of<00:07:20.570> arrows<00:07:21.530> as<00:07:21.980> well<00:07:22.220> so<00:07:22.990> that

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:23.990 
you drop a lot of arrows as well so that

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.170
