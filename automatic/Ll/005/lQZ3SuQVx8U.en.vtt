00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
complaining about how big it is and it's

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.330 
complaining about how big it is and it's
still<00:03:33.230> a<00:03:33.260> big<00:03:33.470> device<00:03:33.709> don't<00:03:33.980> get<00:03:34.070> me<00:03:34.160> wrong

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
still a big device don't get me wrong

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.060 
still a big device don't get me wrong
like<00:03:34.519> I<00:03:34.640> had<00:03:34.760> in<00:03:34.880> my<00:03:34.970> hand<00:03:35.150> with<00:03:35.360> my<00:03:35.450> coffee<00:03:35.630> cup

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
like I had in my hand with my coffee cup

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.740 
like I had in my hand with my coffee cup
it's<00:03:37.070> almost<00:03:37.489> impossible<00:03:37.880> to<00:03:38.239> carry<00:03:38.390> at<00:03:38.630> the

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
it's almost impossible to carry at the

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.690 
it's almost impossible to carry at the
same<00:03:38.900> time<00:03:39.140> so<00:03:39.500> if<00:03:39.950> you<00:03:40.070> do<00:03:40.220> something<00:03:40.430> like<00:03:40.519> me

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
same time so if you do something like me

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:41.770 
same time so if you do something like me
you<00:03:40.820> have<00:03:40.940> a<00:03:40.970> bunch<00:03:41.120> of<00:03:41.209> stuff<00:03:41.360> in<00:03:41.480> your<00:03:41.540> hands

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
you have a bunch of stuff in your hands

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.210 
you have a bunch of stuff in your hands
you<00:03:41.930> have<00:03:42.019> a<00:03:42.080> briefcase<00:03:42.350> your<00:03:42.739> back<00:03:42.920> whatever

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
you have a briefcase your back whatever

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.040 
you have a briefcase your back whatever
it<00:03:43.910> is<00:03:44.030> a<00:03:44.060> little<00:03:44.209> bit<00:03:44.330> harder<00:03:44.630> to<00:03:44.660> carry<00:03:44.959> in

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
it is a little bit harder to carry in

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.570 
it is a little bit harder to carry in
the<00:03:45.110> hand<00:03:45.290> it's<00:03:45.769> big<00:03:45.950> in<00:03:46.040> the<00:03:46.100> pocket<00:03:46.459> as<00:03:46.550> well

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
the hand it's big in the pocket as well

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.370 
the hand it's big in the pocket as well
but<00:03:46.820> the<00:03:46.910> trade-off<00:03:47.180> is<00:03:47.330> you<00:03:48.050> get<00:03:48.170> a<00:03:48.200> nice

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
but the trade-off is you get a nice
