00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello to all the viewers of my channel 

00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:08.370
 Yoga blog readers today I am together with 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:13.110
 I will make almond milk for you 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.730
 Then I'll take one cup of almond as well but 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.320
 it's already cleaned i pre it 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:24.960
 soaked overnight cleaned the skins and this one 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:27.900
 almond sprinkle blender many 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.779
 recommend to pour water at once to 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.940
 emulsify but i'm a little bit first 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:42.210
 smash the almonds and then fill it with one 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:52.879
 a glass of water pour 1 cup of purified 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:52.879
 some water and keep shaving it all off 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.300
 I got stuck big bowl 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:05.519
 almond milk 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:08.670
 here about half a liter remains 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.990
 Only strain this product through 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:16.020
 Marlechka if you want to make cocktails 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.400
 and add to various desserts then 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.130
 filter it all is not necessary 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.509
 because the consistency turned out 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.200
 gorgeous i.e. fines 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:31.350
 virtually no in this milk 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.990
 It turned out such a thick milk in contrast 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.009
 from cow this milk is completely 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:44.310
 absorbed by the body here is very very 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:46.740
 many nutrients vitamins proteins 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.979
 and so on all this more you can 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:54.869
 read the whole lineup on my yoga blog 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:58.320
 I will leave a link under the video so now 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.200
 let's start filtering it all I filtered 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:08.110
 milk through cheesecloth 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:10.860
 for this I will take a colander from almond 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.030
 milk can also be made different 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.380
 cheese and cottage cheese type 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:21.910
 but this we will do next time 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.720
 by the way almonds are very expensive now on 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.620
 Ukraine 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.770
 Yesterday was imported almonds and costs 180 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.830
 hryvnia kilo 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:35.070
 used to cost 100 hryvnia a kilo read 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:39.420
 twice the price of products 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:42.580
 there are still so many pomace left 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.820
 almond is a very useful product 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:49.800
 Almonds went up twice 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:53.739
 it is not related to political events 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:03:04.870
 in Ukraine and just with bad karma of this 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:07.209
 almond milk states I made 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.489
 according to the classic recipe that is not 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.190
 added to it no honey no physics no 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.290
 all sorts of 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.080
 flavoring sweeteners type 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.760
