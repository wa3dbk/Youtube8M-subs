00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
came to build quality now the s5 I was

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.680 
came to build quality now the s5 I was
supposed<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.309> remedy<00:01:02.699> all<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:03.059> these<00:01:03.210> problems

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.609 
but I feel like they addressed problems
that<00:01:05.700> didn't<00:01:06.000> need<00:01:06.119> addressing<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.990> didn't

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
that didn't need addressing and didn't

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.500 
that didn't need addressing and didn't
fix<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.920> ones<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.430> did<00:01:08.610> need<00:01:08.820> addressing<00:01:09.060> so

immensely this is what the problem was

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.190 
immensely this is what the problem was
on<00:03:07.799> the<00:03:07.889> s4<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:08.519> the<00:03:08.609> s4<00:03:09.000> I<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.359> you<00:03:09.719> can<00:03:09.750> still

at all now what I also want to talk

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.100 
at all now what I also want to talk
about<00:04:33.630> is<00:04:34.910> the<00:04:35.910> sound<00:04:36.150> now<00:04:36.420> it<00:04:36.450> has<00:04:36.720> the<00:04:36.900> same

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
about is the sound now it has the same

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.700 
about is the sound now it has the same
sound

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
sound

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.200 
sound
you<00:04:37.890> got<00:04:38.070> the<00:04:38.190> thumping<00:04:38.610> bass<00:04:38.790> you<00:04:38.970> have<00:04:39.090> the

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
you got the thumping bass you have the

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.150 
you got the thumping bass you have the
smooth<00:04:39.540> mids<00:04:39.870> and<00:04:40.170> you<00:04:40.410> have<00:04:40.530> the<00:04:40.620> nice<00:04:40.830> but

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
smooth mids and you have the nice but

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.910 
smooth mids and you have the nice but
generally<00:04:41.760> shadowed<00:04:42.240> a<00:04:42.450> high-end<00:04:43.050> they<00:04:43.770> use

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
generally shadowed a high-end they use

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.590 
generally shadowed a high-end they use
identical<00:04:44.100> drivers<00:04:44.760> to<00:04:44.940> the<00:04:44.970> s4i

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
identical drivers to the s4i

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.390 
identical drivers to the s4i
and<00:04:45.780> so<00:04:46.170> the<00:04:46.320> sound<00:04:46.530> shouldn't<00:04:46.860> be<00:04:46.980> much<00:04:47.190> to

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
and so the sound shouldn't be much to

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.010 
and so the sound shouldn't be much to
any<00:04:47.550> different<00:04:47.760> and<00:04:48.090> it's<00:04:48.210> not<00:04:48.420> but<00:04:48.630> I<00:04:48.690> do<00:04:48.750> want

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
any different and it's not but I do want

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.390 
any different and it's not but I do want
to<00:04:49.080> mention<00:04:49.320> again<00:04:49.440> that<00:04:49.620> that<00:04:49.890> cable<00:04:50.250> noise

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
to mention again that that cable noise

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.550 
to mention again that that cable noise
will<00:04:50.670> interfere<00:04:51.150> with<00:04:51.210> your<00:04:51.390> with<00:04:52.200> your<00:04:52.230> sound

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
will interfere with your with your sound

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.410

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
but other than that it's pretty good you

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.760 
but other than that it's pretty good you
get<00:04:54.510> superior<00:04:55.020> imaging<00:04:55.470> instrument

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770

separation<00:04:56.490> is<00:04:56.580> really<00:04:56.850> really<00:04:57.030> awesome<00:04:57.420> and

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
separation is really really awesome and

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.180

on<00:04:57.600> the<00:04:57.720> sound<00:04:57.960> forefront<00:04:58.470> of<00:04:58.560> things<00:04:58.740> it's

great<00:04:59.400> but<00:05:00.030> the<00:05:00.120> rest<00:05:00.240> of<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:00.480> headphones

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
great but the rest of the headphones

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.990 
great but the rest of the headphones
make<00:05:00.990> me<00:05:01.170> wonder<00:05:01.410> are<00:05:02.250> they<00:05:02.400> really<00:05:02.760> worth

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
make me wonder are they really worth

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.150

telephone calls you have this cord that

great<00:05:19.680> I<00:05:19.740> mean<00:05:19.890> it<00:05:20.100> is<00:05:20.220> a<00:05:20.250> little<00:05:20.580> bit<00:05:20.730> nicer

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970

these<00:05:34.890> sound<00:05:35.130> like<00:05:35.190> 10<00:05:35.550> or<00:05:35.700> $15<00:05:36.180> here<00:05:36.420> buds

once you get that in once you have that

once you get that in once you have that
perfect<00:05:39.090> isolation<00:05:39.810> that<00:05:39.840> base<00:05:40.200> will<00:05:40.440> come<00:05:40.650> in

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
perfect isolation that base will come in

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.230 
perfect isolation that base will come in
to<00:05:40.920> things<00:05:41.130> the<00:05:41.400> mids<00:05:41.640> will<00:05:41.850> get<00:05:41.970> a<00:05:42.000> lot

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
to things the mids will get a lot

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.730 
to things the mids will get a lot
clearer<00:05:42.510> that<00:05:42.690> imaging<00:05:43.170> will<00:05:43.320> get<00:05:43.470> a<00:05:43.500> lot<00:05:43.710> more

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
clearer that imaging will get a lot more

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.890

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
superior but without that seal which I

superior but without that seal which I
could<00:05:46.140> not<00:05:46.380> achieve<00:05:46.910> they're<00:05:47.910> not<00:05:48.120> good<00:05:48.360> so

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.140 
could not achieve they're not good so

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.500 
could not achieve they're not good so
what<00:05:49.800> I<00:05:49.830> would<00:05:49.950> say<00:05:50.220> is<00:05:50.370> if<00:05:50.580> these<00:05:50.760> and<00:05:51.090> the<00:05:51.150> s4

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
what I would say is if these and the s4

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.600 
what I would say is if these and the s4
eye<00:05:51.540> are<00:05:51.780> the<00:05:51.810> same<00:05:52.080> price<00:05:52.320> get<00:05:52.800> the<00:05:52.950> s4<00:05:53.340> eye<00:05:53.370> if

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
eye are the same price get the s4 eye if

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.910 
eye are the same price get the s4 eye if
the<00:05:53.940> s4<00:05:54.270> eye<00:05:54.300> are<00:05:54.630> more<00:05:54.900> expensive<00:05:55.260> than<00:05:55.800> the

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:55.920 
the s4 eye are more expensive than the

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.820 
the s4 eye are more expensive than the
s5<00:05:56.280> I<00:05:56.460> still<00:05:57.030> get<00:05:57.150> the<00:05:57.270> s4<00:05:57.630> eye<00:05:57.710> you're<00:05:58.710> going

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
s5 I still get the s4 eye you're going

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.650 
s5 I still get the s4 eye you're going
to<00:05:58.950> experience<00:05:59.250> a<00:05:59.520> lot<00:05:59.670> better<00:05:59.730> isolation<00:06:00.540> the

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
to experience a lot better isolation the

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.430 
to experience a lot better isolation the
