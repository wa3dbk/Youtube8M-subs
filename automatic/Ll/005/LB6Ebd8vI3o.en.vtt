00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.130 
apple and make his his neck look really
strong<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.460> then<00:02:00.360> powerful

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
strong and then powerful

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.809 
strong and then powerful
the<00:02:01.439> long<00:02:01.619> neck<00:02:01.829> also<00:02:02.130> makes<00:02:02.310> him<00:02:02.460> look<00:02:02.610> more

00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:02.819 
the long neck also makes him look more

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:05.719 
the long neck also makes him look more
alert<00:02:03.179> and<00:02:03.420> awake<00:02:04.039> since<00:02:05.039> he<00:02:05.159> isn't<00:02:05.429> the<00:02:05.520> sort

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
alert and awake since he isn't the sort

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.910 
alert and awake since he isn't the sort
of<00:02:05.819> dumb<00:02:06.090> slow<00:02:06.750> kind<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.170> character<00:02:07.469> he's<00:02:07.649> more

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
of dumb slow kind of character he's more

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.969 
of dumb slow kind of character he's more
than<00:02:08.099> straightforward<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.769> a<00:02:10.769> bit

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
than straightforward and and a bit

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.160 
than straightforward and and a bit
simple<00:02:11.310> minded<00:02:11.580> character<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:12.569> I<00:02:12.599> think<00:02:12.840> the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
simple minded character so I think the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.199 
simple minded character so I think the
the<00:02:13.500> long<00:02:13.650> leg<00:02:13.830> is<00:02:13.950> good<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.310> keep<00:02:14.489> him<00:02:14.700> more

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
the long leg is good to keep him more

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.710 
the long leg is good to keep him more
awake<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.750> not<00:02:15.810> as<00:02:15.989> slow<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.410> dumb<00:02:16.650> looking

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
awake and not as slow and dumb looking

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.050 
awake and not as slow and dumb looking
but<00:02:18.720> that's<00:02:18.900> basically<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.590> head<00:02:19.819> here's<00:02:20.819> how

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
but that's basically the head here's how

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.059 
but that's basically the head here's how
to<00:02:21.120> draw<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.840> whole<00:02:22.140> body<00:02:22.440> of<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.739> lutheran

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
to draw the whole body of a lutheran

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.390 
to draw the whole body of a lutheran
again<00:02:23.760> I<00:02:23.940> start<00:02:24.239> out<00:02:24.360> with<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.750> simple<00:02:25.079> shapes

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
again I start out with the simple shapes

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.610 
again I start out with the simple shapes
his<00:02:26.400> torso<00:02:26.760> is<00:02:27.120> big<00:02:27.690> square<00:02:27.989> and<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.380> same

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
his torso is big square and the same

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.830 
his torso is big square and the same
with<00:02:28.769> his<00:02:28.860> pelvis<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:30.120> pelvis<00:02:30.390> is<00:02:30.510> just<00:02:30.750> a

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
with his pelvis the pelvis is just a

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.319 
with his pelvis the pelvis is just a
smaller<00:02:31.170> square<00:02:31.680> then<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.670> have<00:02:32.849> the<00:02:32.970> sausage

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
smaller square then you have the sausage

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.199 
smaller square then you have the sausage
again<00:02:33.500> just<00:02:34.500> above<00:02:34.739> the<00:02:34.920> middle<00:02:35.099> here<00:02:35.340> this

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
again just above the middle here this

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.140 
again just above the middle here this
time<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.660> then<00:02:36.930> you<00:02:37.079> I<00:02:37.489> do<00:02:38.489> this<00:02:38.700> curvy<00:02:39.030> line

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
time and then you I do this curvy line

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.180 
time and then you I do this curvy line
here<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.510> indicate<00:02:39.870> which<00:02:40.110> way<00:02:40.319> his<00:02:40.590> pelvis<00:02:41.040> is

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
here to indicate which way his pelvis is

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.280 
here to indicate which way his pelvis is
pointing<00:02:41.940> yeah<00:02:42.450> because<00:02:42.660> that<00:02:42.810> that

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
pointing yeah because that that

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.960 
pointing yeah because that that
indicates<00:02:43.650> also<00:02:44.069> how<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.310> movement<00:02:44.819> of<00:02:44.880> this

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
indicates also how the movement of this

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.599 
indicates also how the movement of this
body<00:02:45.239> is<00:02:45.329> going<00:02:45.359> to<00:02:45.569> be<00:02:45.950> then<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.100> legs<00:02:47.340> here

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
body is going to be then the legs here

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.840 
body is going to be then the legs here
is<00:02:47.870> just<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:49.019> indicate<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:50.010> proportions<00:02:50.609> and

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
is just to indicate the proportions and

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.660 
is just to indicate the proportions and
and<00:02:51.290> figure<00:02:52.290> out<00:02:52.319> like<00:02:52.650> why<00:02:53.459> are<00:02:53.519> they

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
and figure out like why are they

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.819 
and figure out like why are they
pointing<00:02:53.910> what<00:02:54.269> are<00:02:54.389> they<00:02:54.510> doing<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:55.590> small

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
pointing what are they doing the small

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.830 
pointing what are they doing the small
servants<00:02:56.639> to<00:02:56.730> do<00:02:56.850> is<00:02:57.030> indicating<00:02:57.480> both<00:02:57.630> the

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
servants to do is indicating both the

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.650 
servants to do is indicating both the
elbows<00:02:58.139> and<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.500> knees<00:02:58.530> you<00:02:59.329> when<00:03:00.329> I'm<00:03:00.420> happy

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
elbows and the knees you when I'm happy

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.740 
elbows and the knees you when I'm happy
with<00:03:00.840> how<00:03:01.049> this<00:03:01.260> looks<00:03:01.530> I<00:03:02.040> go<00:03:02.819> into<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.480> next

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
with how this looks I go into the next

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.680 
with how this looks I go into the next
step<00:03:03.900> which<00:03:04.139> is<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.680> details<00:03:05.480> it's<00:03:06.480> really

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
step which is the details it's really

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.410 
step which is the details it's really
important<00:03:07.079> to<00:03:07.170> start<00:03:07.380> out<00:03:07.560> with<00:03:07.940> just<00:03:08.940> the

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
important to start out with just the

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.479 
important to start out with just the
basic<00:03:09.840> shapes<00:03:10.079> and<00:03:10.319> the<00:03:10.680> construction<00:03:11.160> of<00:03:11.340> the

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
basic shapes and the construction of the

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.610 
basic shapes and the construction of the
character<00:03:11.790> first<00:03:12.049> because<00:03:13.049> if<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:13.290> go<00:03:13.440> into

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
character first because if you go into

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.500 
character first because if you go into
the<00:03:13.859> details<00:03:14.220> too<00:03:14.459> early<00:03:14.819> you<00:03:15.030> might<00:03:15.209> end<00:03:15.420> up

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
the details too early you might end up

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.240 
the details too early you might end up
killing<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:16.079> the<00:03:16.470> movement<00:03:16.680> of<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.010> drawing

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
killing the the movement of the drawing

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.530 
killing the the movement of the drawing
or<00:03:17.639> your<00:03:18.269> proportions<00:03:18.780> might<00:03:18.989> end<00:03:19.170> up<00:03:19.260> wrong

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
or your proportions might end up wrong

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.650 
or your proportions might end up wrong
it's<00:03:21.110> a<00:03:21.260> step<00:03:21.500> we<00:03:21.650> can<00:03:21.890> we<00:03:22.250> can<00:03:22.430> still<00:03:22.670> correct

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
it's a step we can we can still correct

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.090 
it's a step we can we can still correct
your<00:03:23.840> mistakes<00:03:24.230> because<00:03:24.620> you<00:03:24.740> have<00:03:24.830> been

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
your mistakes because you have been

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.160 
your mistakes because you have been
drawing<00:03:25.310> it<00:03:25.490> that<00:03:25.730> hard<00:03:26.360> as<00:03:26.600> you<00:03:26.720> can<00:03:26.870> see<00:03:27.020> I'm

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
drawing it that hard as you can see I'm

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.980 
drawing it that hard as you can see I'm
pressing<00:03:27.980> a<00:03:28.040> little<00:03:28.130> bit<00:03:28.250> harder<00:03:28.580> now<00:03:28.990> since

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 
pressing a little bit harder now since

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.949 
pressing a little bit harder now since
I'm<00:03:30.340> I'm<00:03:31.340> going<00:03:31.970> for<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:32.270> details<00:03:32.600> now<00:03:32.810> I'm

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
I'm I'm going for the details now I'm

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.780 
I'm I'm going for the details now I'm
sort<00:03:33.170> of<00:03:33.230> putting<00:03:33.650> things<00:03:33.860> down<00:03:34.160> and<00:03:34.430> letting

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
sort of putting things down and letting

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.730 
sort of putting things down and letting
it<00:03:34.910> kind<00:03:35.450> of<00:03:35.569> kind<00:03:35.900> of<00:03:35.959> locking<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:36.410> character

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
it kind of kind of locking the character

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.390 
it kind of kind of locking the character
down<00:03:38.350> so<00:03:39.350> the<00:03:39.500> construction<00:03:39.890> part<00:03:40.130> is<00:03:40.310> the

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
down so the construction part is the

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.680 
down so the construction part is the
phase<00:03:40.640> where<00:03:40.850> you<00:03:40.910> can<00:03:40.940> go<00:03:41.180> in<00:03:41.300> and<00:03:41.450> sort<00:03:41.600> of

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
phase where you can go in and sort of

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.360 
phase where you can go in and sort of
feel<00:03:42.170> your<00:03:42.350> way<00:03:42.470> through<00:03:42.530> the<00:03:42.800> drawing<00:03:43.040> before

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
feel your way through the drawing before

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.590 
feel your way through the drawing before
you're<00:03:43.670> going<00:03:43.880> and<00:03:44.030> take<00:03:44.180> the<00:03:44.300> final

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
you're going and take the final

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.160 
you're going and take the final
decisions<00:03:46.120> another<00:03:47.120> really<00:03:47.510> important<00:03:47.959> step

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
decisions another really important step

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.600 
decisions another really important step
of<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:49.370> detail<00:03:49.940> part<00:03:50.180> here<00:03:50.480> is<00:03:50.660> is<00:03:51.610> finding

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
of the detail part here is is finding

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.750 
of the detail part here is is finding
the<00:03:52.730> overlaps<00:03:53.209> on<00:03:53.660> the<00:03:53.870> character<00:03:54.760> it's

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
the overlaps on the character it's

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.120 
the overlaps on the character it's
important<00:03:56.239> to<00:03:56.390> let<00:03:56.510> the<00:03:56.630> care<00:03:56.840> to<00:03:56.989> be<00:03:57.200> shapes

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
important to let the care to be shapes

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.130 
important to let the care to be shapes
and<00:03:58.430> not<00:03:58.610> outline<00:03:59.030> and<00:03:59.510> you<00:03:59.540> do<00:03:59.780> that<00:03:59.959> by

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
and not outline and you do that by

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.870 
and not outline and you do that by
letting<00:04:00.680> things<00:04:01.010> overlap<00:04:01.610> each<00:04:01.730> other

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
letting things overlap each other

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.850 
letting things overlap each other
because<00:04:02.840> then<00:04:02.959> you<00:04:03.050> can<00:04:03.170> see<00:04:03.320> how<00:04:03.470> the<00:04:03.530> shapes

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
because then you can see how the shapes

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.270 
because then you can see how the shapes
connect<00:04:04.310> and<00:04:04.900> not<00:04:05.900> just<00:04:06.110> go<00:04:06.320> directly<00:04:06.380> from

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
connect and not just go directly from

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.160 
connect and not just go directly from
one<00:04:07.760> to<00:04:07.970> another<00:04:08.000> as<00:04:08.420> you<00:04:08.600> can<00:04:08.720> see<00:04:08.870> the<00:04:09.019> elbow

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
one to another as you can see the elbow

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.660 
one to another as you can see the elbow
right<00:04:09.440> there<00:04:09.650> goes<00:04:09.830> a<00:04:09.860> little<00:04:10.070> bit<00:04:10.280> out<00:04:10.459> of<00:04:10.489> the

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
right there goes a little bit out of the

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.620 
right there goes a little bit out of the
shape<00:04:10.880> but<00:04:11.209> then<00:04:11.330> back<00:04:11.480> into<00:04:11.750> his<00:04:12.610> Islam<00:04:13.630> and

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
shape but then back into his Islam and

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.170 
shape but then back into his Islam and
it<00:04:14.900> is<00:04:15.050> it<00:04:15.320> just<00:04:15.530> shows<00:04:15.739> how<00:04:15.769> how<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:16.519> elbow<00:04:17.000> is

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
it is it just shows how how the elbow is

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.409 
it is it just shows how how the elbow is
part<00:04:17.480> of<00:04:17.600> a<00:04:17.930> shape<00:04:18.680> and<00:04:18.980> it's<00:04:19.190> it's<00:04:19.489> like<00:04:20.000> it's

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
part of a shape and it's it's like it's

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:21.940 
part of a shape and it's it's like it's
as<00:04:20.630> I<00:04:20.660> said<00:04:20.900> shapes<00:04:21.230> connecting<00:04:21.799> to<00:04:21.919> each

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
as I said shapes connecting to each

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.159 
as I said shapes connecting to each
other<00:04:22.250> and<00:04:23.210> it's<00:04:23.390> the<00:04:23.510> same<00:04:23.720> with<00:04:23.870> the<00:04:23.960> belt

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
other and it's the same with the belt

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.260 
other and it's the same with the belt
there<00:04:24.440> that<00:04:24.710> it's<00:04:24.890> a<00:04:25.160> bit<00:04:25.490> sticking<00:04:25.880> out<00:04:26.030> of

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
there that it's a bit sticking out of

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.960 
there that it's a bit sticking out of
the<00:04:27.080> pelvis<00:04:27.440> because<00:04:28.370> if<00:04:28.520> I<00:04:28.610> had<00:04:28.729> drawn<00:04:28.940> it

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
the pelvis because if I had drawn it

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.480 
the pelvis because if I had drawn it
just<00:04:29.300> directly<00:04:29.830> inside<00:04:30.830> the<00:04:30.890> shape<00:04:31.250> it<00:04:31.400> would

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
just directly inside the shape it would

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.940 
just directly inside the shape it would
look<00:04:31.610> like<00:04:31.760> it<00:04:31.880> was<00:04:32.000> a<00:04:32.030> printed<00:04:32.540> thing<00:04:33.500> on<00:04:33.740> the

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
look like it was a printed thing on the

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.190 
look like it was a printed thing on the
on<00:04:34.190> the<00:04:34.310> pants<00:04:34.640> instead<00:04:35.600> of<00:04:35.720> being<00:04:35.930> a<00:04:36.050> new

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
on the pants instead of being a new

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.700 
on the pants instead of being a new
thing<00:04:36.550> on<00:04:37.550> top<00:04:37.850> of<00:04:37.910> it<00:04:38.470> that's<00:04:39.470> really

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
thing on top of it that's really

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.030 
thing on top of it that's really
important<00:04:40.040> to<00:04:40.130> think<00:04:40.280> about<00:04:41.710> here<00:04:42.710> I'm<00:04:42.890> making

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
important to think about here I'm making

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.680 
important to think about here I'm making
the<00:04:43.370> knees<00:04:43.669> just<00:04:43.940> a<00:04:44.060> little<00:04:44.090> bit<00:04:44.479> longer

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
the knees just a little bit longer

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.050 
the knees just a little bit longer
because<00:04:45.050> when<00:04:45.890> doing<00:04:46.220> these<00:04:46.370> things<00:04:46.700> when<00:04:46.970> do

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
because when doing these things when do

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.820 
because when doing these things when do
any<00:04:47.240> details<00:04:47.630> I<00:04:47.810> could<00:04:47.990> fit<00:04:48.229> I<00:04:48.260> could<00:04:48.530> see<00:04:48.680> that

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
any details I could fit I could see that

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.100 
any details I could fit I could see that
I<00:04:48.890> was<00:04:49.010> I<00:04:49.400> was<00:04:50.270> a<00:04:50.300> bit<00:04:50.540> wrong<00:04:50.720> in<00:04:50.990> my

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
I was I was a bit wrong in my

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.950 
I was I was a bit wrong in my
construction<00:04:51.669> but<00:04:52.669> as<00:04:52.880> I<00:04:52.910> said<00:04:53.210> before<00:04:53.270> the

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
construction but as I said before the

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.570 
construction but as I said before the
good<00:04:54.470> thing<00:04:54.650> about<00:04:54.740> the<00:04:54.979> construction<00:04:55.460> is

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
good thing about the construction is

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.250 
good thing about the construction is
that<00:04:55.610> you<00:04:56.060> pressed<00:04:56.330> so<00:04:56.510> lightly<00:04:56.720> that<00:04:57.020> you<00:04:57.110> can

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
that you pressed so lightly that you can

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.659 
that you pressed so lightly that you can
still<00:04:57.500> fix<00:04:57.740> it<00:04:57.890> a<00:04:57.979> little<00:04:58.190> bit<00:04:58.310> when<00:04:58.460> you<00:04:58.520> go

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
still fix it a little bit when you go

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:01.150 
still fix it a little bit when you go
through<00:04:58.880> the<00:04:59.120> detail<00:04:59.750> path

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
through the detail path

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.270 
through the detail path
so<00:05:01.730> don't<00:05:01.910> be<00:05:02.090> scared<00:05:02.150> of<00:05:02.510> of<00:05:03.280> adjusting

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
so don't be scared of of adjusting

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.360 
so don't be scared of of adjusting
things<00:05:04.520> as<00:05:04.670> you<00:05:04.820> go<00:05:04.940> along<00:05:05.590> just<00:05:06.590> because<00:05:07.190> you

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
things as you go along just because you

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.190 
things as you go along just because you
feel<00:05:07.850> like<00:05:07.910> you<00:05:08.150> are<00:05:08.180> done<00:05:08.900> with<00:05:09.110> the

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
feel like you are done with the

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.600 
feel like you are done with the
construction<00:05:09.590> part<00:05:09.920> it<00:05:10.100> doesn't<00:05:10.250> mean<00:05:10.460> that

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
construction part it doesn't mean that

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.420 
construction part it doesn't mean that
it<00:05:11.000> has<00:05:11.180> to<00:05:11.360> be<00:05:11.510> where<00:05:11.690> you<00:05:11.780> put<00:05:11.990> it<00:05:12.430> the

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
it has to be where you put it the

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.480 
it has to be where you put it the
construction<00:05:13.970> is<00:05:14.120> more<00:05:14.590> sort<00:05:15.590> of<00:05:15.650> a<00:05:15.920> phase

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
construction is more sort of a phase

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.430 
construction is more sort of a phase
where<00:05:16.730> you<00:05:16.820> feel<00:05:17.210> the<00:05:17.690> drawing<00:05:17.960> and<00:05:18.170> you<00:05:18.260> sort

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
where you feel the drawing and you sort

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.860 
where you feel the drawing and you sort
of<00:05:18.730> play<00:05:19.730> around<00:05:19.850> with<00:05:20.060> the<00:05:20.210> idea<00:05:20.240> of<00:05:20.660> what<00:05:20.840> you

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
of play around with the idea of what you

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.210 
of play around with the idea of what you
want<00:05:21.110> the<00:05:21.200> drawing<00:05:21.440> to<00:05:21.590> end<00:05:21.860> up<00:05:22.040> looking<00:05:22.220> like

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
want the drawing to end up looking like

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.350 
want the drawing to end up looking like
again<00:05:25.220> another<00:05:25.490> really<00:05:25.700> good<00:05:25.790> overlap<00:05:26.060> there

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
again another really good overlap there

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.360 
again another really good overlap there
is<00:05:26.540> how<00:05:27.320> the<00:05:27.380> neck<00:05:27.650> goes<00:05:27.920> into<00:05:28.460> the<00:05:29.210> torso<00:05:30.370> so

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
is how the neck goes into the torso so

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.710 
is how the neck goes into the torso so
it<00:05:31.400> connects<00:05:31.790> with<00:05:31.940> the<00:05:32.090> shape<00:05:32.300> instead<00:05:32.630> of

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
it connects with the shape instead of

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.410 
it connects with the shape instead of
being<00:05:32.960> flat<00:05:33.920> on<00:05:34.190> it<00:05:34.310> then<00:05:34.880> you<00:05:34.910> can<00:05:35.090> see<00:05:35.270> that

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:35.420 
being flat on it then you can see that

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.770 
being flat on it then you can see that
his<00:05:35.570> head<00:05:35.840> is<00:05:35.990> a<00:05:36.320> bit<00:05:36.590> in<00:05:36.770> front<00:05:37.040> of<00:05:37.130> his<00:05:37.250> torso

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
his head is a bit in front of his torso

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.690 
his head is a bit in front of his torso
that<00:05:38.780> is<00:05:38.900> way<00:05:39.050> the<00:05:39.080> basic<00:05:39.470> steps<00:05:39.830> of<00:05:40.310> coming

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:40.700 
that is way the basic steps of coming

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:47.490 
that is way the basic steps of coming
through<00:05:40.730> a<00:05:40.850> drawn

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.320 

this<00:05:48.500> last<00:05:48.740> one<00:05:48.890> here<00:05:49.100> is<00:05:49.130> just<00:05:49.550> showing<00:05:50.120> how<00:05:50.300> I

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
this last one here is just showing how I

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.540 
this last one here is just showing how I
I<00:05:50.900> do<00:05:51.140> it<00:05:51.380> more<00:05:51.530> practically<00:05:52.190> or<00:05:52.310> when<00:05:52.430> I'm

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
I do it more practically or when I'm

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.310 
I do it more practically or when I'm
posing<00:05:52.820> the<00:05:53.090> character<00:05:53.480> carried<00:05:53.900> out<00:05:54.080> in<00:05:54.230> a

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
posing the character carried out in a

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.860 
posing the character carried out in a
different<00:05:54.470> way<00:05:55.060> as<00:05:56.060> you<00:05:56.210> can<00:05:56.330> see<00:05:56.510> here<00:05:56.720> I'm

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
different way as you can see here I'm

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.830 
different way as you can see here I'm
still<00:05:57.500> indicating<00:05:58.100> with<00:05:58.510> just<00:05:59.510> a<00:05:59.600> few<00:05:59.780> lines

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 
still indicating with just a few lines

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.710 
still indicating with just a few lines
and<00:06:00.580> simple<00:06:01.580> shapes<00:06:01.850> where<00:06:02.180> I<00:06:02.210> want<00:06:02.390> things<00:06:02.660> to

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 
and simple shapes where I want things to

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.260 
and simple shapes where I want things to
be<00:06:02.840> and<00:06:03.230> what<00:06:03.980> is<00:06:04.100> the<00:06:04.280> general<00:06:04.490> shapes<00:06:04.910> and

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
be and what is the general shapes and

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.480 
be and what is the general shapes and
size<00:06:05.600> of<00:06:05.810> things<00:06:06.020> so<00:06:06.650> finding<00:06:07.340> the<00:06:07.460> right

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
size of things so finding the right

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.640 
size of things so finding the right
proportions<00:06:08.150> for<00:06:08.300> the<00:06:08.360> character<00:06:08.690> but<00:06:09.620> you

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
proportions for the character but you

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:10.840 
proportions for the character but you
can<00:06:09.770> also<00:06:09.920> see<00:06:10.130> that<00:06:10.280> I'm<00:06:10.400> actually<00:06:10.580> adding

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:10.850 
can also see that I'm actually adding

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.680 
can also see that I'm actually adding
some<00:06:11.120> detail<00:06:11.450> as<00:06:11.630> I<00:06:11.660> go<00:06:12.310> human<00:06:13.310> there<00:06:13.520> and<00:06:14.510> it's

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.690 
some detail as I go human there and it's

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.040 
some detail as I go human there and it's
mostly<00:06:15.020> because<00:06:15.610> if<00:06:16.610> I<00:06:16.760> feel<00:06:16.940> like<00:06:17.150> there<00:06:17.420> is<00:06:17.540> a

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
mostly because if I feel like there is a

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.770 
mostly because if I feel like there is a
movement<00:06:18.710> that<00:06:18.950> I'm<00:06:19.420> getting<00:06:20.420> from<00:06:20.660> the

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
movement that I'm getting from the

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.250 
movement that I'm getting from the
character<00:06:21.200> or<00:06:21.740> like<00:06:22.100> a<00:06:22.540> an<00:06:23.540> overlap<00:06:24.050> that<00:06:24.200> I

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:24.260 
character or like a an overlap that I

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.080 
character or like a an overlap that I
think<00:06:24.560> will<00:06:24.710> explain<00:06:25.070> the<00:06:25.580> drawing<00:06:25.850> a<00:06:25.940> bit

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
think will explain the drawing a bit

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.840 
think will explain the drawing a bit
more<00:06:26.330> I<00:06:26.540> put<00:06:27.410> it<00:06:27.500> in<00:06:27.590> as<00:06:27.740> I<00:06:27.770> go<00:06:28.010> to<00:06:28.070> test<00:06:28.490> to<00:06:28.640> see

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:28.850 
more I put it in as I go to test to see

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.670 
more I put it in as I go to test to see
if<00:06:28.880> the<00:06:29.330> movement<00:06:29.690> in<00:06:29.780> that<00:06:29.930> way<00:06:30.080> is<00:06:30.350> going<00:06:30.590> to

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 
if the movement in that way is going to

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.280 
if the movement in that way is going to
work<00:06:30.860> as<00:06:31.010> I'm<00:06:31.160> thinking<00:06:31.640> it<00:06:31.910> might<00:06:32.690> will<00:06:32.900> and

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:33.290 
work as I'm thinking it might will and

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.320 
work as I'm thinking it might will and
if<00:06:34.070> I<00:06:34.220> if<00:06:34.460> I<00:06:34.550> can<00:06:34.700> see<00:06:34.850> that<00:06:35.000> it's<00:06:35.120> going<00:06:35.240> to

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.330 
if I if I can see that it's going to

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.820 
if I if I can see that it's going to
work<00:06:35.390> that's<00:06:35.720> when<00:06:35.870> I<00:06:35.900> push<00:06:36.500> a<00:06:36.590> little<00:06:36.680> bit

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 
work that's when I push a little bit

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.960 
work that's when I push a little bit
harder<00:06:36.890> and<00:06:37.310> then<00:06:37.460> put<00:06:37.700> the<00:06:37.820> line<00:06:38.000> down<00:06:39.400> and<00:06:40.400> I

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970 
harder and then put the line down and I

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:42.430 
harder and then put the line down and I
think<00:06:41.210> it's<00:06:41.330> it's<00:06:41.570> important<00:06:41.990> to<00:06:42.050> find<00:06:42.290> your

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 
think it's it's important to find your

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.260 
think it's it's important to find your
own<00:06:42.560> sort<00:06:42.830> of<00:06:42.860> rhythm<00:06:43.250> with<00:06:43.670> the<00:06:43.850> construction

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.270 
own sort of rhythm with the construction

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.000 
own sort of rhythm with the construction
pad<00:06:45.190> because<00:06:46.190> it<00:06:46.220> can<00:06:46.490> easily<00:06:46.670> become<00:06:46.940> very

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.010 
pad because it can easily become very

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.740 
pad because it can easily become very
mechanical<00:06:49.010> or<00:06:49.250> almost<00:06:49.550> like<00:06:49.730> I'm<00:06:49.880> at<00:06:50.720> the

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:50.750 
mechanical or almost like I'm at the

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.960 
mechanical or almost like I'm at the
medical<00:06:51.140> tasks<00:06:51.380> you<00:06:51.560> have<00:06:51.590> to<00:06:51.800> solve<00:06:52.070> if

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:52.970 
medical tasks you have to solve if

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.170 
medical tasks you have to solve if
everything<00:06:53.450> just<00:06:53.600> turns<00:06:53.840> into<00:06:53.990> squares<00:06:54.470> and

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:55.180 
everything just turns into squares and

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.750 
everything just turns into squares and
circles<00:06:56.180> and<00:06:56.720> shapes<00:06:56.750> and<00:06:57.260> sausages<00:06:57.710> and<00:06:57.980> not

00:06:58.750 --> 00:06:58.760 
circles and shapes and sausages and not

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.460 
circles and shapes and sausages and not
really<00:06:59.000> thinking<00:06:59.240> about<00:06:59.330> that<00:06:59.660> it's<00:06:59.990> in<00:07:00.290> the

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:00.470 
really thinking about that it's in the

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.760 
really thinking about that it's in the
end<00:07:00.590> it<00:07:00.680> it<00:07:00.920> has<00:07:01.130> to<00:07:01.280> end<00:07:01.430> up<00:07:01.550> as<00:07:01.820> a<00:07:01.850> character

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:02.770 
end it it has to end up as a character

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.380 
end it it has to end up as a character
then<00:07:03.770> you<00:07:03.860> can<00:07:04.010> end<00:07:04.130> up<00:07:04.280> killing<00:07:04.550> the<00:07:04.850> the<00:07:05.210> life

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:05.390 
then you can end up killing the the life

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.840 
then you can end up killing the the life
of<00:07:05.810> that<00:07:05.990> drawing<00:07:06.230> and<00:07:06.530> having<00:07:07.340> it<00:07:07.460> be<00:07:07.580> really

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:07.850 
of that drawing and having it be really

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:11.830 
of that drawing and having it be really
stiff<00:07:08.090> and<00:07:09.580> so<00:07:10.580> I<00:07:10.610> think<00:07:10.820> it's<00:07:11.060> it's<00:07:11.300> important

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 
stiff and so I think it's it's important

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.350 
stiff and so I think it's it's important
to<00:07:11.900> find<00:07:12.140> your<00:07:12.200> own<00:07:12.410> balance<00:07:13.250> of<00:07:13.610> the

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:14.360 
to find your own balance of the

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.060 
to find your own balance of the
construction<00:07:14.960> but<00:07:15.170> still<00:07:15.410> thinking<00:07:15.800> that<00:07:15.920> it

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:16.070 
construction but still thinking that it

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:17.680 
construction but still thinking that it
has<00:07:16.190> to<00:07:16.310> end<00:07:16.340> up<00:07:16.580> looking<00:07:16.940> like<00:07:16.970> a<00:07:17.120> caries<00:07:17.480> iron

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:17.690 
has to end up looking like a caries iron

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.230 
has to end up looking like a caries iron
and<00:07:18.260> having<00:07:18.890> the<00:07:19.010> life<00:07:19.190> and<00:07:19.490> expression<00:07:19.760> that

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 
and having the life and expression that

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.440 
and having the life and expression that
a<00:07:20.300> character<00:07:20.660> is<00:07:21.020> supposed<00:07:21.530> to<00:07:21.860> have<00:07:22.390> so<00:07:23.390> as

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:23.450 
a character is supposed to have so as

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.270 
a character is supposed to have so as
you<00:07:23.570> can<00:07:23.660> see<00:07:23.870> here<00:07:24.080> even<00:07:24.320> though<00:07:24.500> I'm<00:07:24.680> I'm<00:07:25.100> not

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.280 
you can see here even though I'm I'm not

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.010 
you can see here even though I'm I'm not
done<00:07:25.490> with<00:07:25.520> positioning<00:07:26.390> everything<00:07:26.690> I<00:07:26.780> start

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:27.020 
done with positioning everything I start

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.810 
done with positioning everything I start
going<00:07:27.170> in<00:07:27.410> and<00:07:27.560> do<00:07:27.650> the<00:07:27.830> the<00:07:27.860> mustache<00:07:28.550> because

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:28.820 
going in and do the the mustache because

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.660 
going in and do the the mustache because
I<00:07:29.060> feel<00:07:29.270> that<00:07:29.350> how<00:07:30.350> they<00:07:30.560> how<00:07:30.800> that<00:07:31.040> position

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:31.670 
I feel that how they how that position

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.810 
I feel that how they how that position
is<00:07:31.880> going<00:07:32.090> to<00:07:32.180> be<00:07:33.340> explaining<00:07:34.340> the<00:07:34.460> drawing<00:07:34.730> a

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:34.820

lot yeah so I think generally the
construction<00:07:37.970> phase<00:07:38.210> of<00:07:38.240> the<00:07:38.540> drawing<00:07:38.750> is

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:38.930

what the drawing is going to be and then
