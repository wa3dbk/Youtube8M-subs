00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.760
 General of the type busatto of who speaks to you 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.349
 Welcome to one more 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.690
 episode that in our way the coach 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.490
 taxpayer and in this episode we are and 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.039
 that in the month of October therefore 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.770
 we have four more games to finish this 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.340
 month and we 'll only have three games one of them 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.050
 will be here against the brother of Raimi and 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.580
 not pronouncing league names 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.410
 Dutch so forget it 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.260
 then we'll have more game against 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.030
 I think that is how I pronounce it and 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.790
 Let's end the game for 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.649
 league europe against the bordeaux a game is 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.149
 important enough for us once we 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.010
 our team is disputing the 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.559
 first place in our group 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.469
 there with evil so let's start well 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.390
 with this game and incredible to say that now 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.149
 in the next episodes we will start 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.590
 have the league cup games and this is 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.539
 of those times without us we have to 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.030
 use all our players and will 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.699
 start to emerge the 11 and etc. 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.859
 and it is even the one that authorizes them not to 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.899
 you can always use the same team and 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.710
 you have to vote in our 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.240
 Hotel 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.610
 but here in this first game with the 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.619
 but also create several 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.229
 opportunities jackson martinez had a 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.570
 big shot but went to the figure 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.520
 of the long yard keeper a cute 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.710
 the sea ​​hitting the post because our 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.560
 team manages to recover my fragiliza 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.799
 the vacancy for jackson martinez back to 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.600
 poet turns brand and here is the first 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.759
 goal after 25 minutes 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.220
 I have already begun to make such an 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.860
 Our staff is I'm sure 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.960
 you also heard of this poet 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.610
 must have been only twice in the 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.490
 beginning of the season because it is usually 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.229
 a player I do not usually use and 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.060
 how I create for my players to 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.259
 the game against the Bordeaux was what the 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.509
 what are you going to do 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.250
 hit very hard there hitting the iron and 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.439
 then they ended up responding with 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.649
 crossed out to clean the 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.259
 growth of 1 thousand kicks is to make the 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.270
 goal from the equalizer at 45 minutes 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.229
 even at the end of the first part a 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.729
 big move 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.979
 our team could not have done 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.229
 Nothing, so we were not playing. 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.390
 very good maintenance step 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.760
 to jonny crossing to 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.400
 jackson martinez was custodian of making a 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.530
 defense and next tremez 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.659
 The game unfortunately ends up 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.069
 tied a good you now do not 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:21.019
 What matters is that this 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.659
 The man who ran away as stupid as he was 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.790
 ever comes in fifa 3 and remember 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:28.310
 who is in world class and even did 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.379
 It is a matter of showing us and the 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.319
 How stupid this game was? 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:35.840
 Simple we started until we started well 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.549
 Here we set a cap was okay 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.810
 author of the goal I think the ball hit this 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:43.760
 well- blooded player does not 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.269
 matter what matters is if the guard 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.040
 green 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.069
 you will see now in this edition theme 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.579
 that the ball passes even the guarani's viola 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.159
 on thee 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:54.349
 the air and soil to the ball the task of 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:57.349
 to mark in which we are friends of 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:00.109
 God, but it was not only this time that the 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:02.209
 another jackson martinez cross goal 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:05.000
 the ball stopped in a row at eni and then 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.400
 once more the guardian of God who can 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.659
 so for the ball no more no less 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.120
 let the ball in 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:14.599
 and today I do not even know who the 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.120
 to pass because one thing is to hit the ball 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:20.000
 the g12 to trace the trajectory but 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.139
 another and walk there almost stopped and now 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.609
 people do nothing 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:25.699
 today and tomorrow the ball will pass you by 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:27.949
 goalkeeper audit satire do not know if it was 

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:29.720
 save money from ours because I 

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:31.819
 I think this team is not born very good. 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.810
 but even ended up reducing the 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:38.750
 advantage 2 1 11 89 minutes and convincing 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.060
 but it was a very very strange game 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.000
 first because the guard or 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.470
 try to make that stupid figure and 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.810
 afterwards because the ball was always 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.919
 hit a player and our two goals 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.449
 were all were total goals but anyway 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:55.340
 to win the two use what matters is 

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:56.810
 that we get here the three bridges 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.000
 perhaps it was not the fair result 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.829
 but football has these things 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.949
 we are therefore a report from our 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:06.889
 looks and we had the good players here 

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:09.229
 for example we have here the player with 94 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:11.030
 potential of Colombia we have a 

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:11.870
 player who came from the 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.479
 Colombia 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.820
 they were not very good and I think 

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:18.500
 that I did not even have a generator and I think 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.930
 that does not have a Colombian generator in 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.090
 mine is training path are more the 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.919
 other two countries but our series 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.260
 last match for the europe league this is the 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.750
 most important game of this episode 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.250
 Let's rip off in France and this is a 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.620
 team that played against the benfica they 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.360
 have a great advanced diogo fan 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.620
 so our team has increases 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.530
 our defense has to have enough 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.200
 care and we do not even realize the pt avalize 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.520
 As everyone knows, the beto is 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.260
 properly the goal 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.420
 the best goalkeeper internet stop 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.720
 team was at zero with the squad force 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:53.600
 maximum with the euphrates to breathe and 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.610
 extreme that Genentech execution section 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.010
 the remains of athletics tracks 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.320
 We started very well to jackson martínez 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.600
 three minutes to open the scoreboard 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.210
 and will it be that these shoes come back to your 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.980
 Glory I had started the season 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.830
 It was spectacular scoring goal in almost 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.080
 all games because it had 12 to 13 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.240
 and score any goal and that 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.380
 will be back with goal the third 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.330
 minute 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.320
 from the beginning that against the bordeaux but 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.630
 They did not answer 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.880
 The ball hits the post to our team here. 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.010
 a lot of structure and beto ended up 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.010
 hold the danger but they continued to 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.900
 to attack soon after big kill and think 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.030
 a big step for the fan that the 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.640
 neighborhood began earlier this year, which was a 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.860
 very good that nice for doing the 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:40.400
 goal after 41 minutes for the formation 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:42.650
 French our team was not even bad 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.570
 position was but a major step forward. 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.660
 trying to undo the cart 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.640
 to try and make the penalty but 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.970
 We respond very quickly as tomás 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:54.560
 trad bush money this young man is no longer 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.560
 true how to do a career mode here 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:00.170
 in fifa 12 was a machine band so 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.090
 aquino fifa 13 seems to continue and 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.890
 today and tomorrow in the bush with the outside 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.990
 great area so not to give any 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.450
 hypothesis to the goalkeeper and then 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:11.150
 jackson martinez great pass to bill 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:14.230
 fred saha generate assistance here is yours 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:17.540
 team-mate and I'll do your 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:19.190
 goal at 51 minutes bill fred already here 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.290
 has also been in great shape 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.660
 I happen to happen when I hired you. 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.190
 I was not doing much of anything until 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.990
 because even I was not using 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.550
 now have been scoring many goals and 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.070
 has been a very important piece 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:33.980
 for our team but ended up 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:37.070
 reduce the advantage to 73 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:39.380
 minutes by the subject custom chicken the 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:41.120
 spectacular but our team 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.460
 I was winning 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.800
 we are basically dominating the game 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.500
 everyone went two or three times to our 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.090
 and these two times have been 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.100
 resulted in a goal 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:54.610
 and to finish the game we want to have 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:57.080
 sure that the result speaks even 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:59.120
 guaranteeing tomaz braga ended up failing 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.430
 the unfortunately large growth 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.699
 from iron to iron but was not 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:06.380
 This is where the goal came now 

00:07:03.699 --> 00:07:08.870
 big step for jacques martin 

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:11.000
 move and then see your 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:13.760
 Tomas team that makes it the format 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.490
 because the tall feline keeper I 

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:19.970
 I did not give up and insist 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:23.330
 4 to 2 and this yes was the last goal left 

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:25.660
 the 87 minutes very well take two goals 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:30.949
 from jackson martinez a goal and fred a 

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:33.500
 also make the fred aha aha do 

00:07:30.949 --> 00:07:35.360
 a goal the player finished and ended up 

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.100
 finish 42 

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:41.449
 our team manages that the three 

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:43.880
 bridges and unfortunately you already involve him 

00:07:41.449 --> 00:07:45.620
 the malmo also ended up winning the game 

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:48.229
 gave if that means that we 

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:50.240
 we are still fighting for the 

00:07:48.229 --> 00:07:51.260
 first place seven points both 

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.450
 teams 

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.650
 it means that evil has not gained the
