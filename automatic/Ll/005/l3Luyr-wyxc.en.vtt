00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.610
 end of wings of liberty where the 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.500

 a contribution in the deployment experiment 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.020
 money revolution to disinfect the 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.020
 Of gas 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.980
 however sarah is now 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.810
 retained in a secret base where he has 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.090
 been subjected to several experiments 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.280
 having recovered most of his 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.440
 humanity though something will go wrong one 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.600
 of them being forced again to 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:12.460
 reunite their offspring moved by their thirst for 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:16.659
 revenge you have returned with us 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.460
 I am not your queen and I have returned but 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.500
 I need your likely to destroy the 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.909
 frog cannon now regarding the 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.680
 playability of this new delivery 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.659
 keeps all the elements that already 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.220
 we saw in the original game you decided them 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.080
 a real-time strategy title 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.950
 which also has a certain 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:36.190
 rpg component but data me 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.220
 I asked when jce would appear 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:43.790
 we must inform until cures they will send you 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:46.460
 to the great armada videos annihilate the 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.650
 it's a tell me what I 'm taking is not at 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.750
 reach of the dishes for this we have 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.550
 a new campaign with more than 20 new 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.530
 missions being remarkable in the great 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.420
 diversity presented by each of the 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.520
 levels of the game taking on them that 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.770
 meet different objectives or carry 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.979
 accomplished certain tasks getting 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.270
 so never fall into the monotony 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.040
 we will have from escort missions to 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.929
 others where stealth will predominate 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.759
 even phases in which we will have to 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.110
 survive and even some where the 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.000
 time will play against us 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.920
 being able also in many occasions 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 decide in the order in which we want 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.000
 overcome missions 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.420
 check how you can control so many 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.310
 as she the fans of the saga will know 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.500
 the tér are a race with a thought 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.290
 of hive guided by a creature 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.610
 leader being one of its characteristics 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.650
 the great speed with which 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:42.010
 can produce new units and their 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.010
 great capacity is killing the heat 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.000
 in this truth we will find the 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.950
 novelty that assumes the fact that now 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.020
 we can also modify its structure 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.330
 genetics choosing various improvements 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.260
 for each unit adapting the same to 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.260
 our way of playing 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.570
 revolution although I also work the 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.490
 own sara that reagan will have equally 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.230
 a very important role during the 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.850
 missions that that one can also 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.860
 evolve through a tree 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.960
 skills where the player decides what 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.460
 powers you want to assign you can 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.200
 choose from any of 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.570
 learned before starting a mission 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.280
 being this something fundamental throughout 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.170
 of the eye since the weight that will be made in the 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.270
 action will be decisive because of its 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.400
 huge power even more taking in 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.260
 account that if it dies it will not mean 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.900
 the end of the game but it will go back to 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.430
 reborn in our base removed repeating 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.000
 to all the troops in the trench 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:47.120
 retreat we have lost the control that 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.810
 reagan here warfield I know it may sound 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:54.980
 I got a message for you bring everyone 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.180
 its troops brings the whole swarm not 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.390
 I want to have to chase the 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.420
 stragglers after killing you I'll see you in 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.010
 the plateau crisis you old but for 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.200
 supposed if there is something town that has 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.360
 popularized the starcraft saga that about 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.220
 all with its multiplayer side something 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.690
 that has been further strengthened if possible in 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.640
 this new delivery where again 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.120
 we can play with any of the 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.669
 three 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.609
 already classical and the terran tech and 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:21.380
 pro all in this regard we have 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.270
 a matchmaking system that has been 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.190
 renewed with new options besides 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.229
 new scenarios have also been added 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.389
 for the clashes and some 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:31.070
 completely new units for the 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:32.750
 three races of the game what opens the 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.850
 door to new types of strategy 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.360
 being the three sides more balanced 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.360
 never 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.180
 also now we also have 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.890
 other interesting possibilities 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.810
 as the power to watch the repetitions 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.970
 of our games or those of others 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.680
 players and even take control of 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.720
 the same at any time for 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.470
 modify the result or try on them 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.470
 different tactics 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:10.320
 bars everywhere 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.090
 that before we finish we still have 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.800
 talk about the technical section of the title 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.020
 being washed once again the great 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.270
 work done by liza of having 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.900
 polished even more the great attraction that 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:25.610
 already owned the previous wings of liberty 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.610
 wake up annihilate the gorgon 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.810
 we have to make special mention to the 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.699
 impressive quality of the scenes 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.590
 kinematics that will be interspersed to 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:46.180
 throughout the game in addition all 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.490
 will be accompanied as usual 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.530
 for a sensational soundtrack and a 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.419
 great dubbing the Spanish of all 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.550
 the voices what increases the since by 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.350
 yes high cinematographic component 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.510
 that follows the campaign mode which 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:01.380
 will keep us hooked up 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.380
 know its end 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.400
 I do not have to do a shit I will not be a 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.070
 puppet of your prophecies 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.810
 in short starcraft 2 gestures suar 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.090
 it returns to become by own merit 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.010
 in an essential title no longer just 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.540
 for fans of the saga but in general 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.880
 for any fan of games 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.410
 of real- time strategy when dealing with 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.270
 of a game that gives off a great 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:29.130
 quality in all the each of their 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.380
 sections and that thanks to its way 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:34.370
 Multiplayer guarantees us fun by 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.370
 a lot of time 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.389
 now against face to look for 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.070
 negative elements may 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:43.110
 novelties included with respect to 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:46.020
 previous game have not been as many as 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:48.090
 some may have also expected 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.280
 although this new chapter can be played 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:52.380
 independently it turns out much more 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.510
 recommended and almost forced completed 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:56.460
 previously wings of liberty before 

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:58.880
 make the leap to this new expansion if 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:01.650
 we want to be able to better understand your plot 

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.450
 we remind you that it is with running the light 

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:05.070
 of a third chapter focused on the 

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:07.770
 race of the protons with which you 

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:09.960
 will close the ideologies of starcraft 2 if 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:13.080
 when they returned to being human they stopped fearing 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.460
 I have given them new reasons to have 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.779
 fear 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:21.439
 but I will not wait for them to come for me 

00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:21.439
 I will hit first
