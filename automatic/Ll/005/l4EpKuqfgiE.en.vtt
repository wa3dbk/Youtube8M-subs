00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.130
 today the foot chair has a tendency 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.350
 to be more and more known especially 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.210
 since 2000 we played we had the cup of 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.219
 world that took place in paris 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.900
 so it's a discipline that allows 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.530
 people with disabilities 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.960
 to practice a sport that is practiced in 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.529
 three field players and one goalkeeper 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.529
 in electric wheelchairs 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.789
 it is true that today lorient foot 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.780
 chair is leading the championship of 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.600
 France first division 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.840
 I promised to try to do 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.699
 to bring the champion champion of france 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.620
 quite quickly I have the team that my 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:44.620
 notice can fetch this title 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.449
 in 2003 I started at the center of 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.280
 rehabilitation at 49 and then there it is 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.469
 three years that I am in Lorient and 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.300
 and I flourish we are a good little 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:01.400
 group one moves mostly from the 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.860
 France and me it really fucked me 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.680
 commitment and aces 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.530
 to integrate me we'll say to take with 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.150
 my handicap because in quotation marks 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.730
 this is the first outings 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.340
 you are first weekend was 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.110
 we will say you are first of the first 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.230
 where you sleep outside the 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.230
 House 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.080
 the 14th season I was assistant coach 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.840
 before to lorient and then there coach 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.210
 for four years 56 plus too much and that's it 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.170
 what we're doing here on this 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.550
 weekend and this season it 's going to 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.560
 win the title two months that 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.940
 did 14 years that I work for 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.140
 get this title of edf was not 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.180
 isolated after the agreement I had them 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.040
 watched china is so here on this match 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.690
 I 'm going to want them right away 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.410
 in still go it's gone 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.410
 arrived respect 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.960
 we are partners with them but we must 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.160
 follow them also show them 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.700
 is not right there to put them a 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.380
 little money 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.910
 and then hop into view after it's over 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.860
 this time you had everyone 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.630
 what else the effect that parks have not 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.460
 to be a partner I come to see them 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.870
 also play what since I find that 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.160
 one of the commitment he partnership 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.560
 it's not just given a chef it's 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.250
 also follow them all the way to their 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.900
 season and more of what they are super 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.220
 strong because she the precision they 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.260
 we can talk football 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.490
 even our legs can not pull 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.740
 as well as some who pull what 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.300
 it's really athletes apart 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.520
 whole either it's apparently the 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:40.680
 handicap for them it's really not a 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:43.660
 handicap that I like a lot is that at 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.930
 the base people who come to see us 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.480
 play low they watch 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.519
 we will say more more as we say they 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.519
 look like like sports
