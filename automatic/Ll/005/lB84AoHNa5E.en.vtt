awesome<00:03:40.799> looks<00:03:41.799> really<00:03:42.010> plain<00:03:42.310> I<00:03:42.340> think<00:03:42.790> in

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
awesome looks really plain I think in

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.910 
awesome looks really plain I think in
tank<00:03:43.420> mode<00:03:43.659> that<00:03:44.260> looks<00:03:44.439> a<00:03:44.500> lot<00:03:44.590> better<00:03:44.799> in

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
tank mode that looks a lot better in

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.000 
tank mode that looks a lot better in
robot<00:03:45.220> mode<00:03:45.359> just<00:03:46.359> look<00:03:46.510> at<00:03:46.599> that<00:03:46.750> come<00:03:47.620> on<00:03:47.769> I

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
robot mode just look at that come on I

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.369 
robot mode just look at that come on I
think<00:03:48.579> that<00:03:48.910> silver<00:03:49.480> I<00:03:49.629> think<00:03:49.959> they<00:03:50.230> would

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:50.379 
think that silver I think they would

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:51.720 
think that silver I think they would
have<00:03:50.440> added<00:03:50.620> a<00:03:50.769> bunch<00:03:50.949> of<00:03:51.040> silver<00:03:51.370> maybe<00:03:51.549> on

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
have added a bunch of silver maybe on

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.409 
have added a bunch of silver maybe on
the<00:03:51.849> barrel<00:03:52.180> or<00:03:52.480> some<00:03:53.410> detailing<00:03:54.190> on<00:03:54.280> here<00:03:54.730> and

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:55.419 
the barrel or some detailing on here and

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:56.909 
the barrel or some detailing on here and
some<00:03:55.780> yellow<00:03:56.079> in<00:03:56.230> there<00:03:56.379> I<00:03:56.410> think<00:03:56.590> it<00:03:56.829> would

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:56.919 
some yellow in there I think it would

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:00.449 
some yellow in there I think it would
look<00:03:56.949> a<00:03:57.310> lot<00:03:57.579> better<00:03:58.680> very<00:03:59.680> plain<00:03:59.980> but<00:04:00.159> still

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
look a lot better very plain but still

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.899 
look a lot better very plain but still
the<00:04:00.549> great<00:04:00.760> mold<00:04:01.769> does<00:04:02.769> have<00:04:02.949> four<00:04:03.519> wheels<00:04:03.760> on

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:03.909 
the great mold does have four wheels on

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:06.899 
the great mold does have four wheels on
the<00:04:03.970> bottom<00:04:04.090> roll<00:04:04.810> and<00:04:05.680> you<00:04:06.459> make<00:04:06.609> you<00:04:06.699> see<00:04:06.849> all

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:06.909 
the bottom roll and you make you see all

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:09.930 
the bottom roll and you make you see all
the<00:04:07.030> robots<00:04:07.389> head<00:04:07.840> and<00:04:08.159> chest<00:04:09.159> piece<00:04:09.459> but<00:04:09.699> what
