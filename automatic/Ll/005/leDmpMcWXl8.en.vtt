00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.400
 palace sneaker rock glue and today we 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.719
 talk again about basketball shoes 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.000
 true it will not be so 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.120
 thematic program like last time 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.980
 but she, too, will be interested in how I no longer 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.539
 once told there is a big 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.240
 number of sneaker models 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.529
 which are released and timed somehow 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.359
 certain events 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.050
 chrismas and about which we spoke recently 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.179
 black history monk or for example pastor 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.710
 Easter is a very important holy day 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.809
 probably in all catholic europe and in 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.260
 America and one of the required attributes 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.899
 Easter is Easter eggs most often 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.030
 chocolate that parents hide in the morning 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.370
 around the garden and there throughout the apartment and 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.710
 children are looking for them and are happy 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.800
 These eggs are necessarily bright beautiful 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.739
 so that you can immediately notice and 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.500
 There is a tradition for Easter to produce 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.329
 insanely bright beautiful sneakers like 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.890
 classic model rule 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:07.380
 but in a very bright rainbow good stifling 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.840
 flourishing, respectively, so it was in this 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.470
 year and we for example saw such 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.810
 wonderful easter lebron and 10 well 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.490
 what are they interested in first is low 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.790
 silhouette before we talked only 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.710
 high tenths lebrons a estar and 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.430
 Deshego not afraid of the word appeared 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.130
 so low 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.580
 low silhouette is basically the same 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.640
 what we talked about high lebron it and 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:39.110
 air cushion and flywire threads 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.200
 and aggressive powerful silhouette but low and 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.280
 Here are these crazy colors here 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.910

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.650
 this row sneakers Carmelo Anthony 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.619
 sometimes it’s no elite 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.750
 they call besides the name of the crosses 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.000
 there is also the second name poison green and 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.580
 the fact is that the fed effect is not on 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.160
 past paska distinguished by the fact that he went to 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.410
 court can say absolutely normal 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.750

 this year , these are sneakers right away 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.850

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.610
 turned out to be interesting immediately say this 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.750
 that it is not very original 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.299
