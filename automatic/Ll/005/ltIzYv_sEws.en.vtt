00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.870
 When will it be fast? 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.400
 This is it, you see here that I 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.930
 I'll try to stay alone but not have to pay 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.479

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.450
 Today I'm going to teach you how to leave. 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.220
 He fast I said 300 times is not got 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.490
 much strengthened because that 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.530
 Ball was a good one, I'm here. 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:29.630
 with a 1-ghz single core processor is 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.630
 has 1 GB of ram is wrong 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.909
 here I think 761 else I'll say one 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.729
 thing I know 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.890
 so let's go back here to let it be 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.670
 You still look like you are 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.670
 seeing here 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.030
 it's even an animated wallpaper that I 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.909
 I did it for you. 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.310
 that even an animated chat is not 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.509
 however, the people we go to 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.939
 interest 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.729
 So let's go and stay here at 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:04.869
 invisible left button 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.649
 we got in settings and went down there 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.289
 down 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:12.459
 I'll see that the so-called option 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:15.090
 developer sony promises to tinker 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:21.090
 Night will go down until I was 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:26.530
 down the stairs window animation 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.489
 is in 2x will leave in animation is 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.769
 off 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:34.269
 we won on top and bottom left 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.299
 off 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.250
 this option here will O's here and vacancies 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:42.069
 off on why it is that she will 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:46.840
 leave your back to work on the 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:50.920
 but also did not expect to say 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:54.400
 so let's activate this one 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.620
 to be able to stay faster 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.239
 to imitate processes in the background 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.580
 we leave here as a process in the 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.819
 maximum and only this 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.640
 Just the same, who's going to make the phone? 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:09.069
 stay like this and here 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:24.640
 something else also ensures that the 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:34.709
 this little button that has an example 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:38.860
 record the message open messages ok 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:43.420
 How old are you? 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:45.280
 So I wrote this button and it's safe and 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.799
 because it involves all this here too 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.840
 It will leave there only very fast and also 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:54.670
 something else is going to start a battery 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:58.930
 nothing then galera valeu is liking there 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.769
 the video was only quick to warn of this 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.180
 stayed 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:10.120
 I also warned you more because I'm 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:13.420
 He won the thigh so it's a 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.040
 leaving you guys, you can rest easy. 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.049
 that will work right are seeing 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.220
 here is proof that the phone is 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.459
 fast 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:25.830
 're doing things well open the same 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.830
 table are not paid spoke
