hello and welcome to my intel quad core
i7<00:00:02.790> 2670<00:00:04.009> and<00:00:05.009> review<00:00:05.370> this<00:00:06.000> is<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.420> processor

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
i7 2670 and review this is the processor

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.160 
i7 2670 and review this is the processor
I<00:00:07.080> got<00:00:07.319> at<00:00:07.560> a<00:00:08.309> computer<00:00:08.700> shop<00:00:08.880> I'm<00:00:09.809> not<00:00:10.019> sure

manual it tells you stuff about the
processor

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:47.830 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.050 

yeah<00:00:48.830> sorry<00:00:49.010> that<00:00:49.220> was<00:00:49.310> a<00:00:49.370> bit<00:00:49.489> racist<00:00:49.670> affably

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
cut that out anyway here is the heatsink

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.299 
cut that out anyway here is the heatsink
for<00:00:52.220> the<00:00:52.370> Sabbath<00:00:52.910> on<00:00:53.059> and<00:00:53.360> um<00:00:53.660> and<00:00:54.070> stuff<00:00:55.070> and

for the Sabbath on and um and stuff and
I<00:00:55.489> couldn't<00:00:55.730> find<00:00:55.910> the<00:00:56.030> process<00:00:56.420> I<00:00:56.510> didn't

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
I couldn't find the process I didn't

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.330 
I couldn't find the process I didn't
know<00:00:56.870> where<00:00:57.050> it<00:00:57.080> was<00:00:57.200> and<00:00:57.650> then<00:00:57.980> I<00:00:58.130> finally

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
know where it was and then I finally

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.710 
know where it was and then I finally
found<00:00:58.550> it<00:00:58.700> in<00:00:58.790> the<00:00:58.820> box<00:00:59.059> on<00:00:59.210> my<00:00:59.270> cameraman

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
found it in the box on my cameraman

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.869 
found it in the box on my cameraman
pointed<00:01:00.140> it<00:01:00.230> out<00:01:00.350> and<00:01:00.710> there's<00:01:01.460> the<00:01:01.550> process

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
pointed it out and there's the process

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:03.910 
pointed it out and there's the process
say<00:01:02.030> it<00:01:02.180> is<00:01:02.330> a<00:01:02.480> quad<00:01:02.780> core<00:01:03.020> which<00:01:03.379> if<00:01:03.680> you<00:01:03.800> know

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
say it is a quad core which if you know

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.260 
say it is a quad core which if you know
anything<00:01:04.129> about<00:01:04.309> processes<00:01:04.910> you<00:01:05.030> probably

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
anything about processes you probably

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.950 
anything about processes you probably
know<00:01:05.420> that<00:01:05.780> about<00:01:05.960> the<00:01:06.200> i7<00:01:06.650> and<00:01:06.830> um<00:01:07.960> yeah

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
know that about the i7 and um yeah

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.650 
know that about the i7 and um yeah
that's<00:01:09.229> pretty<00:01:09.710> much<00:01:09.860> it<00:01:10.010> about<00:01:10.430> that<00:01:10.610> he<00:01:11.600> is

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
that's pretty much it about that he is

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.510 
that's pretty much it about that he is
me<00:01:11.869> putting<00:01:12.080> it<00:01:12.320> in<00:01:12.470> I<00:01:12.650> sped<00:01:12.979> it<00:01:13.070> up<00:01:13.160> because<00:01:13.310> it

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
me putting it in I sped it up because it

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.109 
me putting it in I sped it up because it
took<00:01:13.640> him<00:01:13.790> to<00:01:13.970> a<00:01:14.000> bit<00:01:14.150> of<00:01:14.270> time<00:01:15.610> so<00:01:16.610> that's<00:01:17.000> the

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
took him to a bit of time so that's the

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:18.810 
took him to a bit of time so that's the
cover<00:01:17.450> that<00:01:17.690> was<00:01:17.810> over<00:01:18.020> the<00:01:18.050> motherboard<00:01:18.560> I

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
cover that was over the motherboard I

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.920 
cover that was over the motherboard I
don't<00:01:19.820> know<00:01:19.940> what<00:01:20.030> it<00:01:20.180> says<00:01:20.360> please<00:01:20.540> that<00:01:20.810> was

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
don't know what it says please that was

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.900 
don't know what it says please that was
too<00:01:21.080> fast<00:01:21.229> for<00:01:21.410> me<00:01:21.860> to<00:01:21.979> read<00:01:22.100> so<00:01:22.399> it<00:01:22.580> doesn't

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
too fast for me to read so it doesn't

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.060 
too fast for me to read so it doesn't
matter<00:01:23.030> I'm<00:01:23.330> there<00:01:24.170> that's<00:01:24.410> putting<00:01:24.800> it<00:01:24.860> in

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
matter I'm there that's putting it in

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.790 
matter I'm there that's putting it in
and<00:01:25.310> then<00:01:25.880> close<00:01:26.869> the<00:01:26.990> cover<00:01:27.170> over<00:01:27.380> it<00:01:27.530> and

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
and then close the cover over it and

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.430 
and then close the cover over it and
then<00:01:28.009> holy<00:01:28.270> lock<00:01:29.270> it<00:01:29.420> in<00:01:29.570> so<00:01:29.810> it<00:01:29.930> doesn't<00:01:30.110> spook

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
then holy lock it in so it doesn't spook

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.999 
then holy lock it in so it doesn't spook
and<00:01:31.810> then<00:01:32.810> put<00:01:33.020> an<00:01:33.259> hour<00:01:33.470> east<00:01:33.710> of<00:01:33.890> the

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
and then put an hour east of the

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.430 
and then put an hour east of the
heatsink<00:01:34.399> and<00:01:34.660> after<00:01:35.660> I<00:01:35.690> push<00:01:35.990> down<00:01:36.200> all<00:01:36.350> the

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
heatsink and after I push down all the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.930 
heatsink and after I push down all the
things<00:01:36.680> i<00:01:36.920> can<00:01:37.130> plug<00:01:37.340> the<00:01:37.520> pan<00:01:37.700> into<00:01:37.910> the

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
things i can plug the pan into the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.359 
things i can plug the pan into the
motherboard<00:01:38.240> and<00:01:38.690> then<00:01:39.070> they<00:01:40.070> know<00:01:40.160> probably

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
motherboard and then they know probably

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:41.620 
motherboard and then they know probably
needed<00:01:40.729> a<00:01:40.759> little<00:01:40.910> bit<00:01:41.119> of<00:01:41.149> more<00:01:41.420> power

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
needed a little bit of more power

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.290 
needed a little bit of more power
because<00:01:42.369> when<00:01:43.369> i<00:01:43.399> first<00:01:43.670> had<00:01:43.789> to<00:01:43.820> turn<00:01:44.060> on

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
because when i first had to turn on

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.580 
because when i first had to turn on
everything<00:01:44.690> to<00:01:44.840> span<00:01:45.140> and<00:01:45.289> then<00:01:45.440> nothing

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
everything to span and then nothing

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.219 
everything to span and then nothing
happened<00:01:46.390> so<00:01:47.390> there's<00:01:47.600> turning<00:01:47.900> it<00:01:47.990> on<00:01:48.049> for

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
happened so there's turning it on for

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.770 
happened so there's turning it on for
the<00:01:48.290> first<00:01:48.409> time<00:01:48.650> it<00:01:49.010> over<00:01:49.310> and<00:01:49.700> if<00:01:50.510> you<00:01:50.600> look

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
the first time it over and if you look

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.330 
the first time it over and if you look
at<00:01:50.900> my<00:01:51.020> fingers<00:01:51.380> I'm<00:01:51.530> pressing<00:01:51.799> delete<00:01:51.920> really

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
at my fingers I'm pressing delete really

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.340 
at my fingers I'm pressing delete really
fast<00:01:52.580> because<00:01:53.090> I<00:01:53.330> have<00:01:53.659> to<00:01:53.689> speed<00:01:53.960> it<00:01:54.080> up<00:01:54.170> and

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
fast because I have to speed it up and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.340 
fast because I have to speed it up and
get<00:01:54.470> into<00:01:54.710> into<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.430> bios<00:01:55.700> to<00:01:56.020> choose<00:01:57.020> it<00:01:57.200> so

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
get into into the bios to choose it so

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.780 
get into into the bios to choose it so
that<00:01:57.500> it<00:01:57.619> pulls<00:01:57.770> from<00:01:57.890> the<00:01:58.100> CD<00:01:58.369> because<00:01:58.520> I<00:01:58.610> have

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
that it pulls from the CD because I have

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.990 
that it pulls from the CD because I have
to<00:01:58.820> install<00:01:59.299> on<00:01:59.360> windows<00:01:59.810> 7<00:02:03.759> there<00:02:04.759> is<00:02:04.850> the

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.149 
to install on windows 7 there is the
computer<00:02:05.420> restarting<00:02:06.020> I<00:02:06.170> mean<00:02:06.860> I'm<00:02:06.979> not

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
computer restarting I mean I'm not

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.740

retracting<00:02:07.640> booting<00:02:08.000> as<00:02:08.269> you<00:02:08.390> can<00:02:08.509> see<00:02:08.630> it

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
retracting booting as you can see it

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.199 
retracting booting as you can see it
says<00:02:08.929> windows<00:02:09.170> is<00:02:09.530> loading<00:02:09.560> files<00:02:10.060> so<00:02:11.060> then

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
says windows is loading files so then

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.600 
says windows is loading files so then
once<00:02:11.360> that<00:02:11.480> is<00:02:11.690> done<00:02:11.720> it<00:02:12.620> will<00:02:12.950> arm<00:02:13.250> install

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
once that is done it will arm install

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.729 
once that is done it will arm install
windows<00:02:13.910> and<00:02:14.150> then<00:02:14.750> we<00:02:15.079> would<00:02:15.290> have<00:02:15.440> a<00:02:15.470> full

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
windows and then we would have a full

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.819 
windows and then we would have a full
operating<00:02:16.070> system<00:02:16.519> and<00:02:17.260> then<00:02:18.260> I'm<00:02:18.380> putting<00:02:18.709> on

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:18.829 
operating system and then I'm putting on

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.699 
operating system and then I'm putting on
the<00:02:19.579> sticker<00:02:20.090> that<00:02:20.209> says<00:02:20.450> I'm<00:02:20.660> intel<00:02:21.140> core<00:02:21.530> i7

the sticker that says I'm intel core i7

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.990 
the sticker that says I'm intel core i7

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.580 
and there we go it is now starting
windows<00:02:28.730> so<00:02:28.970> you<00:02:29.000> can<00:02:29.420> see<00:02:29.630> that<00:02:29.660> we<00:02:30.230> have<00:02:30.260> a

full working operating system on a
brand-new<00:02:32.810> computer<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:34.450> this<00:02:35.450> is<00:02:35.630> just<00:02:35.750> the

through so you don't have to wait for
everything

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880

actually<00:02:55.730> bled<00:02:56.120> it<00:02:56.240> out<00:02:56.390> so<00:02:56.660> you<00:02:56.720> don't<00:02:56.840> find

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
actually bled it out so you don't find

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.250 
actually bled it out so you don't find
my<00:02:57.890> computer<00:02:58.400> and<00:02:58.610> because<00:02:59.510> if<00:02:59.720> you<00:02:59.840> do<00:03:00.050> that

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
my computer and because if you do that

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.840 
my computer and because if you do that
would<00:03:00.440> be<00:03:00.560> bad<00:03:00.740> and<00:03:00.980> my<00:03:01.100> password<00:03:01.340> as<00:03:01.670> well

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
would be bad and my password as well

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.160 
would be bad and my password as well
because<00:03:02.090> i<00:03:02.150> use<00:03:02.300> my<00:03:02.450> password<00:03:02.840> but<00:03:03.020> quite<00:03:03.140> a

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
because i use my password but quite a

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.030 
because i use my password but quite a
lot<00:03:03.380> of<00:03:03.500> things<00:03:03.680> so<00:03:04.010> yeah<00:03:05.080> and<00:03:06.080> then<00:03:06.530> use<00:03:06.890> the

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
lot of things so yeah and then use the

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.800 
lot of things so yeah and then use the
firewall<00:03:07.460> the<00:03:07.670> automatic<00:03:08.090> firewall<00:03:08.450> settings

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
firewall the automatic firewall settings

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.900 
firewall the automatic firewall settings
so<00:03:09.170> we<00:03:09.290> can<00:03:09.440> load<00:03:09.620> up<00:03:09.800> and<00:03:10.010> then<00:03:10.250> we<00:03:10.490> can<00:03:10.670> have<00:03:10.850> a

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
so we can load up and then we can have a

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.170 
so we can load up and then we can have a
fully<00:03:11.300> working<00:03:11.540> computer<00:03:12.670> when<00:03:13.670> it<00:03:13.790> loads<00:03:13.940> up

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
fully working computer when it loads up

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.270 
fully working computer when it loads up
you'll<00:03:14.360> see<00:03:14.570> that<00:03:14.750> windows<00:03:15.530> actually<00:03:15.830> looks<00:03:16.160> a

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
you'll see that windows actually looks a
