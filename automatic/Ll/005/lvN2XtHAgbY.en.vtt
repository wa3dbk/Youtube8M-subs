00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
he's down basically a Holbrook is that

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:07.590 
he's down basically a Holbrook is that
right<00:03:01.620> yeah<00:03:02.620> something<00:03:02.920> like<00:03:02.950> that<00:03:06.510> here<00:03:07.510> we

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
right yeah something like that here we

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.690 
right yeah something like that here we
go<00:03:07.690> since<00:03:07.930> I'm<00:03:08.020> already<00:03:08.170> a<00:03:08.490> material<00:03:09.490> i<00:03:09.520> want

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
go since I'm already a material i want

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.010 
go since I'm already a material i want
to<00:03:09.760> start<00:03:09.880> trading<00:03:10.150> down<00:03:10.300> material<00:03:10.720> quickly

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
to start trading down material quickly

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:17.490 
to start trading down material quickly
and<00:03:11.230> i<00:03:11.770> win<00:03:11.950> with<00:03:12.040> my<00:03:12.160> rooks<00:03:15.090> so<00:03:16.090> he<00:03:16.350> checks<00:03:17.350> me

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
and i win with my rooks so he checks me

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.640 
and i win with my rooks so he checks me
first<00:03:17.770> and<00:03:18.810> then<00:03:19.810> decides<00:03:20.140> to<00:03:20.290> defend<00:03:20.560> this

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
first and then decides to defend this

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.780 
first and then decides to defend this
night<00:03:20.890> now<00:03:21.130> i<00:03:21.190> could<00:03:21.280> just<00:03:21.400> take<00:03:21.550> the<00:03:21.580> night

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
night now i could just take the night

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.010 
night now i could just take the night
right<00:03:21.940> away<00:03:22.590> I<00:03:24.600> realized<00:03:25.600> later<00:03:25.960> that

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
right away I realized later that

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.210 
right away I realized later that
probably<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:26.500> best<00:03:26.650> move<00:03:26.860> would<00:03:26.980> have<00:03:27.100> been

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
probably the best move would have been

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.840 
probably the best move would have been
to<00:03:27.880> bring<00:03:28.030> my<00:03:28.150> rope<00:03:28.330> over<00:03:28.600> but<00:03:29.500> uh<00:03:29.670> decided<00:03:30.670> to

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
to bring my rope over but uh decided to

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.040 
to bring my rope over but uh decided to
hop<00:03:30.940> my<00:03:31.030> knight<00:03:31.180> in<00:03:31.210> first<00:03:31.600> I<00:03:31.750> could<00:03:31.870> take<00:03:31.990> the

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
hop my knight in first I could take the

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.350 
hop my knight in first I could take the
material<00:03:32.410> whenever<00:03:32.620> I<00:03:32.680> want<00:03:33.060> as<00:03:34.060> soon<00:03:34.210> as<00:03:34.300> he

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
material whenever I want as soon as he

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.930 
material whenever I want as soon as he
breaks<00:03:34.480> the<00:03:34.690> pan<00:03:34.900> I<00:03:35.400> went<00:03:36.400> ahead<00:03:36.460> just<00:03:36.760> took<00:03:36.880> it

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
breaks the pan I went ahead just took it

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:44.370 
breaks the pan I went ahead just took it
and<00:03:37.180> then<00:03:37.870> initiate<00:03:38.290> a<00:03:38.320> trade<00:03:43.170> so<00:03:44.170> here<00:03:44.350> my

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
and then initiate a trade so here my

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.930 
and then initiate a trade so here my
whole<00:03:44.890> game<00:03:45.040> plan<00:03:45.160> at<00:03:45.310> this<00:03:45.400> point<00:03:45.490> basically

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
whole game plan at this point basically

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.370 
whole game plan at this point basically
since<00:03:46.210> I'm<00:03:46.330> up<00:03:46.420> so<00:03:46.540> much<00:03:46.630> material<00:03:46.780> is<00:03:47.170> just

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
since I'm up so much material is just

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.920 
since I'm up so much material is just
trade<00:03:47.620> down<00:03:47.800> material<00:03:48.730> and<00:03:48.880> get<00:03:49.600> to<00:03:49.720> an<00:03:49.810> end

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
trade down material and get to an end

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.330 
trade down material and get to an end
game<00:03:50.050> and<00:03:50.320> I<00:03:50.470> cannot<00:03:50.710> know<00:03:50.860> I<00:03:50.890> can<00:03:51.010> win<00:03:51.070> an<00:03:51.220> end

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
game and I cannot know I can win an end

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.570 
game and I cannot know I can win an end
game<00:03:51.460> when<00:03:51.610> I'm<00:03:51.730> up<00:03:51.970> roken<00:03:52.750> or<00:03:53.080> an<00:03:54.040> exchange<00:03:54.430> in

and<00:05:44.580> the<00:05:44.819> rook<00:05:45.029> is<00:05:45.240> a<00:05:45.270> lot<00:05:45.479> stronger<00:05:45.690> than<00:05:45.870> a

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
and the rook is a lot stronger than a

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.399 
and the rook is a lot stronger than a
bishop<00:05:47.779> so<00:05:48.779> I'm<00:05:48.870> gonna<00:05:48.960> be<00:05:49.050> looking<00:05:49.259> pretty

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:49.409 
bishop so I'm gonna be looking pretty

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:50.719 
bishop so I'm gonna be looking pretty
good<00:05:49.529> here<00:05:49.770> so<00:05:49.949> I<00:05:50.009> go<00:05:50.310> ahead<00:05:50.370> and<00:05:50.460> push<00:05:50.610> his

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
good here so I go ahead and push his

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.309 
good here so I go ahead and push his
Bishop<00:05:51.000> away<00:05:51.210> and<00:05:51.479> start<00:05:51.779> advancing<00:05:52.169> my<00:05:52.289> pawns

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:54.319 
Bishop away and start advancing my pawns

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:56.209 
Bishop away and start advancing my pawns
this<00:05:55.319> was<00:05:55.440> a<00:05:55.529> good<00:05:55.620> move<00:05:55.800> right<00:05:55.949> here<00:05:56.039> with

00:05:56.209 --> 00:05:56.219

this pond just to cut him off from being

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.480 
this pond just to cut him off from being
able<00:05:57.840> to<00:05:57.960> approach<00:05:58.229> these<00:05:58.440> pawns<00:05:58.710> through<00:05:59.400> the

able to approach these pawns through the
middle<00:05:59.759> this<00:06:00.569> pawns<00:06:00.840> got<00:06:01.080> a<00:06:01.110> straight<00:06:02.099> shot

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
middle this pawns got a straight shot

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.010 
middle this pawns got a straight shot
all<00:06:02.430> the<00:06:02.520> way<00:06:02.580> to<00:06:02.639> the<00:06:02.759> end<00:06:02.880> now<00:06:03.060> if<00:06:03.659> you<00:06:03.840> notice

um<00:06:04.440> I<00:06:05.090> thought<00:06:06.090> I<00:06:06.120> move<00:06:06.300> it<00:06:06.389> out<00:06:06.479> of<00:06:06.509> the<00:06:06.569> way<00:06:06.690> he

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
um I thought I move it out of the way he

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.180 
um I thought I move it out of the way he
can't<00:06:07.110> come<00:06:07.229> up<00:06:07.380> here<00:06:07.560> to<00:06:07.620> keep<00:06:07.830> it<00:06:08.039> from

can't come up here to keep it from
hitting<00:06:08.340> this<00:06:08.550> square<00:06:08.819> cuz<00:06:09.029> my<00:06:09.150> rook<00:06:09.330> can<00:06:09.360> take

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
hitting this square cuz my rook can take

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.140 
hitting this square cuz my rook can take
it<00:06:10.130> he<00:06:11.130> can't<00:06:11.340> move<00:06:11.430> his<00:06:11.490> pawn<00:06:11.729> out<00:06:11.909> of<00:06:12.000> the<00:06:12.060> way

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150
