I'll switch all the rods over to that no
I've<00:03:39.950> got<00:03:40.130> two<00:03:40.340> already<00:03:40.460> on<00:03:40.820> secret<00:03:41.180> seven<00:03:41.420> and

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
I've got two already on secret seven and

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.690 
I've got two already on secret seven and
have<00:03:41.840> only<00:03:41.960> been<00:03:42.230> here<00:03:42.290> for<00:03:42.650> I<00:03:42.860> don't<00:03:43.550> even

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
have only been here for I don't even

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.610 
have only been here for I don't even
think<00:03:43.970> it's<00:03:44.090> been<00:03:44.270> 15<00:03:44.660> months<00:03:44.960> to<00:03:45.080> say<00:03:45.290> 20

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
think it's been 15 months to say 20

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.890 
think it's been 15 months to say 20
minutes<00:03:45.950> so<00:03:46.700> what<00:03:46.940> I<00:03:46.970> should<00:03:47.300> be<00:03:47.450> doing<00:03:47.480> is

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
minutes so what I should be doing is

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.780 
minutes so what I should be doing is
moving<00:03:48.050> the<00:03:48.380> sudden<00:03:48.710> impact<00:03:49.040> to<00:03:49.280> a<00:03:49.310> secret

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
moving the sudden impact to a secret

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.760 
moving the sudden impact to a secret
seven<00:03:49.970> bait<00:03:50.240> and<00:03:50.720> that's<00:03:50.900> typically<00:03:51.380> how<00:03:51.500> it

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
seven bait and that's typically how it

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.440 
seven bait and that's typically how it
works<00:03:51.980> there's<00:03:52.310> some<00:03:52.520> days<00:03:52.700> where<00:03:52.970> cut<00:03:53.240> bait

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
works there's some days where cut bait

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.570 
works there's some days where cut bait
works<00:03:53.690> much<00:03:54.080> better<00:03:54.110> than<00:03:54.470> stink<00:03:55.430> bait

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
works much better than stink bait

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.510 
works much better than stink bait
there's<00:03:56.180> other<00:03:56.360> days<00:03:56.570> that<00:03:57.340> secret<00:03:58.340> seven

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520 
there's other days that secret seven

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.460 
there's other days that secret seven
works<00:03:58.820> better<00:03:59.060> than<00:03:59.300> sudden<00:03:59.630> sudden<00:04:00.140> impact

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
works better than sudden sudden impact

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.580 
works better than sudden sudden impact
and<00:04:00.770> don't<00:04:01.520> ask<00:04:01.700> me<00:04:01.910> why<00:04:02.060> because<00:04:02.330> it<00:04:02.720> reverses

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
and don't ask me why because it reverses

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.100 
and don't ask me why because it reverses
sometimes<00:04:04.070> too<00:04:04.340> so<00:04:05.180> by<00:04:05.360> having<00:04:05.480> both<00:04:05.840> baits

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
sometimes too so by having both baits

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.080 
sometimes too so by having both baits
out<00:04:06.350> here<00:04:06.590> you<00:04:06.860> can<00:04:07.010> let<00:04:07.400> the<00:04:07.550> fish<00:04:07.730> tell<00:04:07.760> you
