00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.890
 hello to all I am I garzon and 278 today tells you a credit 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.410
 until I found myself in a video game forum a few years ago 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.150
 they closed off from macorís tikrit where a final user called then commented a 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.670
 Unpleasant experience that happened to you with a game of luigi's 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.650
 mansion that he bought from a friend of his dad who had just lost his son in 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:22.380
 an accident 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.820
 and he was selling all his belongings to get rid of his 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.359
 memories the rapporteurs of the way the user described it 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.739
 I remember that day with so much fear that just remembering it gives me the creeps 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.830
 it was October if I'm not wrong the son of my dad's friend had just 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.010
 dying the neighborhood looked something strange and something was perceived out of the 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.750
 normal 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.600
 one day after the funeral of their parents I tell them to sell all their 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.510
 belongings I am curious I went to see I did not feel any sadness since the shot 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.290
 He talked a lot to the boy because he was a little quiet and did not socialize much 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.770
 while searching between the sale and a box with some games 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.040
 among them there were some executives 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.900
 I was glad when I was looking into it since I found one of my favorite games 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.850
 although the box was a little badly treated and the disc was almost 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.430
 unpainted 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.610
 mind I did not have one more mistake and that they should buy us quickly I ran 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.160
 to my house to play it 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.040
 excited connect michelín giubi without thinking I put the game 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.990
 when I turned on the console something strange happened because it did not appear and 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.950
 came normal from the crowd logo if not immediately directed me to the 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.570
 game start screen 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.259
 I did not take much 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.500
 and then I started playing 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.560
 the game started normal luigi walking on a bus to have them or 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.460
 going to his new mansion 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.870
 it was strange to me the detail of the blood in the mansion as nintendo 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.270
 I would never do that at the moment of entering there to begin with the game my command 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.090
 it started to vibrate I thought I was failing or something like that so 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.020
 I continued to play 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.899
 after about 30 minutes the control would not stop vibrating so I decided 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.220
 disable the option but still did not stop doing it 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.220
 I connected a second command and apparently stopped doing it 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.439
 after a whole afternoon without stopping to play I felt a little tired like that 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:14.449
 who decided to turn off the console 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:18.129
 when I wanted to pay the payroll and started screaming a name that was not 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:18.949
 the marble 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:22.219
 decide to wait for him to stop doing it but he did not stop 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:25.980
 I tried to listen to what seems to be the name of the old 

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:30.129
 deceased owner of the game at that time panicked and terrified 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.709
 turn off the console mysteriously willy scream in a scary way before 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:35.959
 I turned it off 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.950
 I was shocked I thought that maybe it was just a ship the game to be 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.150
 so mistreated and confused the words because of the fear he felt 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.020
 I decided to rest and I lay in my bed to sleep a little 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.060
 I do not know how much time passed but it was around 4 in the morning a 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.720
 intense brightness woke me up and when I opened my eyes I realized that the production 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.709
 I was on I do not know how or when 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.449
 I ran to see what was happening and on the screen was the luigi's game 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:03.229
 Mansion 

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:07.549
 in it they observed mini sitting on the floor crying in a little way 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:12.119
 twisted and macabre muttering some things in another language take command and 

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:15.959
 I tried to move him but he did not respond until he got up and the camera 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.049
 he focused his face 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.199
 in it you could see the face of a psychopath and not that of a character of a 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.959
 videogame 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.989
 I was very confused and I did not know what to do the fear began to invade my 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.149
 body while this character laughed at me in a sickly way I could not 

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:34.389
 even move to turn off the television a console 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:37.619
 Suddenly Luis started to run without them moving a finger 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:42.200
 He went to a room a room that seemed outside the theme of the game 

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:44.619
 set in the real world 

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:48.529
 It showed the body of a young man lying bloody and mutilated. 

00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:52.389
 Suddenly, he noticed at the beginning, since sometime in my life I entered the young man's room 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:53.889
 passed away 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:57.049
 at a party or meeting and recognized that it was his 

00:03:57.649 --> 00:04:00.790
 I could not believe I was seeing the way he died 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.720
 I do not know how I did it but reactions and quickly unplug the console and 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:05.550
 keep everything 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.550
 days after what happened decided to get rid of the game that obviously 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.440
 I was possessed by the soul of the young man I believe had not really died in a 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.130
 traffic accident that had been mutilated by someone someone who was 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.019
 represented by luigi in the game 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.110
 what next to a river that was close to the neighborhood and welcomes the ashes 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.960
 the water 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.949
 I do not know if I did the right thing but from that day on it has never happened again 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:30.379
 nothing strange 

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:34.089
 it just remained that horrible memory of that game with an innocent soul 

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:35.490
 trapped in berlin 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.979
 months later the police arrested the parents of the murdered youth 

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:43.809
 well this has been everything I hope you like it I have not invented anything what 

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:47.490
 I found in a forum some time ago and I saved it to share it with 

00:04:47.489 --> 00:04:51.669
 you will be uploading videos of this type so when you find another 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.909
 interesting story on the internet and there will be until the next
