00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
because i start at zero so i just made

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.740 
because i start at zero so i just made
it<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.239> big<00:00:48.360> number<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.649> gives<00:00:49.829> them<00:00:49.980> all

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
it a big number so it gives them all

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.840 
it a big number so it gives them all
different<00:00:51.750> numbers<00:00:52.020> right<00:00:52.590> based<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.670> which

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
different numbers right based on which

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.299 
different numbers right based on which
one<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.059> encounter<00:00:54.510> first<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.920> if<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.160> hold

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
I take a bit of explaining and hopefully

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.630 
I take a bit of explaining and hopefully
I'm<00:02:18.410> not<00:02:18.500> too<00:02:18.620> confusing<00:02:19.010> comment<00:02:19.490> if<00:02:19.550> you

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
I'm not too confusing comment if you

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.060 
I'm not too confusing comment if you
have<00:02:19.670> any<00:02:19.760> questions<00:02:20.180> once<00:02:20.450> i'm<00:02:20.600> done<00:02:20.630> and

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
have any questions once i'm done and

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.130 
have any questions once i'm done and
let's<00:02:22.070> get<00:02:22.430> into<00:02:22.610> it<00:02:22.790> so<00:02:23.120> first<00:02:23.450> let's<00:02:23.870> just<00:02:24.050> do

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
let's get into it so first let's just do

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.270 
let's get into it so first let's just do
the<00:02:24.260> characters<00:02:24.440> brain<00:02:24.860> are<00:02:25.100> I<00:02:25.160> guy<00:02:25.490> and<00:02:27.280> okay

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
the characters brain are I guy and okay

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.410 
the characters brain are I guy and okay
here<00:02:28.490> we<00:02:28.550> go<00:02:28.580> so<00:02:28.820> when<00:02:29.000> you're<00:02:29.120> holding<00:02:29.390> down

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
here we go so when you're holding down

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.900 
here we go so when you're holding down
shift<00:02:29.830> that's<00:02:30.830> why<00:02:31.070> it's<00:02:31.190> indented<00:02:31.430> so<00:02:31.760> with

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
shift that's why it's indented so with

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.360 
shift that's why it's indented so with
your<00:02:32.030> holding<00:02:32.270> down<00:02:32.360> shift<00:02:32.740> then<00:02:33.740> when<00:02:34.250> you're

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
your holding down shift then when you're

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.040 
your holding down shift then when you're
no<00:02:34.550> longer<00:02:34.700> pressing<00:02:35.150> left<00:02:35.240> now<00:02:35.390> mouse<00:02:35.750> button

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
no longer pressing left now mouse button

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.600 
no longer pressing left now mouse button
that<00:02:36.170> just<00:02:36.350> makes<00:02:36.500> it<00:02:36.620> so<00:02:36.680> like<00:02:37.190> pretty<00:02:37.520> much

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
that just makes it so like pretty much

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.310 
that just makes it so like pretty much
once<00:02:37.850> you<00:02:37.970> let<00:02:38.390> go<00:02:38.510> over<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.750> left<00:02:39.170> mouse

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
once you let go over the left mouse

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.630 
once you let go over the left mouse
button<00:02:39.650> so<00:02:39.800> once<00:02:39.950> you<00:02:40.040> click<00:02:40.190> it<00:02:40.310> and<00:02:40.340> let<00:02:40.489> go

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
button so once you click it and let go

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.479 
button so once you click it and let go
so<00:02:40.790> it<00:02:40.910> can<00:02:41.630> only<00:02:41.750> do<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:42.080> thing<00:02:42.320> once<00:02:42.620> because

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
so it can only do the thing once because

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.250 
so it can only do the thing once because
before<00:02:43.790> I<00:02:43.850> was<00:02:43.880> adding<00:02:44.180> like<00:02:44.330> 10<00:02:44.690> when<00:02:45.050> I<00:02:45.110> only

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
before I was adding like 10 when I only

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.330 
before I was adding like 10 when I only
wanted<00:02:45.530> to<00:02:45.620> do<00:02:45.770> one<00:02:45.950> so<00:02:46.190> that<00:02:46.280> fixes<00:02:46.610> that<00:02:48.340> the

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
wanted to do one so that fixes that the

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.030 
wanted to do one so that fixes that the
global<00:02:49.820> selected<00:02:50.810> number<00:02:50.959> variable<00:02:51.440> so<00:02:51.800> the

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
global selected number variable so the

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.290 
global selected number variable so the
number<00:02:52.250> above<00:02:52.340> my<00:02:52.640> guy's<00:02:52.820> head<00:02:53.000> that's<00:02:53.180> why<00:02:53.270> I

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
number above my guy's head that's why I

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.400 
number above my guy's head that's why I
have<00:02:53.390> all<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.570> numbers<00:02:53.660> above<00:02:53.959> the<00:02:54.080> head<00:02:54.230> so<00:02:54.350> I

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
have all the numbers above the head so I

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.110 
have all the numbers above the head so I
can<00:02:54.560> make<00:02:54.650> this<00:02:54.739> easier<00:02:55.010> to<00:02:55.130> explain<00:02:55.370> because

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
can make this easier to explain because

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.040 
can make this easier to explain because
there's<00:02:56.360> a<00:02:56.420> bunch<00:02:56.600> of<00:02:56.660> different<00:02:56.930> variables

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
there's a bunch of different variables

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.050 
there's a bunch of different variables
and<00:02:57.440> be<00:02:57.530> really<00:02:57.709> confusing<00:02:58.040> so<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.820> number<00:02:59.000> of

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
and be really confusing so the number of

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.510 
and be really confusing so the number of
my<00:02:59.360> head<00:02:59.600> equals<00:03:00.440> it<00:03:00.709> plus<00:03:01.040> one<00:03:01.250> so<00:03:01.370> it<00:03:01.430> adds

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
my head equals it plus one so it adds

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.580 
my head equals it plus one so it adds
one<00:03:01.790> to<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:02.000> number<00:03:02.239> above<00:03:02.540> my<00:03:02.810> head<00:03:02.840> or<00:03:03.350> it

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
one to the number above my head or it

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.110 
one to the number above my head or it
subtracts<00:03:03.800> one<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.459> the<00:03:04.550> number<00:03:04.790> above<00:03:04.850> my

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
subtracts one to the number above my

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.560 
subtracts one to the number above my
head<00:03:05.320> okay<00:03:06.550> and<00:03:07.550> I<00:03:07.700> displays<00:03:08.060> elbow<00:03:08.360> my<00:03:08.480> hip

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
head okay and I displays elbow my hip

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.780 
head okay and I displays elbow my hip
and<00:03:08.900> then<00:03:09.410> WASD<00:03:09.980> is<00:03:10.070> move<00:03:10.250> in<00:03:10.459> the<00:03:10.580> follow

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
and then WASD is move in the follow

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.930 
and then WASD is move in the follow
camera<00:03:11.180> and<00:03:11.360> this<00:03:11.930> is<00:03:12.080> saying<00:03:12.320> I<00:03:12.730> made<00:03:13.730> another

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
camera and this is saying I made another

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.729 
camera and this is saying I made another
variable<00:03:14.390> which<00:03:14.840> is<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:15.170> enemy<00:03:15.500> the

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
variable which is the enemy the

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.390 
variable which is the enemy the
highlighted<00:03:16.160> enemy<00:03:16.959> and<00:03:17.959> so<00:03:18.440> when<00:03:18.680> it's<00:03:18.830> not

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
highlighted enemy and so when it's not

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.210 
highlighted enemy and so when it's not
equal<00:03:19.790> to<00:03:19.820> nothing<00:03:20.110> so<00:03:21.110> actually<00:03:21.470> you

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
equal to nothing so actually you

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.890 
equal to nothing so actually you
actually<00:03:22.550> do<00:03:22.670> need<00:03:22.820> to<00:03:22.940> do<00:03:23.030> a<00:03:23.060> double<00:03:23.270> negative

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
actually do need to do a double negative

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.229 
actually do need to do a double negative
in<00:03:24.230> this<00:03:24.380> case<00:03:24.590> so<00:03:25.459> it's<00:03:25.700> not<00:03:25.850> equal<00:03:26.150> to

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
in this case so it's not equal to

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.750 
in this case so it's not equal to
nothing<00:03:26.390> so<00:03:26.660> when<00:03:26.780> it<00:03:26.870> is<00:03:26.989> something<00:03:27.760> it'll

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
nothing so when it is something it'll

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.759 
nothing so when it is something it'll
shoot<00:03:29.030> at<00:03:29.239> it<00:03:29.269> if<00:03:29.540> i<00:03:29.630> press<00:03:29.810> space<00:03:30.080> or<00:03:30.290> else<00:03:30.500> if

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
shoot at it if i press space or else if

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.480 
shoot at it if i press space or else if
i<00:03:30.860> press<00:03:31.040> space<00:03:31.250> it<00:03:31.370> will<00:03:31.430> just<00:03:31.580> shoot<00:03:31.760> forward

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
i press space it will just shoot forward

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:38.360 
i press space it will just shoot forward
so<00:03:34.970> let's<00:03:35.970> go<00:03:36.240> into<00:03:36.500> this<00:03:37.500> logic<00:03:37.980> cubes<00:03:38.040> brain

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
so let's go into this logic cubes brain

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.590 
so let's go into this logic cubes brain
next<00:03:38.640> and<00:03:38.790> then<00:03:38.850> we'll<00:03:39.000> go<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.210> Goblin

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
next and then we'll go to the Goblin

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.320 
next and then we'll go to the Goblin
which<00:03:39.750> is<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.080> tricky<00:03:40.350> part<00:03:41.120> so<00:03:42.120> this<00:03:42.300> is

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
which is the tricky part so this is

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.810 
which is the tricky part so this is
saying<00:03:43.790> Noah<00:03:44.790> actually<00:03:45.270> let's<00:03:45.480> do<00:03:45.600> the<00:03:45.690> Goblin

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
saying Noah actually let's do the Goblin

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.690 
saying Noah actually let's do the Goblin
so<00:03:47.820> Goblin<00:03:48.690> once<00:03:49.050> just<00:03:50.040> as<00:03:50.160> soon<00:03:50.310> as<00:03:50.460> it's

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
so Goblin once just as soon as it's

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.520 
so Goblin once just as soon as it's
created<00:03:51.120> his<00:03:51.690> number<00:03:51.990> equals<00:03:52.230> that<00:03:52.380> high

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
created his number equals that high

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.010 
created his number equals that high
number<00:03:52.830> so<00:03:52.950> it's<00:03:53.160> not<00:03:53.310> selected<00:03:53.990> and<00:03:54.990> then

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
number so it's not selected and then

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.470 
number so it's not selected and then
when<00:03:56.010> it<00:03:56.100> detects<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.520> player<00:03:56.730> it'll<00:03:57.210> do<00:03:57.330> this

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
when it detects the player it'll do this

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.990 
when it detects the player it'll do this
one<00:03:57.690> time<00:03:57.900> and<00:03:58.200> what<00:03:58.950> it'll<00:03:59.100> do<00:03:59.280> is<00:03:59.490> it'll<00:03:59.580> say

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
one time and what it'll do is it'll say

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.090 
one time and what it'll do is it'll say
my<00:04:00.420> number<00:04:00.750> my<00:04:00.780> own<00:04:01.050> number<00:04:01.410> and<00:04:01.590> that's<00:04:01.830> not

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
my number my own number and that's not

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.670 
my number my own number and that's not
global<00:04:02.610> so<00:04:02.790> it's<00:04:02.940> just<00:04:03.150> in<00:04:03.360> only<00:04:03.630> the<00:04:04.380> single

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
global so it's just in only the single

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.930 
global so it's just in only the single
goblins<00:04:05.160> head<00:04:05.340> so<00:04:06.060> say<00:04:06.330> my<00:04:06.600> number<00:04:06.960> equals<00:04:07.940> the

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
goblins head so say my number equals the

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.180 
goblins head so say my number equals the
global<00:04:09.330> current<00:04:09.660> number<00:04:11.150> which<00:04:12.150> is<00:04:13.190> another

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
global current number which is another

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.580 
global current number which is another
variable<00:04:14.550> that<00:04:14.730> I<00:04:14.790> used<00:04:15.000> to<00:04:15.240> kind<00:04:15.540> of<00:04:15.750> this<00:04:16.440> is

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
variable that I used to kind of this is

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.850 
variable that I used to kind of this is
to<00:04:16.709> be<00:04:16.830> able<00:04:16.920> to<00:04:17.160> make<00:04:18.320> each<00:04:19.320> gobble<00:04:19.680> and<00:04:19.739> have

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:19.860 
to be able to make each gobble and have

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.130 
to be able to make each gobble and have
a<00:04:19.890> different<00:04:20.190> number<00:04:20.310> so<00:04:21.270> his<00:04:21.630> number<00:04:21.870> equals

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
a different number so his number equals

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.590 
a different number so his number equals
the<00:04:22.230> current<00:04:22.500> number<00:04:22.590> plus<00:04:22.890> one<00:04:23.160> and<00:04:23.340> then<00:04:24.240> the

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
the current number plus one and then the

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.060 
the current number plus one and then the
current<00:04:24.930> number<00:04:25.170> equals<00:04:25.500> current<00:04:25.890> number

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
current number equals current number

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.790 
current number equals current number
plus<00:04:26.310> one<00:04:26.520> so<00:04:27.090> what<00:04:27.210> this<00:04:27.330> does<00:04:27.630> so<00:04:28.110> say<00:04:28.410> my

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
plus one so what this does so say my

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.990 
plus one so what this does so say my
number<00:04:29.070> starts<00:04:29.340> off<00:04:29.400> a<00:04:29.460> zero<00:04:29.670> and<00:04:29.790> so<00:04:29.940> does

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
number starts off a zero and so does

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.810 
number starts off a zero and so does
current<00:04:30.330> number<00:04:30.540> so<00:04:31.140> my<00:04:31.950> number<00:04:32.220> equals<00:04:32.520> the

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
current number so my number equals the

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.130 
current number so my number equals the
current<00:04:33.090> number<00:04:33.300> plus<00:04:33.510> one<00:04:33.690> so<00:04:33.870> then<00:04:33.990> you<00:04:34.050> have

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
current number plus one so then you have

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:39.770 
current number plus one so then you have
0<00:04:34.440> plus<00:04:35.400> a<00:04:35.990> 0<00:04:36.990> plus<00:04:37.080> 1<00:04:37.470> right<00:04:37.940> so<00:04:38.940> yeah<00:04:39.360> so<00:04:39.540> 0

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
0 plus a 0 plus 1 right so yeah so 0

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.750 
0 plus a 0 plus 1 right so yeah so 0
plus<00:04:39.840> 1<00:04:40.170> sorry<00:04:40.920> I<00:04:41.010> need<00:04:41.220> to<00:04:41.280> use<00:04:41.370> my<00:04:41.490> mouse<00:04:41.640> I

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
plus 1 sorry I need to use my mouse I

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.100 
plus 1 sorry I need to use my mouse I
means<00:04:41.910> my<00:04:42.030> fingers<00:04:42.330> at<00:04:42.480> plenty<00:04:42.660> of<00:04:42.840> the<00:04:42.900> screen

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
means my fingers at plenty of the screen

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.380 
means my fingers at plenty of the screen
so<00:04:43.560> 0<00:04:43.950> plus<00:04:44.040> 1<00:04:44.490> because<00:04:44.730> this<00:04:44.850> is<00:04:44.970> nothing<00:04:45.270> yet

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
so 0 plus 1 because this is nothing yet

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.800 
so 0 plus 1 because this is nothing yet
so<00:04:45.900> 0<00:04:46.110> plus<00:04:46.170> 1<00:04:46.530> which<00:04:46.770> is<00:04:46.800> 1<00:04:47.100> then<00:04:47.850> the<00:04:48.270> next<00:04:48.420> and

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
so 0 plus 1 which is 1 then the next and

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.420 
so 0 plus 1 which is 1 then the next and
then<00:04:48.990> it<00:04:49.140> adds<00:04:49.260> one<00:04:49.650> to<00:04:49.680> the<00:04:49.890> current<00:04:50.160> number

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
then it adds one to the current number

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.010 
then it adds one to the current number
so<00:04:50.910> now<00:04:51.000> the<00:04:51.090> current<00:04:51.390> number<00:04:51.540> equals<00:04:51.810> one

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
so now the current number equals one

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.320 
so now the current number equals one
because<00:04:52.620> it's<00:04:52.770> another<00:04:53.010> zero<00:04:53.310> plus<00:04:53.490> one<00:04:53.520> so<00:04:54.240> in

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
because it's another zero plus one so in

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.120 
because it's another zero plus one so in
the<00:04:54.420> next<00:04:54.600> goblin<00:04:55.140> once<00:04:55.530> you<00:04:55.650> detects<00:04:55.980> the

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
the next goblin once you detects the

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.790 
the next goblin once you detects the
player<00:04:56.340> his<00:04:57.210> number<00:04:57.540> will<00:04:57.660> equal<00:04:57.960> 1<00:04:58.140> plus<00:04:58.590> 1

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
player his number will equal 1 plus 1

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.010 
player his number will equal 1 plus 1
which<00:04:59.250> is<00:04:59.400> two<00:04:59.610> and<00:04:59.820> then<00:05:00.180> it<00:05:00.300> goes<00:05:00.540> down<00:05:00.600> here

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
which is two and then it goes down here

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.610 
which is two and then it goes down here
and<00:05:01.170> then<00:05:02.040> this<00:05:02.160> becomes<00:05:02.630> a<00:05:03.630> 1<00:05:04.050> plus<00:05:04.260> 1<00:05:04.410> which

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
and then this becomes a 1 plus 1 which

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.760 
and then this becomes a 1 plus 1 which
equals<00:05:04.650> 2<00:05:05.010> as<00:05:05.130> well<00:05:05.360> and<00:05:06.440> it<00:05:07.440> just<00:05:07.620> keeps

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
equals 2 as well and it just keeps

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.170 
equals 2 as well and it just keeps
continuing<00:05:08.070> continuing<00:05:08.370> so<00:05:08.760> they<00:05:08.850> each<00:05:08.970> have

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
continuing continuing so they each have

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.360 
continuing continuing so they each have
their<00:05:09.480> own<00:05:09.810> number<00:05:10.200> hope<00:05:11.010> that<00:05:11.190> made<00:05:11.310> sense

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
their own number hope that made sense

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.180 
their own number hope that made sense
that<00:05:12.240> took<00:05:12.360> me<00:05:12.510> so<00:05:12.690> long<00:05:12.720> to<00:05:13.040> think<00:05:14.040> that

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
that took me so long to think that

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.620 
that took me so long to think that
through<00:05:14.310> my<00:05:14.520> brain<00:05:14.730> and<00:05:15.000> I'm<00:05:15.090> so<00:05:15.210> happy<00:05:15.390> I<00:05:15.510> got

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
through my brain and I'm so happy I got

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.770 
through my brain and I'm so happy I got
to<00:05:15.780> work<00:05:15.900> and<00:05:16.110> then<00:05:16.770> uh<00:05:16.800> so<00:05:17.790> when<00:05:18.060> the<00:05:18.300> selected

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
to work and then uh so when the selected

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.240 
to work and then uh so when the selected
number<00:05:18.870> the<00:05:19.110> number<00:05:19.230> but<00:05:19.590> my<00:05:19.830> character's

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
number the number but my character's

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.060 
number the number but my character's
head<00:05:20.280> is<00:05:20.580> equal<00:05:20.880> to<00:05:21.000> the<00:05:21.120> goblins<00:05:21.510> number<00:05:22.070> then

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
head is equal to the goblins number then

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.700 
head is equal to the goblins number then
the<00:05:23.490> enemy<00:05:23.850> equals<00:05:24.180> me<00:05:24.540> so<00:05:24.900> equals<00:05:25.230> the<00:05:25.350> Goblin

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
the enemy equals me so equals the Goblin

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.129 
the enemy equals me so equals the Goblin
and<00:05:25.880> then<00:05:26.880> so<00:05:27.270> that's<00:05:27.390> that<00:05:27.720> and<00:05:28.080> then

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:30.139 
and then so that's that and then

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:33.740 
and then so that's that and then
in<00:05:31.139> this<00:05:31.440> logic<00:05:31.860> you<00:05:32.040> the<00:05:32.910> it's<00:05:33.360> just<00:05:33.540> saying

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
in this logic you the it's just saying

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.930 
in this logic you the it's just saying
like<00:05:34.320> just<00:05:34.889> started<00:05:35.160> off<00:05:35.280> the<00:05:35.460> current<00:05:35.880> number

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
like just started off the current number

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.029 
like just started off the current number
equals<00:05:36.330> zero<00:05:36.570> the<00:05:37.229> global<00:05:37.620> select<00:05:37.830> a<00:05:37.949> number

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
equals zero the global select a number

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:40.010 
equals zero the global select a number
equals<00:05:38.400> zero<00:05:38.610> it<00:05:39.120> will<00:05:39.150> display<00:05:39.630> the<00:05:39.810> current

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
equals zero it will display the current

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
selected number right and so I can I can

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.180 
selected number right and so I can I can
change<00:05:50.639> that<00:05:50.759> right<00:05:50.910> now<00:05:50.970> all<00:05:51.509> I<00:05:51.539> want<00:05:52.190> which

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
change that right now all I want which

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.800 
change that right now all I want which
is<00:05:53.220> kind<00:05:53.610> of<00:05:53.669> like<00:05:53.789> I<00:05:53.940> need<00:05:54.090> to<00:05:54.150> fix<00:05:54.300> that<00:05:54.419> but

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
is kind of like I need to fix that but

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.379 
is kind of like I need to fix that but

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:57.389 
so if i run into him then the current

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:58.749 
so if i run into him then the current
number<00:05:57.479> is<00:05:57.720> one<00:05:57.930> which<00:05:58.169> is<00:05:58.199> the<00:05:58.410> top<00:05:58.560> middle

00:05:58.749 --> 00:05:58.759 
number is one which is the top middle

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:01.850 
number is one which is the top middle
right<00:05:59.759> so<00:06:00.060> the<00:06:00.180> top<00:06:00.330> metal<00:06:00.509> is<00:06:00.690> one<00:06:00.900> and<00:06:01.139> his
