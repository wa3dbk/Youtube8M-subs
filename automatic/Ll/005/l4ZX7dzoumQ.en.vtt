00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
you want to see my gear you don't

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.560 
you want to see my gear you don't
exactly<00:00:35.190> have<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.460> be<00:00:35.550> sped<00:00:35.820> gear<00:00:36.120> wise<00:00:36.300> for

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
exactly have to be sped gear wise for

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.590 
exactly have to be sped gear wise for
this<00:00:36.660> build<00:00:36.930> because<00:00:37.879> well<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.090> can<00:00:39.210> respect

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
this build because well you can respect

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.569 
this build because well you can respect
for<00:00:39.809> life<00:00:40.260> on<00:00:40.469> hit<00:00:40.739> that's<00:00:41.010> pretty<00:00:41.280> much<00:00:41.399> what

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
for life on hit that's pretty much what

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.049 
for life on hit that's pretty much what
I<00:00:41.610> respect<00:00:41.850> for<00:00:42.500> and<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:44.309> don't<00:00:44.670> know<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:44.789> find

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
I respect for and I don't know I find

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.580 
I respect for and I don't know I find
that<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.329> build<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.930> very<00:00:47.270> very<00:00:48.270> nice<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:49.289> I

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
that this build is very very nice I I

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.420 
that this build is very very nice I I
like<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.370> build<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:51.649> so<00:00:52.649> basically<00:00:52.770> what<00:00:53.340> we

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
like the build and so basically what we

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.849 
like the build and so basically what we
have<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.910> slow<00:00:54.390> time<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.140> Hydra<00:00:55.829> get<00:00:56.430> but

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859 
have is slow time and Hydra get but

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:00.380 
have is slow time and Hydra get but
let's<00:00:58.859> talk<00:00:58.980> about<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.430> movement<00:01:00.090> speed

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
let's talk about the movement speed

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.889 
let's talk about the movement speed
decrease<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.050> we<00:01:01.440> have<00:01:02.300> every<00:01:03.300> time<00:01:03.539> we<00:01:03.719> deal

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
decrease that we have every time we deal

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.289 
decrease that we have every time we deal
arcane<00:01:04.379> damage<00:01:04.860> will<00:01:05.100> be<00:01:05.159> slowing<00:01:05.790> down<00:01:06.060> the

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
arcane damage will be slowing down the

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.770 
arcane damage will be slowing down the
enemy<00:01:06.659> by<00:01:07.530> twenty<00:01:08.010> thirty<00:01:08.610> percent<00:01:09.090> movement

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
enemy by twenty thirty percent movement

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.300 
enemy by twenty thirty percent movement
speed<00:01:10.020> with<00:01:10.290> our<00:01:10.619> passive<00:01:11.100> skill<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.700> then

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
speed with our passive skill and then

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.010 
speed with our passive skill and then
we'll<00:01:14.310> be<00:01:14.460> also<00:01:14.640> slowing<00:01:15.000> down<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.450> enemy

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
we'll be also slowing down the enemy

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.870 
we'll be also slowing down the enemy
movement<00:01:16.409> speed<00:01:16.619> by<00:01:16.770> another<00:01:17.009> twenty<00:01:17.490> percent

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
movement speed by another twenty percent

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.300 
movement speed by another twenty percent
because<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:21.439> because<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.710> time<00:01:23.009> warp

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
because of the because of the time warp

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.719 
because of the because of the time warp
a<00:01:23.960> little<00:01:24.960> time<00:01:25.200> warp<00:01:25.439> bubble<00:01:25.710> there<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.040> you

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
a little time warp bubble there and you

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.249 
a little time warp bubble there and you
know<00:01:26.880> we<00:01:27.090> always<00:01:27.240> have<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.689> good<00:01:27.840> old<00:01:28.020> energy

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
know we always have the good old energy

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.039 
know we always have the good old energy
armor<00:01:28.710> kind<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.369> deal<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.970> everything<00:01:30.299> but

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
armor kind of deal and everything but

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.550 
armor kind of deal and everything but
one<00:01:31.740> one<00:01:32.250> thing<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.640> we<00:01:32.820> do<00:01:33.150> have<00:01:33.750> here<00:01:34.320> that

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
one one thing that we do have here that

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.520 
one one thing that we do have here that
not<00:01:35.390> almost<00:01:36.390> no<00:01:36.509> one<00:01:36.540> uses<00:01:36.869> his<00:01:37.140> arcane

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
not almost no one uses his arcane

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.789 
not almost no one uses his arcane
barrage<00:01:37.740> or<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:39.290> it's<00:01:40.290> not<00:01:40.439> what<00:01:40.560> it's<00:01:40.680> called

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
barrage or is it's not what it's called

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.490 
barrage or is it's not what it's called
me<00:01:41.009> our<00:01:41.180> arcane<00:01:42.180> barrage<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.960> that's<00:01:43.259> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
me our arcane barrage and that's the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.469 
me our arcane barrage and that's the
reason<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.040> as<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.250> secondary<00:01:44.700> skill<00:01:45.090> now

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
reason that as a secondary skill now

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.240 
reason that as a secondary skill now
once<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.750> guys<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.049> look<00:01:46.320> every<00:01:46.950> time<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.220> use

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
once you guys to look every time I use

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.010 
once you guys to look every time I use
our<00:01:47.520> King<00:01:47.729> barrage<00:01:48.090> my<00:01:48.270> arcane<00:01:48.750> power

our King barrage my arcane power

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.060 
our King barrage my arcane power
depletes<00:01:49.890> itself<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.880> only<00:01:51.420> takes<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:52.200> few<00:01:52.229> hits

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
depletes itself it only takes a few hits

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.490 
depletes itself it only takes a few hits
because<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:54.030> my<00:01:54.180> prodigy<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:54.869> what<00:01:55.020> I'm<00:01:55.110> spect

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
because of my prodigy and what I'm spect

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.289 
because of my prodigy and what I'm spect
for<00:01:56.299> so<00:01:57.299> my<00:01:57.509> passive<00:01:58.140> skill<00:01:58.409> prodigy<00:01:58.950> and<00:02:01.009> also

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
for so my passive skill prodigy and also

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.300 
for so my passive skill prodigy and also
so<00:02:03.299> yeah<00:02:03.540> more<00:02:04.320> passive<00:02:04.649> skills<00:02:04.860> prodigy

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
so yeah more passive skills prodigy
