 hockey first official rules 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.320

 hockey players do not play wooden 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.849
 clubs that was the norm 10 years ago 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.430
 when the national team players were undermining you 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.829
 themselves bend fasteners sit now no longer 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.719
 You will see the clubs are made by special order from 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.640
 composite materials of a million 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.219
 The handle says that it is made

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.930
 about preference stiffness sizes and even 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.539
 roughness of the handle and so on all 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.530
 hockey players of all leading teams of the world 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.530

 not without reason the rules are strictly negotiated 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.410
 hook width must be no more than 7 s 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.620
 half centimeters but not less than five 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.580
 its length is maximum 32 centimeters and bending 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.920
 no more than one and a half

 peak point latest development 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.330
 this season the possibility of players with 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.310
 ordering a stick to choose in which 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.610

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.380
 Seasonal sheets need a few dozen 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:43.080
 how much mug season are we ever 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:47.780
 counted at home 60 top 70 I think that 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.780
 leaving but the power of hockey is not all 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.050

 club hook if you replace the puck with an egg 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.100
 it will be clear that the real professional 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.440
 able to and carefully handle on ice and 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.630
 with such a fragile subject in the game is 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.700
 gentle appeal is very important similar 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.770
 ease is achieved by perennial in 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.750
 number and strength training 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.450
 strengthening not only brush rub well and 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.610
 shoulder girdle and all that leg 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.320
 works while dribbling perfect

 year-round workouts exactly that 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.450
 lets so control the steps by the way 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.720
 few people know that a little more than a hundred years 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.030
 back the rubber washer was wooden and 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.770
 familiar all the same then it drop 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.110
 highly traumatic referee in the studio 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.010
 put the puck on the ice kept the buns 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.390
 players and simultaneously let them go 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.120
 modern to our usual version 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.010
 throw-in already 114 years in that time 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.470
 so much has changed above all 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.330
 the appearance of goalkeepers initially they are few 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.670
 what was different from the field players then 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.690
 began a kind of arms race 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.400
 bro shines 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.290
 lovki which led to the fact that goalkeepers 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.770
 gradually began to increase in 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.290
 sizes 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.300
 at the expense of the form judge for yourself 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.010
 razmerchik who was at the end of the nineteenth 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.410
 centuries when they first moved 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.690
 which crickett at the end of the twentieth during 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.670
 times vladislav tretyak steel shields 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.910
 but a little bit more covering up 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.260
 colleagues are now the size of it 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.330
 regulate account width no more 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.240
 twenty eight centimeters height 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.120
 depends on height but maximum 27 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.230
 centimeters above the goalkeeper's knee 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.120
 sleeve width is also regulated 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.920
 orator sweater not long ago in 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.870
 nineties some goalkeepers put in 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.490
 wire in extended sleeves and they 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.620
 almost completely blocked 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.440
 twist winx square catch the puck 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.390
 the goalkeeper harder and harder here 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.920
 leaves while playing prefab level 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.050
 about which professionalism 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.240
 same average per match 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.580
 only five goals him attract viewers 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.230
 this is not enough why hockey is constantly 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.300
 there are experiments like rules 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.280
 for example the last sentence from the minute 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.590
 in the offside position and with external 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.540
 kind of players eighties to nations 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.670
 We tried to put players in shorts and not a 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.830
 in the pants but it didn’t look like 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.200
 it's not for hockey yet equipment 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.630
 remained the same viewer does not see 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.970

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.200
 elbow knee shell as 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.840
 call yourself what numbers 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.560
 groin protection by the way she is in female 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.930

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:20.519
 a - all and kristoff serves for that 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:24.060
 to face the enemy by no means 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:26.210
 case side or back god hobby in 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.400
 such do not turn 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.169
 seemingly protected player all the time 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.419
 practically open and lower back 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:35.690
 and sides at hand back surface 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.440

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.810
 same person 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.610
 Helmet safety glass withstands direct 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.490
 hit the puck and as shown by our 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.289
 hammer blow experiment but does not save 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.000
 from the most common to date 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:48.319
 day and in such concussion injuries 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 average speed 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:52.610

 Hour 40 kilometers per hour average live bait 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.699

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.009
 the form 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:00.289
 months so fierce and 16 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:02.720
 kilogram weight just such a weight 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:04.940
 carries on players all 60 minutes of the match 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.610
 and maintaining a high pace occur 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.650
 frequent replacements here one segment with 1 eyes 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.630
 which of the table he can only 30 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.669
 seconds during this time the player has time 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.930
 touch step only one or two times but 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.940
 this is considered normal 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.710
 average striker top five 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.380
 spend on the site for the entire match 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.910
 just 20 minutes 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.640
 do you run your time during this time 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.290
 tanks about 30 kilometers modern 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.290
 hockey end must withstand not 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:31.300
 only running but also shock loads 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:33.640
 it is made of plastic especially attention 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.770
 protecting the cape of the ridge and all its side 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.390
 the surface while in the sole there 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.820
 ventilation holes 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.980
 some players don't play socks like that 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.900
 the end feels better special attention 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.910
 give with a blade more precisely the process of it 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.430
 sharpening it is completely different for 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:53.970
 defenders and attackers first thing so 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:57.430
 called playground playground this that is 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:59.830
 the area of support on the ice is main where 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.930
 repelled by a hockey player she can be 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.940
 less can more playground for 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.860
 the attacker sharpens with the offset and 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.870
 tilting forward this allows you to increase 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.240
 starting speed of the athlete due to 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:12.670
 push and roll forward derived from the slope at the 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.070
 defenders on the contrary the court moves 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.840
 back but no tilt to improve 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.000
 skating backs but it's all very 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.980
 individually according to a servismeny 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.380
 our team some players sharpens skates 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.710
 after each workout for example ovechkin 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.230
 and kovalchuk that is two to three times a day 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:30.420
 people are much less often very technical 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.430
 equipping nothing without player skill 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.290
 and looking 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.960
 they are qualities of which a hundred years 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.730
 back and now it’s impossible to imagine for 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.100
 the whole history of Russian is now only two 

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:41.420
 teams won 8 times 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:44.120
 gold to 

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:47.240
 we and Canadians Vancouver's native to them 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.310
 2010 won they will win gold on 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:52.930
 Native Olympiad for us in Sochi will be 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.930
 well known spa
