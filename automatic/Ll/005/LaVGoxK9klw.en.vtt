00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:13.730
 hello everyone my name is yuri this is such a 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.660
 us heading subheading one-on-one where 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.810
 our 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.940
 our knightly infantry union baron under 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.790
 the command of the commander then the mass will be 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:27.590
 fight against you grandfather hiking 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:30.710
 knights of norwegian commander frederik then 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:35.719
 there is such a kind of enemy appearance principle 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:42.530
 This picture will show how our experience in those 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:44.630
 and those three golden towers go shields then 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.450
 they have armor and weapons too 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:51.680
 the same she goes for 1 the very first 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:54.579
 improved and here begins the descent 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.070
 difficult is the tallest that is 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:00.110
 practically contributed and nine percent 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:03.649
 the left always get a computer on themselves 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:07.880
 defeated player 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:11.590
 Yes, he's here at the time Perhaps ahead 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:16.880
 Yes, Masha, too, a little bit under the onslaught 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:20.450
 attacked the enemy the outcome will of course 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.159
 lines defeat just how it all will 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.779
 happen will happen all this 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.079
 pretty interesting firstly at once 

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:30.289
 same as against 103 to 105 and so there place 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:37.939
 98 already played even against 101 we 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:40.069
 Lead for now and trick the enemy commander 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:46.999
 Frederick died 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:49.549
 died why in principle why do we give 

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:53.240
 the enemy they are not us the point is that 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:56.899
 initially the number of rows on these 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.840
 Here is a fly of their ranks and narrow 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:03.340
 ranks a little bit like that rectangle 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.169
 not quite elongated and successful 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.630
 collision naturally us 

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:11.080
 being forced 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.420
 and here I took our ours 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.470
 divisions mouse sprained that is when 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.900
 meeting with the enemy 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.180
 as we rounded it turns out the enemy is soaring 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.840
 already from the flanks killed here in principle 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.130
 also 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.900
 flank recording a little bit already even imaginary 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.030
 at the side 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.459
 so commander commander ok usually 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:35.550
 is with us on the very edge on 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:38.650
 advanced to got us with the sword joke 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:43.330
 safely died so now moral 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.940
 the enemy will fall only thing that I 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:51.670
 a little bit so embarrassed that all the same all 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:55.420
 after all already 62 against 563 that is 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:03:03.840
 curd lost half of the fighters now we 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:06.819
 also lose half of the fighters lost 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.099
 quietly up to not hearing the enemy i 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:12.180
 Look what I have here for example the 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:14.859
 the flag will now just sink a part 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.870
 where there seems to be boredom 3 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:19.540
 knight up vs even at four 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.540
 we are not three knights for long and here we are from 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.760
 time two three 4 5 and 6 years 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:32.040
 quietly these two and even fight 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:34.299
 pokachu fit there are 6 against three and 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.840
 things only get worse and worse 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:40.329
 get worse and these here seem to be fighting 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.000
 guys from the last strength and strength of their 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.700
 heroic squeeze all that is and 1 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.560
 score of 3 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.639
 one for all and all for push already too 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:54.670
 wounded once well us tritons but 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:04:00.880
 not long before and almost juice here 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:06.220
 it turns out 6 against one and naturally 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:08.230
 side and water traitor killer scare then 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:13.799
 there is no other eye at all 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:15.900
 and the situation began to deteriorate t-34 against 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:19.970
 34 to 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:24.990
 with an equal amount usually wins 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:28.259
 3133 seems to be the enemy before they even 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:32.570
 there is hope and then it started just 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:36.930
 began our us began will know 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:40.639
 this trick and not feints scales back and here 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:44.639
 so here we are right in the foot all killed 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:49.260
 here's trying to see a friend for revenge and 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:52.050
 does not work and here we have appeared 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:57.030
 the hero is the hero of the battle because he is a little bit like 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:58.620
 hiding behind its warriors such 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.229
 the real commander that is not climbing 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.289
 ahead and warriors and a little bit pushing aside 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:07.190
 enemy legs are not so good these 22 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:11.550
 against 28 the enemy is already starting us 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:15.539
 push sell well 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:19.430
 is it powerful even if our troem 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:23.729
 already approached and bursts commander 1 2 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:27.300
 just about the types all belly ripped 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:27.930
 he is all following who is there next by 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.190
 accounts 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:35.159

 block the sword on the backswing of the white enemy 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:47.760
 he still shoved his helmet all at once 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:50.909
 It is still played on his left and the nail tried 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:54.090
 I can't break through and the whole belly again 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:58.620
 ripped open his stomach again 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:59.940
 wiped immediately following once that's straight 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.760
 don't stop 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.710
 wanted left failed him again in 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.650
 the heart we see will support little and 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:11.210
 slam husband saw once again you all went 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:13.229

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.500
 noble hair 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:19.610
 stuck a sword 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:22.100
 there is further the next blow falls again 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:25.370

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:28.400

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:30.140
 gone fur we drive to the river and drove 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:34.370
 braces wondered why give them to the river 

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:37.610

 that is, there is an opportunity to defeat the enemy 

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.220
 and we are tall 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.560
 such complexity if they are correct 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:03.160
 practically apply that is this 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.960
