00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
that shield gets a 50-percent

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.090 
that shield gets a 50-percent
electricity<00:01:35.960> damage<00:01:36.259> bonus<00:01:36.440> to<00:01:36.680> whatever

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
electricity damage bonus to whatever

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
deal if that weapon has a travel time as

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.660 
deal if that weapon has a travel time as
soon<00:01:42.229> as<00:01:42.380> that<00:01:42.500> projectile<00:01:42.979> hits<00:01:43.250> the<00:01:43.400> shield

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
soon as that projectile hits the shield

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.390 
soon as that projectile hits the shield
it<00:01:44.060> becomes<00:01:44.450> hits<00:01:44.720> can<00:01:44.960> oh<00:01:45.260> and<00:01:46.040> you<00:01:46.130> know<00:01:46.250> how

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
it becomes hits can oh and you know how

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.430 
it becomes hits can oh and you know how
a<00:01:46.430> lot<00:01:46.670> of<00:01:46.790> weapons<00:01:46.940> have<00:01:47.330> a<00:01:47.600> maximum<00:01:47.960> distance

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
a lot of weapons have a maximum distance

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.160 
a lot of weapons have a maximum distance
yeah<00:01:49.430> that's<00:01:49.670> gone<00:01:49.880> your<00:01:50.540> range<00:01:50.840> becomes

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
yeah that's gone your range becomes

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.289 
yeah that's gone your range becomes
infinite<00:01:51.619> for<00:01:51.740> that<00:01:51.860> weapon<00:01:52.040> and<00:01:52.430> this<00:01:52.970> even

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
infinite for that weapon and this even

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.060 
infinite for that weapon and this even
applies<00:01:53.570> to<00:01:53.780> shotguns<00:01:54.290> of<00:01:54.470> their<00:01:54.560> damage<00:01:54.830> drop

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
applies to shotguns of their damage drop

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.800 
applies to shotguns of their damage drop
off<00:01:55.250> they<00:01:55.490> lose<00:01:55.729> their<00:01:55.970> damage<00:01:56.240> drop<00:01:56.479> off<00:01:56.659> as

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
off they lose their damage drop off as

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.690 
off they lose their damage drop off as
soon<00:01:56.960> as<00:01:57.049> they<00:01:57.140> hit<00:01:57.229> that<00:01:57.409> shield<00:01:57.710> so<00:01:58.460> let's

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
soon as they hit that shield so let's

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.859 
soon as they hit that shield so let's
take<00:01:58.820> a<00:01:58.880> look<00:01:59.030> at<00:01:59.119> a<00:01:59.150> few<00:01:59.210> different<00:01:59.420> weapons

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
take a look at a few different weapons

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.420 
take a look at a few different weapons
here<00:02:00.020> how<00:02:00.229> they're<00:02:00.470> uniquely<00:02:00.830> affected<00:02:01.340> by

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
here how they're uniquely affected by

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.090 
here how they're uniquely affected by
the<00:02:01.490> electric<00:02:01.880> shield<00:02:02.439> so<00:02:03.439> first<00:02:03.680> up<00:02:03.920> we've

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
the electric shield so first up we've

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.950 
the electric shield so first up we've
got<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:04.580> flamethrower<00:02:05.240> type<00:02:05.510> weapons<00:02:05.869> it

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
got the flamethrower type weapons it

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.560 
got the flamethrower type weapons it
includes<00:02:06.290> the<00:02:06.500> ignis<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:07.430> embolus<00:02:07.880> as<00:02:08.149> well

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
includes the ignis the embolus as well

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.900 
includes the ignis the embolus as well
as<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:08.959> recent<00:02:09.290> emprex<00:02:09.679> weapons<00:02:10.070> now<00:02:10.759> what

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
as the recent emprex weapons now what

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.070 
as the recent emprex weapons now what
happens<00:02:11.150> when<00:02:11.269> you<00:02:11.330> fire<00:02:11.540> through<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:11.870> shield

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
happens when you fire through the shield

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.630 
happens when you fire through the shield
on<00:02:12.230> these<00:02:12.380> is<00:02:12.680> they<00:02:12.830> lose<00:02:13.100> their<00:02:13.340> clin<00:02:13.519> of

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
on these is they lose their clin of

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.460 
on these is they lose their clin of
effect<00:02:13.940> but<00:02:14.480> they<00:02:14.630> basically<00:02:14.870> become<00:02:15.170> a<00:02:15.200> laser

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
effect but they basically become a laser

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.400 
effect but they basically become a laser

fire weapons these basically function

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.970 
fire weapons these basically function
roughly<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:47.959> same<00:02:48.139> they<00:02:48.320> get<00:02:48.440> a<00:02:48.470> big<00:02:48.650> damage

roughly the same they get a big damage
boost<00:02:49.250> but<00:02:49.579> they<00:02:49.669> get<00:02:49.820> infinite<00:02:50.150> range<00:02:50.329> that's

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690

the<00:02:50.870> big<00:02:51.019> gimmick<00:02:51.200> with<00:02:51.470> them

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
the big gimmick with them

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.979 
the big gimmick with them
now<00:02:52.790> if<00:02:52.909> there<00:02:53.060> was<00:02:53.150> any<00:02:53.299> set<00:02:53.510> of<00:02:53.540> weapons<00:02:53.750> a

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
now if there was any set of weapons a

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.390 
now if there was any set of weapons a
benefit<00:02:54.319> of<00:02:54.409> the<00:02:54.470> most<00:02:54.680> out<00:02:54.890> of<00:02:54.920> this<00:02:55.099> it's

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
benefit of the most out of this it's

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.000 
benefit of the most out of this it's
definitely<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:56.209> supra<00:02:56.599> in<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:56.930> Darra<00:02:57.170> both

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
definitely the supra in the Darra both

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.289 
definitely the supra in the Darra both
of<00:02:58.159> these<00:02:58.220> weapons<00:02:58.459> suffer<00:02:58.939> from<00:02:59.030> a<00:02:59.150> long

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
of these weapons suffer from a long

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:00.819 
of these weapons suffer from a long
travel<00:02:59.599> time<00:02:59.900> on<00:03:00.049> their<00:03:00.140> shots<00:03:00.379> but<00:03:00.620> as<00:03:00.709> soon
