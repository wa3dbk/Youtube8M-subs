00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 Hi everyone, everything is good today I came to give 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.609
 tips for you that can help you 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.750
 finish did that book you are 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.750
 coiling a long time ago 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.830
 The first tip I have to give 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.590
 you have to do with focus on people 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.840
 wrote a book only I've seen many 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.300
 new authors speak and write two or more 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.560
 more books because it started with 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.930
 inspiration to write in one 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.420
 describe another agent 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.890
 This is going to help rather than help. 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.710
 your work will end up disturbing 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.329
 because the book will eventually get 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.940
 difficult wrote because you are not 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.680
 so excited or because there are things to 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.640
 research you are doing in between 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.070
 of history 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.090
 and then you end up discouraged and go pro 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.370
 another book 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.570
 and then when you get to that moment in the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.399
 another day you'll write another 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.010
 You will have a book with several books. 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.070
 started did not end no knows then 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.600
 though it may be difficult tiring 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.829
 keep a single book so you go 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.620
 reach the end of it 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.570
 The second tip is not in a personal hurry 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.760
 and I 'm not going to tell you to relax 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.920
 to be left with your project 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.350
 speaking of the type is worth much more 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.080
 You write a nice book a book. 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.010
 right than a book you wrote 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.630
 no and sat 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.520
 jorge martinho say that ten years from now 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.020
 years nobody will want to know how much 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.490
 It took you a while to write your 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.159
 book is just wondering if your book is 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.689
 well then type is works more or less 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.490
 as someone who goes to the race of 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.990
 they are wild only for sightseeing 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.430
 You do not have to run because you do not 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.270
 want to get in the first place is not 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.009
 stolen 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.020
 But you can not stop walking because 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.520
 sometime you have to get there 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.930
 The third thing I want to tell you is 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.950
 It is that it's always a good time to 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.720
 to work 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.430
 There are days that you do not know 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.810
 write that scene that one 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.670
 chapter that dialogue you 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.689
 it's just not in the mood for it 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.790
 happens 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.259
 But that does not mean you do not 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.100
 Are you tired to create you're not going? 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.810
 to work 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.210
 you can hold your book you can 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.100
 to research things you will do a 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.409
 countless things know and no use 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.780
 you speak that you have already received that 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.180
 stretch and that is now ok 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.740
 one example is that Danilo had already 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.930
 carried out his book 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.420
 the auditorium had already warned and in the last 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.890
 day 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.539
 the demand for graphics still changed 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.610
 things because you can always improve 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.190
 the physical part has something to do with 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.140
 third is the following work according to 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.530
 with your schedule not according to your 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.300
 that is, it establishes a goal not to 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.880
 over time words 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.410
 if your free time is too short and 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.360
 and have half an hour a day to 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.010
 able to work on your book in that 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.600
 half an hour you'll do your best 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.280
 even if you are not willing to 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.069
 write will do other things but 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.290
 at that moment you will write and 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.120
 So there's going to be a day that you want. 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.180
 kick the bucket you're going to want to say no 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.319
 today is not going on that day you can do 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.780
 But only when you have it in your 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.430
 limit is not lazy but because it is 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.590
 tired because the other obligations 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.019
 are finally overloading any 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.910
 another reason that is valid but also 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.519
 not for me soft hotel in the day 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.040
 next time back to its schedule that the 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.920
 said people writing in the first place 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.709
 a point anything else that you 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.510
 Want to do some kind of watching a movie or go 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.940
 to the beach or travel 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.489
 I do not know anything else left 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.200
 writing first work first know 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.060
 You need to take the series to the 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.130
 other people who take seriously 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.230
 Imagine if a surgeon does so 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.150
 I 'm going to do your surgery but first 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.859
 in the movies because I 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.120
 friends loved the father of the dwarf star 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:30.609
 john green do not prepare to select and 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.560
 exclude us not everything you 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:34.329
 write to the public 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.160
 sometimes you are planning a book and 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.019
 there you want to write a scene that does not 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.570
 will contribute nothing, only you think 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.970
 cute write and save for you 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.950
 know the solution because we already you 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.870
 be describing a scene that does not have 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.030
 nothing to see and who will fit it into the 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.910
 your planning and will only delay and 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.620
 mess up the other thing you're of sense 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.340
 critical when you go is your own 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.049
 book 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.060
 so it is more common than offices 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:00.340
 they do not like what they describe than 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.730
 find here what they described is the maximum 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.200
 but not so it is pay attention what 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.790
 It's working here. It's going to work. 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.790
 You always ask yourself that. 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.110
 What you have to erase what you do not 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.510
 have to pay personal access same tip 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.640
 What I have to give you is write. 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.530
 about something you know 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.620
 so you do not want to invent 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.350
 from your head do you want to write about 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.700
 subject Sunday and he before and so 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.140
 not something that is in your 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.390
 reality in your daily life for example 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.640
 those who have a fantasy of age 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.310
 Average, it's good that a lot of people wrote 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.820
 but if you want those 15 years of research 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:41.100
 well read books watch movies queue 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.020
 studies on the subject so that you can 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.730
 feel comfortable to talk 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.590
 understand or at least if it is not a 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.930
 thing you see with your own 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.220
 day-to-day eyes is going to be something that 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.500
 You'll already have mastered why you 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.150
 researched these were the tips that can 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.950
 help finish writing your book 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.880
 I hope you have liked to 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.460
 would have helped 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.110
 I hope you will make success and 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.600
 more content about books literature 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:16.440
 remains on the path to have area 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:22.700
 I do not know, I do not know, I do not know, I think 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:25.620
 is web play is the 9 mm mini 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:29.330
 people say you left there 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.330
 reports speak a series of background rolled 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.260
 with sugar
