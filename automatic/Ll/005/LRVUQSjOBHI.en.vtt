halftime at 11 but I was pretty

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.490 
halftime at 11 but I was pretty

another good shot and he's saved again
the<00:04:04.019> board<00:04:04.200> then<00:04:04.440> drops<00:04:04.829> hell<00:04:05.010> to<00:04:05.549> a<00:04:05.579> demo

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
the board then drops hell to a demo

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.180 
the board then drops hell to a demo
eventually<00:04:06.900> who<00:04:07.079> does<00:04:07.320> have<00:04:07.590> another<00:04:07.890> shot

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
eventually who does have another shot

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.069 
eventually who does have another shot
blocked<00:04:08.730> and<00:04:09.180> it<00:04:09.269> does<00:04:09.390> go<00:04:09.540> out<00:04:09.600> for<00:04:09.810> a<00:04:09.870> further

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
blocked and it does go out for a further

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:11.960 
blocked and it does go out for a further
corner<00:04:10.500> so<00:04:10.650> clearly<00:04:11.040> we're<00:04:11.280> on<00:04:11.400> top<00:04:11.700> in<00:04:11.850> this

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
game to start off with so I was hoping

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:15.259 
game to start off with so I was hoping
that<00:04:13.920> we<00:04:14.070> could<00:04:14.100> continue<00:04:14.579> that<00:04:14.910> for<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:15.120> rest

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
that we could continue that for the rest

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:16.580 
that we could continue that for the rest
of<00:04:15.329> the<00:04:15.420> game<00:04:15.570> and<00:04:15.720> then<00:04:15.840> its<00:04:15.989> Lucas<00:04:16.350> that<00:04:16.500> has

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
of the game and then its Lucas that has

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.770 
of the game and then its Lucas that has
a<00:04:16.620> snapshot<00:04:16.950> that<00:04:17.220> goes<00:04:17.430> narrowly<00:04:17.820> wide<00:04:18.030> over

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
a snapshot that goes narrowly wide over

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.000 
a snapshot that goes narrowly wide over
the<00:04:18.870> by<00:04:18.959> third<00:04:19.200> rifled<00:04:19.560> into<00:04:19.620> the<00:04:19.799> top<00:04:19.979> corner

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
the by third rifled into the top corner

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.289 
the by third rifled into the top corner
that<00:04:20.340> had<00:04:20.459> been<00:04:20.549> an<00:04:20.669> absolutely<00:04:21.060> beautiful

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
that had been an absolutely beautiful

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.570 
that had been an absolutely beautiful
girl<00:04:21.900> to<00:04:21.930> score<00:04:22.320> but<00:04:22.440> unfortunately<00:04:23.340> it

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
girl to score but unfortunately it

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.610
