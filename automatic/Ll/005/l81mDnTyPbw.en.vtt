States small numbers we only do about a
hundred<00:00:56.370> bodies<00:00:56.670> right<00:00:57.059> now<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.239> year<00:00:57.570> next

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
hundred bodies right now a year next

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.139 
hundred bodies right now a year next
year<00:00:58.460> we'll<00:00:59.460> probably<00:00:59.640> do<00:01:00.000> closer<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.899> 200<00:01:01.559> but

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.660 
existence that I know of prior to us
starting<00:02:11.690> this<00:02:11.810> project<00:02:12.110> so<00:02:12.650> we've<00:02:13.280> got<00:02:13.459> five

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
starting this project so we've got five

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.830 
starting this project so we've got five
pages<00:02:14.000> and<00:02:15.040> just<00:02:16.040> details<00:02:16.459> on<00:02:16.670> how<00:02:17.150> you<00:02:17.180> modify

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
pages and just details on how you modify

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.180 
pages and just details on how you modify
the<00:02:17.900> binding<00:02:18.380> for<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.590> different<00:02:18.890> parts<00:02:19.130> of

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
the binding for the different parts of

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.030 
the binding for the different parts of
the<00:02:19.250> guitar<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:20.319> how<00:02:21.319> you<00:02:21.380> put<00:02:21.799> the<00:02:21.890> two

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
the guitar and how you put the two

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.190 
the guitar and how you put the two
pieces<00:02:22.069> together<00:02:22.519> I<00:02:23.000> suggest<00:02:23.540> using<00:02:23.720> a<00:02:23.959> thin

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
pieces together I suggest using a thin

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.229 
pieces together I suggest using a thin
to<00:02:24.319> medium<00:02:24.470> thick<00:02:24.830> once<00:02:25.610> you<00:02:25.730> sandwich<00:02:26.090> the

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
to medium thick once you sandwich the

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.660 
to medium thick once you sandwich the
two<00:02:26.390> sections<00:02:27.350> together<00:02:27.470> and<00:02:27.860> slowly<00:02:28.340> running

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
two sections together and slowly running

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.670 
two sections together and slowly running
it<00:02:28.850> along<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.120> sides<00:02:29.510> as<00:02:29.810> you<00:02:29.959> apply<00:02:30.319> pressure

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
it along the sides as you apply pressure

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.190 
it along the sides as you apply pressure
and<00:02:31.100> then<00:02:32.000> when<00:02:32.630> you're<00:02:32.720> holding<00:02:32.959> it<00:02:33.049> together

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
and then when you're holding it together

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.460 
and then when you're holding it together
then<00:02:33.560> you<00:02:33.650> start<00:02:34.549> screwing<00:02:35.330> in<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.569> back<00:02:35.780> one

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
then you start screwing in the back one

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:44.880 
then you start screwing in the back one
by<00:02:36.650> one<00:02:38.680> we've<00:02:39.680> had<00:02:40.480> probably<00:02:41.480> almost<00:02:42.700> I'd<00:02:43.700> say

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
by one we've had probably almost I'd say

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.099 
by one we've had probably almost I'd say
six<00:02:45.890> dozen<00:02:46.250> borders<00:02:47.209> of<00:02:47.239> just<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:47.720> binding

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
six dozen borders of just the binding

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:50.319 
six dozen borders of just the binding
over<00:02:48.380> the<00:02:48.470> last<00:02:48.620> year<00:02:48.980> so<00:02:49.940> we've<00:02:50.060> made<00:02:50.090> a<00:02:50.239> lot

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
over the last year so we've made a lot

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.390 
over the last year so we've made a lot
of<00:02:50.480> people<00:02:50.600> happy<00:02:51.109> that<00:02:51.290> have<00:02:51.739> had<00:02:51.980> vintage

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.979 
of people happy that have had vintage
guitars<00:02:52.790> and<00:02:53.060> these<00:02:53.329> parts<00:02:53.630> weren't<00:02:53.810> being

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
guitars and these parts weren't being

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.340 
guitars and these parts weren't being
made<00:02:54.290> so<00:02:54.709> we're<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.430> only<00:02:55.519> manufacturer<00:02:56.150> of

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350

made so we're the only manufacturer of
these<00:02:57.710> parts<00:02:58.100> and<00:02:58.540> I'm<00:02:59.540> proud<00:02:59.780> that<00:02:59.960> we're

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
these parts and I'm proud that we're

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
these parts and I'm proud that we're
both<00:03:00.680> reissuing<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.430> vintage<00:03:02.000> parts<00:03:02.360> but<00:03:03.340> you
