00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:04.100
 the revenge has not succeeded in the Prisma studies also the return match against 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.800
 the Kiel Baltic Hurricanes with 23 to distort a game 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.550
 which at least at the beginning seemed very erratic where both teams 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.609
 scanned in the first quarter, there were no points 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:17.849
 from this summer the pages on the Christmas riding did not come yet 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:19.060
 really into the gears 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.630
 But she was beating the suppliers and on weaknesses on request what his 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.069
 opinion 

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:27.069
 So we should have run a bit weaker so should fall 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:30.719
 you can not really get going it was really a sampling anyway 

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:33.880
 Percent it can not be seen 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.310
 has really nice 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.350
 right game for big dogs or unpacked officials 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.140
 stop it 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.220
 only good friend was sung then finally rewarded with points 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.930
 the Kieler offense was the evidence differently because the slightly better occurs in the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.639
 In the true sense of the word, Heike Rheine has led 

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:53.670
 interviewed his crew raids 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.750
 a kilo more 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.200
 Wikipedia said Dr 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.080
 The first two days stood up to run every two years 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.600
 Alexander Gehbauer for the interim 13 10 0 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.240
 there was the hope that it could go on like this 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.689
 yes, certainly are in the phase of the game around 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.369
 Kings then came in well wanting to month even in ORF 1 even there 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.110
 a lot to see or think of okay so it goes on here today 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.870
 around 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.570
 The only good thing is that only the 2 that show in the "First" is heart-demanding 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.560
 Consultant I was right remind him of SCO companion so four years 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.520
 Surely there was one of the killers was not just one, it was only 102 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.810
 Seconds on the clock which already had just before half time and 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.280
 are thus a very worth seeing 3 for the whole field has always gone 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.150
 met again on Wartburg 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.600
 and then at the end a 25 years passive at the roundabout on the same Rothko 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.210
 though on 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.620
 for the meantime 13 to 7 and there then germinated again hope that 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.510
 maybe now the attacking machine on the way 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.870
 get going 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.790
 At the time the case points him just before half time were then thought with 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.480
 The momentum then comes back to the field 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.580
 this year perhaps also Solarworld lie worried the word at the moment would always 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.730
 grow there have played latency 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.890
 a contractual relationship as we thought we were doing and not yet 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.460
 but researches 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.540
 here was the end of the Summer Show announced so it is clear that we are 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.299
 but did not succeed 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:17.439
 at the time than a year ago Federal Council Burkhalter was also the house 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:20.360
 in the third quarter namely could already take the lead by one 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.150
 very worth seeing 53 yard run of Michaela draft across friend and 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.819
 Enemy through into the end zone 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.310
 Oliver Wight led through the newly transformed next point of Rupert 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.809
 Summer a year ago had a make up there is neither 13 4 percent 

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:37.440
 and if so, then the game bounced a bit back and forth but then 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.770
 BZ they are angry times the routine of retiring party people last year food figure 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:42.969
 by Florian Dannehl 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:46.749
 and then finally the third part is from Alexander Gehbauer 

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:50.080
 which then finally sealed the 23 addition the final score 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.770
 Last but not least the Chorizo ​​Tino Horat you just see the windows Turismo DAX 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.809
 played again 

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:58.959
 We may have that it may have been the window months 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.959
 possible green-red towards the end 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.829
 Percent on in the meantime of Leekens also times large space gains then into 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.419
 Goal but team does not complete the points 

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:11.159
 then in the end the luck works first with the much coal where you agree also 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.659
 Both can be even more draus but at least the three points 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:15.819
 taken and then the long gate 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.829
 about 90 yards percent over whether her short run and 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.219
 Aleks dear of ours you can really go over the field in big pieces 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.409
 I think that was pretty good then 4000 is not always that kind of a bit 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:28.619
 break 

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:31.539
 the player is in the Prestamo can reach after the resurgence 

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:35.729
 the Canes area here just does not win now the 23 10 14 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:36.400
 -defeat 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.010
 For both teams next week is quite exciting tasks 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.740
 Portraits way into all this is food for 9 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.959
 Rising star hit the German champion mass murderer maintenance 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.430
 Jake I hope it's not the right one 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.709
 The players are curious about the game Essen here in Kiel 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.280
 just so in the last two and a half minutes could not bend to have 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.859
 just to put weight because she sees 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.469
 the team also makes it so very exciting 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:05.019
 Eating is a whole tough opponent running games is really percent 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.349
 outstanding percent you have to set very subwoofer Killed the Fence 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.119
 Weakness this year a bit for my taste 

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:13.109
 and that will still be 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.620
 probably just as scarce thing never the first game against food 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.690
 and read all the world as if we were against it in the cabin 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.870
 Comparing to the playoffs, of course we would thumb the cage 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.250
 Thomas Lunz and speaks for the dressage riders are not exactly easier 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.160
 The league leaders will list the Berlin Adler 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.720
 after what you saw here today what in Bavaria but the pass-game 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.620
 next Saturday 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.570
 the topic is yes Modern% Mom increase especially in the offense I am one 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:38.419
 little 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.870
 disappointed I have to say I've actually caught more fortress today 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.630
 After the explosion, the increase in both home games 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.250
 Surely those were two completely different ones from there as well 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.949
 stronger rocking our city much stronger and before where they are 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:53.120
 our opponents 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.810
 Percent on how you say you grow in his jobs at Bayer is Berlin 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.289
 maybe the right one in Solschen time to show 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.849
 this and so had succeeded not only in the fifth place space 

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:08.439
 hard on if you as reasonably implement what they cult 

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:09.979
 is planning then 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:11.729
 These will be surprising then 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:13.800
 then almost only that was positive together 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.270
 In Melbourne next weekend's two exciting game first on 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.430
 Saturday in Dresden the Dresden Monarchs 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.719
 the Berlinale and then on Sunday 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:24.759
 in Essen the first in the Karbener it against the Kiel Baltic Hurricanes 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.550
 What we have been looking back on was once again no points from four 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.509
 Members for concern on and return trip 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:34.600
 what altitude Velden the quite good for me for the hospitality 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.830
 and Albus soon at Radio Max Max Goldt
