really<00:01:04.710> just<00:01:04.800> one<00:01:05.070> character<00:01:05.580> but<00:01:05.850> using<00:01:06.119> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
really just one character but using the

took about about four or five hours to
simulate<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.100> scene<00:01:26.400> on<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.909> new<00:01:27.420> workstation

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.240 
simulate this scene on a new workstation
it<00:01:28.080> was<00:01:28.170> under<00:01:28.380> two<00:01:28.560> hours<00:01:28.590> which<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.100> awesome

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
it was under two hours which is awesome

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.070 
it was under two hours which is awesome
on<00:01:29.580> my<00:01:29.700> laptop<00:01:29.909> which<00:01:30.299> was<00:01:30.450> four<00:01:30.659> chords<00:01:30.990> it

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
on my laptop which was four chords it

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.080 
on my laptop which was four chords it
was<00:01:31.170> almost<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.500> whole<00:01:31.680> day<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:32.640> really<00:01:32.790> some

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
was almost a whole day so really some

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.030 
was almost a whole day so really some
awesome<00:01:33.420> performance<00:01:33.840> gains<00:01:34.049> found<00:01:34.770> with<00:01:34.950> the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
awesome performance gains found with the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.340 
awesome performance gains found with the
new<00:01:35.159> hardware<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.700> new<00:01:35.820> CPUs<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.570> what's

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
new hardware the new CPUs and what's

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.170 
new hardware the new CPUs and what's
also<00:01:37.439> great<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:38.009> our<00:01:38.189> software's<00:01:38.670> able<00:01:39.119> to

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
also great is our software's able to

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.550 
also great is our software's able to
take<00:01:39.330> advantage<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.810> them<00:01:39.930> not<00:01:40.140> just<00:01:40.380> at

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
take advantage of them not just at

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.810 
take advantage of them not just at
render<00:01:40.770> time<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.280> lot<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.520> different

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
render time so a lot of different

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.490 
render time so a lot of different
applications<00:01:42.240> out<00:01:42.390> there<00:01:42.420> for<00:01:42.720> doing<00:01:42.869> 3d<00:01:43.140> it's

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
applications out there for doing 3d it's

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.990 
applications out there for doing 3d it's
really<00:01:43.710> great<00:01:43.860> for<00:01:44.070> rendering<00:01:44.369> all<00:01:44.640> your

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
really great for rendering all your

up<00:01:52.409> whether<00:01:53.280> you're<00:01:53.430> simulating<00:01:53.670> whether

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
up whether you're simulating whether

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.819 
up whether you're simulating whether
you're<00:01:54.299> rendering<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:55.290> again<00:01:55.470> here<00:01:55.650> we<00:01:55.740> have

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
you're rendering so again here we have

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.160 
you're rendering so again here we have
this<00:01:55.979> cool<00:01:56.159> little<00:01:56.220> logo<00:01:56.610> coming<00:01:56.820> together

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
this cool little logo coming together

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.969 
this cool little logo coming together
earlier<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.229> was<00:01:58.320> messing<00:01:58.530> around<00:01:58.710> with<00:01:58.950> the

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
earlier I was messing around with the

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.899 
earlier I was messing around with the
Intel<00:01:59.310> logo<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.909> having<00:02:00.540> some<00:02:00.720> fun<00:02:00.930> with<00:02:01.909> with

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
Intel logo and having some fun with with

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.429 
Intel logo and having some fun with with
some<00:02:03.060> particles<00:02:03.509> with<00:02:03.720> some<00:02:03.869> spheres<00:02:04.110> in<00:02:04.350> this

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
some particles with some spheres in this

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.889 
some particles with some spheres in this
case<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:05.280> animation<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.360> logo<00:02:06.689> kind

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
case the animation is the the logo kind

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.590 
case the animation is the the logo kind
of<00:02:06.990> dropping<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.820> that<00:02:08.820> kind<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.060> shattering

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
of dropping and that kind of shattering

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.750 
of dropping and that kind of shattering
and<00:02:09.869> blowing<00:02:10.380> up<00:02:10.500> which<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:10.769> pretty<00:02:10.920> cool<00:02:11.220> and

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
and blowing up which is pretty cool and

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.670 
and blowing up which is pretty cool and
yeah<00:02:12.450> all<00:02:12.660> of<00:02:12.690> this<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:13.079> was<00:02:13.200> actually<00:02:13.320> able<00:02:13.530> to

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
yeah all of this I was actually able to

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.280 
yeah all of this I was actually able to
render<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.130> animation<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:14.820> that<00:02:14.940> five<00:02:15.930> times

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
render the animation of that five times

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.140 
render the animation of that five times
faster<00:02:16.709> using<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.190> render<00:02:17.459> pros<00:02:17.640> over<00:02:17.940> here

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
faster using the render pros over here

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.030 
faster using the render pros over here
and<00:02:18.600> actually<00:02:18.780> if<00:02:18.959> you<00:02:19.019> look<00:02:19.049> over<00:02:19.350> on<00:02:19.500> the

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
and actually if you look over on the

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.330 
and actually if you look over on the
workstation<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.610> my<00:02:20.790> left<00:02:21.030> we<00:02:21.360> have<00:02:22.280> we<00:02:23.280> have

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
workstation to my left we have we have

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.100 
workstation to my left we have we have
the<00:02:23.489> box<00:02:23.610> logo<00:02:23.970> also<00:02:24.420> made<00:02:24.690> up<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.870> bunch<00:02:24.900> of

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
the box logo also made up a bunch of

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.949 
the box logo also made up a bunch of
characters<00:02:25.379> and<00:02:25.800> if<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:26.970> go<00:02:27.239> full<00:02:27.480> screen<00:02:27.720> on

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
characters and if I go full screen on

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.020 
characters and if I go full screen on
the<00:02:28.110> avi<00:02:28.349> here<00:02:31.340> we<00:02:32.340> were<00:02:32.459> actually<00:02:32.580> able<00:02:32.790> to

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
the avi here we were actually able to

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.570 
the avi here we were actually able to
render<00:02:33.330> this<00:02:33.540> five<00:02:34.200> times<00:02:34.230> faster<00:02:35.010> using<00:02:35.370> the

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
render this five times faster using the

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.190 
render this five times faster using the
render<00:02:35.819> pros<00:02:36.030> having<00:02:36.510> five<00:02:36.690> render<00:02:36.989> pros

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
render pros having five render pros

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.990 
render pros having five render pros
which<00:02:37.440> is<00:02:37.560> great<00:02:37.770> so<00:02:38.310> here<00:02:38.459> again<00:02:38.489> you<00:02:38.730> can<00:02:38.849> see

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
which is great so here again you can see

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.729 
which is great so here again you can see
all<00:02:39.030> of<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.390> all<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.200> characters<00:02:40.560> running

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
all of the all the characters running

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.630 
all of the all the characters running
and<00:02:41.690> they<00:02:42.690> will<00:02:42.900> eventually<00:02:43.020> form<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:44.430> cool

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
and they will eventually form the cool

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.309 
and they will eventually form the cool
box<00:02:44.849> logo<00:02:45.150> so<00:02:45.480> this<00:02:45.629> actually<00:02:45.810> took<00:02:46.080> me<00:02:46.230> only

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
box logo so this actually took me only

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.720 
box logo so this actually took me only
about<00:02:46.530> half<00:02:46.770> an<00:02:46.860> hour<00:02:46.950> worth<00:02:47.220> of<00:02:47.310> work<00:02:47.459> maybe

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
about half an hour worth of work maybe

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.190 
about half an hour worth of work maybe
an<00:02:47.849> hour<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.750> give<00:02:48.870> a<00:02:48.900> little<00:02:48.989> bit<00:02:49.110> of

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
an hour to give a little bit of

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.780 
an hour to give a little bit of
fine-tuning<00:02:49.379> let<00:02:50.099> the<00:02:50.190> computer<00:02:50.370> do<00:02:50.640> some

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
fine-tuning let the computer do some

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.150 
fine-tuning let the computer do some
simulation<00:02:51.269> work<00:02:51.450> again<00:02:52.019> we<00:02:52.140> got<00:02:52.260> 16<00:02:52.590> cores<00:02:53.010> in

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
simulation work again we got 16 cores in

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.400 
simulation work again we got 16 cores in
here<00:02:53.280> 32<00:02:53.640> threaded<00:02:54.150> cores<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:55.019> you<00:02:55.140> can<00:02:55.260> see

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
here 32 threaded cores and you can see

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.199 
here 32 threaded cores and you can see
right<00:02:55.440> now<00:02:55.620> they're<00:02:56.069> mostly<00:02:56.190> just<00:02:56.970> kind<00:02:57.150> of

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
right now they're mostly just kind of

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.210 
right now they're mostly just kind of
sitting<00:02:57.420> idle<00:02:57.750> playing<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.110> video<00:02:58.260> back<00:02:58.560> but

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
sitting idle playing the video back but

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.009 
sitting idle playing the video back but
if<00:02:59.310> I<00:02:59.430> if<00:02:59.640> I<00:02:59.790> close<00:03:00.030> this<00:03:00.209> up<00:03:00.269> and<00:03:00.629> let's

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
if I if I close this up and let's

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.809 
if I if I close this up and let's
actually<00:03:01.200> just<00:03:01.470> draw<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:01.950> render<00:03:02.310> region<00:03:02.610> right

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
actually just draw a render region right

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.970 
actually just draw a render region right
here<00:03:02.849> inside<00:03:03.150> our<00:03:03.569> Softimage<00:03:04.319> viewport<00:03:04.800> and

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
here inside our Softimage viewport and

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.220 
here inside our Softimage viewport and
just<00:03:05.459> watch<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.849> rendering<00:03:06.150> performance<00:03:06.480> not

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
just watch the rendering performance not

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.350 
just watch the rendering performance not
amazing<00:03:07.680> see<00:03:08.489> all<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.819> cores<00:03:09.030> are<00:03:09.180> going<00:03:09.300> to
