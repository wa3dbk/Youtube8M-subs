00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.910
 hello the mountains next week is the 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.289
 first advent I do not believe it so 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.000
 I want to go to the ranks of the 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:22.180
 line up cookie becker 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.710
 That's why there is delicious marshmallow today 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.019
 cookies do not just look good 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.740
 taste really damn delicious 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:33.180
 we need to do bitter chocolate 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.710
 butter vanilla sugar baking powder 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.610
 marshmallows that can be monochrome or 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.380
 be colorful 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.180
 my experience is a colored 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:45.160
 but better we need an egg 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:47.800
 sugar salt and flour to first small with 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.720
 coarsely and melt over 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.340
 a water bath 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.350
 it takes a while so we use 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.960
 the time and now halve the 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.880
 marshmallows then when we meet again 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.890
 that chocolate stir every now and then 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.110
 Take a look and then take it when you are 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.059
 Liquid is from the water bath and set 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.220
 put it aside for now we are preparing 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.920
 So batter to give the soft or 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.390
 liquid butter the sugar you put in 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.300
 sugar and I use mine 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.070
 homemade a pinch of salt and 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.670
 then stir with the whisk of the 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.680
 Hearing Aid Everything To A Creamy Mass 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.040
 now we are going to stir that too 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.110
 This complete and add the 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.060
 add liquid chocolate and stir 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.380
 everything to a smooth dough but raises 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.790
 about two tablespoons of the 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.560
 melted chocolate on the 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.870
 we need to decorate later 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.090
 We pour the baking powder into flour 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.530
 have to do both thoroughly with each other and 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.320
 Now give this mixture to 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.640
 prepared dough stir and 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.500
 a dough is enough for that 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.520
 of course you can do that too 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.280
 use hearing aid 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.440
 the dough is finished we prove 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.540
 a baking tray with baking paper and give 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.299
 a large tablespoon of dough 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.760
 I use two spoons for that 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.710
 this works in practice quite well and 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.450
 if we have spread the day bring 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.670
 We spoon it with a slightly 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.290
 round shape then we distribute the 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.119
 halved marshmallows on it and 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.640
 again my note the one colored 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.140
 come visually just better and already 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:16.029
 our cookies come in the oven 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:18.219
 and at 175 degrees around 150 degrees 

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:19.220
 and will be there in just ten to 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:22.400
 twelve minutes 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.140
 ready baked so they should 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.760
 look like sometimes the 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.290
 marshmallows also somewhat unruly 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.790
 and turn up a bit 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.290
 that does not bother and now comes 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.840
 the withheld chocolate for 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.730
 use of these we now distribute 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.220
 pattern and your choice on the surface 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.480
 the cookies and your creativity 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.840
 no limits set here 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.370
 you can see some variations here 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.800
 I think these cookies really look 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.490
 good on the structure of the dough 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.040
 already something 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:52.040
 and not only that you will see wine 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.200
 they are really delicious 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.480
 I wish you a lot of fun baking 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.550
 hope you can do it on the first advent 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.630
 score points and then quite good appetite 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.000
 and if you prefer something else 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.830
 maybe yogurt biscuits 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.050
 I was with his little friend back then 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.760
 hugo or big 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.530
 cookies in american style 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.120
 then just have a look 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.160
 I still have videos to say 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.700
 until next time bye 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.700
 bye Bye
