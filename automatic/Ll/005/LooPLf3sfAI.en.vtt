00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
since they give you an amount of gold

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.850 
since they give you an amount of gold
per<00:01:54.390> turn<00:01:54.570> they<00:01:54.810> give<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.380> think<00:01:55.799> the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
per turn they give you I think the

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.649 
per turn they give you I think the
enormous<00:01:56.219> amount<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.520> traduced<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.329> can<00:01:57.509> have

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
enormous amount of traduced you can have

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.819 
enormous amount of traduced you can have
in<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.869> game<00:01:58.700> with<00:01:59.700> no<00:02:00.140> world<00:02:01.140> wonders<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.649> think

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
in a game with no world wonders I think

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.100 
in a game with no world wonders I think
is<00:02:01.920> eight<00:02:02.159> or<00:02:02.369> nine<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:03.390> double<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:03.990> normal

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
is eight or nine so double the normal

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.350 
is eight or nine so double the normal
number<00:02:04.500> trade<00:02:04.710> ox<00:02:04.860> has<00:02:04.979> 18<00:02:05.579> trade<00:02:05.909> routes<00:02:06.119> and

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
number trade ox has 18 trade routes and

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.779 
number trade ox has 18 trade routes and
some<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.869> them<00:02:06.960> with<00:02:07.649> sun-like<00:02:08.220> bonuses<00:02:08.670> you

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
some of them with sun-like bonuses you

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.609 
some of them with sun-like bonuses you
can<00:02:08.819> make<00:02:09.030> up<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.270> thirty<00:02:09.869> thought<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.319> got<00:02:10.470> to

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
can make up to thirty thought you got to

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.610 
can make up to thirty thought you got to
turn<00:02:10.890> off<00:02:10.950> them<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.760> 18<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.270> 19<00:02:12.629> of<00:02:12.810> those

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
turn off them to 18 and 19 of those

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.589 
turn off them to 18 and 19 of those
that's<00:02:14.250> about<00:02:14.400> someone's<00:02:14.819> on<00:02:14.910> 20<00:02:15.180> gold<00:02:15.420> per

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
that's about someone's on 20 gold per

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.320 
that's about someone's on 20 gold per
turn<00:02:15.840> if<00:02:16.050> your<00:02:16.260> if<00:02:16.410> it's<00:02:16.590> 18<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.069> think<00:02:17.330> that's

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
turn if your if it's 18 I think that's

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.770 
turn if your if it's 18 I think that's
that's<00:02:18.540> amazing<00:02:19.140> so<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:20.190> this<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.150> why<00:02:21.300> for

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
that's amazing so and this is why for

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.300 
that's amazing so and this is why for

culture each turn you could get the
culture<00:03:43.769> but<00:03:44.160> obviously<00:03:44.430> it's<00:03:44.579> under<00:03:44.760> tourism

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
culture but obviously it's under tourism

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.930 
culture but obviously it's under tourism
now<00:03:45.359> so<00:03:46.170> you<00:03:46.920> could<00:03:47.130> get<00:03:47.310> up<00:03:47.430> it's<00:03:47.639> not<00:03:47.850> I

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
now so you could get up it's not I

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.129 
now so you could get up it's not I
wouldn't<00:03:48.150> recommend<00:03:48.389> it<00:03:48.569> as<00:03:48.660> much<00:03:48.810> I<00:03:48.989> would

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
wouldn't recommend it as much I would

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.170 
wouldn't recommend it as much I would
recommend<00:03:49.470> diplomatic<00:03:50.040> then<00:03:50.609> scientific

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
recommend diplomatic then scientific

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.569 
recommend diplomatic then scientific
then<00:03:51.690> culture<00:03:52.109> and<00:03:52.230> last<00:03:52.380> I'd<00:03:52.560> say<00:03:52.590> don't

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
then culture and last I'd say don't

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.000 
then culture and last I'd say don't
don't<00:03:53.970> try<00:03:54.209> and<00:03:54.269> do<00:03:54.359> domination<00:03:54.870> victory

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
don't try and do domination victory

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.289 
don't try and do domination victory
because<00:03:56.010> they'll<00:03:56.190> only<00:03:56.310> have<00:03:56.430> one<00:03:56.880> city<00:03:57.150> where

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
because they'll only have one city where

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:58.729 
because they'll only have one city where
you<00:03:57.359> can<00:03:57.540> produce<00:03:57.690> units<00:03:58.200> you<00:03:58.290> can<00:03:58.500> purchase

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
you can produce units you can purchase

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.610 
you can produce units you can purchase
units<00:03:59.310> yes<00:03:59.549> what<00:03:59.880> densities<00:04:00.269> but<00:04:00.930> you<00:04:01.170> you're

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
units yes what densities but you you're

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.229 
units yes what densities but you you're
not<00:04:01.680> going<00:04:01.859> to<00:04:01.920> make<00:04:02.040> it<00:04:02.190> that<00:04:02.459> much<00:04:02.489> God<00:04:03.030> to<00:04:03.150> be

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
not going to make it that much God to be

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.559 
not going to make it that much God to be
able<00:04:03.359> to<00:04:03.600> purchase<00:04:03.870> your<00:04:04.560> army<00:04:04.889> every<00:04:05.280> term<00:04:05.569> so

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
able to purchase your army every term so

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.110 
able to purchase your army every term so
I<00:04:06.600> highly<00:04:06.989> I<00:04:07.170> would<00:04:07.560> not<00:04:07.739> recommend<00:04:08.120> the

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
I highly I would not recommend the

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.009 
I highly I would not recommend the
domination<00:04:09.450> victory

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
domination victory

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:15.229 
domination victory
so<00:04:10.920> I<00:04:11.220> also<00:04:11.519> go<00:04:11.790> in<00:04:12.000> with<00:04:12.359> their<00:04:12.510> last<00:04:14.239> unit

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
so I also go in with their last unit

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:16.490 
so I also go in with their last unit
which<00:04:15.540> is<00:04:15.720> a<00:04:15.750> great<00:04:16.019> galleons

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
which is a great galleons

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.129 
which is a great galleons
it's<00:04:17.250> a<00:04:17.310> powerful<00:04:17.579> manual<00:04:18.060> unit<00:04:18.329> it's<00:04:18.539> got<00:04:18.870> ten

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
it's a powerful manual unit it's got ten

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.080 
it's a powerful manual unit it's got ten
more<00:04:19.320> production<00:04:19.709> than<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.579> galius<00:04:20.910> it

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
more production than the galius it

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.930 
more production than the galius it
replaces<00:04:21.539> what<00:04:22.530> it's<00:04:23.159> got<00:04:23.340> an<00:04:23.430> extra<00:04:23.669> to

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
replaces what it's got an extra to

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.830 
replaces what it's got an extra to
combat<00:04:24.659> I<00:04:24.690> think<00:04:24.960> and<00:04:25.080> it's<00:04:25.169> got<00:04:25.289> an<00:04:25.349> extra

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
combat I think and it's got an extra

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.030 
combat I think and it's got an extra
or<00:04:25.990> range<00:04:26.230> combat<00:04:26.530> so<00:04:27.130> is<00:04:27.490> very<00:04:27.850> very<00:04:28.330> good<00:04:28.660> and

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
or range combat so is very very good and

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.700 
or range combat so is very very good and
no<00:04:30.040> 16<00:04:30.580> and<00:04:30.790> 17<00:04:31.300> -<00:04:31.600> yeah<00:04:32.110> you<00:04:32.169> get<00:04:32.350> you<00:04:32.530> get

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
no 16 and 17 - yeah you get you get
