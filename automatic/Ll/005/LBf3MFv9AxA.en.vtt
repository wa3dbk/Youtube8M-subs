00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
and I guess the last question is this is

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.590 
and I guess the last question is this is
how<00:03:51.440> do<00:03:51.530> we<00:03:51.590> do<00:03:51.800> it<00:03:51.920> in<00:03:51.980> two<00:03:52.160> minutes<00:03:55.420> we<00:03:56.420> just

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
how do we do it in two minutes we just

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.690 
how do we do it in two minutes we just
start<00:03:56.810> out<00:03:56.930> this<00:03:57.050> one<00:03:57.320> down<00:03:57.620> and<00:03:58.100> then<00:03:58.370> we<00:03:58.550> were

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
start out this one down and then we were

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.570 
start out this one down and then we were
okay<00:03:59.090> so<00:03:59.450> here<00:03:59.989> we<00:04:00.019> have<00:04:00.200> we<00:04:01.010> just<00:04:01.040> hung<00:04:01.400> it

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
okay so here we have we just hung it

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.540 
okay so here we have we just hung it
with<00:04:01.730> some<00:04:02.150> ribbon<00:04:02.390> and<00:04:02.900> a<00:04:03.530> little<00:04:04.040> flower<00:04:04.310> and
