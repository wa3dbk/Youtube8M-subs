know the are the act of friction you
know<00:00:16.619> like<00:00:16.949> when<00:00:17.160> you<00:00:17.279> rub<00:00:17.430> your<00:00:17.520> hands

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
know like when you rub your hands

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.640 
know like when you rub your hands
together<00:00:17.940> things<00:00:18.390> get<00:00:18.600> warm<00:00:18.840> when<00:00:19.080> two<00:00:19.439> pieces

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
together things get warm when two pieces

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.490 
together things get warm when two pieces
of<00:00:19.800> wood<00:00:20.039> rub<00:00:20.279> together<00:00:21.020> creates<00:00:22.020> heat<00:00:22.289> and

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
of wood rub together creates heat and

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.230 
of wood rub together creates heat and
dust<00:00:22.980> also<00:00:23.609> from<00:00:23.820> both<00:00:23.970> pieces<00:00:24.800> so<00:00:26.090> when<00:00:27.090> you

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
dust also from both pieces so when you

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.050 
dust also from both pieces so when you
do<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:27.869> in<00:00:28.170> an<00:00:28.289> artful<00:00:28.680> way<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.310> it's<00:00:29.519> the

do that in an artful way and it's the

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.479 
do that in an artful way and it's the
process<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.599> bow<00:00:30.750> drill<00:00:31.050> using<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.859> string<00:00:32.250> and

everything<00:02:11.500> is<00:02:11.650> so<00:02:11.830> wet<00:02:12.069> there's<00:02:12.340> so<00:02:12.489> much

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
everything is so wet there's so much

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.270

moisture in the air everything is pretty
much<00:02:15.370> saturated<00:02:16.150> so<00:02:16.390> I<00:02:17.379> always<00:02:17.739> advocate<00:02:18.099> when

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
much saturated so I always advocate when

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:19.949 
much saturated so I always advocate when

throughout the day since we're in the
northern<00:03:07.750> hemisphere<00:03:07.870> I<00:03:08.410> get<00:03:09.010> a<00:03:09.040> lot<00:03:09.220> more<00:03:09.250> Sun

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:09.639 
northern hemisphere I get a lot more Sun

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:11.250 
northern hemisphere I get a lot more Sun
and<00:03:09.819> also<00:03:09.940> trees<00:03:10.329> that<00:03:10.510> are<00:03:10.600> on<00:03:10.630> the<00:03:10.810> edges<00:03:10.989> of

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
and also trees that are on the edges of

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.550 
and also trees that are on the edges of
clearings<00:03:11.950> get<00:03:12.850> a<00:03:12.880> lot<00:03:13.060> more<00:03:13.090> Sun<00:03:13.450> as<00:03:13.600> well<00:03:13.780> it

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
clearings get a lot more Sun as well it

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.900 
clearings get a lot more Sun as well it
just<00:03:14.739> would<00:03:14.859> be<00:03:14.889> good<00:03:15.130> for<00:03:15.280> spindle<00:03:15.579> it<00:03:15.730> was

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
just would be good for spindle it was

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:16.830 
just would be good for spindle it was
just<00:03:16.120> really<00:03:16.299> wood

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
just really wood

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.930 
just really wood
so<00:03:17.109> you're<00:03:17.290> carving<00:03:17.620> a<00:03:17.709> bow<00:03:17.829> drill<00:03:17.980> kick<00:03:18.250> one

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
so you're carving a bow drill kick one

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.550 
so you're carving a bow drill kick one
thing<00:03:19.120> is<00:03:19.239> important<00:03:19.690> is<00:03:19.780> to<00:03:19.900> have<00:03:19.930> a<00:03:20.049> spindle

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
thing is important is to have a spindle

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.610 
thing is important is to have a spindle
that's<00:03:20.739> actually<00:03:21.239> round<00:03:22.380> because<00:03:23.380> if<00:03:23.530> you

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
that's actually round because if you

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.559 
that's actually round because if you
have<00:03:23.799> a<00:03:23.829> spindle<00:03:24.160> that<00:03:24.280> has<00:03:24.400> a<00:03:24.430> large<00:03:25.030> jutting

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
have a spindle that has a large jutting

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.210 
have a spindle that has a large jutting
out<00:03:25.660> bump<00:03:25.989> on<00:03:26.200> one<00:03:26.380> side<00:03:26.650> or<00:03:26.799> something<00:03:27.010> it's

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
out bump on one side or something it's

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.580 
out bump on one side or something it's
going<00:03:27.370> to<00:03:27.430> when<00:03:27.819> that<00:03:27.940> bump<00:03:28.239> runs<00:03:28.540> around<00:03:28.690> in<00:03:29.200> a

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
going to when that bump runs around in a

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.690 
going to when that bump runs around in a
circle<00:03:29.829> of<00:03:30.010> course<00:03:30.190> going<00:03:30.340> to<00:03:30.400> create<00:03:30.639> a

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
circle of course going to create a

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.759 
circle of course going to create a
bigger<00:03:30.970> hole<00:03:31.299> than<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:31.930> actual<00:03:32.260> spindle

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
bigger hole than the actual spindle

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.580 
bigger hole than the actual spindle
diameter<00:03:33.310> and<00:03:33.870> that's<00:03:34.870> going<00:03:35.019> to<00:03:35.079> create<00:03:35.230> a

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
diameter and that's going to create a

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.110 
diameter and that's going to create a
looseness<00:03:36.040> there<00:03:36.430> everything<00:03:36.760> with<00:03:36.880> your<00:03:37.000> bow

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
looseness there everything with your bow

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.170 
looseness there everything with your bow
drill<00:03:37.299> K<00:03:37.420> you<00:03:37.480> want<00:03:37.720> it<00:03:37.780> to<00:03:37.870> have<00:03:38.160> a<00:03:39.180> tightness

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
drill K you want it to have a tightness

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.449 
drill K you want it to have a tightness
everything<00:03:41.019> needs<00:03:41.230> to<00:03:41.319> be<00:03:41.440> form-fitting<00:03:42.250> and

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
everything needs to be form-fitting and

everything needs to be form-fitting and
fit<00:03:42.730> just<00:03:42.880> right<00:03:43.030> so<00:03:43.810> you<00:03:43.840> want<00:03:44.049> a<00:03:44.109> round

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
fit just right so you want a round

point<00:03:49.500> reason<00:03:50.500> being<00:03:50.680> is<00:03:50.919> that<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:52.480> top<00:03:52.690> of

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
point reason being is that the top of

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.559 
point reason being is that the top of
the<00:03:52.900> spindle<00:03:53.200> is<00:03:54.150> receiving<00:03:55.150> friction<00:03:55.480> of

the spindle is receiving friction of

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:56.849 
the spindle is receiving friction of
course<00:03:55.780> and<00:03:56.049> the<00:03:56.139> bottom<00:03:56.380> of<00:03:56.440> the<00:03:56.500> spindle<00:03:56.709> is

course and the bottom of the spindle is

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:58.259 
course and the bottom of the spindle is
receiving<00:03:57.220> friction<00:03:57.549> but<00:03:57.669> we<00:03:57.790> don't<00:03:58.060> really

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
receiving friction but we don't really

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.229 
receiving friction but we don't really
want<00:03:58.419> there<00:03:58.959> to<00:03:58.989> be<00:03:59.079> friction<00:03:59.650> at<00:03:59.799> the<00:03:59.829> top

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
want there to be friction at the top

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.330 
want there to be friction at the top
once<00:04:01.239> we<00:04:01.389> burn<00:04:01.720> in<00:04:01.959> and<00:04:02.169> make<00:04:02.410> a<00:04:02.440> good<00:04:02.889> joint

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
once we burn in and make a good joint

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.340 
once we burn in and make a good joint
male-female<00:04:04.209> kind<00:04:04.480> of<00:04:04.540> seat<00:04:04.810> joint<00:04:05.139> between

our handhold and our spindle we no

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:08.969 
our handhold and our spindle we no
longer<00:04:07.720> want<00:04:08.169> there<00:04:08.350> to<00:04:08.380> be<00:04:08.470> friction<00:04:08.889> up

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:08.979 
longer want there to be friction up

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:09.610 
longer want there to be friction up
there<00:04:09.100> that<00:04:09.220> friction

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
there that friction

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.720 
there that friction
is<00:04:09.650> robbing<00:04:10.069> us<00:04:10.220> of<00:04:10.400> energy<00:04:11.000> of<00:04:11.269> speed<00:04:12.220> and<00:04:13.220> so

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
is robbing us of energy of speed and so

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.240 
is robbing us of energy of speed and so
it's<00:04:13.909> just<00:04:14.000> not<00:04:14.500> efficient<00:04:15.500> to<00:04:15.650> have<00:04:15.680> friction

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
it's just not efficient to have friction

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.009 
it's just not efficient to have friction
there<00:04:16.400> so<00:04:16.579> we<00:04:16.699> want<00:04:16.850> that<00:04:16.970> if<00:04:17.359> by<00:04:17.540> carving<00:04:17.959> a

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.689 
there so we want that if by carving a
longer<00:04:18.380> point<00:04:18.620> at<00:04:18.709> the<00:04:18.799> top<00:04:18.979> we're<00:04:19.250> reducing

longer point at the top we're reducing

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:23.409

the<00:04:19.940> amount<00:04:20.269> of<00:04:20.359> surface<00:04:20.750> area<00:04:20.930> that<00:04:21.739> is<00:04:22.419> that

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
the amount of surface area that is that

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.140 
the amount of surface area that is that
is<00:04:23.540> meeting<00:04:23.780> at<00:04:24.080> the<00:04:24.260> handhold<00:04:25.150> spindle

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.990 
is meeting at the handhold spindle
Junction<00:04:26.870> and<00:04:27.020> that<00:04:27.860> reduced<00:04:28.460> surface<00:04:28.790> area

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
Junction and that reduced surface area

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.909 
Junction and that reduced surface area
reduces<00:04:29.419> the<00:04:29.540> friction<00:04:29.750> we<00:04:30.320> also<00:04:30.500> will<00:04:30.770> then

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
reduces the friction we also will then

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.090 
reduces the friction we also will then
lubricate<00:04:31.520> that<00:04:31.750> joint<00:04:32.750> once<00:04:33.050> we<00:04:33.229> are<00:04:33.830> sure

lubricate that joint once we are sure

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.210 
our spindle in and at the bottom of the
spindle<00:04:40.310> will<00:04:40.490> carve<00:04:40.669> a<00:04:40.760> much<00:04:41.770> duller<00:04:42.770> point

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
spindle will carve a much duller point

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.370 
spindle will carve a much duller point
and<00:04:43.460> that<00:04:43.880> point<00:04:43.910> will<00:04:44.570> allow<00:04:44.840> us<00:04:45.080> to<00:04:45.110> get

and that point will allow us to get

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.939 
and that point will allow us to get
started<00:04:45.979> so<00:04:46.220> as<00:04:46.789> we<00:04:47.419> take<00:04:48.260> our<00:04:48.470> fire<00:04:48.740> board

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949 
started so as we take our fire board

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:50.200 
started so as we take our fire board
we'll<00:04:49.100> make<00:04:49.250> like<00:04:49.430> a<00:04:49.550> little<00:04:49.789> hole<00:04:49.970> in<00:04:50.000> the

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
we'll make like a little hole in the

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.210 
we'll make like a little hole in the
fire<00:04:50.419> board<00:04:50.690> a<00:04:50.960> little<00:04:51.560> dent<00:04:51.830> in<00:04:51.919> the<00:04:52.010> fire

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:54.199 
board and that dollar point will then go

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:55.420

into<00:04:54.229> that<00:04:54.590> little<00:04:54.740> hole<00:04:54.860> that<00:04:55.160> we've<00:04:55.250> made

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
into that little hole that we've made

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.140 
into that little hole that we've made
with<00:04:55.550> our<00:04:55.580> knife<00:04:55.850> and<00:04:56.979> we'll<00:04:57.979> start<00:04:58.430> to<00:04:58.580> create

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
with our knife and we'll start to create

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.080 
with our knife and we'll start to create
a<00:04:59.770> spot<00:05:00.770> for<00:05:01.010> the<00:05:01.130> spindle<00:05:01.460> to<00:05:01.520> begin<00:05:01.760> to<00:05:01.910> burn

a spot for the spindle to begin to burn

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.960 
a spot for the spindle to begin to burn
so<00:05:02.720> as<00:05:02.870> the<00:05:03.020> spindle<00:05:03.260> begins<00:05:03.590> to<00:05:03.740> burn<00:05:03.949> it<00:05:04.760> will

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
so as the spindle begins to burn it will

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.990 
so as the spindle begins to burn it will
create<00:05:05.300> naturally<00:05:06.020> create<00:05:06.440> an<00:05:07.400> indention<00:05:07.760> in

we<00:05:25.099> hadn't<00:05:25.400> already<00:05:25.430> done<00:05:25.610> that<00:05:25.970> and<00:05:26.240> then<00:05:26.930> the

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
we hadn't already done that and then the

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.110 
we hadn't already done that and then the
notch<00:05:27.650> in<00:05:27.830> the<00:05:27.919> fire<00:05:28.099> board<00:05:28.340> really<00:05:28.639> provides

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
notch in the fire board really provides

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.240 
notch in the fire board really provides
a<00:05:29.270> spot<00:05:29.599> for<00:05:29.810> the<00:05:29.870> dust<00:05:30.080> to<00:05:30.260> go<00:05:30.530> so<00:05:31.099> if<00:05:31.160> you

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
a spot for the dust to go so if you

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.589 
a spot for the dust to go so if you
don't<00:05:31.430> create<00:05:31.610> a<00:05:31.729> notch<00:05:31.880> in<00:05:32.030> the<00:05:32.120> fire<00:05:32.330> board

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:32.599 
don't create a notch in the fire board

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:34.029 
don't create a notch in the fire board
the<00:05:32.930> hot<00:05:33.110> part<00:05:33.320> of<00:05:33.410> the<00:05:33.470> spindle<00:05:33.770> is<00:05:33.860> not

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039 
the hot part of the spindle is not

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:35.770 
the hot part of the spindle is not
contacting<00:05:34.700> the<00:05:34.789> dust<00:05:35.000> since<00:05:35.270> the<00:05:35.389> dust<00:05:35.630> is

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
contacting the dust since the dust is

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.540 
contacting the dust since the dust is
building<00:05:36.169> up<00:05:36.289> around<00:05:36.410> the<00:05:36.710> outside<00:05:37.099> the<00:05:37.370> dust

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
building up around the outside the dust

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:38.710 
building up around the outside the dust
has<00:05:37.639> got<00:05:37.789> to<00:05:37.880> go<00:05:37.970> somewhere<00:05:38.240> and<00:05:38.510> so<00:05:38.599> it's

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
has got to go somewhere and so it's

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.659 
has got to go somewhere and so it's
being<00:05:38.870> pushed<00:05:39.139> up<00:05:39.289> the<00:05:39.349> outside<00:05:39.830> and<00:05:40.550> it's

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
being pushed up the outside and it's

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:42.040 
being pushed up the outside and it's
gathering<00:05:41.270> around<00:05:41.360> the<00:05:41.570> outside<00:05:41.900> of<00:05:41.990> the

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
gathering around the outside of the

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.839 
gathering around the outside of the
spindle<00:05:42.320> not<00:05:42.620> contacting<00:05:43.250> the<00:05:43.340> hot<00:05:43.490> part<00:05:43.699> and

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:43.849 
spindle not contacting the hot part and

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:46.300 
spindle not contacting the hot part and
spindle<00:05:44.180> so<00:05:44.660> by<00:05:44.780> carving<00:05:45.199> a<00:05:45.320> notch<00:05:45.500> we<00:05:46.130> allow

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
spindle so by carving a notch we allow

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.850 
spindle so by carving a notch we allow
the<00:05:46.370> dust<00:05:46.699> a<00:05:46.849> spot<00:05:47.150> to<00:05:47.360> fall<00:05:47.599> into<00:05:47.840> and<00:05:48.289> then

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
the dust a spot to fall into and then

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.740 
the dust a spot to fall into and then
the<00:05:48.979> spindle<00:05:49.430> is<00:05:49.610> then<00:05:50.000> the<00:05:50.360> end<00:05:50.539> of<00:05:50.690> the

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
the spindle is then the end of the

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.750 
the spindle is then the end of the
spindle<00:05:50.960> is<00:05:51.349> denn<00:05:51.590> and<00:05:51.770> direct<00:05:52.130> contact<00:05:52.340> with

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
spindle is denn and direct contact with

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.510 
spindle is denn and direct contact with
the<00:05:53.150> dust<00:05:53.510> as<00:05:53.750> the<00:05:54.500> dust<00:05:54.770> builds<00:05:55.160> up<00:05:55.280> in<00:05:55.430> the

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
the dust as the dust builds up in the

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.900 
the dust as the dust builds up in the
knotch

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
knotch

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.779 
knotch
so<00:05:56.330> once<00:05:56.539> that<00:05:56.599> happens<00:05:57.139> we<00:05:58.010> increase<00:05:58.490> our

00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:58.789 
so once that happens we increase our

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:02.200 
so once that happens we increase our
pressure<00:05:59.599> and<00:05:59.960> our<00:06:00.050> speed<00:06:00.729> sometimes<00:06:01.729> just

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
pressure and our speed sometimes just

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.510 
pressure and our speed sometimes just
increase<00:06:02.570> speed<00:06:02.900> not<00:06:03.620> pressure<00:06:03.919> depending<00:06:04.400> on

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
increase speed not pressure depending on

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.310 
increase speed not pressure depending on
what<00:06:04.849> type<00:06:05.060> of<00:06:05.090> material<00:06:05.750> we<00:06:05.780> are<00:06:05.840> using<00:06:05.900> and

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:06.320 
what type of material we are using and

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.350 
what type of material we are using and
heat<00:06:06.979> that<00:06:07.010> spindle<00:06:07.550> up<00:06:07.639> as<00:06:07.760> hot<00:06:07.940> as<00:06:08.090> we<00:06:08.120> can

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
heat that spindle up as hot as we can

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.159 
heat that spindle up as hot as we can
get<00:06:08.539> it

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:09.169 
get it

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:10.900 
get it
kind<00:06:09.620> of<00:06:09.650> a<00:06:09.740> magical<00:06:10.190> temperature<00:06:10.669> that's

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:10.910 
kind of a magical temperature that's

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.730 
kind of a magical temperature that's
often<00:06:11.180> thrown<00:06:11.419> around<00:06:11.539> is<00:06:11.720> 800<00:06:12.139> degrees<00:06:12.440> not

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
often thrown around is 800 degrees not

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.670 
often thrown around is 800 degrees not
really<00:06:13.070> that<00:06:13.280> that's<00:06:13.550> that<00:06:13.729> important<00:06:14.680> but

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 
really that that's that important but

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.950 
really that that's that important but
that's<00:06:16.250> the<00:06:16.520> temperature<00:06:17.090> which<00:06:17.330> the<00:06:17.659> dust

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
that's the temperature which the dust

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.930 
that's the temperature which the dust
will<00:06:18.229> then<00:06:18.380> kind<00:06:18.650> of<00:06:18.710> ignite<00:06:19.159> and<00:06:19.460> it<00:06:19.789> won't

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
will then kind of ignite and it won't

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.820 
will then kind of ignite and it won't
ignite<00:06:20.300> in<00:06:20.539> the<00:06:20.570> form<00:06:21.169> that<00:06:21.260> most<00:06:21.560> people

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
ignite in the form that most people

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:22.830 
ignite in the form that most people
think<00:06:22.010> of<00:06:22.159> as<00:06:22.340> a<00:06:22.370> fire

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 
think of as a fire

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.689 
think of as a fire
it<00:06:22.930> will<00:06:23.050> create<00:06:23.350> a<00:06:23.440> small<00:06:23.830> ember<00:06:24.280> that's<00:06:24.490> very

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:24.699 
it will create a small ember that's very

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:27.590 
it will create a small ember that's very
delicate<00:06:24.910> and<00:06:25.330> then<00:06:25.449> we'll<00:06:25.570> put<00:06:25.810> that<00:06:25.990> into<00:06:26.430> a

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 
delicate and then we'll put that into a

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.439 
delicate and then we'll put that into a
fluff<00:06:28.600> tup<00:06:29.070> like<00:06:30.070> bark<00:06:30.490> bundle<00:06:31.000> something

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:31.449 
fluff tup like bark bundle something

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:33.600 
fluff tup like bark bundle something
that<00:06:31.570> might<00:06:31.750> resemble<00:06:32.260> a<00:06:32.560> small<00:06:32.860> bird's<00:06:33.100> nest

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:33.610 
that might resemble a small bird's nest

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.890 
that might resemble a small bird's nest
something<00:06:34.360> really<00:06:34.600> fluffy<00:06:35.110> and<00:06:35.919> fine-grained

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
something really fluffy and fine-grained

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.020 
something really fluffy and fine-grained
inner<00:06:37.900> bark<00:06:38.199> works<00:06:38.530> really<00:06:38.770> well<00:06:38.979> we'll<00:06:39.910> put

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
inner bark works really well we'll put

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.820 
inner bark works really well we'll put
that<00:06:40.150> in<00:06:40.330> there<00:06:40.510> and<00:06:40.690> then<00:06:40.810> that<00:06:40.990> little<00:06:41.470> coal

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:41.830 
that in there and then that little coal

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.439 
that in there and then that little coal
will<00:06:42.070> begin<00:06:42.280> to<00:06:42.430> start<00:06:42.669> to<00:06:42.699> burn<00:06:42.940> that<00:06:43.120> bark

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:43.449 
will begin to start to burn that bark

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:45.810 
will begin to start to burn that bark
and<00:06:43.660> that<00:06:43.780> bark<00:06:44.080> and<00:06:44.290> turn<00:06:44.530> when<00:06:44.770> given<00:06:45.100> oxygen

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:45.820 
and that bark and turn when given oxygen

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.360 
and that bark and turn when given oxygen
through<00:06:46.120> our<00:06:46.360> breath<00:06:46.630> will<00:06:47.320> blow<00:06:47.860> up<00:06:48.040> into<00:06:48.340> a

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:48.370 
through our breath will blow up into a

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.640 
through our breath will blow up into a
flame<00:06:49.030> and<00:06:49.600> then<00:06:49.690> we'll<00:06:49.810> add<00:06:50.020> our<00:06:50.050> sticks<00:06:50.470> onto

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:50.650 
flame and then we'll add our sticks onto

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.770 
flame and then we'll add our sticks onto
that<00:06:50.800> to<00:06:50.979> build<00:06:51.130> our<00:06:51.250> fire<00:06:51.430> in<00:06:52.060> my<00:06:52.300> own<00:06:52.449> view

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:52.780 
that to build our fire in my own view

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.810 
that to build our fire in my own view
the<00:06:53.139> reason<00:06:53.410> I<00:06:53.530> practice<00:06:53.949> these<00:06:54.040> skills<00:06:54.100> is<00:06:54.639> I

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:54.820 
the reason I practice these skills is I

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.600 
the reason I practice these skills is I
really<00:06:55.210> for<00:06:55.450> one<00:06:55.630> appreciate<00:06:56.160> the<00:06:57.160> connection

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:57.610 
really for one appreciate the connection

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.520 
really for one appreciate the connection
that<00:06:57.669> it<00:06:57.790> gives<00:06:57.940> me<00:06:58.030> the<00:06:58.090> landscape<00:06:58.840> I<00:06:59.080> mean

00:06:59.520 --> 00:06:59.530 
that it gives me the landscape I mean

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.050 
that it gives me the landscape I mean
you<00:06:59.710> might<00:06:59.889> think<00:07:00.130> of<00:07:00.250> bow<00:07:00.400> drill<00:07:00.639> only<00:07:00.820> as

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:01.060 
you might think of bow drill only as
