00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.570
 Hello and welcome to here 

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:07.120
 Ebay lay in this video I will tell you 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.679
 Introducing the new iphone 5 s 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.870
 we have it here in a column 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:13.709
 version with 16 gb 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.709
 have fun 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.699
 At the beginning, we will take it out of the iphone 5 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.009
 we give the packaging out 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.010
 then the transport box to the side and 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.640
 dedicate ourselves to the actual unboxing of the 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.640
 equipment 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:47.620
 we take our unboxing knife 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.610
 Carefully the foil from now we see it 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.600
 in slow round 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.910
 and then when we get the whole one full 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.239
 we will have the 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.370
 take a closer look at the packaging 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:04.360
 I see in front we have an image of 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:06.729
 new iphone 5 ios 7 look in the 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.700
 page areas we see an iphone 5 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:14.229
 put it on pressure and on the back 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:16.240
 few useful hints to the and 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.550
 presses surfaces of the packaging we see 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.160
 AppLocker still exist 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.940
 gold held 30 and the golden version 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.940
 the iphones to 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.609
 Next, we will cover the 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.619
 carefully pick up 

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:34.960
 and, first of all, that brings you that 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.759
 iphone 5 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.899
 as the packaging is very simple and 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.840
 kept simple 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:45.289
 everything you see after opening is 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.820
 the device itself we can do the iphone 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:52.890
 now just lift it out 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:55.540
 and we can get the whole device 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:00.400
 on the back we see the big one 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:03.340
 golden surface and on the front 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.280
 the new tab are therefore golden ring 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.050
 All around on the side we see each other 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.709
 the same stayed a golden one 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.240
 colour 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:15.270
 but we still have that 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:18.459
 volume control and the soundless button 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.950
 Downstairs we still have the headphones 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.290
 input speaker and the lightning 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.620
 connection and on the other side 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.690
 we still see the nano 7 slot and 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.300
 on the top we see one more 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.910
 button to lock and unlock the 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.860
 device on the back as I said the 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.130
 big golden area with small white ones 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.739
 and there we already see the new lightning 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.390
 the one with the cold and something denial 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.280
 Behind this you are in ours 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.519
 next again with the iphone 5 1 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.290
 Review Now we go to the iphone but to 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.330
 side and see what else in the 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.580
 Packaging is everything we do 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.709
 must pull on this lug and 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.130
 already we can put this envelope upwards 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.040
 pull 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.120
 and when we see it open in Cuba 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.950
 we first open the nanos in the slot 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.730
 In order to gain access to services 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.420
 the middle east 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.519
 We still have a few companies 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:19.310
 The guides help the gentlemen 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:20.930
 and of course the stickers so then 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.780
 we still have it here in the packaging 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.569
 you clean them here in one 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.569
 practical transport box to help you 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.610
 can take you everywhere 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.390
 then we have the one here 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.030
 network-character 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.260
 so that one can charge the iphone if 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.299
 you do not have a computer nearby 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.810
 and of course the lightning on usb 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.810
 electric wire 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:53.290
 and next we will film 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:55.770
 Mr. first give the front then the 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.770
 behind 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.800
 something like this at a unboxing course 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:12.090
 not to be missed is the first 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.090
 start of the device 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.120
 because first comes the app citizen and there 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.130
 it is be a white iphone 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.109
 The background is white and the apple 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.960
 kept black while sleeping exactly 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.680
 reversed in the background series runs the 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.480
 countdown 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.000
 We want to see how long that is 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.430
 first start of the iphones needs and 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.290
 for his are incredibly fast 20 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.390
 seconds 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.710
 At first we are directed to the menu and 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:41.250
 language 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:43.620
 then we have a wlan network world 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.250
 and next is the sim card 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.800
 required 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.830
 a nano theme is required here 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:56.550
 as with the one at his provider 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:05:00.000
 you have to buy so you lie at the sim 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:07.680
 slot in and you can with the 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:10.020
 next step away the next 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.300
 step in the menu is the activation of the 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.700
 iphones this can take a few minutes 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.620
 But it usually goes pretty fast then 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.150
 you can activate the location services 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.830
 and configure the iphone 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.560
 Next, you have the apple id 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.669
 Enter and conditions of use of 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.669
 accept apple 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:36.420
 the next step in the configuration 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:40.250
 the iphones is icloud then you can call 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:41.940
 activate my iphone search and 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:49.350
 Finally it comes to 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:52.740
 set up the dacia this will be one 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:55.290
 The assistant called the one by the 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.970
 configuration leads you then lays down 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:00.110
 just finger your finger several times 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:03.810
 different positions on the sensor 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:07.010
 and the software gradually recognizes 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.010
 your fingerprint 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:21.180
 You can then save some fingers 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:23.100
 so that you can do it with several fingers or 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:26.150
 several people on the iphone 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.150
 can access 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.639
 and if you succeed then 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:36.790
 has managed to get to the code 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:38.979
 Enter this as intended if you 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:41.080
 do not use the fingerprint sensor 

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:42.449
 could and still do 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.710
 access iphone 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:47.560
 then you can but that the device at 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:49.870
 register apple and off you go 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.520
 I hope you liked the video 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:53.770

 we are closer to iphone of fans under the 

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:01.289
 take a magnifying glass
