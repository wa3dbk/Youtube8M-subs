attach this camera to well the one thing
I<00:01:16.049> never<00:01:16.229> really<00:01:16.530> mentioned<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.009> when<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.280> go

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
I never really mentioned is when you go

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.249 
I never really mentioned is when you go
over<00:01:17.610> bumps<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.090> stuff<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.539> battery<00:01:18.899> kind<00:01:19.170> of

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
over bumps and stuff the battery kind of

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.820 
over bumps and stuff the battery kind of
rattles<00:01:19.560> around<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.979> lot<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.340> back<00:01:20.550> and<00:01:20.940> I

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
rattles around a lot in the back and I

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.430 
rattles around a lot in the back and I
imagine<00:01:22.830> there's<00:01:23.009> some<00:01:23.310> ways<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.330> making<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.350> a

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
imagine there's some ways of making it a

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.590 
imagine there's some ways of making it a
little<00:01:25.530> more<00:01:25.770> quiet<00:01:26.100> but<00:01:26.460> it's<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.450> little

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
that whirring noise and then we'll pedal

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.300 
that whirring noise and then we'll pedal
some<00:02:30.510> more

for<00:03:08.720> about<00:03:09.010> $1,600<00:03:10.010> this<00:03:10.610> one's<00:03:10.849> got<00:03:11.060> the

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
for about $1,600 this one's got the

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.559

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
is all downhill for quite a ways I'm not

is all downhill for quite a ways I'm not
really<00:03:23.569> going<00:03:23.690> to<00:03:23.750> record<00:03:24.049> the<00:03:24.260> sounds<00:03:24.590> until

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
really going to record the sounds until

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.110 
really going to record the sounds until
we<00:03:24.980> get<00:03:25.069> a<00:03:25.129> little<00:03:25.280> bit<00:03:25.430> further<00:03:25.670> along<00:03:25.819> when

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
we get a little bit further along when

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.849 
we get a little bit further along when
we're<00:03:26.239> going<00:03:26.359> uphill<00:03:26.629> makes<00:03:27.260> more<00:03:27.440> noise<00:03:27.500> that

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
we're going uphill makes more noise that

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:28.119 
we're going uphill makes more noise that
way

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129 
way

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:29.289

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
because I'm on this bike it doesn't like

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.710 
because I'm on this bike it doesn't like
to<00:03:47.690> go<00:03:47.810> backwards<00:03:48.169> when<00:03:48.319> it's<00:03:48.470> turned<00:03:48.680> off<00:03:49.720> so

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
to go backwards when it's turned off so

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.780 
to go backwards when it's turned off so
we're<00:03:51.560> at<00:03:51.680> a<00:03:51.709> little<00:03:51.859> stretch<00:03:52.220> here<00:03:52.250> that<00:03:52.639> goes

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
we're at a little stretch here that goes

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.009 
we're at a little stretch here that goes
slightly<00:03:53.060> uphill<00:03:55.389> I'm<00:03:56.389> gonna<00:03:56.569> put<00:03:56.750> this<00:03:56.840> thing

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
slightly uphill I'm gonna put this thing

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.539 
slightly uphill I'm gonna put this thing
on<00:03:57.139> sport<00:03:57.560> mode<00:03:57.739> so<00:03:57.980> it's<00:03:58.099> going<00:03:58.220> to<00:03:58.280> be<00:03:58.430> the

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
on sport mode so it's going to be the

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.819 
on sport mode so it's going to be the
brightest<00:03:58.940> I<00:03:59.389> mean<00:04:00.200> you<00:04:00.500> know<00:04:00.620> the<00:04:00.709> most

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
brightest I mean you know the most

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:04.089 
brightest I mean you know the most
powerful<00:04:01.340> I'm<00:04:02.209> more<00:04:02.480> push<00:04:02.889> those<00:04:03.889> lights

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
powerful I'm more push those lights

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:05.589 
powerful I'm more push those lights
don't<00:04:04.310> flicker<00:04:04.639> the<00:04:04.730> camera<00:04:05.150> just<00:04:05.269> makes<00:04:05.510> it

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
don't flicker the camera just makes it

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.890 
don't flicker the camera just makes it
look<00:04:05.720> like<00:04:05.930> they<00:04:06.049> do<00:04:07.209> and<00:04:08.209> I'll<00:04:08.569> try<00:04:08.750> to<00:04:08.780> be

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
look like they do and I'll try to be

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:09.400 
look like they do and I'll try to be
quiet

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
quiet

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.190 
quiet
just<00:04:10.040> so<00:04:10.130> that<00:04:10.250> you<00:04:10.370> can<00:04:10.519> listen<00:04:10.849> to<00:04:10.910> the<00:04:11.000> motor

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
just so that you can listen to the motor

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.680 
just so that you can listen to the motor
start<00:04:12.200> off<00:04:12.319> in<00:04:12.590> seventh<00:04:13.120> which<00:04:14.120> is<00:04:14.299> of<00:04:14.510> course

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
start off in seventh which is of course

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.229 
start off in seventh which is of course
going<00:04:14.840> to<00:04:14.989> be<00:04:15.049> the<00:04:15.230> roughest<00:04:15.590> gear<00:04:16.239> hopefully

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
going to be the roughest gear hopefully

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.270 
going to be the roughest gear hopefully
make<00:04:17.389> that<00:04:17.599> guy<00:04:17.720> make<00:04:17.930> the<00:04:18.049> most<00:04:18.229> noise<00:04:18.320> so<00:04:19.190> you

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
make that guy make the most noise so you

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.349 
make that guy make the most noise so you
can<00:04:19.400> hear<00:04:19.519> what<00:04:19.609> it<00:04:19.700> sounds<00:04:19.940> like<00:04:19.970> and<00:04:20.269> we're

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
can hear what it sounds like and we're

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.250 
can hear what it sounds like and we're
going<00:04:20.479> to<00:04:20.539> go<00:04:20.630> up<00:04:20.750> this<00:04:20.900> slight<00:04:21.169> little<00:04:21.380> grade

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
going to go up this slight little grade

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:37.770 
going to go up this slight little grade
ready<00:04:24.260> set<00:04:24.530> go

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:53.490 

slow<00:04:38.780> down<00:04:38.960> a<00:04:39.020> bit<00:04:39.340> kick<00:04:40.340> off<00:04:40.520> again

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.719 

increases<00:04:54.500> in<00:04:54.530> power<00:04:54.889> the<00:04:55.250> harder<00:04:55.610> you

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
increases in power the harder you

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:56.409 
increases in power the harder you

if<00:04:56.990> you<00:04:57.139> pedal<00:04:57.530> light<00:04:57.710> it<00:04:57.919> gives<00:04:58.069> you<00:04:58.219> light

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
if you pedal light it gives you light

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.409 
if you pedal light it gives you light
like<00:05:00.110> this<00:05:00.610> but<00:05:01.610> it<00:05:01.729> doesn't<00:05:01.879> make<00:05:02.030> my<00:05:02.180> choice

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
like this but it doesn't make my choice

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.110 
like this but it doesn't make my choice
at<00:05:02.659> all<00:05:02.780> of<00:05:02.930> course<00:05:03.520> we<00:05:04.520> do<00:05:04.669> it<00:05:04.789> a<00:05:04.819> little<00:05:04.969> bit

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
at all of course we do it a little bit

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.620 
at all of course we do it a little bit
more<00:05:05.300> pedal
