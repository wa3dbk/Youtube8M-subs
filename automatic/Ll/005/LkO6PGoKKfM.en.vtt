one
though<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.819> first<00:02:44.000> will<00:02:44.239> be<00:02:44.269> in<00:02:44.510> time<00:02:44.719> and

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049

there's one gone here to start the

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.420 
there's one gone here to start the
second<00:02:47.260> you<00:02:48.260> know<00:02:48.349> you<00:02:48.409> always<00:02:48.709> worry<00:02:49.159> about

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
second you know you always worry about

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.160 
second you know you always worry about
the<00:02:49.549> pitcher<00:02:49.879> in<00:02:50.000> this<00:02:50.090> situation<00:02:50.719> like<00:02:50.900> this

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
the pitcher in this situation like this

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.050 
the pitcher in this situation like this
because<00:02:51.799> he's<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.189> closest<00:02:52.700> one<00:02:52.909> to<00:02:53.030> the

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
because he's the closest one to the

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.240 
because he's the closest one to the
action<00:02:53.540> so<00:02:54.019> of<00:02:54.140> course<00:02:54.379> he<00:02:54.709> has<00:02:54.799> the<00:02:54.829> least

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
action so of course he has the least

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.949 
action so of course he has the least
amount<00:02:55.459> of<00:02:55.670> time<00:02:55.879> to<00:02:56.030> dodge<00:02:56.209> anything<00:02:56.659> that

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
amount of time to dodge anything that

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.140 
amount of time to dodge anything that
comes<00:02:57.140> his<00:02:57.319> way<00:02:57.379> but<00:02:58.159> he<00:02:58.219> concentrates<00:02:58.939> well

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
comes his way but he concentrates well

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.449 
comes his way but he concentrates well
enough<00:02:59.420> to<00:02:59.750> get<00:02:59.959> the<00:03:00.140> baseball<00:03:00.379> and<00:03:00.920> throw<00:03:01.340> the
