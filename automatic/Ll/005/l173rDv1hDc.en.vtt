00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 and fast the position was a society 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.720
 very united to the truth that decisions 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.389
 of one were the decisions but one 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.400
 has let's say the singer in certain 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.400
 situation is a business decision 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.220
 and I always have also put the 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.240
 back on things on things that could not 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.099
 have assumed it as it has also assumed 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.170
 when I got myself up against 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.630
 someone also calls nobody will 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.730
 taken as part of the problem today 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.730
 I could share a meal 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.579
 the truth that the group of friends 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.160
 holding the know-how or tenÃ©s 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.890
 friends in the distance exist I do not know if 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.280
 We are friends with Jorge but I understand that 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.700
 we understand more or less 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.160
 and I think there is a love 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.579
 with marchena I do not know if I really like 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.289
 nice and he 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.540
 and the truth that he has that ability 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:06.520
 as I also recognize that every time 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.409
 we tried we tried to see if 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.049
 we could have a relationship beyond 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.880
 all air just jump quickly and 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.950
 believes that conciliatory attitude 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.420
 let's say we 've told you what I had or 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.619
 a posture of a little seems valid 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.060
 reference were on the other side of the 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.710
 vividness that he has regarding the 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.090
 politics not everything in their relationships 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:27.549
 personal in the recording of thousand 991 yo 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.200
 I'm not even going of 2000 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.250
 changing, I think it has changed 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.770
 much 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.600
 opens has corrected some things other 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.549
 that at least can correct them the same 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.479
 it happens to me I guess the more 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:43.420
 great we build by doing the two I 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.959
 I think one gets more bastard 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.959
 three or four 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.909
 there are people who become more resentful and 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:54.220
 more cabrona 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:57.630
 and that's good we'll never be 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.630
 talking and everyone 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.010
 there are people in this case where I 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.180
 I understand and he understands that we're going 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.729
 changing and that the relationship 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.770
 undoubtedly it has been decompressed a lot 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:16.470
 and I really think it's different 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:20.310
 also television and television and that 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:23.040
 normally something is going to break but that 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.319
 neither would I do it now if you tell me you 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:30.650
 like the programs are still 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:32.730
 basically a television than me is 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.350
 undoubtedly a lot of people see it 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.350
 and it lasts in time 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:54.810
 the children not because we would say 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.540
 recommended let's say another kind of attitude 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.239
 but one enters to read through the 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.250
 attitudes the messages the kids say 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.010
 other maturations let's say in what 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.650
 personal 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.470
 and that's what the combo is filling 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.180
 everyone is changing 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.620
 there are things that you have to justify 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.140
 accreditation that you can also have 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:19.069
 that keep not jorge 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.069
 and it's a company 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:29.170
 otherwise there are more changes before the 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.420
 publicly you leave and undoubtedly 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.150
 you have to handle yourself in a way and 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.310
 until rondo shots by the side of the 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.500
 children that really on the other hand is 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.670
 total on the other side are the values 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:45.819
 who defend women who believe that 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:52.360
 those people are changing with the 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:55.360
 run but if you're not to look 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.670
 accomplice complicates everything louis does 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.860
 little bit 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.390
 and they change you good is the same guy that 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.720
 will have been in another magazine in a thousand 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.720
 nine 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:18.669
 one thing that had not happened to all 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.290
 we have discovered both the 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.710
 time to say ah and this direct results 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.020
 and 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.650
 and it turns out this being this we change 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.650
 say so 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.560
 as we do with later over time 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:36.080
 what you will do there are people that you have 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.400
 sparks that within the love that 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.400
 has is that the spark is not 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.130
 also day 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.770
 and of course the asshole saved her from them 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.770
 kill on a ladder 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.250
 memory
