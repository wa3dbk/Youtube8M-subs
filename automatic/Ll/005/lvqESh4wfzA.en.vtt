00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.710
 I'm going to teach you how to make a makeup 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.350
 to highlight both green eyes and 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.840
 celestial eyes this is a makeup that 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.000
 it takes us to great delineated but if 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.160
 the shading over is intensified 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.840
 everything in the lower eyelid what does 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.840
 it is just that the color is highlighted 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.840
 let's start by placing the pigment 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.120
 Mac copper in this case is a 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.490
 pigment that is pressed and we're going 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.240
 to place with a brush blander on 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.240
 all the eyelid mobile 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.910
 let's use the same brush without 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.620
 load more product to pass it on 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.740
 the lower eyelid to create a 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.990
 thick shading 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.660
 to give light to the look we are going to take 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:49.160
 the shadow both lights of mac and we're going 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.160
 to place in the center of the eye 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.800
 to give more framework to the look we are going to 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:01.250
 Take espresso and a flat brush in this 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.830
 case is 239 max and we are going to place it 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.940
 at the end of the eye trying to form 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.940
 a short bird 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.590
 to illuminate the superciliary arch since 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:21.690
 we do not want to put too much brightness 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:24.270
 let's use the young tone of mac 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.790
 to delineate the eye let's use the 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.210
 mac powerpoint in this case in tone 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.010
 This is a green tracer tone the moss 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.500
 which will not be as intense as the 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.320
 black and we're going to put it on the line 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.980
 of eye water in the upper eyelid and 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.980
 in the lower eyelid 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.219
 to use false eyelashes the 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.560
 of mac in black tone which give a 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:55.780
 effect of longer eyelashes and more 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.490
 separated to the best style lashes 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.580
 false 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.290
 16 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.260
 to perform the contour of the face 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.600
 we're going to use both mac and a 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.420
 brush at an angle and this we are going to 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.460
 place under the cheek bone 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.160
 before the proofreader we will use a 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.310
 illuminator to give more light below the 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.310
 eye 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.970
 all right 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.780
 then we will use a concealer to 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.770
 cover whatever darkness they have 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.770
 under the dark circles 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.330
 to fix the concealer and illuminator 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.790
 that we just put in let's take the 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.790
 mineral ice infinite natural of mac 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:54.160
 then we take the grid and without light by 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.830
 mack in silver gas tone and we put it 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.880
 on the bone of the cheekbone to give it that 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.880
 more light to the face 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:11.550
 lips use a copper-tone brief in 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.550
 this case is the zinc to monde more 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.010
 a little the brightness use the 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.010
 naturally 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.950
