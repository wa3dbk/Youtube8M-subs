 garlic bread let's go 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.100
 The ingredients are very simple to 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.719
 People are going to take about 10 12 cloves of garlic 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.649
 and depending on the size of how much you 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.559
 to like 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.179
 football Bread Italian I will 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.360
 make your choices is you do what? 

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:09.149
 Did you think it was cool 200 grams 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.720

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:14.970
 save a little more and curd 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.490
 oregano basil here in the case the chicago 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.560
 It's not you, you think it's better 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.210
 one more detail of this recipe I go 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.600
 use the curd people we did here on the channel 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.590
 To start, I'm going to put the processor 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.690
 dressing room and butter 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.280
 who has a big processor can 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.009
 put butter all at once 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.080
 daily teeth hope to process Melgaço 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.720
 my little do in two steps 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.080
 no processor tries to make the premix 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.729
 does not have a mirror garlic mix and part of the 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.130
 butter is a little more work like 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.990
 works the same way wrote those 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.670
 lenders and goes mixing with butter 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.670
 until it becomes a mass only come 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:07.460
 we need and move because the 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.460
 wood will take care of my processor 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:28.700
 this butter garlic cream is the 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.230
 our main ingredient in Brazil and 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.450
 if the one who plays us did here in the 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.620
 channel is half a quarter baby like this 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:49.430
 We 're going to need some more. 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:51.290
 strong banks when mixing and now 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.120
 this advantage I will prepare first 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.519
 of Italian bread, that's what we're going to 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.110
 use more area here after punk 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.750
 rock dog looks more like the 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.989
 and let's go there for a fee with 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:06.319
 concierge is using the small Italian 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:13.940
 he has a little more than a foot have 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:19.840
 open in the middle and now here we go 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.840
 put some of the curd 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:29.440
 do not need much on land will 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:31.920
 enter the butter here our butter 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.920
 rennet 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:47.980
 here we already have a little 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:49.870
 basil and it is ready and going 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.360
 for the oven, we're going to set up a 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.310
 quantity point can hit dog 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.209
 We're going to cut them in 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.209
 reach the end 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.769
 everything calls the cuts more or less with 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:10.760
 finger thick and you do the trick 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.760
 what do you think is cooler? 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.380
 now carefully on one flight and another on 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.859
 people spend a little bit of themselves 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.859
 Creamy cheese 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.259
 this rick james has put it on 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.620
 that face of good daily stuffed with 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:47.169
 cheese and now we come to our 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:47.169
 butter with swirled area passes pretty 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.550
 have pushed a little to the spans 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.330
 this part also has to be done with 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.520
 caution 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.620
 anton open you know a little you have 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:13.980
 problems the more careful 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:17.100
 At this stage, at this point, people 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:21.900
 can freeze if you want or could 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:24.470
 comfort in our case here is dangerous 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.470
 angelic 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.970
 now this daily bread he will stay in 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.890
 oven on low heat even gives me a 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:39.470
 look and get ready to eat 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.150
 in a little while will show how left alone 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.150
 a tip I think we did here 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.890
 of garlic butter serves as a seasoning for 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.720
 barbecue still make a picanha in the 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:49.850
 garlic like meat 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:54.040
 this is ideal here general butter 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.040
 garlic is very good indeed 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.380
 look 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.810
 this is the area of coupon 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:41.150
 This is the hot dog point of confrontation. 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.800

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:48.020
 football supermarket mainly stands 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.490
 very soft texture very similar to what 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.310
