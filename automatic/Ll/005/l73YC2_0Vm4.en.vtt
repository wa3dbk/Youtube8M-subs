00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:07.030
 but good 

00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:11.399
 at one o'clock 

00:00:11.399 --> 00:00:15.229
 Today we are here to make perfect Greek cuisine espresso 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.589
 we saw it now as the bartender's hand 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:22.929
 can achieve two perfect expressions thanks to the excellent mixture but the same 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:23.989
 identical hand 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:27.889
 unfortunately, with an excellent mixture it can serve anything but expressions 

00:00:27.889 --> 00:00:28.300
 good 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.739
 let's see two typical examples of the first artifacts not yes 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.930
 clean the filter holder you do not check if the correct dose or not poster a 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.239
 grinding for example was too big and we are going to make a 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.809
 espresso which is technically called underlay so swim with 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.139
 a vanishing essence essence the features 

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:56.540
 of the good Italian espresso 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.640
 here we are going to serve an espresso of this type 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.270
 you see in this case we have a coffee that practically has almost no cream on 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.950
 laundry 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.720
 and does not look good 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.380
 let's see now instead 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.670
 the coffee 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.670
 typically only on the right 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.670
 in this case 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.060
 the reason for the suppressed action 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.360
 it might be 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.640
 different and opposite to that of the first or rather dose of coffee 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.900
 excessive omaha still wobbles too fine or even machine with 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.960
 too high temperature and therefore burns the coffee technically 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.310
 going to make a coffee superstructure too 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.310
 in quantity of liquid 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.220
 and here is another example of how coffee should not be served 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.720
 an over coffee with a persistent dark cream and like 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.220
 you can see with the classic speck called white button 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.220
 present on the typical coffee above extraction sign 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.340
 if you followed all the rules you will get a perfect espresso from 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.289
 serve our customer who will show up 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.249
 with a beautiful room temperature cream hazelnut color 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:15.479
 compact and persistent that does not open even when the cup is turned 

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:19.489
 if you follow all the tips seen in this video 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.999
 using a gran caffÃ¨ blend 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:23.860
 surely you will succeed 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.800
 great bargain for your customers and I always recommend together 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.910
 in the smile
