00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
through now we're just going to sort of

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.969 
through now we're just going to sort of
push<00:02:02.970> on<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.240> macro<00:02:03.570> like<00:02:03.720> this<00:02:03.869> just<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.380> try

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.789 
obviously you're not quite going to
achieve<00:02:08.790> that<00:02:09.030> but<00:02:09.509> just<00:02:10.229> makes<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.619> bit

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
achieve that but just makes it a bit

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:12.890 
achieve that but just makes it a bit
easier<00:02:10.829> when<00:02:11.519> it<00:02:11.610> comes<00:02:11.820> to<00:02:12.150> applying<00:02:12.690> the

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
easier when it comes to applying the

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.170 
easier when it comes to applying the
bait<00:02:13.140> elastic<00:02:14.269> so<00:02:15.269> here's<00:02:15.660> our<00:02:15.810> elastic<00:02:17.180> now

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
bait elastic so here's our elastic now

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.380 
bait elastic so here's our elastic now
we're<00:02:18.390> going<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.600> go<00:02:18.780> round<00:02:19.790> just<00:02:20.790> start<00:02:21.180> it

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
we're going to go round just start it

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.160 
we're going to go round just start it
off<00:02:21.480> like<00:02:21.810> that

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
off like that

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.260 
off like that
then<00:02:22.770> going<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:22.950> pull<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.340> hook<00:02:23.550> up<00:02:23.730> through<00:02:24.060> a

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
then going to pull the hook up through a

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.809 
then going to pull the hook up through a
little<00:02:24.690> bit<00:02:24.810> more<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.349> standing<00:02:25.920> Pro<00:02:26.190> really

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
little bit more so standing Pro really

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:27.980 
little bit more so standing Pro really
important<00:02:27.599> to<00:02:27.660> get<00:02:27.810> your

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
important to get your

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.840 
important to get your
hooks<00:02:28.170> standing<00:02:29.160> proud<00:02:29.400> of<00:02:29.550> your<00:02:29.670> bait

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
hooks standing proud of your bait

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.910 
hooks standing proud of your bait
actually<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.900> see<00:02:31.050> a<00:02:31.080> lot<00:02:31.290> of<00:02:31.320> guys<00:02:31.590> miss

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
actually you see a lot of guys miss

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.790 
actually you see a lot of guys miss
bites<00:02:32.450> because<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.080> hook<00:02:34.260> points<00:02:34.650> become

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
bites because the the hook points become

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.100 
bites because the the hook points become
masked<00:02:35.460> by<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.640> bait<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.210> the<00:02:36.300> bait<00:02:36.480> elastic

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
masked by the bait and the bait elastic

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.210 
masked by the bait and the bait elastic
so<00:02:37.410> we're<00:02:38.040> going<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.220> avoid<00:02:38.460> that<00:02:40.160> plenty<00:02:41.160> of

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
so we're going to avoid that plenty of

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.790 
so we're going to avoid that plenty of
elastic<00:02:41.670> on<00:02:41.850> there<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:43.290> we're<00:02:43.440> going<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.620> work

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
elastic on there and we're going to work

alongside<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:43.080> bait<00:03:43.290> just<00:03:43.320> to<00:03:43.650> give<00:03:43.800> it<00:03:43.830> a

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
alongside the the bait just to give it a

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.160 
alongside the the bait just to give it a
bit<00:03:44.100> of<00:03:44.130> support<00:03:44.400> as<00:03:44.850> you<00:03:44.880> you're<00:03:45.600> baiting<00:03:45.870> it

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
bit of support as you you're baiting it

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.490 
bit of support as you you're baiting it
up<00:03:47.270> but<00:03:48.270> that's<00:03:48.420> pretty<00:03:48.720> much<00:03:48.990> done<00:03:49.290> now<00:03:49.470> I

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
up but that's pretty much done now I

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.990 
up but that's pretty much done now I
reckon<00:03:49.920> with<00:03:50.070> a<00:03:50.100> little<00:03:50.310> bit<00:03:50.400> more<00:03:50.580> around<00:03:50.880> the

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
reckon with a little bit more around the

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.090 
reckon with a little bit more around the
bends<00:03:51.270> there<00:03:51.630> just<00:03:52.230> to<00:03:52.320> stop<00:03:52.560> it<00:03:52.680> from<00:03:52.770> sliding

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
bends there just to stop it from sliding

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.050 
bends there just to stop it from sliding
around<00:03:53.450> put<00:03:54.450> it<00:03:54.570> up<00:03:54.690> tight<00:03:54.990> and<00:03:55.880> there<00:03:56.880> you

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
around put it up tight and there you

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.020 
around put it up tight and there you
have<00:03:57.090> it<00:03:57.300> as<00:03:57.870> I<00:03:58.380> say<00:03:58.560> that's<00:03:58.920> a<00:03:59.100> big<00:03:59.430> bait<00:03:59.760> it's

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
have it as I say that's a big bait it's

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.280 
have it as I say that's a big bait it's
not<00:04:00.330> the<00:04:00.450> sort<00:04:00.660> of<00:04:00.720> thing<00:04:00.900> you're<00:04:01.020> going<00:04:01.140> to<00:04:01.230> be

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
not the sort of thing you're going to be

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.590 
not the sort of thing you're going to be
using<00:04:01.650> every<00:04:01.830> day<00:04:02.220> no<00:04:02.910> good<00:04:03.150> for<00:04:03.300> fishing<00:04:03.480> for
