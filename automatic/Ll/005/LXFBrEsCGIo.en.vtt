we see behind the drone there are these
Hulk<00:04:46.400> gloves<00:04:46.910> which<00:04:47.180> are<00:04:47.360> like<00:04:47.570> this<00:04:47.780> sort<00:04:47.960> of

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
Hulk gloves which are like this sort of

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.409 
Hulk gloves which are like this sort of
repulsive<00:04:48.500> love<00:04:48.710> but<00:04:49.520> have<00:04:49.729> much<00:04:49.940> more<00:04:50.240> sort

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
repulsive love but have much more sort

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:51.820 
repulsive love but have much more sort
of<00:04:50.479> motion<00:04:50.990> to<00:04:51.110> them<00:04:51.260> it's<00:04:51.380> much<00:04:51.560> more<00:04:51.710> about

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
of motion to them it's much more about

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.830 
of motion to them it's much more about
pounding<00:04:52.550> and<00:04:52.850> hitting<00:04:53.180> and<00:04:53.300> stuff<00:04:53.510> like<00:04:53.630> that

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
pounding and hitting and stuff like that

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.750 
pounding and hitting and stuff like that
so<00:04:54.470> that's<00:04:54.560> what<00:04:54.770> we<00:04:54.860> think<00:04:55.130> about<00:04:55.280> play

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
so that's what we think about play

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.490 
so that's what we think about play
