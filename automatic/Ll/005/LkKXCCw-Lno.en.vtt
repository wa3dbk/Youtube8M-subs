hey guys it's Nelson with Galaxy Note 3

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.070 
hey guys it's Nelson with Galaxy Note 3
soft<00:00:02.610> mutter<00:00:02.850> and<00:00:03.060> today<00:00:03.629> I'm<00:00:03.720> gonna<00:00:03.810> show<00:00:04.049> you

soft mutter and today I'm gonna show you
how<00:00:04.259> to<00:00:04.319> check<00:00:04.620> your<00:00:04.799> mobile<00:00:05.370> broadband

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
how to check your mobile broadband

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.129 
how to check your mobile broadband
speeds<00:00:06.540> on<00:00:06.990> your<00:00:07.529> Galaxy<00:00:07.980> Note<00:00:08.130> 3<00:00:08.179> so<00:00:09.179> checking

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
speeds on your Galaxy Note 3 so checking

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.660 
speeds on your Galaxy Note 3 so checking
your<00:00:10.380> mobile<00:00:10.679> broadband<00:00:11.130> speed<00:00:11.400> isn't

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
your mobile broadband speed isn't

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.789 
your mobile broadband speed isn't
something<00:00:12.090> new<00:00:12.269> there's<00:00:12.799> several

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
something new there's several

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.320 
something new there's several
applications<00:00:14.370> out<00:00:14.490> there<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:14.820> can<00:00:14.969> do<00:00:15.120> that

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
applications out there that can do that

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.650 
applications out there that can do that
but<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.470> FCC<00:00:16.650> has<00:00:17.609> released<00:00:17.970> an<00:00:18.119> application

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
but the FCC has released an application

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.929 
but the FCC has released an application
recently<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.770> does<00:00:20.039> that<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.460> it's<00:00:20.850> an

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
recently that does that and it's an

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.900 
recently that does that and it's an
official<00:00:21.330> application<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.400> the<00:00:23.400> reason<00:00:23.730> I

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
official application and the reason I

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.019 
official application and the reason I
want<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.300> review<00:00:24.539> that<00:00:24.750> application<00:00:25.260> is

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
want to review that application is

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.490 
want to review that application is
because<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.210> will<00:00:27.330> help<00:00:27.539> out<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:28.140> FCC<00:00:28.910> map<00:00:29.910> out

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
because it will help out the FCC map out

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.319 
because it will help out the FCC map out
all<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:32.040> broadband<00:00:32.489> speeds<00:00:32.790> for<00:00:33.120> every

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
all the broadband speeds for every

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.569 
all the broadband speeds for every
carrier<00:00:33.719> which<00:00:34.410> in<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.649> future<00:00:34.950> will<00:00:35.130> help<00:00:35.280> us

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
carrier which in the future will help us

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.760 
carrier which in the future will help us
because<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.480> way<00:00:36.600> they<00:00:36.750> can<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.170> know<00:00:37.290> all

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
because that way they can you know all

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.799 
because that way they can you know all
the<00:00:37.890> carriers<00:00:38.280> will<00:00:38.460> have<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.700> map<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.059> where

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
the carriers will have a map of where

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.360 
the carriers will have a map of where
there's<00:00:40.020> weak<00:00:40.200> signals<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:40.920> whether<00:00:41.040> strong

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
there's weak signals and whether strong

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.819 
there's weak signals and whether strong
signals<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:41.969> how<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.090> improve<00:00:42.210> on<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.829> so

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
signals and how to improve on that so

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.160 
signals and how to improve on that so
I'm<00:00:44.730> gonna<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.660> can<00:00:45.690> download<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
it's called FCC speed test I already

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.920 
it's called FCC speed test I already
have<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.530> downloaded<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.480> all<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.600> have<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.809> do

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
always overtake the mobile so yeah make

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.800 
always overtake the mobile so yeah make
sure<00:01:13.619> Wi-Fi<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.220> off<00:01:14.490> Wi-Fi<00:01:15.240> as<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.540> can<00:01:15.689> see

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
sure Wi-Fi is off Wi-Fi as you can see

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.920 
sure Wi-Fi is off Wi-Fi as you can see
is<00:01:15.900> off<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:17.060> then<00:01:18.060> whoa<00:01:19.310> whoops<00:01:20.420> okay<00:01:21.420> go<00:01:21.810> back

you<00:01:26.130> can<00:01:26.280> choose<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:27.000> check<00:01:27.360> your<00:01:27.479> download

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
you can choose to check your download

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.230 
you can choose to check your download
speed<00:01:27.869> your<00:01:28.259> upload<00:01:28.500> speed<00:01:28.530> latency<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.490> all

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
speed your upload speed latency and all

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.980 
speed your upload speed latency and all
so<00:01:30.630> I'll<00:01:30.780> just<00:01:30.960> do<00:01:31.079> all<00:01:31.369> and<00:01:32.810> from<00:01:33.810> there

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
so I'll just do all and from there

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.270 
so I'll just do all and from there
you'll<00:01:34.140> see<00:01:34.350> it'll<00:01:34.680> load<00:01:34.920> it'll<00:01:35.130> take<00:01:35.220> a

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
you'll see it'll load it'll take a

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.160 
you'll see it'll load it'll take a
little<00:01:35.460> bit<00:01:36.860> so<00:01:37.860> while<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.820> wait<00:01:39.090> while<00:01:39.960> we<00:01:40.049> wait

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
little bit so while I wait while we wait

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.760 
little bit so while I wait while we wait
for<00:01:40.200> downloads<00:01:40.710> we<00:01:40.920> can<00:01:41.070> tell<00:01:41.340> them<00:01:42.770> average

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
for downloads we can tell them average

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.260 
for downloads we can tell them average
down<00:01:44.009> Oh<00:01:44.130> actually<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.549> fastest<00:01:45.000> upload

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
down Oh actually the fastest upload

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.010 
down Oh actually the fastest upload
speeds<00:01:45.540> up<00:01:45.810> they<00:01:46.619> go<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.890> AT&amp;T<00:01:47.600> so<00:01:48.600> for<00:01:48.899> them

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
speeds up they go to AT&amp;T so for them

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.300 
speeds up they go to AT&amp;T so for them
download<00:01:49.470> speeds<00:01:49.770> are<00:01:49.950> usually<00:01:50.369> at<00:01:50.549> around

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
download speeds are usually at around

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.830 
download speeds are usually at around
1920<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.990> upload<00:01:54.990> speeds<00:01:55.290> are<00:01:55.470> usually<00:01:56.369> at<00:01:56.460> 8

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
1920 and upload speeds are usually at 8

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.969 
1920 and upload speeds are usually at 8
so<00:01:57.840> as<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.020> can<00:01:58.140> see<00:01:58.290> right<00:01:58.439> now<00:01:58.500> download

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
so as you can see right now download

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.260 
so as you can see right now download
speed<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.369> little<00:01:59.460> bit<00:01:59.729> higher<00:01:59.909> than<00:02:00.119> usual

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
speed is a little bit higher than usual

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.819 
speed is a little bit higher than usual
and<00:02:00.659> upload<00:02:01.140> speeds<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.409> little<00:02:01.560> bit<00:02:01.649> lower

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
and upload speeds a little bit lower

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.620 
and upload speeds a little bit lower
than<00:02:01.979> usual<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.430> always<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:02.820> also<00:02:02.969> varies<00:02:03.420> on

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
than usual it always it also varies on

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.160 
than usual it always it also varies on
where<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.079> are<00:02:04.430> I'm<00:02:05.430> near<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.700> tower<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.329> it'll

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
where you are I'm near a tower so it'll

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.990 
where you are I'm near a tower so it'll
usually<00:02:07.290> be<00:02:07.619> good<00:02:07.799> then<00:02:08.399> here<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.819> has<00:02:08.970> a

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
usually be good then here it has a

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.500 
usually be good then here it has a
latency<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.840> packet<00:02:09.959> loss<00:02:11.270> packing<00:02:12.270> loss<00:02:12.360> is

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
latency and packet loss packing loss is

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.050 
latency and packet loss packing loss is
usually

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
usually

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.949 
usually
0%<00:02:14.040> that's<00:02:15.040> how<00:02:15.580> much<00:02:15.730> data<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.209> lose<00:02:16.420> that

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
0% that's how much data you lose that

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.830 
0% that's how much data you lose that
you're<00:02:17.080> trying<00:02:17.380> to<00:02:17.530> receive<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:21.150> we<00:02:22.150> should

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
you're trying to receive and we should

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.940 
you're trying to receive and we should
be<00:02:22.990> about<00:02:23.230> done

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.580 

and<00:02:27.300> Oh<00:02:28.300> actually<00:02:28.810> I<00:02:29.020> didn't<00:02:29.200> even<00:02:29.260> say<00:02:29.470> what

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
and Oh actually I didn't even say what

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.110 
and Oh actually I didn't even say what
latency<00:02:29.980> is<00:02:30.069> latency<00:02:30.730> is<00:02:31.620> how<00:02:32.620> long<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.910> lag

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
latency is latency is how long the lag

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.199 
latency is latency is how long the lag
is<00:02:34.480> so<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.560> lower<00:02:35.770> the<00:02:36.130> milliseconds<00:02:37.060> the

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
is so the lower the milliseconds the

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.559 
is so the lower the milliseconds the
better<00:02:37.420> and<00:02:37.870> there<00:02:38.650> you<00:02:38.770> can<00:02:38.920> see<00:02:39.130> your<00:02:40.060> speeds

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
better and there you can see your speeds

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:41.970 
better and there you can see your speeds
you<00:02:40.720> can<00:02:40.750> check<00:02:41.020> other<00:02:41.170> stuff<00:02:41.440> like<00:02:41.620> your<00:02:41.800> cell

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
you can check other stuff like your cell

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.090 
you can check other stuff like your cell
tower<00:02:42.190> ad<00:02:42.750> cell<00:02:43.750> tower<00:02:43.930> area<00:02:44.200> location<00:02:44.860> code

operator<00:02:47.920> I<00:02:48.070> have<00:02:48.130> AT&amp;T<00:02:48.489> so<00:02:49.030> that's<00:02:49.209> why<00:02:49.330> it's

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
operator I have AT&amp;T so that's why it's

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.090 
operator I have AT&amp;T so that's why it's
on<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.600> quicker<00:02:49.840> and<00:02:50.170> you<00:02:50.650> can<00:02:50.800> just<00:02:50.950> check<00:02:51.040> a

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
on the quicker and you can just check a

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.220 
on the quicker and you can just check a
bunch<00:02:51.340> of<00:02:51.459> other<00:02:51.580> stuff<00:02:51.820> here<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.420> the

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
bunch of other stuff here and the

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.960 
bunch of other stuff here and the
application<00:02:53.650> runs<00:02:53.830> in<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.010> background<00:02:54.160> it

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
application runs in the background it

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.180 
application runs in the background it
can<00:02:55.150> be<00:02:55.269> checked<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:58.840> can<00:02:58.989> be<00:02:59.110> checked<00:02:59.319> up<00:02:59.560> you

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
can be checked it can be checked up you

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.940 
can be checked it can be checked up you
know<00:03:00.280> every<00:03:00.610> once<00:03:01.090> in<00:03:01.180> a<00:03:01.269> while<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:02.680> can<00:03:02.800> have

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
know every once in a while you can have

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.850 
know every once in a while you can have
a<00:03:02.980> check<00:03:03.190> every<00:03:03.400> day<00:03:04.230> every<00:03:05.230> week<00:03:05.470> and<00:03:05.830> that

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
a check every day every week and that

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.130 
a check every day every week and that
way<00:03:06.610> these<00:03:06.760> tests<00:03:07.180> are<00:03:07.269> sent<00:03:07.420> to<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.600> FCC<00:03:07.989> and

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
way these tests are sent to the FCC and

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.960 
way these tests are sent to the FCC and
then<00:03:08.230> they<00:03:08.380> can<00:03:08.530> map<00:03:08.650> it<00:03:08.830> out<00:03:08.920> and<00:03:09.190> I<00:03:09.250> know<00:03:09.310> that

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
then they can map it out and I know that

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.309 
then they can map it out and I know that
usually<00:03:10.150> people<00:03:10.420> don't<00:03:10.690> want<00:03:10.900> to<00:03:10.930> just<00:03:11.140> send

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
usually people don't want to just send

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.290 
usually people don't want to just send
stuff<00:03:11.650> to<00:03:11.709> the<00:03:11.920> FCC<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.400> check<00:03:12.730> but<00:03:12.970> all<00:03:13.120> it

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
stuff to the FCC to check but all it

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.880 
stuff to the FCC to check but all it
does<00:03:13.480> is<00:03:13.750> it<00:03:13.870> checks<00:03:14.110> your<00:03:14.200> speed<00:03:14.590> it<00:03:14.709> doesn't

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
does is it checks your speed it doesn't

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.240 
does is it checks your speed it doesn't
check<00:03:15.600> exact<00:03:16.600> your<00:03:16.780> exact<00:03:17.110> location<00:03:17.260> or<00:03:17.950> other

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
check exact your exact location or other

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.440 
check exact your exact location or other
stuff<00:03:18.519> on<00:03:18.610> your<00:03:18.730> device<00:03:19.000> so<00:03:19.150> don't<00:03:19.360> worry

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
stuff on your device so don't worry

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.420 
stuff on your device so don't worry
about<00:03:19.600> any<00:03:19.959> kind<00:03:20.049> of<00:03:20.320> privacy<00:03:20.680> issues<00:03:21.070> because

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
about any kind of privacy issues because

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.100 
about any kind of privacy issues because
there's<00:03:22.000> none<00:03:22.209> because<00:03:22.510> I<00:03:22.720> wouldn't<00:03:22.989> do<00:03:23.079> that

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
there's none because I wouldn't do that

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.160 
there's none because I wouldn't do that
so<00:03:23.470> all<00:03:24.430> right<00:03:24.549> that's<00:03:25.090> it<00:03:25.209> guys<00:03:25.269> thanks<00:03:25.750> don't
