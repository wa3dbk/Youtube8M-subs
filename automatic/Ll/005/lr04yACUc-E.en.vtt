00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:35.319 
medium one more time and you have high

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:38.249 
medium one more time and you have high
and<00:01:35.619> repeat<00:01:36.549> that<00:01:36.729> and<00:01:37.509> it'll<00:01:37.810> go<00:01:37.929> through<00:01:38.170> the

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
and repeat that and it'll go through the

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:39.959 
and repeat that and it'll go through the
different<00:01:38.350> brightnesses<00:01:38.920> again<00:01:39.189> and<00:01:39.880> you

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:39.969 
different brightnesses again and you

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:42.300 
different brightnesses again and you
keep<00:01:40.149> on<00:01:40.299> doing<00:01:40.539> that<00:01:40.659> over<00:01:40.840> and<00:01:40.960> over<00:01:41.109> now<00:01:41.920> it

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
keep on doing that over and over now it

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.980 
keep on doing that over and over now it
as<00:01:42.429> the<00:01:42.579> mother<00:01:42.759> modes<00:01:43.030> as<00:01:43.210> well<00:01:43.240> so<00:01:43.719> if<00:01:43.780> you<00:01:43.869> go

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
as the mother modes as well so if you go

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.419 
as the mother modes as well so if you go
through<00:01:44.229> the<00:01:44.289> three<00:01:44.499> brightnesses<00:01:45.039> twice

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:45.429 
through the three brightnesses twice

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:48.179 
through the three brightnesses twice
quickly<00:01:45.969> we<00:01:46.420> go<00:01:46.539> one<00:01:46.810> two<00:01:46.840> three<00:01:47.649> one<00:01:48.159> two

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
quickly we go one two three one two

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.029 
quickly we go one two three one two
three<00:01:49.119> after<00:01:50.079> that<00:01:50.229> you<00:01:50.409> have<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.649> flashing

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
three after that you have the flashing

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.059 
three after that you have the flashing
mode<00:01:51.189> so<00:01:51.429> you<00:01:51.490> have<00:01:51.609> strobe<00:01:51.969> off<00:01:52.600> and<00:01:52.959> on<00:01:53.109> SOS

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
mode so you have strobe off and on SOS

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:56.910 
mode so you have strobe off and on SOS
off<00:01:54.789> and<00:01:55.270> on<00:01:55.389> beacon<00:01:56.020> flashing<00:01:56.380> modes<00:01:56.590> so

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
off and on beacon flashing modes so

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.919 
off and on beacon flashing modes so
those<00:01:57.069> are<00:01:57.219> the<00:01:57.249> hidden<00:01:57.429> flashing<00:01:57.909> modes<00:01:58.090> go

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
those are the hidden flashing modes go

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:00.029 
those are the hidden flashing modes go
through<00:01:59.109> the<00:01:59.170> three<00:01:59.380> brightness<00:01:59.709> is<00:01:59.859> twice

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
through the three brightness is twice

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.129 
through the three brightness is twice
quickly<00:02:00.459> and<00:02:00.670> you'll<00:02:00.909> get<00:02:01.029> to<00:02:01.149> those<00:02:01.299> and<00:02:01.600> then

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:02.139 
quickly and you'll get to those and then

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:03.719 
quickly and you'll get to those and then
leave<00:02:02.319> it<00:02:02.469> off<00:02:02.590> for<00:02:02.619> a<00:02:02.889> couple<00:02:02.979> seconds<00:02:03.520> and

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
leave it off for a couple seconds and

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.699 
leave it off for a couple seconds and
then<00:02:04.149> when<00:02:04.270> you<00:02:04.359> turn<00:02:04.479> it<00:02:04.539> back<00:02:04.779> on<00:02:04.810> it's<00:02:05.529> going

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:05.709 
then when you turn it back on it's going

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:07.349 
then when you turn it back on it's going
to<00:02:05.740> be<00:02:05.889> back<00:02:06.069> in<00:02:06.279> the<00:02:06.369> default<00:02:06.700> low<00:02:06.909> so<00:02:07.179> every

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:07.359 
to be back in the default low so every

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:08.850 
to be back in the default low so every
time<00:02:07.389> you<00:02:07.659> turn<00:02:07.779> it<00:02:07.929> on<00:02:08.050> after<00:02:08.319> having<00:02:08.679> it<00:02:08.770> off

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
time you turn it on after having it off

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.380 
time you turn it on after having it off
for<00:02:09.009> a<00:02:09.069> little<00:02:09.190> while<00:02:09.369> you<00:02:09.970> get<00:02:10.060> that<00:02:10.239> low

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
for a little while you get that low

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.479 
for a little while you get that low
brightness<00:02:10.569> and<00:02:10.989> then<00:02:11.260> you<00:02:11.319> can<00:02:11.439> cycle<00:02:11.590> up<00:02:11.890> to

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
brightness and then you can cycle up to

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:13.800 
brightness and then you can cycle up to
the<00:02:12.610> higher<00:02:12.730> brightnesses<00:02:13.269> and<00:02:13.540> your

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
the higher brightnesses and your

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.850 
the higher brightnesses and your
flashing<00:02:14.170> mode

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
flashing mode

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.600 
flashing mode
alright<00:02:15.860> we're<00:02:16.010> going<00:02:16.070> to<00:02:16.190> go<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:16.400> take<00:02:16.490> this

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
alright we're going to go and take this

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.370 
alright we're going to go and take this
little<00:02:16.880> guy<00:02:17.000> outside<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:17.660> we'll<00:02:17.960> see<00:02:18.110> how<00:02:18.260> it

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
little guy outside and we'll see how it

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.750 
little guy outside and we'll see how it
does<00:02:18.500> outside<00:02:19.360> here<00:02:20.360> is<00:02:20.570> the<00:02:20.810> satin<00:02:21.760> titanium

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
does outside here is the satin titanium

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.790 
does outside here is the satin titanium
mini<00:02:22.970> one<00:02:23.210> two<00:02:23.390> three<00:02:23.630> with<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:23.900> s3<00:02:24.350> and<00:02:24.620> got

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
mini one two three with the s3 and got

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.200 
mini one two three with the s3 and got
it<00:02:24.890> outside<00:02:25.220> we're<00:02:25.580> going<00:02:25.700> to<00:02:25.760> be<00:02:25.820> comparing

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
it outside we're going to be comparing

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.570 
it outside we're going to be comparing
it<00:02:26.300> to<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.420> big<00:02:26.660> 40<00:02:27.530> maglite<00:02:28.070> that<00:02:28.250> we<00:02:28.310> always

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
it to the big 40 maglite that we always

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.130 
it to the big 40 maglite that we always
use<00:02:28.760> so<00:02:29.120> let's<00:02:29.330> try<00:02:29.480> that<00:02:29.600> mag<00:02:29.810> light<00:02:29.990> out

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
use so let's try that mag light out

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.000 
use so let's try that mag light out
first<00:02:31.420> all<00:02:32.420> right<00:02:32.540> a<00:02:32.720> little<00:02:33.290> bush<00:02:33.410> 15<00:02:33.800> feet

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
first all right a little bush 15 feet

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.280 
first all right a little bush 15 feet
away<00:02:35.470> 300<00:02:36.470> feet<00:02:36.950> away<00:02:37.900> ground<00:02:38.900> in<00:02:39.020> front<00:02:39.140> of

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
away 300 feet away ground in front of

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.600 
away 300 feet away ground in front of
the<00:02:39.380> tree<00:02:39.560> this<00:02:39.950> is<00:02:40.100> the<00:02:40.250> incandescent

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
the tree this is the incandescent

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.030 
the tree this is the incandescent
version<00:02:41.210> it's<00:02:42.050> tightly<00:02:42.200> focused<00:02:42.470> as<00:02:42.770> they<00:02:42.890> can

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
version it's tightly focused as they can

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.750 
version it's tightly focused as they can
get<00:02:43.220> with<00:02:44.090> fresh<00:02:44.780> d-cell<00:02:45.290> batteries<00:02:45.760> all

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
get with fresh d-cell batteries all

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.460 
get with fresh d-cell batteries all
right<00:02:46.880> let's<00:02:47.120> try<00:02:47.240> out<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.540> mini<00:02:47.720> I<00:02:47.900> try<00:02:48.290> it<00:02:48.350> on

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
right let's try out the mini I try it on

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.410 
right let's try out the mini I try it on
low<00:02:48.650> first<00:02:48.950> there<00:02:49.430> you<00:02:49.490> can<00:02:49.580> see<00:02:49.670> even<00:02:50.060> on<00:02:50.240> low

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
low first there you can see even on low

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.330 
low first there you can see even on low
15<00:02:50.900> feet<00:02:51.050> away<00:02:51.140> actually<00:02:51.410> does<00:02:51.710> pretty<00:02:51.920> well<00:02:52.010> I

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
15 feet away actually does pretty well I

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.600 
15 feet away actually does pretty well I
will<00:02:52.910> show<00:02:53.030> you<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.210> gun<00:02:53.390> in<00:02:53.570> front<00:02:53.780> of<00:02:53.840> me

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
will show you the gun in front of me

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.730 
will show you the gun in front of me
there's<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:55.820> ground<00:02:56.000> you<00:02:56.300> can<00:02:56.420> see<00:02:56.570> out<00:02:57.530> to

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
there's the ground you can see out to

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.380 
there's the ground you can see out to
probably<00:02:57.920> good<00:02:58.220> 15<00:02:58.550> 20<00:02:58.700> feet<00:02:59.030> it<00:02:59.240> actually

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
probably good 15 20 feet it actually

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.960 
probably good 15 20 feet it actually
lights<00:02:59.720> up<00:02:59.900> things<00:03:00.110> pretty<00:03:00.530> well<00:03:00.790> it's<00:03:01.790> kind

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
lights up things pretty well it's kind

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.070 
lights up things pretty well it's kind
of<00:03:02.000> surprising<00:03:02.120> because<00:03:02.540> it's<00:03:02.720> not<00:03:02.840> putting

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
of surprising because it's not putting

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.800 
of surprising because it's not putting
out<00:03:03.140> a<00:03:03.200> whole<00:03:03.410> lot<00:03:03.560> of<00:03:03.650> light<00:03:03.830> at<00:03:04.310> that<00:03:04.490> level

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
out a whole lot of light at that level

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.140 
out a whole lot of light at that level
there's<00:03:05.810> medium<00:03:06.230> you<00:03:07.070> see<00:03:07.280> 15<00:03:07.640> feet<00:03:07.910> does

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
there's medium you see 15 feet does

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.200 
there's medium you see 15 feet does
really<00:03:08.360> well<00:03:08.570> I<00:03:08.810> mean<00:03:09.200> out<00:03:09.350> to<00:03:09.440> 100<00:03:09.770> feet<00:03:10.210> it's

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
really well I mean out to 100 feet it's
