that has this problem here's some tips

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.910 
that has this problem here's some tips
here's<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.399> old<00:00:32.730> one<00:00:33.380> that's<00:00:34.380> what<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.739> looks

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
here's the old one that's what it looks

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.590 
here's the old one that's what it looks
like<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.899> the<00:00:36.899> procedure<00:00:37.320> for<00:00:37.649> changing<00:00:37.890> it

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
like and the procedure for changing it

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.470 
like and the procedure for changing it
is<00:00:39.600> you'll<00:00:39.870> shut<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.379> red<00:00:40.680> valve<00:00:41.480> quarter

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
is you'll shut this red valve quarter

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.260 
is you'll shut this red valve quarter
turn<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:42.930> way<00:00:43.550> that<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.059> off

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
turn that way that is in the off

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.400 
turn that way that is in the off
position<00:00:47.239> that<00:00:48.239> with<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.660> little<00:00:48.870> tip<00:00:49.170> right

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
position that with that little tip right

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.639 
position that with that little tip right
there<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.739> in<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.950> on<00:00:50.100> position<00:00:50.960> so<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.469> is

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
there is in the on position so this is

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.160 
there is in the on position so this is
your<00:00:52.829> line<00:00:53.010> coming<00:00:53.520> from<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.969> tank<00:00:54.270> fuel<00:00:54.780> tank

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
your line coming from the tank fuel tank

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.970 
your line coming from the tank fuel tank
into<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.160> filter<00:00:56.640> separator<00:00:57.530> so<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.590> turn<00:00:58.829> it

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
into the filter separator so you turn it

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.950 
into the filter separator so you turn it
off<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.520> then<00:01:00.620> this<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.829> collar<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.960> you

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
off and then this is a collar and you

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.859 
off and then this is a collar and you
turn<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.470> collar<00:01:06.560> to<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.590> left<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.869> this

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
turn that collar to the left and this

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.740 
turn that collar to the left and this
will<00:01:10.260> slide<00:01:10.560> down<00:01:11.299> although<00:01:12.299> it's<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.600> there

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
will slide down although it's in there

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.560 
will slide down although it's in there
pretty<00:01:12.930> tight<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.970> it's<00:01:14.970> got<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> little

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
air at the top but you shouldn't have to

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.110 
air at the top but you shouldn't have to
as<00:03:58.680> long<00:03:58.830> as<00:03:58.920> you<00:03:59.069> use<00:03:59.280> that<00:03:59.430> lift<00:03:59.700> pump<00:03:59.910> right

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
there it should work just fine so if

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.190 
there it should work just fine so if
you've<00:04:03.000> got<00:04:03.090> a<00:04:03.150> John<00:04:03.420> Deere<00:04:03.569> tractor<00:04:03.630> like

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200

that and you're going to change your

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.780 
that and you're going to change your
fuel<00:04:07.290> filter<00:04:07.530> and<00:04:07.920> it<00:04:08.010> don't<00:04:08.160> start<00:04:08.519> and<00:04:08.700> just

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
fuel filter and it don't start and just

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.420 
fuel filter and it don't start and just
cranks<00:04:09.150> and<00:04:09.269> cranks<00:04:09.709> follow<00:04:10.709> that<00:04:10.980> procedure

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
cranks and cranks follow that procedure

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.170
