00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.680
 exactly 42 minutes after the 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.930
 hour was left to listen 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.849
 to this live alarm is the reason why 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.550
 our question of the day if it is a 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.940
 alarm that has no button you can not 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.250
 stop the pain and have no mercy until 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.529
 cover if you said because the only 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.480
 way to turn it off the alarm name 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.580
 is an application created for 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.710
 mobile phones and there are no 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.449
 bones called we can not take and in addition 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.279
 It is also a social experience because 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.960
 you have to compete against your friends 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.059
 to know who are the ones who 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.829
 wake up earlier or those who 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.230
 move the phone more so you can win 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.360
 points to talk about the subject we have to 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.430
 the creators of this alarm in 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.079
 only three seconds I think it's going to 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.590
 sound that what in function before that 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.790

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.059
 Spanish 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.869
 hello how are you like after 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.330
 start by asking where it came from 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.369
 the idea of creating an alarm that does not have 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.939
 self and above all I tell you both 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.939
 wake up 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 we 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.350
 just as energetically there exists once 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:53.000
 is sounding and you start to move the 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.050
 phone 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.050
 later 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.140
 but 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.140
 and not for 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.190
 all 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:17.000
 not always 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:20.680
 when it costs less 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.680
 today is quite 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:34.819
 and I got tired I think that I had already 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.319
 awakened none but then I go back 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.310
 that it really is outside of the phone 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.310
 to turn off the alarm 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:48.170
 of professionals and professionals 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.170
 ahead 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.380
 With everyone 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.500

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.150
 on facebook 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:26.489
 and then it is such a social experience 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:28.170
 Once a prize wins together what is 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.519

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.519
 they shook the phone louder 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.810
 the conquest 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.950
