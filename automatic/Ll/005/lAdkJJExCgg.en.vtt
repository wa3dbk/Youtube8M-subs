the<00:00:00.480> next<00:00:00.780> technique<00:00:01.140> we're<00:00:01.290> going<00:00:01.350> to<00:00:01.500> do<00:00:01.680> is

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
the next technique we're going to do is

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.499 
the next technique we're going to do is
a<00:00:02.159> goddess<00:00:02.520> braid<00:00:02.850> a<00:00:03.120> goddess<00:00:03.810> braid<00:00:04.110> is<00:00:04.380> a

00:00:05.499 --> 00:00:05.509 
a goddess braid a goddess braid is a

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.669 
a goddess braid a goddess braid is a
large<00:00:06.589> inverted<00:00:07.639> cornrow<00:00:08.840> with<00:00:09.840> hair<00:00:10.170> added

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
large inverted cornrow with hair added

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:20.940 
large inverted cornrow with hair added
you<00:00:11.610> can<00:00:11.730> also<00:00:11.910> do<00:00:12.210> it<00:00:12.360> with<00:00:12.509> out<00:00:12.929> hair<00:00:13.349> at<00:00:13.559> it

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:20.950 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.590 

goddess<00:00:21.950> braids<00:00:22.250> are<00:00:22.430> parted<00:00:22.820> just<00:00:23.090> like<00:00:23.270> corn

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
goddess braids are parted just like corn

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.190 
goddess braids are parted just like corn
rolls<00:00:23.870> but<00:00:24.170> usually<00:00:24.620> they're<00:00:24.800> much<00:00:25.130> larger

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.200 
rolls but usually they're much larger

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.890 
rolls but usually they're much larger
giving<00:00:27.200> it<00:00:27.320> more<00:00:27.530> of<00:00:27.590> a<00:00:27.800> crown<00:00:28.630> effect<00:00:29.630> and

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
giving it more of a crown effect and

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.120 
giving it more of a crown effect and
wraps<00:00:30.320> around<00:00:30.470> the<00:00:30.800> head<00:00:31.070> and<00:00:31.660> gives<00:00:32.660> it<00:00:32.870> a

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.130 
wraps around the head and gives it a

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:43.150 
wraps around the head and gives it a
thick<00:00:35.980> crown<00:00:36.980> effect<00:00:37.550> usually<00:00:41.650> thus<00:00:42.650> calling

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
thick crown effect usually thus calling

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.310 
thick crown effect usually thus calling
it<00:00:43.280> the<00:00:43.400> goddess<00:00:43.730> braid<00:00:46.750> the<00:00:47.750> technique<00:00:48.170> for

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
it the goddess braid the technique for

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.049 
it the goddess braid the technique for
this<00:00:48.470> is<00:00:48.650> the<00:00:48.770> same<00:00:48.800> as<00:00:49.220> a<00:00:49.250> cornrow<00:00:49.640> but<00:00:49.940> we're

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
this is the same as a cornrow but we're

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.600 
this is the same as a cornrow but we're
going<00:00:50.180> to<00:00:50.239> do<00:00:50.510> an<00:00:50.720> inverted<00:00:51.620> cornrow<00:00:52.250> instead

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
going to do an inverted cornrow instead

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.250 
going to do an inverted cornrow instead
of<00:00:52.730> braiding<00:00:53.500> out<00:00:54.500> we're<00:00:55.190> going<00:00:55.340> to<00:00:55.400> braid<00:00:55.670> in

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
of braiding out we're going to braid in

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:04.540 
of braiding out we're going to braid in
it's<00:00:57.260> an<00:00:57.380> inverted<00:00:57.829> cornrow<00:01:02.680> using<00:01:03.680> a<00:01:03.920> very

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
it's an inverted cornrow using a very

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.840 
it's an inverted cornrow using a very
large<00:01:08.350> section<00:01:09.350> of<00:01:09.710> hair<00:01:10.009> because<00:01:10.399> you<00:01:10.580> want

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
large section of hair because you want

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.310 
large section of hair because you want
the<00:01:11.780> hair<00:01:12.110> basically<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:14.420> size<00:01:14.720> of<00:01:14.960> the<00:01:15.050> braid

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
the hair basically the size of the braid

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.620 
the hair basically the size of the braid
to<00:01:16.070> be<00:01:16.250> as<00:01:16.399> large<00:01:16.670> as<00:01:16.850> the<00:01:17.000> part<00:01:18.280> so<00:01:19.450> you<00:01:20.450> want

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
to be as large as the part so you want

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.810 
to be as large as the part so you want
to<00:01:20.690> add<00:01:20.840> a<00:01:20.869> lot<00:01:21.170> of<00:01:21.229> hair<00:01:21.560> for<00:01:22.490> the<00:01:22.610> goddess

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
to add a lot of hair for the goddess

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.870 
to add a lot of hair for the goddess
braid<00:01:24.520> to<00:01:25.520> make<00:01:25.550> a<00:01:25.759> very<00:01:26.149> thick<00:01:26.630> braid<00:01:27.759> so<00:01:28.759> on

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
braid to make a very thick braid so on

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.940 
braid to make a very thick braid so on
this<00:01:29.060> technique<00:01:31.090> to<00:01:32.090> add<00:01:32.330> the<00:01:32.720> hair<00:01:33.080> first<00:01:33.649> you

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
this technique to add the hair first you

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.370 
this technique to add the hair first you
want<00:01:34.160> to<00:01:34.250> section<00:01:34.729> it<00:01:34.850> into<00:01:35.450> a<00:01:35.479> small<00:01:35.869> part<00:01:36.200> in

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
want to section it into a small part in

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.080 
want to section it into a small part in
the<00:01:36.470> very<00:01:36.619> front<00:01:36.920> like<00:01:37.670> that<00:01:39.640> then<00:01:40.640> you<00:01:40.850> want

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
the very front like that then you want

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.880 
the very front like that then you want
to<00:01:42.970> lay<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.660> hair<00:01:45.110> that<00:01:45.470> you're<00:01:45.679> using

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
to lay the hair that you're using

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.779 
to lay the hair that you're using
in-between<00:01:46.789> that<00:01:47.209> hair<00:01:47.569> like<00:01:48.350> that<00:01:48.679> and<00:01:48.979> you

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
in-between that hair like that and you

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.850 
in-between that hair like that and you
basically<00:01:50.240> want<00:01:50.660> to<00:01:53.110> there's<00:01:54.110> two<00:01:54.200> techniques

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
basically want to there's two techniques

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.330 
basically want to there's two techniques
to<00:01:55.039> this<00:01:55.450> one<00:01:56.450> is<00:01:56.750> you<00:01:57.050> can<00:01:57.229> take<00:01:57.500> this<00:01:57.950> hair

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
to this one is you can take this hair

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.760 
to this one is you can take this hair
add<00:01:58.550> a<00:01:58.610> little<00:01:59.090> bit<00:01:59.360> of<00:01:59.479> her<00:01:59.720> hair<00:01:59.959> from<00:02:00.170> behind

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
add a little bit of her hair from behind

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.260 
add a little bit of her hair from behind
and<00:02:01.720> make<00:02:02.720> a<00:02:02.750> small<00:02:03.200> braid<00:02:03.619> to<00:02:04.550> hold<00:02:04.849> the<00:02:05.060> hair

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
and make a small braid to hold the hair

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.839 
and make a small braid to hold the hair
on<00:02:06.250> this<00:02:07.250> is<00:02:07.459> a<00:02:07.490> real<00:02:07.819> easy<00:02:08.090> technique<00:02:09.849> so

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
on this is a real easy technique so

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.360 
on this is a real easy technique so
holding<00:02:11.300> it<00:02:11.510> on

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
holding it on

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.059 
holding it on
that<00:02:13.930> just<00:02:14.930> braid<00:02:15.170> it<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:15.379> little<00:02:15.560> bit<00:02:15.739> so<00:02:15.920> I<00:02:15.980> can

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
that just braid it a little bit so I can

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.410 
that just braid it a little bit so I can
hold<00:02:16.310> it<00:02:16.459> then<00:02:17.140> separating<00:02:18.140> it<00:02:18.290> off<00:02:18.849> into<00:02:19.849> your

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
hold it then separating it off into your

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.570 
hold it then separating it off into your
three<00:02:20.750> strands<00:02:21.290> using<00:02:21.830> some<00:02:22.190> of<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.370> hair

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
three strands using some of the hair

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.960 
three strands using some of the hair
from<00:02:22.819> all<00:02:23.440> three<00:02:24.440> pieces<00:02:24.860> and<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.580> synthetic

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
from all three pieces and the synthetic

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.039 
from all three pieces and the synthetic
hair<00:02:26.120> that<00:02:26.390> you<00:02:26.510> add<00:02:26.720> or<00:02:27.709> a<00:02:27.769> human<00:02:28.190> hair

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
hair that you add or a human hair

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.150 
hair that you add or a human hair
dividing<00:02:30.049> it<00:02:30.170> into<00:02:30.319> three<00:02:30.650> sections<00:02:30.860> just

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
dividing it into three sections just

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.330 
dividing it into three sections just
like<00:02:31.519> the<00:02:31.670> regular<00:02:31.849> basic<00:02:32.450> braid<00:02:32.709> one<00:02:33.709> two

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
like the regular basic braid one two

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:42.070 
like the regular basic braid one two
three<00:02:34.970> and<00:02:35.239> start<00:02:36.200> crossing<00:02:38.890> over<00:02:41.080> bringing

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
three and start crossing over bringing

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.080 
three and start crossing over bringing
it<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.530> middle<00:02:42.769> and<00:02:43.069> bring<00:02:43.610> me<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.879> middle

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
it to the middle and bring me the middle

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:51.550 
it to the middle and bring me the middle
to<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.110> right<00:02:48.489> crossing<00:02:49.489> the<00:02:49.730> left<00:02:50.510> side<00:02:50.810> over

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
to the right crossing the left side over

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.470 
to the right crossing the left side over
to<00:02:53.709> the<00:02:54.709> middle<00:02:55.010> grabbing<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:55.760> hair<00:02:56.030> behind

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
to the middle grabbing the hair behind

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.410 
to the middle grabbing the hair behind
it<00:02:57.019> so<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:57.349> can<00:02:57.650> make<00:02:58.250> it<00:02:58.370> a<00:02:58.459> chain<00:02:58.760> link<00:02:59.060> just

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
it so you can make it a chain link just

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.180 
it so you can make it a chain link just
like<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.660> other<00:02:59.780> cornrows<00:03:00.200> and<00:03:00.440> bringing<00:03:01.040> it

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
like the other cornrows and bringing it

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.199 
like the other cornrows and bringing it
to<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:01.459> middle<00:03:01.900> bring<00:03:02.900> this<00:03:03.079> over<00:03:03.349> to<00:03:04.209> the

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
to the middle bring this over to the

middle over to the middle in the middle
to<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:11.810> side<00:03:13.930> it's<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.079> same<00:03:15.349> as<00:03:15.530> doing<00:03:15.920> a

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
to the side it's the same as doing a

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:17.379 
to the side it's the same as doing a
regular<00:03:16.340> cornrow<00:03:16.910> but<00:03:17.060> you're<00:03:17.180> going

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
regular cornrow but you're going

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.979 
regular cornrow but you're going
overhand<00:03:18.019> like<00:03:18.440> the<00:03:18.590> overhand<00:03:18.799> braid<00:03:19.280> and

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
overhand like the overhand braid and

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.870 
overhand like the overhand braid and
you're<00:03:20.989> using<00:03:21.230> a<00:03:21.410> lot<00:03:21.590> more<00:03:21.620> hair<00:03:22.130> to<00:03:22.639> make<00:03:22.819> a

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
you're using a lot more hair to make a

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.960 
you're using a lot more hair to make a
thick<00:03:25.090> cornrow<00:03:27.040> so<00:03:28.040> basically<00:03:28.430> these<00:03:28.730> are

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
thick cornrow so basically these are

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.300 
thick cornrow so basically these are
thick<00:03:29.299> inverted<00:03:30.790> cornrows<00:03:33.220> adding<00:03:34.220> the

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
thick inverted cornrows adding the

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.920 
thick inverted cornrows adding the
different<00:03:34.459> color<00:03:34.819> here<00:03:35.090> makes<00:03:35.420> it<00:03:35.569> look<00:03:35.720> real

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
different color here makes it look real

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.210 
different color here makes it look real

highlights it looks really cool you have

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.990 
highlights it looks really cool you have
to<00:03:42.380> make<00:03:42.620> sure<00:03:42.889> when<00:03:43.190> you're<00:03:43.310> doing<00:03:43.669> goddess

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
to make sure when you're doing goddess

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.309 
to make sure when you're doing goddess
base<00:03:44.180> because<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:44.569> parts<00:03:44.840> are<00:03:44.930> so<00:03:45.049> thick<00:03:45.290> that

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
base because the parts are so thick that

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.370 
base because the parts are so thick that
you<00:03:45.500> keep<00:03:45.919> the<00:03:46.099> hair<00:03:46.310> detangled<00:03:47.169> that<00:03:48.169> you're

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
you keep the hair detangled that you're

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.800 
you keep the hair detangled that you're
working<00:03:48.560> with<00:03:49.299> sometimes<00:03:50.299> you<00:03:50.419> might<00:03:50.540> have<00:03:50.690> to

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
working with sometimes you might have to

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.120 
working with sometimes you might have to
stop<00:03:51.079> and<00:03:51.260> comb<00:03:51.440> it<00:03:51.470> out<00:03:51.709> a<00:03:51.739> little<00:03:51.980> bit

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
stop and comb it out a little bit

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.620 
stop and comb it out a little bit
depending<00:03:52.700> on<00:03:52.790> if<00:03:52.940> it's<00:03:53.090> wet<00:03:53.269> or<00:03:53.389> dry

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
depending on if it's wet or dry

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.650 
depending on if it's wet or dry
I<00:03:53.900> like<00:03:54.560> braiding<00:03:54.980> hair<00:03:55.130> wet<00:03:55.549> because<00:03:56.389> it

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
I like braiding hair wet because it

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.699 
I like braiding hair wet because it
tends<00:03:57.260> to<00:03:57.819> tighten<00:03:58.819> up<00:03:58.970> and<00:03:59.209> look<00:04:00.109> smoother

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
tends to tighten up and look smoother

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.670 
tends to tighten up and look smoother
but<00:04:01.130> I<00:04:01.310> can<00:04:01.549> read<00:04:01.819> dry<00:04:02.329> or<00:04:02.720> wet<00:04:02.780> doesn't

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
but I can read dry or wet doesn't

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.430 
but I can read dry or wet doesn't
matters<00:04:03.919> and<00:04:04.340> depending<00:04:04.970> on<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.150> style<00:04:05.450> would

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
matters and depending on the style would

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.500 
matters and depending on the style would
determine<00:04:07.190> whether<00:04:07.819> you<00:04:08.000> want<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.299> hair<00:04:08.480> to

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
determine whether you want the hair to

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.319 
determine whether you want the hair to
be<00:04:08.690> wet<00:04:09.079> or<00:04:09.200> dry
