00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:02.540 

so<00:00:01.110> in<00:00:01.260> this<00:00:01.380> tutorial<00:00:01.650> I'm<00:00:02.159> going<00:00:02.280> to<00:00:02.340> show

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
so in this tutorial I'm going to show

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.150 
so in this tutorial I'm going to show
you<00:00:02.610> guys<00:00:02.850> how<00:00:02.909> to<00:00:03.179> to<00:00:03.899> draw<00:00:04.259> your<00:00:04.470> your<00:00:04.859> base

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
you guys how to to draw your your base

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.740 
you guys how to to draw your your base
of<00:00:05.370> your<00:00:05.490> car<00:00:05.759> and<00:00:06.029> that's<00:00:06.120> basically<00:00:06.629> the

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
of your car and that's basically the

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.759 
of your car and that's basically the
wheels<00:00:08.150> so<00:00:09.150> I<00:00:09.179> start<00:00:09.450> out<00:00:09.510> drawing<00:00:09.840> my<00:00:10.260> axles

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
wheels so I start out drawing my axles

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.910 
wheels so I start out drawing my axles
first<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.540> what<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:12.570> do<00:00:12.690> with<00:00:12.960> my<00:00:13.110> axles<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.799> I

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
first and what I do with my axles is I

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.240 
first and what I do with my axles is I
draw<00:00:14.509> they<00:00:15.509> also<00:00:15.630> act<00:00:15.900> as<00:00:16.020> my<00:00:16.250> perspective

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
draw they also act as my perspective

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.359 
draw they also act as my perspective
guidelines<00:00:18.380> so<00:00:19.380> I'm<00:00:19.680> drawing<00:00:19.949> my<00:00:20.100> first

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
guidelines so I'm drawing my first

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.630 
guidelines so I'm drawing my first
ellipse<00:00:20.760> here<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.210> this<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:22.400> showing<00:00:23.400> how<00:00:23.580> the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
ellipse here and this is showing how the

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.089 
ellipse here and this is showing how the
the<00:00:24.210> minor<00:00:24.480> axis<00:00:24.750> which<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.650> short<00:00:25.949> one

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
the minor axis which is the short one

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.000 
the minor axis which is the short one
the<00:00:26.400> first<00:00:26.580> one<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:26.880> drew<00:00:27.349> lines<00:00:28.349> up<00:00:28.590> 90<00:00:28.980> degrees

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
the first one I drew lines up 90 degrees

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.380 
the first one I drew lines up 90 degrees
to<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.699> major<00:00:30.029> axis<00:00:30.660> which<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.439> longest

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
to the major axis which is the longest

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.389 
to the major axis which is the longest
and<00:00:33.390> that's<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.079> top<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.770> bottom<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:35.280> the

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
and that's the top to the bottom of the

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.410 
and that's the top to the bottom of the
ellipse<00:00:37.489> then<00:00:38.489> if<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.730> notice<00:00:38.910> I'll<00:00:39.180> draw<00:00:39.390> a

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
ellipse then if you notice I'll draw a

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.470 
ellipse then if you notice I'll draw a
lot<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.719> wheels<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.260> between<00:00:40.770> my<00:00:40.920> other<00:00:41.100> wheels

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
lot of wheels in between my other wheels

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.080 
lot of wheels in between my other wheels
not<00:00:42.480> only<00:00:42.719> are<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.020> wheels<00:00:43.640> act<00:00:44.640> as<00:00:44.940> your

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
not only are the wheels act as your

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.299 
not only are the wheels act as your
perspective<00:00:45.719> guidelines<00:00:46.200> when<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.070> draw<00:00:47.280> the

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
perspective guidelines when you draw the

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.049 
perspective guidelines when you draw the
axle<00:00:47.850> but<00:00:48.000> they<00:00:48.629> also<00:00:48.840> give<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:51.649> proportions

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
axle but they also give you proportions

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.700 
axle but they also give you proportions
when<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.180> draw<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> side<00:00:54.719> view<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.110> car<00:00:55.410> you

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
when you draw a side view of a car you

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.680 
when you draw a side view of a car you
can<00:00:56.160> actually<00:00:56.340> measure<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.940> whole<00:00:57.120> car<00:00:57.390> just

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
can actually measure the whole car just

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.049 
can actually measure the whole car just
by<00:00:57.840> drawing<00:00:58.109> wheels<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.890> then<00:00:59.640> when<00:00:59.760> you<00:00:59.879> draw

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
by drawing wheels and then when you draw

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.479 
by drawing wheels and then when you draw
it<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.270> perspective<00:01:01.010> you<00:01:02.010> draw<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.340> same

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
it in perspective you draw the same

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.149 
it in perspective you draw the same
amount<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.059> wheels<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.780> know<00:01:03.899> distance<00:01:04.799> apart

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
amount of wheels you know distance apart

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.170 
amount of wheels you know distance apart
width<00:01:06.000> wise<00:01:06.740> so<00:01:07.740> this<00:01:07.950> car<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.250> approximately

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
width wise so this car is approximately

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.600 
width wise so this car is approximately
4<00:01:09.450> wheels<00:01:09.689> from<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.439> front<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.010> back<00:01:11.130> in

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
4 wheels from the front to the back in

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.600 
4 wheels from the front to the back in
between<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.600> beat<00:01:13.290> there's<00:01:13.950> four<00:01:14.369> wheels

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
between the and beat there's four wheels

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.640 
between the and beat there's four wheels
in<00:01:14.850> between<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.420> front<00:01:15.689> wheel<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.470> back

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
in between the front wheel and the back

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.240 
in between the front wheel and the back
wheel<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:17.700> tells<00:01:17.970> how<00:01:18.210> long<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.689> car<00:01:18.930> is

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
wheel so that tells how long the car is

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.820 
wheel so that tells how long the car is
then<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.430> width<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:21.090> average<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.170> car<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.680> about

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
then the width on average a car is about

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.690 
then the width on average a car is about
two-and-a-half<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:24.180> three<00:01:24.509> wheels<00:01:24.780> wide<00:01:25.700> and

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
two-and-a-half to three wheels wide and

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.490 
two-and-a-half to three wheels wide and
then<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:26.970> depends<00:01:27.390> also<00:01:27.570> on<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.020> kind<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.259> car

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
then it depends also on the kind of car

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.380 
then it depends also on the kind of car
you're<00:01:28.680> drawn<00:01:28.890> if<00:01:29.040> you're<00:01:29.159> drawn<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.610> sports

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
you're drawn if you're drawn a sports

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.270 
you're drawn if you're drawn a sports
car<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.869> know<00:01:30.960> that's<00:01:31.170> kind<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.770> rule<00:01:31.950> but

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
car you know that's kind of the rule but

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.310 
car you know that's kind of the rule but
if<00:01:32.700> you're<00:01:32.970> drawn<00:01:33.210> like<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.450> tank<00:01:33.810> or<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.110> big

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
if you're drawn like a tank or a big

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.410 
if you're drawn like a tank or a big
semi-truck<00:01:35.130> or<00:01:35.579> something<00:01:35.850> like<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.000> you

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
semi-truck or something like that you

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.179 
semi-truck or something like that you
know<00:01:36.570> they<00:01:37.200> can<00:01:37.380> actually<00:01:37.560> be<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.829> little<00:01:38.070> bit

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
know they can actually be a little bit

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.580 
know they can actually be a little bit
wider<00:01:38.930> so<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.820> get<00:01:41.820> my<00:01:41.939> guidelines<00:01:42.450> down<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.110> it

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
wider so I get my guidelines down and it

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.399 
wider so I get my guidelines down and it
really<00:01:43.950> helps<00:01:44.310> me<00:01:44.479> it<00:01:45.479> helps<00:01:45.509> me<00:01:46.020> figure<00:01:46.259> out

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
really helps me it helps me figure out

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.130 
really helps me it helps me figure out
where<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.460> other<00:01:47.490> side<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.689> car<00:01:48.960> is

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
where the other side of the the car is

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.359 
where the other side of the the car is
and<00:01:49.409> where<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.619> other<00:01:49.740> wheels<00:01:50.040> go<00:01:51.649> and<00:01:52.649> I

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
and where the other wheels go and I

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.030 
and where the other wheels go and I
always<00:01:53.700> draw<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:55.020> know<00:01:55.140> all<00:01:55.350> my<00:01:55.500> guidelines

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
always draw you know all my guidelines

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.600 
always draw you know all my guidelines
so<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.390> know<00:01:58.290> where<00:01:58.649> everything<00:01:59.040> lines<00:01:59.340> up

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
so that I know where everything lines up

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.389 
so that I know where everything lines up
and<00:01:59.869> that<00:02:00.869> gives<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.290> good<00:02:01.590> solid<00:02:01.920> sketch

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
and that gives you a good solid sketch

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.380 
and that gives you a good solid sketch
that<00:02:02.640> way<00:02:02.880> instead<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.570> just<00:02:03.689> drawing<00:02:04.340> lines

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
that way instead of just drawing lines

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.340 
that way instead of just drawing lines
and<00:02:06.390> hoping<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:06.810> you're<00:02:07.020> getting<00:02:07.229> the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
and hoping that you're getting the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.419 
and hoping that you're getting the
perspective<00:02:07.649> right

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
perspective right

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.760 
perspective right
I<00:02:08.899> even<00:02:09.950> that<00:02:10.950> line<00:02:11.220> there's<00:02:12.020> basically<00:02:13.020> my

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
I even that line there's basically my

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.310 
I even that line there's basically my
in<00:02:13.830> line<00:02:14.100> that's<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.150> middle<00:02:15.420> of<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.720> car<00:02:15.960> so

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
in line that's the middle of the car so

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.410 
in line that's the middle of the car so
I<00:02:16.350> know<00:02:16.470> where<00:02:16.770> things<00:02:16.950> line<00:02:17.250> up<00:02:20.300> then<00:02:21.300> I'm

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
I know where things line up then I'm

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.750 
I know where things line up then I'm
going<00:02:21.570> to<00:02:21.660> draw<00:02:21.900> another<00:02:22.340> perspective<00:02:23.340> just

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
going to draw another perspective just

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.820 
going to draw another perspective just
to<00:02:23.940> show<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.150> how<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.780> just<00:02:24.810> always<00:02:25.440> use<00:02:25.650> this

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
to show you how you just always use this

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.720 
to show you how you just always use this
rule<00:02:26.070> always<00:02:26.700> always<00:02:26.940> always<00:02:27.240> and<00:02:28.460> see<00:02:29.460> here<00:02:29.700> I

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
rule always always always and see here I

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.270 
rule always always always and see here I
actually<00:02:29.970> drew<00:02:30.450> my<00:02:30.630> wheel<00:02:31.380> first<00:02:31.770> so<00:02:32.100> then<00:02:32.250> I

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
actually drew my wheel first so then I

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.740 
actually drew my wheel first so then I
draw<00:02:32.580> my<00:02:32.730> axle<00:02:33.230> through<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.710> minor<00:02:34.950> axis

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.260 

so<00:02:39.750> there's<00:02:39.930> my<00:02:40.080> minor<00:02:40.350> axis<00:02:40.830> there<00:02:41.070> and<00:02:41.970> then

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
so there's my minor axis there and then

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.070 
so there's my minor axis there and then
continuing<00:02:42.750> across<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.530> that's<00:02:43.980> my<00:02:44.250> axle<00:02:44.730> and

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
continuing across and that's my axle and

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.610 
continuing across and that's my axle and
then<00:02:46.080> draw<00:02:46.290> my<00:02:46.500> major<00:02:46.740> guideline<00:02:48.440> so<00:02:49.440> that's

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
then draw my major guideline so that's

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:56.510 
then draw my major guideline so that's
my<00:02:49.770> major<00:02:49.980> axis<00:02:50.610> this<00:02:51.360> is<00:02:51.420> my<00:02:51.720> minor<00:02:51.990> axis<00:02:55.520> so

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
my major axis this is my minor axis so

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.570 
my major axis this is my minor axis so
that's<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.940> shortest<00:02:57.360> distance<00:02:57.570> on<00:02:58.050> the<00:02:59.040> the

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
that's the shortest distance on the the

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.310 
that's the shortest distance on the the
oval<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:01.160> then<00:03:02.160> this<00:03:02.700> is<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.320> longest

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
oval and then this is the longest

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.730 
oval and then this is the longest
distance<00:03:05.160> on<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.760> oval<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:06.470> basically<00:03:07.470> that

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
distance on the oval and basically that

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.150 
distance on the oval and basically that
helps<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:08.220> get<00:03:08.580> your<00:03:08.640> correct<00:03:09.710> tilt<00:03:10.710> on<00:03:10.950> the

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
helps you get your correct tilt on the

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.430 
helps you get your correct tilt on the
wheel<00:03:11.400> I<00:03:11.700> know<00:03:12.600> a<00:03:12.720> lot<00:03:12.900> of<00:03:12.930> times<00:03:13.230> I<00:03:13.380> think

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
wheel I know a lot of times I think

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.920 
wheel I know a lot of times I think
people<00:03:14.100> just<00:03:14.970> guess<00:03:15.180> at<00:03:15.420> what<00:03:15.570> the<00:03:15.600> wheel

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
people just guess at what the wheel

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.360 
people just guess at what the wheel
should<00:03:16.200> look<00:03:16.440> like<00:03:16.470> but<00:03:16.860> this<00:03:16.980> gives<00:03:17.220> you<00:03:17.340> a

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
should look like but this gives you a

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.820 
should look like but this gives you a
guideline<00:03:17.730> on<00:03:18.120> how<00:03:18.390> you<00:03:19.140> need<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.470> lay<00:03:19.620> down

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
guideline on how you need to lay down

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.080 
guideline on how you need to lay down
your<00:03:19.980> car<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:20.550> I<00:03:21.420> always<00:03:21.900> draw<00:03:22.170> my<00:03:22.350> cars

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
your car and I always draw my cars

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.449 
your car and I always draw my cars
drawing<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.270> wheels<00:03:24.510> first<00:03:25.070> because<00:03:26.070> it's<00:03:26.250> it

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
drawing the wheels first because it's it

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.690 
drawing the wheels first because it's it
acts<00:03:27.270> as<00:03:27.480> a<00:03:27.510> perspective<00:03:28.260> device<00:03:28.740> as<00:03:29.010> well<00:03:29.490> as

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
acts as a perspective device as well as

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.180 
acts as a perspective device as well as
a<00:03:29.730> proportion<00:03:30.390> device<00:03:30.720> and<00:03:31.620> you<00:03:31.770> need<00:03:31.920> both<00:03:31.980> of

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
a proportion device and you need both of

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.500 
a proportion device and you need both of
those<00:03:32.459> things<00:03:32.700> when<00:03:32.970> you're<00:03:33.120> when<00:03:33.480> you're

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
those things when you're when you're

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.620 
those things when you're when you're
sketching<00:03:34.520> your<00:03:35.520> vehicles<00:03:38.060> so<00:03:39.060> then<00:03:39.240> I<00:03:39.330> draw

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
sketching your vehicles so then I draw

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.050 
sketching your vehicles so then I draw
you<00:03:40.440> know<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.709> axle<00:03:41.160> again<00:03:41.459> and<00:03:41.700> then<00:03:41.790> I<00:03:41.820> draw

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
you know the axle again and then I draw

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.180 
you know the axle again and then I draw
the<00:03:42.120> top<00:03:42.480> and<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:43.170> bottom<00:03:43.380> of<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.800> tire<00:03:43.980> and

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
the top and the bottom of the tire and

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:51.650 
the top and the bottom of the tire and
where<00:03:44.370> they<00:03:44.459> meet<00:03:47.780> and<00:03:49.340> this<00:03:50.340> here<00:03:50.790> just<00:03:51.480> to

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
where they meet and this here just to

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.630 
where they meet and this here just to
explain<00:03:52.020> a<00:03:52.050> little<00:03:52.230> bit<00:03:52.410> degrees<00:03:53.040> on<00:03:53.310> wheels

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
explain a little bit degrees on wheels

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.660 
explain a little bit degrees on wheels
the<00:03:54.330> mid<00:03:54.630> wheel<00:03:55.170> is<00:03:55.500> the<00:03:55.650> always<00:03:56.100> the<00:03:56.250> closest

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
the mid wheel is the always the closest

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.080 
the mid wheel is the always the closest
one<00:03:56.940> to<00:03:57.120> you<00:03:57.209> which<00:03:57.390> is<00:03:57.570> the<00:03:57.690> middle<00:03:58.820> degree<00:03:59.820> of

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
one to you which is the middle degree of

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.900 
one to you which is the middle degree of
the<00:04:00.510> wheel<00:04:00.780> and<00:04:01.110> the<00:04:01.260> degrees<00:04:01.740> are<00:04:02.040> reference

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
the wheel and the degrees are reference

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.830 
the wheel and the degrees are reference
to<00:04:03.840> when<00:04:04.020> you<00:04:04.140> use<00:04:04.170> circle<00:04:04.680> templates<00:04:05.130> so<00:04:05.840> the

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
to when you use circle templates so the

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.120 
to when you use circle templates so the
mid<00:04:07.110> is<00:04:07.380> usually<00:04:09.500> obviously<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.620> middle<00:04:10.950> of

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
mid is usually obviously the middle of

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.840 
mid is usually obviously the middle of
all<00:04:12.120> the<00:04:12.450> the<00:04:13.260> other<00:04:13.410> two<00:04:13.680> wheels<00:04:13.980> so<00:04:14.489> then<00:04:14.700> you

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
all the the other two wheels so then you

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.060 
all the the other two wheels so then you
have<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:15.810> farthest<00:04:16.260> wheel<00:04:16.500> which<00:04:16.770> is<00:04:16.950> the

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
have the farthest wheel which is the

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.659 
have the farthest wheel which is the
most<00:04:17.280> open<00:04:17.580> and<00:04:18.830> you<00:04:19.830> only<00:04:19.950> worry<00:04:20.250> about<00:04:20.340> that

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
most open and you only worry about that

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.460 
most open and you only worry about that
wheel<00:04:20.910> if<00:04:21.180> it's<00:04:21.359> an<00:04:21.450> open-wheel<00:04:21.870> car<00:04:22.229> because

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
wheel if it's an open-wheel car because

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.750 
wheel if it's an open-wheel car because
you'll<00:04:22.590> see<00:04:22.770> that<00:04:22.890> wheel<00:04:23.100> on<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.400> other<00:04:23.430> side

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
you'll see that wheel on the other side

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.780 
you'll see that wheel on the other side
and<00:04:24.060> then<00:04:24.990> the<00:04:25.110> narrowest<00:04:25.590> is<00:04:25.919> your<00:04:26.220> most

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
and then the narrowest is your most

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
and then the narrowest is your most
skinniest

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
skinniest

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.170 
skinniest
wiill<00:04:28.110> it's<00:04:28.500> that<00:04:29.220> you<00:04:29.430> see<00:04:29.639> less<00:04:29.880> of<00:04:30.060> the

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
wiill it's that you see less of the

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.230 
wiill it's that you see less of the
surface<00:04:30.570> area<00:04:30.900> and<00:04:31.220> then<00:04:32.220> so<00:04:32.700> the<00:04:32.820> mid<00:04:33.060> is

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
surface area and then so the mid is

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.740 
surface area and then so the mid is
usually<00:04:33.660> approximately<00:04:34.350> about<00:04:34.710> 45<00:04:35.460> 40<00:04:36.120> to<00:04:36.240> 45

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
usually approximately about 45 40 to 45

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.129 
usually approximately about 45 40 to 45
degrees<00:04:37.230> and<00:04:37.590> then<00:04:38.430> to<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.270> back<00:04:39.510> is<00:04:39.840> about<00:04:39.990> a

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
degrees and then to the back is about a

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:43.090 
degrees and then to the back is about a
15<00:04:40.530> 10<00:04:41.310> to<00:04:41.460> 15<00:04:41.820> degree<00:04:42.180> difference<00:04:42.660> and

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
15 10 to 15 degree difference and

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:49.060 
15 10 to 15 degree difference and
usually<00:04:44.100> those<00:04:44.250> are<00:04:44.280> about<00:04:44.610> 25<00:04:45.240> to<00:04:46.430> 20<00:04:47.430> degree

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
usually those are about 25 to 20 degree

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.830 
usually those are about 25 to 20 degree
wheel<00:04:50.070> in<00:04:50.340> the<00:04:50.580> back<00:04:50.790> and<00:04:51.060> then<00:04:51.389> the<00:04:51.510> other<00:04:51.720> the

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
wheel in the back and then the other the

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.430 
wheel in the back and then the other the
most<00:04:52.320> open<00:04:52.680> is<00:04:52.800> about<00:04:53.040> 50<00:04:53.490> to<00:04:53.610> 55<00:04:54.110> so<00:04:55.110> all<00:04:55.290> the

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
most open is about 50 to 55 so all the

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.990 
most open is about 50 to 55 so all the
wheels<00:04:55.680> are<00:04:55.919> about<00:04:56.100> 10<00:04:56.430> to<00:04:56.550> 15<00:04:56.970> degrees

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
wheels are about 10 to 15 degrees

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.409 
wheels are about 10 to 15 degrees
difference<00:04:57.870> and<00:04:58.850> you'll<00:04:59.850> learn<00:05:00.000> that<00:05:00.210> stuff

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
difference and you'll learn that stuff

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:08.060 
difference and you'll learn that stuff
by<00:05:00.720> using<00:05:00.990> circle<00:05:01.440> templates<00:05:05.360> and<00:05:06.710> this<00:05:07.710> here

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
by using circle templates and this here

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.500 
by using circle templates and this here
this<00:05:08.250> is<00:05:08.460> I'm<00:05:08.610> just<00:05:08.639> shown<00:05:09.000> that<00:05:09.030> this<00:05:09.360> is

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
this is I'm just shown that this is

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.830 
this is I'm just shown that this is
always<00:05:09.750> 90<00:05:10.110> degrees<00:05:10.590> on<00:05:10.620> the<00:05:10.950> major<00:05:11.160> and<00:05:11.520> the

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
always 90 degrees on the major and the

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:21.700 
always 90 degrees on the major and the
minor<00:05:12.840> axis<00:05:15.919> so<00:05:16.919> this<00:05:17.160> is<00:05:17.310> your<00:05:17.460> major<00:05:17.669> axis

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.090 

then<00:05:22.710> this<00:05:23.010> is<00:05:23.310> your<00:05:23.580> minor<00:05:24.090> axis<00:05:25.100> always

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
then this is your minor axis always

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.920 
then this is your minor axis always
remember<00:05:26.490> that<00:05:26.669> role<00:05:26.910> major<00:05:27.210> minor<00:05:27.600> major

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
remember that role major minor major

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.310 
remember that role major minor major
minor<00:05:28.350> and<00:05:28.700> you'll<00:05:29.700> always<00:05:29.940> if<00:05:30.360> you<00:05:30.720> get<00:05:31.169> this

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
minor and you'll always if you get this

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.020 
minor and you'll always if you get this
rule<00:05:31.620> down<00:05:31.860> you'll<00:05:32.100> always<00:05:32.250> have<00:05:32.640> your<00:05:32.789> wheels

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
rule down you'll always have your wheels

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.420 
rule down you'll always have your wheels
lined<00:05:33.330> up<00:05:33.510> right<00:05:33.780> and<00:05:33.990> it'll<00:05:34.470> also<00:05:34.919> line<00:05:35.250> up

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
lined up right and it'll also line up

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.240 
lined up right and it'll also line up
the<00:05:35.610> rest<00:05:35.850> of<00:05:36.000> your<00:05:36.120> car<00:05:36.330> right<00:05:36.510> and<00:05:36.919> so<00:05:37.919> that's

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
the rest of your car right and so that's

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.659 
the rest of your car right and so that's
your<00:05:38.550> and<00:05:39.260> your<00:05:40.260> minor<00:05:40.470> axis<00:05:40.950> is<00:05:41.130> always<00:05:41.520> your

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
your and your minor axis is always your

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:47.050 
your and your minor axis is always your
axial<00:05:42.440> help<00:05:43.440> if<00:05:43.590> I<00:05:43.680> can<00:05:43.890> spell<00:05:44.160> it<00:05:44.310> right

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.659 

so<00:05:48.060> that's<00:05:48.300> your<00:05:48.650> axial<00:05:49.650> and<00:05:49.830> when<00:05:50.430> you<00:05:50.520> lay

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
so that's your axial and when you lay

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:52.070 
so that's your axial and when you lay
down<00:05:50.700> your<00:05:51.000> axial<00:05:51.419> and<00:05:51.479> your<00:05:51.630> wheels<00:05:51.810> that

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
down your axial and your wheels that

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.950 
down your axial and your wheels that
gives<00:05:52.320> basically<00:05:52.950> a<00:05:53.190> good<00:05:54.030> grid<00:05:54.419> to<00:05:54.600> go<00:05:54.780> off

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
gives basically a good grid to go off

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.650 
gives basically a good grid to go off
and<00:05:55.320> you<00:05:55.710> can<00:05:55.890> start<00:05:56.190> sketching<00:05:56.490> in<00:05:56.850> any<00:05:57.360> shape

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
and you can start sketching in any shape

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.990 
and you can start sketching in any shape
you<00:05:57.810> want<00:05:57.840> you<00:05:58.289> know<00:05:58.440> that's<00:05:59.160> the<00:05:59.430> the<00:05:59.789> nice
