00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:13.610
 hello guys today I wanted to teach you in the 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.710
 video how to pass a lipstick that is broken 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.590
 or that you want it intervened to a 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:22.849
 box like this or this is the result 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:25.939
 final so it stays is super good and 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:28.279
 then that's why you put it with your finger or what 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.470
 you put with a brush of equal and good 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.759
 Well, if you 're interested in the video here 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.040
 are the materials that we are going to 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:37.010
 need are a candle a spoon of 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.870
 metal lipsticks and a box where 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.270
 we will keep the lipstick the candle that 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.950
 I used it I bought it in primark and it's 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.850
 a candle that lasts 10 hours with 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.199
 smell of lavender 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.199
 we light the candle 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.089
 and we choose the lipstick we want 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.710
 use 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:04.629
 I have chosen this kiko lipstick 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.189
 that is very old indeed that does not 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.680
 I know how I got to this state is 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:11.080
 horrible is how full you see hard shell 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.890
 if the bar split and does a lot of 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.890
 time I have it 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.470
 with the help of a cutter or a knife that 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.830
 let's have at home we cut the bar 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.830
 lipstick 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.580
 not make too to spoon 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.530
 the flame because if it is not it will go out 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.090
 then keep some feelings of 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.100
 distance and hopes that the 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.400
 lipstick completely without getting 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.400
 To boil 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.940
 we have done this the only thing that we have 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:26.160
 What to do is take the box and put 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:27.690
 all the liquid in it and good is already 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.050
 now we just have to wait for a 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.050
 minute 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.510
 and this is the final result now 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.870
 is completely solidified and ready 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.870
 to use 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.310

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.620
