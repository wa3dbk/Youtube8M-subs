00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:16.250
 and we are very happy battle of 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.990
 puebla poblanos 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.439
 today and what is that we do this 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.390
 stew and this of the this happened as 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.040
 some stews that moms made and I 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.200
 love doing it yes I love to enjoy 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.290
 and the best thing I like to eat me 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:34.810
 I'm starting to fry choricito the one 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:38.350
 have at home smell and taste delicious 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:41.620
 and notice that I'm out there today one day 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.660
 I do not know how to fry the chorizo 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.840
 it should be hydrated with so much water 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.910
 without seeing we are going to experience it seriously to 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.490
 see how it is going because it gives you time to 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.650
 here a few balls because if you 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.240
 add more fat to the chorizo 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.730
 soon we will do it like this I can 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.260
 years ago we made homemade chorizo ​​and what 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.800
 I will again be because many people I 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.080
 he has asked for it 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.510
 I'm going to put a little bit of water 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.120
 and we are going to raise the fire so that 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.940
 go cooking this a little more 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.820
 chorizo ​​and well I have chicken previously 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.700
 Cooked and unraveled a lot of things Daddy 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.560
 is the fight and cut of cubes to 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.150
 disproportionate a bit but always 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.630
 maintaining the same symmetry 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.390
 squares are ready and look how 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.800
 they start like releasing their juices and 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.160
 that I want him to release his juices 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.050
 when when we believe it they do not release 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.210
 so much juice if here it looks like the 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.660
 caldito that is staying there is being 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.880
 impregnated with this delicious taste 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.760
 and I think it's a better idea to add water 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.240
 that fry the water around here, look how 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:51.390
 is the caldito is changing color 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:54.470
 We are making stews very poblano me 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.030
 it seems good idea to make them 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.950
 We are going to put this here, we are not going to 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.320
 waste and I'm going to take out my pot 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.930
 because we need it to do the 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.930
 next step I will put oil 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.489
 to heated 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.810
 and I'm going to put a piece of onion that 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.980
 by the way I'm going to apply a little 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.980
 more so that it is faster 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:42.910
 I'm going to put garlic with everything and skin 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.910
 with a little more onion 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.560
 and I'm going to move them to my mole that I look 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.320
 as it is beginning to change already of 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.330
 color look like here in the center already 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.220
 it has a more green color 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.990
 avocado we can still see the 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.570
 difference between one and the other 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:07.300
 how delicious and tasty and something that 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.160
 he failed to tell them was that please when 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.580
 are going to make you a fund like 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.400
 chicken background for no reason 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.070
 no reason why do you go to this one 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.580
 put salt because the funds are never 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.580
 put salt 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.090
 I'm almost ready to add my 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.090
 onion 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.420
 Feijoo technique seeing look nothing 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.980
 It's a very Chinese technique but to me 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.329
 agrees at this time because what 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.069
 I want it to be very well fried and not 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:47.010
 I want him to burn because if I 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:49.230
 will burn the flavor of what 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.590
 bitter that transmits the burned we do not 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.590
 like 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.550
 well nothing but rich 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.360
 and since I am very cautious 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.740
 I already have some tweezers here 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:13.910
 my onion is perfectly well fried 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.910
 this aj is going to see what we are going to do 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.890
 I told them that I already have a chick 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.930
 crumbled if you do not want it 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.540
 to use also you can leave a few 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.150
 thighs but I do not like breast 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.460
 I think the taste of the thigh is much more 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:34.680
 rich 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.210
 then from the menu of thighs 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.820
 I do not want to leave anything this onion 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.479
 also here we are going to lower what 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.479
 towards the fire 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:49.229
 and I'm going to liquify all this 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:51.899
 but let's peel my eyes the best 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:54.289
 way for a garlic is putting this 

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:54.289
 way 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.210
 texas see how easy 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.360
 a little funny but it 's the best 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.360
 way 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:21.379
 the flavor that we are giving right now 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.939
 me to my sauce to me caldito that is going to be 

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:25.849
 to my puree to me caldillo that I will have 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:27.439
 is completely different from the one 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:30.560
 we are accustomed to the taste of garlic 

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:33.729
 he changes all the wheat the freire the 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.729
 cabbage changes with the taste 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:48.759
 we are ready 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:48.759
 and I loved the smell 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:01.860
 again me and what I like the most in 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:01.860
 the kitchen 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:09.629
 terrific ready 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.750
 and with another spoon so that I do not 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:17.190
 scold I will try at once how it goes 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.190

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:25.139
 no the mole will love some 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.139
 hot tortillas 

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:30.880
