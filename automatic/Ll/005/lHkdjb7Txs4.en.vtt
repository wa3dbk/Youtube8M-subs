looks<00:00:31.380> very<00:00:31.590> very<00:00:31.740> strong<00:00:32.340> because<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.910> the

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
looks very very strong because of the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.360 
looks very very strong because of the
amount<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.540> weight<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:34.079> he's<00:00:34.559> lifting<00:00:35.010> but

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
amount of weight that he's lifting but

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.600 
amount of weight that he's lifting but
yet<00:00:35.640> his<00:00:36.180> gains<00:00:36.570> do<00:00:37.140> not<00:00:37.380> show<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.770> his<00:00:38.309> gains

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
weight that he's lifting there might be

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.040 
weight that he's lifting there might be
a<00:00:42.059> very<00:00:42.420> very<00:00:44.180> different<00:00:45.180> looking<00:00:45.450> guy<00:00:45.660> that

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
a very very different looking guy that

a very very different looking guy that
has<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.200> lot<00:00:46.469> more<00:00:46.649> muscle<00:00:46.920> on<00:00:47.250> him<00:00:47.520> standing

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
has a lot more muscle on him standing

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.430 
has a lot more muscle on him standing
right<00:00:48.149> beside<00:00:48.329> him<00:00:48.629> that's<00:00:48.870> lifting<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.260> lot

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
right beside him that's lifting a lot

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.220 
right beside him that's lifting a lot
less<00:00:49.710> weight<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.370> we<00:00:50.940> want<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.210> expose<00:00:51.719> why

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
less weight and we want to expose why

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.350 
less weight and we want to expose why

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
be the guy that has the muscle or the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.119 
be the guy that has the muscle or the
guy<00:00:59.820> that<00:01:00.120> has<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.690> strength<00:01:01.020> okay<00:01:01.859> there's

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
guy that has the strength okay there's

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.880 
guy that has the strength okay there's
two<00:01:02.579> different<00:01:02.760> things<00:01:03.180> they're<00:01:03.780> not<00:01:04.140> 100%

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
two different things they're not 100%

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.120 
two different things they're not 100%
related<00:01:05.670> okay<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.210> we'll<00:01:06.299> explain<00:01:06.659> why<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.350> I

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
related okay and we'll explain why and I

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.020 
related okay and we'll explain why and I
think<00:01:08.430> you'll<00:01:08.549> have<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.670> lot<00:01:08.850> better

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
think you'll have a lot better

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.960 
think you'll have a lot better
understanding<00:01:09.750> about<00:01:09.869> how<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.920> train<00:01:11.400> for

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
understanding about how to train for

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.240 
understanding about how to train for
muscle<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.600> how<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.869> train<00:01:13.229> for<00:01:13.260> strength<00:01:13.830> you

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
muscle and how to train for strength you

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.070 
muscle and how to train for strength you
know<00:01:14.340> pass<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.729> on<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.939> Aaron<00:01:15.270> here<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.659> explain

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
know pass it on to Aaron here to explain

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.740 
know pass it on to Aaron here to explain
a<00:01:16.140> few<00:01:16.229> concepts<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.939> basically<00:01:18.360> when

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
a few concepts to you so basically when

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.870 
a few concepts to you so basically when
you're<00:01:18.900> in<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.110> gym<00:01:19.369> your<00:01:20.369> goal<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.850> to

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
you're in the gym your goal is to

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.820 
you're in the gym your goal is to
actually<00:01:21.060> pack<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.689> lot<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:21.960> size<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.470> want

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
actually pack on a lot of size you want

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.530 
actually pack on a lot of size you want
to<00:01:22.890> stimulate<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.340> muscle<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.210> means

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
to stimulate the muscle so that means

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.289 
to stimulate the muscle so that means
you<00:01:24.689> want<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.900> be<00:01:25.350> explosive<00:01:25.909> keep<00:01:26.909> tension<00:01:27.150> on

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
you want to be explosive keep tension on

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.630 
you want to be explosive keep tension on
the<00:01:27.360> muscle<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.780> entire<00:01:28.080> time<00:01:28.520> control<00:01:29.520> the

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
the muscle the entire time control the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.370 
the muscle the entire time control the
negative<00:01:29.939> all<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.450> important<00:01:30.900> key<00:01:31.110> things

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
negative all the important key things

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.330 
negative all the important key things
they're<00:01:31.560> gonna<00:01:31.680> break<00:01:31.920> down<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.159> muscle

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
they're gonna break down the muscle

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.060 
they're gonna break down the muscle
fibers<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.030> trigger<00:01:33.540> muscular<00:01:34.049> growth<00:01:34.200> so

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
fibers and trigger muscular growth so

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.100 
fibers and trigger muscular growth so
the<00:01:35.340> problem<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.850> all<00:01:36.150> these<00:01:36.270> guys<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.750> lifting

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
the problem is all these guys is lifting

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.499 
the problem is all these guys is lifting
heavy<00:01:37.290> weight<00:01:37.530> they're<00:01:37.950> using<00:01:38.280> momentum

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
heavy weight they're using momentum

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.999 
heavy weight they're using momentum
momentum<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:40.170> actually<00:01:40.470> move<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:40.799> weight

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
momentum to actually move this weight

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.980 
momentum to actually move this weight
you<00:01:41.280> need<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.759> let<00:01:41.880> your<00:01:42.030> muscles<00:01:42.390> do<00:01:42.689> all<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
you need to let your muscles do all the

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.020 
you need to let your muscles do all the
work<00:01:43.170> complement<00:01:43.860> them<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.490> you've<00:01:44.850> seen

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
work complement them so you've seen

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.700 
work complement them so you've seen
these<00:01:45.210> guys<00:01:45.420> they're<00:01:46.020> slugging<00:01:46.350> around<00:01:46.560> you

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
these guys they're slugging around you

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.899 
these guys they're slugging around you
know<00:01:46.799> twice<00:01:47.009> as<00:01:47.159> much<00:01:47.280> weight<00:01:47.460> as<00:01:47.670> anybody

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
know twice as much weight as anybody

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.510 
know twice as much weight as anybody
else<00:01:48.060> but<00:01:48.689> they're<00:01:48.840> just<00:01:48.990> swinging<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:50.399> know

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
else but they're just swinging you know

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.219 
else but they're just swinging you know
they're<00:01:50.820> bouncing<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.689> weight<00:01:51.840> doing<00:01:52.079> the

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
they're bouncing the weight doing the

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.200 
they're bouncing the weight doing the
things<00:01:52.409> like<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.680> just<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.850> know<00:01:53.939> train

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
things like this just to you know train

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.120 
things like this just to you know train
their<00:01:54.360> ego<00:01:54.689> rather<00:01:54.930> than<00:01:55.110> their<00:01:55.229> muscles<00:01:55.560> well

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
their ego rather than their muscles well

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.920 
their ego rather than their muscles well
the<00:01:56.250> problem<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.729> these<00:01:57.210> guys<00:01:57.420> get<00:01:57.689> further

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
the problem is these guys get further

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.450 
the problem is these guys get further
and<00:01:58.110> further<00:01:58.229> away<00:01:58.500> from<00:01:58.649> actually<00:01:59.219> building

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
and further away from actually building

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.880 
and further away from actually building
any<00:01:59.640> kind<00:01:59.880> of<00:01:59.909> muscle<00:02:00.149> because<00:02:01.020> any<00:02:01.500> time<00:02:01.770> they

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
any kind of muscle because any time they

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.139 
any kind of muscle because any time they
want<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.070> lower<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.460> weights<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.909> actually

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
want to lower the weights to actually

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.940 
want to lower the weights to actually
train<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.689> actually<00:02:03.899> put<00:02:04.049> on<00:02:04.140> size<00:02:04.380> it's<00:02:04.860> a

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
train to actually put on size it's a

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.310 
train to actually put on size it's a
huge<00:02:05.189> shot<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.399> their<00:02:05.640> ego<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.869> thing<00:02:07.079> is

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
huge shot to their ego so the thing is

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.260 
huge shot to their ego so the thing is
is<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.560> start<00:02:07.890> off<00:02:07.979> now<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.789> if<00:02:08.940> your<00:02:09.030> goal<00:02:09.179> is

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
is to start off now and if your goal is

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.840 
is to start off now and if your goal is
to<00:02:09.300> pack<00:02:09.569> on<00:02:09.750> size

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
to pack on size

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.460 
to pack on size
take<00:02:10.970> a<00:02:11.000> step<00:02:11.240> back<00:02:11.450> and<00:02:11.810> watch<00:02:12.110> out<00:02:12.260> for<00:02:12.290> any

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
take a step back and watch out for any

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.530 
take a step back and watch out for any
of<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.590> key<00:02:12.800> indicators<00:02:13.150> they're<00:02:14.150> gonna<00:02:14.300> show

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
of the key indicators they're gonna show

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.150 
of the key indicators they're gonna show
that<00:02:14.750> you're<00:02:14.870> training<00:02:15.110> with<00:02:15.170> melania<00:02:15.830> rather

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
that you're training with melania rather

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.580 
that you're training with melania rather
than<00:02:16.370> using<00:02:16.550> your<00:02:16.700> muscles<00:02:17.230> one<00:02:18.230> of<00:02:18.320> the<00:02:18.410> key

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
than using your muscles one of the key

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.980 
than using your muscles one of the key
terms<00:02:18.950> that<00:02:19.190> we<00:02:19.310> have<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:19.760> talk<00:02:20.390> about<00:02:20.450> here<00:02:20.900> is

terms that we have to talk about here is

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.890 
terms that we have to talk about here is
time<00:02:21.350> under<00:02:21.830> tension<00:02:21.940> okay<00:02:22.940> meaning<00:02:23.300> that<00:02:23.450> the

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
time under tension okay meaning that the

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.560 
time under tension okay meaning that the
actual<00:02:24.440> amount<00:02:24.680> of<00:02:24.860> tension<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:25.550> load<00:02:25.910> that's

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
actual amount of tension and load that's

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.480 
actual amount of tension and load that's
put<00:02:26.780> on<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:26.930> muscle<00:02:27.410> is<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.560> most<00:02:27.890> important

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
put on the muscle is the most important

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.390 
put on the muscle is the most important
thing<00:02:28.760> for<00:02:29.240> actual<00:02:29.780> muscle<00:02:30.200> size<00:02:30.470> if<00:02:30.860> you<00:02:31.220> had

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
thing for actual muscle size if you had

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.120 
thing for actual muscle size if you had
to<00:02:31.520> choose<00:02:31.790> one<00:02:32.360> particular<00:02:32.630> factor<00:02:33.410> not<00:02:33.860> the

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
to choose one particular factor not the

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.040 
to choose one particular factor not the
amount<00:02:34.400> of<00:02:34.580> weight<00:02:34.850> that<00:02:35.120> you're<00:02:35.360> moving<00:02:35.720> the

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
amount of weight that you're moving the

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.930 
amount of weight that you're moving the
fact<00:02:36.320> is<00:02:36.590> is<00:02:36.770> that<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:37.040> can<00:02:37.280> make<00:02:37.460> a<00:02:37.670> lighter

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
fact is is that you can make a lighter

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.360 
fact is is that you can make a lighter
weight<00:02:38.240> for<00:02:38.630> instance<00:02:38.990> a<00:02:39.140> thirty<00:02:39.770> five<00:02:40.010> pound

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
weight for instance a thirty five pound

dumbbell<00:02:40.820> feel<00:02:41.330> a<00:02:41.360> lot<00:02:41.630> heavier<00:02:42.080> to<00:02:42.650> your

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
dumbbell feel a lot heavier to your

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.730 
dumbbell feel a lot heavier to your
muscle<00:02:43.250> then<00:02:43.820> a<00:02:44.120> fifty<00:02:44.840> pound<00:02:45.020> dumbbell<00:02:45.560> if

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
muscle then a fifty pound dumbbell if

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.350 
muscle then a fifty pound dumbbell if
you're<00:02:46.130> just<00:02:46.310> swinging<00:02:46.610> the<00:02:46.850> fifty<00:02:47.150> pound

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
you're just swinging the fifty pound

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.840 
you're just swinging the fifty pound
dumbbell<00:02:47.780> your<00:02:48.410> muscle<00:02:48.800> doesn't<00:02:49.100> know<00:02:49.280> the

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
dumbbell your muscle doesn't know the

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.310 
dumbbell your muscle doesn't know the
number<00:02:50.180> that's<00:02:50.330> on<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.630> dumbbell<00:02:50.990> your

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
number that's on the dumbbell your

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.560 
number that's on the dumbbell your
muscle<00:02:51.680> only<00:02:52.070> knows<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.760> stress<00:02:53.150> that<00:02:53.180> it's

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
muscle only knows the stress that it's

growth okay just as Cal said you want to

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.870 
growth okay just as Cal said you want to
make<00:03:06.170> sure<00:03:06.410> that<00:03:06.620> your<00:03:06.800> first<00:03:07.070> indication<00:03:07.580> is

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
make sure that your first indication is

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.520 
make sure that your first indication is
that<00:03:08.060> you're<00:03:08.300> engaging<00:03:08.630> the<00:03:08.870> muscle<00:03:09.170> first<00:03:09.380> to

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
that you're engaging the muscle first to

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.320 
that you're engaging the muscle first to
make<00:03:09.620> sure<00:03:09.680> it's<00:03:09.770> firing<00:03:10.160> properly<00:03:10.520> and<00:03:10.910> the

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
make sure it's firing properly and the

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.630 
make sure it's firing properly and the
main<00:03:11.840> focus<00:03:12.320> is<00:03:12.470> all<00:03:12.590> on<00:03:12.620> that<00:03:12.980> muscle<00:03:13.190> so<00:03:13.580> in

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
main focus is all on that muscle so in

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.370
