only sort of one part of the screen

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.970 
only sort of one part of the screen
doesn't<00:00:42.030> work<00:00:42.210> but<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.230> that's<00:00:43.410> probably<00:00:43.710> due

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
doesn't work but so that's probably due

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.500 
doesn't work but so that's probably due
to<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.160> damage<00:00:44.460> Vanessa<00:00:45.090> sustained

to the damage Vanessa sustained

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.029 
to the damage Vanessa sustained
obviously<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.020> impact<00:00:46.350> has<00:00:46.559> happened<00:00:46.890> right

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
obviously the impact has happened right

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.700 
obviously the impact has happened right
at<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.280> bottom<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:48.110> so<00:00:49.110> what<00:00:49.469> yeah<00:00:49.680> that's

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
at the bottom and so what yeah that's

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.619 
at the bottom and so what yeah that's
what<00:00:50.039> led<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.610> but<00:00:50.940> next<00:00:51.239> we're<00:00:51.480> going<00:00:51.570> to

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629
