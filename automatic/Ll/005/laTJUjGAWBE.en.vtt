a<00:00:13.530> little<00:00:13.769> smaller<00:00:14.099> section<00:00:14.700> instead<00:00:14.969> of<00:00:15.089> the

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
a little smaller section instead of the

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.540 
a little smaller section instead of the
whole<00:00:15.299> head<00:00:15.770> I'm<00:00:16.770> trying<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.130> grow<00:00:17.279> them<00:00:17.460> out

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
whole head I'm trying to grow them out

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.519 
whole head I'm trying to grow them out
actually<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.180> have<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.480> problem<00:00:18.779> there's<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.170> cowl

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
actually I have a problem there's a cowl

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.439 
actually I have a problem there's a cowl
across<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.220> street<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:20.850> sucker<00:00:21.119> keeps

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
across the street and that sucker keeps

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.150 
across the street and that sucker keeps
coming<00:00:21.750> over<00:00:21.930> here<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.320> just<00:00:22.500> look<00:00:22.949> at<00:00:23.070> my

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
coming over here and just look at my

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.240 
coming over here and just look at my
hair<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.699> so<00:00:24.689> I'm<00:00:24.779> thinking<00:00:25.170> maybe<00:00:25.320> if<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:26.099> let

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.910 
hair and so I'm thinking maybe if I let
my<00:00:26.369> hair<00:00:26.580> my<00:00:27.090> bangs<00:00:27.330> grow<00:00:27.900> out<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.500> will<00:00:28.740> get

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.600 
rid of the cow leg that I've got so the
only<00:00:33.390> problem<00:00:33.899> with<00:00:34.050> all<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.559> though<00:00:34.860> is<00:00:35.309> as

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
only problem with all that though is as

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.160 
only problem with all that though is as
you<00:00:36.149> know<00:00:36.180> if<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.570> try<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.840> grow<00:00:37.020> out<00:00:37.140> your

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
you know if you try to grow out your

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.959 
you know if you try to grow out your
bangs<00:00:37.440> like<00:00:37.950> me<00:00:38.160> or<00:00:38.460> if<00:00:38.610> you're<00:00:38.730> trying<00:00:38.879> to

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
bangs like me or if you're trying to

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.310 
bangs like me or if you're trying to
grow<00:00:39.120> your<00:00:39.270> hair<00:00:39.300> out<00:00:39.480> maybe<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:40.020> cut<00:00:40.230> it

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
grow your hair out maybe you cut it

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.319 
grow your hair out maybe you cut it
short<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.920> it's<00:00:41.010> just<00:00:41.219> trying<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.030> grow<00:00:42.149> out

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
short and it's just trying to grow out

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.540 
short and it's just trying to grow out
again<00:00:42.440> or<00:00:43.440> maybe<00:00:43.829> you're<00:00:44.010> trying<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.340> let<00:00:44.430> your

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
again or maybe you're trying to let your

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.950 
again or maybe you're trying to let your
nose<00:00:44.700> hairs<00:00:44.969> grow<00:00:45.180> out<00:00:45.329> I'm<00:00:45.480> not<00:00:45.660> really<00:00:45.809> sure

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
nose hairs grow out I'm not really sure

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.319 
nose hairs grow out I'm not really sure
why<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.620> would<00:00:46.800> do<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.070> but<00:00:47.550> it's<00:00:47.820> possible

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
why you would do that but it's possible

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.990 
why you would do that but it's possible
so<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.920> know<00:00:50.039> sometimes<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.579> just<00:00:50.700> gets<00:00:50.760> to

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
so you know sometimes it just gets to

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.580 
so you know sometimes it just gets to
that<00:00:51.120> awkward<00:00:51.600> stage<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.170> you're<00:00:52.260> not<00:00:52.379> really

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
that awkward stage and you're not really

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.380 
that awkward stage and you're not really
sure<00:00:52.920> what<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.340> do<00:00:53.520> with<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.699> because<00:00:54.030> you

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
sure what to do with it because you

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.180 
sure what to do with it because you
don't<00:00:54.600> want<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.840> cut<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.230> because<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.800> you're

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
don't want to cut it because the you're

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.819 
don't want to cut it because the you're
trying<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.670> let<00:00:56.789> them<00:00:56.910> grow<00:00:57.120> out<00:00:57.649> but<00:00:58.649> at<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
trying to let them grow out but at the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.849 
trying to let them grow out but at the
same<00:00:59.129> time<00:00:59.480> they're<00:01:00.480> just<00:01:00.660> kind<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.109> there<00:01:01.530> and

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
same time they're just kind of there and

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.229 
same time they're just kind of there and
you<00:01:02.039> don't<00:01:02.250> really<00:01:02.399> know<00:01:02.640> what<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.940> do<00:01:03.090> with

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
you don't really know what to do with

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.620 
you don't really know what to do with
them<00:01:03.890> so<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:04.920> have<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.189> few<00:01:05.460> ideas<00:01:05.489> for<00:01:05.909> myself

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
the first thing I thought of was what i

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:45.780 
the first thing I thought of was what i
like<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.210> call<00:01:33.259> the<00:01:34.259> Biba<00:01:34.560> bank

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:53.050

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
really want that so the other idea I had

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.969 
really want that so the other idea I had
of<00:01:57.350> though<00:01:57.830> was<00:01:58.159> to<00:01:58.460> pull<00:01:59.299> out<00:01:59.450> my<00:01:59.810> bobby<00:02:00.560> pins

of though was to pull out my bobby pins

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.740 
of though was to pull out my bobby pins
because<00:02:01.280> I've<00:02:01.520> got<00:02:01.700> like<00:02:01.880> a<00:02:01.909> million<00:02:02.390> of<00:02:02.720> them

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.179 
because I've got like a million of them
seen<00:02:05.110> yeah<00:02:06.110> that's<00:02:06.409> not<00:02:06.560> really<00:02:06.770> a<00:02:06.799> million

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
seen yeah that's not really a million

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.850 
seen yeah that's not really a million
but<00:02:07.340> you<00:02:07.490> get<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:07.640> idea<00:02:08.350> so<00:02:09.350> I<00:02:09.380> thought<00:02:09.769> about

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
but you get the idea so I thought about

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.800 
but you get the idea so I thought about
pulling<00:02:10.130> off<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.369> bobby<00:02:10.550> pins<00:02:10.880> and<00:02:11.150> just<00:02:11.180> pin

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
pulling off the bobby pins and just pin

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.940 
pulling off the bobby pins and just pin
for<00:02:12.050> those<00:02:12.170> suckers<00:02:12.380> back<00:02:12.739> just<00:02:13.040> peel<00:02:13.640> it<00:02:13.670> back

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
for those suckers back just peel it back

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.710 
for those suckers back just peel it back

on my power broker hundred a runaway

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.130 
on my power broker hundred a runaway
does<00:02:18.140> it<00:02:18.350> doesn't<00:02:18.739> but<00:02:19.160> no<00:02:19.370> one<00:02:19.610> cares<00:02:19.880> my<00:02:20.150> papa

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.440 

the<00:02:24.140> 50<00:02:24.410> girl<00:02:24.890> gonna<00:02:25.340> run<00:02:25.580> away<00:02:25.700> unseen<00:02:26.299> it

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.570 
doesn't go but no one can is my papa
however<00:02:29.720> I<00:02:30.200> thought<00:02:30.709> that<00:02:31.040> might<00:02:31.250> make<00:02:31.549> you

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
however I thought that might make you

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:42.990 
however I thought that might make you
look<00:02:31.880> a<00:02:32.060> little<00:02:32.269> bit<00:02:32.510> like<00:02:32.690> a<00:02:32.890> triceratops<00:02:41.470> so

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
look a little bit like a triceratops so

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.750 
look a little bit like a triceratops so
maybe<00:02:44.000> not<00:02:44.239> such<00:02:44.480> a<00:02:44.540> good<00:02:44.720> idea

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
maybe not such a good idea

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.509 
maybe not such a good idea
now<00:02:46.569> the<00:02:46.650> inspiration<00:02:47.650> for<00:02:47.830> this<00:02:47.950> next<00:02:48.159> idea

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
now the inspiration for this next idea

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.670 
now the inspiration for this next idea
came<00:02:48.849> from<00:02:49.150> a<00:02:49.360> few<00:02:49.599> weeks<00:02:49.720> ago<00:02:49.959> when<00:02:50.200> I<00:02:50.260> decided

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
came from a few weeks ago when I decided

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.250 
came from a few weeks ago when I decided
I'd<00:02:50.890> be<00:02:51.040> rebellious<00:02:51.400> and<00:02:51.879> by<00:02:52.780> black

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
I'd be rebellious and by black

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.690 
I'd be rebellious and by black
fingernail<00:02:53.920> polish<00:02:54.159> what<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:56.430> little<00:02:57.430> scared

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
fingernail polish what a little scared

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.240 
fingernail polish what a little scared
to<00:02:57.819> do<00:02:57.970> it<00:02:58.000> but<00:02:58.329> I<00:02:58.390> did<00:02:58.599> so<00:02:58.930> black<00:02:59.799> fingernail

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
to do it but I did so black fingernail

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.160 
to do it but I did so black fingernail
polish<00:03:00.489> was<00:03:00.879> the<00:03:01.030> inspiration<00:03:01.360> for<00:03:01.689> this<00:03:01.930> next

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
polish was the inspiration for this next

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:11.710 
polish was the inspiration for this next
idea

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.870 

so<00:03:13.580> that's<00:03:14.580> another<00:03:14.850> idea<00:03:16.100> the<00:03:17.100> last<00:03:17.610> idea

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
so that's another idea the last idea

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.750 
so that's another idea the last idea
that<00:03:18.180> I<00:03:18.209> thought<00:03:18.480> of<00:03:18.540> was<00:03:19.020> I've<00:03:19.860> got<00:03:20.100> a<00:03:20.459> bunch

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.670 

unfortunately<00:04:01.870> sometimes<00:04:02.140> with<00:04:02.530> these

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
unfortunately sometimes with these

headbands<00:04:03.219> though<00:04:03.549> yeah<00:04:04.480> they<00:04:05.290> get<00:04:05.439> a<00:04:05.500> little

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
headbands though yeah they get a little

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.399 
headbands though yeah they get a little
tight<00:04:06.069> you<00:04:06.250> know<00:04:06.280> and<00:04:06.670> so<00:04:07.140> especially<00:04:08.140> around

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:08.409 
tight you know and so especially around

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:10.319 
tight you know and so especially around
your<00:04:08.680> head<00:04:08.829> if<00:04:08.950> you<00:04:09.010> got<00:04:09.159> a<00:04:09.189> big<00:04:09.370> big<00:04:09.909> old<00:04:10.090> turn

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
your head if you got a big big old turn

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.470 
your head if you got a big big old turn
head<00:04:10.629> and<00:04:11.099> kind<00:04:12.099> of<00:04:12.310> gives<00:04:13.090> you<00:04:13.180> a<00:04:13.269> headache

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.629 
head and kind of gives you a headache
after<00:04:13.900> wall<00:04:14.319> because<00:04:14.650> it's<00:04:14.799> squeezing<00:04:15.280> and

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:15.639 
after wall because it's squeezing and

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:18.140 
after wall because it's squeezing and
squeezing<00:04:15.879> it's<00:04:16.389> like<00:04:16.539> your<00:04:16.690> heads<00:04:16.989> in<00:04:17.169> a<00:04:17.289> vise

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
squeezing it's like your heads in a vise

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.740 
squeezing it's like your heads in a vise
so<00:04:19.150> maybe<00:04:19.359> that's<00:04:19.630> not<00:04:19.810> such<00:04:20.019> a<00:04:20.079> good<00:04:20.169> idea<00:04:21.750> so

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
so maybe that's not such a good idea so

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.779 
so maybe that's not such a good idea so
me<00:04:23.259> personally<00:04:23.470> however<00:04:24.160> none<00:04:24.580> of<00:04:24.699> those

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
me personally however none of those

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:26.610 
me personally however none of those
looks<00:04:25.180> so<00:04:25.479> what<00:04:25.570> ideas<00:04:26.169> weren't<00:04:26.410> really

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
looks so what ideas weren't really

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.100 
looks so what ideas weren't really
working<00:04:26.800> for<00:04:27.009> me<00:04:27.250> so<00:04:27.669> I<00:04:28.479> think<00:04:28.600> I'm<00:04:28.840> just<00:04:28.870> gonna

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
working for me so I think I'm just gonna

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.770 
working for me so I think I'm just gonna
let<00:04:29.440> them<00:04:29.650> just<00:04:30.310> let<00:04:30.490> him<00:04:30.550> stay<00:04:31.330> how<00:04:31.360> they<00:04:31.630> are

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
I mean it's gonna require a little hand

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.969 
I mean it's gonna require a little hand
action<00:04:33.310> every<00:04:33.789> once<00:04:34.000> in<00:04:34.180> a<00:04:34.210> while<00:04:34.360> you<00:04:34.389> know
