00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello friends I will talk to you about chiles de la 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.450
 welcome to million curiosities of the 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.010
 videogames chapter 29 and well how about 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.200
 if we start talking a little about 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.480
 pokemon specifically red pokemon 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.280
 fire and green leaf at a certain time the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.590
 game if you're playing a version 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.690
 pirated game either a rom or a 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.100
 pirate cartridge one of the sailors who 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.510
 they are inside the game will tell you 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.609
 that if you like the game you should 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.170
 buy it or if you do not die clays 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.240
 basically they threaten you with death 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.250
 have pirated the game although said 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.019
 that is not clear if this was added 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.090
 for the same nintendo or if it was put 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.590
 for those who asked for the game something like that 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.899
 as a warning that the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.340
 pirates there to give you a little 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.930
 incentive for people to buy 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.370
 game and the next curiosity the 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.050
 we find in the game devil the 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.940
 original for pc in the main menu 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.649
 of the game where I was to start the 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.480
 heading continue and all those things from 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.340
 options you can find a message 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.840
 hidden to reveal this message is 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.489
 necessary to take a screenshot 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.170
 of what is being seen at this moment 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.180
 from the menu and then pass it to some 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.070
 drawing or manipulation program 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.260
 photographic like for example the paint of 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.390
 windows to reveal the message should 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.670
 remember an area in the back 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.330
 of the fund in which there is a message that 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.460
 is 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.110
 with letters that are almost exactly the 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.640
 same color as the background but if one 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.740
 runs through all the color of the background 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.900
 they can see clearly and they are really 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.220
 two messages one of them apparently 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.070
 it's a kind of publicity for a 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.600
 game called guard 2 even if you keep a 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.640
 name so generic that the truth is not 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.560
 I would know to tell you that the game is that and 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.970
 another is a message apparently indicates 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.980
 that someone in blizzard is a fan of 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.050
 natalie portman a small university 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.810
 that we can find in alice madness 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.670
 returns is that in chapter 4 you can 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.230
 find hidden in the level a cube 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.970
 companion of the series of games of 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.700
 portal in the next curiosity we 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.020
 comes directly from the witcher 2 in 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.880
 the prologue part of the game is 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.590
 possible to divert you from your normal truck and 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.760
 go explore a little and by doing this 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.650
 you may find yourself with some 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.479
 lots of straw and inside these 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.310
 straw engines it is possible to find you 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.140
 with a familiar figure you can 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.970
 find altair of the game until it 's 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.530
 inscribe that you're lying with your face 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.240
 down and with a lot of blood to his 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.160
 side as well as if he had died for 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.050
 failing a jump efe also fits 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.760
 highlight that discovering this little one is 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.950
 direct will increase the ability to give 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.420
 stabbings in the back good and 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.910
 changing the subject completely once 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.800
 more because we are not going to give on pokemon 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.660
 the pokémon game is possible with a 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.820
 guy who says he does not like 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.350
 pokemon designs and then says 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.380
 that there should be a pokémon that is 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.670
 pink and with a flower pattern 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.290
 we advance in time to the fifth 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.270
 generation of pokemons and we can see 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.340
 that the creators put a pokémon 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.920
 that is inspired by those words the 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.660
 which is silent that also sketched with a 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.430
 flower pattern and the next 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.610
 curiosity we can find it in halo 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.980
 3 at the level kiko one station can be 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.110
 enter alone or hong kong you can 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.850
 find a pretty interesting strike 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.800
 you can get to a back 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.480
 or a map with a bridge in which 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.070
 you have to jump and by doing this you 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.990
 you will find a hologram of a type 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.490
 dancer who for some reason has 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.530
 flies flying around your body and 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.220
 he will also start playing a little music 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.220
 a little funky 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.980
 and our next curiosity is 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.150
 find in the magical game as his 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.920
 name indicates the characters 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.570
 of the game are magicians the 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.700
 which use magical powers to 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.050
 defend and fight and you can also 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.820
 use these magical powers to 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.500
 different things like for example if 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.540
 you need to cross a body of water 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.460
 you can freeze some ice spell and 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.140
 so you can cross over 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.240
 exactly using this technique is like 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.490
 you can reach an area that has a 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.980
 pretty interesting secret in a 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.660
 hidden path it is possible to meet you 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.130
 a kind of clearing in a forest where 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.990
 you will find a pedestal which 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.540
 has the sword inside the legend of 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.950
 zelda the master sword and not only 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.780
 I was there for decoration but 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.790
 You can also pick it up and use it as a 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.100
 weapon although they do not really call it the 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.900
 master sword but they say the sword 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.820
 of the teachers but the reference is 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.470
 obvious another interesting thing is that the 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.570
 sword design is the design that is 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.400
 used in the line of zelda ocarina of time 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.890
 but the place where the 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.540
 altar where it is nailed is more like 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.000
 who is in trade of zelda to 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.859
 link to the past and to finish we are going to 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.930
 see something of the game harvest moon more 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.019
 friends of mineral 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.780
 and title and this only works in the 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.940
 Japanese version of the game and consists of 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.990
 go watch the TV at the specific time of 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:32.460
 4 o'clock in the morning with 44 minutes and 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.710
 doing this will cause the screen 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.650
 start to get lots of characters 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.370
 and of numbers 4 everywhere 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.729
 apparently the message in Japanese 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.220
 simply says 444 again and again a 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:46.440
 and again but the interesting thing is that in 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.060
 Japanese the number 4 is the number that is 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.070
 associated with death as the 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.590
 pronunciation of the number 4 and the word 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.300
 death are very similar and this was 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.860
 put there probably to put 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.660
 paranoid to all players 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.729
 Japanese that were playing that 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.320
 time and although I mentioned this 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.330
 can only be passed in the version 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.160
 Japanese and while everything is true there 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.320
 something curious that happens in the version no 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.599
 American because this message 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.190
 it only makes sense in Japanese the 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:13.530
 that they adapted the version for 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.870
 American decided to remove this 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.520
 message what they did was remove the 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.289
 code that made the 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.240
 message on screen but they did not remove 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:23.070
 the code that made this happen in 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.990
 first place therefore if you do it in 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.860
 the american version will start to come out 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.689
 a text box 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.939
 which does not have any written text of 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:31.860
 her again and again and this was all for 

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:33.210
 this time if you liked the video by 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.409
 please leave a thumbs up and if 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.789
 they want to see more of this can 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:38.219
 subscribe because there's a lot more to 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:40.199
 where did this come from I'm also on twitter 

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:42.060
 and the new facebook page which 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:43.590
 you can find below in the description 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.750
 of the video if they want to like it and 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.310
 also if any curiosity that you 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.050
 would like to see in my crucial the 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.490
 video games please send sail for a 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.650
 private message if the power of the 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.370
 comments are not going to see it here so 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.370
 See you bye 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:02.430
 that for some reason he has flies in his 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:05.150
 body in addition for some reason 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.150
 start flying
