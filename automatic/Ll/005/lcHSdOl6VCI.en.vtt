that<00:01:06.950> as<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.340> without<00:01:09.060> reducing<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.229> size

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
that as it is without reducing the size

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.980 
that as it is without reducing the size
of<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:11.280> foot<00:01:11.490> that's<00:01:12.270> that's<00:01:12.600> my<00:01:12.750> problem

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
of the foot that's that's my problem

because<00:01:13.580> when<00:01:14.580> we<00:01:14.670> looked<00:01:14.850> at<00:01:14.909> goblets

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
because when we looked at goblets

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.010 
because when we looked at goblets
anywhere<00:01:15.689> else

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
anywhere else

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.200 
anywhere else
it<00:01:16.259> basically<00:01:16.710> said<00:01:17.130> all<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.670> goblets<00:01:18.060> had

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
it basically said all the goblets had

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.890 
it basically said all the goblets had
the<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.930> BS<00:01:19.170> was<00:01:19.380> either<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:21.060> same<00:01:21.299> size<00:01:21.570> as

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
the the BS was either the same size as

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.320 
the the BS was either the same size as
the<00:01:22.350> diameter<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.890> ball<00:01:23.040> or<00:01:23.330> slightly

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
the diameter of the ball or slightly

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.530 
the diameter of the ball or slightly
less<00:01:24.720> but<00:01:25.549> I've<00:01:26.549> discovered<00:01:26.939> something<00:01:27.299> else

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
less but I've discovered something else

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.870 
less but I've discovered something else
and<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.020> travels<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.619> realized<00:01:29.040> why<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.460> looked

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
and the travels I realized why it looked

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.880

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
right right way up view but that's what

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:17.710 
right right way up view but that's what
we're<00:02:16.760> used<00:02:16.940> to<00:02:17.030> looking<00:02:17.150> at<00:02:17.420> as<00:02:17.510> wood

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
we're used to looking at as wood

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.949 
we're used to looking at as wood
Turner's<00:02:18.340> so<00:02:19.340> there's<00:02:19.520> my<00:02:19.640> problem<00:02:20.060> this<00:02:20.420> here

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
Turner's so there's my problem this here

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.710 
Turner's so there's my problem this here
is<00:02:21.440> bigger<00:02:21.800> than<00:02:22.190> this<00:02:22.370> here<00:02:22.730> I<00:02:22.910> don't<00:02:23.450> want<00:02:23.630> to

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
is bigger than this here I don't want to

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.020 
is bigger than this here I don't want to
know<00:02:23.810> it<00:02:24.050> are<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.410> proportions<00:02:24.739> okay<00:02:25.310> or<00:02:25.730> do<00:02:25.970> I

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
know it are the proportions okay or do I

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.670 
know it are the proportions okay or do I
need<00:02:26.120> to<00:02:26.330> reduce<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:26.870> size<00:02:27.080> if<00:02:27.290> orders

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
need to reduce the size if orders

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.190 
need to reduce the size if orders
weren't<00:02:28.040> gonna<00:02:28.220> cut<00:02:28.489> it<00:02:28.610> off<00:02:28.700> here<00:02:29.090> and<00:02:30.050> the

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
weren't gonna cut it off here and the

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.780 
weren't gonna cut it off here and the
reason<00:02:30.350> it<00:02:30.560> ended<00:02:30.650> up<00:02:30.800> that<00:02:30.860> size<00:02:31.250> was<00:02:31.459> because

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
reason it ended up that size was because

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.479 
reason it ended up that size was because
as<00:02:32.060> I<00:02:32.209> was<00:02:32.360> cutting<00:02:32.750> here<00:02:33.260> and<00:02:33.440> looking<00:02:34.190> up<00:02:34.370> at

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
as I was cutting here and looking up at

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:35.110 
as I was cutting here and looking up at
this<00:02:34.610> end

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
this end

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.140 
this end
the<00:02:35.450> proportions<00:02:36.140> seemed<00:02:36.470> right<00:02:36.770> and<00:02:37.730> Steve

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
the proportions seemed right and Steve

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.729 
the proportions seemed right and Steve
does<00:02:38.300> seem<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.569> match<00:02:38.750> nicely<00:02:39.170> and<00:02:39.380> it's<00:02:39.500> going

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
does seem to match nicely and it's going

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.650 
does seem to match nicely and it's going
to<00:02:39.800> measure<00:02:39.950> it<00:02:40.160> or<00:02:40.280> realized<00:02:40.640> that<00:02:41.480> it<00:02:41.570> was

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
to measure it or realized that it was

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.780 
to measure it or realized that it was
too<00:02:41.870> big<00:02:42.050> well<00:02:42.739> it<00:02:42.890> may<00:02:43.070> be<00:02:43.100> too<00:02:43.250> big<00:02:43.519> I<00:02:43.580> don't

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
too big well it may be too big I don't

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.880 
too big well it may be too big I don't

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
very well designed and there's a little

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.640 
very well designed and there's a little
plate<00:04:46.940> here<00:04:46.970> that<00:04:47.450> you<00:04:47.600> use<00:04:47.840> a<00:04:47.870> spanner<00:04:48.230> on<00:04:48.470> and

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
plate here that you use a spanner on and

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.530 
plate here that you use a spanner on and
tighten<00:04:48.860> the<00:04:49.100> chalk<00:04:49.340> up<00:04:49.490> onto<00:04:49.850> this<00:04:49.970> so

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
tighten the chalk up onto this so

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.570 
tighten the chalk up onto this so
there's<00:04:50.690> no<00:04:50.780> chance<00:04:50.960> of<00:04:51.140> movement<00:04:51.530> and<00:04:51.740> then<00:04:52.310> I

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
there's no chance of movement and then I

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.980 
there's no chance of movement and then I
switch<00:04:53.540> sometimes<00:04:53.720> again<00:04:54.790> and<00:04:55.790> then<00:04:56.600> what<00:04:56.960> I

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990
