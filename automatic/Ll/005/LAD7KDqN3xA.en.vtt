understand how you're going to tackle
this<00:01:14.850> problem<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.659> solve<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:16.650> the

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
this problem and solve it in the

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.440 
this problem and solve it in the
necessary<00:01:17.220> steps<00:01:17.820> required<00:01:18.830> so<00:01:20.270> what<00:01:21.270> we're

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
necessary steps required so what we're

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.539 
necessary steps required so what we're
going<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.720> do<00:01:21.960> today<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.530> we<00:01:22.770> are<00:01:22.799> going<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.310> do

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
going to do today is we are going to do

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.679 
going to do today is we are going to do
just<00:01:24.170> four<00:01:25.170> problems<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.790> set<00:01:27.450> up<00:01:27.479> these

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
just four problems and I set up these

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.080 
just four problems and I set up these
four<00:01:27.960> problems<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.130> could<00:01:29.340> see<00:01:32.090> how

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
four problems so that you could see how

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.649 
four problems so that you could see how
you<00:01:33.119> need<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.479> read<00:01:34.009> formulas<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.340> data<00:01:35.759> to

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
you need to read formulas and data to

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.679 
you need to read formulas and data to
come<00:01:37.409> up<00:01:37.560> with<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.860> right<00:01:38.009> answer<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.689> so

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
come up with the right answer and so

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.120 
come up with the right answer and so
what<00:01:39.900> we're<00:01:40.049> gonna<00:01:40.140> cover<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.770> we're<00:01:40.979> gonna

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
what we're gonna cover is we're gonna

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.910 
what we're gonna cover is we're gonna
cover<00:01:41.430> DAF<00:01:41.909> loadings<00:01:42.540> which<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.259> dissolved

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
cover DAF loadings which is a dissolved

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.399 
cover DAF loadings which is a dissolved
air<00:01:44.100> flotation<00:01:44.130> unit<00:01:45.119> we<00:01:45.840> covered<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.229> in

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
air flotation unit we covered this in

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.130 
air flotation unit we covered this in
another<00:01:46.680> one<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:46.979> my<00:01:47.189> videos<00:01:47.600> you'll<00:01:48.600> see<00:01:48.689> that

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
another one of my videos you'll see that

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.359 
another one of my videos you'll see that
this<00:01:49.290> one's<00:01:49.560> gonna<00:01:49.710> be<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.950> little<00:01:50.009> bit

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
this one's gonna be a little bit

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.730 
this one's gonna be a little bit
different<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.020> you'll<00:01:52.020> see<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.350> in<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.530> bit

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
different and you'll see that in a bit

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.300 
different and you'll see that in a bit
we're<00:01:53.670> going<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.850> do<00:01:54.000> BTU<00:01:54.600> gas<00:01:54.899> production<00:01:55.310> BTU

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
we're going to do BTU gas production BTU

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.399 
we're going to do BTU gas production BTU
is<00:01:56.460> British<00:01:56.820> thermal<00:01:57.180> unit<00:01:57.719> it's<00:01:58.229> a

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
is British thermal unit it's a

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.690 
is British thermal unit it's a
measurement<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:58.950> heat<00:02:01.100> heat<00:02:02.100> generated<00:02:02.670> by

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
measurement of heat heat generated by

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.160 
measurement of heat heat generated by
gas<00:02:03.090> in<00:02:03.540> an<00:02:04.259> anaerobic<00:02:04.680> digester<00:02:05.810> and<00:02:06.810> then

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
gas in an anaerobic digester and then

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.960 
gas in an anaerobic digester and then
the<00:02:07.439> third<00:02:07.799> problem<00:02:08.069> we<00:02:08.280> were<00:02:08.369> going<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.640> do<00:02:08.789> is

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
the third problem we were going to do is

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.809 
the third problem we were going to do is
an<00:02:09.090> oxygen<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:10.020> water<00:02:10.319> transfer<00:02:11.160> efficiency

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
an oxygen to water transfer efficiency

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.430 
an oxygen to water transfer efficiency
which<00:02:12.690> would<00:02:12.930> be

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
which would be

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.360 
which would be
how<00:02:14.010> efficient<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.820> narrator<00:02:16.370> whether

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
how efficient a narrator whether

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.210 
how efficient a narrator whether
mechanical<00:02:17.970> or<00:02:18.120> diffused<00:02:19.340> is<00:02:21.200> efficiently

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
mechanical or diffused is efficiently

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.460 
mechanical or diffused is efficiently
putting<00:02:23.220> oxygen<00:02:23.730> into<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.060> water<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.540> then

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
putting oxygen into the water and then

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.380 
putting oxygen into the water and then
the<00:02:25.920> fourth<00:02:26.370> problem<00:02:26.610> we<00:02:26.820> will<00:02:26.910> be<00:02:26.970> doing<00:02:27.180> is

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
the fourth problem we will be doing is

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.840 
the fourth problem we will be doing is
advanced<00:02:27.900> chemical<00:02:28.380> dosing<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.430> costs

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
advanced chemical dosing and the costs

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.070 
advanced chemical dosing and the costs
associated<00:02:30.210> with<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:31.460> and<00:02:32.460> then<00:02:32.670> if<00:02:33.000> any<00:02:33.930> of

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
associated with that and then if any of

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.630 
associated with that and then if any of
you<00:02:34.200> guys<00:02:34.350> have<00:02:34.560> more<00:02:34.860> specific<00:02:35.610> questions

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
you guys have more specific questions

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.620 
you guys have more specific questions
