nails<00:00:50.579> but<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.850> has<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.210> be<00:00:51.239> steel<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.899> they

nails but it has to be steel and they

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.020 
nails but it has to be steel and they
need<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.530> piece<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.829> string<00:00:52.949> or<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.789> piece<00:00:54.000> of

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
need a piece of string or a piece of

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.810 
need a piece of string or a piece of
floss<00:00:54.800> and<00:00:55.800> that's<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.969> here<00:00:57.120> we<00:00:57.210> go<00:00:58.820> for

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
floss and that's it so here we go for

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.000 
floss and that's it so here we go for
all<00:00:59.910> intents<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.359> purposes<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:01.170> pen<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.800> the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
all intents and purposes this pen is the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.130 
all intents and purposes this pen is the
nail<00:01:02.270> and<00:01:03.270> basically<00:01:03.600> you're<00:01:03.809> just<00:01:03.960> going<00:01:04.110> to

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
nail and basically you're just going to

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.050 
nail and basically you're just going to
hang<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.500> it's<00:01:05.400> going<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.610> be<00:01:05.670> like<00:01:05.820> this

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
hang it it's going to be like this

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.899 
hang it it's going to be like this
obviously<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.780> nail<00:01:06.960> doesn't<00:01:07.290> weigh<00:01:07.409> as<00:01:07.560> much

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
obviously the nail doesn't weigh as much

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.940 
obviously the nail doesn't weigh as much
but<00:01:08.909> here's<00:01:09.479> what's<00:01:09.689> going<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.840> happen<00:01:09.950> it's

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
but here's what's going to happen it's

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.170 
but here's what's going to happen it's
going<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.100> dangle<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.580> as<00:01:11.700> close<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.150> as

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
going to dangle it as close to you as

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.740 
going to dangle it as close to you as
possible

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
possible

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.510 
possible
now<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.350> might<00:01:13.650> have<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.920> just<00:01:14.189> kind<00:01:14.400> of

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
now you might have to just kind of

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.820 
now you might have to just kind of
slowly<00:01:14.880> want<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.299> stay<00:01:15.540> still<00:01:15.869> move<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.439> little

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
slowly want to stay still move a little

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.580 
slowly want to stay still move a little
bit<00:01:16.950> around<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.340> head<00:01:17.549> but<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.939> will<00:01:18.150> catch

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
bit around the head but it will catch

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.810 
bit around the head but it will catch
and<00:01:19.590> once<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.920> catches<00:01:20.130> it's<00:01:20.430> going<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.610> start

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
and once it catches it's going to start

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.670 
and once it catches it's going to start
moving<00:01:20.930> it's<00:01:21.930> going<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.110> start<00:01:22.229> moving<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.530> one

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
moving it's going to start moving to one

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.960 
moving it's going to start moving to one
or<00:01:22.799> two<00:01:22.830> directions<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.520> have<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.729> brain

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
or two directions you have the brain

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.120 
or two directions you have the brain
hemisphere<00:01:24.630> down<00:01:25.170> here<00:01:25.500> males<00:01:25.799> are<00:01:25.920> going<00:01:26.070> to

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
hemisphere down here males are going to

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.999

move<00:01:26.280> straight<00:01:26.640> up<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.060> down<00:01:27.770> okay<00:01:28.770> it

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
move straight up and down okay it

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.109 
move straight up and down okay it
doesn't<00:01:29.159> matter<00:01:29.310> which<00:01:29.549> way<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.850> nail<00:01:30.000> is

in<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.280> circular<00:01:41.579> motion<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:43.070> that's<00:01:44.070> it

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
in a circular motion and that's it

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.609 
in a circular motion and that's it
and<00:01:44.820> you'll<00:01:44.970> notice<00:01:45.180> males<00:01:46.399> females<00:01:48.500> and<00:01:49.500> it's

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
and you'll notice males females and it's

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.539 
and you'll notice males females and it's
as<00:01:49.740> simple<00:01:49.890> as<00:01:50.130> that

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
as simple as that

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.980 
as simple as that
so<00:01:51.000> you're<00:01:51.210> going<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.420> see<00:01:51.570> an<00:01:51.659> actual

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
so you're going to see an actual

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.580 
so you're going to see an actual
demonstration<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:53.460> real<00:01:54.270> birds<00:01:54.540> on<00:01:55.079> what<00:01:55.470> this

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
demonstration on real birds on what this

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.750 
demonstration on real birds on what this
is<00:01:55.799> going<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.399> look<00:01:56.579> like

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.750 

now<00:02:00.690> you<00:02:00.750> notice<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:02.040> just<00:02:02.220> put<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.550> nail

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
now you notice you just put the nail

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.870 
now you notice you just put the nail
just<00:02:03.470> right<00:02:04.470> there<00:02:04.650> and<00:02:04.770> hold<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.040> steady<00:02:05.310> and

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
just right there and hold it steady and

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.610 
just right there and hold it steady and
eventually<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.510> will<00:02:06.630> start<00:02:06.810> moving<00:02:07.350> and

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
eventually it will start moving and

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:15.380 
eventually it will start moving and
obviously<00:02:13.340> so<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.520> starts<00:02:14.850> now<00:02:14.970> moving<00:02:15.210> in

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
obviously so it starts now moving in

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:22.730 
obviously so it starts now moving in
circle<00:02:16.580> almost<00:02:17.580> oblong<00:02:18.270> that's<00:02:18.960> a<00:02:19.140> female<00:02:21.740> now

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
circle almost oblong that's a female now

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.350 
circle almost oblong that's a female now
you'll<00:02:22.920> notice<00:02:23.100> directly<00:02:24.000> towards<00:02:24.270> the

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
you'll notice directly towards the

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.670 
you'll notice directly towards the
camera<00:02:24.690> you'll<00:02:24.840> see<00:02:25.020> it's<00:02:25.140> going<00:02:25.320> right<00:02:25.560> up

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
camera you'll see it's going right up

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.920 
camera you'll see it's going right up
and<00:02:25.800> down<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.070> atmosphere<00:02:28.130> here's<00:02:29.130> your<00:02:29.310> boy

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
or watch their breeding practices that's

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.900 
or watch their breeding practices that's
how<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.090> tell<00:02:36.390> whether<00:02:37.200> or<00:02:37.320> not<00:02:37.580> you<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:38.610> male
