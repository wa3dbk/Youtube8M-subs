happy he's got a little bit of weight to

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.140 
happy he's got a little bit of weight to
it<00:02:50.660> but<00:02:50.900> that's<00:02:51.080> what<00:02:51.230> you<00:02:51.350> expect<00:02:51.440> on<00:02:52.190> the

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
it but that's what you expect on the

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.140 
it but that's what you expect on the

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
right side it's got the headphone mic

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.950 
right side it's got the headphone mic
jack<00:02:56.510> it's<00:02:56.900> good<00:02:57.050> at<00:02:57.170> a<00:02:57.200> USB<00:02:57.920> port<00:02:58.690> CD<00:02:59.690> drive

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
jack it's good at a USB port CD drive

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.560 
jack it's good at a USB port CD drive
and<00:03:00.740> on<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.340> left<00:03:01.640> side<00:03:02.470> we<00:03:03.470> have<00:03:03.500> a<00:03:04.450> jack<00:03:05.450> for

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
and on the left side we have a jack for

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.630 
and on the left side we have a jack for
like<00:03:05.690> a<00:03:05.750> monitor<00:03:06.170> Ethernet<00:03:07.100> cable<00:03:07.490> oh<00:03:09.640> that's

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
like a monitor Ethernet cable oh that's

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.450 
like a monitor Ethernet cable oh that's
actually<00:03:10.790> really<00:03:12.130> exciting<00:03:13.130> I<00:03:13.250> didn't<00:03:13.400> think

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
actually really exciting I didn't think

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.890 
actually really exciting I didn't think
it<00:03:13.610> I<00:03:13.670> teach<00:03:13.820> to<00:03:13.970> you<00:03:14.060> my<00:03:14.180> own<00:03:14.360> but<00:03:14.570> I<00:03:14.630> guess<00:03:14.750> it

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
it I teach to you my own but I guess it

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:21.190 
it I teach to you my own but I guess it
does<00:03:15.080> into<00:03:16.030> USB<00:03:17.320> 3.0<00:03:18.760> Jack's<00:03:19.760> so<00:03:20.090> it's<00:03:20.930> got<00:03:21.050> two

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
does into USB 3.0 Jack's so it's got two

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.340 
does into USB 3.0 Jack's so it's got two
speakers<00:03:22.030> looks<00:03:23.030> really<00:03:23.360> nice<00:03:23.540> look<00:03:24.230> up

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350

all right now we're gonna start it up
and<00:03:46.640> see<00:03:46.730> how<00:03:46.760> much<00:03:46.909> battery<00:03:47.150> it<00:03:47.420> came<00:03:47.599> with<00:03:47.840> oh

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.119 

I<00:03:52.459> really<00:03:53.420> excited<00:03:53.930> about<00:03:54.019> that<00:03:54.170> it<00:03:54.709> also<00:03:54.859> has

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:55.129 
I really excited about that it also has

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:56.289 
I really excited about that it also has
all<00:03:55.400> I<00:03:55.430> didn't<00:03:55.640> even<00:03:55.730> mention<00:03:55.939> it<00:03:56.120> has<00:03:56.239> a

that it's what I'm talking about so

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.629 
that it's what I'm talking about so
we've<00:04:07.459> finished<00:04:07.639> the<00:04:07.970> setup<00:04:08.209> process<00:04:09.489> this<00:04:10.489> is

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:10.639 
we've finished the setup process this is

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:13.330 
we've finished the setup process this is
Windows<00:04:11.000> 8<00:04:11.409> this<00:04:12.409> is<00:04:12.530> my<00:04:12.650> first<00:04:12.920> time<00:04:13.099> really

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
Windows 8 this is my first time really

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.910 
Windows 8 this is my first time really
using<00:04:13.730> Windows<00:04:14.000> 8<00:04:14.180> this<00:04:14.780> laptop<00:04:15.109> is<00:04:15.500> not<00:04:15.709> a

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
using Windows 8 this laptop is not a

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.670 
using Windows 8 this laptop is not a
touchscreen<00:04:16.370> laptop<00:04:16.549> I<00:04:17.380> don't<00:04:18.380> really<00:04:18.530> have

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
touchscreen laptop I don't really have

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.589 
touchscreen laptop I don't really have
problem<00:04:19.009> with<00:04:19.039> that<00:04:19.310> probably<00:04:20.209> wouldn't<00:04:20.570> use

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:20.599 
problem with that probably wouldn't use

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:23.290 
problem with that probably wouldn't use
a<00:04:20.720> touchscreen<00:04:21.049> that<00:04:21.440> much<00:04:21.910> well<00:04:22.910> I<00:04:22.970> guess<00:04:23.150> I

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
a touchscreen that much well I guess I

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.999 
a touchscreen that much well I guess I
would<00:04:23.360> but<00:04:23.889> you<00:04:24.889> know<00:04:24.919> said<00:04:25.250> oh<00:04:25.280> what's<00:04:25.789> that

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:27.009 
would but you know said oh what's that

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:29.499 
would but you know said oh what's that
no<00:04:28.009> I<00:04:28.340> don't<00:04:28.880> know<00:04:28.940> I<00:04:29.090> don't<00:04:29.240> know<00:04:29.300> anything

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:29.509 
no I don't know I don't know anything

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:31.210 
no I don't know I don't know anything
about<00:04:29.690> Windows<00:04:29.990> 8<00:04:30.110> so<00:04:30.800> this<00:04:30.889> will<00:04:31.070> be<00:04:31.190> a

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
about Windows 8 so this will be a

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.460 
about Windows 8 so this will be a
learning<00:04:31.580> experience<00:04:31.669> I<00:04:32.419> guess<00:04:33.080> so<00:04:33.289> I<00:04:33.320> guess

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
learning experience I guess so I guess

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.999 
learning experience I guess so I guess
this<00:04:33.680> is<00:04:33.800> the<00:04:33.889> desktop<00:04:34.190> down<00:04:35.180> here<00:04:35.479> yep<00:04:36.009> and

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:37.009 
this is the desktop down here yep and

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:38.650 
this is the desktop down here yep and
here<00:04:37.310> it<00:04:37.430> is

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
here it is

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.260 
here it is
ooh<00:04:38.889> actually<00:04:39.889> that's<00:04:40.280> really<00:04:40.699> exciting<00:04:41.000> it

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
ooh actually that's really exciting it

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.439 
ooh actually that's really exciting it
comes<00:04:41.479> with<00:04:41.660> a<00:04:41.690> full<00:04:42.020> battery<00:04:43.180> so<00:04:44.180> I<00:04:44.210> guess

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
comes with a full battery so I guess

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.540 
comes with a full battery so I guess
this<00:04:44.630> is<00:04:44.780> the<00:04:44.810> end<00:04:44.930> of<00:04:45.169> the<00:04:45.320> video<00:04:45.620> I<00:04:45.949> do<00:04:46.130> plan

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
this is the end of the video I do plan

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.890 
this is the end of the video I do plan
on<00:04:46.610> doing<00:04:47.120> benchmark<00:04:47.690> tests<00:04:48.789> how<00:04:49.789> it<00:04:50.000> reacts

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
on doing benchmark tests how it reacts

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.089 
on doing benchmark tests how it reacts
to<00:04:51.340> some<00:04:52.340> high<00:04:52.520> FPS<00:04:53.020> you<00:04:54.020> know<00:04:54.110> high<00:04:54.530> you<00:04:55.010> know

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:55.099 
to some high FPS you know high you know

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
because like I said before I was really

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.250 
because like I said before I was really
iffy<00:05:16.430> about<00:05:16.460> this<00:05:16.849> not<00:05:17.060> because<00:05:17.240> of<00:05:17.360> the<00:05:17.599> you

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
iffy about this not because of the you

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.870 
iffy about this not because of the you
know<00:05:18.320> the<00:05:18.409> reviews<00:05:18.860> or<00:05:19.220> the<00:05:19.280> quality<00:05:19.669> just

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
know the reviews or the quality just

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.409 
know the reviews or the quality just
because<00:05:20.180> I<00:05:20.210> didn't<00:05:20.930> get<00:05:21.139> to<00:05:22.030> actually<00:05:23.030> have<00:05:23.389> it

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
because I didn't get to actually have it

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:25.149 
because I didn't get to actually have it
in<00:05:23.690> my<00:05:23.840> hands<00:05:24.080> before<00:05:24.440> I<00:05:24.470> purchased<00:05:24.949> it<00:05:25.099> and
