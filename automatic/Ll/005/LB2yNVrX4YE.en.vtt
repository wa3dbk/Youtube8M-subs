arm at the time of death we also know

treatment and it can lead to paranoia I
don't<00:01:14.549> know<00:01:14.729> whether<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.600> was<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.930> case

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
don't know whether that was the case

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.200 
don't know whether that was the case
with<00:01:16.890> Robin<00:01:17.310> Williams<00:01:17.610> but<00:01:17.729> it's<00:01:17.880> certainly<00:01:18.030> a

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
with Robin Williams but it's certainly a

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.469 
with Robin Williams but it's certainly a
possibility<00:01:19.250> also<00:01:20.250> his<00:01:20.520> widow<00:01:20.790> mentions<00:01:21.299> that

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
possibility also his widow mentions that

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.490 
possibility also his widow mentions that

because he'd been sleep talking quite
loudly<00:01:27.930> now<00:01:28.350> we<00:01:28.409> know<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.979> Parkinson's

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
loudly now we know in Parkinson's

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.310 
loudly now we know in Parkinson's
disease<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.560> body<00:01:32.479> loses<00:01:33.479> its<00:01:33.930> ability

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
to remain inhibited during REM sleep so

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.410 
to remain inhibited during REM sleep so
dreams<00:01:37.500> get<00:01:37.680> acted<00:01:38.040> out<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.670> symptom<00:01:39.299> of

this is increased sleep talking I have

this is increased sleep talking I have
no<00:01:44.970> doubt<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.479> Robin<00:01:46.200> Williams<00:01:46.470> doctors

no doubt that Robin Williams doctors

no doubt that Robin Williams doctors
were<00:01:47.100> working<00:01:47.460> very<00:01:47.729> hard<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:48.720> treat<00:01:49.320> him<00:01:49.500> but

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
were working very hard to treat him but

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.550 
were working very hard to treat him but
