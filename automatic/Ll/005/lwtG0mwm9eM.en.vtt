00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.960
 how about friends welcome to your channel 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.230
 rowling 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:22.250
 they are always asking me to edit a 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:24.880
 video with my cleaning routine and 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.430
 hydration or skin care 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.579
 but it would really come out very long so 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.260
 we are going to give it in small tips in 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:37.039
 several videos 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:40.010
 the one I like the most is the step of 

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:42.890
 exfoliation of our skin because it is 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.829
 very important to keep the skin clean 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:50.300
 depth especially if we are using 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:54.620
 the anti-wrinkle oil of horsetail 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:57.770
 there are several videos where I have exposed 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.060
 options to exfoliate the skin with oats 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:05.590
 with clay and they are very good 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:09.610
 but my favorite is to exfoliate the skin with 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:13.090
 coconut oil because coconut oil 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:16.900
 it contains microparticles and it is also very 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.730
 moisturizing these microparticles are going to 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.550
 penetrate the pores and we are going to 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:24.100
 clean deep and at the same time they will 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.700
 fine tune because we're going to have a step in 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.750
 this spoliation to tune the pores 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:35.020
 with rose water 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.299
 then we went to prove it 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.929
 you can do the exfoliation with 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:42.520
 coconut oil is usually by 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:46.730
 what a little coconut oil in your 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:51.920
 hand and begins to massage her face 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:55.250
 but the most effective is when the oil 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.300
 of coconut is finished and the residue remains 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.030
 end of the bottle 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.760
 it also serves the residue of the oil of 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.220
 homemade coconut that you make at home with 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.470
 the video that I showed you makes a 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.240
 time ago I'll leave it in a link 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.060
 close to the video 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.660
 you are going to exfoliate with your hands 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.810
 Gently with oil swells 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.120
 of coconut because the coconut oil like it 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.340
 I said it has microparticles but 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.130
 when it ends almost the majority of 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.460
 these microparticles are at rest at 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.650
 end of the jar then you are going to 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.440
 take that residue full of 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.620
 microparticles and will massage your 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.940
 face 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:45.680
 for a time that you stipulate 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.680
 and the step that follows 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:55.080
 remove that excess coconut oil and 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:58.720
 those micro particles with rose water 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:02.400
 it will soak 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:05.819
 in rose water in cotton well 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.310
 soaked well soaked 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.170
 almost like to wash your face with water 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.130
 of roses but you will retire it with 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.090
 the cotton 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.700
 and you will notice how the pores are going 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.760
 at the end and they will be clean 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.160
 you can do this three operation 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.940
 times a week because he 's a student 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:32.230
 very effective but very soft serves to 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:34.360
 all kinds of skins, only if you 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.300
 dry skin and very mature then only 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.600
 remove with plenty of rose water and a 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:44.140
 cotton and leave it but if your skin is 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:47.650
 very young or is it greasy then you are 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:50.560
 rinse with your favorite gel in another 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.890
 video and we'll talk about what kind of 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:57.940
 natural gels or soaps we can use 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:01.610
 to remove excess masks or 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:05.540
 of facial creams that you use 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.950
 the coconut oil is anti wrinkle so 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.770
 it also has a little bit of protection 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.380
 solar this kind of exfoliation can 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.780
 do in the morning in the afternoon or in the 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.600
 night 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.880
 It will not hurt any time the 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.459
 schedule you choose 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.740
 It's one of my favorites because I can 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.210
 Repeat several times a week and 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.729
 clean at depth 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.580
 share this video with people who 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:33.530
