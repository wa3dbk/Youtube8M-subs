00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
because he was interested in this idea

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.920 
because he was interested in this idea
of<00:04:05.360> secrecy<00:04:05.930> and<00:04:06.380> how<00:04:07.570> there's<00:04:08.570> a<00:04:08.630> vagueness

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
of secrecy and how there's a vagueness

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.440 
of secrecy and how there's a vagueness
of<00:04:09.230> it<00:04:09.410> and<00:04:09.560> there's<00:04:09.680> also<00:04:09.860> a<00:04:09.980> sexual<00:04:10.880> energy

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
of it and there's also a sexual energy

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.199 
of it and there's also a sexual energy
with<00:04:11.690> it<00:04:11.870> and<00:04:12.140> but<00:04:12.350> it's<00:04:12.530> still<00:04:13.660> unknown<00:04:14.660> and

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
with it and but it's still unknown and

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.880 
with it and but it's still unknown and
who<00:04:17.209> knows<00:04:17.420> what<00:04:17.630> happens<00:04:17.900> in<00:04:18.050> this<00:04:18.200> club<00:04:18.500> I

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
who knows what happens in this club I

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.080 
who knows what happens in this club I
like<00:04:19.310> this<00:04:19.430> idea<00:04:19.610> of<00:04:19.910> how<00:04:21.640> the<00:04:22.640> video<00:04:22.880> just

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
like this idea of how the video just

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.170 
like this idea of how the video just
ends<00:04:23.930> with<00:04:24.800> them<00:04:24.980> eating<00:04:25.310> pizza<00:04:25.670> and<00:04:25.700> sort<00:04:26.060> of

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
ends with them eating pizza and sort of

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.810 
ends with them eating pizza and sort of
talking<00:04:26.510> but<00:04:27.080> the<00:04:27.770> the<00:04:28.250> viewer<00:04:28.490> can

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
talking but the the viewer can

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.090 
talking but the the viewer can
ultimately<00:04:29.420> decide<00:04:29.840> what<00:04:30.080> happens<00:04:30.290> with<00:04:30.890> it

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
ultimately decide what happens with it

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.550 
ultimately decide what happens with it
from<00:04:32.030> all<00:04:32.420> the<00:04:32.750> different<00:04:35.290> aspects<00:04:36.290> of<00:04:36.410> the
