00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:11.379
 fifa 10 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:13.740
 the main offensive reference 2010 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.479
 in relation to the other versions 

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:17.679
 control. 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:20.970
 the matches are all fast paced intense 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.100
 the players run frantically 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.100
 this says potentes popocando every moment 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.610
 leaves the scene the realism head of the productions in high definition 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.380
 appears in place the rush al-amari strike days 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.690
 to kick 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.160
 but welcome them minima 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.679
 in addition the well conditioned players due in speed 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:58.549
 are a real bomb a right until the next day to celebrate 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.870
 well done indefensible 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.680
 in fact the mechanical action is easy to learn ends up being a point 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.650
 positive 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.520
 and also a problem 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.140
 novice players will have no difficulty learning the schema 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.860
 but once it dominates it the matches seem to leave the domain of the 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.460
 football and flirt with basketball featuring elastic placemats with 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.460
 many and many goals 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.830
 protested occurred also in charges of stop ball 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.770
 as penalties fouls and slots more than they need and training the accounts that 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.280
 managed to land control at the correct time 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.720
 when the ball first day of French competition 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.870
 doing this ensures good football 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.010
 so with a beautiful defense for who is on the other side 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.570
 in a correct way the visual leaves aside the ambition of the realism defeat by 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.490
 a cartoon style hoisted very similar to that seen in butters bars 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.699
 lost in details macedo stamped lines are totally actions 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:14.700
 the work is well done 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.700
 and even the animations are complex 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:21.769
 cleverly there and tribe competition this Sunday 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:24.499
 with a beautiful artistic style 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:27.499
 it is impossible to perform competently 

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:39.610
 in game modes 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.520
 There is also a wide range of the 16 largest 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.430
 custom exterior derex all the indices of contesting the tournaments and championships of 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.819
 various parts of the planet 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.589
 likewise the option of facing the team coach 

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:56.339
 I want season titles 

00:02:56.339 --> 00:03:00.439
 but for example nothing of the way via prouni in thesis command only an athlete 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:05.469
 accumulate these stable conditions extreme simplicity of options 

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:09.199
 at most parties for up to four people inside 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:12.350
 I did all this crap a lot 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.389
 the order for serious limitations of purpose 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:19.790
 unfortunately, the controls sin for the exaggerated simplicity that soon 

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:24.409
 disbursed for repetitive matches piloted of goals a phrase of the minister 

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:29.049
 so I admit but the scarcity of party options in relation to 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.259
 other nations generates a certain disappointment
