graphics<00:00:11.780> here<00:00:11.900> today<00:00:12.889> we're<00:00:13.099> going<00:00:13.190> to<00:00:13.279> talk

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:13.519 
graphics here today we're going to talk

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.119 
graphics here today we're going to talk
about<00:00:13.750> the<00:00:14.750> amount<00:00:14.929> of<00:00:15.049> stretch<00:00:15.500> that<00:00:15.740> you<00:00:15.799> put

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:16.129 
about the amount of stretch that you put

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.390 
about the amount of stretch that you put
into<00:00:16.279> vinyl<00:00:16.699> when<00:00:17.329> you're<00:00:17.449> doing<00:00:17.689> a<00:00:17.750> car<00:00:17.989> at

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
into vinyl when you're doing a car at

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.819 
into vinyl when you're doing a car at
one<00:00:19.400> of<00:00:19.520> the<00:00:19.579> most<00:00:19.759> common<00:00:20.210> reasons<00:00:20.750> for<00:00:20.869> vinyl

00:00:21.819 --> 00:00:21.829 
one of the most common reasons for vinyl

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:24.459 
one of the most common reasons for vinyl
lifting<00:00:22.460> out<00:00:22.610> of<00:00:22.640> a<00:00:22.820> recess<00:00:23.239> or<00:00:23.509> or<00:00:24.020> lifting

00:00:24.459 --> 00:00:24.469 
lifting out of a recess or or lifting

00:00:24.469 --> 00:00:26.019 
lifting out of a recess or or lifting
off<00:00:24.590> the<00:00:24.739> off<00:00:24.950> the<00:00:24.980> plane<00:00:25.250> of<00:00:25.369> vehicle<00:00:25.759> is

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
off the off the plane of vehicle is

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.600 
off the off the plane of vehicle is
because<00:00:26.570> it's<00:00:26.689> been<00:00:26.840> over<00:00:27.110> stretched<00:00:27.500> a<00:00:28.099> lot

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:28.610 
because it's been over stretched a lot

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.190 
because it's been over stretched a lot
of<00:00:28.669> people<00:00:28.849> don't<00:00:29.029> realize<00:00:29.419> that<00:00:29.450> there

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.200 
of people don't realize that there

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.929 
of people don't realize that there
actually<00:00:30.320> is<00:00:30.529> a<00:00:30.619> maximum<00:00:31.250> stretch<00:00:31.669> that<00:00:31.849> you

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
actually is a maximum stretch that you

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:34.060 
actually is a maximum stretch that you
should<00:00:32.149> put<00:00:32.360> into<00:00:32.629> into<00:00:32.930> the<00:00:33.020> film<00:00:33.260> and<00:00:33.530> for

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
should put into into the film and for

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.450 
should put into into the film and for
most<00:00:34.250> cast<00:00:34.610> vinyls<00:00:35.239> that<00:00:36.200> maximum<00:00:36.680> stretch<00:00:37.100> is

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
most cast vinyls that maximum stretch is

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.780 
most cast vinyls that maximum stretch is
30%<00:00:38.360> so<00:00:38.899> you<00:00:38.960> shouldn't<00:00:39.230> stretch<00:00:39.530> the<00:00:39.710> film<00:00:39.949> by

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
30% so you shouldn't stretch the film by

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.270 
30% so you shouldn't stretch the film by
more<00:00:41.120> than<00:00:41.270> 30%<00:00:41.720> of<00:00:42.050> the<00:00:42.230> original<00:00:42.290> length<00:00:42.739> if

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
more than 30% of the original length if

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.520 
more than 30% of the original length if
you<00:00:43.640> do<00:00:43.940> you<00:00:44.420> put<00:00:44.600> a<00:00:44.630> lot<00:00:44.810> of<00:00:44.900> stress<00:00:45.110> into<00:00:45.410> it

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
you do you put a lot of stress into it

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.560 
you do you put a lot of stress into it
you've<00:00:46.160> thinned<00:00:46.579> out<00:00:46.730> the<00:00:46.790> adhesive<00:00:47.329> the

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
you've thinned out the adhesive the

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.090 
you've thinned out the adhesive the
film's<00:00:47.870> are<00:00:47.960> much<00:00:48.110> more<00:00:48.320> likely<00:00:48.710> to<00:00:48.739> lift<00:00:48.980> off

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
film's are much more likely to lift off

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.830 
film's are much more likely to lift off
the<00:00:49.220> surface<00:00:49.610> so<00:00:50.090> we<00:00:50.180> need<00:00:50.420> to<00:00:50.540> keep<00:00:50.690> that

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
the surface so we need to keep that

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.470 
the surface so we need to keep that
stretch<00:00:51.170> under<00:00:51.620> 30%<00:00:52.250> but<00:00:53.120> one<00:00:53.300> of<00:00:53.420> the

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
stretch under 30% but one of the

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.479 
stretch under 30% but one of the
problems<00:00:53.840> is<00:00:53.960> that<00:00:54.140> film<00:00:54.890> will<00:00:55.160> actually

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
problems is that film will actually

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.000 
problems is that film will actually
stretch<00:00:55.820> a<00:00:56.000> lot<00:00:56.239> more<00:00:56.630> than<00:00:56.840> 30%<00:00:57.170> you<00:00:57.739> can<00:00:57.860> push

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
stretch a lot more than 30% you can push

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.860 
stretch a lot more than 30% you can push
it<00:00:58.130> way<00:00:58.309> beyond<00:00:58.640> that<00:00:58.820> to<00:00:59.000> 100%<00:00:59.360> I<00:00:59.690> don't<00:00:59.809> know

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
it way beyond that to 100% I don't know

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.959 
it way beyond that to 100% I don't know
50<00:01:00.170> percent<00:01:00.290> if<00:01:01.130> you<00:01:01.250> do<00:01:01.430> that<00:01:01.579> it's<00:01:01.850> almost

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
50 percent if you do that it's almost

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:03.130 
50 percent if you do that it's almost
guaranteed<00:01:02.510> that<00:01:02.540> the<00:01:02.719> film<00:01:02.899> is<00:01:02.960> going<00:01:03.050> to

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
guaranteed that the film is going to

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.830 
guaranteed that the film is going to
lift<00:01:03.350> out<00:01:03.500> of<00:01:03.530> that<00:01:03.739> town<00:01:03.950> recess<00:01:04.659> so<00:01:05.659> one<00:01:05.810> of

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
lift out of that town recess so one of

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.539 
lift out of that town recess so one of
the<00:01:05.960> important<00:01:06.380> things<00:01:06.560> to<00:01:06.770> do<00:01:06.920> when<00:01:07.399> you're

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
the important things to do when you're

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:09.459 
the important things to do when you're
starting<00:01:07.790> off<00:01:08.060> on<00:01:08.270> a<00:01:08.299> on<00:01:08.450> a<00:01:08.479> deeper<00:01:08.840> wrap<00:01:09.020> is

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:09.469 
starting off on a on a deeper wrap is

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.560 
starting off on a on a deeper wrap is
making<00:01:10.070> sure<00:01:10.310> that<00:01:10.700> you're<00:01:11.180> not<00:01:11.299> going<00:01:11.479> to

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
making sure that you're not going to

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.510 
making sure that you're not going to
exceed<00:01:11.840> their<00:01:12.020> boobs<00:01:12.259> in<00:01:12.560> stretch<00:01:12.829> mark

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
exceed their boobs in stretch mark

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.020 
exceed their boobs in stretch mark
the<00:01:15.240> vehicle<00:01:16.070> so<00:01:17.070> how<00:01:17.189> can<00:01:17.250> we<00:01:17.399> do<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.640> can<00:01:17.820> we

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
the vehicle so how can we do that can we

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.639 
the vehicle so how can we do that can we
actually<00:01:18.240> measure<00:01:18.540> how<00:01:18.840> much<00:01:19.110> stretch<00:01:19.470> we're

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
actually measure how much stretch we're

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:21.289 
actually measure how much stretch we're
going<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.799> put<00:01:19.950> into<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.189> pill<00:01:20.399> when<00:01:20.909> we<00:01:21.030> apply

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
going to put into the pill when we apply

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.450 
going to put into the pill when we apply
it<00:01:21.360> down<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:21.810> recess<00:01:22.229> we<00:01:22.770> can<00:01:22.979> exact<00:01:23.340> it

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
it down to this recess we can exact it

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.760 
it down to this recess we can exact it
very<00:01:23.610> very<00:01:23.729> simple<00:01:24.320> so<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.409> tools<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.710> we

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
very very simple so the tools that we

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.789 
very very simple so the tools that we
need<00:01:25.920> fairly<00:01:26.729> simple<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.270> strip<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.140> paper<00:01:28.320> this

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
need fairly simple a strip of paper this

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.039 
need fairly simple a strip of paper this
is<00:01:28.860> just<00:01:29.130> plain<00:01:29.340> photocopy<00:01:30.030> paper<00:01:30.149> it's<00:01:30.899> about

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
is just plain photocopy paper it's about

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.330 
is just plain photocopy paper it's about

village<00:01:32.850> boy<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.390> doesn't<00:01:33.539> really<00:01:33.689> matter<00:01:33.899> too

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
village boy it doesn't really matter too

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.370 
village boy it doesn't really matter too
much<00:01:34.110> exactly<00:01:34.530> what<00:01:34.799> size<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.189> this<00:01:35.539> pen<00:01:36.539> and<00:01:36.720> a

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
replicate what I'm going to do with the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.440 
replicate what I'm going to do with the
vial<00:01:49.350> when<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.159> initially<00:01:50.369> laid<00:01:50.819> is<00:01:50.970> final<00:01:51.330> it's

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
vial when I initially laid is final it's

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.300 
vial when I initially laid is final it's
going<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.659> bridge<00:01:52.259> across<00:01:52.289> that<00:01:52.890> bridge

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
going to bridge across that bridge

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.249 
going to bridge across that bridge
across<00:01:53.459> that<00:01:53.729> recess<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:54.780> I'm<00:01:54.869> gonna<00:01:54.990> breach

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
across that recess so I'm gonna breach

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.230 
across that recess so I'm gonna breach
the<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.770> paper<00:01:55.979> across<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.459> like<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.789> then

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
the the paper across it like that then

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.080 
the the paper across it like that then
with<00:01:57.450> my<00:01:57.569> pen<00:01:57.869> I'm<00:01:58.170> gonna<00:01:58.440> make<00:01:58.679> a<00:01:58.709> mark<00:01:59.090> where

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
with my pen I'm gonna make a mark where

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.539 
with my pen I'm gonna make a mark where
the<00:02:00.209> beginning<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.720> the<00:02:00.810> recess<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:02.369> when

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
the beginning of the recess is and when

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.389 
the beginning of the recess is and when
the<00:02:02.580> end<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:02.819> the<00:02:02.880> recess<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:04.350> what<00:02:05.310> I've

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
the end of the recess is so what I've

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.639 
the end of the recess is so what I've
done<00:02:05.549> there<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.880> actually<00:02:06.149> mark<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.810> amount

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
done there is actually mark the amount

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.430 
done there is actually mark the amount
of<00:02:07.770> vinyl<00:02:08.519> that<00:02:08.549> I<00:02:08.729> have<00:02:08.970> can<00:02:09.630> now<00:02:09.780> push<00:02:10.140> down

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
of vinyl that I have can now push down

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.460 
of vinyl that I have can now push down
into<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:10.950> recess<00:02:11.750> so<00:02:12.750> what<00:02:12.900> I'll<00:02:12.989> do<00:02:13.170> is<00:02:13.200> I'm

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
into that recess so what I'll do is I'm

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.220 
into that recess so what I'll do is I'm
gonna<00:02:13.739> hold<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.190> top<00:02:14.430> of<00:02:14.459> that<00:02:14.989> hold<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.080> top

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
gonna hold the top of that hold the top

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.570 
gonna hold the top of that hold the top
of<00:02:16.319> that<00:02:16.410> paper<00:02:16.590> steady<00:02:16.890> so<00:02:17.069> it<00:02:17.160> doesn't<00:02:17.400> move

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
of that paper steady so it doesn't move

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.940 
of that paper steady so it doesn't move
and<00:02:17.910> again<00:02:18.900> replicating<00:02:19.560> what<00:02:19.680> I'm<00:02:19.799> going<00:02:19.920> to

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
and again replicating what I'm going to

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.800 
and again replicating what I'm going to
do<00:02:20.100> with<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.609> vinyl<00:02:20.850> when<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.209> apply<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.540> I

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
do with the vinyl when I apply it I

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.349 
do with the vinyl when I apply it I
would<00:02:22.290> work<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.010> vial<00:02:23.459> down<00:02:23.730> into<00:02:24.269> that

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:24.359 
would work the vial down into that

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:26.120 
would work the vial down into that
recess<00:02:24.810> I'm<00:02:24.959> gonna<00:02:25.079> push<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.500> paper<00:02:25.709> down<00:02:25.950> in

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
recess I'm gonna push the paper down in

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.890 
recess I'm gonna push the paper down in
that<00:02:26.220> recess<00:02:26.640> until<00:02:26.940> it<00:02:27.150> makes<00:02:27.299> full<00:02:27.510> contact

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
that recess until it makes full contact

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.770 
that recess until it makes full contact
with<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.140> surface<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.980> now<00:02:29.910> I'm<00:02:30.239> gonna<00:02:30.480> mark

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
with the surface and now I'm gonna mark

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.060 
with the surface and now I'm gonna mark
the<00:02:30.989> new<00:02:31.230> location<00:02:31.950> of<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:34.380> bottom<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.829> the

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
the new location of the bottom of the

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.150 
the new location of the bottom of the
recess<00:02:36.019> okay<00:02:37.019> so<00:02:37.079> the<00:02:37.590> distance<00:02:37.980> between

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
recess okay so the distance between

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.370 
recess okay so the distance between
these<00:02:38.459> first<00:02:38.790> two<00:02:39.030> marks<00:02:39.420> was<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.930> original

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
these first two marks was the original

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.110 
these first two marks was the original
length<00:02:40.590> of<00:02:40.829> the<00:02:40.890> film<00:02:41.190> that<00:02:41.280> we<00:02:41.400> had<00:02:41.579> bridge<00:02:41.910> to

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
length of the film that we had bridge to

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.110 
length of the film that we had bridge to
cross<00:02:42.299> the<00:02:43.109> recess<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.799> then<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.790> distance

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
cross the recess and then the distance

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.569 
cross the recess and then the distance
between<00:02:45.269> these<00:02:45.750> two<00:02:46.109> marks<00:02:46.319> is<00:02:46.950> how<00:02:47.220> much<00:02:47.400> we

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
between these two marks is how much we

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.670 
between these two marks is how much we
had<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.760> stretch<00:02:48.299> it<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.989> actually<00:02:49.350> push<00:02:49.650> it

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
had to stretch it to actually push it

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.039 
had to stretch it to actually push it
down<00:02:49.980> into<00:02:50.280> that<00:02:50.489> recess<00:02:50.910> so<00:02:51.540> what<00:02:51.720> we<00:02:51.810> want<00:02:51.959> to

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
down into that recess so what we want to

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.699 
down into that recess so what we want to
figure<00:02:52.230> out<00:02:52.319> is<00:02:53.269> what<00:02:54.269> percentage<00:02:54.959> is<00:02:55.170> that

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
figure out is what percentage is that

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.849 
figure out is what percentage is that
stretch<00:02:56.220> of<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:57.690> original<00:02:58.319> length<00:02:58.500> of<00:02:58.650> film

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
stretch of the original length of film

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:00.410 
stretch of the original length of film
that<00:02:58.980> we<00:02:59.069> had<00:02:59.250> this<00:02:59.730> is<00:02:59.790> where<00:03:00.060> we<00:03:00.120> use<00:03:00.269> our

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
that we had this is where we use our

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.030 
that we had this is where we use our
ruler

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
ruler

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.710 
ruler
so<00:03:02.519> what<00:03:02.640> I'm<00:03:02.700> gonna<00:03:02.790> do<00:03:02.940> is<00:03:03.060> actually<00:03:03.269> measure

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
so what I'm gonna do is actually measure

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.320 
so what I'm gonna do is actually measure
the<00:03:04.680> distance<00:03:05.069> of<00:03:05.400> original<00:03:05.970> film<00:03:06.150> that<00:03:06.269> we

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
the distance of original film that we

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.970 
the distance of original film that we
had<00:03:06.450> that's<00:03:06.659> about<00:03:06.810> 16<00:03:07.260> millimeters<00:03:07.739> or<00:03:07.830> so

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
had that's about 16 millimeters or so

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.339 
had that's about 16 millimeters or so
and<00:03:08.280> then<00:03:08.940> measure<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.810> amount<00:03:10.019> of<00:03:10.080> stretch

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
and then measure the amount of stretch

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.289 
and then measure the amount of stretch
that<00:03:10.440> we<00:03:10.560> put<00:03:10.739> into<00:03:10.860> the<00:03:11.040> film<00:03:11.459> and<00:03:11.700> that's

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
that we put into the film and that's

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.809 
that we put into the film and that's
about<00:03:12.450> 4<00:03:12.690> millimeters<00:03:13.170> so<00:03:13.920> we<00:03:14.010> had<00:03:14.129> 16

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
about 4 millimeters so we had 16

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.309 
about 4 millimeters so we had 16
millimeters<00:03:15.239> of<00:03:15.360> film<00:03:15.569> and<00:03:15.780> we've<00:03:16.019> stretched

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
millimeters of film and we've stretched

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.140 
millimeters of film and we've stretched
it<00:03:16.530> by<00:03:16.650> 4<00:03:16.950> so<00:03:17.700> 4<00:03:17.970> over<00:03:18.000> 16<00:03:18.540> that's<00:03:19.110> 25%<00:03:20.030> which<00:03:21.030> is

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
it by 4 so 4 over 16 that's 25% which is

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.600 
it by 4 so 4 over 16 that's 25% which is
under<00:03:21.420> our<00:03:21.569> 30%<00:03:22.290> limit<00:03:22.410> so<00:03:22.980> that<00:03:23.010> this

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
under our 30% limit so that this

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.390 
under our 30% limit so that this
particular<00:03:23.940> recess<00:03:24.480> is<00:03:24.840> 25%<00:03:25.470> stretch<00:03:25.920> which

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
particular recess is 25% stretch which

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.360 
particular recess is 25% stretch which
is<00:03:26.549> within<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:27.360> limits<00:03:27.690> of<00:03:27.840> 30%<00:03:28.379> for<00:03:29.040> our<00:03:29.129> cast

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
is within the limits of 30% for our cast

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.110 
is within the limits of 30% for our cast
cast<00:03:29.910> vinyl<00:03:30.120> so<00:03:30.540> that<00:03:30.720> recess<00:03:31.079> is<00:03:31.200> okay<00:03:32.090> one<00:03:33.090> of

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
cast vinyl so that recess is okay one of

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.699 
cast vinyl so that recess is okay one of
the<00:03:33.269> important<00:03:33.870> reasons<00:03:34.019> for<00:03:34.319> doing<00:03:34.590> this

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
the important reasons for doing this

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.710 
the important reasons for doing this
test<00:03:35.010> is<00:03:35.190> a<00:03:35.430> lot<00:03:35.700> of<00:03:35.819> resources<00:03:36.180> can<00:03:36.420> be<00:03:36.450> very

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
test is a lot of resources can be very

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.690 
test is a lot of resources can be very
deceiving<00:03:37.049> because<00:03:37.890> the<00:03:37.980> percentage<00:03:38.250> stretch

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
deceiving because the percentage stretch

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.670 
deceiving because the percentage stretch
that<00:03:38.849> you<00:03:38.910> put<00:03:39.120> into<00:03:39.239> the<00:03:39.360> film<00:03:39.599> doesn't<00:03:40.410> just

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
that you put into the film doesn't just

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.710 
that you put into the film doesn't just
depend<00:03:40.829> on<00:03:41.040> how<00:03:41.220> deep<00:03:41.519> the<00:03:41.549> recess<00:03:42.030> is<00:03:42.209> but

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
depend on how deep the recess is but

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.240 
depend on how deep the recess is but
also<00:03:42.989> definitely<00:03:43.140> how<00:03:43.410> wide<00:03:43.650> it<00:03:43.829> is<00:03:43.920> it's<00:03:44.190> a

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
also definitely how wide it is it's a

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.160 
also definitely how wide it is it's a
ratio<00:03:44.670> between<00:03:44.879> those<00:03:45.239> two<00:03:45.569> things<00:03:45.810> that

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
ratio between those two things that

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.119 
ratio between those two things that
determines<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.680> stretch<00:03:47.549> so<00:03:47.819> a<00:03:48.329> recess<00:03:48.750> that

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:49.129 
determines the stretch so a recess that

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:52.130 
determines the stretch so a recess that
is<00:03:50.129> not<00:03:50.340> very<00:03:50.519> deep<00:03:50.760> but<00:03:51.120> also<00:03:51.660> quite<00:03:51.870> narrow

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
is not very deep but also quite narrow

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.690 
is not very deep but also quite narrow
can<00:03:52.769> actually<00:03:53.010> have<00:03:53.160> quite<00:03:53.370> a<00:03:53.459> high

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
can actually have quite a high

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.130 
can actually have quite a high
percentage<00:03:53.940> stretch<00:03:54.569> and<00:03:54.840> that's<00:03:54.959> actually

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
percentage stretch and that's actually

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.559 
percentage stretch and that's actually
what<00:03:55.349> the<00:03:55.440> case<00:03:55.620> we've<00:03:55.769> got<00:03:55.799> here<00:03:56.160> the<00:03:56.910> recess

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
what the case we've got here the recess

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:58.940 
what the case we've got here the recess
in<00:03:57.690> this<00:03:57.780> vehicle<00:03:57.930> doesn't<00:03:58.349> look<00:03:58.560> very<00:03:58.590> deep

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
in this vehicle doesn't look very deep

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.130 
in this vehicle doesn't look very deep
it<00:03:59.099> doesn't<00:03:59.459> look<00:03:59.579> very<00:03:59.660> intimidating<00:04:00.660> but

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
it doesn't look very intimidating but

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.020 
it doesn't look very intimidating but
it's<00:04:01.290> 25%<00:04:01.769> it's<00:04:02.190> towards<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.609> upper<00:04:02.819> end<00:04:02.849> of

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
it's 25% it's towards the upper end of

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.000 
it's 25% it's towards the upper end of
its<00:04:03.150> central<00:04:03.450> level<00:04:03.690> of<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:03.840> stretch<00:04:04.079> so<00:04:04.530> if

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
its central level of the stretch so if

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.770 
its central level of the stretch so if
you<00:04:05.040> are<00:04:05.220> doing<00:04:05.370> vehicle<00:04:05.760> wraps<00:04:05.940> whether<00:04:06.630> they

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
you are doing vehicle wraps whether they

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.979 
you are doing vehicle wraps whether they
be<00:04:06.840> cars<00:04:07.349> or<00:04:07.650> vans<00:04:08.060> really<00:04:09.060> important<00:04:09.450> step<00:04:09.660> is

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
be cars or vans really important step is

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.750 
be cars or vans really important step is
to<00:04:10.049> make<00:04:10.500> sure<00:04:10.680> you<00:04:10.799> measure<00:04:11.040> that<00:04:11.220> stretch<00:04:11.519> to

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
to make sure you measure that stretch to

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.400 
to make sure you measure that stretch to
ensure<00:04:12.239> you're<00:04:12.450> not<00:04:12.480> going<00:04:12.720> to<00:04:12.780> exceed<00:04:13.019> that

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
ensure you're not going to exceed that

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.009 
ensure you're not going to exceed that
25%<00:04:13.980> maximum<00:04:14.639> the<00:04:14.880> recommended<00:04:15.299> stretch<00:04:15.569> for

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
25% maximum the recommended stretch for

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:24.900 
25% maximum the recommended stretch for
