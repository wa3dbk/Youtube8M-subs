 Murmansk airport probably never 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:26.259
 didn't see so many passengers with cameras 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.300
 binoculars and cameras are not all 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.509
 gathered here for a unique flight to 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.950
 solar eclipse strip 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:36.340
 pre-purchased tickets on board 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:40.620
 treasured boeing 737 are heard right 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:43.239
 here we are Stepan Elena 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.699
 besides professional astronomers and 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.339
 Lovers here are many journalists 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.620
 Here, for example, the operator reuters to prepare 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:52.989
 to eclipse makes solar

 airline employees they even 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.769
 cleaned each porthole from the snow 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:01.839
 to be more comfortable to watch 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.269
 him this sun is unique to Russia 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:07.409
 flight made possible by friendship 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.460
 two companies intelligence tour in art area 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.110
 initially planned trip another year 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.909
 back and now questions principle in 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.640
 Murmansk on observation themselves overshadow 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:19.270
 honest face we planned maybe 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.969
 come from bergen or on a ship in 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.700
 Ocean but nothing like we have to be able to 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:27.790
 go out for economic reasons in 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.369
 As a result, when we flew on a sled in the fall 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.500
 flight from Murmansk Moscow arbitrariness 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.200
 take off the beautiful and business aurora 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.590
 This photo we gave the pilot 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.980
 struck up a conversation with the narts made friends 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.200
 proper 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.180
 there was a general idea about why 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.190
 do not organize such a sheet 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.130
 mutually beneficial to all narts is good 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.200
 advertising move everyone knows about it for us 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.900
 this is an opportunity almost free 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.940
 cheese and eclipse sauce as a result it was decided 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.800
 fly to the north atlantic to area 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.400
 between iceland and norway 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.410
 73 degrees north latitude here the moon 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.860
 should have closed the sun a little more 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.990
 than two minutes on March 20th it was the most 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.230
 north raise to see full 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.650
 solar eclipse 1020 Moscow time 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.170
 time boeing 737 began its flight from 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.540
 Murmansk airport, we climbed higher 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.910
 clouds and moved towards the moon 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.890
 shadows pilots nordavia though not astra 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.540
 lovers but some astronomical 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.540
 the phenomenon was also observed 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.710
 especially often the aurora as well 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.710
 some eclipse 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:45.770
 total lunar eclipse of you pakistan and i 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.720
 seen once and the second time love to 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.060
 everyone managed to watch without problems 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:55.480
 eclipses the organizers held a full 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:57.250
 briefing hour 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.230
 six minutes 13 appears 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.530
 diamond ring on this take care 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.379
 full eclipse phase and you need 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.269
 diy juicy and the filters were completely 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:09.819
 different someone used the purchase 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.019
 someone brought the solar film with him 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.420
 welder mask 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:16.840
 and someone even made their own 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.650
 special glasses actually started it 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.739
 glasses 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.519
 since i am a physicist and chemist i have been 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.970
 donated 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:29.319
 here are these cars and chemical protection 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.909
 initially so that you can 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.569
 observe with the help of them the sun 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:34.939
 eclipse 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:39.400
 were pulled out segmental here and from 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:41.750
 cut and inserted here on the eyepiece lenses 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.879
 here is sleep itself 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.069
 5 contributed to the eyes 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:48.170
 protected during a solar eclipse 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.420
 but as soon as the plane hit the moon 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.790
 the shadow and the sky lit up diamond 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.730
 ring all filters were put aside 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:59.109
 side here it is a complete eclipse phase with 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.819
 heights 11 kilometers of the horizon along I am fat 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:04.970
 bright orange bay and ring around 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:07.370
 the sun lit the crown of almost 120 people 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.220
 clung to the porthole on the right 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.920
 board to enjoy this beauty 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.700
 someone was shooting an eclipse someone was admiring 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.310
 and through binoculars 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.289
 but with the first rays of the sun deafening 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.859
 applause 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:20.859
 observations failed 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.479
 everyone's emotions overlapped 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.750
 for many it was the first in life 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:37.060
 total solar eclipse including 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.270
 those famous astronomy popularizer 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.919
 Igor Tyrsky we literally 40 30 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.530
 seconds passed each other binoculars and 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.580
 for a minute managed to observe an eclipse 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.069
 man five to six 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.860
 Here's my binoculars completely different video 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:51.580
 than the eye so I recommend to everyone 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.009
 buy binoculars and 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.659
 and if there is a full phase only full in 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:57.940
 often taken for binoculars because you 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:05:00.430
 survive and your eyes only in full phase 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.500
 you can take binoculars and watch 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.930
 very beautiful crown and wading to be 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.250
 everything is perfectly clear you just sit 0 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.620
 just from this this 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.930
 it is an indescribable feeling impossible 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.639
 to describe it in words for such 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.440
 all of the words did not come up with their own 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:16.780
 shared with us and 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.139
 famous blogger Vitaly Yegorov 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:23.110
 from this flight I have learned to be among 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:24.520
 Thoughts probably the first is that it is not necessary 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.419
 it was easy to take a camera 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:30.880
 memorize and enjoy the spectacle 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:32.800
 the second is that for repetition 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.259
 like for successful repetition 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:39.669
 such events need your 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:42.039
 plane and just fly one and 3 if 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.810
 there is no plane then you have to fly to where 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:48.849
 solar eclipse will just pass on 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:50.949
 ground and equip already replenish your 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:53.770
 place of observation put several cameras 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:55.599
 which will shoot in different modes with 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.419
 different focal lengths and getting 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:06:01.539
 already more with the help of there several 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:04.810
 cameras zoom in picture overall picture 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:07.930
 to the one that is really half- eyed 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.550
 when waited for the illuminati on board this 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.740
 the day were the winners of Moscow 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.479
 Astronomical Olympiad for example 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.580
 Kirill Grishin a few years ago 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:17.860
 developed an application that 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.440
 calculate the visibility conditions of eclipses 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:23.260
 March 20, he finally managed to live 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.969
 see this phenomenon with many could 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.939
 applications 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:31.479
 they are like all things a year or two ago 

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:34.059
 Here I am too time ago 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:36.909
 same time steel movement calculation osago 

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:41.120
 what clones eclipses and created for want 

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:42.110
 when to read your message there 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.720
 this can be calculated in detail 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.790
 visibility by specific type 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.740
 item 1 and just kaunas that snake 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.060
 the embassy for the first time therefore 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.710
 accordingly I am taboo 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.260
 impressions at all become the whole 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.950
 life has become a real star captain 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.840
 aircraft 

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.840
 he had to sign autographs for a long time 

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.720
 on 1 

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:09.740
 Well, the real romance in it 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.870
 the trip brought stanislav short 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:14.750
 who made a marriage proposal 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:17.440
 your girlfriend ire is not right on board 

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.440
 aircraft
