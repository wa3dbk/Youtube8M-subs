this games gosh can a nerd getting
caught<00:02:20.819> rating<00:02:21.209> not<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.569> flappy<00:02:22.200> bird

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
caught rating not a flappy bird

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.860 
caught rating not a flappy bird
frustrating<00:02:23.610> but<00:02:26.209> there<00:02:27.209> you<00:02:27.420> go<00:02:27.629> and

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
frustrating but there you go and

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.130 
frustrating but there you go and
apparently<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:29.390> like<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.540> shorter<00:02:30.959> of

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
apparently the the like the shorter of

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.710 
apparently the the like the shorter of
the<00:02:31.200> rope<00:02:31.500> is<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:32.489> farther<00:02:32.879> he<00:02:32.910> can<00:02:33.269> jump<00:02:33.510> up

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
the rope is the farther he can jump up

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.420 
the rope is the farther he can jump up
so<00:02:34.560> that's<00:02:34.709> something<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.849> aim<00:02:36.620> towards<00:02:37.620> like

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
so that's something to aim towards like

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.569 
so that's something to aim towards like
make<00:02:39.290> make<00:02:40.290> your<00:02:40.440> rope<00:02:40.620> really<00:02:40.980> small<00:02:41.340> maybe

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579
