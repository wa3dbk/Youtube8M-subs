00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.389

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.219
 here today they will bring more than 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.619
 You a video of today, come back one 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.029
 aesthetic issue of the appliance design 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.770
 Galatians 4 minutes 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.340
 many people this video will be very 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.189
 useful but for others maybe help m10 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.750
 guys so I'll say what's on 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.519
 design of each audio video device of the 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.830
 short video maybe not interest 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:36.510
 many people who already know are here 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:38.700
 we have that handset so do not 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.440
 Can we tell you where the audio of the leagues comes from? 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.910
 sound is the guys here O 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.969
 up here over the prass goal 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.149
 here we have a front or 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.059
 whether you can shoot and take photos 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.980
 you give yourself the now known 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.780
 how self turned fashion 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.449
 people love modinhas and many 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.570
 Brazilians right then and sensors here are 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.280
 sensors are for the device to feel 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.489
 you feel the device if we can say 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.950
 so I went to a brief camera and I think 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.840
 We have a flash kid here. 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.570
 can improve the illumination of photos 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.659
 a tim a samsung inlays a logo tools 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.700
 the Korean logo to samsung is 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.939
 here for our volume so you can 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.090
 volume here for you to turn the 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.369
 here that audio output from the 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.240
 audio capture so many connections too 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:33.900
 and here for you to connect is the 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.670
 charger and usb and here that output 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.829
 that is positioned with the shape 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.840
 which I think is negative because if you want 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.570
 listen to music and leave the device 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.829
 so stuffy then recommended 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.630
 to leave this way stops the sun from getting 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:51.149
 broad and could say so here we 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.649
 we have a place to put the phone 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:02:00.060
 heard here also microphones and here we 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.170
 we have a led sensor too if I do not 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.060
 I was wrong, okay? 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.250
 I'm kind of not knowing what this is here. 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.170
 but if I'm not mistaken it's to control 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.759
 the television is the infrared sensor we 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.349
 if I 'm wrong, please 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.040
 correct in all the videos of the 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.260
 channel 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.099
 so it's basically this video nothing 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.980
 spectacular 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.840
 just show you what each one is 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.580
 device button because here the button 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.959
 home here turn on the plus button 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.670
 back information 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.319
 well that's it folks you should 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.290
 being with the other about technology and 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.290
 information knowledge is everything
