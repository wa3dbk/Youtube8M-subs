 he left a rest is without a doubt 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.460
 the flagship of the brand from its

 provide aesthetic changes and 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.140
 equipment its design distinguishes the 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:53.170
 new sanyo in reston w of the rest of the 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.940
 us best and especially great in the 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.129
 front part highlights the new front 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.340
 which includes optical groups with 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.140
 Daytime lighting and emblem rest 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.089
 triple line grid features

 and joe as well as the new hood and the 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.740
 lower bumper with turn signals and 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.690
 integrated fog lights to adapt 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.660
 better adapt to new trends 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.220
 of market design the profile of the 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.170
 new rest is especially 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.610
 attractive thanks to its high waist and 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.649
 the new alloy wheels 18 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.330
 inches the wide surface 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.399
 glazed as well as the crystals 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:28.479
 tinted as standard in all versions 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:31.000
 will provide an elegant look the 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.680
 rearview mirrors integrated led indicators 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.240
 in modernity and avant-garde design 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.580
 while behind the main 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.290
 What's new are the low bumper 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.560
 height and rear lights of the new 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.910
 design with lighting also by law 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.460
 all the dashboard is oriented towards 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.200
 the driver to facilitate its handling and 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.880
 we speak of its interior evidently and 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.340
 also has large glove boxes 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.560
 and a multitude of storage slots and 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.510
 grids to store magazines maps and 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.100
 all kinds of small objects that 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.170
 they constitute a danger if they are left 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.700
 loose in the passenger compartment and there's no need 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.710
 forget about that we're talking about 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.050
 of a car capable of seven seats with 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.210
 what this implies of looms between 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.030
 quotes always from all passengers 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.040
 in running regime the rest in w 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.739
 presents now with a new engine with 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.150
 more efficient less polluting and 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:20.470
 adapted to market trends 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.790
 called 200 x day and that is positioned 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.170
 as a reference in terms of 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.260
 benefits thanks to a delivery of 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.840
 power of 155 horses to 4000 laps 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.989
 with a maximum torque of 360 newtons already 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.700
 between 1,500 and 2,800 parameters that are 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.540
 able to move its immense mass to 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.100
 satisfaction 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.850
 obviously not to go racing 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.010
 even though 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.140
 if all seats are displayed by 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.790
 example we can talk about that the 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.250
 trunk is testimonial and it would be 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.450
 resort to a chest on the roof with what 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.980
 that its benefits would be 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.750
 remarkably modified and in those 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.330
 conditions the truth is that we have not 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.280
 tested accelerates and recovers well even 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.800
 loaded and with a consumption content of in 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.930
 around 7 liters if it's about 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.670
 have the whole the rest do not double 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.190
 It has a powerful braking equipment 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.320
 which guarantees a sufficient response 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.570
 before any emergency and a great 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.580
 resistance to fad and wheels 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.550
 front mount self-ventilated discs 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.200
 being solid the butts the abs the 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.300
 bea and the eve of distributors of 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.040
 braking or emergency braking are 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.520
 part of a correct operation in 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.140
 every moment the suspensions are 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.030
 independent on the front wheels 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.550
 with double trapeze of shock absorbers 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.990
 gas in the rear the novelty lies in 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.850
 which is also independent and with eight 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.400
 anchor points this scheme of 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.260
 suspension makes the rest w a 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.330
 extremely comfortable and efficient vehicle 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.100
 for everyday use in the city or 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.150
 road without losing for it the 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.010
 activity of the poles 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.379
 the steering is of assisted zipper and 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.450
 of progressive hardening and despite 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:49.610
 the generous dimensions of the rest 9 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.709
 double its turning radius is only 57 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.290
 meters the 4x4 traction system 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.849
 significantly increases the capacity of 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.220
 Advance in any situation or terrain 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:59.959
 thanks to the 4h position of the 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.450
 transmission with stable running up 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.069
 70 kilometers per hour for situations 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.680
 engaged in new rest double cloud 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.599
 adds in all 4x4 versions a 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.970
 gearbox so in the position 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:13.250
 4 l the traction system is capable of 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.859
 continue where it would seem even 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.900
 impossible in the end despite its 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:20.209
 Mastodontic figure can be even 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.859
 agile and comfortable it is certainly his 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.320
 value for money makes you 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.750
 a fearsome adversary for others 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.729
 sv of the large models obviously 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.970
 of seven places that there are currently in 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.970
 the market
