alignment<00:02:20.940> before<00:02:21.030> installing<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.750> new

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
alignment before installing the new

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.150 
alignment before installing the new
drive<00:02:22.820> with<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:23.940> alignment<00:02:24.420> tool<00:02:25.010> we<00:02:26.010> will

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
drive with the alignment tool we will

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.680 
drive with the alignment tool we will
insert<00:02:26.460> it<00:02:26.670> through<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:27.090> gimbal<00:02:27.360> bearing<00:02:27.390> it

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
insert it through the gimbal bearing it

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.170 
insert it through the gimbal bearing it
into<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:27.990> engine<00:02:28.110> coupler<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:29.340> what<00:02:30.060> you're

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
into the engine coupler and what you're

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.390 
into the engine coupler and what you're
looking<00:02:30.390> for<00:02:30.600> is<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.810> nice<00:02:31.020> smooth<00:02:31.500> transition

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
looking for is a nice smooth transition

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.980 
looking for is a nice smooth transition
through<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.090> bearing<00:02:33.390> into<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.750> engine

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
through the bearing into the engine

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.510 
through the bearing into the engine
coupler<00:02:34.320> until<00:02:34.650> you<00:02:34.740> hear<00:02:34.920> that<00:02:35.100> Clank<00:02:35.400> and

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
coupler until you hear that Clank and

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.430 
coupler until you hear that Clank and
that's<00:02:35.670> actually<00:02:36.000> as<00:02:36.240> it<00:02:36.660> hits<00:02:36.990> up<00:02:37.170> against

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
that's actually as it hits up against

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.230 
that's actually as it hits up against
the<00:02:37.530> engine<00:02:37.800> coupler<00:02:38.100> itself<00:02:39.470> like<00:02:40.470> so<00:02:41.060> now<00:02:42.060> if

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
the engine coupler itself like so now if

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.670 
the engine coupler itself like so now if
you<00:02:42.360> don't<00:02:42.540> have<00:02:42.840> good<00:02:43.080> engine<00:02:43.320> alignment

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
you don't have good engine alignment

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.650 
you don't have good engine alignment

now<00:05:55.320> that<00:05:55.470> we<00:05:55.560> have<00:05:55.680> the<00:05:55.800> starboard<00:05:56.220> side

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
now that we have the starboard side

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.219 
now that we have the starboard side
cylinder<00:05:57.419> on<00:05:57.570> we're<00:05:57.750> just<00:05:57.810> going<00:05:58.020> to<00:05:58.080> need<00:05:58.200> to

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:58.229 
cylinder on we're just going to need to

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:00.350 
cylinder on we're just going to need to
put<00:05:58.440> the<00:05:58.560> washers<00:05:59.010> and<00:05:59.280> the<00:05:59.460> Eclipse<00:05:59.910> on<00:06:00.120> as

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:17.169 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:19.089 

next<00:06:18.169> we're<00:06:18.289> going<00:06:18.379> to<00:06:18.439> be<00:06:18.560> installing<00:06:18.889> the

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:19.099 
next we're going to be installing the

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:21.610 
next we're going to be installing the
trim<00:06:19.310> tab<00:06:19.550> a<00:06:19.580> node<00:06:19.939> and<00:06:20.180> to<00:06:20.930> do<00:06:21.050> so<00:06:21.259> we<00:06:21.500> will

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 
trim tab a node and to do so we will

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.709 
trim tab a node and to do so we will
first<00:06:21.800> have<00:06:22.069> to<00:06:22.099> remove<00:06:22.310> the<00:06:22.759> rubber<00:06:23.240> plug<00:06:23.479> in

00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:23.719 
first have to remove the rubber plug in

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:25.689 
first have to remove the rubber plug in
the<00:06:23.810> upper<00:06:24.050> unit<00:06:24.319> we<00:06:24.860> will<00:06:24.949> be<00:06:25.129> using<00:06:25.520> a

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:25.699 
the upper unit we will be using a

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:27.820 
the upper unit we will be using a
directional<00:06:26.449> trim<00:06:26.719> tab<00:06:26.960> a<00:06:26.990> node<00:06:27.319> and<00:06:27.500> if<00:06:27.740> you

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830 
directional trim tab a node and if you

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.709 
directional trim tab a node and if you
remember<00:06:28.009> we<00:06:28.250> actually<00:06:28.430> installed<00:06:29.270> the<00:06:29.449> trim

00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:29.719 
remember we actually installed the trim

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:32.260 
remember we actually installed the trim
tab<00:06:29.900> bolt<00:06:30.280> prior<00:06:31.280> and<00:06:31.550> it's<00:06:31.819> actually<00:06:32.120> already

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:32.270 
tab bolt prior and it's actually already

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.240 
tab bolt prior and it's actually already
between<00:06:32.629> the<00:06:32.810> two<00:06:32.960> halves<00:06:33.169> so<00:06:33.889> we'll<00:06:33.979> take<00:06:34.099> our

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.250 
between the two halves so we'll take our

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.709 
between the two halves so we'll take our
half<00:06:34.460> inch<00:06:34.729> drive<00:06:34.909> and<00:06:36.039> we<00:06:37.039> will<00:06:37.389> line<00:06:38.389> up<00:06:38.419> the

00:06:38.709 --> 00:06:38.719 
half inch drive and we will line up the

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:40.899 
half inch drive and we will line up the
trim<00:06:38.960> tab<00:06:39.139> a<00:06:39.409> node<00:06:39.650> in<00:06:39.860> the<00:06:40.550> straight-ahead

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:40.909

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:54.919 
trim tab a node in the straight-ahead

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:56.649 
trim tab a node in the straight-ahead
position<00:06:55.039> being<00:06:55.669> that<00:06:55.909> it<00:06:56.120> does<00:06:56.270> have<00:06:56.449> power

00:06:56.649 --> 00:06:56.659 
position being that it does have power

00:06:56.659 --> 00:06:58.950 
position being that it does have power
steering<00:06:56.810> now<00:06:57.169> there<00:06:57.349> are<00:06:57.469> applications<00:06:58.279> that

00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.960 
steering now there are applications that

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.379 
steering now there are applications that
may<00:06:59.960> need<00:07:00.139> it<00:07:00.319> a<00:07:00.500> different<00:07:01.219> direction<00:07:01.389> also

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:02.389 
may need it a different direction also

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:05.219 
may need it a different direction also
it's<00:07:02.629> important<00:07:03.080> to<00:07:03.289> mention<00:07:03.469> that<00:07:03.800> the<00:07:04.250> prop

00:07:05.219 --> 00:07:05.229 
it's important to mention that the prop

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:08.379 
it's important to mention that the prop
in<00:07:06.229> some<00:07:06.529> cases<00:07:07.039> may<00:07:07.430> be<00:07:07.490> too<00:07:07.729> large<00:07:07.939> for<00:07:08.090> the

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:08.389 
in some cases may be too large for the

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:10.119 
in some cases may be too large for the
trim<00:07:08.599> tab<00:07:08.779> a<00:07:08.960> node<00:07:09.139> so<00:07:09.650> you<00:07:09.710> may<00:07:09.860> have<00:07:09.979> to

00:07:10.119 --> 00:07:10.129 
trim tab a node so you may have to

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:12.490 
trim tab a node so you may have to
actually<00:07:10.460> modify<00:07:10.909> it<00:07:11.090> and<00:07:11.360> cut<00:07:11.840> it<00:07:11.870> or<00:07:12.169> you

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:12.500 
actually modify it and cut it or you

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.950 
actually modify it and cut it or you
could<00:07:12.620> actually<00:07:12.770> get<00:07:13.580> the<00:07:13.729> flat<00:07:14.270> trim<00:07:14.599> tab<00:07:14.810> a

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:14.960 
could actually get the flat trim tab a

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.100 
could actually get the flat trim tab a
node<00:07:15.849> next<00:07:16.849> we<00:07:17.060> just<00:07:17.210> want<00:07:17.330> to<00:07:17.389> reattach<00:07:17.629> the

node next we just want to reattach the

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:22.839
