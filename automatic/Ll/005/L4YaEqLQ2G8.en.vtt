00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.730
 of comfort who does not like and as usual was not tumultuous traffic 

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:08.750
 means having an automatic or automated 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.660
 one of the most recent releases in this area is in the lap of the force area 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:14.750
 when the ball stops 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.570
 everyone is late is what is success is success 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.910
 the successor of showbol of the saints by 3 to 2 on the Flemish 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:26.800
 it is cheaper than the automatic changes of more weight 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.550
 until it becomes a fluvial port of s 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.579
 the fund is the same as the crisis 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:33.390
 What is called love? 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.600
 is a 5-speed manual gearbox with clutch 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.810
 which has an electronic module that makes the exchanges automatically 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.480
 the best of you in the field 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.460
 is that in automatic avenge mode it saves fuel when compared 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.750
 to conventional 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.320
 Why do quotas occur at the correct time? 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.120
 and does not interfere in performance so do not steal by 3 to 0 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.900
 but we are quiet during the changes as 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.810
 few have facilitated this characteristic with more 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.280
 short on the second 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.490
 3rd in fourth gear 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.340
 more sporty 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.850
 all decrease when using the option of the sport in which casualties are 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.260
 stretched and exchanges made faster 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.720
 only consumption 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.790
 or the option in the goal 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.790
 and there may be an iab card after the test 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.909
 as the set made only eight pounds more than the conventional 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.380
 the performance is practically the same as the normal paulo 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.010
 there is only a small loss but accelerations and resumption on account of 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.320
 smoothness of system action 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.420
 in consumption 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.659
 always difficult 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.490
 in our defense segment 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.840
 it's true hometown of roads 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.970
 according to the averages of September to two kilometers per liter of alcohol 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.650
 in February three kilometers from the center of brasilia 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.270
 another characteristic unchanged is the more comfortable behavior 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.530
 makes curves very well thanks to a suspension of 10 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.670
 a bit with the future open internal space and caused a lot of noise 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.129
 Overall finish and correct grips help lessen the problem 

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:22.289
 in the safety issue not to lose the custom in the middle of the little back seat 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:25.749
 head support the three-point belt 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:28.059
 with evolution that is worth it or not 

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:31.509
 for those who have two thousand and five hundred reais more at the time of 

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:32.619
 buy the point 

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:36.189
 and does not care what the riots during the gear changes 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:38.039
 it's a good 

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:40.160
 after all, an automated exchange 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.250
 besides comfort and economy 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.250
 It was a pleasure to drive the car 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:51.589
 and we sum up in a bowl that enem is not just my car 

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:53.969
 kate and kerry 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:55.279

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.249
 I'm going to stay there
