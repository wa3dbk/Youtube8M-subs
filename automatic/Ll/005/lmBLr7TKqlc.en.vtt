needlenose pliers and you know you can

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.400 
needlenose pliers and you know you can
just<00:01:24.759> individually<00:01:25.450> go<00:01:25.660> through<00:01:25.899> these<00:01:26.050> and

00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:31.679 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:34.469 

once<00:01:32.679> you<00:01:32.830> have<00:01:33.039> all<00:01:33.280> these<00:01:33.520> tabs<00:01:33.940> released

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
just flip it over and you can just push

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:49.770 
just flip it over and you can just push
it<00:01:39.280> out

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.030 

what<00:01:50.780> you<00:01:50.900> want<00:01:51.080> to<00:01:51.140> do<00:01:51.260> with<00:01:51.410> this<00:01:51.530> stainless

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
what you want to do with this stainless

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:59.130 
what you want to do with this stainless
steel<00:01:52.280> is<00:01:52.520> lay<00:01:53.300> it<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.950> front<00:01:55.340> side<00:01:55.610> down<00:01:58.090> and

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
steel is lay it the front side down and

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.660 
steel is lay it the front side down and
that<00:02:00.140> allows<00:02:00.500> us<00:02:00.530> to<00:02:00.830> get<00:02:01.190> a<00:02:01.370> good<00:02:01.610> trace<00:02:02.150> of

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
that allows us to get a good trace of

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:20.080 
that allows us to get a good trace of
these<00:02:04.670> size

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.610 

here<00:02:21.090> as<00:02:21.360> you<00:02:21.390> can<00:02:21.720> see<00:02:21.900> we<00:02:22.140> have<00:02:22.319> the

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
here as you can see we have the

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.670 
here as you can see we have the
completed<00:02:23.610> rough<00:02:24.000> cut<00:02:24.299> and<00:02:24.680> obviously

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
completed rough cut and obviously

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.880 
completed rough cut and obviously
there's<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.040> lot<00:02:26.220> of<00:02:26.489> excess<00:02:27.470> acrylic<00:02:28.470> on<00:02:28.620> here

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
there's a lot of excess acrylic on here

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.500 
there's a lot of excess acrylic on here
but<00:02:29.069> we're<00:02:29.250> we<00:02:29.519> have<00:02:29.549> this<00:02:29.879> sanding<00:02:30.299> block

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
but we're we have this sanding block

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
but we're we have this sanding block
here<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.110> additional<00:02:31.799> sandpaper<00:02:32.340> that

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
here and additional sandpaper that

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.410 
here and additional sandpaper that
wasn't<00:02:34.530> supposed<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:34.890> happen<00:02:35.040> but<00:02:35.489> we<00:02:36.239> can

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
wasn't supposed to happen but we can

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.240 
wasn't supposed to happen but we can
sand<00:02:36.780> down<00:02:36.900> all<00:02:37.379> these<00:02:37.680> rough<00:02:37.980> edges<00:02:38.220> here<00:02:40.250> so

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
sand down all these rough edges here so

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.100 
sand down all these rough edges here so
we'll<00:02:41.549> just<00:02:41.579> take<00:02:41.909> our<00:02:42.090> sandpaper<00:02:42.690> or<00:02:43.019> a

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
we'll just take our sandpaper or a

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.160 
we'll just take our sandpaper or a
sanding<00:02:43.260> block<00:02:43.970> I'd<00:02:44.970> recommend<00:02:45.629> just<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.989> use

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
sanding block I'd recommend just to use

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.380 
sanding block I'd recommend just to use
something<00:02:46.590> that's<00:02:46.709> fine<00:02:47.040> not<00:02:47.970> something

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
something that's fine not something

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.229 
something that's fine not something
that's<00:02:48.480> too<00:02:48.750> chorus<00:02:49.670> smooths<00:02:50.670> everything<00:02:50.790> out

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
that's too chorus smooths everything out

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:59.210 
that's too chorus smooths everything out
so<00:02:56.690> that's<00:02:57.690> about<00:02:57.870> it<00:02:57.959> just<00:02:58.590> clean<00:02:58.920> up<00:02:58.950> these

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
so that's about it just clean up these

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.650 
so that's about it just clean up these
edges<00:02:59.459> some<00:02:59.849> more<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:00.180> can<00:03:00.390> use<00:03:00.420> your<00:03:00.660> fingers

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
edges some more you can use your fingers

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.800 
edges some more you can use your fingers
and<00:03:04.730> we're<00:03:05.730> going<00:03:05.879> to<00:03:05.940> be<00:03:06.060> I<00:03:06.329> think<00:03:06.480> we're

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
and we're going to be I think we're

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.190

on<00:04:19.100> top<00:04:19.310> of<00:04:19.370> there<00:04:19.610> tape<00:04:20.120> it<00:04:20.299> on<00:04:20.450> make<00:04:21.110> sure

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
on top of there tape it on make sure

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.350 
on top of there tape it on make sure
everything's<00:04:21.680> steady<00:04:21.980> and<00:04:22.790> you<00:04:22.850> just<00:04:23.060> take<00:04:23.240> an

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
everything's steady and you just take an

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.480 
everything's steady and you just take an
exacto<00:04:23.840> knife<00:04:24.050> and<00:04:24.260> trace<00:04:25.220> out<00:04:25.520> the<00:04:25.760> lettering

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
exacto knife and trace out the lettering

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.880 
exacto knife and trace out the lettering
and<00:04:28.490> that's<00:04:28.730> about<00:04:28.910> it<00:04:29.180> so<00:04:30.110> it<00:04:30.290> leaves<00:04:30.530> the

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
and that's about it so it leaves the

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.090 
and that's about it so it leaves the
acrylic<00:04:31.430> clear<00:04:32.140> now<00:04:33.140> if<00:04:33.440> you<00:04:33.590> apply<00:04:33.710> too<00:04:33.950> much

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
acrylic clear now if you apply too much

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.900 
acrylic clear now if you apply too much
pressure<00:04:34.460> it<00:04:34.820> will<00:04:35.060> cut<00:04:35.450> the<00:04:35.630> acrylic<00:04:35.810> so<00:04:36.910> if

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
pressure it will cut the acrylic so if

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.210 
pressure it will cut the acrylic so if
you<00:04:38.090> prefer<00:04:38.540> you<00:04:38.750> can<00:04:38.930> actually<00:04:39.080> just<00:04:39.410> put<00:04:40.130> the

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
you prefer you can actually just put the

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.790 
you prefer you can actually just put the
template<00:04:40.640> on<00:04:40.850> the<00:04:41.180> vinyl<00:04:41.540> wrap<00:04:41.870> cut<00:04:42.560> it<00:04:42.650> out

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
template on the vinyl wrap cut it out

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.420 
template on the vinyl wrap cut it out
and<00:04:43.130> then<00:04:43.340> apply<00:04:43.580> the<00:04:43.820> vinyl<00:04:44.270> wrap<00:04:44.420> I<00:04:45.220> did<00:04:46.220> that

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
and then apply the vinyl wrap I did that

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.160 
and then apply the vinyl wrap I did that
it's<00:04:47.240> a<00:04:47.360> little<00:04:47.510> bit<00:04:47.600> easier<00:04:47.900> if<00:04:48.020> you<00:04:48.140> just

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
it's a little bit easier if you just

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.170 
it's a little bit easier if you just
take<00:04:48.680> this<00:04:48.920> right<00:04:49.160> onto<00:04:49.310> the<00:04:49.490> door<00:04:49.700> still<00:04:49.970> and

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
take this right onto the door still and

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.350 
take this right onto the door still and
do<00:04:50.540> it<00:04:50.660> like<00:04:50.780> that<00:04:51.850> but<00:04:52.850> it<00:04:53.000> doesn't<00:04:53.030> really

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
do it like that but it doesn't really

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.750 
do it like that but it doesn't really
matter<00:04:53.630> it<00:04:53.900> leaves<00:04:54.140> this<00:04:54.350> part<00:04:54.770> clear<00:04:54.950> and<00:04:55.370> all

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
matter it leaves this part clear and all

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.459 
matter it leaves this part clear and all
the<00:04:55.940> black

00:04:57.459 --> 00:04:57.469 
the black

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:59.290 
the black
carbon-fiber<00:04:58.069> blocks<00:04:58.519> out<00:04:58.789> all<00:04:58.819> the<00:04:59.119> other

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
carbon-fiber blocks out all the other

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.309 
carbon-fiber blocks out all the other
light<00:05:00.550> so<00:05:01.550> then<00:05:01.729> we<00:05:01.909> use<00:05:02.209> a<00:05:02.449> paper-thin<00:05:02.899> white

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:03.319 
light so then we use a paper-thin white

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:04.959 
light so then we use a paper-thin white

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:43.149 
going to allow the letterings here it
won't<00:05:41.269> be<00:05:41.569> able<00:05:41.719> to<00:05:41.869> peel<00:05:42.169> up<00:05:42.349> after<00:05:42.679> you<00:05:42.800> spray

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:43.159 
won't be able to peel up after you spray

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:44.679 
won't be able to peel up after you spray
the<00:05:43.279> clear<00:05:43.489> coat<00:05:43.699> on<00:05:43.729> so<00:05:44.089> basically<00:05:44.269> it's<00:05:44.629> just

00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:44.689 
the clear coat on so basically it's just

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:47.139 
the clear coat on so basically it's just
going<00:05:44.809> to<00:05:44.929> give<00:05:45.079> it<00:05:45.199> a<00:05:45.259> better<00:05:45.379> seal<00:05:45.769> and<00:05:46.149> the

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:47.149 
going to give it a better seal and the

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:49.749 
going to give it a better seal and the
durability<00:05:47.809> so<00:05:48.110> when<00:05:48.379> you<00:05:48.589> throw<00:05:49.459> up<00:05:49.489> your

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 
durability so when you throw up your

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:51.549 
durability so when you throw up your
shoes<00:05:50.089> on<00:05:50.300> here<00:05:50.599> and<00:05:50.749> stuff<00:05:50.959> like<00:05:51.110> that<00:05:51.319> the

00:05:51.549 --> 00:05:51.559 
shoes on here and stuff like that the

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:53.319 
shoes on here and stuff like that the
vinyl<00:05:51.769> definitely<00:05:52.369> won't<00:05:52.519> get<00:05:52.729> messed<00:05:52.969> up<00:05:53.149> or

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:53.329 
vinyl definitely won't get messed up or

00:05:53.329 --> 00:05:55.209 
vinyl definitely won't get messed up or
anything<00:05:53.659> and<00:05:53.869> you<00:05:54.739> just<00:05:54.800> want<00:05:55.009> to<00:05:55.069> do

00:05:55.209 --> 00:05:55.219 
anything and you just want to do

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:58.779 
anything and you just want to do
probably<00:05:56.179> four<00:05:56.809> coats<00:05:57.139> of<00:05:57.319> this<00:05:57.489> four<00:05:58.489> or<00:05:58.610> five

00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:58.789 
probably four coats of this four or five

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:11.160 
probably four coats of this four or five
coats<00:05:59.089> of<00:05:59.300> the<00:05:59.419> clear<00:05:59.869> coat

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.170 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.830 

we'll<00:06:12.170> just<00:06:12.320> take<00:06:12.530> our<00:06:13.270> wire<00:06:14.270> for<00:06:14.570> our<00:06:14.630> door

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 
we'll just take our wire for our door

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.610 
we'll just take our wire for our door
still<00:06:15.200> and<00:06:15.470> pull<00:06:15.620> it<00:06:15.740> through<00:06:15.770> and<00:06:17.470> now<00:06:18.470> you

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.620 
still and pull it through and now you

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.520 
still and pull it through and now you
can<00:06:18.800> see<00:06:19.040> the<00:06:19.550> door<00:06:19.790> still<00:06:20.120> is<00:06:20.780> wired<00:06:21.140> to<00:06:21.290> the

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
can see the door still is wired to the

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.500 
can see the door still is wired to the
inside<00:06:21.950> of<00:06:22.100> the<00:06:22.160> car<00:06:22.370> without<00:06:22.910> drilling<00:06:23.210> any

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:23.510 
inside of the car without drilling any

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.590 
inside of the car without drilling any
holes<00:06:23.890> and<00:06:25.120> you<00:06:26.120> know<00:06:26.210> if<00:06:26.360> you<00:06:26.450> have<00:06:26.540> a

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:26.600 
holes and you know if you have a

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.450 
holes and you know if you have a
different<00:06:27.020> maker<00:06:27.260> model<00:06:27.770> you<00:06:27.920> might<00:06:28.130> need<00:06:28.340> to

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 
different maker model you might need to

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.000 
different maker model you might need to
do<00:06:28.640> holes<00:06:28.940> within<00:06:29.270> these<00:06:29.570> two<00:06:29.750> pieces<00:06:29.990> but<00:06:30.740> the

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.010 
do holes within these two pieces but the

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.820 
do holes within these two pieces but the
acura<00:06:31.570> tsx<00:06:32.570> s<00:06:32.960> actually<00:06:33.350> made<00:06:33.500> it<00:06:33.590> really<00:06:33.710> easy

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
acura tsx s actually made it really easy

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.530 
acura tsx s actually made it really easy
you<00:06:34.250> don't<00:06:34.340> have<00:06:34.460> to<00:06:34.610> drill<00:06:34.790> any<00:06:34.910> holes<00:06:35.030> at<00:06:35.420> all

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:35.540 
you don't have to drill any holes at all

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.050 
you don't have to drill any holes at all
so<00:06:36.350> you<00:06:36.410> just<00:06:36.650> pull<00:06:36.920> this<00:06:37.070> back<00:06:37.130> and<00:06:37.610> you<00:06:37.670> want

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.060 
so you just pull this back and you want

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.760 
so you just pull this back and you want
to<00:06:38.120> make<00:06:38.210> sure<00:06:38.240> that<00:06:38.540> the<00:06:38.780> wire<00:06:39.230> gets<00:06:39.440> caught

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:39.770 
to make sure that the wire gets caught

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.140 
to make sure that the wire gets caught
behind<00:06:40.280> this<00:06:40.550> tab

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150 
behind this tab

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.720 
behind this tab
that<00:06:42.020> way<00:06:42.200> you'll<00:06:42.380> try<00:06:42.590> to<00:06:42.620> be<00:06:42.830> as<00:06:43.040> flush<00:06:43.430> as

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:43.730 
that way you'll try to be as flush as

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:49.690 
that way you'll try to be as flush as
possible<00:06:45.970> and<00:06:47.080> then<00:06:48.100> the<00:06:49.100> door<00:06:49.310> still<00:06:49.520> just

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:49.700 
possible and then the door still just

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.110 
possible and then the door still just
clips<00:06:50.030> into<00:06:50.210> place

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.909 

make<00:06:53.510> sure<00:06:53.720> everything<00:06:54.199> is<00:06:54.290> down

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 
make sure everything is down

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:58.219 
make sure everything is down
and<00:06:56.009> your<00:06:56.490> last<00:06:56.729> step<00:06:56.969> is<00:06:57.180> just<00:06:57.360> to<00:06:57.659> wire<00:06:57.960> this

00:06:58.219 --> 00:06:58.229 
and your last step is just to wire this

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:01.489 
and your last step is just to wire this
into<00:06:58.710> your<00:06:58.830> dome<00:06:59.039> light<00:06:59.659> you<00:07:00.659> could<00:07:00.840> you<00:07:01.409> know

00:07:01.489 --> 00:07:01.499 
into your dome light you could you know

00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:03.050 
into your dome light you could you know
every<00:07:01.889> car<00:07:02.099> is<00:07:02.219> going<00:07:02.310> to<00:07:02.370> be<00:07:02.430> different<00:07:02.699> so<00:07:03.030> I

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.060 
every car is going to be different so I

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:08.000 
every car is going to be different so I
won't<00:07:03.300> show<00:07:03.389> you<00:07:03.539> guys<00:07:03.719> that<00:07:03.930> step

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.010 

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.860 

this<00:07:09.010> is<00:07:09.250> the<00:07:09.490> final<00:07:09.910> result<00:07:10.300> of<00:07:10.480> the<00:07:10.630> door

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:10.870 
this is the final result of the door

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.070 
this is the final result of the door
stills<00:07:11.200> and<00:07:11.820> the<00:07:12.820> whole<00:07:13.030> project<00:07:13.330> took<00:07:13.870> about

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 
stills and the whole project took about

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.340 
stills and the whole project took about
a<00:07:14.680> month<00:07:14.950> long<00:07:15.340> and<00:07:15.700> that<00:07:16.420> was<00:07:16.630> mostly<00:07:17.080> waiting

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:17.350 
a month long and that was mostly waiting

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.070 
a month long and that was mostly waiting
on<00:07:17.620> parts<00:07:17.860> and<00:07:18.160> everything<00:07:18.400> to<00:07:18.700> dry<00:07:18.940> and<00:07:19.270> cure

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:20.080 
on parts and everything to dry and cure

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.140 
on parts and everything to dry and cure
again<00:07:20.740> the<00:07:20.890> vinyl<00:07:21.280> we<00:07:21.430> had<00:07:21.580> to<00:07:21.700> wait<00:07:21.820> for<00:07:22.000> that

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:22.150 
again the vinyl we had to wait for that

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:26.420 
again the vinyl we had to wait for that
to<00:07:22.300> dry<00:07:22.330> and<00:07:22.900> the<00:07:23.830> clear<00:07:24.280> coat<00:07:24.580> paint<00:07:25.060> all<00:07:25.300> that

go ahead and show you the passenger side

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.200 
go ahead and show you the passenger side
they're<00:07:30.040> both<00:07:30.220> the<00:07:30.400> same<00:07:30.610> but<00:07:30.640> I'll<00:07:31.000> show<00:07:31.180> you

the<00:07:36.630> total<00:07:37.020> cost<00:07:37.320> for<00:07:37.530> the<00:07:37.680> project<00:07:37.980> was<00:07:38.340> about

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:38.550 
the total cost for the project was about

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.540 
the total cost for the project was about
40<00:07:38.940> bucks<00:07:39.350> which<00:07:40.350> is<00:07:40.380> relatively<00:07:40.980> cheap<00:07:41.130> and

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:41.550 
40 bucks which is relatively cheap and
