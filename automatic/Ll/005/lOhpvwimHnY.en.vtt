with the juice and chard Mendenhall and
early<00:05:39.400> as<00:05:39.490> being<00:05:39.700> all<00:05:39.910> those<00:05:40.060> people<00:05:40.330> who<00:05:40.420> have

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:40.540 
early as being all those people who have

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.010 
early as being all those people who have
been<00:05:40.570> talked<00:05:40.870> about<00:05:40.990> but<00:05:42.540> regarding<00:05:43.540> Iowa

been talked about but regarding Iowa

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.360 
been talked about but regarding Iowa
obviously<00:05:44.500> they<00:05:44.590> don't<00:05:44.680> have<00:05:44.920> that<00:05:45.100> sort<00:05:45.250> of

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
obviously they don't have that sort of

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:46.560 
obviously they don't have that sort of
offense<00:05:45.760> they<00:05:45.880> don't<00:05:46.030> have<00:05:46.150> those<00:05:46.300> type<00:05:46.540> of

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
offense they don't have those type of

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.100 
offense they don't have those type of
weapons<00:05:47.020> and<00:05:47.430> she's<00:05:48.430> bad<00:05:48.730> offense<00:05:49.300> I<00:05:49.570> don't

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
weapons and she's bad offense I don't

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.690 
weapons and she's bad offense I don't
think<00:05:50.290> you<00:05:50.470> know<00:05:50.560> it<00:05:51.010> sort<00:05:51.190> of<00:05:51.220> spoke<00:05:51.460> for

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:51.700 
think you know it sort of spoke for

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.130 
think you know it sort of spoke for
itself<00:05:51.730> i<00:05:52.060> think<00:05:52.090> was<00:05:52.330> writing<00:05:52.630> into<00:05:52.840> the<00:05:52.930> game

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:53.140 
itself i think was writing into the game

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.230 
itself i think was writing into the game
and<00:05:54.100> so<00:05:54.490> i<00:05:54.520> think<00:05:54.580> it<00:05:54.760> was<00:05:54.820> a<00:05:54.910> really<00:05:55.060> nice

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
and so i think it was a really nice

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.960 
and so i think it was a really nice
combination<00:05:55.990> of<00:05:56.110> pretty<00:05:56.980> pretty<00:05:57.310> bad<00:05:57.550> offense

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970 
combination of pretty pretty bad offense

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.020 
combination of pretty pretty bad offense
pretty<00:05:58.510> good<00:05:58.690> defense<00:05:58.900> and<00:05:59.260> that<00:05:59.440> sort<00:05:59.740> of<00:06:00.030> the

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
pretty good defense and that sort of the

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.120 
pretty good defense and that sort of the
equation<00:06:01.450> of<00:06:01.540> the<00:06:01.690> words<00:06:01.930> that<00:06:02.020> Kevin<00:06:03.010> I<00:06:03.100> I

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 
equation of the words that Kevin I I

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.620

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:06.820 
even when Penn State didn't blitz by

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.220 
even when Penn State didn't blitz by
just<00:06:07.030> how<00:06:07.180> much<00:06:07.330> pressure<00:06:07.630> they<00:06:07.840> got<00:06:08.020> from

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:08.230 
just how much pressure they got from

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:09.780 
just how much pressure they got from
their<00:06:08.350> defensive<00:06:08.890> lineman<00:06:09.280> I<00:06:09.340> mean<00:06:09.490> what<00:06:09.670> can

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:09.790 
their defensive lineman I mean what can

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380 
be attributed that to just how much

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.770 
be attributed that to just how much
success<00:06:11.650> the<00:06:12.370> d-line<00:06:12.730> have<00:06:12.970> against<00:06:13.390> Iowa
