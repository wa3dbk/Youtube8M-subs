00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.250
 i 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.360
 ah 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.760
 yes 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.140
 to 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.660
 m 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.790
 very good to all players here 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.070
 we are in a new video and in this 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.050
 once we have the eighth dungeon of 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.780
 cold that would be the last to finish 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.820
 fried we are here in the hive of the 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.649
 greedy test that would be a dungeon that 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.350
 is recommended for level characters 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.570
 109 in tomás and it's the dungeon 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.329
 difficult to cold of all that 's why 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.360
 last one and when passing this one we will be able to pass to 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:04.059
 cold stress and fight against the 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.649
 most feared monsters of all cold well 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.149
 to enter the dungeon we will only have 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:09.340
 have to talk to the guardian and enter 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:11.140
 this corridor here and we'll enter the 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.630
 antechamber of the sweet tooth that would be the 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.369
 Default dungeon the ruby colossus 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.110
 that is a monster that will give us a lot 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.420
 true that only changes if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.670
 and it has enough resistance to 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.649
 intelligence and nothing else the colossus you 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.570
 has a status that if we take it away from him 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.490
 to give pm to all enemies like this 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.770
 to be careful with this color 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.320
 half I think it's the hardest enemy 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.060
 the most complicated since there is a thousand damages 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.530
 by pushing each time we hit him and if 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.750
 catches us against a wall can we 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.420
 kill practically in a turn so 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.060
 is very careful the colossus foxes was a 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.500
 monster 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.600
 more or less normal does not have much that 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.229
 say and good will have weakness to the fire 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.630
 and it is one of the most common of these 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.549
 bugs what the and honey will be a 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.350
 species was credited as they intercepted 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.210
 the damage but will also give vitality to 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.860
 almost all enemies so good 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.140
 they can also be annoying but not 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.600
 they are usually in abundance in the last 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.460
 room the color swim is an enemy that 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.890
 It attracts online that you are going to see the effect 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.989
 In the last room it cool to Asia 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.640
 pass all these rooms in we will enter 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.590
 here to the chambers of the throne colossus 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.230
 real that would be the last room and where 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.569
 be with us in real well I'll 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.569
 explain how to take away the vulnerability 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:23.120
 and everything that we should not do to 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:26.090
 is in this room is worth how we go 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.190
 the others start by removing some 550 more 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.190
 or less and as we go down 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.319
 of life will be removing more image the 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.480
 strategy would kill the color met that 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.880
 it would be the one that has the damage by pushing 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.780
 and I always recommend trying 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.690
 kill that good 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.750
 and we can not be pushed real 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.640
 we can remove ppm or take away 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.160
 reach worth here was plagued with the 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.440
 And I could not push him because if he was not going 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.970
 to enter the state as your reaction and 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.819
 this state the only thing that does is that 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.250
 when an enemy dies, the colossus swirls 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.140
 to relive it so it's practically 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.080
 almost impossible to kill with this state 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.760
 active and that does not push good here 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.160
 we see the state of the swim color that would be 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.450
 the one that when we hit him when he has a 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.830
 certain state because it will bring us in 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.140
 line to all players game 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.280
 enemies that are in line with the color 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.240
 nothing 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.190
 and we should not push him 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.290
 we should take away PM and we should not 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.540
 take it out and you'll see 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.430
 below how to remove the 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.129
 vulnerability 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.590
 I recommend again to kill the volume 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:35.280
 and maybe the color nothing can be something 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.140
 annoying because if we attract that 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.420
 we hit the goal hornado and the greedy 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.690
 Real throne is in line with 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.430
 with the color swim, we're going to 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.890
 move and that's what we do not have to 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.390
 we can not push or push 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.989
 displace him neither an attraction and a 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.910
 liberation nothing is worth it so that's why 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.590
 we can hit the color swimming having 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.720
 something the others in line with him so 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.090
 be very careful with this detail too 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.150
 we have here and good as we have here 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.530
 the scammer who was with ya in it 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.269
 Green is well let's see 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.100
 below how are we going to take away the 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.560
 vulnerability first we have to have 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.180
 four squares away behind 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.700
 ours and we'll just have to attack them 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.060
 glued to him worth body body we with 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.650
 weapon or spell when hit will push us 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.169
 four boxes and since then 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.060
 we can keep hitting only the turn 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.760
 of the character that has removed him in the 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.500
 vulnerability that turn how are we going 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.090
 see below the panda of her then 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.979
 is going to approach and there will be a fist 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.389
 Flamígero is going to push him four 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:36.470
 boxes back and you will be able to 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:38.480
 hit him that is very important 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.660
 we always have those four boxes of 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.430
 back because if we have three or two if 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.140
 we hit a wall we're going to die 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.840
 instantly so that yes there is also 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.580
 have to be very careful and also 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.010
 you have to be careful because there will be good 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.540
 more you will see what not to do 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.370
 since I already wanted to do a demonstration 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.100
 as we see here I put the sacrum in 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.960
 line with the color swim with the boss other 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.080
 in real forgiveness and I was online and the 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.340
 lucena and as we see the sacrum was 22 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.740
 squares away from the wall and the 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.480
 crash because he died instantly and 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.070
 now how are you going to see your precious 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.350
 little message that is going to come out down there 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.670
 in the normal chat he will tell us that 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.520
 this is what we do not have to do 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:19.070
 that you do not do it and a heart but good 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.020
 is what we should not have to have 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:24.050
 characters online or have us 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.580
 same online not to be us 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.410
 same in line with the throne colossus 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.360
 real since as we see here it's going to 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.480
 push four squares and it's going to be a 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.130
 little bit annoying that can kill us 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.630
 that's how it's worth so much 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.640
 be careful with our we will not have either 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.650
 to move or anything like that because if 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.910
 not as I say to go into goal or his 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.360
 reaction and if it comes 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:47.880
 to all the enemies we had killed 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:50.760
 and good as you know the dungeons 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.740
 next would be those of seal art good 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.210
 here teach that we already see that every time 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.930
 that is going down life is going to remove 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:59.790
 more and here since 1900 and all that and 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.640
 well the most recent ones are those of 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.380
 hitler clean and there they freeze me that 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.420
 would be the four necessary to be able 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.580
 move on with back against 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.890
 well here before anything else we already see that 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.240
 he hesitated a little bit 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.180
 hit the team now compress that 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:18.030
 we ended up killing some other real 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.440
 you're dungeon four cold three 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.840
 they are quite difficult to try 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.150
 I will try to bring them and I can with him 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.580
 we will also try to do them all and 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:29.100
 obviously then I will try to come up with 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.620
 some day that since it's the dungeon more 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.840
 difficult of all because that is supposed or 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:36.389
 at least cold 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.820
 but well here we had finished the 

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:41.130
 dungeon and then there would not be much more 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.570
 to tell so good I hope that 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:44.240
 you liked the video if you have 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:46.710
 any doubt you put it down there 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.210
 online never fine anything else subscribe if 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:52.460
 you have not done it yet and as I say 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:52.460
 always thank you very much and see you soon
