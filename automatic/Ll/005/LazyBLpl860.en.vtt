one doesn't so what we're doing just to
prevent<00:00:19.350> slippage<00:00:19.830> if<00:00:20.070> you're<00:00:20.279> trying<00:00:20.520> on<00:00:20.640> a

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960

some backing some monofilament backing
and<00:00:23.640> then<00:00:23.789> we're<00:00:23.880> going<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.029> tie<00:00:24.240> our<00:00:24.390> braid<00:00:24.660> on

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
and then we're going to tie our braid on

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.230 
and then we're going to tie our braid on
to<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.830> then<00:00:25.920> spool<00:00:26.250> up<00:00:26.400> with<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:26.699> so

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
to that and then spool up with that so

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.640 
to that and then spool up with that so
I've<00:00:27.300> got<00:00:27.420> my<00:00:27.510> way<00:00:27.630> ways<00:00:27.869> over<00:00:28.080> here<00:00:28.380> he's

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
helping me pull this up it's pretty hard

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.820 
helping me pull this up it's pretty hard
to<00:00:30.210> spool<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.599> real<00:00:30.810> by<00:00:30.960> yourself<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:31.439> if<00:00:31.710> it

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
to spool a real by yourself so if it

to spool a real by yourself so if it
doesn't<00:00:31.980> make<00:00:32.160> me<00:00:32.309> help<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.550> out<00:00:32.700> if<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.480> can

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
doesn't make me help you out if you can

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.420 
doesn't make me help you out if you can
I<00:00:33.660> put<00:00:33.809> 20<00:00:34.079> meters<00:00:34.350> or<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.190> light

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
I put 20 meters or so of this light

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.280 
I put 20 meters or so of this light
monofilament<00:00:36.210> line<00:00:36.600> on<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:36.870> little<00:00:37.050> real

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
monofilament line on this little real

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.430 
monofilament line on this little real
and<00:00:38.480> it's<00:00:39.480> just<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.750> matter<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:39.960> keeping<00:00:40.170> a

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
and it's just a matter of keeping a

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.950 
and it's just a matter of keeping a
fairly<00:00:41.160> even<00:00:41.489> tension<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.120> getting<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.780> nice

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
fairly even tension on it getting a nice

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.490 
fairly even tension on it getting a nice
smooth<00:00:44.390> covering<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.480> line<00:00:45.690> over<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.170> spool

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
smooth covering of line over the spool

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.560 
smooth covering of line over the spool
that's<00:00:46.950> probably<00:00:47.190> about<00:00:47.280> enough<00:00:47.670> so<00:00:48.360> where's

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
that's probably about enough so where's

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.439 
that's probably about enough so where's
we'll<00:00:48.690> just<00:00:48.870> cut<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.200> line<00:00:49.379> off<00:00:50.300> and<00:00:51.300> then

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
we'll just cut that line off and then

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.119 
we'll just cut that line off and then
what<00:00:51.600> we're<00:00:51.690> going<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.840> do<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.230> use<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.469> double

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
what we're going to do is use a double

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.240 
what we're going to do is use a double
uni<00:00:53.399> not<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:54.449> connect<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.320> monofilament

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
uni not to connect this monofilament

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.060 
uni not to connect this monofilament
backing<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.420> our<00:00:57.570> braided<00:00:57.989> line<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.530> then

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
backing to our braided line and then

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.920 
backing to our braided line and then
I'll<00:00:59.309> show<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.609> how<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.270> put<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.600> braided

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
I'll show you how to put the braided

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.869 
I'll show you how to put the braided
line<00:01:01.079> onto<00:01:01.289> your<00:01:01.500> reel<00:01:01.680> okay<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.550> we've<00:01:02.850> got

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
line onto your reel okay so we've got

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.509 
line onto your reel okay so we've got
our<00:01:03.000> mono<00:01:03.660> backing<00:01:04.140> on<00:01:04.260> now<00:01:04.470> where's<00:01:05.189> this<00:01:05.280> cut

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
our mono backing on now where's this cut

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.190 
our mono backing on now where's this cut
that<00:01:05.549> off<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.060> we've<00:01:06.240> connected<00:01:06.510> out<00:01:06.810> our

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
that off and we've connected out our

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.929 
that off and we've connected out our
brave<00:01:07.470> main<00:01:07.770> mile<00:01:08.040> on<00:01:08.220> with<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.430> double

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
brave main mile on with a double

brave main mile on with a double
unionize<00:01:09.360> which<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.930> can<00:01:10.080> see<00:01:10.229> elsewhere<00:01:10.470> on

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
unionize which you can see elsewhere on

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.740 
unionize which you can see elsewhere on
the<00:01:10.799> fish<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:10.979> world<00:01:11.220> web<00:01:11.369> site<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:12.299> now<00:01:12.450> we

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
the fish and world web site so now we

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.499 
the fish and world web site so now we
need<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:12.960> land<00:01:13.799> on<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.520> main<00:01:14.760> line<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.299> it's

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
need to land on the main line and it's

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.390 
need to land on the main line and it's
best<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.750> do<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.049> with<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.530> screwdriver<00:01:16.979> or<00:01:17.280> a

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
best to do that with a screwdriver or a

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.670 
best to do that with a screwdriver or a
pen<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.939> someone<00:01:18.810> holding<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.140> rag<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.590> can

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
pen and someone holding a rag so you can

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.010 
pen and someone holding a rag so you can
get<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.799> good<00:01:20.040> firm<00:01:20.369> even<00:01:20.759> pressure<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.900> your

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
get a good firm even pressure to your

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.020 
get a good firm even pressure to your
line<00:01:22.200> goes<00:01:22.470> on<00:01:22.590> really<00:01:22.830> evenly<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.610> put<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.880> on

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
line goes on really evenly you put it on

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.510 
line goes on really evenly you put it on
to<00:01:24.479> loosely<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.590> get<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.770> good<00:01:25.950> fish<00:01:26.250> it

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
to loosely and you get a good fish it

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.850 
to loosely and you get a good fish it
might<00:01:26.729> dig<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.450> snap<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.290> lose<00:01:28.500> you

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
might dig in and snap and you lose you

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.230 
might dig in and snap and you lose you
know<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.159> really<00:01:29.369> great<00:01:29.549> fish

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
know a really great fish

they put put your light on and a decent

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.100 
they put put your light on and a decent
sort<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.180> pressure<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.750> get<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.900> nice

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
sort of a pressure so you get a nice

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.670 
sort of a pressure so you get a nice
even<00:01:34.380> lay<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.520> line<00:01:35.759> along<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.450> real<00:01:36.680> these

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
even lay of line along the real these
