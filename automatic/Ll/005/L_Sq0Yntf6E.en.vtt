 Rougeau rock makeup was used for the 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.279
 first time in the 1925 Ben Hur film 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.980
 probably to make up quickly 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.810
 the body of the many extras in 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.670
 early eighties some makeup artists 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.769
 began to study the possibilities of 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.140
 graph trick with specific formulations 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.660
 both for professional makeup and for 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.800
 the personal one 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.020
 today the rho group makeup is the technique 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.870
 most sought after in high definition e 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.540
 in special effects 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.770
 the advantages of makeup and rho graph are is 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.420
 Invisible 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.309
 the application is so fine from 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.149
 be practically invisible if the 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:51.360
 right color is practically light 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.670
 intangible seems to have nothing e 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.390
 super covering suitable for any type 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.489
 of leather and long lasting it does not condense 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.010
 in wrinkles but lasts intact for hours and 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.820
 hours in some formulations and also 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.070
 waterproof is not transferable not 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.100
 stain clothes and surfaces 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.880
 and hygienic does not need sponges or 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.200
 brushes 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.240
 so there is no transfer or 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.740
 bacteria proliferation 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.920
 that's why it's ideal for those who suffer from 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:25.240
 acne or other skin diseases is accurate 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:30.970
 it fades by itself is hypoallergenic when 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:32.680
 water based how it works with the 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.570
 makeup airbrush technique comes 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.490
 micronized and sprayed on the skin in 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.170
 layers of tiny drops that 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.880
 cover with an effect comparable to 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.880
 that of the pixels of a photograph 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.000
 each airbrush kit is composed of a 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.119
 English airbrush often called 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.060
 stylus connected through a tube to a 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:56.160
 compressor used at low pressure 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.160
 typically six to twenty psi 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.520
 when we talk about many compressors 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.130
 think of noisy bulky machines 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.020
 but today thanks to technology and the 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.479
 made that the pressure needed for a 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.399
 use on the skin must be low e 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.380
 compressors are little bigger than a 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.269
 pack of cigarettes and have one 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:18.910
 more than enough power for the 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:21.370
 applications on face and airbrush body 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.000
 can be single-action with 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.829
 constant air flow or double action 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.079
 where it will be necessary to take on the lever 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:31.900
 to start the air flow before 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:33.850
 dispense the make up difference ai 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.510
 the purposes of makeup are minimal and little 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:40.180
 important then the airbrushes have 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.739
 a gravity-based diet where the 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.049
 color is introduced into a tank 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.360
 opposite on top or 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.040
 axes phone and where the liquid does 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.900
 located in a bottle that is aspirated 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.090
 from below 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.280
 the latter type is more convenient when you are 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.439
 they must color large surfaces such as 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.280
 in body painting in tanning for 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:58.720
 face makeup 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.510
 It will undoubtedly fi licata 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.250
 gravity feeding the makeup 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.370
 specifically formulated for the airbrush 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.220
 it is divided mainly into three types a 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.319
 silicone and water based base 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.970
 of alcohol 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.280
 the skin especially if tending to 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.189
 dry must be well hydrated before and 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.530
 the use of primer may be useful 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:23.109
 water based is the most hypoallergenic and 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.540
 it dries as soon as applied the one a 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:28.540
 silicone base is more mobile and soft 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.489
 but it is not universally tolerated 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.349
 lastly, alcohol-based makeup is that 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.709
 most used for body painting and yes 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:37.900
