00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.360
 greetings to all the users as well 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.600
 I just did him 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.879
 the water change 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.790
 a new aquarium and here is the closet 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:07.520
 and also it changes the water can 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.890
 see still a bit murky then what 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.009
 what are we going to do is go check 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.550
 also with you is the mixture that 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:18.710
 I did when installing the new support 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.400
 very little is about half a spoonful of 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.400
 have obvious 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.619
 and it's also going to be 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.219
 one half tablespoon of activated charcoal 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.219
 powdered 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.619
 until they see is a state being given 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.619
 because they already had a little bag 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:57.050
 and I already had something of dell stability 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.050
 that is a little more 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.470
 because deciding what coal does 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.650
 activated itself is clean 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.270
 you can see this in front of the bacteria 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.620
 to call the head and to order the 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.620
 active carbon powder 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.080
 Well, this is going to come back 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.780
 to 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.190
 then go straight to lift me 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.299
 I was not preceded by a consistency of 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:53.299
 Many 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.530
 ah 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.610
 now let's see how it acts and if 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.610
 it really works 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.819
 already this 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.549
 before with the old filter that I had in 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.709
 the neighborhood mainly because every time 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.049
 I changed the water with water 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:24.049
 tap that I was going to beat the 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:26.599
 shrimp and they get pretty crazy like 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.400
 can see right now they are calm I think 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.050
 which is more than anything because of the big filter 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.040
 that I have 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.870
 here you can see the canastero that 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.720
 keep bacteria more stable 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.420
 but still if you notice that the fish is a 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.780
 little your weight your samba just that they are 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.590
 a little more agitated as they apply 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.480
 bacterium 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.480
 and then when we see each other in our video 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.700
 and
