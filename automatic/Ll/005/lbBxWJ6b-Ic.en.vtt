00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
for fun and at that point in my life I

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.979

just wanted to play football
I<00:03:22.170> just<00:03:22.530> thought<00:03:22.829> football<00:03:23.639> was<00:03:23.850> the<00:03:24.239> only<00:03:24.720> way

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
I just thought football was the only way

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.440 
I just thought football was the only way
I<00:03:25.109> could<00:03:25.620> make<00:03:25.920> it<00:03:26.069> out<00:03:26.250> of<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.489> Township<00:03:26.910> you

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
I could make it out of the Township you

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.050 
I could make it out of the Township you
know<00:03:27.569> so<00:03:28.170> I<00:03:28.200> chose<00:03:28.590> football<00:03:29.069> over<00:03:29.280> my

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
know so I chose football over my

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.340 
know so I chose football over my
schooling<00:03:31.069> but<00:03:32.069> then<00:03:32.579> at<00:03:32.819> best<00:03:33.180> we<00:03:33.389> had<00:03:33.750> it's

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
schooling but then at best we had it's

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.220 
schooling but then at best we had it's
you<00:03:35.100> know<00:03:35.220> there's<00:03:35.609> a<00:03:35.959> collaboration<00:03:36.959> between

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
you know there's a collaboration between

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.349 
you know there's a collaboration between
football<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:37.859> school<00:03:38.190> so<00:03:38.760> I<00:03:38.790> was<00:03:39.030> getting<00:03:39.209> the

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
football and school so I was getting the

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.199 
football and school so I was getting the
post<00:03:39.540> of<00:03:39.690> both<00:03:40.200> worlds<00:03:40.799> so<00:03:41.370> I<00:03:41.400> just<00:03:41.639> chose<00:03:41.819> bed

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
post of both worlds so I just chose bed

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.449 
post of both worlds so I just chose bed
rest<00:03:42.420> at<00:03:42.660> that<00:03:42.720> age<00:03:43.109> they<00:03:43.829> gave<00:03:43.980> me<00:03:44.100> the<00:03:44.220> chance

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
rest at that age they gave me the chance

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.160 
rest at that age they gave me the chance
to<00:03:44.609> it's<00:03:45.000> I<00:03:45.239> did<00:03:45.510> I<00:03:45.660> did<00:03:45.900> it

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
to it's I did I did it

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.330 
to it's I did I did it
and<00:03:46.260> I<00:03:47.220> I<00:03:47.819> guess<00:03:48.150> it<00:03:48.299> got<00:03:48.690> me<00:03:48.840> here<00:03:49.049> so<00:03:49.380> it<00:03:50.190> was

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
and I I guess it got me here so it was

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.800 
and I I guess it got me here so it was
the<00:03:50.459> right<00:03:50.579> decision<00:03:50.730> to<00:03:51.060> make

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.870
