15 seconds we'll try to read me Jason to
to<00:02:07.500> number<00:02:07.740> three<00:02:08.630> and<00:02:09.630> let's<00:02:10.500> see<00:02:10.709> what<00:02:11.009> are

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
to number three and let's see what are

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:18.640 
to number three and let's see what are
we<00:02:11.340> going<00:02:11.549> to<00:02:11.850> get

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.150 

we<00:02:19.650> have<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:20.090> funky<00:02:21.090> proposal<00:02:21.780> now<00:02:22.560> let's<00:02:22.830> see

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
we have a funky proposal now let's see

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:48.030 
we have a funky proposal now let's see
what<00:02:23.790> correlation<00:02:24.630> is<00:02:24.750> going<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.440> do<00:02:25.620> for<00:02:25.890> us

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.050 

both<00:02:49.040> models<00:02:49.520> are<00:02:50.500> stitched<00:02:51.500> together<00:02:52.060> the

both models are stitched together the

both models are stitched together the
occlusion<00:02:53.570> and<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:54.200> preparation<00:02:54.800> looks<00:02:55.640> very

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
occlusion and the preparation looks very

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.720 
occlusion and the preparation looks very
nice<00:02:59.140> we're<00:03:00.140> gonna<00:03:00.260> go<00:03:00.530> through<00:03:00.800> every<00:03:01.340> single

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
nice we're gonna go through every single

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.900 
nice we're gonna go through every single
step<00:03:02.270> the<00:03:03.490> design<00:03:04.490> of<00:03:04.760> a<00:03:04.880> crown<00:03:06.760> starting<00:03:07.760> with

step the design of a crown starting with
the<00:03:08.030> margination<00:03:15.910> just<00:03:16.910> correct<00:03:17.270> some<00:03:17.780> areas

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.300 

looks<00:03:21.830> very<00:03:22.160> nice<00:03:23.140> let's<00:03:24.140> go<00:03:24.290> forward<00:03:24.560> next

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
looks very nice let's go forward next

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.920 
looks very nice let's go forward next
step<00:03:25.810> we're<00:03:26.810> gonna<00:03:27.220> get<00:03:28.220> as<00:03:28.670> much<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.660> data

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
step we're gonna get as much the data

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.260 
step we're gonna get as much the data
that<00:03:30.200> we<00:03:30.380> have<00:03:30.740> I'm<00:03:31.670> gonna<00:03:31.850> leave<00:03:32.120> it<00:03:32.240> here

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
that we have I'm gonna leave it here

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.570 
that we have I'm gonna leave it here
with<00:03:32.780> that<00:03:32.960> initial<00:03:33.470> proposal<00:03:34.040> and<00:03:34.130> see<00:03:34.340> what

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
with that initial proposal and see what

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.390 
with that initial proposal and see what
the<00:03:34.700> computer<00:03:34.880> is<00:03:35.120> gonna<00:03:35.210> give<00:03:35.480> us<00:03:35.980> it<00:03:36.980> was<00:03:37.160> a

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
the computer is gonna give us it was a

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.100 
the computer is gonna give us it was a
very<00:03:38.150> fair<00:03:38.710> proposal<00:03:39.790> good<00:03:40.790> occlusion<00:03:41.480> the

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
very fair proposal good occlusion the

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.950 
very fair proposal good occlusion the

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
occlusion looks nice almost exactly as

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.470

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.050 

here's<00:03:53.480> a<00:03:53.600> couple<00:03:53.840> tools<00:03:54.650> like<00:03:55.460> the<00:03:55.670> smooth

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
here's a couple tools like the smooth

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.310 
here's a couple tools like the smooth
tool<00:03:58.240> slightly<00:03:59.240> concavity<00:03:59.810> and<00:03:59.900> the<00:03:59.990> music

tool slightly concavity and the music

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.190 
tool slightly concavity and the music
will<00:04:00.410> just<00:04:00.680> add<00:04:00.860> some<00:04:01.070> portion<00:04:01.490> and<00:04:02.200> that's

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
will just add some portion and that's

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.360 
will just add some portion and that's
gonna<00:04:03.470> be<00:04:03.710> it

Foucault's<00:04:37.180> we<00:04:38.180> say<00:04:38.510> -<00:04:38.960> 30<00:04:39.680> spacer<00:04:40.520> so<00:04:41.360> the<00:04:41.510> fit

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
Foucault's we say - 30 spacer so the fit

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.940 
Foucault's we say - 30 spacer so the fit
was<00:04:41.960> great<00:04:43.210> we<00:04:44.210> have<00:04:44.360> no<00:04:44.600> binding<00:04:45.470> on<00:04:45.740> this

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
was great we have no binding on this

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.750 
was great we have no binding on this
preparation<00:04:46.400> so<00:04:47.020> as<00:04:48.020> you<00:04:48.230> can<00:04:48.380> see<00:04:48.640> it<00:04:49.640> looks

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
preparation so as you can see it looks

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.330 
preparation so as you can see it looks
really<00:04:50.000> nice<00:04:50.560> this<00:04:51.560> is<00:04:51.710> her<00:04:51.830> before<00:04:51.980> and
