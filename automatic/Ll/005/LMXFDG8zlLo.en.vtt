00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.030 

here's<00:00:01.979> a<00:00:02.070> good<00:00:02.399> trick<00:00:02.990> to<00:00:03.990> switch<00:00:04.470> between<00:00:04.650> D

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
here's a good trick to switch between D

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.789 
here's a good trick to switch between D
major<00:00:05.220> and<00:00:05.430> B<00:00:05.640> minor<00:00:06.029> so<00:00:06.779> these<00:00:07.109> two<00:00:07.290> chords<00:00:07.649> go

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
major and B minor so these two chords go

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.830 
major and B minor so these two chords go
well<00:00:07.950> together<00:00:08.870> D<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.110> B<00:00:10.260> minor<00:00:11.300> because<00:00:12.300> D

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
well together D and B minor because D

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.890 
well together D and B minor because D
majors<00:00:13.610> there<00:00:14.610> are<00:00:14.820> relative<00:00:15.420> major<00:00:15.630> and

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
majors there are relative major and

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.090 
majors there are relative major and
minor<00:00:16.080> chords<00:00:18.199> which<00:00:19.199> means<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.740> this<00:00:19.890> is

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
minor chords which means that this is

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.519 
minor chords which means that this is
the<00:00:20.130> one<00:00:20.430> chord<00:00:20.730> in<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.000> key<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.180> D<00:00:21.410> and<00:00:22.410> this

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
the one chord in the key of D and this

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.230 
the one chord in the key of D and this
is<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.859> sixth<00:00:23.130> chord<00:00:23.369> in<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.640> key<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.850> D<00:00:26.240> but

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
is the sixth chord in the key of D but

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.300 
is the sixth chord in the key of D but
really<00:00:27.539> what<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:27.750> partly<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.920> just<00:00:29.099> means

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
really what that partly it just means

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.710 
really what that partly it just means
that<00:00:29.460> bitch<00:00:29.760> they're<00:00:30.300> almost<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.689> same

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
that bitch they're almost the same

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.700 
that bitch they're almost the same
chords<00:00:31.349> because<00:00:32.160> if<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.430> look<00:00:32.579> at<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.940> like

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
chords because if you look at it like

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.420 
chords because if you look at it like
here's<00:00:34.710> D<00:00:34.920> now<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.610> change<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.710> single<00:00:37.710> note<00:00:37.890> to

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
here's D now I change the single note to

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.260 
here's D now I change the single note to
get<00:00:38.579> two<00:00:39.590> from<00:00:40.590> D<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.800> B<00:00:40.890> minor<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:42.090> there's

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
get two from D to B minor so there's

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.970 
get two from D to B minor so there's
lots<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.540> these<00:00:42.629> pairs<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:43.079> chords<00:00:43.379> like<00:00:43.500> C<00:00:43.829> and

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
lots of these pairs of chords like C and

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:51.670 
lots of these pairs of chords like C and
a<00:00:44.070> minor<00:00:44.719> or<00:00:45.719> G<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.230> E<00:00:46.350> minor<00:00:47.390> or<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.899> F<00:00:49.020> sure

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.740 

but<00:00:52.680> anyways<00:00:52.890> D<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.340> B<00:00:53.460> minor<00:00:53.699> sound<00:00:54.539> good

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
but anyways D and B minor sound good

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.799 
but anyways D and B minor sound good
together<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:56.030> here's<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.120> cool<00:00:57.300> trick<00:00:57.510> that

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
together so here's a cool trick that

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.090 
together so here's a cool trick that
I've<00:00:57.930> been<00:00:58.050> using<00:00:58.230> for<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.620> lot<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:59.100> lot<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.640> years

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
I've been using for a lot a lot of years

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.399 
I've been using for a lot a lot of years
you<00:01:02.100> can<00:01:02.250> play<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.399> d<00:01:02.640> here<00:01:03.049> and<00:01:04.049> then<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.260> can

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
you can play a d here and then you can

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.649 
you can play a d here and then you can
move<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.619> up<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.890> here<00:01:05.510> this<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:07.110> open<00:01:07.890> string

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
move it up to here this is a open string

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.820 
move it up to here this is a open string
so<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.720> can<00:01:09.869> hit<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.080> other<00:01:10.200> string<00:01:10.500> on<00:01:10.619> both

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
so you can hit the other string on both

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.140 
so you can hit the other string on both
like

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
like

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.290 
like
you<00:01:14.150> can<00:01:14.330> go<00:01:14.480> up<00:01:14.540> here<00:01:14.600> so<00:01:14.840> zero<00:01:15.580> seven<00:01:16.580> seven

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
you can go up here so zero seven seven

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.560 
you can go up here so zero seven seven
five<00:01:17.770> this<00:01:18.770> is<00:01:18.950> just<00:01:19.160> the<00:01:19.280> next<00:01:19.490> voicing<00:01:20.240> of<00:01:20.390> D

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
five this is just the next voicing of D

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.970 
five this is just the next voicing of D
major<00:01:22.690> so<00:01:23.690> here's<00:01:23.900> a<00:01:23.960> standard<00:01:24.230> D<00:01:24.590> major

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:26.980 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.560 

here's<00:01:27.980> the<00:01:28.130> next<00:01:28.310> triad<00:01:28.910> or<00:01:29.150> the<00:01:29.240> next<00:01:29.450> voice

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
here's the next triad or the next voice

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.020 
here's the next triad or the next voice
Univision<00:01:32.980> and<00:01:33.980> this<00:01:34.220> is<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:34.460> cool<00:01:34.610> trick<00:01:34.880> you

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
Univision and this is the cool trick you

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.780 
Univision and this is the cool trick you
just<00:01:35.110> get<00:01:36.110> rid<00:01:36.200> of<00:01:36.320> this<00:01:36.440> finger<00:01:36.710> and<00:01:37.100> you<00:01:37.610> just

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
just get rid of this finger and you just

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.900 
just get rid of this finger and you just
do<00:01:38.510> the<00:01:38.630> seventh<00:01:38.960> fret<00:01:39.140> with<00:01:39.290> your<00:01:39.910> little

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
do the seventh fret with your little

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.950 
do the seventh fret with your little
finger<00:01:42.700> and<00:01:43.700> then<00:01:43.880> you<00:01:44.000> can<00:01:44.180> hit<00:01:44.300> the<00:01:44.540> seventh

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
finger and then you can hit the seventh

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.450 
finger and then you can hit the seventh
fret<00:01:45.580> the<00:01:46.580> open<00:01:46.880> string<00:01:47.180> still<00:01:47.920> and<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:49.280> to

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
fret the open string still and the to

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.250 
fret the open string still and the to
seventh<00:01:49.850> frets<00:01:50.150> so<00:01:52.630> it's<00:01:53.630> just<00:01:53.720> a<00:01:53.869> vert<00:01:54.080> is

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
seventh frets so it's just a vert is

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.890 
seventh frets so it's just a vert is
just<00:01:54.500> a<00:01:54.650> B<00:01:54.830> minor<00:01:55.100> chords<00:01:55.640> it's<00:01:56.450> got<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.720> same

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
just a B minor chords it's got the same

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.690 
just a B minor chords it's got the same
notes<00:01:57.170> but<00:01:57.350> just<00:01:57.650> sounded<00:01:58.070> pretty<00:01:58.160> cool<00:01:58.400> this

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
notes but just sounded pretty cool this

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.570 
notes but just sounded pretty cool this
is<00:01:58.850> open<00:01:59.150> string<00:01:59.710> it<00:02:00.710> has<00:02:00.860> those<00:02:01.040> two<00:02:01.280> notes<00:02:01.430> in

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
is open string it has those two notes in

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.940 
is open string it has those two notes in
common<00:02:01.850> with<00:02:01.970> D<00:02:02.150> so<00:02:02.990> I<00:02:03.020> think<00:02:03.500> this<00:02:03.770> is<00:02:03.920> a

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
common with D so I think this is a

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:20.750 
common with D so I think this is a
pretty<00:02:04.130> useful<00:02:04.340> trick<00:02:04.729> you<00:02:05.000> can<00:02:05.090> be<00:02:05.210> like<00:02:05.330> this

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:31.080 

so<00:02:21.760> gusty<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:30.220> reason<00:02:30.490> I<00:02:30.520> like<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.730> get<00:02:30.970> up

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
so gusty and the reason I like to get up

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.180 
so gusty and the reason I like to get up
here<00:02:31.360> versus<00:02:31.810> staying<00:02:32.050> out<00:02:32.290> here<00:02:32.320> is<00:02:32.830> this<00:02:33.010> B

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
here versus staying out here is this B

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.590 
here versus staying out here is this B
minor<00:02:33.430> is<00:02:33.640> kind<00:02:33.850> of<00:02:33.940> hard<00:02:34.090> to<00:02:34.150> do<00:02:34.420> anything

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
minor is kind of hard to do anything

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.530 
minor is kind of hard to do anything
with<00:02:34.840> like<00:02:35.580> you<00:02:36.580> can<00:02:36.730> do<00:02:36.850> a<00:02:36.880> little<00:02:37.150> bit<00:02:37.330> with

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
with like you can do a little bit with

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.120 
with like you can do a little bit with
it<00:02:38.190> like<00:02:40.140> but<00:02:41.140> anytime<00:02:41.500> you're<00:02:41.709> doing<00:02:41.890> a<00:02:41.950> barre

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
it like but anytime you're doing a barre

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.650 
it like but anytime you're doing a barre
chord<00:02:42.160> shape<00:02:42.580> like<00:02:42.760> this<00:02:42.970> it's<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.270> little<00:02:43.360> hard

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
chord shape like this it's a little hard

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.949 
chord shape like this it's a little hard
to<00:02:44.310> really<00:02:45.310> extend<00:02:45.790> it<00:02:46.000> and<00:02:46.180> do<00:02:46.360> stuff<00:02:46.600> whereas

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
to really extend it and do stuff whereas

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:57.350 
to really extend it and do stuff whereas
this<00:02:47.140> shape<00:02:47.670> is<00:02:48.670> really<00:02:48.850> easy<00:02:49.090> to<00:02:49.180> start<00:02:52.650> right

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.550 

and<00:02:58.360> really<00:02:58.510> I<00:02:58.660> think<00:02:58.870> partly<00:02:59.140> is<00:02:59.260> that<00:02:59.470> you

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
and really I think partly is that you

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:17.970 
and really I think partly is that you
have<00:02:59.709> access<00:02:59.920> to<00:03:00.130> these<00:03:00.310> higher<00:03:00.550> notes<00:03:16.980> and

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
have access to these higher notes and

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.620 
have access to these higher notes and
you<00:03:18.160> can<00:03:18.250> get<00:03:18.400> to<00:03:18.580> a<00:03:18.610> major<00:03:18.970> chord<00:03:19.420> right<00:03:19.660> here

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
you can get to a major chord right here

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.000 
you can get to a major chord right here
so<00:03:22.630> yeah<00:03:22.750> usually<00:03:22.930> I<00:03:23.170> when<00:03:23.320> I'm<00:03:23.410> up<00:03:23.560> in<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:23.769> spy

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
so yeah usually I when I'm up in the spy

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.810 
so yeah usually I when I'm up in the spy

of<00:04:47.270> this<00:04:47.540> B<00:04:47.720> minor<00:04:47.960> shape<00:04:51.160> so<00:04:52.160> here<00:04:52.340> I<00:04:52.370> have<00:04:52.430> one

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
of this B minor shape so here I have one

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.370 
of this B minor shape so here I have one
example<00:04:53.000> of<00:04:53.180> a<00:04:53.330> real<00:04:53.510> song<00:04:53.720> I<00:04:53.750> made<00:04:53.870> up<00:04:54.020> that

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
example of a real song I made up that

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:05.659 
example of a real song I made up that
uses<00:04:54.710> this

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.159 

so<00:05:06.669> I<00:05:06.760> was<00:05:06.910> a<00:05:06.940> more<00:05:07.120> complicated<00:05:07.479> example<00:05:07.780> this

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
so I was a more complicated example this

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:11.100 
so I was a more complicated example this
is<00:05:08.350> a<00:05:08.380> song<00:05:09.250> I<00:05:09.280> made<00:05:09.550> a<00:05:09.580> while<00:05:10.270> ago<00:05:10.300> it's<00:05:10.900> D

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
is a song I made a while ago it's D

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.310 
is a song I made a while ago it's D
major<00:05:11.850> then<00:05:12.850> I<00:05:13.600> slide<00:05:13.930> into<00:05:14.169> like<00:05:14.350> an<00:05:14.470> a<00:05:14.620> chord

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
major then I slide into like an a chord

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.750 
major then I slide into like an a chord
then<00:05:17.320> I<00:05:17.410> slide<00:05:17.680> up<00:05:17.710> to<00:05:18.040> the<00:05:18.220> two<00:05:18.430> notes<00:05:18.639> that

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
then I slide up to the two notes that

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.610 
then I slide up to the two notes that
are<00:05:18.910> going<00:05:19.060> to<00:05:19.150> be<00:05:19.300> sort<00:05:20.139> of<00:05:20.169> part<00:05:20.320> of<00:05:20.410> the<00:05:20.470> B

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
are going to be sort of part of the B

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.700 
are going to be sort of part of the B
minor<00:05:20.830> an<00:05:20.949> end<00:05:21.160> to<00:05:21.460> this<00:05:21.550> D<00:05:22.260> and<00:05:23.260> then<00:05:23.470> I<00:05:23.530> go<00:05:23.680> to

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
minor an end to this D and then I go to

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:29.909 
minor an end to this D and then I go to
be<00:05:23.949> my<00:05:24.100> hair<00:05:26.639> then<00:05:27.639> a<00:05:27.880> major<00:05:28.180> I<00:05:28.750> cut<00:05:29.650> down<00:05:29.680> like

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
be my hair then a major I cut down like

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:46.740 
be my hair then a major I cut down like
this<00:05:44.310> then<00:05:45.310> later<00:05:45.580> in<00:05:45.790> that<00:05:45.910> song<00:05:46.150> I<00:05:46.389> think<00:05:46.450> I

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
this then later in that song I think I

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:52.320 
this then later in that song I think I
went<00:05:46.900> like<00:05:50.490> it's<00:05:51.490> right<00:05:51.639> there<00:05:51.820> I'm<00:05:51.940> using<00:05:52.060> the

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
went like it's right there I'm using the

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.170 
went like it's right there I'm using the
same<00:05:52.510> B<00:05:52.720> minor<00:05:52.930> chord<00:05:53.580> when<00:05:54.580> I'm<00:05:54.669> hitting<00:05:54.850> C

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
same B minor chord when I'm hitting C

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.010 
same B minor chord when I'm hitting C
sharp<00:05:55.450> up<00:05:55.630> on<00:05:55.810> top<00:05:56.020> which<00:05:56.320> makes<00:05:56.500> it<00:05:57.810> kind<00:05:58.810> of<00:05:58.900> a

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
sharp up on top which makes it kind of a

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.920 
sharp up on top which makes it kind of a
weird<00:05:59.260> sound<00:05:59.740> I<00:06:00.039> think<00:06:00.250> it<00:06:00.340> has<00:06:00.490> a<00:06:00.600> sharp<00:06:01.600> nine

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
weird sound I think it has a sharp nine

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:10.460 
weird sound I think it has a sharp nine
in<00:06:02.229> it<00:06:02.380> or<00:06:02.560> something

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.200 

and<00:06:11.470> I'm<00:06:11.800> shedding<00:06:12.039> when<00:06:12.610> I<00:06:12.639> started<00:06:13.060> doing

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
and I'm shedding when I started doing

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:19.290 
and I'm shedding when I started doing
this<00:06:13.450> shape<00:06:16.349> was<00:06:17.349> from<00:06:17.710> paranoid<00:06:18.669> android<00:06:19.030> or

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
this shape was from paranoid android or

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:27.350 
this shape was from paranoid android or
a<00:06:19.389> hit<00:06:19.630> song<00:06:19.810> because<00:06:20.229> they<00:06:20.349> they<00:06:20.800> go<00:06:20.950> away

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.719 

I<00:06:27.419> played<00:06:28.229> that<00:06:28.349> song<00:06:28.560> at<00:06:28.740> a<00:06:28.860> time<00:06:28.889> so<00:06:29.550> they're

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:29.729 
I played that song at a time so they're

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:33.939 
I played that song at a time so they're
using<00:06:30.030> this<00:06:30.150> C<00:06:30.419> minor<00:06:30.689> chord<00:06:30.840> and<00:06:32.300> then<00:06:33.300> I<00:06:33.330> just

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:33.949 
using this C minor chord and then I just

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:36.140 
using this C minor chord and then I just
was<00:06:34.949> tired<00:06:35.129> of<00:06:35.370> being<00:06:35.610> down<00:06:35.759> here<00:06:35.789> all<00:06:36.060> the

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
was tired of being down here all the

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.510 
was tired of being down here all the
time<00:06:36.330> so<00:06:36.599> I<00:06:36.629> started<00:06:36.960> trying<00:06:37.949> to<00:06:38.159> use<00:06:38.310> like

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
time so I started trying to use like

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.209 
time so I started trying to use like
these<00:06:38.780> these<00:06:39.780> triads<00:06:40.259> that<00:06:40.469> still<00:06:40.949> use<00:06:41.099> the

00:06:41.209 --> 00:06:41.219 
these these triads that still use the

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:48.909 
these these triads that still use the
open<00:06:41.490> string<00:06:41.789> like<00:06:42.060> you<00:06:42.150> could<00:06:42.300> do<00:06:42.389> this<00:06:42.539> one

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:48.919 

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:50.990 

because<00:06:49.919> when<00:06:50.009> you<00:06:50.069> have<00:06:50.189> access<00:06:50.580> to<00:06:50.610> the<00:06:50.699> open

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000 
because when you have access to the open

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.730 
because when you have access to the open
string<00:06:51.270> you<00:06:51.449> can<00:06:51.479> sort<00:06:51.990> of<00:06:52.110> get<00:06:52.319> more<00:06:52.500> creative

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.740 
string you can sort of get more creative

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.309 
string you can sort of get more creative
how<00:06:53.039> you<00:06:53.099> move<00:06:53.310> around<00:06:53.460> the<00:06:53.639> guitar<00:06:54.139> so<00:06:55.139> anyway

00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 
how you move around the guitar so anyway

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:58.639 
how you move around the guitar so anyway
so<00:06:55.469> just<00:06:56.009> try<00:06:56.159> this<00:06:56.219> deep
