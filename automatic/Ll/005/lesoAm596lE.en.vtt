solutions of linear systems part two

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.610 
solutions of linear systems part two
okay<00:00:11.610> let's<00:00:11.880> go<00:00:11.969> ahead<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:12.210> get<00:00:12.420> started<00:00:12.620> we

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
okay let's go ahead and get started we

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.849 
okay let's go ahead and get started we
closed<00:00:13.920> off<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.250> last<00:00:14.460> session<00:00:14.820> by

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:15.859 
closed off the last session by

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:19.990 
closed off the last session by
converting<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:16.949> following<00:00:17.490> matrix<00:00:17.930> and

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
converting the following matrix and

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.250 
converting the following matrix and
you'll<00:00:21.000> remember<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.420> course<00:00:21.480> sometimes<00:00:22.109> I

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
you'll remember of course sometimes I

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.929 
you'll remember of course sometimes I
actually<00:00:22.560> leave<00:00:22.710> off<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.890> little<00:00:23.130> brackets

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
actually leave off the little brackets

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.310 
actually leave off the little brackets
on<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.150> side<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.480> matrices<00:00:24.779> simply

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
on the side of the matrices simply

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.540 
on the side of the matrices simply
because<00:00:25.619> it's<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.949> it's<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.310> personal

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
because it's a it's a personal

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.670 
because it's a it's a personal
notational<00:00:27.269> preference<00:00:27.630> that's<00:00:27.840> all<00:00:28.019> as<00:00:28.470> long

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
notational preference that's all as long

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.960 
notational preference that's all as long
as<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.890> understand<00:00:29.340> which<00:00:29.519> grouping<00:00:29.880> of

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
as you understand which grouping of

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.180 
as you understand which grouping of
numbers<00:00:30.240> goes<00:00:30.420> together<00:00:31.040> okay<00:00:33.710> we<00:00:34.710> had<00:00:34.920> one

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
numbers goes together okay we had one

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.520 
numbers goes together okay we had one
two<00:00:35.399> three<00:00:35.790> nine<00:00:36.260> to<00:00:37.260> negative<00:00:38.100> 1<00:00:38.480> 18<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:40.550> 30

two three nine to negative 1 18 and 30
negative<00:00:43.530> 13<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.960> we<00:00:45.960> converted<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.649> to

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
negative 13 and we converted that to

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:57.860 
negative 13 and we converted that to

else in that column is a 0 this column
of<00:01:16.320> course<00:01:16.530> doesn't<00:01:16.770> matter<00:01:17.100> because<00:01:17.580> it's

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
of course doesn't matter because it's

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.940 
of course doesn't matter because it's
it's<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.290> third<00:01:19.560> row<00:01:19.979> here<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.450> is

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
it's the third row here so it is

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.170 
it's the third row here so it is
irrelevant<00:01:22.950> as<00:01:23.280> far<00:01:23.460> as<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> definition<00:01:24.119> of

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
irrelevant as far as the definition of

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.560 
irrelevant as far as the definition of
reduced<00:01:24.479> row<00:01:24.630> echelon<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:25.200> concerned<00:01:25.650> okay

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
reduced row echelon is concerned okay

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.679 
reduced row echelon is concerned okay
now<00:01:27.570> we<00:01:28.439> did<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.770> just<00:01:28.979> for<00:01:29.130> matrices<00:01:29.939> well

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
now we did that just for matrices well

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.240 
now we did that just for matrices well
we<00:01:30.960> already<00:01:31.140> know<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.740> given<00:01:31.950> matrix

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
we already know that a given matrix

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.460 
we already know that a given matrix
represents<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.329> linear<00:01:34.140> system<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.799> equations

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
represents a linear system of equations

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.499 
represents a linear system of equations
so<00:01:37.670> this<00:01:38.670> system<00:01:40.100> looks<00:01:41.100> like<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.610> in<00:01:41.909> terms

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
so this system looks like this in terms

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:50.300 
so this system looks like this in terms
of<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.780> variables<00:01:44.210> X<00:01:46.579> plus<00:01:47.579> 2y<00:01:48.590> plus<00:01:49.590> 3z

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
of the variables X plus 2y plus 3z

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.270 
of the variables X plus 2y plus 3z
equals<00:01:50.549> 9<00:01:51.119> notice<00:01:51.659> x<00:01:51.869> plus<00:01:52.140> 2y<00:01:52.350> plus<00:01:52.770> 3z<00:01:53.250> equals

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
equals 9 notice x plus 2y plus 3z equals

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:01.399 
equals 9 notice x plus 2y plus 3z equals
9<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.299> then<00:01:55.259> two<00:01:55.500> X<00:01:56.930> minus<00:01:57.930> y<00:01:58.350> plus<00:01:59.060> Z<00:02:00.409> equals

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
9 and then two X minus y plus Z equals

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.399 
9 and then two X minus y plus Z equals
eight<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:02.420> then<00:02:03.420> 3x<00:02:04.460> plus<00:02:05.479> 0y<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:07.229> don't

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
eight and then 3x plus 0y you don't

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.749 
eight and then 3x plus 0y you don't
necessarily<00:02:07.829> have<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.009> put<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:08.340> there<00:02:08.399> I

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
necessarily have to put this there I

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.580 
necessarily have to put this there I
like<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.270> put<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.539> there<00:02:09.690> simply<00:02:10.020> because<00:02:10.349> for

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
like to put it there simply because for

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.680 
like to put it there simply because for
me<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.830> keeps<00:02:11.039> things<00:02:11.220> in<00:02:11.610> order<00:02:11.819> in<00:02:12.150> line<00:02:12.420> and

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
me it keeps things in order in line and

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.200 
me it keeps things in order in line and
it<00:02:12.989> just

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
it just

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:19.410 
it just
keep<00:02:13.300> things<00:02:13.540> consistent<00:02:16.110> minus<00:02:17.110> Z<00:02:18.040> is<00:02:18.420> equal

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
keep things consistent minus Z is equal

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.630 
keep things consistent minus Z is equal
to<00:02:19.690> three<00:02:20.320> and<00:02:20.530> again<00:02:20.770> what<00:02:21.220> we've<00:02:21.370> done<00:02:21.400> is

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
to three and again what we've done is

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.460 
to three and again what we've done is
whenever<00:02:24.640> we<00:02:24.820> transform<00:02:25.450> a<00:02:25.540> matrix<00:02:25.900> from<00:02:26.170> the

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
whenever we transform a matrix from the

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.930 
whenever we transform a matrix from the
standard<00:02:26.770> matrix<00:02:26.950> to<00:02:27.310> its<00:02:27.460> reduced<00:02:27.790> row

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
standard matrix to its reduced row

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.820 
standard matrix to its reduced row
echelon<00:02:27.970> form<00:02:28.360> we<00:02:29.020> form<00:02:29.350> an<00:02:29.410> equivalent

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
echelon form we form an equivalent

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.290 
echelon form we form an equivalent
system<00:02:30.010> so<00:02:30.370> what<00:02:30.490> we've<00:02:30.640> produced<00:02:30.940> is<00:02:31.180> the

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
system so what we've produced is the

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.900 
system so what we've produced is the
following<00:02:32.190> this<00:02:33.190> time<00:02:33.430> I'm<00:02:33.640> going<00:02:33.820> to

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
following this time I'm going to

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.610 
following this time I'm going to
actually<00:02:34.090> avoid<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.870> zeros<00:02:35.820> we<00:02:36.820> have<00:02:37.620> x

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
actually avoid the zeros we have x
