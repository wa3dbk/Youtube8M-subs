00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 
down below and then of course there's no

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:18.570 
down below and then of course there's no
shoes<00:06:16.250> because<00:06:16.729> she's<00:06:16.940> a<00:06:16.970> zombie<00:06:17.090> of<00:06:17.509> course

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:18.580 
shoes because she's a zombie of course

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.159 
shoes because she's a zombie of course
but<00:06:19.580> then<00:06:19.760> really<00:06:20.060> quick<00:06:20.300> I'll<00:06:20.449> take<00:06:20.750> her<00:06:20.960> off

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:21.169 
but then really quick I'll take her off

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:23.589 
but then really quick I'll take her off
the<00:06:21.470> stand<00:06:21.919> and<00:06:22.250> she<00:06:22.340> actually<00:06:22.460> fits<00:06:23.240> really

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:23.599 
the stand and she actually fits really

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:25.750 
the stand and she actually fits really
well<00:06:23.750> in<00:06:24.169> here<00:06:24.440> it's<00:06:24.889> actually<00:06:25.010> kind<00:06:25.400> of<00:06:25.430> hard

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:25.760 
well in here it's actually kind of hard

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.089 
well in here it's actually kind of hard
to<00:06:25.849> take<00:06:26.120> her<00:06:26.210> out<00:06:26.270> sometimes<00:06:26.800> but<00:06:27.800> this<00:06:27.919> also

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:28.099 
to take her out sometimes but this also

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:30.820 
to take her out sometimes but this also
snaps<00:06:28.490> in<00:06:28.639> really<00:06:28.880> well<00:06:29.090> it's<00:06:29.510> I<00:06:30.139> think

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:30.830 
snaps in really well it's I think

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.649 
snaps in really well it's I think
personally<00:06:31.550> better<00:06:31.789> than<00:06:32.060> the<00:06:32.180> Monster<00:06:32.510> High

00:06:32.649 --> 00:06:32.659 
personally better than the Monster High

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:35.589 
personally better than the Monster High
scans<00:06:33.280> because<00:06:34.280> this<00:06:34.639> snaps<00:06:34.909> into<00:06:35.120> place<00:06:35.300> so

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:35.599 
scans because this snaps into place so

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:37.779 
scans because this snaps into place so
this<00:06:35.750> doesn't<00:06:35.960> fall<00:06:36.169> out<00:06:36.229> super<00:06:36.650> easily<00:06:36.830> like

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:37.789 
this doesn't fall out super easily like

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:39.159 
this doesn't fall out super easily like
with<00:06:37.940> Monster<00:06:38.240> High<00:06:38.389> scans<00:06:38.720> I<00:06:38.930> would<00:06:39.050> just

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:39.169 
with Monster High scans I would just

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:41.740 
with Monster High scans I would just
fall<00:06:39.470> off<00:06:39.680> if<00:06:39.889> I<00:06:40.010> did<00:06:40.190> that<00:06:40.360> then<00:06:41.360> right<00:06:41.570> here

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:41.750 
fall off if I did that then right here

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.210 
fall off if I did that then right here
on<00:06:41.840> the<00:06:41.900> back<00:06:42.050> you<00:06:42.110> can<00:06:42.380> actually<00:06:42.740> hold<00:06:43.010> this

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:43.220 
on the back you can actually hold this

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.980 
on the back you can actually hold this
fan<00:06:43.490> so<00:06:43.729> you<00:06:43.760> can<00:06:43.880> cool<00:06:44.030> the<00:06:44.570> doll

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:44.990 
fan so you can cool the doll

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.740 
fan so you can cool the doll
while<00:06:45.349> she's<00:06:45.560> still<00:06:45.770> under<00:06:45.919> stand<00:06:46.720> right<00:06:47.720> here
