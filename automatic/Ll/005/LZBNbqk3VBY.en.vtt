00:00:01.349 --> 00:00:02.860
 Hello 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:04.220
 after thorough 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.430
 checks all sizes 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.430
 interrupted him 

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:14.069
 It turned out that he criticized 

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:16.800
 in use 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.800
 vaccination hall 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.800
 Moscow really 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:24.429
 Here you decide 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:27.429
 could not think if we were clogged 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:30.099
 that is, you went 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.099
 initially processing 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.930
 if sheki 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.170
 connecting rod and indigenous turned out 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.630
 with sizes 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.630
 rise from size can be said 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.760
 such new purchases 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.360
 there was a lot of sand in this place 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.360
 a startup 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.290
 but I didnâ€™t like it right away 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.290
 no one 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.190
 so little but you don't lead 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.560
 By the way, they do not promise a little 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.560
 if there is no bank 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.510
 why was it packed 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.900
 although sales data 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.900
 a year before the factory 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.490
 I advise 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.810
 in addition to direct and to 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.810
 important before 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.340
 have a little bit 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.259
 bombs he 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.219
 there was a suggestion except 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:42.970
 because rings 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.480
 working out the principle as soon as i 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.660
 it seemed that he 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.660
 dimensions are normal 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.549
 that the growth of the economy to be 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.300
 careful when choosing 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.100
 once again all see all plant by 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.100
 what are you responsible for the assembled engine 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:10.910
 and bye given meetings
