just<00:02:27.710> melted<00:02:28.330> and<00:02:29.330> so<00:02:29.510> then<00:02:29.660> I<00:02:29.690> usually<00:02:29.990> just

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
just melted and so then I usually just

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.770 
just melted and so then I usually just
stick<00:02:30.380> that<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:30.800> side<00:02:31.330> put<00:02:32.330> that<00:02:32.510> in<00:02:32.600> there

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
stick that to the side put that in there

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.750 
stick that to the side put that in there
and<00:02:33.140> then<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.650> pot<00:02:33.890> that<00:02:34.220> you<00:02:34.340> just<00:02:34.550> got<00:02:34.700> it

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
and then the pot that you just got it

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.990 
and then the pot that you just got it
out<00:02:34.940> of<00:02:35.000> which<00:02:35.690> this<00:02:35.840> was<00:02:36.050> vex<00:02:36.640> you<00:02:37.640> take<00:02:37.820> this

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
out of which this was vex you take this

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.710 
out of which this was vex you take this
pot<00:02:38.330> and<00:02:38.810> I<00:02:39.709> don't<00:02:40.220> even<00:02:40.430> put<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.820> arm<00:02:41.060> rights

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
pot and I don't even put the arm rights

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.480 
pot and I don't even put the arm rights
paper<00:02:41.900> on<00:02:42.110> there<00:02:42.230> I<00:02:42.260> just<00:02:42.530> stick<00:02:42.740> this<00:02:42.770> pot<00:02:43.160> on

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
paper on there I just stick this pot on

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.250 
paper on there I just stick this pot on
the<00:02:43.760> flat<00:02:44.630> iron<00:02:44.780> just<00:02:45.080> for<00:02:45.320> about<00:02:47.110> right<00:02:48.110> now

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
the flat iron just for about right now

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.380 
the flat iron just for about right now
you<00:02:48.500> were<00:02:48.970> ten<00:02:49.970> ten<00:02:50.480> seconds<00:02:50.959> max<00:02:51.200> and<00:02:52.390> then

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
you were ten ten seconds max and then

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.300 
you were ten ten seconds max and then
you<00:02:53.510> take<00:02:53.720> this<00:02:53.959> and<00:02:54.020> you<00:02:54.410> that<00:02:54.950> should<00:02:55.220> have

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
you take this and you that should have

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.900 
you take this and you that should have
melted<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:55.790> glue<00:02:55.820> enough<00:02:56.450> for<00:02:56.690> you<00:02:56.840> to<00:02:57.910> get

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
melted the glue enough for you to get

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:05.510 
melted the glue enough for you to get
the<00:02:59.590> label<00:03:00.590> off

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.260 

they<00:03:06.520> are<00:03:08.640> and<00:03:09.640> then<00:03:09.790> there<00:03:09.910> will<00:03:10.000> be<00:03:10.060> some

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
they are and then there will be some

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.880 
they are and then there will be some
sticky<00:03:10.660> stuff<00:03:10.840> on<00:03:11.020> the<00:03:11.110> back<00:03:11.260> of<00:03:11.290> here<00:03:11.530> anyway

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
sticky stuff on the back of here anyway

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.220 
sticky stuff on the back of here anyway
and<00:03:12.520> say<00:03:12.880> put<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:13.240> label<00:03:13.630> back<00:03:13.810> on<00:03:14.050> your

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
and say put the label back on your

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:24.660 
and say put the label back on your
shadow<00:03:14.680> so<00:03:15.430> I'll<00:03:16.420> just<00:03:16.480> take<00:03:16.900> this<00:03:17.110> off

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.530 

I'm<00:03:25.670> alongside<00:03:25.940> there<00:03:26.930> so<00:03:27.410> just<00:03:27.620> like<00:03:27.830> that

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
I'm alongside there so just like that

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.250 
I'm alongside there so just like that
then<00:03:29.540> it<00:03:29.599> pops<00:03:29.810> right<00:03:29.930> in<00:03:30.290> my<00:03:31.450> palate<00:03:32.450> just

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
then it pops right in my palate just

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.410 
then it pops right in my palate just
like<00:03:33.410> that<00:03:33.590> and<00:03:34.250> what<00:03:34.400> I'll<00:03:34.520> eventually<00:03:34.790> do<00:03:35.150> is

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
like that and what I'll eventually do is

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.059 
like that and what I'll eventually do is
whenever<00:03:35.900> I<00:03:36.110> get<00:03:36.260> them<00:03:36.349> all<00:03:36.470> and<00:03:36.709> done<00:03:36.830> I'm

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
whenever I get them all and done I'm

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.309 
whenever I get them all and done I'm
going<00:03:37.220> to<00:03:37.310> redo<00:03:37.790> all<00:03:37.970> my<00:03:38.000> palettes<00:03:38.569> that<00:03:38.780> I

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
going to redo all my palettes that I

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.809 
going to redo all my palettes that I
eventually<00:03:39.890> put<00:03:40.069> the<00:03:40.160> names<00:03:40.400> right<00:03:40.640> there

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
eventually put the names right there

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:42.699 
eventually put the names right there
because<00:03:41.120> I<00:03:41.180> just<00:03:41.390> like<00:03:41.540> to<00:03:41.660> know<00:03:41.810> exactly<00:03:42.349> what

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
because I just like to know exactly what

so first thing you do is you take this

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.090 
so first thing you do is you take this
little<00:03:56.120> tool<00:03:56.530> put<00:03:57.530> it<00:03:57.620> in<00:03:57.680> that<00:03:57.830> little

little tool put it in that little

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.570 
little tool put it in that little
crevice<00:03:59.830> this<00:04:00.830> is<00:04:00.920> another<00:04:01.100> thing<00:04:01.400> this

crevice this is another thing this

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.039 
crevice this is another thing this
little<00:04:01.910> thing<00:04:02.090> right<00:04:02.120> here<00:04:02.269> will<00:04:02.600> get<00:04:02.750> kind<00:04:02.959> of

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
little thing right here will get kind of

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.949 
little thing right here will get kind of
gummy<00:04:03.370> because<00:04:04.370> of<00:04:04.489> the<00:04:04.610> glue<00:04:04.850> I<00:04:05.239> just<00:04:05.780> have<00:04:05.930> a

see so put that right in there not going
to<00:04:18.799> wedge<00:04:19.010> it<00:04:19.299> right<00:04:20.299> in<00:04:20.600> that<00:04:20.780> little<00:04:21.169> line

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
to wedge it right in that little line

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:29.520 
to wedge it right in that little line
right<00:04:22.010> there<00:04:25.840> and<00:04:26.840> just<00:04:27.050> it'll<00:04:27.440> pop<00:04:27.620> right<00:04:27.650> out

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
right there and just it'll pop right out

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.950 
right there and just it'll pop right out
put<00:04:30.530> that<00:04:30.650> to<00:04:30.800> the<00:04:30.830> side

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.969

side you snip and when you snip it you

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.570 
side you snip and when you snip it you
need<00:04:44.240> to<00:04:44.330> go<00:04:44.419> all<00:04:44.690> the<00:04:44.750> way<00:04:45.020> into<00:04:45.410> that<00:04:45.770> to
