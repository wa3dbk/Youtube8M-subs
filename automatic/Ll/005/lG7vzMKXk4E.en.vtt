player better the gunplay feels a lot

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.580 
player better the gunplay feels a lot
more<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.820> we<00:01:27.509> know<00:01:27.630> not<00:01:27.930> only<00:01:27.990> dice<00:01:28.409> we're

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
more so we know not only dice we're

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.670 
more so we know not only dice we're
working<00:01:28.920> on<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.420> I<00:01:30.420> gotta<00:01:30.630> say<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.049> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
working on it and I gotta say that the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.800 
working on it and I gotta say that the
gunplay<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.280> not<00:01:32.549> as<00:01:32.700> snappy<00:01:33.180> as<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.540> most<00:01:33.720> in

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
gunplay is not as snappy as it most in

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.109 
gunplay is not as snappy as it most in
battlefield<00:01:34.140> 3<00:01:34.170> but<00:01:34.530> it's<00:01:34.650> somewhere<00:01:34.890> between

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
battlefield 3 but it's somewhere between

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.039 
battlefield 3 but it's somewhere between
battlefield<00:01:36.119> bad<00:01:36.299> company<00:01:36.420> two<00:01:36.810> and

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
battlefield bad company two and

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.140 
battlefield bad company two and
battlefield<00:01:37.350> 3<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.369> really<00:01:38.610> like<00:01:38.729> gunplay

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150

miss a lot better in Belfield hardline
and<00:02:08.940> once<00:02:09.629> again<00:02:09.720> since<00:02:10.440> this<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.800> spin-off

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
and once again since this is a spin-off

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.050 
and once again since this is a spin-off
it<00:02:11.520> feels<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.819> little

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
it feels a little

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.210 
it feels a little
a<00:02:12.540> KD<00:02:12.870> ish<00:02:13.050> which<00:02:13.380> is<00:02:13.500> not<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.650> bad<00:02:13.709> thing<00:02:13.860> in<00:02:14.130> my

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
a KD ish which is not a bad thing in my

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.750 
a KD ish which is not a bad thing in my
opinion<00:02:14.250> because<00:02:15.090> i<00:02:15.569> think<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.920> game<00:02:17.099> works

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
opinion because i think the game works

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.820 
opinion because i think the game works
like<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.270> works<00:02:18.510> it's<00:02:18.840> playable<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.410> can<00:02:19.590> play

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
like it works it's playable you can play

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.620 
like it works it's playable you can play
it<00:02:19.860> on<00:02:20.010> a<00:02:20.069> competitive<00:02:20.400> face<00:02:20.790> like<00:02:21.090> I'm<00:02:21.330> not

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
it on a competitive face like I'm not

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.660 
it on a competitive face like I'm not
like<00:02:21.810> super<00:02:22.110> esports<00:02:22.590> competitive<00:02:23.069> but<00:02:23.250> it

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
like super esports competitive but it

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.280 
like super esports competitive but it
works<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.090> this<00:02:24.209> is<00:02:24.330> only<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.569> beta<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.050> it's

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
works and this is only the beta and it's

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.020 
works and this is only the beta and it's
already<00:02:25.590> better<00:02:25.830> than<00:02:25.980> battlefield<00:02:26.489> 4<00:02:26.670> so<00:02:26.880> I'm

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
already better than battlefield 4 so I'm

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.339 
already better than battlefield 4 so I'm
really<00:02:27.300> enjoying<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:27.840> I'm<00:02:27.930> having<00:02:28.050> fun

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349

really enjoying it and I'm having fun
with<00:02:28.530> it<00:02:28.650> also<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.940> since<00:02:30.300> this<00:02:30.480> is<00:02:30.540> only<00:02:30.780> a

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
with it also and since this is only a

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.680 
with it also and since this is only a
beta<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.500> we're<00:02:31.800> still<00:02:32.160> way<00:02:32.700> way<00:02:33.180> ahead<00:02:33.510> of
