mechanical<00:03:00.590> robotic<00:03:01.590> in<00:03:01.709> his<00:03:01.860> past<00:03:02.190> sets<00:03:02.580> like

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
mechanical robotic in his past sets like

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.390 
mechanical robotic in his past sets like
to<00:03:03.300> see<00:03:03.480> him<00:03:03.570> play<00:03:03.840> stronger<00:03:04.350> and<00:03:05.040> I<00:03:05.160> think

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
to see him play stronger and I think

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.070 
to see him play stronger and I think
he's<00:03:05.520> got<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.820> improve<00:03:06.150> in<00:03:06.330> his<00:03:06.480> in<00:03:06.690> terms<00:03:06.720> of
