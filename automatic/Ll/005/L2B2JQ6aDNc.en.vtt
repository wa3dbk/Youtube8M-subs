00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
I think during the long jean stage

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.210 
I think during the long jean stage
during<00:02:48.129> the<00:02:48.250> initial<00:02:49.150> day<00:02:49.560> we've<00:02:50.560> got<00:02:50.950> more

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
during the initial day we've got more

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.309 
during the initial day we've got more
invested<00:02:51.819> as<00:02:51.970> a<00:02:52.120> row<00:02:52.300> to<00:02:52.629> cut<00:02:52.840> these<00:02:53.050> all

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
invested as a row to cut these all

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.710 
invested as a row to cut these all
people<00:02:53.769> victory<00:02:54.400> there<00:02:54.819> are<00:02:54.970> less<00:02:56.550> important

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
people victory there are less important

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.300 
people victory there are less important
those<00:02:58.720> people<00:02:59.080> who<00:02:59.200> understand<00:02:59.980> that<00:03:00.129> gays

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
those people who understand that gays
