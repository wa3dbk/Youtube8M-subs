00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.540
 O

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.520
 understood then you are going to give a 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.890
 olhadinha has a new path program 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.260
 you stay a little longer in the 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.779
 internet, I just saw everything there, all right 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.019
 if it can close off and is not a 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.519
 book I know the review of the name of the wand 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.189
 with too short 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.469
 It's absurd to talk then we talk about 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:49.500
 the fear of the Sabbath now means not 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:52.110
 now after seeing the series the chronicle of 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.170
 killer king, this is from here in the middle 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.239
 between the juvenile and the adult 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.270
 is not as innocent as an order 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.520
 the archers but also will not then 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.480
 fluency in sinuous mali with the chronicles 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.479
 of ice and fire 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.130
 The point is that on ice and fire or if it is 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.950
 dumb and good 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.400
 or you're smart and mean because 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.659
 what is 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.680
 no character is good and 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.500
 smart as our character 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.409
 the people who are sure to 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:27.799
 matter is sneaky has a fury 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:30.240
 immense or probably killed the king 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:33.659
 but at the same time he has a 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.030
 awareness and take the blame for 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.400
 everything that understands the world 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.530
 The story begins exactly where the 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.130
 first book ended his is 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.649
 simply turning the page and ready 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.630
 there was book 2 and as the second to 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.790
 people already perceive a pre- 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.509
 determined in history for those who do not 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.450
 know the narrative shows which already adult 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.930
 passing by a simple innkeeper and 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.909
 a city in the interior and suddenly a 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.549
 chronicler discovers 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.069
 secret and he begins to tell 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.110
 fantastic story of your life there are 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.599
 many legends and lies that are 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.030
 told about it then it does not stop 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:18.330
 have a little connection with that movie 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.700
 emas tom lie 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.760
 each book is a sunny day was 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.150
 counted and here on the second day it starts 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.650
 talking about university and then 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.560
 begins to talk about the period he 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.690
 chased the wind which is another way of 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.319
 to say that he went out there prepping 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.510
 all in the noise playing section in the 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.090
 the adventures of the body in this 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.069
 history are even more interesting than 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.840
 than the first book because it 's you 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.150
 Heard of the Julian daughter. 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.519
 You do not know if it's a place if a 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.920
 person if it's a bug and here you 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.200
 discovers everything and we also have the 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.750
 color training with dengue years 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.410
 we have their strange culture and very 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.420
 more 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.910
 There are lots of cool things to say. 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:08.130
 about this book but most of them 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:10.319
 it comes down to and fear is attention this 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.540
 volume to be able to work 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.780
 inside a strange universe full of 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.030
 dark magic knowledge and a good 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.500
 dose of laughter and other emotions 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.470
 strong 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.480
 read without moderation public problem is 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:31.290
 that different from a book that people 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:33.720
 just type and if we end type is 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.329
 difficult to say which of the two names is the 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.299
 the prettiest cloak I ever got drooling 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:40.950
 the inside is nice too 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:43.530
 there are still some perceptible errors 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.019
 but are not able to ruin your 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.090
 Do not be alarmed by the size of the 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.040
 book also because I know that in the end 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.900
