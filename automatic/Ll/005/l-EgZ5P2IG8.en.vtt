technology does not wait for the
economy's<00:01:08.539> growth<00:01:08.780> so<00:01:09.410> there's<00:01:09.740> a<00:01:09.830> lot<00:01:10.009> of<00:01:10.160> new

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
economy's growth so there's a lot of new

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.400 
economy's growth so there's a lot of new

out<00:01:12.560> there<00:01:12.590> as<00:01:13.459> far<00:01:13.610> as<00:01:13.729> information

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
out there as far as information

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.699 
out there as far as information
technology<00:01:14.330> is<00:01:14.810> concerned<00:01:15.170> I<00:01:15.470> think

00:01:15.699 --> 00:01:15.709 
technology is concerned I think

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:17.199 
technology is concerned I think
ultimately<00:01:16.220> technology<00:01:16.429> doesn't<00:01:17.060> matter

00:01:17.199 --> 00:01:17.209 
ultimately technology doesn't matter

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:20.290 
ultimately technology doesn't matter
without<00:01:18.140> it<00:01:18.440> meeting<00:01:19.190> some<00:01:19.429> type<00:01:19.640> of<00:01:19.670> need<00:01:20.030> and

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
without it meeting some type of need and
