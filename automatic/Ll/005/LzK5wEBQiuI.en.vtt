00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
series we were doing on scales and how

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.570 
series we were doing on scales and how
to<00:00:12.509> put<00:00:12.719> them<00:00:12.809> together<00:00:13.009> and<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.160> first<00:00:14.400> one

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
to put them together and the first one

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.450 
to put them together and the first one
we<00:00:14.700> did<00:00:14.730> was<00:00:15.269> on<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.599> major<00:00:16.139> scale<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.830> I

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
we did was on the a major scale and I

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.160 
we did was on the a major scale and I
mentioned<00:00:17.880> we<00:00:18.000> were<00:00:18.060> going<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.359> do<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.869> video

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
mentioned we were going to do a video

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.529 
mentioned we were going to do a video
talking<00:00:19.770> about<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.550> relative<00:00:20.699> minor<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.420> the

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
talking about the relative minor to the

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.370 
talking about the relative minor to the
a<00:00:21.630> major<00:00:21.990> scale<00:00:22.350> which<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.580> six<00:00:24.359> in<00:00:24.660> the

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
a major scale which is the six in the

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.310 
a major scale which is the six in the
the<00:00:26.010> scale<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.210> F<00:00:27.420> sharp<00:00:27.449> minor

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
the scale and that is the F sharp minor

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.160 
the scale and that is the F sharp minor
pentatonic<00:00:29.070> scale<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.730> so<00:00:30.240> this<00:00:30.689> video<00:00:30.990> is

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
pentatonic scale and so this video is

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.620 
pentatonic scale and so this video is
going<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.349> show<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:32.550> scale<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.270> then

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
going to show you that scale and then

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.540 
going to show you that scale and then
we're<00:00:33.719> going<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.870> be<00:00:33.989> doing<00:00:34.230> another<00:00:34.649> video<00:00:35.340> to

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
we're going to be doing another video to

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.680 
we're going to be doing another video to
show<00:00:35.700> how<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:35.969> put<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.239> two<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.390> them<00:00:36.570> together

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
show how to put the two of them together

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.280 
show how to put the two of them together
so<00:00:37.940> we're<00:00:38.940> going<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.120> start<00:00:39.450> just<00:00:39.719> basic<00:00:40.140> with

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
so we're going to start just basic with

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.119 
so we're going to start just basic with
the<00:00:40.379> basic<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.340> minor<00:00:41.969> pentatonic<00:00:42.329> scale<00:00:42.870> and

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
the basic and minor pentatonic scale and

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.619 
the basic and minor pentatonic scale and
what<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.489> will<00:00:44.610> see<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.030> these<00:00:45.270> fingers

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
what you will see is that these fingers

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.720 
what you will see is that these fingers
four<00:00:46.020> fingers<00:00:46.050> will<00:00:46.530> stay<00:00:46.770> on<00:00:47.070> these<00:00:47.489> four

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
four fingers will stay on these four

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.830 
four fingers will stay on these four
frets<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.239> they're<00:00:48.360> not<00:00:48.450> going<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.719> move

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
frets and they're not going to move

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.529 
frets and they're not going to move
except<00:00:49.410> up<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.070> down<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.789> can<00:00:51.149> bank<00:00:51.390> on

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
to help when we put the two scales to

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.170 
to help when we put the two scales to
get<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.950> so<00:01:07.950> we<00:01:08.130> start<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.490> second<00:01:08.850> fret

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
get it so we start in the second fret

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.350 
get it so we start in the second fret
every<00:01:09.840> string<00:01:10.560> we<00:01:11.189> hit<00:01:11.460> we<00:01:11.760> start<00:01:12.060> on<00:01:12.270> the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
every string we hit we start on the

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.350 
every string we hit we start on the
second<00:01:12.689> fret<00:01:12.869> all<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.619> way<00:01:13.710> down<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.670> that

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
second fret all the way down and so that

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.789 
second fret all the way down and so that
is<00:01:15.600> going<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.810> be<00:01:15.930> pretty<00:01:16.140> helpful<00:01:16.350> because

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
is going to be pretty helpful because

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.080 
is going to be pretty helpful because
you'll<00:01:16.950> know<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.159> every<00:01:17.610> time<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.880> go<00:01:18.030> to

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
you'll know that every time you go to

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.160 
you'll know that every time you go to
the<00:01:18.180> next<00:01:18.450> string<00:01:18.630> that's<00:01:18.869> where<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.049> going

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
the next string that's where you going

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.960 
the next string that's where you going
to<00:01:19.229> start<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:19.920> your<00:01:20.070> index<00:01:20.369> finger<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.729> home

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
to start so your index finger is home

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.690 
to start so your index finger is home
for<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.810> scale<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.439> for<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:22.770> key<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.280> going

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
for this scale and for this key is going

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.780 
for this scale and for this key is going
to<00:01:23.939> be<00:01:24.060> on<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.840> second<00:01:25.200> fret<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:26.130> here's<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
to be on the second fret so here's the

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.330 
to be on the second fret so here's the
scale<00:01:27.000> first<00:01:27.360> off<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.900> straight<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.220> will

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
scale first off the straight and I will

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.200 
scale first off the straight and I will
show<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.880> then<00:01:29.939> I'm<00:01:30.060> going<00:01:30.180> to

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
show you that and then I'm going to

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.930 
show you that and then I'm going to
break<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.479> down<00:01:30.509> for<00:01:30.810> you

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.450 

backwards

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.760 

and<00:01:41.060> so<00:01:41.360> if<00:01:41.540> you're<00:01:41.660> paying<00:01:42.140> attention<00:01:42.260> it

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
and so if you're paying attention it

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.650 
and so if you're paying attention it
does<00:01:42.950> actually<00:01:43.190> look<00:01:43.610> pretty<00:01:43.640> easy<00:01:44.030> and<00:01:44.360> it<00:01:44.450> is

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
does actually look pretty easy and it is

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.930 
does actually look pretty easy and it is
that<00:01:45.320> easy<00:01:45.590> and<00:01:45.890> as<00:01:46.250> I<00:01:46.370> mentioned<00:01:46.730> we're<00:01:46.910> going

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
that easy and as I mentioned we're going

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.120 
that easy and as I mentioned we're going
to<00:01:47.060> keep<00:01:47.240> this<00:01:47.390> finger<00:01:47.600> here<00:01:47.930> for<00:01:48.260> for<00:01:48.710> every

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
to keep this finger here for for every

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.860 
to keep this finger here for for every
single<00:01:49.430> string<00:01:49.610> we<00:01:49.760> go<00:01:49.910> on<00:01:50.090> so<00:01:50.540> this<00:01:50.660> is<00:01:50.780> the
