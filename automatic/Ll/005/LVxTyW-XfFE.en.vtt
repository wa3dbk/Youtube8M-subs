for<00:00:27.670> all<00:00:27.970> of<00:00:28.180> the<00:00:28.570> votans<00:00:29.020> of<00:00:29.230> this<00:00:29.350> type<00:00:29.650> it's

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
for all of the votans of this type it's

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.330 
for all of the votans of this type it's
just<00:00:30.130> the<00:00:30.250> length<00:00:30.460> of<00:00:30.700> the<00:00:30.820> unit<00:00:30.970> that<00:00:31.390> varies

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.650 
just the length of the unit that varies
before<00:00:33.340> we<00:00:33.490> start<00:00:33.760> we're<00:00:34.090> just<00:00:34.240> going<00:00:34.420> to<00:00:34.510> make

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
before we start we're just going to make

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.750 
before we start we're just going to make
sure<00:00:34.690> that<00:00:34.990> we've<00:00:35.680> carried<00:00:36.040> out<00:00:36.160> a<00:00:36.190> few<00:00:36.430> safety

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
sure that we've carried out a few safety

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.050 
sure that we've carried out a few safety
points<00:00:37.270> I<00:00:37.480> that<00:00:38.020> we've<00:00:38.200> isolated<00:00:38.980> the<00:00:39.760> unit

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.060 
points I that we've isolated the unit

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.860 
points I that we've isolated the unit
from<00:00:40.210> the<00:00:40.360> mains

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
from the mains

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.380 
from the mains
so<00:00:41.230> we've<00:00:41.470> disconnected<00:00:42.130> the<00:00:42.340> unit<00:00:43.150> from<00:00:43.329> the

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
so we've disconnected the unit from the

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.010 
so we've disconnected the unit from the
mains

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
mains

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.110

and<00:00:44.220> secondly<00:00:45.220> we're<00:00:45.610> making<00:00:45.940> sure<00:00:45.970> that

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
and secondly we're making sure that

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.790 
and secondly we're making sure that
we're<00:00:46.390> wearing<00:00:46.720> protective<00:00:47.140> gloves<00:00:47.440> because

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
we're wearing protective gloves because

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.140 
we're wearing protective gloves because
we're<00:00:48.130> handling<00:00:48.430> a<00:00:48.640> product<00:00:49.000> that's

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
touching it with our fingers I'm going

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.010 
touching it with our fingers I'm going
to<00:02:02.630> use<00:02:02.840> a<00:02:02.870> piece<00:02:03.170> of<00:02:03.440> tissue<00:02:04.900> which<00:02:05.900> will

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
to use a piece of tissue which will

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.900 
to use a piece of tissue which will
allow<00:02:06.260> me<00:02:06.290> to<00:02:06.470> remove<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.460> quartz<00:02:07.850> tube

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.800 
together with its securing collar it's
very<00:02:13.430> important<00:02:13.970> that<00:02:14.150> that<00:02:14.270> doesn't<00:02:14.540> get

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
very important that that doesn't get

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.690 
very important that that doesn't get
broken<00:02:14.990> so<00:02:15.560> it's<00:02:15.830> worthwhile<00:02:16.040> putting<00:02:16.580> it

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
broken so it's worthwhile putting it

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.430 
broken so it's worthwhile putting it
somewhere<00:02:17.060> it<00:02:17.209> won't<00:02:17.480> roll<00:02:17.720> off<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:17.930> table

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
somewhere it won't roll off the table

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.380 
somewhere it won't roll off the table
because<00:02:18.770> if<00:02:18.950> it<00:02:19.070> gets<00:02:19.190> broken<00:02:19.580> it's<00:02:20.030> obviously

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
because if it gets broken it's obviously

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
because if it gets broken it's obviously
an<00:02:20.510> expensive<00:02:20.990> item<00:02:21.080> to<00:02:21.470> replace<00:02:23.230> then<00:02:24.230> to

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
an expensive item to replace then to

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.710 
an expensive item to replace then to
remove<00:02:24.709> the<00:02:24.860> bowl<00:02:25.070> we<00:02:25.580> then<00:02:25.790> use<00:02:26.240> a<00:02:26.270> piece<00:02:26.570> of

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
remove the bowl we then use a piece of

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.590 
remove the bowl we then use a piece of
tissue<00:02:26.900> paper<00:02:27.080> again<00:02:27.709> and<00:02:27.950> just<00:02:28.880> lift<00:02:29.420> the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
tissue paper again and just lift the

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.460 
tissue paper again and just lift the
bulb<00:02:30.100> by<00:02:31.100> pulling<00:02:31.489> it<00:02:31.640> out<00:02:31.790> like<00:02:32.570> so<00:02:35.050> to<00:02:36.050> refit

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
bulb by pulling it out like so to refit

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.650 
bulb by pulling it out like so to refit
a<00:02:36.500> new<00:02:36.770> bulb

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
a new bulb

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.090 
a new bulb
you<00:02:38.660> basically<00:02:38.840> have<00:02:39.140> to<00:02:39.290> take<00:02:39.590> it<00:02:39.739> out<00:02:39.860> of<00:02:39.890> the

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
you basically have to take it out of the

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.060 
you basically have to take it out of the
package<00:02:40.459> and<00:02:40.760> then<00:02:41.660> using<00:02:42.440> a<00:02:42.500> piece<00:02:42.680> of<00:02:42.860> tissue

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
package and then using a piece of tissue

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.140 
package and then using a piece of tissue
to<00:02:43.400> protect<00:02:43.790> it

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
to protect it

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.000 
to protect it
we<00:02:44.750> need<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:45.020> fit<00:02:45.230> it<00:02:45.350> back<00:02:45.380> into<00:02:45.739> the

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
we need to fit it back into the

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.420 
we need to fit it back into the
electrical<00:02:46.640> head<00:02:46.880> and<00:02:47.120> it's<00:02:47.330> just<00:02:47.420> a<00:02:48.400> case<00:02:49.400> of

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
electrical head and it's just a case of

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.009 
electrical head and it's just a case of
lining<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:50.510> contacts<00:02:51.410> up<00:02:52.720> pushing<00:02:53.720> it<00:02:53.840> in

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
lining the contacts up pushing it in

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.360 
lining the contacts up pushing it in
place<00:02:55.060> nice<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:56.090> firmly<00:02:56.570> and<00:02:56.959> then<00:02:57.370> refitting

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
place nice and firmly and then refitting

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.520 
place nice and firmly and then refitting
the<00:02:58.400> protective<00:02:59.060> cap<00:02:59.360> onto<00:02:59.630> the<00:03:00.049> end<00:03:00.260> of<00:03:00.470> the

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
the protective cap onto the end of the

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.520 
the protective cap onto the end of the
bulb<00:03:00.799> like<00:03:01.190> so<00:03:01.480> this<00:03:02.480> basically<00:03:02.930> stops<00:03:03.350> the

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
bulb like so this basically stops the

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.039 
bulb like so this basically stops the
bulb<00:03:03.739> from<00:03:03.890> rattling<00:03:04.340> against<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.420> core<00:03:05.660> tube

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
bulb from rattling against the core tube

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.360 
bulb from rattling against the core tube
and<00:03:06.230> braking<00:03:08.170> we<00:03:09.170> then<00:03:09.350> refit<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:10.010> quartz

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
and braking we then refit the quartz

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.630 
and braking we then refit the quartz
tube<00:03:10.840> again<00:03:11.840> using<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.350> piece<00:03:12.560> of<00:03:12.709> tissue<00:03:12.950> to

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
tube again using the piece of tissue to

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:22.180 
tube again using the piece of tissue to
protect<00:03:14.239> it<00:03:19.060> by<00:03:20.060> sliding<00:03:20.510> it<00:03:20.720> in<00:03:20.930> place<00:03:21.190> and

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
protect it by sliding it in place and

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.699 
protect it by sliding it in place and
making<00:03:22.549> sure<00:03:22.880> that<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.209> o-ring<00:03:23.630> seal<00:03:23.959> is

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
making sure that the o-ring seal is

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.710 
making sure that the o-ring seal is
pushed<00:03:25.100> down<00:03:25.220> between<00:03:25.700> the<00:03:25.880> quartz<00:03:26.239> tube<00:03:26.330> and

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
pushed down between the quartz tube and

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.560 
pushed down between the quartz tube and
the<00:03:26.780> bulb<00:03:27.019> and<00:03:27.310> then<00:03:28.310> retightening<00:03:29.150> the

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
the bulb and then retightening the

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
the bulb and then retightening the
clamping<00:03:29.989> nozzle<00:03:31.390> so<00:03:32.390> we've<00:03:32.540> now<00:03:32.720> refitted

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
clamping nozzle so we've now refitted

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.430 
clamping nozzle so we've now refitted
the<00:03:33.620> quartz<00:03:34.070> tube<00:03:34.160> into<00:03:34.940> the<00:03:35.260> electrical<00:03:36.260> head

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
the quartz tube into the electrical head

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.740 
the quartz tube into the electrical head
and<00:03:36.830> before<00:03:37.790> we<00:03:37.970> complete<00:03:38.390> the<00:03:38.510> assembly

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
and before we complete the assembly

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.030 
and before we complete the assembly
we're<00:03:39.049> just<00:03:39.200> going<00:03:39.380> to<00:03:39.440> make<00:03:39.650> sure<00:03:39.860> that

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
we're just going to make sure that

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.640 
we're just going to make sure that
there's<00:03:40.280> no<00:03:40.630> sediment<00:03:41.630> or<00:03:41.870> algae<00:03:42.350> on<00:03:42.470> the

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
there's no sediment or algae on the

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.020 
there's no sediment or algae on the
quartz<00:03:42.980> tube<00:03:43.040> and<00:03:43.430> if<00:03:43.519> there<00:03:43.670> is<00:03:43.760> we're<00:03:43.940> going

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
quartz tube and if there is we're going

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.470 
quartz tube and if there is we're going
to<00:03:44.209> wipe<00:03:44.450> that<00:03:44.630> off<00:03:44.690> with<00:03:45.650> a<00:03:45.680> tissue<00:03:45.950> and<00:03:46.480> it's

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
to wipe that off with a tissue and it's

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.259 
to wipe that off with a tissue and it's
best<00:03:47.750> to<00:03:47.810> use<00:03:47.900> a<00:03:48.380> 50/50<00:03:49.250> solution<00:03:49.730> of<00:03:49.880> vinegar

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269

off<00:03:53.060> the<00:03:53.329> quartz<00:03:53.630> tube<00:03:53.690> to<00:03:54.410> make<00:03:54.560> sure<00:03:54.680> that

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
off the quartz tube to make sure that

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.070 
off the quartz tube to make sure that
it's<00:03:54.980> nice<00:03:55.160> and<00:03:55.370> clean<00:03:55.640> so<00:03:56.299> that<00:03:56.329> the<00:03:56.660> maximum

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
it's nice and clean so that the maximum

has been fitted and fully tightened we
can<00:04:09.010> refit<00:04:09.489> the<00:04:09.640> clamping<00:04:10.030> screw<00:04:10.360> that<00:04:10.630> we

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
can refit the clamping screw that we

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.380 
can refit the clamping screw that we
took<00:04:10.900> there<00:04:11.080> before<00:04:11.670> with<00:04:12.670> the<00:04:12.849> clamping
