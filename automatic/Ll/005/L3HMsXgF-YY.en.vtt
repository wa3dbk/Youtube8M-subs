00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.590 
job for that um let's see the cord what
the<00:03:34.660> site<00:03:35.080> says<00:03:35.320> it<00:03:35.500> swivels<00:03:35.920> for<00:03:36.310> 360<00:03:37.270> degrees

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
the site says it swivels for 360 degrees

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.140 
the site says it swivels for 360 degrees
which<00:03:38.530> you<00:03:38.709> might<00:03:38.890> not<00:03:39.100> find<00:03:39.370> really<00:03:40.030> useful

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
which you might not find really useful

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.640 
which you might not find really useful
but<00:03:40.720> when<00:03:40.840> you're<00:03:40.989> doing<00:03:41.200> your<00:03:41.230> hair<00:03:41.530> and

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
but when you're doing your hair and

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.170 
but when you're doing your hair and
you're<00:03:41.770> all<00:03:41.980> different<00:03:42.370> places<00:03:42.610> and

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
you're all different places and

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.660 
you're all different places and
everything<00:03:44.020> it<00:03:44.260> won't<00:03:44.530> move<00:03:44.739> back<00:03:45.100> and<00:03:45.310> forth

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
everything it won't move back and forth

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.880 
everything it won't move back and forth
that<00:03:46.450> way<00:03:46.630> you<00:03:46.690> don't<00:03:46.810> get<00:03:47.050> tangled<00:03:47.230> up<00:03:47.500> inside

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
that way you don't get tangled up inside

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.570 
that way you don't get tangled up inside
your<00:03:48.700> flat<00:03:48.970> iron<00:03:49.000> cord<00:03:49.680> now<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:50.739> cords<00:03:51.160> really

your flat iron cord now the cords really

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.570 
your flat iron cord now the cords really
long<00:03:51.790> as<00:03:52.420> you<00:03:52.570> can<00:03:52.720> tell<00:03:53.160> still<00:03:54.160> over<00:03:54.310> there<00:03:54.520> a

long as you can tell still over there a

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.370 
long as you can tell still over there a

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
this site says which I'm not find really

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.500 
this site says which I'm not find really
useful<00:03:59.560> because<00:04:00.070> my<00:04:00.370> plug<00:04:00.640> is<00:04:00.760> right<00:04:00.940> here<00:04:01.300> but

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
useful because my plug is right here but

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.660 
useful because my plug is right here but
for<00:04:01.540> hairstylists<00:04:02.140> it<00:04:02.680> probably<00:04:03.040> is<00:04:03.160> useful

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
for hairstylists it probably is useful

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.880

it<00:04:04.630> heats<00:04:04.900> up<00:04:05.140> to<00:04:05.489> 370<00:04:06.489> degrees<00:04:06.610> and<00:04:07.560> it's<00:04:08.560> just

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
it heats up to 370 degrees and it's just

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.310 
it heats up to 370 degrees and it's just
that<00:04:09.130> heat<00:04:09.370> setting<00:04:09.790> now<00:04:10.150> one<00:04:10.390> of<00:04:10.420> the<00:04:10.600> cons<00:04:11.050> i

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
that heat setting now one of the cons i

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.380 
that heat setting now one of the cons i
have<00:04:11.530> about<00:04:11.770> cheese<00:04:12.459> i<00:04:12.760> don't<00:04:13.300> know<00:04:13.360> if

have about cheese i don't know if

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.610 
have about cheese i don't know if
they're<00:04:13.600> all<00:04:13.750> of<00:04:13.900> them<00:04:14.050> but<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.320> ones<00:04:14.500> that

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
they're all of them but the ones that

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.710 
they're all of them but the ones that
are<00:04:14.770> kind<00:04:15.310> of<00:04:15.340> like<00:04:15.489> this<00:04:15.730> there's<00:04:16.419> only<00:04:16.600> one

are kind of like this there's only one

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.930 
are kind of like this there's only one
heat<00:04:17.169> setting<00:04:17.560> I<00:04:17.739> don't<00:04:18.400> think<00:04:18.430> that's<00:04:18.700> really

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
heat setting I don't think that's really

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.599 
heat setting I don't think that's really
good<00:04:19.150> oh<00:04:19.330> I<00:04:19.390> don't<00:04:19.750> recommend<00:04:20.380> people<00:04:21.160> who

iron can do it can curl it can
straighten<00:04:37.390> of<00:04:37.540> course<00:04:37.750> it<00:04:38.530> can<00:04:38.830> flip<00:04:39.190> your

hair like above or underneath and it can

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.820 
hair like above or underneath and it can
also<00:04:43.540> crimp<00:04:43.990> you<00:04:44.170> can<00:04:44.320> crimp<00:04:44.530> it<00:04:44.620> by<00:04:44.770> just

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
also crimp you can crimp it by just

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.940 
also crimp you can crimp it by just
pulling<00:04:45.340> it<00:04:45.550> through<00:04:45.720> each<00:04:46.720> way<00:04:47.080> so<00:04:47.620> it<00:04:47.710> does

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
pulling it through each way so it does

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.690 
pulling it through each way so it does
do<00:04:48.190> multiple<00:04:48.610> things<00:04:49.710> it<00:04:50.710> just<00:04:50.770> has<00:04:51.100> a<00:04:51.310> simple

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
do multiple things it just has a simple

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.030 
do multiple things it just has a simple
on/off<00:04:52.210> switch<00:04:52.540> that's<00:04:52.870> in<00:04:53.200> the<00:04:53.320> center<00:04:53.650> so

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
on/off switch that's in the center so

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.700 
on/off switch that's in the center so
you<00:04:54.070> do<00:04:54.520> not<00:04:54.670> have<00:04:54.880> to<00:04:55.030> worry<00:04:55.210> about<00:04:55.710> actually

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
you do not have to worry about actually

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.080 
you do not have to worry about actually
turning<00:04:56.980> it<00:04:57.130> off<00:04:57.310> when<00:04:57.640> you're<00:04:57.760> doing<00:04:58.060> your

of here where the plates are does get

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.880 
of here where the plates are does get
warm<00:05:07.810> but<00:05:08.110> it<00:05:08.170> doesn't<00:05:08.410> get<00:05:08.470> hot<00:05:08.680> enough<00:05:08.770> to

you're curling your hair it actually

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.600 
you're curling your hair it actually
makes<00:05:12.700> it<00:05:12.820> a<00:05:12.910> lot<00:05:13.090> easier<00:05:13.150> to<00:05:13.750> do<00:05:14.100> um<00:05:15.100> what<00:05:15.430> else

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
makes it a lot easier to do um what else

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
can I talk about this oh it's an energy

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.930 
can I talk about this oh it's an energy
