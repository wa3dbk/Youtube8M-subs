00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:04.970
 hello to all of you so today I'm going to present you a 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.670
 little video 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.670
 in europe who rejects what was done these males 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.400
 but still working very very well for the moment on the 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:16.189
 on the front 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:17.609
 I took notes 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.960
 the protoss why because for this kind of tactics enough 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.400
 which means in celebration 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.849
 mass damage and rapid construction 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.890
 ndong what are the banks the trick c 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.439
 from the start 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:32.749
 so it's obviously a certain 

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:37.030
 on the map just two rallying points because the 4c ​​takes more than 

00:00:37.029 --> 00:00:40.029
 time of the blow it happens to miss 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.070
 so what to do at first these novels ccss voices like this ore 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.510
 in style that's what the novel does not take into account but 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.770
 directly in the opposing base 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.860
 while I did 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.280
 we see that cum 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.410
 the opposing base on the small slope for not that the braille opponent 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.740
 and then if I fall controversial it's the most boring for this type of tactic 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.090
 in place as they so quickly have the hours to come 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.880
 is to form good relays and the other one is hard enough a single 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.900
 other 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.900
 more more more formal April 4 in Strasbourg 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.780
 so I'm in 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.920
 information on a support I am very attached to my hair about the 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.560
 everything for a little player so 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.560
 to show that this tactic is accessible to all 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.310
 a pit filled with fishing and a bus ensuring that it would not go the time 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.550
 to do what scout pretty quickly and like that rant all his base 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.350
 it's a full-time parcel I'm doing a little tile is a little bit too much 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.540
 down I almost made me discover 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.700
 the thing is to sell either to eat well there the cliff 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.380
 why do not you see anything 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.689
 and he's shocked in a quiet little quiet place montferrand I'm going 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.730
 fuck me so far 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.280
 really at the top of the tip 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.970
 precisely because we would not forget a short space 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.450
 to go on sale 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.850
 I preferred to promise the teacher what what I intend to rely on 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.940
 what will happen easily and simply 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.080
 so I preferred to fuck in the corner I created my little deities 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.069
 tranquillou can please 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.879
 this requires creating a pylon 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:16.219
 to increase there 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:18.609
 possible of his notes 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:20.910
 cupid equals the bear 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.139
 little house 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:25.389
 humans and at the dominating desert market who do not know 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:31.569
 when I say I play strain but protoss but for this type of tactics this 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.539
 which means what usually I play 40% 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:37.799
 created by decree and direct to create the creation of afp 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:44.119
 we do not forget to play the little pups temporary departures on the 

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:47.499
 on the low-coast-north resumes to ride revitalize the creation more 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:51.089
 quick vcs so there I feared second pylons may the dog milk 

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:54.119
 because I did not move in the brain so I had bought% 

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:55.539
 damn Quebecois 

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:58.669
 so stewardship when leaving the headquarters recreate them direct 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:01.709
 and that as soon as possible I will create young people who quarrel banks 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.249
 well thought about making the decree 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:07.379
 what was thinking 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.379
 his words 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:14.059
 aguer crystal what do we do two 

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:17.009
 soulan make stronger more fun 

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:19.779
 the resources 

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:22.490
 that's what will make all the difference 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.029
 I fear a third pilot 

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:28.409
 for the creation of this lotto in March at the same time it is necessary to wear without 50 this 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:30.119
 morning makine 

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:33.119
 local expert return to France only 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:36.189
 ottmar first of all is done 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:39.290
 because I do and I do not know anyway we can not wait 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.009
 we do not forget the small temporal poucet 

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:45.189
 for creation to be faster 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:48.669
 so here's the title the temporary actress of a thing a Shiite etc the 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:50.999
 Protoss 

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:53.399
 he was lying 

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:55.680
 suffering avoid as a cheese cases 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.680
 what are not trained r that's good shit 

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:01.790
 club 3 kilos 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.429
 or may lose why a handballer points out 

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:05.590
 we could better 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.869
 the content what is manly axel 

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:12.249
 the simplistic showman is the video because I think we will go over 30 years 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:16.219
 when you see people switching to use it's 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.539
 what I wanted to do 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.859
 still post 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.819
 it is in this turf climate 

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:28.869
 if I'm wrong I think it's for the evolution of the treasurers 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.840
 or four articles 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.080
 or so I can already created messac zealots there he sends his seven 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.740
 hills above 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.970
 they give all their vcs and I told the globe 5 0 3 to hurt me it's okay 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.970
 sting could I kill them to be acquired after coop 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.330
 he succeeded in less sense pretty cool I think in the end I think 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.330
 found plot note but hey it's still the others under construction for 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.340
 that as it is always with native poultry that 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.229
 come in third which is very classic I complete my balance sheet is 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:57.360
 intact 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.650
 to the room now 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.650
 the team is obvious to have bought 36 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:06.319
 he pat me a little bit and discuss scene he's doing his little remy 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.069
 without family 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:11.009
 nokia still no moisture 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:13.979
 when I come across a payment I must say what is 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:15.809
 small pepper by scooter 

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:19.129
 evokes the units arriving from the airport what's going on 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:23.490
 so there he is inevitably imbued on this line he sometimes tells me caustic 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.830
 and anguished 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.830
 his vcs and poses the real valaisan and after 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.370
 it's small and all tastes 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.990
 othello of shakespeare 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.819
 in any case continue to send it will be too late always legs and the 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:40.080
 cssf neck 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.430
 not very very resistant 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.889
 really it's nice what to privas see who takes a mega brands 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:47.629
 conflicts entertain and direct 

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:51.339
 I thought to stay there a little nap after the fourth it will circulate 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:56.509
 at the same time the game is over what is the two previous 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.830
 once the rain was over it's no longer there necessarily force of 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.689
 repeat 

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:06.689
 his resources diminish in my opinion the crying a lot of resources 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.749
 and then these holocaust leaders 

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:11.900
 I'm happy to continue so here is 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.960
 nice little video 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.419
 that everyone can test mostly freely because the guys are not 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:21.419
 lights 

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:25.349
 Thursday the text passes with very short deadlines players because 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.389
 dirtyh not to believe it here that landed 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:33.389
 this video you bring days 

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:37.569
 the player in a good mood 

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:40.150
 for all those who are tired of being rejected 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.039
 like beasts 

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:46.020
 it's a little bit my case what when I say I know so I'm used to 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.099
 get fired 

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:52.279
 it's my turn to do 

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:55.430
 but listen he plays the rabbit very soon 3 

00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:59.199
 a nice little video 

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:00.119
 Hi Hi
