00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 welcome to simple math classes 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.049
 of university education 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.880
 in these classes will be discussed 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.980
 different subjects relating to 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.389
 disciplines that are taught in the area of 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.240
 mathematics in five children 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.400
 namely the subjects of analysis 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.160
 mathematics or else the feeling of 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.380
 thematic analysis calculation infinitesimal 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.210
 several different names for a 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.330
 discipline that does not fundamentally edge 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.640
 practically the same themes as for the 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.040
 alga other brother actress will also be 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.780
 other subjects to be approved and 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.480
 also statistical 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.640
 here also a small list 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.170
 on some subjects that will be 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.230
 used in these classes for example 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.420
 regarding the theory of the actress 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.480
 we will do the exact calculation 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.239
 building the inverse matrix calculations 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.940
 own events own characteristic 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.340
 matrix is relative to the 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.699
 we will give different kinds of beings 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.010
 business series and these metrics will be 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.799
 criteria for the convergence of 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.900
 serys the development in functions of 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:12.299
 functions by six powers such as 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:14.310
 now the tyler series also primitive 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.290
 we will study indirect permissible 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.750
 mediated by primitive parts solutions 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.880
 primitive rational oppression with 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.650
 trigonometric functions and some 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.720
 distributions related to the area of 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.100
 statistic with a curve in the pants 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.890
 normal distribution 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.380
 students curve student 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.790
 gustavo and also some tests of 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.530
 hypotheses and has confidence intervals 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.220
 related to these 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.100
 assignments would be a lot more issues 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.110
 that I could include in this list is by 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.070
 example, we'll also be a little bit 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.290
 of differential equations in terms of 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.140
 derivatives are also not tri-studied 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.450
 taken to functions in renan and many 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.329
 other subjects are being studied to 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.210
 over this set of videos 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.939
 linked to higher education 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.270
 I hope you enjoy the krahe videos in 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.270
 brief
