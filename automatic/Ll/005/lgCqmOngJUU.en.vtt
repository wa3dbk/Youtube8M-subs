00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.099
 basiq redstone tutorials for you and 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.250
 today I have a new one for you 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.990
 kind of how you can open your door 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.299
 get what you say but say here 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.430
 can get through and this time it is 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.170
 not with a prefer or for it is with 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.810
 is whole 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.449
 is very different something you hi what 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.150
 you never see yes or yes 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.150
 I think it's your use here 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.510
 a lot and the door opens as you do 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.860
 jump on it then close again 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.750
 so you get and move aside 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.290
 do i go go away go away 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.480
 yes this makes it very easy to watch 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.890
 and he will point you away if you point out 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.690
 many people jump for this 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.910
 they don't know this way okay you 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.379
 so explain how that works he is whole 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.570
 easy to use just in one 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.280
 year like this a perry because so be it or 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.680
 so and you just sit there grass 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.120
 side if you like the very many people 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.579
 would have no idea where you already are 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.290
 As might well have it your base 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.830
 way you can see a little bit of that 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.119
 we are still running from behind 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.930
 I'd just say that is hide 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.850
 just solve 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.740
 so no problem but then you can quite 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.110
 so easily by your goal your 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.250
 basic income I'm going to explain to you here 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.520
 how this week 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.110
 look below you put the torch more 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.340
 for this the block did the block that 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.130
 you should 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.280
 yes soil say a sack and like me 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.890

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.680

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.079
 I get a unit so away this one 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.229
 way to use it below and yes this is 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.829
 just this is your input this block if you 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.380
 want it or not and yes here you can 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.390
 Then with this output you can have fun 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.880
 do things and then I happen to have 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.780
 in this way i used it to 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.180
 activate this business 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.770
 and so you can easily go again 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.600

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.299
 yes use a new input that true 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.530
 a lot of people didn't know anything about it 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.540
 hope you enjoyed it 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.770
 delivery because yes you do not last that long 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.810
 so not that hard to explain 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.420
 but i like it a lot 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.250

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.069

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.300
