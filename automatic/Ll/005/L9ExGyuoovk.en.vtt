I'm going to spinning um
this<00:03:20.189> is<00:03:20.370> out<00:03:20.609> and<00:03:21.859> it<00:03:22.859> becomes<00:03:23.129> like<00:03:23.819> a<00:03:23.879> whole

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:24.689 
this is out and it becomes like a whole

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:29.210 
this is out and it becomes like a whole
flat<00:03:25.159> but<00:03:26.159> when<00:03:26.519> it<00:03:26.640> slows<00:03:26.819> down<00:03:27.439> this<00:03:28.439> goes<00:03:28.920> in

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
flat but when it slows down this goes in

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.660 
flat but when it slows down this goes in
which<00:03:29.640> becomes<00:03:30.060> a<00:03:30.209> sharp<00:03:31.220> so<00:03:32.220> now<00:03:32.370> I'm<00:03:32.459> going

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
which becomes a sharp so now I'm going

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:58.069 
which becomes a sharp so now I'm going
to<00:03:32.730> do<00:03:32.849> a<00:03:32.879> spin<00:03:33.329> now<00:03:42.500> we<00:03:43.500> go<00:03:55.189> and<00:03:56.189> now<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:57.079> final

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
to do a spin now we go and now the final

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:19.009 
to do a spin now we go and now the final
survive<00:03:59.269> changes<00:04:00.269> step<00:04:00.840> no<00:04:01.590> sharp

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:28.950
