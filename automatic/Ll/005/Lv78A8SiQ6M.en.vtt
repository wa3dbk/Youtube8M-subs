00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello everyone how about everything well 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.569
 welcome to techno slaves 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.610
 I am alex monras and in today's video 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.679
 let's see how to improve the speed of 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.120
 internet connection in windows 10 I'm 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.889
 sure that I'm not the only user of 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.960
 windows 10 you have noticed that your 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.000
 internet was a little slower than normal 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.390
 compared to when he was installed 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.410
 windows 8 8.1 or in my case windows 7 what 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.480
 true is that I quite like the 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.340
 result that is giving me windows 10 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.259
 I think the guys at Microsoft have 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.270
 done a very good job I like your 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.279
 design your response speed that already 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.740
 It surprised me considerably in 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.690
 windows 8.1 on windows 10 has been exceeded 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.520
 more than anything but it's also true that 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.650
 noticed as my internet speed 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.180
 had worsened enough then I 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.220
 these days I was wondering if 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.140
 really the problem could be mine 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.360
 maybe by the network card or by the 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.370
 ethernet cable even by the company or 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.470
 the central one that gives me internet or 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.480
 maybe the dns that are malfunctioning 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.190
 in that moment but thinking about it better 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.870
 I realized that it really turned out to be 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.910
 much chance that just at 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.100
 update to windows 10 my internet is 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.630
 I suddenly went slow then I 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.610
 I asked if the problem could be 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.080
 windows 10 what was it that could be 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.390
 causing that problem 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.310
 and I found it is a new 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.050
 option that they have added in windows 10 that 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.880
 basically it's about sharing the 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.680
 windows updates files 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.810
 10 that we have already downloaded in our 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.730
 system with other windows 10 users 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.170
 from all over the world so that they 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.360
 can download these updates 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.160
 much faster than usual 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.690
 you know when you download torrent files 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.760
 that you can configure the speed of 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.830
 upload to share the files that 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.630
 downloads with other people who also 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.340
 they are downloading it and so help you 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.230
 together to download a little more 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.700
 fast then it would be basically what 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.440
 same a file exchange network 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.360
 but in this case only the 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.220
 windows updates and I that 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.110
 you want me to tell you honestly not 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.120
 I find this option useful to me 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.100
 personally and I think everyone or the 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.660
 most of you will be with me 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.900
 it does not matter if you receive updates from 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.160
 microsoft in 5 that in 20 minutes but what 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.500
 that I do not care is to be sacrificing 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.810
 bandwidth by helping others 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.180
 users to download faster and that I 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.470
 internet is affected and that's why 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.330
 so then I'll 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.490
 indicate three simple steps so that 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.200
 you can deactivate this option and come back 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.000
 to enjoy your native speed of 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.230
 internet in the first place what are we going to 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.120
 to do is going to be 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.670
 to the windows 10 configuration menu 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.440
 once in the configuration menu 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.120
 we access update and security and 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.709
 then click on options 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.750
 Advanced tab in Windows 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.370
 update and finally we click on 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.260
 choose the way we want it to be 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.670
 deliver the updates as you see 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.230
 in my case it is disabled 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.150
 because I have made sure that it is so 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.340
 but by default the option is 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.560
 activated and set to share 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.049
 updates with all the equipment in 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.730
 the local network and internet equipment in 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.920
 general so the only thing that you have left 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.319
 to do is deactivate it completely or 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.329
 well if you are interested in the least because 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.010
 you can configure it to share 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.959
 updates with computers 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.010
 your local network but anyway 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.690
 I already tell you that it is not an option 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.250
 relevant that rather what are you going to 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.440
 noticing are going to be speed problems 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.849
 in your internet connection so 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.349
 nothing this has been all I hope that you 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.859
 have liked this video has been of 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.079
 utility 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.579
 If so, vote positively and 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.140
 share it on social networks to 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:08.640
 that all your friends and acquaintances 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.109
 can also enjoy this 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.379
 solution and see you in the next 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.379
 video
