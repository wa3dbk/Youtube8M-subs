them<00:02:26.200> all<00:02:26.350> get<00:02:26.860> them<00:02:27.010> all<00:02:27.130> on<00:02:27.160> there<00:02:27.579> they're

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
them all get them all on there they're

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:37.580 
them all get them all on there they're
not<00:02:27.760> going<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.090> be<00:02:28.239> lined<00:02:28.510> up<00:02:28.690> yet<00:02:29.100> and

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:44.540 

all<00:02:38.590> right

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.510 

yes<00:02:46.739> actually<00:02:47.739> I<00:02:47.770> picked<00:02:47.920> up<00:02:48.099> the<00:02:48.220> perfect

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
yes actually I picked up the perfect

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.430 
yes actually I picked up the perfect
number<00:02:48.640> of<00:02:48.849> frames<00:02:49.090> now<00:02:49.360> you<00:02:49.420> notice<00:02:50.020> that<00:02:50.170> all

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
number of frames now you notice that all

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.930 
number of frames now you notice that all
them<00:02:50.709> jumping<00:02:51.010> around<00:02:51.130> if<00:02:51.400> you<00:02:51.519> wind<00:02:51.730> it<00:02:51.819> up

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
them jumping around if you wind it up

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.110 
them jumping around if you wind it up
like<00:02:52.120> I<00:02:52.269> did<00:02:52.560> which<00:02:53.560> is<00:02:53.830> well<00:02:54.220> not<00:02:54.489> lined<00:02:54.790> up<00:02:54.970> at

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
like I did which is well not lined up at

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.729 
like I did which is well not lined up at
all<00:02:55.269> so<00:02:55.840> you're<00:02:55.959> gonna<00:02:56.080> go<00:02:56.230> to<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.410> second

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
all so you're gonna go to the second

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.009 
all so you're gonna go to the second
frame<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:57.760> turn<00:02:58.000> on<00:02:58.150> your<00:02:58.180> onion<00:02:58.690> skinning

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
frame and turn on your onion skinning

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.930 
frame and turn on your onion skinning
tool<00:02:59.290> and<00:02:59.560> you're<00:03:00.190> gonna<00:03:00.280> see<00:03:00.519> a<00:03:00.550> series<00:03:00.849> of

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
tool and you're gonna see a series of

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:01.470 
tool and you're gonna see a series of
frames

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
frames

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.320 
frames
I<00:03:01.510> usually<00:03:02.110> just<00:03:02.290> set<00:03:03.220> it<00:03:03.310> up<00:03:03.430> to<00:03:03.700> only<00:03:03.880> show

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
I usually just set it up to only show

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.830 
I usually just set it up to only show
the<00:03:05.200> frame<00:03:05.500> you're<00:03:05.709> on<00:03:05.860> and<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:07.180> frame<00:03:07.420> before

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
the frame you're on and the frame before

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.880 
the frame you're on and the frame before
it<00:03:08.700> so<00:03:09.700> all<00:03:09.880> you<00:03:10.030> see<00:03:10.269> is<00:03:10.480> frame<00:03:10.989> to<00:03:11.230> frame<00:03:11.560> one

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
it so all you see is frame to frame one

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.360 
it so all you see is frame to frame one
and<00:03:12.100> I'm<00:03:12.489> frame<00:03:12.760> three<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.090> be<00:03:13.150> frame<00:03:13.390> to<00:03:14.370> so

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
and I'm frame three to be frame to so

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.820 
and I'm frame three to be frame to so
you're<00:03:15.580> just<00:03:15.640> gonna<00:03:15.880> do<00:03:16.540> your<00:03:16.690> best<00:03:16.900> at<00:03:17.200> lining

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
you're just gonna do your best at lining

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.059 
you're just gonna do your best at lining
it<00:03:17.920> up<00:03:17.980> like<00:03:18.220> that<00:03:18.250> and<00:03:18.489> then<00:03:18.730> well<00:03:19.120> I<00:03:20.069> usually

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
it up like that and then well I usually

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.830 
it up like that and then well I usually
do<00:03:22.000> this<00:03:22.349> to<00:03:23.349> get<00:03:23.620> it<00:03:23.769> lined<00:03:23.980> up<00:03:24.220> and<00:03:24.459> like

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
do this to get it lined up and like

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.360 
do this to get it lined up and like
almost<00:03:25.840> perfectly<00:03:28.860> at<00:03:29.860> first<00:03:30.130> you're<00:03:30.280> going

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
almost perfectly at first you're going

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.640 
almost perfectly at first you're going
to<00:03:30.430> line<00:03:30.640> up<00:03:30.670> like<00:03:31.060> if<00:03:31.299> all<00:03:31.989> the<00:03:32.170> heads<00:03:32.380> on<00:03:32.560> the

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
to line up like if all the heads on the

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.000 
to line up like if all the heads on the
character<00:03:33.069> are<00:03:33.160> the<00:03:33.280> same<00:03:33.519> you<00:03:34.450> just<00:03:34.830> for<00:03:35.830> me

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
character are the same you just for me

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.099 
character are the same you just for me
in<00:03:36.310> a<00:03:36.610> movie<00:03:36.910> clip<00:03:37.030> I<00:03:37.269> would<00:03:37.330> line<00:03:37.630> it<00:03:37.780> up<00:03:37.900> by

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
in a movie clip I would line it up by

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:39.330 
in a movie clip I would line it up by
the<00:03:38.170> heads<00:03:38.470> and<00:03:38.769> you're<00:03:38.920> gonna<00:03:39.010> notice<00:03:39.160> that

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
the heads and you're gonna notice that

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.460 
the heads and you're gonna notice that
the<00:03:39.459> feet<00:03:39.700> aren't<00:03:39.940> lined<00:03:40.209> up<00:03:40.390> so<00:03:41.140> you<00:03:41.230> line<00:03:41.440> up

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
the feet aren't lined up so you line up

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.920 
the feet aren't lined up so you line up
the<00:03:41.620> head<00:03:41.829> and<00:03:41.980> then<00:03:42.070> just<00:03:42.359> line<00:03:43.359> up<00:03:43.390> the<00:03:43.720> foot

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
the head and then just line up the foot

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.599 
the head and then just line up the foot
level<00:03:45.120> which<00:03:46.120> would<00:03:46.500> line<00:03:47.500> that<00:03:47.769> part<00:03:48.070> up<00:03:48.220> on

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
level which would line that part up on

00:03:48.609 --> 00:04:00.460 
level which would line that part up on
there<00:03:49.150> and<00:03:53.250> kind<00:03:54.250> of<00:03:54.310> starts<00:03:54.609> it<00:03:54.700> off

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.720 

I'm<00:04:01.470> just<00:04:01.740> going<00:04:01.890> to<00:04:01.920> do<00:04:02.040> this<00:04:02.190> twice<00:04:02.400> and<00:04:02.640> then

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
I'm just going to do this twice and then

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.300 
I'm just going to do this twice and then
well<00:04:04.310> you're<00:04:05.310> going<00:04:05.400> to<00:04:05.460> get<00:04:05.640> the<00:04:05.760> point<00:04:06.030> of

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
well you're going to get the point of

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.060 
well you're going to get the point of
how<00:04:08.310> to<00:04:08.370> line<00:04:08.670> it<00:04:08.700> up<00:04:09.170> then<00:04:10.170> I'm<00:04:10.740> just<00:04:10.860> going<00:04:11.040> to

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
how to line it up then I'm just going to

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.950 
how to line it up then I'm just going to
pause<00:04:11.310> it<00:04:11.340> and<00:04:11.730> do<00:04:11.910> the<00:04:12.030> rest<00:04:12.270> so<00:04:12.600> I<00:04:12.630> don't<00:04:12.870> have

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:12.960 
pause it and do the rest so I don't have

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.090 
pause it and do the rest so I don't have
to<00:04:13.050> waste<00:04:13.260> any<00:04:13.440> film<00:04:13.830> or<00:04:14.670> well<00:04:15.980> duration<00:04:16.980> of

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
to waste any film or well duration of

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:24.350 
to waste any film or well duration of
tape<00:04:17.840> and<00:04:19.520> I<00:04:21.410> think<00:04:22.410> that's<00:04:22.650> lined<00:04:22.920> up<00:04:23.190> no<00:04:24.180> it's

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
tape and I think that's lined up no it's

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:32.749 
tape and I think that's lined up no it's
not

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:32.759 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:35.040 

all<00:04:33.759> right<00:04:33.909> now<00:04:34.209> that<00:04:34.449> sign<00:04:34.719> up<00:04:34.869> and<00:04:34.959> then

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
all right now that sign up and then

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.299 
all right now that sign up and then
you'll<00:04:35.199> add<00:04:35.319> seat<00:04:36.089> okay<00:04:37.800> all<00:04:38.800> right<00:04:38.919> now<00:04:39.219> I'm

00:04:39.299 --> 00:04:39.309 
you'll add seat okay all right now I'm

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:41.489 
you'll add seat okay all right now I'm
going<00:04:39.429> to<00:04:39.489> pause<00:04:39.669> it<00:04:39.699> real<00:04:40.029> quick<00:04:40.269> and<00:04:40.379> do<00:04:41.379> the

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:41.499 
going to pause it real quick and do the

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:48.499 
going to pause it real quick and do the
rest<00:04:41.619> of<00:04:41.830> it<00:04:43.769> okay<00:04:45.479> well<00:04:46.479> I<00:04:46.509> just<00:04:46.599> finished

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:48.509 
rest of it okay well I just finished

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:50.879 
rest of it okay well I just finished
lining<00:04:49.509> up<00:04:49.659> all<00:04:49.809> characters<00:04:50.289> now<00:04:50.619> it<00:04:50.769> runs

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
lining up all characters now it runs

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.489 
lining up all characters now it runs
pretty<00:04:51.189> smoothly<00:04:51.659> if<00:04:52.659> you<00:04:52.899> lined<00:04:53.080> it<00:04:53.229> up<00:04:53.319> the

00:04:53.489 --> 00:04:53.499 
pretty smoothly if you lined it up the

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:55.529 
pretty smoothly if you lined it up the
exact<00:04:53.769> way<00:04:53.949> I<00:04:53.979> did<00:04:54.279> and<00:04:54.489> use<00:04:54.879> the<00:04:55.059> same<00:04:55.269> sprite

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:55.539 
exact way I did and use the same sprite

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:56.850 
exact way I did and use the same sprite
it's<00:04:55.779> going<00:04:55.959> to<00:04:56.019> look<00:04:56.080> pretty<00:04:56.139> much<00:04:56.589> exactly

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
it's going to look pretty much exactly

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.749 
it's going to look pretty much exactly
like<00:04:57.339> this<00:04:58.589> so<00:04:59.589> now<00:04:59.739> when<00:04:59.979> you<00:05:00.159> walk<00:05:00.369> I<00:05:00.610> mean

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:00.759 
like this so now when you walk I mean

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:03.179 
like this so now when you walk I mean
kind<00:05:00.939> of<00:05:00.969> look<00:05:01.089> like<00:05:01.209> that<00:05:01.330> but<00:05:02.199> um<00:05:02.439> if<00:05:02.889> you<00:05:03.069> go

00:05:03.179 --> 00:05:03.189 
kind of look like that but um if you go

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:05.129 
kind of look like that but um if you go
to<00:05:03.249> your<00:05:03.369> main<00:05:03.519> timeline<00:05:03.819> and<00:05:04.300> you<00:05:04.449> have<00:05:04.749> your

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:05.139 
to your main timeline and you have your

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:06.749 
to your main timeline and you have your
character<00:05:05.379> dropped<00:05:06.129> on<00:05:06.309> the<00:05:06.399> main<00:05:06.550> timeline

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:06.759 
character dropped on the main timeline

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:09.600 
character dropped on the main timeline
or<00:05:07.749> otherwise<00:05:08.499> another<00:05:08.800> way<00:05:09.009> to<00:05:09.069> get<00:05:09.249> it<00:05:09.429> from

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
or otherwise another way to get it from

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.459 
or otherwise another way to get it from
your<00:05:09.759> library<00:05:10.209> is<00:05:10.330> to<00:05:10.509> just<00:05:10.719> click<00:05:11.019> and<00:05:11.229> drag

00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:11.469 
your library is to just click and drag

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:15.089 
your library is to just click and drag
one<00:05:11.619> out<00:05:11.800> like<00:05:12.009> that<00:05:12.839> but<00:05:13.839> when<00:05:14.800> you<00:05:14.889> play

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:15.099 
one out like that but when you play

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:17.100 
one out like that but when you play
you'll<00:05:15.339> notice<00:05:15.580> that<00:05:15.699> he<00:05:15.789> goes<00:05:16.110> extremely

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
you'll notice that he goes extremely

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:24.529 
you'll notice that he goes extremely
fast<00:05:17.999> when<00:05:18.999> uh<00:05:19.949> when<00:05:20.949> you<00:05:21.069> play<00:05:21.279> it<00:05:21.869> when<00:05:22.869> well

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:24.539 
fast when uh when you play it when well

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:27.119 
fast when uh when you play it when well
my<00:05:25.539> on<00:05:25.899> screen<00:05:26.289> cameras<00:05:26.619> recording<00:05:27.009> if

00:05:27.119 --> 00:05:27.129 
my on screen cameras recording if

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:31.169 
my on screen cameras recording if
they're<00:05:27.309> at<00:05:27.519> 15<00:05:28.119> frames<00:05:28.360> a<00:05:28.599> second<00:05:28.989> and<00:05:30.179> my

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:31.179 
they're at 15 frames a second and my

00:05:31.179 --> 00:05:33.569 
they're at 15 frames a second and my
frame<00:05:31.509> rates<00:05:31.749> 30<00:05:31.989> so<00:05:32.679> it<00:05:32.889> probably<00:05:33.309> looks

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:33.579 
frame rates 30 so it probably looks

00:05:33.579 --> 00:05:38.399 
frame rates 30 so it probably looks
weird<00:05:33.909> but<00:05:34.749> um<00:05:36.389> another<00:05:37.389> thought<00:05:37.749> went<00:05:38.199> on

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:38.409 
weird but um another thought went on

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:41.909 
weird but um another thought went on
using<00:05:39.399> sprites<00:05:39.759> on<00:05:40.179> flash<00:05:40.779> is<00:05:41.139> that<00:05:41.439> um<00:05:41.619> if

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
using sprites on flash is that um if

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:43.439 
using sprites on flash is that um if
you're<00:05:42.189> making<00:05:42.519> a<00:05:42.550> movie<00:05:42.819> clip<00:05:42.969> out<00:05:43.240> of<00:05:43.360> them

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 
you're making a movie clip out of them

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:46.649 
you're making a movie clip out of them
you<00:05:44.439> don't<00:05:44.649> want<00:05:44.829> to<00:05:45.279> rescale<00:05:46.059> the<00:05:46.329> sprites

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:46.659 
you don't want to rescale the sprites

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:48.719 
you don't want to rescale the sprites
before<00:05:47.050> you're<00:05:47.169> done<00:05:47.319> animating<00:05:47.709> it<00:05:48.099> but

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:48.729 
before you're done animating it but

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:50.219 
before you're done animating it but
after<00:05:49.059> you<00:05:49.149> have<00:05:49.269> the<00:05:49.360> movie<00:05:49.629> clip<00:05:49.869> you<00:05:50.019> can

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229 
after you have the movie clip you can

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:51.959 
after you have the movie clip you can
scale<00:05:50.499> it<00:05:50.679> to<00:05:50.709> whatever<00:05:50.949> size<00:05:51.159> you<00:05:51.519> want<00:05:51.759> and

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:51.969 
scale it to whatever size you want and

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:55.019 
scale it to whatever size you want and
play<00:05:52.869> it<00:05:53.249> because<00:05:54.249> it<00:05:54.519> will<00:05:54.610> resize

00:05:55.019 --> 00:05:55.029 
play it because it will resize

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:58.709 
play it because it will resize
everything<00:05:55.300> inside<00:05:55.929> of<00:05:55.990> it<00:05:56.169> and<00:05:57.569> well<00:05:58.569> the

00:05:58.709 --> 00:05:58.719 
everything inside of it and well the

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:00.559 
everything inside of it and well the
final<00:05:59.110> thing<00:05:59.349> that<00:05:59.379> you're<00:05:59.709> going<00:05:59.800> to<00:05:59.889> do<00:06:00.039> with

00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:00.569 
final thing that you're going to do with

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:04.230 
final thing that you're going to do with
sprite<00:06:01.569> animating<00:06:02.050> is<00:06:02.199> slowing<00:06:03.129> it<00:06:03.219> down<00:06:03.279> at<00:06:03.819> a

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
sprite animating is slowing it down at a

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.649 
sprite animating is slowing it down at a
high<00:06:04.509> frame<00:06:04.809> rate<00:06:05.050> which<00:06:05.829> is<00:06:05.979> just<00:06:06.249> going<00:06:07.179> in

00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:07.659 
high frame rate which is just going in

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:10.649 
high frame rate which is just going in
between<00:06:08.229> every<00:06:08.559> frame<00:06:08.889> and<00:06:09.599> inserting<00:06:10.599> a

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:10.659 
between every frame and inserting a

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:15.149 
between every frame and inserting a
frame<00:06:11.019> or<00:06:11.949> just<00:06:12.909> pressing<00:06:13.509> f5<00:06:14.110> to<00:06:14.589> save<00:06:14.860> some

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:15.159 
frame or just pressing f5 to save some

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:17.570 
frame or just pressing f5 to save some
time

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.990
