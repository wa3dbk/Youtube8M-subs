00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.179
 hello friends with you Anton 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.250
 Dyachenko 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.830
 and in this video I will tell you how and 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.730
 go into windows 7 safe mode and 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.000
 windows 8 and so go to safe mode 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:19.490
 windows 7 can be very simple for this 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.560
 turn on the computer and start pressing 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.439
 f8 key 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.660
 here are modern systems by pressing 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:33.570
 this key, the pickup pops up a window 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:36.899
 with a selection of sources from which you can 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:41.670
 boot for example hard disk 9 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:44.100
 private drives usb and others 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.020
 devices you choose a hard drive on 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.280
 which your operating room is installed 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:54.629
 system press enter and continue 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:58.410
 press f8 then the window will come out here 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.239
 something like this in which 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:06.270
 you select safe mode 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:09.560
 It looks like windows 8 says that also 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.030
 You can use f8 to boot into 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.979
 safe mode but I don't 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:20.009
 happened here is therefore 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:23.900
 use others the same way 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:31.770
 effective means and so for this 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:36.360
 let's go windows 8 in we will call the utility 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:43.110
 run windows 8 for this i windows 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:46.229
 8 you press windows x here are windows 7 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:50.729
 you can open the start menu and select 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:55.979
 you can do this as well this utility 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:02:03.229
 find windows 8 search so we 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:03.229
 opened execute and write m with config 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:15.890
 music and click render opens 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.410
 system configuration window 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:23.120
 we are interested in the loading tab field 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.660
 boot options checkbox 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.709
 safe mode and. worth the minimum 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:35.780
 loading ie it will be ours 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:37.510
 safe mode we push the beech and not 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.100
 show them need to press a button 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.200
 reboot after reboot 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.310
 computer machines do not need anything 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:50.570
 click boot in safe mode 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:52.820
 so exit without rebooting but he and 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.870
 next time boot in secure 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:59.330
 the mode for this is again necessary 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.850
 execute and we sconfig go to the tab 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.459
 download and uncheck this safe 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.470
 mode 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:11.480
 after that the computer should 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:15.620
 boot in normal mode and so what 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:18.670
 more options there is a boot in safe 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.670
 mode for windows 8 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.670
 the easiest option is to use 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.670
 utility 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:36.500
 take it is called but u and the tuner and 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:40.070
 download the archive unzip it so here 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.970
 he and run for his 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.350
 go in daddy for your bit 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:49.190
 not how to look at bit depth 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:53.600
 operating system is very simple from 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:58.489
 right button on the way computer in 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:00.410
 main menu start and properties here 4 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:04.790
 bit operating system 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:09.650
 same thing you can windows 8 by 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:12.829
 find select search and write computer 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.850
 press the right mouse button on it and 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:19.280
 select properties below 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:22.010
 This same itself look lewd its 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.960
 operating system in this case 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:31.120
 I'm 64 digits 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:35.600
 I click run this program here 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:39.460
 i need to set 1 checkbox not 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:44.740
 was advanced absence of boot menu 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.740
 then they need to click apply and 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:52.580
 reboot the program when 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.620
 the system will restart 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.180
 window in which you can use 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:00.110
 digital buttons 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:03.020
 select the appropriate mode let's say 4 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:07.460
 it's safe and boot into 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:09.380
 safe mode and so how to boot 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.080
 in safe mode we are with you 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:16.700
 figured out what to do now 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:19.370
 after loading in this mode and so on 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:22.610
 first you can alternately run 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:25.820
 programs from your startup folder are those 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:29.360
 which you load by default 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:33.680
 with windows am you load one 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.300
 Look, the system does not hang like this 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.820
 the way you 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:41.090
 by exception you can find this 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.220
 program which is due to which everything 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.920
 hangs 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:49.150
 either cyclic reboot 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:52.360
 option number two also happens 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:58.760
 reliable is to take advantage 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:06:02.419
 system recovery restore 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:04.970
 windows 7 system is like this 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:06.930
 image search windows 8 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.300
 In the same way 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:15.470
 choose system recovery 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:22.889
 click next and select 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:28.740
 restore point to which you are 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:29.340
 want to roll back click further ready 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.590
 and 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:35.100
 the system will recover after 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.759
 what for try boots in the usual 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.940
 mode 

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:41.669
 if it doesn't help come back to 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:46.289
 safe mode and roll back to 

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:50.300
 earlier restore point on 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:54.320
 this is all today I wish all 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:57.630
 worked as usual 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:00.169
 with you was Anton Dyachenko see you in 

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.169
