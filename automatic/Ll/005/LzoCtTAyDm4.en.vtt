00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.600 
would have loved to have seen them do a
DFS<00:02:50.410> in<00:02:50.769> here<00:02:50.920> but<00:02:51.070> again<00:02:51.220> that's<00:02:51.370> just<00:02:51.430> my

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
DFS in here but again that's just my

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.830 
DFS in here but again that's just my
preference<00:02:51.910> that<00:02:52.330> would<00:02:52.420> be<00:02:52.480> that<00:02:52.600> palm

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
preference that would be that palm

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.660 
preference that would be that palm
slider<00:02:53.320> in<00:02:53.500> a<00:02:53.530> landing<00:02:53.890> zone<00:02:53.920> and<00:02:54.250> then<00:02:54.519> moving

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
slider in a landing zone and then moving

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
slider in a landing zone and then moving
up<00:02:54.850> the<00:02:54.970> out<00:02:55.060> scene<00:02:55.300> they<00:02:55.420> seem<00:02:55.570> to<00:02:55.630> have

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
up the out scene they seem to have

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.210 
up the out scene they seem to have
captured<00:02:55.959> it<00:02:56.230> pretty<00:02:56.410> well<00:02:56.560> with<00:02:57.040> a<00:02:57.070> little

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
captured it pretty well with a little

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.890 
captured it pretty well with a little
bit<00:02:57.400> more<00:02:57.550> protection<00:02:57.760> getting<00:02:58.690> close<00:02:58.870> to

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
bit more protection getting close to

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.150 
bit more protection getting close to
that<00:02:59.050> two<00:02:59.230> hundred<00:02:59.500> dollar<00:02:59.650> mark<00:02:59.890> again<00:03:00.130> I

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
that two hundred dollar mark again I

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.710 
that two hundred dollar mark again I
could<00:03:00.340> use<00:03:00.610> a<00:03:00.640> little<00:03:00.970> bit<00:03:01.150> more<00:03:01.300> leather<00:03:01.540> on

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
could use a little bit more leather on

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.240 
could use a little bit more leather on
this<00:03:01.840> glove<00:03:02.050> but<00:03:02.350> am<00:03:02.500> nitpicking<00:03:02.860> because<00:03:03.160> at
