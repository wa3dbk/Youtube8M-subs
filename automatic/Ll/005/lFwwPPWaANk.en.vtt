00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
look at the ace of spades and the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.600 
look at the ace of spades and the
Joker's<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.780> ace<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:46.170> spades<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.829> pretty<00:01:47.310> cool

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
Joker's the ace of spades is pretty cool

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.420 
Joker's the ace of spades is pretty cool
it's<00:01:47.909> very<00:01:48.390> similar<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.649> back<00:01:49.979> design

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
it's very similar to the back design

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.719 
it's very similar to the back design
with<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.320> illusion<00:01:52.320> which<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.189> really<00:01:53.460> neat

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
with that illusion which is really neat

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.120 
with that illusion which is really neat
and<00:01:53.970> in<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.750> center<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.170> have<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.680> skull

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
and in the center you have the skull

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.490 
and in the center you have the skull
court<00:01:56.369> logo<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.750> looks<00:01:57.990> pretty<00:01:58.200> cool

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
court logo so that looks pretty cool

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.100 
court logo so that looks pretty cool
definitely<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.520> new<00:01:59.969> idea<00:02:00.509> with<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.840> deck<00:02:01.079> of

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
definitely a new idea with a deck of

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.520 
definitely a new idea with a deck of
cards<00:02:01.430> now<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.490> Joker's<00:02:03.060> are<00:02:03.350> identical<00:02:04.350> I

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
cards now the Joker's are identical I

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.889 
cards now the Joker's are identical I
really<00:02:05.369> really<00:02:06.090> think<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.479> would<00:02:06.630> have<00:02:06.750> been

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
really really think it would have been

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.480 
really really think it would have been
an<00:02:07.140> easy<00:02:07.740> nice<00:02:08.729> looking<00:02:09.119> reveal<00:02:09.690> if<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.259> was

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
an easy nice looking reveal if it was

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.690 
an easy nice looking reveal if it was
put<00:02:10.670> in<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:11.060> eye<00:02:11.300> but<00:02:12.290> they<00:02:12.710> didn't<00:02:13.250> I<00:02:13.370> think

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
put in the eye but they didn't I think

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.340 
put in the eye but they didn't I think
it<00:02:13.790> would<00:02:13.910> have<00:02:14.030> been<00:02:14.150> really<00:02:14.540> neat<00:02:14.900> if<00:02:15.140> they

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
it would have been really neat if they

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.350 
it would have been really neat if they
did<00:02:15.680> because<00:02:16.340> that<00:02:16.520> just<00:02:16.700> would<00:02:17.030> have<00:02:17.120> been<00:02:17.330> a

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
did because that just would have been a

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.870 
did because that just would have been a
really<00:02:17.690> cool<00:02:18.020> reveal<00:02:18.440> but<00:02:19.100> the<00:02:19.250> Joker<00:02:19.520> is

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
really cool reveal but the Joker is

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.390 
really cool reveal but the Joker is
really<00:02:20.270> cool<00:02:20.510> it's<00:02:20.720> got<00:02:20.840> a<00:02:21.200> very<00:02:21.590> very<00:02:22.130> nice

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
really cool it's got a very very nice

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.720 
really cool it's got a very very nice
design<00:02:22.910> of<00:02:23.150> an<00:02:23.810> eye<00:02:24.050> peeking<00:02:24.620> through<00:02:24.950> some

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
design of an eye peeking through some

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.450 
design of an eye peeking through some
sort<00:02:25.970> of<00:02:26.290> hole<00:02:27.290> maybe<00:02:27.680> in<00:02:27.950> a<00:02:28.040> piece<00:02:28.250> of<00:02:28.280> paper

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
sort of hole maybe in a piece of paper

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.850 
sort of hole maybe in a piece of paper
or<00:02:28.850> something<00:02:29.240> but<00:02:30.050> it's<00:02:30.200> a<00:02:30.290> really<00:02:30.500> cool

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
or something but it's a really cool

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.250 
or something but it's a really cool
design<00:02:31.130> and<00:02:31.970> it<00:02:32.060> looks<00:02:32.270> like<00:02:32.450> it<00:02:32.600> was<00:02:32.720> drawn<00:02:33.050> by

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
design and it looks like it was drawn by

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.770 
design and it looks like it was drawn by
hand<00:02:33.530> which<00:02:33.860> is<00:02:34.010> neat<00:02:34.220> now<00:02:35.180> we'll<00:02:35.330> take<00:02:35.480> a<00:02:35.540> look

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
hand which is neat now we'll take a look

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.920 
hand which is neat now we'll take a look
at<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.290> number<00:02:36.890> cards<00:02:37.450> this<00:02:38.450> is<00:02:38.630> pretty<00:02:38.840> much

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
at the number cards this is pretty much

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.230 
at the number cards this is pretty much
a<00:02:39.080> fully<00:02:39.470> custom<00:02:39.980> deck<00:02:40.220> which<00:02:40.460> is<00:02:40.490> great<00:02:40.940> the

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
a fully custom deck which is great the

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.840 
a fully custom deck which is great the
indices<00:02:41.750> are<00:02:41.810> custom<00:02:42.650> and<00:02:42.890> as<00:02:43.430> you<00:02:43.640> can<00:02:43.820> see

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
indices are custom and as you can see

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.510 
indices are custom and as you can see
the<00:02:44.150> pips<00:02:44.450> are<00:02:44.750> as<00:02:45.020> well<00:02:45.320> and<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.950> pips<00:02:46.190> have

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
the pips are as well and the pips have

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.660 
the pips are as well and the pips have
an<00:02:46.820> illusion<00:02:47.420> too<00:02:47.660> and<00:02:47.960> the<00:02:48.680> illusion<00:02:49.100> is<00:02:49.220> very

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
an illusion too and the illusion is very

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.970 
an illusion too and the illusion is very
similar<00:02:50.000> to<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.390> ace<00:02:50.750> of<00:02:50.960> spades<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:51.440> the

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
similar to the ace of spades and the

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.810 
similar to the ace of spades and the
back<00:02:52.190> design<00:02:52.580> so<00:02:53.240> there<00:02:53.450> are<00:02:53.480> your<00:02:54.020> hearts<00:02:54.470> and

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
back design so there are your hearts and

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:01.030 
back design so there are your hearts and
we'll<00:02:55.820> take<00:02:56.000> a<00:02:56.030> look<00:02:56.270> at<00:02:56.570> the<00:02:56.810> clubs<00:02:57.940> and<00:03:00.040> here

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
we'll take a look at the clubs and here

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:07.680 
we'll take a look at the clubs and here
are<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.550> diamonds<00:03:02.420> and<00:03:04.870> here<00:03:05.870> are<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:06.580> spades

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
are the diamonds and here are the spades

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.410 
are the diamonds and here are the spades
now<00:03:08.690> another<00:03:08.990> thing<00:03:09.110> is<00:03:09.590> that<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.760> indices

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
now another thing is that the indices

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.020 
now another thing is that the indices
are<00:03:11.480> very<00:03:12.200> very<00:03:12.590> close<00:03:12.920> to<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:13.250> edge<00:03:13.430> which<00:03:13.850> is

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
are very very close to the edge which is

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.140 
are very very close to the edge which is
nice<00:03:14.330> and<00:03:14.690> you'll<00:03:15.470> see<00:03:15.950> that<00:03:16.160> when<00:03:16.430> i<00:03:16.700> get<00:03:16.850> into

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
nice and you'll see that when i get into

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.970 
nice and you'll see that when i get into
the<00:03:17.270> handling<00:03:17.840> because<00:03:18.020> they<00:03:18.290> show<00:03:18.560> in<00:03:18.860> the

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
the handling because they show in the

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.420 
the handling because they show in the
fans<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:20.450> Corcoran's<00:03:21.050> have<00:03:21.260> silver<00:03:21.770> and<00:03:22.010> gold

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
fans the Corcoran's have silver and gold

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.700 
fans the Corcoran's have silver and gold
metallic<00:03:22.670> ink<00:03:23.240> which<00:03:23.540> is<00:03:23.720> very<00:03:24.050> nice<00:03:24.350> and

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:24.710 
metallic ink which is very nice and

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.250 
metallic ink which is very nice and
that's<00:03:25.670> just<00:03:25.820> a<00:03:26.090> nice<00:03:26.270> little<00:03:26.300> subtle

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
that's just a nice little subtle

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.580 
that's just a nice little subtle
addition<00:03:27.890> to<00:03:28.100> the<00:03:28.190> deck<00:03:28.430> and<00:03:28.730> the<00:03:29.660> design<00:03:30.260> of

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
addition to the deck and the design of

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.030 
addition to the deck and the design of
the<00:03:30.860> core<00:03:31.100> cards<00:03:31.400> is<00:03:32.290> standard<00:03:33.290> but<00:03:33.800> they<00:03:33.920> have

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
the core cards is standard but they have

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.400 
the core cards is standard but they have
a<00:03:34.070> black<00:03:34.430> background<00:03:34.790> and<00:03:35.360> the<00:03:35.810> colors<00:03:36.200> are

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
changed and they have that silver

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.530 
changed and they have that silver
metallic<00:03:39.140> ink<00:03:39.800> which<00:03:40.100> looks<00:03:40.430> really<00:03:41.090> really

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
metallic ink which looks really really

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.200 
metallic ink which looks really really
nice<00:03:41.750> and<00:03:42.110> as<00:03:42.500> you<00:03:42.650> can<00:03:42.800> see<00:03:42.830> the<00:03:43.100> pips<00:03:43.370> are<00:03:43.730> the

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.210 
nice and as you can see the pips are the

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.930 
nice and as you can see the pips are the
same<00:03:44.480> as<00:03:44.690> the<00:03:44.810> ones<00:03:45.020> on<00:03:45.380> the<00:03:45.670> number<00:03:46.670> cards

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
same as the ones on the number cards

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.120 
same as the ones on the number cards
except<00:03:47.300> for<00:03:47.750> the<00:03:47.840> color<00:03:48.020> so<00:03:48.710> that's<00:03:48.890> really

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
except for the color so that's really

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.080 
except for the color so that's really
cool<00:03:49.520> here<00:03:50.480> is<00:03:50.750> your<00:03:50.780> queen<00:03:51.650> and<00:03:52.010> they<00:03:52.910> all

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
cool here is your queen and they all

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.720 
cool here is your queen and they all
have<00:03:53.120> the<00:03:53.480> same<00:03:53.720> color<00:03:54.260> scheme<00:03:54.500> the<00:03:54.980> hearts

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
have the same color scheme the hearts

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.280 
have the same color scheme the hearts
and<00:03:55.880> diamonds<00:03:56.030> have<00:03:56.420> the<00:03:56.570> same<00:03:56.780> color<00:03:57.080> scheme

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
and diamonds have the same color scheme

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.850 
and diamonds have the same color scheme
and<00:03:57.740> then<00:03:57.950> as<00:03:58.190> you<00:03:58.760> can<00:03:58.790> see<00:03:59.120> these<00:03:59.300> spades

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
and then as you can see these spades

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.400 
and then as you can see these spades
have<00:04:00.860> gold<00:04:01.400> instead<00:04:01.760> of<00:04:02.000> silver<00:04:02.390> and<00:04:02.510> that

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
have gold instead of silver and that

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.460 
have gold instead of silver and that
gold<00:04:04.250> is<00:04:04.520> metallic<00:04:04.970> ink<00:04:05.300> which<00:04:05.570> looks<00:04:05.900> really

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
gold is metallic ink which looks really

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.890 
gold is metallic ink which looks really
really<00:04:06.950> nice<00:04:07.160> and<00:04:07.430> it<00:04:07.550> gives<00:04:07.730> it<00:04:07.880> a<00:04:08.090> nice<00:04:08.480> shine

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
really nice and it gives it a nice shine

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.010 
really nice and it gives it a nice shine
now<00:04:09.800> let's<00:04:10.040> take<00:04:10.220> a<00:04:10.280> look<00:04:10.580> at<00:04:10.790> the<00:04:11.209> back<00:04:11.600> design

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
now let's take a look at the back design

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.490 
now let's take a look at the back design
the<00:04:12.709> back<00:04:12.920> design<00:04:13.340> has<00:04:13.700> that<00:04:14.300> really<00:04:14.750> really

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
the back design has that really really

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.280 
the back design has that really really
neat<00:04:15.770> optical<00:04:16.430> illusion<00:04:16.940> and<00:04:17.150> in<00:04:17.900> the<00:04:18.020> center

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
neat optical illusion and in the center

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.080 
neat optical illusion and in the center
you<00:04:18.500> you<00:04:18.710> have<00:04:18.859> some<00:04:19.190> sort<00:04:19.370> of<00:04:19.549> orb<00:04:19.850> or

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
you you have some sort of orb or

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.750 
you you have some sort of orb or
something<00:04:20.450> and<00:04:20.660> it's<00:04:21.500> really<00:04:21.650> really<00:04:22.550> cool

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
something and it's really really cool

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:23.900 
something and it's really really cool
it's<00:04:22.970> definitely

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
it's definitely

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.200 
it's definitely
a<00:04:23.940> new<00:04:24.210> idea<00:04:24.780> and<00:04:25.080> I<00:04:25.430> personally<00:04:26.430> like<00:04:26.910> it<00:04:27.090> a

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
a new idea and I personally like it a

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.910 
a new idea and I personally like it a
lot<00:04:27.450> so<00:04:27.810> now<00:04:27.960> that<00:04:28.110> we've<00:04:28.230> seen<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.560> design<00:04:28.890> of

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
lot so now that we've seen the design of

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.710 
lot so now that we've seen the design of
the<00:04:29.190> deck<00:04:29.400> let's<00:04:29.850> take<00:04:30.030> a<00:04:30.060> look<00:04:30.330> at<00:04:30.540> the

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
the deck let's take a look at the

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.590 
the deck let's take a look at the
handling<00:04:31.200> they<00:04:31.890> weren't<00:04:32.310> very<00:04:32.370> specific<00:04:32.820> with

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
handling they weren't very specific with

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.140 
handling they weren't very specific with
the<00:04:33.810> stock<00:04:34.200> and<00:04:34.500> finish<00:04:34.950> on<00:04:35.190> the<00:04:35.280> deck<00:04:35.520> but<00:04:36.030> it

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
the stock and finish on the deck but it

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.140 
the stock and finish on the deck but it
feels<00:04:36.330> like<00:04:36.570> bicycle<00:04:37.470> stock<00:04:37.740> and<00:04:38.070> they<00:04:38.850> said

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
feels like bicycle stock and they said

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.490 
feels like bicycle stock and they said
that<00:04:39.180> the<00:04:39.420> finish<00:04:39.750> is<00:04:40.020> some<00:04:40.290> sort<00:04:40.560> of<00:04:40.820> skulker

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
that the finish is some sort of skulker

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.400 
that the finish is some sort of skulker
finish<00:04:43.500> but<00:04:44.040> that<00:04:45.000> doesn't<00:04:45.270> exist<00:04:45.780> so<00:04:46.110> I<00:04:46.140> think

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
finish but that doesn't exist so I think

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.590 
finish but that doesn't exist so I think
it's<00:04:46.740> just<00:04:46.860> magic<00:04:47.520> finish<00:04:47.730> it's<00:04:48.090> got<00:04:48.270> a<00:04:48.300> really

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
it's just magic finish it's got a really

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.960 
it's just magic finish it's got a really
nice<00:04:48.990> feel<00:04:49.320> to<00:04:49.350> it<00:04:49.560> the<00:04:50.190> handling<00:04:50.670> of<00:04:50.790> this

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
nice feel to it the handling of this

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.810 
nice feel to it the handling of this
deck<00:04:51.240> is<00:04:51.480> just<00:04:52.020> really<00:04:52.830> nice<00:04:53.040> it's<00:04:53.340> a<00:04:53.400> very

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
deck is just really nice it's a very

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.330 
deck is just really nice it's a very
smooth<00:04:54.360> slick<00:04:55.200> deck<00:04:55.700> so<00:04:56.700> for<00:04:56.940> fans<00:04:57.240> it's<00:04:57.720> great

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
the indices show and a fan which I love

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.530 
the indices show and a fan which I love
they<00:05:02.130> printed<00:05:02.460> these<00:05:02.580> very<00:05:02.970> close<00:05:03.270> to<00:05:03.510> the

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
they printed these very close to the

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.260 
they printed these very close to the
edge<00:05:03.810> which<00:05:04.200> is<00:05:04.350> great<00:05:04.620> now<00:05:05.580> this<00:05:06.000> deck

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
edge which is great now this deck

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.080 
edge which is great now this deck
doesn't<00:05:06.690> have<00:05:06.840> thin<00:05:07.320> borders<00:05:07.800> which<00:05:08.250> I<00:05:08.550> really

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
doesn't have thin borders which I really

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.810 
doesn't have thin borders which I really
wish<00:05:09.360> it<00:05:09.390> did<00:05:09.810> but<00:05:10.050> some<00:05:10.860> of<00:05:11.010> the<00:05:11.130> design<00:05:11.520> does

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
wish it did but some of the design does

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.090 
wish it did but some of the design does
show<00:05:12.120> if<00:05:12.390> this<00:05:12.900> had<00:05:13.110> thin<00:05:13.320> borders<00:05:13.770> that

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
show if this had thin borders that

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.070 
show if this had thin borders that
optical<00:05:14.820> illusion<00:05:15.240> design<00:05:15.510> would<00:05:15.750> have<00:05:15.810> been

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
optical illusion design would have been

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660 
better handling decks that I have and

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.409

the design is really neat it's a very
original<00:06:27.810> deck<00:06:28.380> like<00:06:28.890> I<00:06:29.040> said<00:06:29.100> it's<00:06:29.550> the<00:06:29.940> first

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
original deck like I said it's the first

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.420 
original deck like I said it's the first
deck<00:06:30.480> that<00:06:30.780> has<00:06:30.810> an<00:06:31.169> optical<00:06:31.650> illusion<00:06:31.680> design

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.430 
deck that has an optical illusion design

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.510 
deck that has an optical illusion design
so<00:06:33.120> I<00:06:33.479> definitely<00:06:33.930> recommend<00:06:34.350> this<00:06:34.740> deck<00:06:35.070> it's
