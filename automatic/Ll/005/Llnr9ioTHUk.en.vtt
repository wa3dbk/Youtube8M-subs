actually heat up the end of the hose
some<00:02:40.920> boiling<00:02:41.130> water

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
some boiling water

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.940 
some boiling water
stick<00:02:42.660> it<00:02:42.780> in<00:02:42.810> there<00:02:42.960> for<00:02:42.990> like<00:02:43.230> thirty<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.920> a

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
stick it in there for like thirty to a

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.200 
stick it in there for like thirty to a
minute<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:45.170> then<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.290> shove<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.560> on<00:02:46.740> your

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
minute and then you shove it on your

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.120 
minute and then you shove it on your
piece<00:02:48.210> of<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.390> radiator<00:02:48.780> it<00:02:49.380> stretches<00:02:49.920> out

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
piece of the radiator it stretches out

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.040 
piece of the radiator it stretches out
because<00:02:50.790> not<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:51.240> really<00:02:51.330> does<00:02:51.600> not<00:02:51.750> say<00:02:51.990> you

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050

the<00:02:54.930> problem<00:02:55.260> is<00:02:55.350> you<00:02:55.470> can<00:02:55.590> either<00:02:55.740> find<00:02:55.920> the

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
the problem is you can either find the

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.610 
the problem is you can either find the
hose<00:02:56.160> too<00:02:56.370> big<00:02:56.580> or<00:02:56.790> too<00:02:56.820> little<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.450> it's<00:02:58.410> an

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
hose too big or too little and it's an

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.500 
hose too big or too little and it's an
odd<00:02:58.890> size<00:02:59.220> so<00:02:59.610> you<00:02:59.670> know<00:02:59.850> you<00:03:00.030> got<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.270> kind<00:03:00.420> of

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
odd size so you know you got to kind of

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.750 
odd size so you know you got to kind of
do<00:03:01.170> what<00:03:01.290> you<00:03:01.380> gotta<00:03:01.530> do<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.740> make<00:03:01.770> it<00:03:01.980> fit<00:03:02.190> no

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
do what you gotta do to make it fit no

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.470 
do what you gotta do to make it fit no
leaks<00:03:03.060> obviously<00:03:04.010> when<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.040> did<00:03:05.310> put<00:03:06.180> that<00:03:06.330> over

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
leaks obviously when I did put that over

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.050 
leaks obviously when I did put that over
there<00:03:07.190> I'd<00:03:08.190> do<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.490> same<00:03:08.550> thing<00:03:08.670> over<00:03:09.030> here

with the hose and I did is there's a
piece<00:03:12.480> here<00:03:12.950> cover<00:03:13.950> plate<00:03:14.220> drill<00:03:15.060> holes<00:03:15.330> do<00:03:16.020> it

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
piece here cover plate drill holes do it

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.390 
piece here cover plate drill holes do it
on<00:03:16.170> both<00:03:16.350> sides<00:03:16.650> so<00:03:16.860> I<00:03:16.920> can<00:03:16.950> run<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.280> hose
