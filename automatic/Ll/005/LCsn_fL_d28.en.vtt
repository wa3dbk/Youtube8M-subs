00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.660
 hello the next day I was thinking how 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.180
 we can make a cold coffee but with the 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.880
 material that we already have at home look 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:13.910
 everyone will probably have a 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.400
 filter coffee machine or everyone will have a 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.279
 filter tape which can put a 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.800
 filter paper and everyone will have 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.599
 surely options to buy very 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.029
 good coffees and everyone will have 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:29.150
 probably the option of having water 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.970
 filtered and ice look if you have those 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.520
 three components you can do what I 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.970
 I 'll call it as a second cold drink 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.780
 for this summer a v60 on the rocks 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:44.690
 this v60 is a type of filter that has been 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.850
 invented with such a special form of 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.020
 this way because it's called 60 because 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:54.320
 this is 60 closed then that's why 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:57.680
 v60 but it's mostly a kind of 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.710
 infusion for filter coffee and what I 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.320
 would do is grind 30 grams of coffee and in 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.810
 love in a grinding a little thinner 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.710
 that normally because we're going to throw him 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.520
 single 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.080
 hundreds and grams of water and this water 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.380
 it has to be filtered and that water 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.080
 heats hot water 90 to 93 degrees 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.210
 more or less to your pair of tests and you'll know 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.520
 what is the best result for coffee 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.740
 that you have at this moment in your 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.619
 hands but when you have done this 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.300
 infusion not forgiveness while you do 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.300
 this infusion places well in the 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:35.930
 container down ice cubes more or 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.750
 minus about 200 grams of ice and this 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.330
 way you get a drink that 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.210
 when it starts to filter directly 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.330
 It falls on the ice and you have a super 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.580
 good combination of sweet flavors and 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.990
 aromas that have stayed inside this 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:56.090
 liquid during this rapid cooling 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:00.580
 this is an easy way to make coffee 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.950
 of cold in your house or in your cafeteria 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.430
 to enjoy something different 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.729
 this summer eye uses special coffees 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.430
 well toasted because when they are cold 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.400
 it's the coffees you're going to notice more if they're not 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.790
 good for that a good coffee the first 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:22.030
 a good water the second and ice for 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.370
 cool it directly the third os 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.440
 I leave with this video see you tomorrow in 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.680
 a next video and we talk about the 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.740
 third way to make cafes rivers 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.740
 for this stretch I need one because 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.620
 I'm sweating really good and with those 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.810
 lights more we'll see you tomorrow leave a 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.750
