00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.069
 Hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.560
 diablo 3 since today I show you 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.179
 diablo 3 picture and the ice magier 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.950
 you see here I show you 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.000
 important thing is and how to do that then 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.639
 in the end, I'll play right away 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.460
 to his very aggressive class one 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.050
 should already intermediate 42 and 45 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.760
 had most of the needed 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.070
 ability to use 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.760
 and let's go before we get started 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.830
 getting started 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.840
 we play the console version here 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.000
 For that is also thought first over 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.380
 options to go on gameplay and 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.910
 grant this electoral mode now says 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.100
 so that he freely distributes the skills 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.620
 we can put it with the active one 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.040
 crafts go on we have no core 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.739
 magic we use here as standard as 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.690
 hacker the summit storm he at the frost 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.539
 As the safest woman, Stahl finds steel 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.399
 very very weak the belief storm 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.170
 again is very strong but has now 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.149
 very short radius how to do the whole thing 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.399
 I will still show you 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.949
 then we use the second attack 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.449
 Blizzard as rest we have stiff here 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.359
 Frozen for our opponents yet 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.799
 it is also one of the main ones to freeze 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:07.470
 abilities of this class as possible 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.540
 to freeze many enemies at once 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.340
 it does not hurt that extra here 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.840
 but not our main attack or 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.909
 that he mainly has to do this 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.740
 that's like this summit storm 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.820
 then a core skill is the frost nova 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.500
 With it you can be opponents in peace and 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.630
 even more important is the rhone 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.100
 then crash here you have the 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.840
 chance each opponent of the 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.790
 is frozen and he kills one 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.229
 additional costs or expenses and 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.439
 we will achieve that 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.060
 that if we are lucky we all 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.340
 Freezing enemies on the screen 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.229
 can gradually be the next one 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.770
 ability to do so we have the familiar 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.439
 and ak not as runa that we are farming 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.920
 Force steadily regenerating familiar 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.790
 active consume a lot of power can 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.970
 the lakes seen 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.570
 then i still have the equipment 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:59.430
 I apologize sorry for the equipment 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.860
 is also very important with the 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.649
 under green aura that means all opponents 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.329
 around us suffer from hypothermia 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.920
 also has an immediate effect 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.929
 which you will show later 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.710
 then we have the teleportation 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.630
 we use them 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.950
 not as usual to get out of the 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.690
 to fight off 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.790
 a hand but the fight happening 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.430
 that's why we have 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.170
 still the blast wave so catastrophe 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.880
 Here turn surrounded harm inflict 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.030
 if we just hit it 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.770
 then we will have to jump in 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.930
 Passive skills once the glass can 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.820
 without it serves to our harm 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.070
 optimize 15 percent more damage for it 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.670
 suffer the ten percent more or 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.120
 Deductions of upgrades and resistances 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.800
 sorry and when i get out 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.770
 then we jump once passive 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.320
 two cold-blooded also absolutely important 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.850
 increased damage by 20 percent 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.280
 frozen mountain cool and cool 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.200
 aim for this here 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.240
 equipment is the cool aura 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.530
 all the opponents in our circle always 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.930
 then we can cool the 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.330
 summit storm apply to the damage 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.890
 maximize 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.350
 in this respect very important ability to 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.580
 so that completes the sheet of variable 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.710
 flying the rubble that if you 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.760
 For example, you have the equipment active 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.900
 every second of life is regenerated 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.990
 alternatively you can because much can 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.150
 For example, power needs astral 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.220
 presence that the disease often around 20 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.450
 increased and their generation just that too 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.960
 it is up to you to see 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.940
 how to deal with those of ak magic here house 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.040
 holds fact is in any case you will 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:34.030
 to force her to kneel pretty fast 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.860
 Well then let's go as everyone 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.320
 first activate the equipment and 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.190
 plus the familiar and we overthrow 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.300
 let's get started 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.190
 then I'll show you how to do that 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.040
 whole plays we play here 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.960
 distance difficulty normal to one 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.080
 a bit loose fluffy I say 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.760
 to get through asking to the class 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.710
 of course in the comments and 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.300
 general question that will soon have a 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:59.430
 beginner guide or is direct 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.430
 times in joplin 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.110
 it is just not his doors 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.900
 I have to say I have ' 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.310
 usually the buttons a bit 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.520
 The paper distributes the game differently 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.170
 he partially chooses false attacks 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.410
 now makes a bigger opponent 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.300
 order where we can jump in 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:30.500
 I'll just pull some more 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.790
 opponent with male with david we come 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.230
 can present what it is here 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:38.780
 actually it works 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:40.070
 solar industry opponent to mine 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.220
 equipment will come soon 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.410
 what I have in here but that is 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.030
 we have already subordinated a few 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.090
 talk though and put afterwards 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.440
 directly the cost then because 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.120
 Double study places there will only 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.930
 you see, it's all going to be 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.640
 Frozen row after what is business 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.250
 since the fewest opponents have one 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.840
 chance to show that would be good 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.890
 even if she had that 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.090
 imitate the cave in act one 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.800
 with the spiders because there come yes 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.850
 really many opponents to look at you 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.650
 we were still a few opponents 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:16.880
 Finding does not always force only the big ones 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.190
 As you see, you believe 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.390
 but would be immensely harm 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.610
 descendants because that helps you 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:25.130
 teleportation the area is not that much 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.780
 just make the frost nova harm 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.830
 then it is very stressful to activate 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.420
 this choice is, therefore, one wants very 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.250
 get down with the global 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:34.300
 we have to do a bit of a storm though 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.300
 post or active 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.050
 I'll change it for another one 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.740
 marked picture show for the endgame 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:52.060
 May I make my akon match 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:53.980
 In addition, even without the ability 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:57.520
 play quite well on critical 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:59.290
 but damage acts for the emergency reserve 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.540
 just always in the archives too 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.710
 transform so strong opponents are too 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.750
 no problem with this picture like you 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:09.430
 then you can loose everything away 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:11.410
 and as I said in case of doubt 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.360
 for those who are far away 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.100
 Just set the blitzer to come in 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.050
 Let's take a quick look at the equipment 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.970
 in principle this is now one 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.800
 standard equipment is not specially designed 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.530
 The US market is important 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.150
 He causes the health and skin damage 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.650
 Upgrade swertz play in this class 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.000
 really a minor role looking 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:32.500
 that he as much as possible towards harm 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.210
 he now has 236 k I have 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.310
 still a relative before critical 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.930
 hit chance now at 48 percent and 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:41.350
 critical strike damage from 314 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.610
 percent the best scale I've ever had 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:46.300
 may have found the mg recommend 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:50.210
 the thorax madness of the times topped 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:51.380
 which was not anymore where that was 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.600
 I hope that we have a suggestion now 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:55.310
 for you the magician is different 

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.100
 play as mentioned once on melee with 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:02.210
 to go to him and then everything about this 

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:04.430
 appeal storm to break up 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.750
 Gentlemanly mood almost like me already 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:09.259
 a little bit more fun than mine 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:10.639
 Standard class, however, the significant 

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:12.440
 But it is even more effective here 

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:18.169
 makes you look at the opponents 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:19.250
 Happening a lot of damage well that 

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:20.660
 it was from me again 

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.099
 and as I said, see you next time 

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.419
 cold market there is a beginner 

00:07:22.099 --> 00:07:24.740
 guide next time there will be 

00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:27.169
 again for the broker as made for 

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:29.150
 contrary to the recommendation we give then 

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:32.120
 how can you play the game ? 

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:35.229
 wizard writes the comments up 

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.229
 the next video in front
