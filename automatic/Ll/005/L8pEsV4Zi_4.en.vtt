00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.799 
the major scale and just get a little
more<00:00:13.530> in<00:00:13.650> depth<00:00:14.150> over<00:00:15.150> here<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.480> our<00:00:15.509> diagram

more in depth over here to our diagram

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.260 
more in depth over here to our diagram
I've<00:00:16.470> draw<00:00:16.740> another<00:00:17.010> diagram<00:00:17.210> this<00:00:18.210> diagram

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
I've draw another diagram this diagram

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.460 
I've draw another diagram this diagram
is<00:00:18.960> out<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.500> major<00:00:19.710> scale<00:00:20.210> fingering<00:00:21.470> so

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
is out the major scale fingering so

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.080 
is out the major scale fingering so
you're<00:00:22.890> going<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.100> read<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.400> it's<00:00:23.789> going<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.000> go

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
you're going to read it it's going to go

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.529 
you're going to read it it's going to go
in<00:00:24.240> this<00:00:24.330> order<00:00:28.400> okay<00:00:29.400> now<00:00:30.210> we're<00:00:30.390> going<00:00:30.449> to

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
in this order okay now we're going to

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.030 
in this order okay now we're going to
start<00:00:30.810> we're<00:00:30.990> going<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.170> play<00:00:31.260> this<00:00:31.289> first<00:00:31.710> dot

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
start we're going to play this first dot

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.250 
start we're going to play this first dot
which<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.940> third<00:00:33.239> fret<00:00:33.510> on<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.809> low<00:00:34.050> E

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
which is the third fret on the low E

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.560 
which is the third fret on the low E
string<00:00:34.370> which<00:00:35.370> happens<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.790> be<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.969> G<00:00:36.300> notes

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
string which happens to be a G notes

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.990 
string which happens to be a G notes
this<00:00:36.840> will<00:00:37.050> be<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.200> G<00:00:37.500> Major<00:00:37.770> scale<00:00:37.920> we're<00:00:38.879> going

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
this will be a G Major scale we're going

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.930 
this will be a G Major scale we're going
to<00:00:39.059> start<00:00:39.420> with<00:00:39.989> our<00:00:40.050> second<00:00:40.590> finger<00:00:40.940> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
to start with our second finger the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.389 
to start with our second finger the
reason<00:00:42.210> we<00:00:42.329> do<00:00:42.480> that<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.960> because<00:00:43.230> we<00:00:44.129> get<00:00:44.250> down

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
reason we do that is because we get down

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.790 
reason we do that is because we get down
to<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:44.670> string<00:00:45.059> we<00:00:45.719> have<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.960> go<00:00:46.050> back<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.350> fret

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
to this string we have to go back a fret

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.170 
to this string we have to go back a fret
so<00:00:47.160> we're<00:00:47.250> going<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.430> use<00:00:47.550> our<00:00:47.640> index<00:00:48.059> finger

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
so we're going to use our index finger

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.840 
so we're going to use our index finger
to<00:00:48.629> play<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.989> note<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.800> note<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.670> way

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
to play that note and that note that way

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.970 
to play that note and that note that way
we<00:00:51.629> limit<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.050> amount<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.440> times<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.829> we

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
we limit the amount of times that we

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.479 
we limit the amount of times that we
have<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.219> shift<00:00:53.550> up<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.030> down<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.300> neck<00:00:55.489> this

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
have to shift up and down the neck this

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.830 
have to shift up and down the neck this
will<00:00:56.699> allow<00:00:56.760> us<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.000> stay<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.360> one<00:00:57.449> position

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
will allow us to stay in one position

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.060 
will allow us to stay in one position
now<00:00:58.770> i'm<00:00:58.859> going<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.070> show<00:00:59.219> you<00:01:00.829> second<00:01:01.829> fret

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
now i'm going to show you second fret

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:14.389 
now i'm going to show you second fret
i'm<00:01:02.550> sorry<00:01:02.850> third<00:01:03.149> fret<00:01:03.449> second<00:01:03.930> finger

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:17.609 

that's<00:01:15.399> our<00:01:15.579> G<00:01:15.789> Major<00:01:16.000> scale<00:01:16.320> now<00:01:17.320> if<00:01:17.409> we<00:01:17.530> would

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
that's our G Major scale now if we would

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.099 
that's our G Major scale now if we would
have<00:01:17.649> started<00:01:17.979> with<00:01:18.820> our<00:01:18.880> first<00:01:19.000> finger<00:01:19.299> when

00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:20.109 
have started with our first finger when

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:23.130 
have started with our first finger when
we<00:01:20.200> got<00:01:20.350> to<00:01:20.579> the<00:01:21.579> second<00:01:21.969> string<00:01:22.270> or<00:01:22.869> to<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.079> a

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
we got to the second string or to the a

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.350 
we got to the second string or to the a
string<00:01:23.619> we<00:01:24.100> would<00:01:24.219> have<00:01:24.340> to<00:01:24.460> shift<00:01:24.819> back<00:01:27.360> but

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
string we would have to shift back but

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.319 
string we would have to shift back but
starting<00:01:28.869> with<00:01:28.959> our<00:01:29.079> second<00:01:29.469> finger<00:01:30.329> allows

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:31.329 
starting with our second finger allows

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:34.109 
starting with our second finger allows
us<00:01:31.569> to<00:01:31.719> not<00:01:31.869> have<00:01:32.079> to<00:01:32.200> do<00:01:32.350> that<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.880> makes<00:01:34.060> you

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
us to not have to do that that makes you

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:35.940 
us to not have to do that that makes you
play<00:01:34.329> more<00:01:34.600> efficiently<00:01:35.109> and<00:01:35.439> as<00:01:35.709> you<00:01:35.799> get

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
play more efficiently and as you get

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.469 
play more efficiently and as you get
further<00:01:36.130> down<00:01:36.280> the<00:01:36.520> road<00:01:36.700> it's<00:01:37.090> going<00:01:37.270> to<00:01:37.329> make

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
further down the road it's going to make

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.139 
further down the road it's going to make
you<00:01:37.719> a<00:01:38.069> faster<00:01:39.069> guitar<00:01:39.369> player<00:01:41.310> now<00:01:42.310> once<00:01:43.030> you

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
you a faster guitar player now once you

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:44.999 
you a faster guitar player now once you
get<00:01:43.270> this<00:01:43.420> down<00:01:43.659> you<00:01:44.110> want<00:01:44.289> to<00:01:44.349> practice<00:01:44.770> the

get this down you want to practice the

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.179 
get this down you want to practice the

and you want to remember to alternate

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:14.009 
and you want to remember to alternate
you're<00:02:01.149> picking<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:13.030> can<00:02:13.150> also<00:02:13.329> play<00:02:13.780> this

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
using this finger pattern you can play

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.479 
using this finger pattern you can play
it<00:02:16.540> anywhere<00:02:17.109> as<00:02:17.350> long<00:02:17.380> as<00:02:17.739> you<00:02:17.859> start<00:02:18.160> on<00:02:18.370> the
