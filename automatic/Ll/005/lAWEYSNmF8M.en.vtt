00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.549
 Costs for artists easily outbid 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:24.589
 that could also be 302 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:27.589
 Nevertheless, we have to see each other again 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.830
 Prototype are fascinating 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.780
 here the many VIPs know the cow and the Erzgebirge 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.740
 because they are standing by a car 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.530
 probably already males would need Euro Silvia Engels &amp; Bergmann 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.930
 Symbol image the most common most constructive the wind plays against and 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.930
 for on metering 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.690
 a Christmassy atmosphere as scattered are this place 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.030
 and many of them also brag some of them 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.380
 which then at Christmas time four and five stayed cold 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.330
 at Christmas stories seem to create 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.720
 Frings me then the pyramids 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.030
 In Doha people are passing the test for incense when it's freezing outside 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.040
 is cold 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.270
 the snowflakes fall from the sky 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.169
 In the game plans it is bawdy and cozy at this time 

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.849
 for breaks a cold wind blows the snowflakes and jackets allowed 

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:32.429
 even two more for Opel she joins us 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:35.749
 one finds in this time meets Christoph posed 

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:37.319
 with execution 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.669
 and fear with that in it 

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:43.529
 the miniature mine in Baghdad 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:46.469
 under-challenged by the 15 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:49.059
 Clients are here 

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:53.479
 this all reflects the Christmas traditions broken in the Ore Mountains 

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:56.489
 at pizza to around 5 1 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.489
 Petersen arise 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:02.339
 for watching 

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:04.579
 and thank you for your interest 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.269
 I would be glad if they once again kept my plan
