as<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.549> tested<00:01:50.970> this<00:01:52.009> walking<00:01:53.009> in<00:01:53.159> here<00:01:54.380> you

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
as I tested this walking in here you

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.440 
as I tested this walking in here you
press<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.770> button<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:56.159> call<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.490> car<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:56.939> the

car drops and you would normally get it
I'm<00:02:01.140> not<00:02:01.469> because<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.860> want<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.070> show<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.340> that

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
one that doesn't use another booster see

one that doesn't use another booster see
nothing<00:02:08.580> obvious<00:02:09.050> now<00:02:10.370> we<00:02:11.370> wait<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:12.060> takes<00:02:12.390> a

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
nothing obvious now we wait it takes a

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.460 
nothing obvious now we wait it takes a
bit<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.660> warm<00:02:12.870> up<00:02:13.110> as

bit to warm up as
per<00:02:13.620> usual<00:02:14.180> then<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.330> second<00:02:15.720> year<00:02:15.870> it<00:02:16.020> will

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
per usual then the second year it will

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.610 
per usual then the second year it will
boost<00:02:19.040> right<00:02:20.040> there<00:02:21.230> doesn't<00:02:22.230> activate<00:02:22.470> the

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
card detection system it goes in let's

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:32.810 
card detection system it goes in let's
call<00:02:24.810> another<00:02:24.990> one<00:02:30.470> it<00:02:31.470> drops<00:02:31.860> will<00:02:32.370> just<00:02:32.640> get

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
call another one it drops will just get

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:40.240 
call another one it drops will just get
any<00:02:33.800> and<00:02:34.850> because<00:02:35.850> we're<00:02:36.030> in<00:02:36.270> it<00:02:38.480> get<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.600> second

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
any and because we're in it get a second

any and because we're in it get a second
because<00:02:41.250> we're<00:02:41.580> in<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:42.110> we<00:02:43.110> go<00:02:43.290> off<00:02:44.750> i'll<00:02:45.750> be

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
because we're in it we go off i'll be

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.500 
because we're in it we go off i'll be
showing<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.350> how<00:02:46.380> that<00:02:46.650> works<00:02:46.680> later<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.550> some

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
showing you how that works later to some

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.449 
showing you how that works later to some
information<00:02:49.020> before<00:02:49.290> i<00:02:49.320> say<00:02:49.590> you<00:02:49.650> exactly<00:02:50.280> how

information before i say you exactly how

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.640 
information before i say you exactly how
to<00:02:50.490> build<00:02:50.880> it<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.750> whole<00:02:51.930> thing<00:02:52.200> not

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
to build it the whole thing not

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.850 
to build it the whole thing not

the<00:03:02.550> one<00:03:02.700> you<00:03:02.850> ride<00:03:03.090> it's<00:03:03.450> a<00:03:03.540> little<00:03:03.810> weaker

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
the one you ride it's a little weaker

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.199 
the one you ride it's a little weaker
than<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.040> one<00:03:05.190> shown<00:03:05.459> in<00:03:05.490> our<00:03:05.700> other<00:03:05.850> videos

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
than the one shown in our other videos

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.090 
than the one shown in our other videos
but<00:03:06.450> it's<00:03:06.600> possible<00:03:07.080> to<00:03:07.260> make<00:03:07.380> it<00:03:07.500> as<00:03:07.620> strong

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
but it's possible to make it as strong

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.070 
but it's possible to make it as strong
with<00:03:08.670> almost<00:03:08.880> no<00:03:09.120> extra<00:03:09.360> space<00:03:09.600> just<00:03:09.930> more

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
with almost no extra space just more

mine carts and tracks the smaller one

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.370 
mine carts and tracks the smaller one
will<00:03:12.720> send<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:13.160> approximately<00:03:14.600> 6,000<00:03:15.600> tracks

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
will send you approximately 6,000 tracks

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.330 
will send you approximately 6,000 tracks
with<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.740> rider<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.239> 500<00:03:18.239> without<00:03:18.360> one

with the rider and 500 without one
alright<00:03:20.959> let's<00:03:21.959> build<00:03:23.540> now<00:03:24.540> this<00:03:25.050> compact

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
alright let's build now this compact

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.400 
alright let's build now this compact
booster<00:03:26.280> uses<00:03:26.640> almost<00:03:26.880> every<00:03:27.600> single<00:03:27.810> quark

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
booster uses almost every single quark

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.210 
booster uses almost every single quark
of<00:03:29.280> tracks<00:03:30.239> of<00:03:30.630> mine<00:03:31.140> carts<00:03:31.500> that<00:03:31.590> i<00:03:31.709> can<00:03:31.950> find

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
of tracks of mine carts that i can find

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.820 
of tracks of mine carts that i can find
some<00:03:33.090> that<00:03:33.360> i<00:03:33.420> don't<00:03:33.780> think<00:03:33.840> most<00:03:34.440> people<00:03:34.560> know

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
some that i don't think most people know

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.090 
some that i don't think most people know
about<00:03:35.100> or<00:03:35.910> anybody<00:03:36.360> anything<00:03:36.739> so<00:03:37.739> the<00:03:37.830> first

about or anybody anything so the first

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.940 
about or anybody anything so the first
thing<00:03:38.250> is<00:03:38.700> we<00:03:39.180> need<00:03:39.600> to<00:03:39.660> find<00:03:39.959> our<00:03:40.290> west<00:03:40.590> and

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
thing is we need to find our west and

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.030 
thing is we need to find our west and
our<00:03:41.070> self<00:03:41.570> here<00:03:42.570> we<00:03:42.750> go<00:03:42.930> this<00:03:43.739> is<00:03:43.890> the

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
our self here we go this is the

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.610 
our self here we go this is the
direction<00:03:44.190> that<00:03:44.549> mine<00:03:45.060> carts<00:03:45.540> and<00:03:45.780> tracks<00:03:46.320> are

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
direction that mine carts and tracks are

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.330 
direction that mine carts and tracks are
most<00:03:46.860> likely<00:03:47.160> to<00:03:47.940> turn<00:03:48.150> to<00:03:48.680> alright<00:03:49.680> this<00:03:50.280> is

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
most likely to turn to alright this is

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.460 
most likely to turn to alright this is
very<00:03:50.820> important<00:03:51.510> we'll<00:03:51.600> be<00:03:51.630> using<00:03:51.959> this<00:03:52.230> all

with the boost part coming out this way
you<00:04:11.010> see<00:04:11.190> what<00:04:11.340> I<00:04:11.370> mean<00:04:11.549> when<00:04:11.700> I<00:04:11.730> build<00:04:12.000> it

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
you see what I mean when I build it

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.630 
you see what I mean when I build it
alright<00:04:13.200> now<00:04:13.410> that<00:04:13.470> we<00:04:13.769> know<00:04:13.799> our<00:04:14.100> western<00:04:14.489> our

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
alright now that we know our western our

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.030 
alright now that we know our western our
south<00:04:15.169> we<00:04:16.169> can<00:04:16.290> look<00:04:16.410> at<00:04:16.560> a<00:04:16.590> couple<00:04:16.739> more

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
south we can look at a couple more

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.130 
south we can look at a couple more
quirks<00:04:18.769> having<00:04:19.769> a<00:04:19.859> booster<00:04:20.370> facing<00:04:21.090> north<00:04:21.780> or

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
quirks having a booster facing north or

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.120 
quirks having a booster facing north or
east<00:04:23.000> makes<00:04:24.000> it<00:04:24.150> possible<00:04:24.330> make<00:04:24.810> a<00:04:24.840> small<00:04:25.560> cell

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
east makes it possible make a small cell

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.820 
east makes it possible make a small cell
for<00:04:26.370> setting<00:04:26.700> booster

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
for setting booster

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.550 
for setting booster
now<00:04:28.830> it's<00:04:29.419> thought<00:04:30.419> not<00:04:30.750> to<00:04:30.780> be<00:04:31.259> able<00:04:31.379> to

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
now it's thought not to be able to

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.460 
now it's thought not to be able to
believe<00:04:31.800> to<00:04:32.490> make<00:04:32.669> it<00:04:32.849> any<00:04:33.780> other<00:04:33.930> direction

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.740 

because<00:04:37.470> if<00:04:37.770> you<00:04:37.949> replace<00:04:38.310> this<00:04:38.520> one<00:04:38.789> it<00:04:39.060> just

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
because if you replace this one it just

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.330 
because if you replace this one it just
goes<00:04:39.900> and<00:04:40.110> follows<00:04:40.470> the<00:04:40.500> southwest<00:04:41.099> wall

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
goes and follows the southwest wall

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:48.020 
goes and follows the southwest wall
however<00:04:43.789> using<00:04:44.789> your<00:04:45.090> redstone<00:04:46.789> you<00:04:47.789> can<00:04:47.940> make

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
however using your redstone you can make

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.640 
however using your redstone you can make
a<00:04:48.060> cell<00:04:48.300> for<00:04:48.419> setting<00:04:48.720> booster<00:04:48.930> just<00:04:49.379> place

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
a cell for setting booster just place

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:55.180 
a cell for setting booster just place
the<00:04:49.800> torch<00:04:50.009> next<00:04:50.520> to<00:04:50.729> it<00:04:50.879> and<00:04:52.400> it'll<00:04:53.400> stay

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
the torch next to it and it'll stay

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.379 
the torch next to it and it'll stay
that's<00:04:56.190> very<00:04:56.430> important<00:04:56.940> we'll<00:04:57.090> be<00:04:57.210> using

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
that's very important we'll be using

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.369 
that's very important we'll be using
that<00:04:59.360> finally<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:00.479> last<00:05:00.509> type<00:05:01.020> of<00:05:01.169> work<00:05:01.349> we

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:01.379 
that finally the last type of work we

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:03.619 
that finally the last type of work we
need<00:05:01.710> to<00:05:01.800> know<00:05:01.979> is<00:05:02.280> how<00:05:02.520> pressure<00:05:02.940> pads<00:05:03.300> can

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:03.629 
need to know is how pressure pads can

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:07.930 
need to know is how pressure pads can
get<00:05:03.780> activated<00:05:04.319> without<00:05:04.979> another<00:05:05.580> booster

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
get activated without another booster

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.089 
get activated without another booster
you<00:05:08.940> see<00:05:09.150> that<00:05:09.360> because<00:05:09.900> the<00:05:10.440> way<00:05:10.590> it<00:05:10.770> turns

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:11.099 
you see that because the way it turns

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:13.879 
you see that because the way it turns
the<00:05:11.370> way<00:05:11.520> it<00:05:11.639> moves<00:05:11.849> on<00:05:11.969> these<00:05:12.120> tracks<00:05:12.889> the

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
the way it moves on these tracks the

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.709 
the way it moves on these tracks the
cart<00:05:14.250> will<00:05:15.210> activate<00:05:15.870> it<00:05:16.310> like<00:05:17.310> that<00:05:17.550> now<00:05:18.509> it

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:18.719 
cart will activate it like that now it

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:21.499 
cart will activate it like that now it
is<00:05:19.500> important<00:05:20.039> how<00:05:20.280> fast<00:05:20.639> the<00:05:20.879> booster<00:05:21.270> how

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:21.509 
is important how fast the booster how

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:24.110 
is important how fast the booster how
fast<00:05:21.810> the<00:05:21.990> card<00:05:22.199> is<00:05:22.379> going<00:05:22.849> sometimes<00:05:23.849> if<00:05:24.030> it's

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
fast the card is going sometimes if it's

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.230 
fast the card is going sometimes if it's
going<00:05:24.300> too<00:05:24.449> fast<00:05:24.629> it<00:05:24.960> won't<00:05:25.139> activate<00:05:26.030> so<00:05:27.030> in

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
going too fast it won't activate so in

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.249 
going too fast it won't activate so in
order<00:05:27.360> to<00:05:27.509> prevent<00:05:27.900> that<00:05:29.300> all<00:05:30.300> we<00:05:31.020> need<00:05:31.229> is

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:31.259 
order to prevent that all we need is

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:37.010 
order to prevent that all we need is
this<00:05:33.830> the<00:05:34.830> cart<00:05:35.130> flips<00:05:35.550> out<00:05:35.729> flips<00:05:36.449> like<00:05:36.659> crazy

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
this the cart flips out flips like crazy

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.080 
this the cart flips out flips like crazy
so<00:05:37.680> we<00:05:37.949> can<00:05:38.130> just<00:05:38.279> place<00:05:38.819> it<00:05:38.849> at<00:05:39.029> the<00:05:39.060> side

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
so we can just place it at the side

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:50.689 
so we can just place it at the side
actually<00:05:42.090> other<00:05:42.599> side<00:05:48.650> and<00:05:49.650> it<00:05:50.099> activates<00:05:50.250> it

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 
actually other side and it activates it

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:53.779 
actually other side and it activates it
no<00:05:51.240> loss<00:05:51.479> to<00:05:51.779> speed<00:05:52.199> or<00:05:52.469> anything<00:05:52.949> this<00:05:53.580> is

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:53.789 
no loss to speed or anything this is

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:56.689 
no loss to speed or anything this is
very<00:05:53.940> important<00:05:54.569> to<00:05:54.659> I'm<00:05:55.469> /<00:05:55.830> and<00:05:56.039> I<00:05:56.159> as<00:05:56.310> far<00:05:56.580> as
