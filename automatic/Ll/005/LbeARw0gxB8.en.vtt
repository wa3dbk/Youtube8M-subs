stock FRS or B or Z quite some time but
all<00:03:00.480> I'm<00:03:00.720> getting<00:03:00.870> is<00:03:01.080> some<00:03:01.380> engine<00:03:01.740> noise

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
all I'm getting is some engine noise

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.729 
all I'm getting is some engine noise
maybe<00:03:02.420> yeah<00:03:03.420> it's<00:03:04.140> uh

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
maybe yeah it's uh

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:14.530 
maybe yeah it's uh
it's<00:03:06.250> pretty<00:03:06.430> tame

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.350 

so<00:03:15.049> yeah<00:03:15.260> so<00:03:15.680> what<00:03:15.950> it's<00:03:16.370> a<00:03:16.519> like<00:03:16.730> a<00:03:16.970> mirror<00:03:17.209> our

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
so yeah so what it's a like a mirror our

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:47.020 
so yeah so what it's a like a mirror our
thoughts<00:03:17.599> yeah<00:03:18.049> the<00:03:19.040> probably<00:03:19.459> is<00:03:19.610> Bluetooth

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.880 

okay<00:03:48.030> so<00:03:48.810> here<00:03:49.080> we<00:03:49.200> are<00:03:49.230> getting<00:03:49.530> set<00:03:49.650> up<00:03:49.709> on

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
okay so here we are getting set up on

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.410 
okay so here we are getting set up on
the<00:03:49.980> dyno<00:03:50.190> we<00:03:51.180> are<00:03:51.480> at<00:03:51.870> central<00:03:52.440> imports<00:03:52.920> our

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
the dyno we are at central imports our

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.330 
the dyno we are at central imports our
local<00:03:54.420> shop<00:03:54.690> that<00:03:55.019> we<00:03:55.140> partner<00:03:55.590> with<00:03:55.620> to<00:03:56.099> use

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
local shop that we partner with to use

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.509 
local shop that we partner with to use
their<00:03:56.760> dyno<00:03:57.530> we've<00:03:58.530> done<00:03:58.739> all<00:03:58.920> of<00:03:58.950> our<00:03:59.099> testing

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
their dyno we've done all of our testing

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.280 
their dyno we've done all of our testing
on<00:03:59.670> this<00:03:59.819> dyno<00:04:00.120> for<00:04:00.299> all<00:04:00.629> of<00:04:00.750> our<00:04:00.870> cars

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
on this dyno for all of our cars

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.570 
on this dyno for all of our cars
so<00:04:02.040> same<00:04:02.580> dyno<00:04:02.849> same<00:04:03.660> conditions<00:04:04.260> it<00:04:04.620> is<00:04:05.129> a

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
so same dyno same conditions it is a

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.150 
so same dyno same conditions it is a
indoor<00:04:06.180> dyno<00:04:06.590> that<00:04:07.590> is<00:04:07.739> climate<00:04:08.129> controlled

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
indoor dyno that is climate controlled

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.520 
indoor dyno that is climate controlled
they<00:04:09.000> usually<00:04:09.150> have<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:09.750> tempter<00:04:10.170> set<00:04:10.349> around

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
they usually have the tempter set around

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.250 
they usually have the tempter set around
65<00:04:11.069> degrees<00:04:11.099> on<00:04:11.670> there<00:04:11.849> in<00:04:11.940> the<00:04:12.030> shop<00:04:12.209> so<00:04:13.080> these

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
65 degrees on there in the shop so these

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.159 
65 degrees on there in the shop so these
are<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.500> conditions<00:04:13.920> that<00:04:14.010> we're<00:04:14.280> testing<00:04:14.459> it

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:15.169 
are the conditions that we're testing it

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:18.699 
are the conditions that we're testing it
again<00:04:16.169> the<00:04:16.380> car<00:04:16.590> is<00:04:16.859> bone<00:04:17.669> stock<00:04:18.090> and

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
again the car is bone stock and

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.460 
again the car is bone stock and
reflashed<00:04:19.709> back<00:04:20.280> to<00:04:20.579> stock<00:04:20.880> and<00:04:21.320> the<00:04:22.320> only

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
reflashed back to stock and the only

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.590 
reflashed back to stock and the only
modification<00:04:22.800> done<00:04:23.400> to<00:04:23.580> it<00:04:23.700> is<00:04:23.850> our<00:04:24.120> catted

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
modification done to it is our catted

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.000 
modification done to it is our catted
UEL<00:04:25.500> header<00:04:26.419> so<00:04:27.419> onto<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:28.229> dyno<00:04:28.500> none<00:04:28.800> of<00:04:28.950> the

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
UEL header so onto the dyno none of the

00:04:29.010 --> 00:05:08.900
