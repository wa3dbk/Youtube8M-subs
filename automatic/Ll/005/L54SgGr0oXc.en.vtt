 the envelope he received contained a CD 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:18.680

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.179
 serious misfortune puts a mark on who 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.929
 he looks at and condemns a certain death 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:24.399

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:25.929

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:27.340

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:29.469
 dead and tried to drive away 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.869

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.479
