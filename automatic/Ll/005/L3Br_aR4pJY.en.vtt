00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.010
 good to give 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.890
 welcome as glass and struck out two where we're going we'll talk about how in 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:08.929
 cover page 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:11.929
 the videos our iphone 3gs 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:14.269
 to our library to speak 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:19.609
 I move everything to be able to subsequently do besides editing thanks to 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:21.779
 encouragement program 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.779
 The first thing we will do is connect our device 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.269
 we will open to the bottom 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.430
 and automatically in the devices option we will observe that we have 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.230
 our iphone 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.670
 and we have here coscubila people have been taken and a video 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.670
 the video we are not going to distinguish since it has 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.920
 respective icon the fourth 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.290
 the indicative does it in a very fast way 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.190
 us as we only want to import that video so that it is available on 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.570
 mobile or directly our library for later uses we select 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.040
 we only select the video 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.310
 a video if we had more 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.810
 sectional more 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.830
 or on the cover everything sane we think then we aspire survived 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.780
 We're going to mark the event that we believe 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.340
 what's left 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.340
 i make who's pick 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.670
 import is prepared 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.800
 this will take more fome less depending on the service size in 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.260
 that moment we have finished the deportation 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.920
 ask if we want to keep or eliminate 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.060
 if we are going to keep 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.660
 the video 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.660
 will still be available in our arch 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.759
 in fact if we fall down then we will observe that we have here 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.270
 our video file 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.080
 and once the photo library has already been placed 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.800
 if we close the application 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.290
 we'll see air mobile 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.480
 detects that there are new miniatures that we are going to import 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.349
 now 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.000
 It is processing the videos and photos with may take more with less time 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:20.829
 if we have not done it it can never take longer and we have more videos 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:22.430
 in this case it shows 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.430
 all videos kan the photo library 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.139
 the last video 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:31.979
 available the one that comes from our halfÃ³n three genes 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:35.809
 As you can see, it's easy to enjoy 

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:41.369
 the videos that we have our iphone can bring them to the photographer topeka 

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:45.789
 have them cataloged there to later be able to work with 

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:48.639
 fragments I take the whole money 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:50.829
 making a selection 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.969
 i can the guitar 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:59.879
 add music effects i perform all kinds of tasks that allow us to allow something 

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:04.619
 that's all we see in a next villa 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.329
