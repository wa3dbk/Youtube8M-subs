00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.929 

okay<00:00:00.810> so<00:00:00.870> originally<00:00:01.560> I<00:00:01.800> mentioned<00:00:02.460> that<00:00:02.669> I

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
okay so originally I mentioned that I

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.200 
okay so originally I mentioned that I
was<00:00:03.149> going<00:00:03.419> to<00:00:03.480> take<00:00:03.720> off<00:00:03.959> this<00:00:04.730> air<00:00:05.730> box<00:00:05.970> right

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
was going to take off this air box right

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.930 
was going to take off this air box right
here<00:00:06.420> but<00:00:06.960> I<00:00:06.990> think<00:00:07.290> we<00:00:07.410> got<00:00:07.440> enough<00:00:07.799> room<00:00:07.980> to

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
here but I think we got enough room to

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.660 
here but I think we got enough room to
access<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:10.139> spark<00:00:10.440> plugs<00:00:10.740> which<00:00:12.920> one<00:00:13.920> two

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
access the spark plugs which one two

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.130 
access the spark plugs which one two
three<00:00:15.599> four<00:00:16.260> over<00:00:16.529> here<00:00:16.609> back<00:00:17.609> in<00:00:17.820> there

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
three four over here back in there

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.170 
three four over here back in there
I<00:00:19.170> had<00:00:19.800> this<00:00:19.949> off<00:00:20.130> originally<00:00:20.369> because<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:21.119> took

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
I had this off originally because I took

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:29.120 
I had this off originally because I took
off<00:00:22.460> the<00:00:23.460> air<00:00:24.090> pump<00:00:26.570> for<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.869> clean<00:00:28.080> system<00:00:28.320> so

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
off the air pump for the clean system so

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.250 
off the air pump for the clean system so
I've<00:00:29.310> already<00:00:29.849> taken<00:00:30.060> this<00:00:30.300> off<00:00:32.270> basically<00:00:33.270> in

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
I've already taken this off basically in

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.350 
I've already taken this off basically in
the<00:00:34.829> driven<00:00:35.070> kit<00:00:35.489> they<00:00:35.790> give<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.149> block

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
the driven kit they give you the block

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.150 
the driven kit they give you the block
hops<00:00:36.630> plus<00:00:37.079> they<00:00:37.200> give<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.500> plug<00:00:37.800> which

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
hops plus they give you a plug which

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.869 
hops plus they give you a plug which
blocks<00:00:38.820> off<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.800> air<00:00:40.800> box<00:00:41.010> right<00:00:41.309> here<00:00:41.520> so<00:00:41.850> I

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
blocks off the air box right here so I

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.880 
blocks off the air box right here so I
have<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.590> plug<00:00:43.590> installed<00:00:44.070> right<00:00:44.489> here<00:00:45.890> as

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
have the plug installed right here as

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.430 
have the plug installed right here as
you<00:00:47.070> can<00:00:47.100> see<00:00:47.450> that<00:00:48.450> goes<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.840> air<00:00:48.930> box<00:00:49.110> and

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
you can see that goes to the air box and

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.470 
you can see that goes to the air box and
then<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.190> have<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.610> driven<00:00:50.850> block<00:00:51.300> offs<00:00:53.480> here's

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
then I have the driven block offs here's

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.750 
then I have the driven block offs here's
one<00:00:54.690> right<00:00:54.870> here<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.860> then<00:00:56.039> another<00:00:56.100> one<00:00:56.430> over

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
one right here and then another one over

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.090 
one right here and then another one over
here<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:57.059> guys<00:00:57.210> all<00:00:57.480> know<00:00:57.629> where<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.100> where

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
here you guys all know where the where

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.729 
here you guys all know where the where
those<00:00:59.250> are<00:00:59.430> at<00:01:00.320> what<00:01:01.320> I'm<00:01:01.410> gonna<00:01:01.530> be

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
those are at what I'm gonna be

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.460 
those are at what I'm gonna be
installing<00:01:01.980> now<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:03.890> a<00:01:05.030> resistor<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.210> place<00:01:07.049> of

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
installing now is a resistor in place of

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.719 
installing now is a resistor in place of
the<00:01:08.540> air<00:01:09.540> pump<00:01:10.500> connections<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.460> don't

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
the air pump connections so you don't

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.420 
the air pump connections so you don't
throw<00:01:11.909> an<00:01:12.090> f-1<00:01:12.450> light<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:13.439> I've<00:01:13.530> already<00:01:13.830> made

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
throw an f-1 light so I've already made

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.810 
throw an f-1 light so I've already made
one<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.729> these<00:01:16.130> I'm<00:01:17.130> just<00:01:17.340> gonna<00:01:17.430> go<00:01:17.640> ahead<00:01:17.700> and

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
one of these I'm just gonna go ahead and

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.850 
one of these I'm just gonna go ahead and
plug<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.210> in

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:32.770 

these<00:01:25.860> are<00:01:26.630> 2<00:01:28.400> 5<00:01:29.400> watt<00:01:29.820> by<00:01:30.630> 10<00:01:31.110> ohm<00:01:31.410> resistors

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
these are 2 5 watt by 10 ohm resistors

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.900 
these are 2 5 watt by 10 ohm resistors
wired<00:01:34.220> in<00:01:35.220> parallel<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.750> make<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:37.200> 10<00:01:37.740> watt<00:01:38.100> 20

wired in parallel to make a 10 watt 20
ohm<00:01:39.030> resistor<00:01:39.750> there<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.440> go<00:01:40.560> plugs<00:01:40.860> right<00:01:41.010> in

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
ohm resistor there you go plugs right in

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.680 
ohm resistor there you go plugs right in
there<00:01:41.340> take<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.700> little<00:01:41.910> electrical<00:01:42.330> tape<00:01:42.570> and

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
there take a little electrical tape and

00:01:42.690 --> 00:02:14.930 
there take a little electrical tape and
we'll<00:01:42.960> tape<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.350> in

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:24.930 

yeah<00:02:15.570> are<00:02:15.690> very<00:02:15.900> simple

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.240 

now

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
now

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.670 
now
the<00:02:27.760> most<00:02:27.940> difficult<00:02:28.150> part<00:02:28.930> about<00:02:29.110> changing

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
the most difficult part about changing

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.380 
the most difficult part about changing
these<00:02:29.860> spark<00:02:30.220> plugs<00:02:30.330> are<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.630> spark<00:02:31.930> plugs

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
these spark plugs are the spark plugs

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.560 
these spark plugs are the spark plugs
near<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.570> the<00:02:35.200> frames<00:02:35.940> this<00:02:36.940> one<00:02:37.120> right<00:02:37.270> here

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
near the the frames this one right here

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:44.390 
near the the frames this one right here
and<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:38.200> other<00:02:38.350> one<00:02:38.530> over<00:02:38.650> here<00:02:42.750> right<00:02:43.750> there

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
and the other one over here right there

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.060 
and the other one over here right there
now<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.460> problem<00:02:45.850> they're<00:02:46.000> having<00:02:46.420> is<00:02:47.080> once

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
now the problem they're having is once

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.770 
now the problem they're having is once
you

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
you

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.760 
you
I<00:02:49.810> guess<00:02:50.200> there's<00:02:50.440> just<00:02:50.590> not<00:02:50.710> enough

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
I guess there's just not enough

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.160 
I guess there's just not enough
clearance<00:02:51.340> but<00:02:51.880> I<00:02:51.910> found<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.390> way<00:02:52.570> where<00:02:53.080> you

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
clearance but I found a way where you

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.820 
clearance but I found a way where you
can<00:02:53.200> do<00:02:53.530> it<00:02:53.560> without<00:02:53.850> taking<00:02:54.850> the<00:02:55.830> engine

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
can do it without taking the engine

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.480 
can do it without taking the engine
bulks<00:02:57.250> off<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:57.730> drop<00:02:57.970> in<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.270> engine<00:02:58.540> I<00:02:58.630> guess

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
bulks off and drop in the engine I guess

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.030 
bulks off and drop in the engine I guess
they've<00:03:00.490> explained<00:03:01.170> that's<00:03:02.170> one<00:03:02.740> of<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:02.920> ways

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
they've explained that's one of the ways

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.250 
they've explained that's one of the ways
to<00:03:03.100> do<00:03:03.460> it<00:03:03.490> to<00:03:03.910> access<00:03:04.630> those<00:03:04.870> particular

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
to do it to access those particular

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.630 
to do it to access those particular
plugs<00:03:05.830> but<00:03:06.700> I<00:03:07.000> found<00:03:07.660> with<00:03:08.110> the<00:03:08.590> spark<00:03:09.400> plug

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
plugs but I found with the spark plug

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.690 
plugs but I found with the spark plug
remover<00:03:10.150> that's<00:03:10.450> found<00:03:10.750> in<00:03:11.080> your<00:03:11.670> tool<00:03:12.670> kit

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
remover that's found in your tool kit

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.600 
remover that's found in your tool kit
that<00:03:13.330> comes<00:03:13.780> with<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.110> bike<00:03:14.460> you<00:03:15.460> can

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
that comes with the bike you can

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.720 
that comes with the bike you can
actually<00:03:15.790> do<00:03:16.120> it<00:03:16.270> without<00:03:17.400> pulling<00:03:18.400> out<00:03:18.550> the

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
actually do it without pulling out the

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.680 
actually do it without pulling out the
engine<00:03:20.250> bolts<00:03:21.250> and<00:03:21.520> drop<00:03:21.970> in<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.210> engine<00:03:22.510> so

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
engine bolts and drop in the engine so

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.560 
engine bolts and drop in the engine so
we'll<00:03:23.380> start<00:03:23.650> with<00:03:24.060> this<00:03:25.060> plug<00:03:25.330> right<00:03:25.360> here

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
we'll start with this plug right here

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.520 
we'll start with this plug right here
basically<00:03:26.560> you<00:03:27.270> just<00:03:28.270> press<00:03:28.870> on<00:03:29.050> this<00:03:29.230> clip

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
basically you just press on this clip

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.580 
basically you just press on this clip
and<00:03:29.800> then<00:03:30.040> pull<00:03:30.280> out<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:31.560> connector<00:03:32.560> that

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
and then pull out the connector that

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.970 
and then pull out the connector that
goes<00:03:32.770> to<00:03:33.130> that<00:03:33.250> particular<00:03:33.550> spark<00:03:34.030> plug<00:03:34.300> and

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
goes to that particular spark plug and

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.260 
goes to that particular spark plug and
then<00:03:35.980> what<00:03:36.070> you<00:03:36.190> want<00:03:36.340> to<00:03:36.370> do<00:03:36.550> is<00:03:36.850> work<00:03:37.120> the

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
then what you want to do is work the

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:45.449 
then what you want to do is work the
spark<00:03:40.270> plug<00:03:40.600> stem<00:03:41.200> out<00:03:42.090> and<00:03:44.010> that<00:03:45.010> way<00:03:45.190> you<00:03:45.250> can

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
spark plug stem out and that way you can

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.820 
spark plug stem out and that way you can
access<00:03:45.670> your<00:03:46.030> spark<00:03:46.330> plug<00:03:46.540> now<00:03:47.110> I<00:03:47.350> found<00:03:47.680> that

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
access your spark plug now I found that

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
access your spark plug now I found that
these<00:03:48.070> are<00:03:48.220> a<00:03:48.250> little<00:03:48.400> bit<00:03:48.610> difficult

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
these are a little bit difficult

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.790 
these are a little bit difficult
sometimes<00:03:49.420> you<00:03:49.720> can't<00:03:49.959> but<00:03:50.500> they've<00:03:50.650> been<00:03:50.770> in

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
sometimes you can't but they've been in

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.110 
sometimes you can't but they've been in
there<00:03:51.010> for<00:03:51.220> a<00:03:51.250> while<00:03:51.370> they're<00:03:51.610> hard<00:03:51.820> to<00:03:51.880> pull

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
there for a while they're hard to pull

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.590 
there for a while they're hard to pull
out<00:03:52.300> I<00:03:52.600> may<00:03:53.110> not<00:03:53.260> be<00:03:53.410> able<00:03:53.470> to<00:03:53.590> do<00:03:53.739> it<00:03:53.860> by<00:03:53.980> hand

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
out I may not be able to do it by hand

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.020 
out I may not be able to do it by hand
I'll<00:03:55.600> give<00:03:55.750> it<00:03:55.840> a<00:03:55.900> try

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
I'll give it a try

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.740 
I'll give it a try
it's<00:03:58.030> tight<00:03:59.700> I'm<00:04:00.700> having<00:04:01.030> difficulty<00:04:01.540> see

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
it's tight I'm having difficulty see

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.530 
it's tight I'm having difficulty see
what<00:04:01.900> you<00:04:02.050> need<00:04:02.200> to<00:04:02.350> do
