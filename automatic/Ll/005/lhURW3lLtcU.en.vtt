00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:19.919
 with my day my name is limoux and I work for scorpions I am the 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:22.609
 mathias technician all agree we are currently in 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.399
 repetition all by hand by Hanover studio our hometown we we 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:29.699
 prepare the tour of the new scorpions album i will introduce you the 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.699
 matthias system s months of salary 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.809
 here is the pedal that started everything 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:38.360
 this is the place of 'fight what would have sown 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.060
 we use since we had a problem in mexico we had 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.629
 play in a stadium in front of about 40,000 people 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.139
 and play in that sense of metropolis always very stressful but we have 

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:50.309
 often surprises for lexical decoders I mounted the equipment 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.370
 maintaining if I found that a huge one where they circulate throughout the 

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:57.960
 system one is more important than the signal itself actually one was capturing a 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.899
 radio station and I really did not know why because when we 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.989
 removes the internal system becomes very sensitive to the kinds of things and 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.050
 we had perfect illustration 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.400
 but because he likes to do things to weapons 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.040
 I really did not know how we are going to be able to make the consequences 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.320
 especially in desperation I tried the god of pens and that was 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.710
 market certainly because going out and b are totally isolated one of 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.210
 the other 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.369
 social this dinosaur daddy ps we learn maisonnier I can not you 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.220
 explain how nor why but it worked we could do the 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.240
 concert I was relieved 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.640
 yeah like the word 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.640
 homeless that's how it all started 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.679
 scarf 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:39.449
 one for mathias guitar under-using two transmitters more than one 

00:01:39.449 --> 00:01:42.729
 blocking third in case the transmitters would break down all those suspicions 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.929
 related instead of 6 8 points harder and those who manage the three signed 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.740
 I have done for example here I activate editors on the channel 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.850
 detailed 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.340
 the impact of these practices his findings on the switch depp the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.890
 signal is mutated otherwise the immune system 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.670
 he uses his functions when changing stars but also for a 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.020
 camp instruments very quickly between two pieces should refrain 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.440
 of ramadan table this moment the signal is mutated which 6 baffled on the rope 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.209
 hours because it has two outputs for inputs 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.159
 by agnès the mother as personally I use exit for 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:15.549
 power amps and the other for the rope there is more to choose one 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:18.849
 or the other depending on the situation while the right hand one could 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.399
 also use output to switch between two different amps but this 

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:26.019
 is not necessarily case since I also have the dual castillo esp which him 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.699
 is programmable the advantage is that I have the opportunity to pass on a 

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:31.239
 corner very quickly after the facts it works with the three 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.659
 inputs they do not need additional switches 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:36.339
 when I'm on insufficiently supported to mount signal 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:39.379
 give it the guitar and it also works with the input is when the 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.890
 guitar connected by a cable instead of a transmitter 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.540
 but it worked so everything can go very very fast that's what I 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.540
 want i can m 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.269
 to Besancon and his men are leaving are currently in the process of 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.279
 prepare the new tour the group will present new pieces drawn 

00:02:57.279 --> 00:02:58.489
 of the next album 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.569
 jasmine and added a place on Oct 10 would have his evening to handle the effects 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.359
 what would these distortions and the new laws necessary for the new 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.749
 pieces would give up the guns added on August 10 because I do not want 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:11.310
 not that the effects remain in the signal flow when they are not 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.469
 used a hotelier in the country as chairman programmable and allows 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:17.669
 remove the effects of the 55 'signal flow of soubré passes 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.260
 for a sum there like that while he's in the loop there I put the 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.469
 distortion and chorus what I want and you want to activate with this switch 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.240
 here and there but why take care of it 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.340
 missed the pedalo and in the budget loop 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.390
 a little more than ten years I can use no more as a man of 10 lots 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.760
 that I play or just one press all fully programmable so it 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.340
 just press a single switch to see the desired configuration 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.140
 0:29 and the space of a sound volume effect that we use and the 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.260
 quality requirements of the group I want everyone who is not used 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.140
 removed from the signal stream and that's exactly what October 10th does to 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.499
 Geneva with Paris 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:56.899
 in other words I can add or remove very easily the effects of 

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:59.909
 the loop do you want bullet-proof heavy trucks or pay 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:03.079
 at each new test conducted that our currency we have europe 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.079
 they add the loops yet the pause chorus 

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:10.559
 lack of sleep loop 

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:13.559
 I also have the distortion pedal 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.720
 but it's not the threats but we do not hear clearly breath you have 

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:26.870
 noticed that he does not come from May 10th to 13th of these two women's pedals 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.029
 corrupted nothing remembers it especially distortion because the wine 

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:31.140
 is very very high 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.920
 but also a bit of the corruption puzzle is one of the reasons for 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.100
 which I want to be able to completely remove both pedals from the stream 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.930
 of breathtaking signal disappears the duo does exactly what I want 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.560
 as I say but I can always activated at who makes the loop a 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.330
 deep delivery in this Lombard derby recalled in group b i 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.400
 put the country of Loire 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.300
 unlike the others this field is placed on the hot seat and like scorpion 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.820
 on a very big stage sometimes even in stadiums 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.210
 it takes at least 20 meters of cable to the other 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.930
 seven hundred million cards very important can cause degradations 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.070
 of the signal it increases the risks that a connector will be disconnected 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:07.090
 accidentally private he threw a veil of new reasons for 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.030
 which I do not want the pedal to stay constantly in the signal flow 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.830
 this is the way to school 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.000
 we gave up gas she had also sang at a channel like 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.330
 once there are audible degradations 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.599
 I can add more coveted so claimed up to + 12 8% for 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:24.199
 increase the level is offset the great length of 4 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.889
 it is true that the bluffer more or less strong according to my needs 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:29.479
 this relationship with the ashes of the actor 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:32.860
 like that of the ape between everything is fully programmable here by 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.789
 example I have a thousand euros more than a year earlier for a term in the 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:36.639
 loop 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:40.069
 so just a single press of the button b to activate them all 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:43.530
 two of a sudden pressing on I did not run on the distortions in the 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.889
 signal flow while deleting more buffer and voice because they are 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:49.889
 useless in the manceaux 18 singers account 

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:55.729
 because for this purpose the signal is sent in two amps which 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:59.260
 simultaneously operate nantes to this is added a mole mole 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.940
 which is used separately or in parallel with the two years later one 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.860
 can therefore have the three signals at the same time abbas oral to balazed by the 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.650
 through his Mosson throat 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.580
 the general system will hold the residuals as the exits and the 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.540
 bidules duale question is simple are totally isolated one with respect to 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.210
 the other is exactly what I need not generally more and more 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.210
 they work simultaneously 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.499
 wario show I can turn off the second time country 

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:30.849
 add it to the first 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.710
 better only the second empire 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:40.779
 mayor 

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:45.009
 I repeat that there is no more noise than the output vtt this place is not so 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:47.369
 problem to complete the match 

00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:50.179
 annan are with me as I already said the system also includes 

00:06:50.179 --> 00:06:51.219
 a boxing tower 

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:54.669
 I can program together according to my needs I was hoping it will be 

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:58.279
 switch here the left switch not corresponds to the main configuration 

00:06:58.279 --> 00:07:01.360
 with two simultaneous amps the central switch athens the 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.969
 rate configuration we came out are tactile that only included more 

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:07.969
 boxing gear 

00:07:09.819 --> 00:07:13.020
 montanari finally the right switch enough matches a confirmation 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.249
 extra for the pieces like two sous for mathias plays solo i 

00:07:17.249 --> 00:07:20.249
 been only the boxing mole without the other two filled 

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:29.730
 the fact that everything is program greatly facilitates my work I can everything 

00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:33.580
 control directly from the site there is no breath or loop tomorrow at this level 

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.899
 and switching except those generated by the storm is ideal 

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:42.020
 an easy task where do we go father was hot the pub that's exactly what 

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.740
 which I need and it works very well 

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.729
 note that at the start of the United States has no breakdown buttons are 

00:07:46.729 --> 00:07:50.319
 extremely strong there is no real switching nor any loop of 

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:53.400
 mascouche has the gift of self the decline of purchases not like rome 

00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:55.649
 in this direction 

00:07:55.649 --> 00:07:56.339
 for tonight
