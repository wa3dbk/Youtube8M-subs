00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello everyone we meet today 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.350
 for the test 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.200
 the comparative rather between the iphone 5 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.809
 on the left and the word dauger on the right so 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.190
 the motogp almost four times cheaper 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.170
 than the iphone 5 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.150
 and that's why we're going to see that 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.090
 that he has in his stomach facing a big 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.980
 market tenor we will start all of 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.849
 followed by a little research on 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.699
 internet to test speed 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.679
 so we dance if you want to see the 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.520
 technical specificities of each of the 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.200
 appliances 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.610
 I already made videos previously 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.210
 who find you who will show you in 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.030
 detail 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.980
 that is that each device has the only 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.300
 difference that I can tell you there 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.860
 that's where it's android and the crs 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.440
 other specificity there is a dual core 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.010
 clocked 1.3 and keeps the quad core saa 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.010
 clocked at 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.990
 3 I also care if I'm not mistaken 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.800
 so we'll start here it's all from 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:09.610
 following a search and we will launch the 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:12.910
 apple.com site only point like a two 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.610
 three or even who has the fastest fast 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.020
 well it's the fastest iphone 5 for 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.120
 internet search 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.479
 it's a bit normal because ios is 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.330
 completely optimized with the devices 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.070
 while android is universal 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.229
 there are full appliances so we can 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.830
 not optimize for each device 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.210
 so we will leave that we saw the 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.970
 research on the Internet 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.960
 we will empty the multitasking on each side 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:46.630
 flat hop pop out there and we will do 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:49.660
 a test on a game that takes a lot of 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.070
 ram of RAM which is asphalt 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.490
 so I launched on both devices 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:02:00.030
 we're going to launch that at the same time 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:02.590
 started a little faster on the iphone 5 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.690
 here we could see the iphone 5 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.750
 expect ahead of the motogp but 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:13.330
 that's not why moto gl in the race 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:15.010
 fast solo courcelon fast nevada 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.340
 class says neva classes d choose 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.670
 choose next and we will launch this in 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.670
 same time 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.810
 it started a little at the same time and we 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.810
 go see what it gives 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.040
 Well, contrary to popular belief 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.250
 it's the bike I started more 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:43.290
 quickly that the iphone 5 is surely due to 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:45.660
 its quad core processor so level was 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.510
 to iter there will be no difference 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.610
 it's the same on both devices 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.100
 so I do not think I can 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.380
 play with both devices at the same 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:59.580
 time ah because I'm really a 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:05.160
 big boss but me it's not my name so 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:07.560
 here we go I go a little divine in 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:12.840
 first step but good I'm dead in 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:14.220
 below them a little late actually in 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.540
 beneath so that's good ben you see 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:22.110
 that the bike I did not do at all 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:24.599
 small go phase go 25 and even 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.120
 pretty good what could we 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.709
 test one more search on youtube 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.030
 we start an advertisement then as you 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.790
 can see that but still a little 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.260
 more time to start on the bike 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.519
 I then we will sell them and videos 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.350
 popular one is in popular then 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:45.590
 of popular then when the same video 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:48.090
 so that there is no cheating 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.130
 it's weird the popular videos on 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.319
 this is not exactly the same 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:57.060
 yellow letters is above for short 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:04:00.239
 Here c is cobb vs messi 3-2 not 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.620
 her party began a little less 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:07.560
 time to start on the iphone 5 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:10.019
 that's it, well, you see the motogp and 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.489
 faster than the iphone 5 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:13.350
 it might sound crazy for a 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.720
 device that costs less here's by 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.019
 against if it rakes is that it is the 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.019
 Wireless 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.199
 louis son did not all alas like 

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:24.000
 I have two devices connected excuse 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:29.460
 I was not very well framed good you 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.900
 have seen the motogp and iphone 5 and ben 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.729
 are almost evenly managed same as 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.009
 faster motogp than iphone 5 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.419
 so for those who buy a motorcycle 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:37.800
 I really try not bad choice 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.659
 if I did not have the phone I 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.680
 currently i think i would have 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:45.180
 bought a motorcycle I level what level 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.550
 value for money this really 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.169
 excellent but you can not even imagine 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.849
 which point 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.490
 good by cons for the camera and well the 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:54.960
 motogp and lower is largely 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.779
 lower the iphone 5 because the iphone 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:01.199
 5 is the binomial pixels and the cdu 5 

00:04:57.779 --> 00:05:03.509
 so there is not much 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:05.789
 demonstrated what I could you 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:06.509
 show others and ben for a little 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:11.819
 quick test 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:12.960
 it may be already not bad after I 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:15.270
 can not do any tests 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.680
 opening application because 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:21.229
 it's not the same operating system 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:23.240
 watch i open the sms i can not 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:24.599
 I can not do you any tests of 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.050
 speed 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:29.909
 because these are not the ones 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.159
 not exactly the same systems 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:38.190
 of exploitation we're just going to compare the 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:39.839
 place and google call store 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.629
 and the app store excuse me I come from 

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:44.669
 to see I wished too well ben me I 

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:50.339
 prefers on the other hand there I prefer 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:52.740
 largely the interface of at apple which 

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:53.729
 makes me be the most addictive then 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.009
 that there for example you are looking for a 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:59.250
 category where is what to read 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:01.409
 but the teeth I do not know 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.490
 no ah yes well here is above you 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:05.550
 are not many categories then 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.110
 the category level you are used 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.360
 for there you have five who are 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.610
 presented a game not say but it's not 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.520
 your balloon after we go straight to folds in 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:17.759
 the app we go the category we go in the 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:20.930
 game while the game by category 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:24.449
 we'll go right after I went 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:26.129
 game style wedge Boy was pungent 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:28.080
 high arcade falls on it 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:28.650
 we will try to find his head the 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.250
 blinds 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.210
 so as I said category 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:39.060
 now we will start from the beginning 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:41.370
 So here we welcome the Crestor game 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.740
 moves category category games 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:45.090
 arcade and actions it's still 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:49.259
 a little more time after after 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:51.180
 recommendations after times the top 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:53.160
 article makes a top free articles 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.810
 the most profitable all novelties 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.600
 pay 9 august and free ok ok you 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:07:00.960
 have more category 2 in there you

 have paid free and profitable good 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.180
 after that it's a matter of taste but 

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:07.919
 me for me I prefer the system 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:09.600
 operating ios the a71 cg gallas to 8 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:12.510
 gigabyte giga survival and you pretty much have 

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:15.449
 5 6 giga live there on 16 giga you 

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:18.630
 have it very and khaliq so here 

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:21.240
 I hope you liked this test I know 

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:22.620
 not what to tell you anymore if not 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.590
 to go see my presentation videos 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:27.780
 of the iphone 5 and the bike I have as well as 

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:31.919
 comparative test between motorcycle g and greek 

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:34.860
 6.3 between the S4 motogp between the galaxy s 

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:36.150
 4 and iphone 5 we will see you on 

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.830

 week you have game solutions 

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.849
 for example four images at monique corn 

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:47.010
 stuff like that 

00:07:44.849 --> 00:07:50.250
