it's<00:05:56.600> up<00:05:56.750> to<00:05:56.840> them<00:05:56.990> but<00:05:57.350> it<00:05:57.830> may<00:05:58.250> be<00:05:58.400> optimistic

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
it's up to them but it may be optimistic

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.610 
it's up to them but it may be optimistic
I<00:05:59.090> would<00:05:59.240> say<00:05:59.360> very<00:05:59.510> likely<00:05:59.810> I<00:06:00.140> would<00:06:00.320> say

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620
