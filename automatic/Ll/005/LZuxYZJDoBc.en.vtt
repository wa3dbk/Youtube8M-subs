00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.020 
Canadian knows only too well that he
possesses<00:03:21.859> one<00:03:22.250> of<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.370> most<00:03:22.640> intimidating

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
possesses one of the most intimidating

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.530 
possesses one of the most intimidating
shots<00:03:23.720> in<00:03:24.260> the<00:03:24.410> game<00:03:24.639> my<00:03:25.639> service<00:03:26.030> definitely

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
shots in the game my service definitely

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.750 
shots in the game my service definitely
the<00:03:26.660> most<00:03:26.750> important<00:03:27.260> thing<00:03:27.410> I<00:03:27.560> think<00:03:27.760> playing

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
the most important thing I think playing

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.550 
the most important thing I think playing
poorly<00:03:29.030> if<00:03:29.239> I<00:03:29.329> serve<00:03:29.540> well<00:03:29.750> it'll<00:03:29.989> still<00:03:30.380> keep

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
poorly if I serve well it'll still keep

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.860 
poorly if I serve well it'll still keep
me<00:03:30.709> in<00:03:30.799> a<00:03:30.889> match<00:03:31.069> and<00:03:31.450> maybe<00:03:32.450> things<00:03:32.750> will

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
me in a match and maybe things will

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.330 
me in a match and maybe things will
change<00:03:32.930> at<00:03:33.500> one<00:03:33.650> point<00:03:33.829> throughout<00:03:34.069> a<00:03:34.130> match

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
change at one point throughout a match

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.530 
change at one point throughout a match
so<00:03:34.549> I<00:03:34.579> think<00:03:34.730> it's<00:03:35.030> definitely<00:03:35.209> something

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
so I think it's definitely something

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.420 
so I think it's definitely something
very<00:03:36.170> very<00:03:36.350> important<00:03:36.829> and<00:03:37.100> then<00:03:37.250> obviously

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
very very important and then obviously

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.710 
very very important and then obviously
i'm<00:03:37.819> trying<00:03:38.030> to<00:03:38.120> improve<00:03:38.299> on<00:03:38.450> many<00:03:38.660> other

i'm trying to improve on many other

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
shot after the serve and I've improved

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.849 
shot after the serve and I've improved
my<00:03:43.310> return<00:03:43.609> game<00:03:43.790> I<00:03:44.590> don't<00:03:45.590> think<00:03:45.620> there's

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 
my return game I don't think there's

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:48.039

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
think the only one is really how many

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.069 
think the only one is really how many
times<00:03:49.970> they<00:03:50.239> bounce<00:03:50.420> the<00:03:50.540> ball<00:03:50.660> before<00:03:50.840> my
