00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.720
 ae 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.200
 is 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.070
 ae 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.079
 ae 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:05.470
 there when mac donald ritchie here and 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.110
 today a cell of a bomb 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.580
 exactly this very powerful vehicle 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.950
 loved by some who are hated by others who are 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.760
 present in the conquest large modes in 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.650
 A few rush ways, guys, I'm going today. 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.330
 talk a little bit about it and try 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.800
 pass some tips based on 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.750
 gaming experiences not that I am the 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.580
 Face more rain I can even make a 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.860
 legal agreement with him 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.430
 so let's go where it was also known 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:35.030
 by acronym aa has two models one of them 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:38.869
 is the link which is sent from the atoa 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.950
 united states is and 19 cava22 that was the 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.360
 Russian side 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.759
 the only difference between these two 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.920
 vehicles is what is levy 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.990
 it is also an amphibious vehicle or 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.970
 that you can get in the water with him already 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.460
 can be a great advantage without 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.890
 they realize they can use this 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.240
 so come on, a little bit of how to play 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.710
 with 10 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.930
 I think one of the main tips 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.440
 government always only doing wrong in the 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.970
 My opinion is that you stand in the 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.510
 own base on the basis that I want in 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.850
 City 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.679
 I think today was meant to be well used 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.860
 You have to keep on getting around. 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.480
 closer to the enemy base than 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.100
 issue of kiss but hype for you 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.560
 be ready for when they appear 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.660
 You already start attacking 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.760
 in addition the guy who stands in the 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.769
 own base that will find much 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.470
 few aerial media that taught 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:30.530
 easy for jets and helicopters as per 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.090
 example TVZ rock xipote do not have to 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.590
 only worry that the flights already 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.820
 destroying the vehicle will be of great 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.320
 help for your team 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.430
 besides you gain many points to 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:43.489
 this now to destroy god jets 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.370
 I use quite the sixers they high 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.840
 was icm gmail already has another one there with 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.140
 sure will get what I am one 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.459
 coach as he is very close by 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.269
 now on the helicopter issue I see 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.160
 many people 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.170
 attacking the helicopter with Ricky when 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.880
 He is extremely close to you. 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.160
 primary smell is very strong so do not 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.230
 Are you afraid to use it and how are you going to see it? 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.239
 this scene all the matter of movements and 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.950
 movement with the rogÃ©rio is 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.410
 It's difficult for your friends to try you. 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.360
 solve that scene that even the enemy 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.870
 the rpg of me because they are on the move 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.870
 same 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.620
 now you will see that we are 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.060
 moving backward while the 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.829
 helicopter and everything only in the 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.329
 even you can see that it is 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:27.329
 very easy to destroy the helicopter 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.129
 now you will see a scene that the 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:34.780
 money is not only he not he gives 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:41.290
 damage if the tank could help in 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:43.269
 some cases here fighting against 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.639
 engineer and could give rebound himself 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.530
 then their team would be very weak but 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:50.829
 If you want to win a game, it's just Rogerio. 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:56.439
 that my friend you will be able to finish 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:04:00.450
 with his air defense and of course stay 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:00.450
 always attentive to our friend c4 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.560
 But then guys, I think I got it. 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.110
 pass a message to show 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.690
 You as the smell is strong as the 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.940
 money makes a difference in a team that 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.310
 has a good face anti-aircraft like good jet 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.850
 on a team it's good you practically 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:21.700
 destroys another team for example where it was 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.650
 fair jet already everything antiaircraft that helped 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.930
 he will drink and everything will fall 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.180
 we are helping each other on the team and 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.340
 I will give as an example I swear that 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.470
 we play together in matches is not like 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.600
 when it's being attacked I help him 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.490
 when I leave the house he helps me and so 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.530
 the two wins in fact the team 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.720
 whole wins because it stays that way. 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.000
 It's much easier for the team to catch the 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.500
 getting around on the map but that's not what 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.110
 I hope they sounded 20 if you 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.180
 like you know there evaluates comments 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.890
 mainly comments that we like 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.510
 enough to read your comment and 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.220
 If you have any questions, can you? 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.800
 comment and that for sure you will be 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:00.810
 Answered so I'm going from a 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.810
