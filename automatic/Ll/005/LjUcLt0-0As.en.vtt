00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.990
 if none 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:39.150
 isabella magacho area the hello beauty i 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.880
 I liked it so much, I fell pretty 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.620
 first a hit in the 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.150
 james blunt choice of music is 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.730
 a great artist a great composer 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.200
 and unfortunately some time now no no 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.450
 did no job of great success 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.220
 like those big hits that clean as 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.380
 one after another and you succeeded 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.090
 remember that a little and brought to 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.910
 people an interpretation completely 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:02.430
 Yours has done everything right in the 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:05.840
 and it was much better than the 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:09.330
 last week to 10 nor the law already 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:12.570
 danielli looks isabella 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.340
 I bet you because you have 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.920
 presented very well and I particularly 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.320
 like a lot is chose a song too 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.030
 good it made the dynamics that the music requested 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.220
 the interpretation which is very 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.680
 important agreement was then 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:29.970
 good presentation you are very well 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:33.330
 Entering free gazelle I really liked the 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:35.670
 Your presentation today and I like to see 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.800
 without the guitar and had thought you 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.990
 It needs to work out very well. 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.880
 there are comfortable people who get 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.400
 so misfits in your instrument 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.410
 and you did very well 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.660
 You put such a bow in the 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:52.050
 at the beginning of the song that gave 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.010
 March 11 bird and then he let out his voice and I 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:57.570
 I think I really liked it 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:59.700
 I really liked it, man. Look at you already. 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.440
 deserved a compliment just because he had 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.600
 come here sing a song by james 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:07.860
 blunt that was not that horrible 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.930
 beautiful it is already obvious that jack a terror 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.460
 She denied ours for the love of god I 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:16.020
 I'd rather wash my eyes with ground glass. 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:18.120
 than to listen to what we look at 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.850
 interpretation was an interpretation of you 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.610
 I was safe in the song you committed. 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:25.920
 some very imperceptible glides in 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.110
 in terms of tonality in the 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:31.470
 songs, it's no use looking, that's it 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:33.750
 now be careful is in that sun sets the 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:37.020
 sheet sets that you put 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:39.510
 at 7 o'clock in alcochete is thus all the 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:43.430
 Sir, I was going to play a joke. 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:46.850
 and a footprint is not always obliging 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:50.370
 edson sanches joke 

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:53.220
 so now the party now from 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:56.010
 Now you're not going to rely on the 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:58.680
 my good mood a humorous card with 

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:02.070
 the hole is not good is not that it is 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.630
 this average is up to the personal question for 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:06.090
 I put you're pulled so I told 

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:08.880
 I'm not much worse 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:10.950
 talk so be careful because the 

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.110
 Voicemail often comes close. 

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:16.380
 of the singer of the exchange says to 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:18.690
 riordan and it 's a timbre a little chatinho de 

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:21.750
 listen then you think it's clear 

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:28.320
 That to me, it's obvious, it went well. 

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:31.110
 reasonably well it was marli marley eu 

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:34.169
 not life again but for me it was a 

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:38.930
 thankful surprise may be right for me 

00:07:34.169 --> 00:07:38.930
 You went divinely well. 

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:48.550
 that's right group continues
