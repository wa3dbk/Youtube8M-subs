end all right so explaining the key of e
I'm<00:00:50.050> starting<00:00:50.800> with<00:00:50.980> a<00:00:51.250> band<00:00:51.730> on<00:00:51.969> the<00:00:52.089> g<00:00:52.269> string

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
I'm starting with a band on the g string

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.660 
I'm starting with a band on the g string
on<00:00:52.600> the<00:00:52.690> second<00:00:52.989> fret<00:00:53.019> and<00:00:53.410> then<00:00:53.890> I<00:00:54.160> have<00:00:54.489> the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
on the second fret and then I have the

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.750 
on the second fret and then I have the
bottom<00:00:55.420> strings<00:00:55.749> below<00:00:56.440> open<00:00:56.920> the<00:00:57.280> B<00:00:57.460> and<00:00:57.670> E

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
bottom strings below open the B and E

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.619 
bottom strings below open the B and E
string<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.800> then<00:01:00.699> I'm<00:01:00.850> going<00:01:01.089> to<00:01:01.120> the<00:01:01.329> D

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
string and then I'm going to the D

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:14.100 
string and then I'm going to the D
string<00:01:01.690> E<00:01:04.920> string<00:01:08.730> so<00:01:09.730> we<00:01:09.820> get<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:13.090> then<00:01:14.020> the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
string E string so we get and then the

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:21.180 
string E string so we get and then the
last<00:01:14.290> part<00:01:17.190> b<00:01:18.190> string<00:01:19.320> g<00:01:20.320> string<00:01:20.350> and<00:01:20.770> here<00:01:21.040> I'm

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
last part b string g string and here I'm

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.840 
last part b string g string and here I'm
bending<00:01:22.440> half<00:01:23.440> step<00:01:23.740> and<00:01:24.630> then<00:01:25.630> I<00:01:26.700> released<00:01:27.700> a

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
bending half step and then I released a

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.100 
bending half step and then I released a
band<00:01:28.090> without<00:01:28.390> actually<00:01:29.010> playing<00:01:30.010> the<00:01:30.130> note

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
band without actually playing the note

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.870 
band without actually playing the note
so<00:01:32.110> it<00:01:32.200> means<00:01:32.770> I'm<00:01:32.950> doing<00:01:33.040> a<00:01:33.190> pull<00:01:33.370> off<00:01:33.520> from

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
so it means I'm doing a pull off from

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.810 
so it means I'm doing a pull off from
the<00:01:33.970> second<00:01:34.300> fret<00:01:34.510> on<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:34.870> g<00:01:35.830> string<00:01:35.860> to<00:01:36.310> open
