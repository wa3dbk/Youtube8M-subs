00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.120
 further right from the same place you need 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.480
 do the same thing i have again i 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:17.550
 must dial 17 air loops and to 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:22.520
 one, two, three, 4, 5, and so on, that is 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.520
 only 17 will always be the same 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.619
 so here I have 2 chain and on it I 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.510
 do i see exactly the same petal then 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:48.690
 I have the first column without 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:56.460
 nakida 2 I will be solid and on 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:01:04.100
 I went to the posts with one nap; and 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:07.560
 so on so here I tied a petal 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.689
 almost to the end I have 2 left here 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.280
 eyelets 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:13.970
 I knit the last but one sturdy 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.970
 a column 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:23.549
 and the last loop I knit 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:31.259
 nakida column and I already have two 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:34.320
 petals so on will need to tie 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.680
 next petal and so on all 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.829
 well here's a big daisy here on this one 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.079
 me connected 17 that is just you 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.850
 impose petals and then they need 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:49.490
 will connect i will show 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.490
 after i tie all the petals 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:02:01.630
 so here I tied 17 petals with me 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:04.570
 it turned out such a thread on which these 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.119
 petals all then they are natural 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:11.170
 will be straightened ie chamomile will need 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:14.489
 wet spread the petals and she already 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.620
 will look like this 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.480
 so now I will make it easier that is 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:25.330
 you need to straighten this one 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:27.700
 line and collect all the petals together in 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.680
 the center here seems to be very 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.800
 a big circle turns out he actually 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:42.130
 will be small when we collect both 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:47.980
 collect now I will show and so do 2 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:49.870
 air loops so on I'll 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.959
 collect from the center that is it from me 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:57.600
 for the first petal but from the next 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:03:00.130
 I will collect knit in the center 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:04.709
 a loop that is just i will need 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:08.820
 pull the thread like this 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.820
 then the next petal 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:21.910
 we pull out then the following that is all 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.049
 these loops will be in this 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:28.470
 hook moment 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:28.470
 that is, you need to collect all the petals 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:42.349
 so here I collected all the petals on 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:46.129
 hook and now neatly need 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:48.299
 pull the thread through all the loops 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:51.060
 I recommend here immediately after all not 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.950
 stretch and pull there through 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:59.000
 two or three 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:04:05.030
 so as not to lose the thread that is 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.030
 this way we continue to fix 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.680
 eyelet 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.849
 that is, in the end we get here 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.849
 such a daisy 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:27.690
 so here I will relate one more loop 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:31.409
 to tighten the thread and further thread 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:34.009
 can be trimmed and after you 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:36.720
 you can do it right away and a 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:38.430
 petals i.e. it needs to be wetted and 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:43.050
 spread out on some flat 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:45.690
 surfaces so that these petals are on 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.720
 so were not going to shod 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:57.000
 exactly all that we have now 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:05:03.210
 It turned out that I will cut it now 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:05.629
 thread and tie a bind here are the two tail 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:09.349
 between themselves 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:09.349
 I see with the beginning of knitting 

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:17.389
 so that's half of us in 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:24.810
 principle ready now need to tie 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:27.029
 the middle after you bring it 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.039
 here is the proper kind that is straighten and 

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:32.819
 petals you get this here 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:35.460
 daisy and now here it will be necessary 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:40.099
 first cook the middle and then her 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.099
 bind to ready-made petals
