could be a real blessing if you have a

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
you want your kids to practice but maybe

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.460 
you want your kids to practice but maybe
you<00:04:46.550> want<00:04:46.760> to<00:04:46.790> be<00:04:46.910> doing<00:04:47.120> something<00:04:47.450> else<00:04:47.570> how

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
you want to be doing something else how

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.280

to<00:04:48.500> solve<00:04:49.400> that<00:04:49.520> problem<00:04:49.690> the<00:04:50.690> middle<00:04:51.080> pedal

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
to solve that problem the middle pedal

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.430 
to solve that problem the middle pedal
locks<00:04:51.770> in<00:04:52.130> and<00:04:52.490> makes<00:04:53.300> for<00:04:53.540> a<00:04:53.600> practice<00:04:54.020> pedal

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
locks in and makes for a practice pedal

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.290 
locks in and makes for a practice pedal
it<00:04:54.770> doesn't<00:04:55.130> change<00:04:55.310> the<00:04:55.520> feel<00:04:55.730> of<00:04:55.760> the<00:04:55.970> piano

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
it doesn't change the feel of the piano

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.960 
it doesn't change the feel of the piano
but<00:04:56.960> it<00:04:57.080> certainly<00:04:57.350> makes<00:04:57.950> the<00:04:58.160> sound<00:04:58.430> much

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
but it certainly makes the sound much

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:24.010 
but it certainly makes the sound much
quieter<00:05:09.910> compared<00:05:10.910> to<00:05:22.480> so<00:05:23.480> if<00:05:23.690> you<00:05:23.780> have<00:05:23.930> the

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
quieter compared to so if you have the

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.230 
quieter compared to so if you have the
space<00:05:24.320> for<00:05:24.590> an<00:05:24.680> upright<00:05:25.100> and<00:05:25.430> you're<00:05:25.940> looking

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
space for an upright and you're looking

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.150 
space for an upright and you're looking
for<00:05:26.390> a<00:05:26.420> high-quality<00:05:26.780> upright<00:05:27.770> that<00:05:27.890> gives<00:05:28.070> a

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
for a high-quality upright that gives a

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.850 
for a high-quality upright that gives a
