00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
video I found how to do it for Windows

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.609 
video I found how to do it for Windows
because<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.369> actually<00:02:02.700> do<00:02:02.969> not<00:02:03.119> know<00:02:03.329> but<00:02:04.320> to

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
because I actually do not know but to

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.310 
because I actually do not know but to
resize<00:02:05.549> all<00:02:05.939> these<00:02:06.149> at<00:02:06.329> one<00:02:06.509> time<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:07.020> make<00:02:07.170> it

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
resize all these at one time to make it

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.979 
resize all these at one time to make it
easier<00:02:07.770> for<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:08.069> guys<00:02:08.250> actually<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:09.000> mean

easier for you guys actually I mean

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.800 
easier for you guys actually I mean
backtrack<00:02:10.470> here<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:11.090> took<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.209> with<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.390> Nikon

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
backtrack here I took it with the Nikon

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.650 
backtrack here I took it with the Nikon
and<00:02:13.020> I<00:02:13.080> saw

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
and I saw

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.750 
and I saw
photos<00:02:13.960> went<00:02:14.170> onto<00:02:14.290> an<00:02:14.560> SD<00:02:14.890> card<00:02:14.920> memory<00:02:15.430> card

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
photos went onto an SD card memory card

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.000 
photos went onto an SD card memory card
so<00:02:16.360> then<00:02:16.510> I<00:02:16.600> just<00:02:16.750> put<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.080> memory<00:02:17.350> card<00:02:17.710> into

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
so then I just put the memory card into

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.700 
so then I just put the memory card into
the<00:02:18.250> computer<00:02:18.700> here<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:19.180> then<00:02:19.960> drag<00:02:20.560> them

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
the computer here and then drag them

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.620 
the computer here and then drag them
into<00:02:20.950> a<00:02:20.980> folder<00:02:21.430> here<00:02:21.460> so<00:02:22.060> however<00:02:22.270> you<00:02:22.450> guys

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
into a folder here so however you guys

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.600 
into a folder here so however you guys
need<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:22.930> get<00:02:23.080> your<00:02:23.260> your<00:02:23.830> photos<00:02:24.280> on<00:02:24.490> your

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
computer go ahead and do that and then

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.480

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
large the largest size of the fit of the

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.010 
large the largest size of the fit of the
photo<00:03:38.500> so<00:03:38.650> for<00:03:39.070> our<00:03:39.190> case<00:03:39.430> we<00:03:39.550> want<00:03:39.670> 600<00:03:40.330> and<00:03:40.480> it

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
photo so for our case we want 600 and it

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.440 
photo so for our case we want 600 and it
scaled<00:03:41.320> it<00:03:41.470> all<00:03:41.590> proportionally<00:03:42.280> and<00:03:42.880> so<00:03:43.360> you

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
scaled it all proportionally and so you

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.240 
scaled it all proportionally and so you
set<00:03:43.660> that<00:03:43.780> to<00:03:43.930> 600<00:03:44.470> and<00:03:44.650> you<00:03:44.860> hit<00:03:45.040> and-run<00:03:47.250> and

set that to 600 and you hit and-run and

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.620 
set that to 600 and you hit and-run and
you'll<00:03:48.370> see<00:03:48.550> here<00:03:48.760> it<00:03:48.850> says<00:03:48.880> workflow

table against the white wall and I tried

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:57.660 
table against the white wall and I tried
to<00:05:56.440> get<00:05:56.530> the<00:05:56.680> best<00:05:56.800> lighting<00:05:57.130> as<00:05:57.310> I<00:05:57.430> could<00:05:57.640> I

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:57.670 
to get the best lighting as I could I

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.370 
to get the best lighting as I could I
opened<00:05:58.030> the<00:05:58.090> blinds<00:05:58.510> to<00:05:58.630> get<00:05:58.750> it<00:05:58.840> in<00:05:58.990> there<00:05:59.200> and

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.640 
I think the photos came out all right
they're<00:06:03.220> not<00:06:03.340> the<00:06:03.460> best<00:06:03.670> but<00:06:03.970> they'll<00:06:04.450> work<00:06:04.750> so

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
they're not the best but they'll work so
