accidental<00:05:47.320> discovery<00:05:47.979> and<00:05:48.250> then<00:05:48.370> I<00:05:48.400> found

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
accidental discovery and then I found

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.190 
accidental discovery and then I found
out<00:05:48.760> later<00:05:48.820> that<00:05:49.090> people<00:05:49.479> actually<00:05:49.630> do<00:05:49.990> this

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
out later that people actually do this

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.409 
out later that people actually do this
is<00:05:50.560> um<00:05:51.550> I<00:05:52.030> use<00:05:52.360> my<00:05:52.539> blow<00:05:52.900> dryer<00:05:53.140> to<00:05:53.950> curl<00:05:54.220> them
