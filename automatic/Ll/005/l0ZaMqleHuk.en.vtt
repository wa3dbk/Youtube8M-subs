00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello to you, era of news broadcasts 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 in this video you will learn how 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.630
 disable shadowing users 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.809
 windows 10 and so let's start it all started 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.759
 what friends told me listen 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.130
 it would be cool to see your review on 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.760
 windows 10 and is it worth it 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.890
 updated 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.170
 why not I thought and decided 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.060
 borrow from a couple of weeks to better 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.150
 understand all its pros and cons 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.859
 and that's when I was ready to say 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.430
 windows 10 is better operating system 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.090
 of all time oh god it's 10 out of 10 just 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.030
 masterpiece 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.640
 I began to stumble more and more on different things 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.590
 kind of angry posts about what's new 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.899
 microsoft OSes watch your 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.640
 users and even the law 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.710
 proposed to introduce a prohibitive 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.750
 use this product and have a stork 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.610
 I really liked it smoothly and 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.500
 comfortable and beautiful and worth only 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.579
 direct x 12 magnifying 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.890
 gaming performance 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.379
 I had to look for ways like if not 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.750
 completely remove the surveillance then at least as 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.059
 then and minimize 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.159
 move from words to deeds the first thing we 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.990
 do this disable keylogger 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.180
 built-in utility that remembers 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.369
 keystroke and send them 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.780
 unknown where 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.000
 Aida I am not responsible for 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.500
 possible problems caused by these 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.750
 actions so as paragraph 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.630
 connection keylogger and I did not rely 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.430
 your knowledge about on a third-party resource and so 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.350
 press the key combination win 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.030
 p further enter regedit this command 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.729
 which allows us to call and editor 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:39.990
 registry click yes then go to 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:43.590
 tab glasses and local machines after to 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:47.479
 systems further carlin control set further 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.950
 services and look in this cluster 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:55.350
 information 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:58.770
 dmv apu service folder go to item 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.640
 start and change its value to 4 what am i 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:07.290
 already done further close the editor 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.840
 Registry run the program anti 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.250
 keylogger windows 10 on behalf of 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.980
 admin 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:21.860
 the program will ask if we are ready to launch 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:25.760
 the antiques of lagger we write with write again 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:29.660
 wai that we step agree and everything is given for 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.890
 continue press any key all 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.260
 after that we will only 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.739
 restart our computer and keylogger 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:40.569
 will be disabled i do this for now 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:46.180
 I will not go to the second method 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:49.670
 go to the parameters 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.650
 privacy and in fact disable 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.610
 all the ticks that we have here 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.230
 is located, that is, let's say we connect 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.319
 let the app use my 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.079
 advertisement recipient id 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:05.209
 accessing websites and the 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:08.540
 similar especially 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:11.120
 different points about the location of the camera and 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.190
 that sort of thing is to leave it 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.569
 permission is needed exactly by that application 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.880
 which it really uses 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:20.299
 For example, Iâ€™m a vibe, well, because I 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:26.900
 I do not understand why microsoft 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:29.120
 edge or paint in general would like to know how 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.299
 i look i look my camera then 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.340
 the same with the microphone that is with 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:38.480
 handwriting input and generally with all 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.260
 data let's not want to mail 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.889
 and calendars 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.500
 find out my contact list ie 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:48.650
 me to my microsoft account 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.239
 tied to Google account and contacts 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.150
 which is on my phone 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:55.220
 Accordingly, there is an account 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.599
 microsoft but why does it need mail and 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:02.170
 calendar I do not know, and in general 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:07.190
 disable all items here which 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:08.840
 cause you resentment that's all 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.139
 there were all the ways I knew about 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.030
 10 windows bringing to mind the most 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:16.880
 the main thing and then of that was of course 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.650
 keylogger you add that if you 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.690
 want to get maximum reliability 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.530
 and you are not so critical design stay 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.289
 on windows 7 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.900
 if you want more or less beautiful 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:27.810
 regarding 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.910
 securely put windows 8 1 by the way on 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.020
 I did it on my tablet because 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.150
 after prolonged use 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.259
 dozens tablet mode turned up for 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.180
 I'm less comfortable 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:37.530
 well and if you want to get beautiful 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.479
 design tangible increase 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.979
 performance and you are not strong 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.350
 disturb what your personal data 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.669
 such as 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.680
 visited webpages by movie with 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.720
 site coordinates user fragments 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.880
 postal correspondence with data perfect 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.000
 calls and the other will lie on 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.699
 servers of one very good company 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.600
 the windows 10 is better operating 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:03.510
 systems and existing Aida some post 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:06.990
 Scriptum on the OS, see 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:10.800
 windows 10 as well as windows 8 and 8 1 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.880
 we had such a graph in the settings 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.090
 as parameters 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:18.030
 what is it according to the design of the texture on i 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:21.530
 control panels in the metro interface then 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:24.120
 there seems to be beautiful 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:26.820
 why should we leave the old panel 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.590
 management that is in fact I can 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.440
 change the same settings them 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.750
 parameters and in the notification panel why 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.180
 it 's just as confusing and either 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.710
 control panel all redesign tee either 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.580
 remove it altogether and leave only 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:44.070
 I do not know the parameters, although in the parameters 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.349
 There are not all the functions of the control panel but 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:50.159
 again why can't you do everything exactly 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:52.710
 and I also want to find fault with rendering 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:55.139
 Font program parameter tell me 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.849
 I see one that all fonts are blurred 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:59.400
 when i turn to any item 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:02.599
 that is, it is really noticeable I turn 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.740
 some point and for a split second I have 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:06.720
 the image is just falling apart 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.180
 the display is the most important thing such a problem 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.409
 not only i have i checked it on 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.750
 tablet 

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:14.750
 the same thing so how how would 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:18.659
 enjoyed the control panel so 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:20.699
 I use it all as usual 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:23.099
 made your drum resonate 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:23.789
 membranes lion triglav good luck to all and 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:26.580
 soon 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:29.090
 Well, there still husky repost well, you yourself 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.090
 know shorter
