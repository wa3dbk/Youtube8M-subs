00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.630 

turn<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.519> lepton<00:02:31.849> section<00:02:32.299> by<00:02:33.019> 90<00:02:33.379> degrees<00:02:33.799> in

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
turn down the cockpit and move the head

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:56.330 
turn down the cockpit and move the head
with<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.410> clock<00:02:49.620> it<00:02:49.860> up<00:02:54.860> connect<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:56.100> legs

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
with the clock it up connect the legs

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.090 
with the clock it up connect the legs
together<00:02:57.890> and<00:02:59.270> so<00:03:00.270> and<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:01.590> same<00:03:01.800> with<00:03:01.980> the

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
together and so and the same with the

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:47.410 
together and so and the same with the
arms<00:03:02.430> I<00:03:08.630> hope<00:03:09.630> this<00:03:09.870> isn't<00:03:10.110> frame

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.479 

as<00:03:48.420> you<00:03:48.599> can<00:03:48.780> see<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.620> gray<00:03:49.799> panel<00:03:50.129> in<00:03:50.370> the

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
as you can see the gray panel in the

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.209 
as you can see the gray panel in the
beginning<00:03:50.939> became<00:03:51.389> a<00:03:51.420> shoulder<00:03:52.139> pad<00:03:52.349> or<00:03:53.159> a

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:53.219 
beginning became a shoulder pad or a

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:56.720 
beginning became a shoulder pad or a
shoulder<00:03:53.609> armor<00:03:55.010> you<00:03:56.010> can<00:03:56.159> still<00:03:56.430> activate

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
shoulder armor you can still activate

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:05.569 
shoulder armor you can still activate
the<00:03:57.030> key<00:03:57.239> chemic<00:04:02.810> the<00:04:03.810> good<00:04:04.019> thing<00:04:04.230> is<00:04:04.579> the

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
the key chemic the good thing is the

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.140 
the key chemic the good thing is the
figure<00:04:05.909> remains<00:04:06.090> its<00:04:06.510> stability<00:04:07.730> it<00:04:08.730> is<00:04:08.790> well

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
figure remains its stability it is well

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.479 
figure remains its stability it is well
balanced

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
balanced

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:15.110 
balanced
although<00:04:11.719> you<00:04:12.719> cannot<00:04:13.109> turn<00:04:13.439> the<00:04:14.280> verb<00:04:14.489> the

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
although you cannot turn the verb the

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:29.890 
although you cannot turn the verb the
weapon<00:04:15.419> by<00:04:15.599> 360<00:04:16.500> degrees<00:04:16.799> anymore

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.920 

you<00:04:30.900> can<00:04:31.080> also<00:04:31.790> change<00:04:32.790> the<00:04:32.940> sides<00:04:33.360> from<00:04:33.780> the

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
you can also change the sides from the

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:40.790 
you can also change the sides from the
shoulder<00:04:34.290> pad<00:04:34.500> and<00:04:34.710> the<00:04:34.800> weapon<00:04:39.380> just<00:04:40.380> unlock

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
shoulder pad and the weapon just unlock

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:56.860 
shoulder pad and the weapon just unlock
the<00:04:42.320> arms<00:04:49.700> move<00:04:50.700> up<00:04:50.910> the<00:04:51.150> head<00:04:51.330> with<00:04:52.110> a<00:04:52.140> cockpit

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.810 

come<00:04:57.870> on<00:05:00.710> yeah<00:05:01.710> of<00:05:02.010> course<00:05:02.370> you<00:05:02.550> have<00:05:02.640> to

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
come on yeah of course you have to

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:09.020 
come on yeah of course you have to
unlock<00:05:03.140> the<00:05:04.140> legs<00:05:04.380> again<00:05:06.800> turn<00:05:07.800> this<00:05:07.980> by<00:05:08.220> 800

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
unlock the legs again turn this by 800

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:29.910 
unlock the legs again turn this by 800
180<00:05:09.720> degrees

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:29.920 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.160 

so<00:05:30.920> you<00:05:30.980> have<00:05:31.310> a<00:05:32.680> little<00:05:33.680> bit<00:05:33.920> options<00:05:34.370> here

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.170 
so you have a little bit options here

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:44.700 
so you have a little bit options here
how<00:05:36.170> to<00:05:36.230> present<00:05:36.530> it<00:05:36.860> in<00:05:36.980> robot<00:05:37.340> mode

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:53.260 

the<00:05:45.710> light-piping<00:05:46.220> is<00:05:46.610> here<00:05:48.160> but<00:05:51.910> it<00:05:52.910> doesn't

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
the light-piping is here but it doesn't

00:05:53.270 --> 00:06:03.190 
the light-piping is here but it doesn't
add<00:05:53.390> much<00:05:53.420> to<00:05:53.660> the<00:05:53.870> figure<00:05:59.200> now<00:06:01.960> because<00:06:02.960> of

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:03.200 
add much to the figure now because of

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.180 
add much to the figure now because of
the<00:06:03.470> two<00:06:04.150> ball<00:06:05.150> joints<00:06:05.630> and<00:06:05.780> every<00:06:06.080> arm<00:06:06.590> and

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
the two ball joints and every arm and

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.440 
the two ball joints and every arm and
leg<00:06:07.660> the<00:06:08.660> figure<00:06:08.960> remains<00:06:09.140> it's<00:06:09.500> possibility

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.450 
leg the figure remains it's possibility

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:18.430 
leg the figure remains it's possibility
it<00:06:11.450> had<00:06:12.130> in<00:06:13.130> the<00:06:13.570> robot<00:06:14.570> mode<00:06:16.990> at<00:06:17.990> the<00:06:18.200> same

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
it had in the robot mode at the same

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.820 
it had in the robot mode at the same
time<00:06:18.770> it<00:06:19.100> is<00:06:19.280> valid<00:06:19.640> balanced<00:06:20.120> and<00:06:20.560> sell<00:06:21.560> scrap

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
time it is valid balanced and sell scrap

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.740 
time it is valid balanced and sell scrap
metal<00:06:22.220> unites<00:06:22.610> stability<00:06:23.390> and<00:06:23.630> possibility

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:25.750 
metal unites stability and possibility

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.280 
metal unites stability and possibility
so<00:06:26.750> I<00:06:26.780> recommend<00:06:27.380> buying<00:06:27.620> this<00:06:27.920> figure
