00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.140
 he has that too 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.500
 34 35 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.820
 Dimitri Lobkov drove in column after January 12 this year 

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:13.659
 and ofcourse also 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.339
 who does not have it for doping 9 7 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:20.339
 lokhoff also usually most wins 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:24.579
 now people are passing by 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:26.970
 that is resolved quickly 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.970
 he can then be in the vicinity of his personal appearance 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.950
 then it was already unknown 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.200
 He still has a critical book on Qatar on a day off 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.920
 she can't wait is not far behind 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.350
 he perseveres with a pyromaniac 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.990
 43 to cover costs 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.130
 34 June 27 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.130
 it's a race 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.480
 like herself 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.030
 complaints about fatigue labor in three years 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.259
 he was a dangerous hobby can mast on c2000 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:09.399
 the child added that first this he has never done for the fire 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:10.490
 to fight 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.490
 personal record 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 olof costs 34 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.140
 I no longer grant their column after months 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.300
 a great starting point for the races 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.660
 and that should therefore bring out the best the spokesperson we have to drive 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.810
 to start with 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:33.600
 the man 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.960
 do you all ever do 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.770
 who tops 34 42 was able in tokyo with one 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.770
 beastly opening of 49 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.570
 for the research 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.990
 kalu uche 6 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.990
 huntelaar must have the opening that must be celebrated 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.020
 celio to a traffic jam for up to four hours 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.070
 and that is less 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.070
 9 42 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.830
 he did have to cross the catalan club alone 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.200
 when driving away 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.649
 open the route of 25 members 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.649
 of course not without your own 

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:19.269
 the Chinese customers 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.589
 March 27, 2009 

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:25.069
 the summer much earlier that moment 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.069
 was recently worked out 500 meters 

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:31.139
 we are witnesses 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:34.999
 3 at home here we are the most spectacular 500 meter men 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.849
 the only thing missing is any trace 44 43 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:42.359
 44 45 bullet grave 34 27 

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:44.199
 4 10 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:46.699
 and then via 66 

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:48.889
 you do that in a new way 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:52.109
 g4s sp or disabled 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:54.969
 but assume you assist him in the second round on what comes one more 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:58.179
 second round and that while they are often even harder 

00:02:58.179 --> 00:03:00.280
 and as such number must then end 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.280
 it's not over yet either 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:07.730
 also as a maintenance contract assistants for the young young young 

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:09.779
 that makes them good 

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:11.899
 further on is 22 

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:14.899
 you see two young people in their twenties who are both better off winning 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:18.919
 she knew winner of the world cup this year 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.519
 recently this type of meter 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.779
 due to the cold weather, black went even faster nine 54th minute 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:35.479
 inside 54 courier 9 58 hours 

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:40.039
 Gerets a very good team 

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:43.259
 9 

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:46.259
 one second 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.979
 that is in accordance with advice 

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:53.219
 is going to aim 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:56.219
 fedex 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.139
 the fourth 44 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:04.139
 Brussels on 11 September 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:10.869
 to the intermediate position 

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:16.369
 43 44 45 47 and 48 according to the remaining four euros for adults and the elderly 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.639
 there is another degree between numbers three and four 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:23.879
 these 34 35 people in the world, therefore, nobody collides 26 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:30.689
 the first turn 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:33.439
 grizzlies 

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:34.340
