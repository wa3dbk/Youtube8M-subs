00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.980
 Become the world you change 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.680
 Book by Dr. Dann Hill 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.080
 Hi, everybody! I am Dr. Dann Hill. 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.200
 I want to invite you to read a very special book I wrote, called: 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.520
 "Become You, Change the World" 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.220
 When I wrote this book, what I wanted to do was 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.300
 I want to give people the tools they will need, 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.600
 In a book, 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.660
 To begin to change all aspects of their lives 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.040
 And these are the changes they have been seeking but have not yet made. 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.900
 What happened to me was 14 years ago, 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.440
 I came to a situation where I wanted to commit suicide, if things didn't change. 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.840
 I will go to every workshop that I can find for men, women and children. 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.460
 However, I still can't have the life change I have been seeking. 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.100
 I really just want to wake up happily every day. 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.780
 No longer emotionally entangled in pain, nor financially struggling. 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.960
 I didn't ask for a lot, but what I did did not bring the same result. 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.980
 I met Access Consciousness 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.020
 Then I have been looking for results and everything else 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.420
 It really started happening, faster than I thought. 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.700
 Fast forward to 14 years later, 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.300
 I am a co-creator of Access Consciousness 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.040
 Help bring different tools to the world, and bring different tools to everyone, 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.360
 Let them be used to really start to change their lives. 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.780
 This is what I put in this book. 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.880
 One of the ideas of this book, 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.240
 I will share a very simple one with you. 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.800
 This is your 98% thought, your feelings and your emotions. 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.500
 It doesn't really belong to you. 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.080
 a very simple tool to release them, 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.920
 In fact, if you use this tool for three consecutive days. 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.220
 At the end of the third day, you have the ability to become 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.260
 A walking, talking meditation. 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.420
 There is no thought in your mind, except your own. 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.840
 No matter how many people around you, 

00:01:33.848 --> 00:01:36.220
 No matter where you are in, no matter where you live. 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.883
 Can you imagine if you use this tool? 

00:01:38.883 --> 00:01:41.840
 Will 98% of the garbage in your mind be emptied? 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.320
 This is just one, 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.320
 One of many tools in this system. 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.220
 It is actually designed to give you the insight you can choose, 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.300
 What do you like to choose, to be your life and your world. 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.700
 This is actually the space from which we choose things. 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.220
 This space creates everything that happens, 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.100
 Create everything that is revealed and create how we feel about our own life. 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.740
 What this book does is give you all kinds of tools. 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.700
 Come to the space to create change and the possibilities to do it. 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.840
 But this is not just a tool, it also motivates you to know that you can make these changes. 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.340
 Because like I said, I donâ€™t know what I can do, 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.980
 I know that I have seen my life change after I started using it. 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.080
 This is based on the healing I have done, 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.540
 Thousands of people have been with the world in the past 14 years. 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.366
 I want to put them all in one book, 

00:02:22.366 --> 00:02:25.520
 So you can really have the peace that is yours. 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.800
 And realize that when you do this, 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.580
 When you really have a sense of relaxation and a sense of peace. 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.840
 The person closest to you will start to notice that 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.520
 Then they will realize that they are actually ok to become them. 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.120
 You see that most of us are judge ourselves all our lives. 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.360
 Everything we choose, and everything we have. 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.000
 Especially the seekers of this world. 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.080
 Those who have been in self-assessment. 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.247
 When you start to be you and have a sense of peace 

00:02:46.247 --> 00:02:48.780
 And a sense of ease and get out of your judgment 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.940
 People closest to you will start to notice and those who crave it, 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.820
 I will start to know that they can also have it. 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.900
 They will affect the people around them, who in turn affect the people around them, 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.700
 Then they further influence the people around them. 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.400
 This is where the part that changes the world comes in. 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.500
 What I want to see is a world in which we all can be our own. 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.640
 We can be everything we are, all our greatness. 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.920
 Embrace everything about us and don't cut any part off. 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.420
 So, treat this as an invitation to you. 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.320
 Invite you to come to a possibility to discover what it is like to be. 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.580
 Never have to make yourself wrong. 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.460
 And see what you can contribute 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.940
 Come to create a greater possibility on this planet. 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.120
 Just by becoming you. 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.920
 If you really become you 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.800
 The change and the possibility this world requires? 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.780
 Thank you for listening, I hope you like this book. 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.320
 I hope to see you someday, bye!
