should eventually start to move however
if<00:02:11.810> you<00:02:12.020> fail<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.290> move<00:02:12.770> you<00:02:13.100> might<00:02:13.280> stall<00:02:13.670> the

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
if you fail to move you might stall the

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.620 
if you fail to move you might stall the
car<00:02:13.850> but<00:02:14.570> don't<00:02:14.780> worry<00:02:14.900> just<00:02:15.170> try<00:02:15.560> again<00:02:16.630> after

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
car but don't worry just try again after

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.270 
car but don't worry just try again after
you<00:02:17.720> start<00:02:17.990> moving<00:02:18.140> you<00:02:18.620> can<00:02:18.770> let<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.070> clutch

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
you start moving you can let the clutch

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.670 
you start moving you can let the clutch
out<00:02:19.460> complete<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:23.540> may<00:02:23.870> take<00:02:24.080> several<00:02:24.290> tries

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
out complete it may take several tries

out complete it may take several tries
for<00:02:24.890> you<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.070> move<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.400> car<00:02:25.580> but<00:02:25.850> you<00:02:25.940> will

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
for you to move the car but you will

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.670 
for you to move the car but you will
soon<00:02:26.240> get<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.540> hang<00:02:26.690> of<00:02:26.780> it<00:02:26.870> once<00:02:27.230> you<00:02:27.350> get<00:02:27.530> up

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
soon get the hang of it once you get up

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.860 
soon get the hang of it once you get up
to<00:02:27.800> about<00:02:27.830> 3,000<00:02:28.760> revolutions<00:02:28.880> per<00:02:29.360> minute<00:02:29.480> or

this<00:02:33.080> push<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.590> clutch<00:02:33.950> pedal<00:02:34.190> in<00:02:34.460> take<00:02:34.970> your

this push the clutch pedal in take your
foot<00:02:35.300> off<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.510> gas<00:02:35.720> and<00:02:36.260> move<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.650> stick<00:02:36.920> into

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
foot off the gas and move the stick into

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.580 
foot off the gas and move the stick into
second<00:02:37.670> gear<00:02:40.780> from<00:02:41.780> this<00:02:41.990> point<00:02:42.260> you<00:02:42.530> can

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
second gear from this point you can

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.220 
second gear from this point you can
reapply<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.250> gas<00:02:43.580> let<00:02:44.390> out<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:44.690> clutch<00:02:44.870> and

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
reapply the gas let out the clutch and

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.410 
reapply the gas let out the clutch and
begin<00:02:45.530> to<00:02:45.680> accelerate<00:02:45.980> this<00:02:46.640> process<00:02:46.700> is<00:02:47.390> the

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
begin to accelerate this process is the

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.590 
begin to accelerate this process is the
same<00:02:47.570> for<00:02:47.960> each<00:02:48.230> gear<00:02:48.790> if<00:02:49.790> you<00:02:50.030> ever<00:02:50.240> fall

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
same for each gear if you ever fall

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.990 
same for each gear if you ever fall
below<00:02:50.930> 1500<00:02:51.800> rpm<00:02:52.310> you<00:02:52.670> should<00:02:52.850> probably

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
below 1500 rpm you should probably

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.840 
below 1500 rpm you should probably
downshift<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:54.560> process<00:02:54.980> is<00:02:55.130> also<00:02:55.459> the<00:02:55.610> same

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
downshift the process is also the same

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.670 
downshift the process is also the same
but<00:02:56.060> just<00:02:56.240> move<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.600> stick<00:02:56.870> into<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.410> next

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
but just move the stick into the next

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.430 
but just move the stick into the next
lowest<00:02:58.100> gear<00:02:58.720> when<00:02:59.720> you<00:02:59.750> are<00:02:59.930> cruising<00:03:00.350> along

and<00:03:00.860> happen<00:03:01.190> to<00:03:01.220> come<00:03:01.490> upon<00:03:01.760> a<00:03:01.790> stop<00:03:02.090> sign<00:03:02.360> it

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
and happen to come upon a stop sign it

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.750 
and happen to come upon a stop sign it
is<00:03:02.959> best<00:03:03.170> to<00:03:03.290> put<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:03.560> car<00:03:03.860> into<00:03:04.010> neutral<00:03:04.160> and

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
is best to put the car into neutral and

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.559 
is best to put the car into neutral and
coast<00:03:05.090> to<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.450> stop<00:03:05.630> sign

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.180 

just<00:03:11.569> remember<00:03:12.019> that<00:03:12.409> when<00:03:12.560> putting<00:03:12.769> it<00:03:12.950> into

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
just remember that when putting it into

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.830 
just remember that when putting it into
neutral<00:03:13.610> you<00:03:13.849> still<00:03:14.090> have<00:03:14.209> to<00:03:14.390> use<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.659> clutch

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
neutral you still have to use the clutch

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.539 
neutral you still have to use the clutch
but<00:03:15.379> when<00:03:15.500> you're<00:03:15.650> braking<00:03:16.069> it's<00:03:16.280> not

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
but when you're braking it's not

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.270 
but when you're braking it's not
necessary<00:03:17.200> if<00:03:18.200> you<00:03:18.379> are<00:03:18.500> stopped<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:19.099> knees

necessary if you are stopped the knees
to<00:03:19.459> use<00:03:19.610> reverse<00:03:19.970> just<00:03:20.390> push<00:03:20.599> in<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:20.870> clutch

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
to use reverse just push in the clutch

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.350 
to use reverse just push in the clutch
put<00:03:21.739> it<00:03:21.830> in<00:03:21.920> reverse<00:03:22.069> and<00:03:22.489> hit<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:22.790> gas<00:03:22.970> it's

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
put it in reverse and hit the gas it's

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:31.539 
put it in reverse and hit the gas it's
