00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello everyone with you brands and today 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.529
 show you how to connect to servers in 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.580
 harris fashion and if you want here 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.639
 play online 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.389
 Well, we call the console if you do not have it then 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.990
 go to settings additionally 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.949
 enable development console click ios 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:27.900
 open the console here we write 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:31.500
 connect and ip this server but if 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.380
 it is necessary to port what there for example what I am not 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.980
 Now I remember what this was like 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:44.309
 that will lay down for the sake of a port ip 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:48.390
 love for example I do not know what kind of worker 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:52.649
 taypit for example more precisely at the camera so 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:56.989
 as an example, of course the real one 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:00.149
 so here and here we continue to connect 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:04.110
 such garbage to pray because the server 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:09.240
 does not exist and all that well will 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:14.250
 flour not we can of course well here it is 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.700
 there was a show how to connect to the server yet 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.710
 I'll show you now how to create your server 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.159
 first we call the console again here 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.110
 write 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:29.540
 ip then ip damn did not think that 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:33.659
 get your bang then ip 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.640
 copied copied pim for example 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.500
 I thought of it myself when I didn't think that 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.490
 for and pin here is a bang like that 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:48.960
 now again 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:52.020
 ip all start a new game then press 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.460
 here here is oh more precisely the wrench here 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.460
 we have our server name 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.430
 everybody wrote maxim players how many 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:08.660
 can supply 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:10.789
 526 there is water here all if here 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.300
 tick must be removed because 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.950
 then the local server is closing too 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.230
 do not close back to the card 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.340
 We remove the card any here and this camera 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.250
 Start multiplayer this one is smeared 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.000
 why are you somehow not quality 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:33.250
 I don't know why it's usually normal 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.550
 I will continue when connecting well here we 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.100
 on server 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:42.490
 that's how we see everything here is a window here 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:46.630
 server name is all we need here 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:49.750
 here are connected for example admin here 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.870
 clean the whole map how will the system 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.130
 This thing is to forbid flying 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.530
 an example of this 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.959
 make him admin and want to 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.420
 the players didn't fly 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:04.480
 turn on the flight turn off the tick we 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.010
 We fly and dad went here only problem 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.950
 the fact that it can not be turned off well 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:14.500
 okay so here it is this is immortality 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:21.760
 so that we could never die prove 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:23.290
 even now it does nâ€™t hurt us at all 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:29.010
 die if we take 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.010
 tick then we all die 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.030
 I showed you how to use it here. 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:44.820
 user as a user command 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:46.800
 here it is from the administrator in general 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.840
