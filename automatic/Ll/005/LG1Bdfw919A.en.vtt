00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.209 
looks like I think I got the smallest
jar<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.120> theirs<00:00:39.390> I'm<00:00:39.690> not<00:00:39.870> sure<00:00:40.170> this<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:41.070> what

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
jar of theirs I'm not sure this is what

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.540 
jar of theirs I'm not sure this is what
the<00:00:41.370> color<00:00:41.579> looks<00:00:41.670> like<00:00:42.739> and<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.980> will<00:00:44.040> swatch

it on my hand for you guys now the

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.000 
it on my hand for you guys now the
problem<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.180> their<00:00:48.480> website<00:00:48.980> does<00:00:49.980> not<00:00:50.250> have

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
problem is their website does not have

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.490 
problem is their website does not have
good<00:00:53.010> swatches<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.239> it's<00:00:54.420> really<00:00:55.110> hard<00:00:55.350> to

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
good swatches so it's really hard to

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.849 
good swatches so it's really hard to
choose<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.949> color<00:00:56.899> you<00:00:57.899> just<00:00:58.199> have<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.469> go<00:00:58.620> by

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
the description and it can be really

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.420 
the description and it can be really
hard<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.910> color<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.619> light<00:01:04.619> for<00:01:05.040> me<00:01:05.220> I

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
any other form I just think it's easier

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.809 
any other form I just think it's easier
to<00:03:39.780> work<00:03:39.989> with<00:03:40.049> and<00:03:40.620> my<00:03:41.519> skin<00:03:41.879> is<00:03:43.519> gets<00:03:44.519> a<00:03:44.640> bit

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
to work with and my skin is gets a bit

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.690 
to work with and my skin is gets a bit
oily<00:03:45.030> on<00:03:45.540> my<00:03:45.810> t-zone<00:03:46.049> when<00:03:46.650> it's<00:03:46.860> summertime

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
oily on my t-zone when it's summertime

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.479 
oily on my t-zone when it's summertime
and<00:03:47.940> stuff<00:03:48.330> so<00:03:48.690> I<00:03:49.019> just<00:03:49.650> find<00:03:49.860> that<00:03:50.099> mineral

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
and stuff so I just find that mineral

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.190 
and stuff so I just find that mineral
foundation<00:03:50.760> kind<00:03:51.150> of<00:03:51.269> helps<00:03:51.540> absorb<00:03:51.720> a<00:03:52.170> bit

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
foundation kind of helps absorb a bit

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.070 
foundation kind of helps absorb a bit
the<00:03:52.560> oiliness<00:03:53.189> of<00:03:53.580> my<00:03:53.730> skin<00:03:54.030> and<00:03:54.360> I<00:03:54.750> really

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
the oiliness of my skin and I really

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.320 
the oiliness of my skin and I really
like<00:03:55.290> it<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.860> coverage<00:03:56.370> is<00:03:56.549> also<00:03:56.670> buildable

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
like it the coverage is also buildable

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.679 
like it the coverage is also buildable
you<00:03:57.890> can<00:03:58.890> get<00:03:59.129> a<00:03:59.750> light<00:04:00.750> to<00:04:01.680> medium<00:04:02.010> coverage

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:02.689 
you can get a light to medium coverage

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:05.119 
you can get a light to medium coverage
although<00:04:03.689> if<00:04:03.900> you<00:04:04.019> put<00:04:04.260> too<00:04:04.379> much<00:04:04.500> on<00:04:04.739> it<00:04:04.950> will

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129 
although if you put too much on it will

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:06.920 
although if you put too much on it will
look<00:04:05.370> a<00:04:05.489> bit<00:04:05.519> cakey<00:04:05.939> and<00:04:06.209> artificial<00:04:06.810> and

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
look a bit cakey and artificial and

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.429 
look a bit cakey and artificial and
that's<00:04:07.319> not<00:04:07.560> what<00:04:07.709> I<00:04:07.739> like<00:04:08.120> but<00:04:09.120> I<00:04:09.810> think<00:04:10.170> it<00:04:10.290> is

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:10.439 
that's not what I like but I think it is

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:14.570 
that's not what I like but I think it is
a<00:04:10.970> very<00:04:11.970> good<00:04:12.269> mineral<00:04:12.870> foundation<00:04:13.590> I<00:04:14.099> enjoy
