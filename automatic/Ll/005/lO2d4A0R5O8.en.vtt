direct see you to means that that is

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.789 
direct see you to means that that is
their<00:00:12.389> custom<00:00:12.780> coin<00:00:13.019> solution<00:00:13.559> that<00:00:13.710> they're

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
their custom coin solution that they're

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.620 
their custom coin solution that they're
going<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.009> be<00:00:14.070> using<00:00:14.490> on<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.940> video<00:00:15.210> card<00:00:15.420> and

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
going to be using on the video card and

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.800 
going to be using on the video card and
the<00:00:15.990> OC<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.619> course<00:00:17.070> means<00:00:17.369> overclock<00:00:18.060> so<00:00:18.630> this

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
the OC of course means overclock so this

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.359 
the OC of course means overclock so this
is<00:00:18.960> going<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.199> be<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.320> little<00:00:19.529> bit<00:00:19.710> faster<00:00:20.189> than

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
is going to be a little bit faster than

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.320 
is going to be a little bit faster than
the<00:00:20.430> stock<00:00:20.880> speed<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.960> normal<00:00:22.410> gtx<00:00:23.189> 660<00:00:23.850> the

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
the stock speed of a normal gtx 660 the

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.460 
the stock speed of a normal gtx 660 the
core<00:00:24.630> clock<00:00:24.869> on<00:00:25.109> this<00:00:25.380> card<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:25.920> running<00:00:26.609> at

core clock on this card is running at
1020<00:00:28.470> megahertz<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.279> let's<00:00:29.429> just<00:00:29.550> go<00:00:29.640> ahead

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
1020 megahertz so let's just go ahead

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:40.700 
1020 megahertz so let's just go ahead
and<00:00:29.970> open<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.240> up<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.570> see<00:00:30.900> what<00:00:30.990> we<00:00:31.080> have

just like all newer Asus cards it uses
the<00:02:16.750> same<00:02:16.989> you<00:02:17.470> know<00:02:17.500> coloring<00:02:18.129> and<00:02:18.340> same

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
the same you know coloring and same

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.089 
the same you know coloring and same
color<00:02:19.300> so<00:02:19.569> even<00:02:19.930> though<00:02:20.050> it<00:02:20.319> is<00:02:20.500> an<00:02:20.709> Nvidia

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
color so even though it is an Nvidia

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.150 
color so even though it is an Nvidia
card<00:02:21.430> it<00:02:21.790> does<00:02:22.209> have<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.720> red<00:02:23.010> accents<00:02:24.010> here

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
card it does have the red accents here

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.460 
card it does have the red accents here
on<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.640> shroud<00:02:24.910> you<00:02:25.450> have<00:02:25.569> two<00:02:25.810> large<00:02:26.020> cooling

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
on the shroud you have two large cooling

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.180 
on the shroud you have two large cooling
fans<00:02:26.739> which<00:02:27.489> if<00:02:27.760> we<00:02:28.120> flip<00:02:28.390> it<00:02:28.510> over<00:02:28.629> this<00:02:28.870> way

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
fans which if we flip it over this way

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.250 
fans which if we flip it over this way
you<00:02:30.190> can<00:02:30.370> see<00:02:30.640> three<00:02:31.360> large<00:02:31.569> heat<00:02:31.810> pipes<00:02:32.050> here

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
you can see three large heat pipes here

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.059 
you can see three large heat pipes here
with<00:02:32.440> a<00:02:32.470> direct<00:02:32.950> see<00:02:33.160> two<00:02:33.580> cooler<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:35.069> they

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
with a direct see two cooler and they

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.250 
with a direct see two cooler and they
make<00:02:36.280> direct<00:02:36.610> contact<00:02:36.790> with<00:02:37.209> the<00:02:37.450> GPU<00:02:37.900> so<00:02:38.140> it's

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
make direct contact with the GPU so it's

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.430 
make direct contact with the GPU so it's
very<00:02:38.890> very<00:02:39.250> cool<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:39.910> it's<00:02:40.330> cools<00:02:40.959> much<00:02:41.230> much

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
very very cool and it's cools much much

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.110 
very very cool and it's cools much much
better<00:02:41.620> all<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.069> directs<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.489> you<00:02:42.610> cards<00:02:42.970> that

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
better all the directs to you cards that

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.170 
better all the directs to you cards that
I<00:02:43.330> have<00:02:43.360> used<00:02:43.959> have<00:02:44.650> cooled<00:02:45.069> much<00:02:45.400> better<00:02:45.700> than

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
I have used have cooled much better than

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.900 
I have used have cooled much better than
you<00:02:46.629> know<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:46.870> standard<00:02:47.320> cards<00:02:47.740> you<00:02:48.610> can<00:02:48.730> see

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
the actual heat to be dissipated so it

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.930 
the actual heat to be dissipated so it
is<00:03:53.959> gonna<00:03:54.080> be<00:03:54.170> a<00:03:54.319> good<00:03:54.560> card<00:03:55.280> we<00:03:55.459> can't<00:03:55.670> wait<00:03:55.790> to
