Hey folks it is Barry here from my virgin
kitchen today I am showing you how to make

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.950
some chocolate Guinness shooters.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.099
Chocolate and Guinness cream base, with a
cr�me fraiche, sugar and vanilla topping

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.130
and it even looks like it has been freshly
poured!

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:22.930
It is a very special random shoutout today
so while I gobble this up, check this out.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:29.630

of Howth, welcome to Ireland.

patricks day collaboration and I have no doubt

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.560

Over on my channel I am going to be making

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.980

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:52.230
So head over to my channel subscribe and check
out the full st patricks day playlist, see

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.230
you soon.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.680
Thanks Donal go check out his stew after this
video these are so so good, I just want to

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.680
keep eating it.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.710
I will not but if you want to have a go, hit
pause on the video now, write all of these

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.060
ingredients down or they are in the description
box below, lets do it.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:17.610
First up put your saucepan on the hob and
add the cream and the Guinness, slowly warm

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.350
that up under a low flame stirring as you
go.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.090
To the side in a large mixing bowl have the
eggs, chocolate chips and salt ready for the

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.090
cream mixture.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.330
When your Guinness mixture starts to simmer
consistently and for some reason that looked

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.110
awesome, immediately pour that mixture into
your large bowl.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:41.980
The heat of the cream will cook the eggs,
keep whisking until all combined and smooth.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.320
Leave it to one side.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.070
In a separate bowl combine together the cr�me
fraiche, icing sugar and vanilla extract.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.580
Mix through until nice and combined and softened,
by that time your chocolate should have cooled

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.580
slightly.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.759
Transfer it to a jug to make pouring it into
the shot glasses easier.

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.890
Get it nearly all the way to the top, now
here is the bad news you want to put it in

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.200
the fridge for at least 2 hours to firm up
the Guinness mixture at the bottom otherwise

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.890
the cr�me fraiche will fall through it.

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.600
You could cheat like I may have done by putting
it in the freezer for at least half an hour

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.900
or you can sunbathe like boston did.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.550
With your Guinness base ready and the cr�me
fraiche nice and firmed spoon it on top and

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.000
it will look absolutely amazing, as I say
a bit like it has been poured into a pint

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
glass.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.940
You could try and do the clover if you want,
but just make it look funky.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.810
You can either chill them again or eat straight
away!

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.190
They taste phenomenal I really hope you give
