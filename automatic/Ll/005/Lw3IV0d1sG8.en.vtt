00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
is very very tall which is kind of a

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.409 
is very very tall which is kind of a
weird<00:00:30.529> thing<00:00:30.740> to<00:00:30.800> say<00:00:30.919> but<00:00:31.730> if<00:00:31.849> you<00:00:31.939> if<00:00:32.239> you

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
weird thing to say but if you if you

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.210 
weird thing to say but if you if you
look<00:00:32.450> at<00:00:32.780> it<00:00:32.900> the<00:00:33.050> buildings<00:00:33.440> are<00:00:33.560> stacked<00:00:33.980> up

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
look at it the buildings are stacked up

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.130 
look at it the buildings are stacked up
on<00:00:34.370> top<00:00:34.430> of<00:00:34.730> each<00:00:34.940> other<00:00:35.150> and<00:00:35.480> you<00:00:35.510> kind<00:00:35.840> of<00:00:35.900> can

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
on top of each other and you kind of can

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.170 
on top of each other and you kind of can
move<00:00:36.410> up<00:00:36.650> the<00:00:36.950> building<00:00:37.160> so<00:00:37.430> the<00:00:37.520> map<00:00:37.700> is<00:00:37.880> very

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
move up the building so the map is very

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.720 
move up the building so the map is very
strange<00:00:38.630> it's<00:00:38.870> not<00:00:38.989> just<00:00:39.200> a<00:00:39.730> horizontal

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
strange it's not just a horizontal

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.180 
strange it's not just a horizontal
horizontally<00:00:41.600> laid<00:00:41.810> out<00:00:41.989> map<00:00:42.290> it<00:00:42.500> kind<00:00:42.680> of<00:00:42.710> is

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
horizontally laid out map it kind of is

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.279 
horizontally laid out map it kind of is
horizontally<00:00:44.030> laid<00:00:44.239> out<00:00:44.390> and<00:00:44.809> vertically

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
horizontally laid out and vertically

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:46.959 
horizontally laid out and vertically
laid<00:00:45.469> out<00:00:45.590> you<00:00:45.680> can<00:00:45.800> go<00:00:45.949> both<00:00:46.309> ways<00:00:46.699> and

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
laid out you can go both ways and

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.060 
laid out you can go both ways and
there's<00:00:47.269> different<00:00:47.660> planes<00:00:48.019> as<00:00:48.710> you<00:00:48.920> get

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
there's different planes as you get

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.970 
there's different planes as you get
higher<00:00:49.250> and<00:00:49.309> higher<00:00:49.579> on<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:50.750> on<00:00:51.379> the<00:00:51.440> complex

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
higher and higher on the on the complex

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.220 
higher and higher on the on the complex
which<00:00:52.250> is<00:00:52.370> very<00:00:52.760> interesting<00:00:53.449> I<00:00:53.629> believe<00:00:54.109> this

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
which is very interesting I believe this

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.380 
which is very interesting I believe this
maps<00:00:54.440> also<00:00:54.739> based<00:00:55.250> in<00:00:55.399> Australia<00:00:56.059> i<00:00:56.120> want<00:00:56.329> to

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
maps also based in Australia i want to

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.209 
maps also based in Australia i want to
say<00:00:56.570> by<00:00:57.109> a<00:00:57.140> few<00:00:57.320> landmarks<00:00:57.620> so<00:00:57.859> you<00:00:57.920> can<00:00:58.039> see

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
say by a few landmarks so you can see

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.549 
say by a few landmarks so you can see
outside<00:00:58.370> the<00:00:58.760> map<00:00:58.940> but<00:00:59.329> yeah<00:00:59.420> very<00:00:59.809> very<00:01:00.260> cool

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
outside the map but yeah very very cool

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:01.990 
outside the map but yeah very very cool
map<00:01:00.829> I<00:01:01.010> have<00:01:01.190> to<00:01:01.339> say<00:01:01.489> this<00:01:01.579> is<00:01:01.730> one<00:01:01.850> of<00:01:01.940> my

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
map I have to say this is one of my

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.520 
map I have to say this is one of my
favorite<00:01:02.390> maps<00:01:02.570> honestly<00:01:03.050> I've<00:01:03.170> had<00:01:03.289> a<00:01:03.320> lot<00:01:03.469> of

favorite maps honestly I've had a lot of

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.020 
favorite maps honestly I've had a lot of
fun<00:01:03.679> playing<00:01:04.010> on<00:01:04.190> it<00:01:04.370> you<00:01:04.519> can<00:01:04.640> go<00:01:04.760> to<00:01:04.820> just

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
fun playing on it you can go to just

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.430 
fun playing on it you can go to just
destroy<00:01:05.510> people<00:01:05.870> when<00:01:06.020> you're<00:01:06.110> in<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.260> power

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
destroy people when you're in the power

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.890 
destroy people when you're in the power
positions<00:01:07.040> up<00:01:07.250> high<00:01:07.610> so<00:01:08.300> when<00:01:08.480> playing<00:01:08.750> this

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
positions up high so when playing this

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.380 
positions up high so when playing this
map<00:01:09.110> I<00:01:09.260> would<00:01:09.380> highly<00:01:09.860> recommend<00:01:10.390> taking

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
map I would highly recommend taking

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.180 
map I would highly recommend taking
advantage<00:01:11.960> of<00:01:12.050> the<00:01:12.140> higher<00:01:12.440> parts<00:01:12.830> because<00:01:13.010> if

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
advantage of the higher parts because if

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.710 
advantage of the higher parts because if
you're<00:01:13.610> really<00:01:13.730> sticking<00:01:14.030> to<00:01:14.240> the<00:01:14.360> lower

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
you're really sticking to the lower

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.690 
you're really sticking to the lower
level<00:01:15.200> and<00:01:15.350> running<00:01:15.680> around<00:01:15.800> the<00:01:16.160> base<00:01:16.370> of<00:01:16.400> the

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
level and running around the base of the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.850 
level and running around the base of the
map<00:01:16.880> um<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:17.450> guys<00:01:17.660> up<00:01:17.960> on<00:01:18.200> top<00:01:18.470> they're<00:01:18.770> gonna

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
map um the guys up on top they're gonna

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.680 
map um the guys up on top they're gonna
look<00:01:19.040> down<00:01:19.280> if<00:01:19.430> you<00:01:19.580> like<00:01:19.640> like<00:01:20.000> from<00:01:20.630> a

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
look down if you like like from a

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.030 
look down if you like like from a
bird's-eye<00:01:21.110> point<00:01:21.440> of<00:01:21.530> view<00:01:21.650> and<00:01:21.740> just<00:01:21.920> there

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
bird's-eye point of view and just there

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.410 
bird's-eye point of view and just there
to<00:01:22.070> be<00:01:22.220> able<00:01:22.280> to<00:01:22.460> destroy<00:01:22.820> you<00:01:22.880> pick<00:01:23.150> you<00:01:23.270> off

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
to be able to destroy you pick you off

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.640 
to be able to destroy you pick you off
like<00:01:23.630> you're<00:01:23.750> nothing<00:01:23.870> I'm<00:01:24.230> so<00:01:24.470> I<00:01:24.530> would

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
like you're nothing I'm so I would

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.620 
like you're nothing I'm so I would
highly<00:01:25.040> recommend<00:01:25.070> kind<00:01:25.970> of<00:01:26.090> staying<00:01:26.390> a

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
highly recommend kind of staying a

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.480 
highly recommend kind of staying a
little<00:01:26.990> higher<00:01:27.410> not<00:01:27.740> completely<00:01:28.160> at<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:28.310> top

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
little higher not completely at the top

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.680 
little higher not completely at the top
maybe<00:01:28.670> because<00:01:28.940> it<00:01:29.090> does<00:01:29.210> get<00:01:29.360> a<00:01:29.420> little<00:01:29.510> more

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
maybe because it does get a little more

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.690 
maybe because it does get a little more
open<00:01:30.080> up<00:01:30.200> there<00:01:30.380> um<00:01:30.590> but<00:01:31.100> I<00:01:31.160> would<00:01:31.400> recommend

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
open up there um but I would recommend

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.520 
open up there um but I would recommend
staying<00:01:32.210> at<00:01:32.330> least<00:01:32.510> in<00:01:32.720> the<00:01:32.810> middle<00:01:33.200> level

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
staying at least in the middle level

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.830 
staying at least in the middle level
kind<00:01:33.800> of<00:01:33.920> on<00:01:34.580> the<00:01:34.670> second<00:01:35.030> level<00:01:35.120> ish<00:01:35.360> kind<00:01:35.720> of

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
kind of on the second level ish kind of

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.480 
kind of on the second level ish kind of
area<00:01:36.110> that's<00:01:36.470> probably<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:36.770> best<00:01:36.950> place<00:01:37.190> to

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
area that's probably the best place to
