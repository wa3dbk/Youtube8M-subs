you're on a sheet of ice you're in a

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.850 
you're on a sheet of ice you're in a
canyon<00:01:53.460> in<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.850> middle<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.210> nowhere<00:01:54.500> where<00:01:55.500> if

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
canyon in the middle of nowhere where if

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.370 
canyon in the middle of nowhere where if
you<00:01:56.040> can't<00:01:56.340> get<00:01:56.640> down<00:01:56.909> with<00:01:57.360> your<00:01:57.689> vehicle<00:01:57.869> I

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
you can't get down with your vehicle I

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.469 
you can't get down with your vehicle I
mean<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:58.950> could<00:01:59.100> very<00:01:59.310> well<00:01:59.369> get<00:01:59.670> hypothermia

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
mean you could very well get hypothermia

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.240

and<00:02:00.540> freeze<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.840> death<00:02:01.049> so<00:02:01.469> your<00:02:01.619> car<00:02:01.829> becomes
