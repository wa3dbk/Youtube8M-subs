00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
this summer though so I can expect us to

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.160 
this summer though so I can expect us to
see<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.189> on<00:02:02.369> our<00:02:02.520> 3ds<00:02:02.939> eshop<00:02:03.540> but<00:02:03.869> sort<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.049> at

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
see it on our 3ds eshop but sort of at

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.920 
see it on our 3ds eshop but sort of at
the<00:02:04.259> end<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.649> year<00:02:04.680> Kyle<00:02:05.219> time<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:06.000> my

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
the end of the year Kyle time is my

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.690 
the end of the year Kyle time is my
prediction<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.829> course<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.250> may<00:02:08.369> not<00:02:08.489> come<00:02:08.550> out

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
prediction of course it may not come out

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.430 
prediction of course it may not come out
in<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.879> West<00:02:09.060> at<00:02:09.239> all<00:02:09.420> but<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.840> think<00:02:10.080> he's

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
in the West at all but I think he's

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.300 
in the West at all but I think he's
smart<00:02:10.590> enough<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.979> know<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:11.190> found

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
smart enough to know that found

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.220 
smart enough to know that found
