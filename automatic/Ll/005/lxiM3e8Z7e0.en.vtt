from<00:02:23.850> whatever<00:02:24.330> was<00:02:24.810> going<00:02:25.050> on<00:02:25.260> for<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.590> in

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
from whatever was going on for you in

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.900 
from whatever was going on for you in
April<00:02:26.190> with<00:02:26.760> different<00:02:27.090> relationships<00:02:27.780> and

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
April with different relationships and

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.390 
April with different relationships and
mercury<00:02:29.910> has<00:02:30.180> just<00:02:30.600> passed<00:02:30.870> this<00:02:31.400> opposition

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
mercury has just passed this opposition

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.860 
mercury has just passed this opposition
with<00:02:32.850> Saturn<00:02:33.330> deep<00:02:33.720> thinking<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:34.980> is<00:02:35.870> coming

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
with Saturn deep thinking it is coming

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.310 
with Saturn deep thinking it is coming
up<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.650> square<00:02:38.220> neptune<00:02:38.900> confused<00:02:39.900> thinking

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
up to square neptune confused thinking

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.350 
up to square neptune confused thinking
and<00:02:41.030> it<00:02:42.030> is<00:02:42.390> connected<00:02:43.110> with<00:02:44.209> uranus<00:02:45.209> and

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
and it is connected with uranus and

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.080 
and it is connected with uranus and
pluto<00:02:45.770> by<00:02:46.770> a<00:02:47.090> semi<00:02:48.090> square<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:50.130> another

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
pluto by a semi square and and another

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.260 
pluto by a semi square and and another
aspect<00:02:51.810> that<00:02:52.140> represents<00:02:53.010> being<00:02:53.700> able<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.120> go

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
aspect that represents being able to go

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.949 
aspect that represents being able to go
deep<00:02:54.600> so<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.830> thinking<00:02:56.220> process<00:02:56.640> of<00:02:57.330> this

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
deep so the thinking process of this

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.090 
deep so the thinking process of this
full<00:02:58.260> moon<00:02:58.760> can<00:03:00.050> really<00:03:01.050> be<00:03:01.230> activated<00:03:01.920> from

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
full moon can really be activated from

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.979 
full moon can really be activated from
all<00:03:02.370> like<00:03:02.730> being<00:03:03.030> torn<00:03:03.360> in<00:03:03.480> all<00:03:03.720> different

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
all like being torn in all different

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.380 
all like being torn in all different
directions<00:03:04.170> I<00:03:04.860> want<00:03:05.070> to<00:03:05.160> think<00:03:05.400> different<00:03:06.300> I

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
directions I want to think different I

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.830 
directions I want to think different I
got<00:03:06.540> this<00:03:06.630> idea<00:03:06.840> but<00:03:07.410> I'm<00:03:07.500> not<00:03:07.650> so<00:03:07.800> sure<00:03:07.830> and<00:03:08.840> is

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
got this idea but I'm not so sure and is

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.750 
got this idea but I'm not so sure and is
it<00:03:09.900> really<00:03:10.110> practical<00:03:11.090> but<00:03:12.090> still<00:03:13.430> take<00:03:14.430> a

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
it really practical but still take a

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.440 
it really practical but still take a
moment<00:03:15.090> during<00:03:15.600> the<00:03:15.810> full<00:03:15.989> moon<00:03:16.230> to<00:03:17.450> center

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
moment during the full moon to center

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.190 
moment during the full moon to center
yourself<00:03:18.530> to<00:03:19.530> relax<00:03:19.910> to<00:03:20.910> get<00:03:21.060> in<00:03:21.180> touch<00:03:21.450> with
