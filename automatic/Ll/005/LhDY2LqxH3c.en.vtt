let's<00:00:38.280> talk<00:00:38.460> about<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.850> what<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.420> means<00:00:39.600> for

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
let's talk about that what it means for

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.139 
let's talk about that what it means for
us<00:00:39.870> here<00:00:40.140> on<00:00:40.290> earth<00:00:40.700> joining<00:00:41.700> us<00:00:41.820> once<00:00:41.969> again

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
discover magazine so when it flips on

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.340 
discover magazine so when it flips on
the<00:00:47.340> Sun<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.760> flips<00:00:48.090> throughout<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.870> magnetic

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
the Sun it flips throughout the magnetic

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.840 
the Sun it flips throughout the magnetic
field<00:00:49.590> throughout<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.070> entire<00:00:50.430> solar<00:00:50.730> system

field throughout the entire solar system

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.360 
field throughout the entire solar system
but<00:00:51.300> what<00:00:51.510> does<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.660> mean<00:00:51.780> for<00:00:51.989> earth<00:00:52.500> what<00:00:53.309> do

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
but what does it mean for earth what do

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.630 
but what does it mean for earth what do
we<00:00:53.489> see<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.940> feel<00:00:54.180> here<00:00:54.690> right<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.070> Sun<00:00:56.610> is

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
we see and feel here right so the Sun is

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.160 
we see and feel here right so the Sun is
active<00:00:57.239> all<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.390> time<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.750> Sun<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:58.020> like<00:00:58.140> a

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
active all the time the Sun is like a

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.619 
active all the time the Sun is like a
magnetic<00:00:58.710> bottle<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.399> when<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.609> Sun<00:00:59.789> flips

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
magnetic bottle so when the Sun flips

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.450 
magnetic bottle so when the Sun flips
that<00:01:01.079> actually<00:01:01.350> means<00:01:01.500> all<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.859> mega<00:01:02.100> mega

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
that actually means all that mega mega

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.929 
that actually means all that mega mega
activity<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.329> flipping<00:01:03.809> with<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:04.530> the

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
activity is flipping with it so the

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:06.770 
activity is flipping with it so the
there's<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.030> there's<00:01:06.270> an<00:01:06.330> electrical<00:01:06.659> current

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
there's a there's an electrical current

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.850 
there's a there's an electrical current
that<00:01:06.990> runs<00:01:07.049> through<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.409> whole<00:01:07.560> solar<00:01:07.680> system

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
that runs through the whole solar system

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.399 
that runs through the whole solar system
including<00:01:08.250> past<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.210> planet<00:01:09.570> all<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.229> stuff

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
including past the planet all that stuff

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.590 
including past the planet all that stuff
flips<00:01:10.650> upside<00:01:10.830> down<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.790> only<00:01:12.000> happens<00:01:12.450> at<00:01:12.510> a

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
flips upside down this only happens at a

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.359 
flips upside down this only happens at a
time<00:01:12.810> when<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.080> Sun<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.500> particularly<00:01:14.100> act

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
time when the Sun is particularly act

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.850 
time when the Sun is particularly act
which<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.729> now<00:01:14.939> which<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.509> right<00:01:15.720> now<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.680> so

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
which is now which is right now that so

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.260 
which is now which is right now that so
this<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.280> kind<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:17.850> kind<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.060> flip

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
this this kind of this kind of flip

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.179 
this this kind of this kind of flip
happens<00:01:18.600> every<00:01:18.869> 22<00:01:19.290> years<00:01:19.619> are<00:01:19.830> we<00:01:19.920> going<00:01:20.100> to

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
happens every 22 years are we going to

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.160 
happens every 22 years are we going to
see<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.670> know<00:01:20.790> some<00:01:21.030> climate<00:01:21.509> change<00:01:21.810> here

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
see you know some climate change here

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.800 
see you know some climate change here
more<00:01:22.439> clouds<00:01:22.880> Aurora's<00:01:23.880> what<00:01:24.150> about<00:01:24.330> Aurora's

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
more clouds Aurora's what about Aurora's

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.359 
more clouds Aurora's what about Aurora's
right<00:01:25.320> so<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.770> time<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:25.979> high<00:01:26.159> solar

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
right so this is a time of high solar

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.460 
right so this is a time of high solar
activity<00:01:26.460> when<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.180> see<00:01:27.330> exactly<00:01:28.229> those

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
activity when you see exactly those

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.260 
activity when you see exactly those
kinds<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.740> things<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:28.950> see<00:01:29.130> Aurora's<00:01:29.579> there's

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
kinds of things you see Aurora's there's

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.260 
kinds of things you see Aurora's there's
a<00:01:30.360> greater<00:01:30.570> risk<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:31.049> blackouts<00:01:31.799> this<00:01:32.790> there's

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
a greater risk of blackouts this there's

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.569 
a greater risk of blackouts this there's
just<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.479> constant<00:01:33.810> low-level<00:01:34.400> damage<00:01:35.400> that

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
just a constant low-level damage that

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.819 
just a constant low-level damage that
happens<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.060> our<00:01:36.090> counts<00:01:36.780> blackout<00:01:37.320> stealing

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
happens to our counts blackout stealing

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.969 
happens to our counts blackout stealing
power<00:01:38.040> satellites<00:01:38.960> this<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.140> time<00:01:40.439> when

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
power satellites this is a time when

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.999 
power satellites this is a time when
major<00:01:41.460> activity<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.290> more<00:01:43.290> likely<00:01:43.500> than<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.890> is

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
major activity is more likely than it is

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.819 
major activity is more likely than it is
at<00:01:44.130> other<00:01:44.250> times<00:01:44.520> right<00:01:44.880> now<00:01:45.020> severe<00:01:46.020> solar

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
at other times right now severe solar

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.600 
at other times right now severe solar
super<00:01:47.790> storms<00:01:48.360> which<00:01:48.750> are<00:01:48.960> different<00:01:49.649> what

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
super storms which are different what

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.510 
super storms which are different what
could<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:50.820> do<00:01:51.270> right<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.799> Sun<00:01:53.490> is

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
could that do right so the Sun is

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.480 
could that do right so the Sun is
continuously<00:01:55.009> disrupting<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.130> space<00:01:56.340> around

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
continuously disrupting the space around

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.100 
continuously disrupting the space around
the<00:01:56.700> earth<00:01:56.820> its<00:01:57.060> way<00:01:57.210> what<00:01:57.630> they<00:01:57.689> call<00:01:57.869> space

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
the earth its way what they call space

to blackouts not just black outs but you
