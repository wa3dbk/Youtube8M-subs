 then and then here in minecraft 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:04.260
 then you open the opponent 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.320
 you can see that here and now 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.130
 we open ourselves first 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.260
 we delete 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.869
 with 1 yes and then we open one 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:21.390
 immediately the team to the side 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:23.689

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.850
 pull three over 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:30.920

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:36.600
 Sound Kollegs right here 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.409
 these three files are about this 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.810
 back 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:47.850
 just the right back now all 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:51.060
 these files mark from the ok 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:58.229
 Now you have to run next 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:02:00.000
 you also have to move with Cuba otherwise 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.570
 get the black screen that is now 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.590
 not so nice these files over 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:11.520
 even with the four leave 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:14.640
 ok now we have flowed here and now 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.500
 your markus ott we conclude that that 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.500
 we can open force behind gm 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.079
 OK 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.709
 Now you have noticed her better 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.060
 said that he has a different menu 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.519
 now we can also meet 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.480
 close now go back to percent 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:44.909

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.190

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:58.290
 she will conclude about this now and 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:03:01.200
 then missed again minecraft eat 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:05.400
 Do you see the country again does not have it 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.739
 it takes more time to load it now 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:14.040
 a little bit longer because he has to 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:16.290
 his mother and now we notice how 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.829
 For example, we see democracy 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.560
 motto now we must also be able to silke 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:27.739

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:41.359
 For example, the tests with creative 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:41.359
 superflat still a bit model 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:53.530
 Now, for example , we have that now 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:56.890
 clubs made here then we are allowed to 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:01.750
 example knows that from afar are 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:07.210
 the monetary sounds again are yes 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:09.010
 For example, now a hit is out of the box 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.700
 So we also fight for example 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:16.900
 very close and you still have new ones 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.910

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:40.930
 horst night is burning because I otherwise 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.970
 always attack at skeletons and at night 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.640
 other animals know the horses there are 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.500
 also a pegasus that can also others 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:52.990
 On the left, the created green range 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:56.310
 Number skeletons can be the rider of 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.940
 the air has fallen on you 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.470
 the green one 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.950
 the rest slams source that is now 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.190

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:10.230
 Do you have to take care of slime now 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.230

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.870
 the index finger squared one luck the 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.120
 right click so with the saddle that it 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.580
 in the saddle after that gives him a 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:25.930
 apple and then you can get a certain 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:28.060
 the now even the animals now has 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:32.320
 this one now you can ride the horse and 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:35.289
 then it could also run as far as it is 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:42.099
 the piglets of the snake 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:45.539
 and then also carries very little horses 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:45.539
