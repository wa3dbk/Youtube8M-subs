using<00:03:29.780> a<00:03:29.900> large<00:03:30.170> knife<00:03:30.500> you're<00:03:30.709> just<00:03:30.920> going<00:03:31.070> to

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
using a large knife you're just going to

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.550 
using a large knife you're just going to
cut<00:03:31.340> it<00:03:31.459> into<00:03:31.700> squares<00:03:32.270> make<00:03:33.200> them<00:03:33.350> fairly

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
cut it into squares make them fairly

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.440 
cut it into squares make them fairly
small<00:03:33.980> an<00:03:34.370> inch<00:03:34.580> by<00:03:34.850> an<00:03:34.910> inch<00:03:35.030> let's<00:03:35.330> say

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
small an inch by an inch let's say

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.270 
small an inch by an inch let's say
because<00:03:35.900> it's<00:03:36.410> very<00:03:36.709> very<00:03:36.980> sweet

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
because it's very very sweet

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.420 
because it's very very sweet
it<00:03:37.640> is<00:03:37.790> fudge<00:03:38.060> after<00:03:38.390> all<00:03:38.739> now<00:03:39.739> I<00:03:39.769> suggest<00:03:40.160> that

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
it is fudge after all now I suggest that

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.540 
it is fudge after all now I suggest that
in<00:03:40.610> between<00:03:40.790> cuts<00:03:41.720> you<00:03:42.140> take<00:03:42.440> a<00:03:42.650> wet<00:03:43.010> clean

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
in between cuts you take a wet clean

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.430 
in between cuts you take a wet clean
cloth<00:03:43.850> and<00:03:44.090> wipe<00:03:44.660> off<00:03:44.840> the<00:03:45.019> blade<00:03:45.230> of<00:03:45.380> the

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
cloth and wipe off the blade of the

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.080 
cloth and wipe off the blade of the
knife<00:03:45.590> so<00:03:45.650> that<00:03:45.890> you<00:03:46.070> get<00:03:46.220> some<00:03:46.370> nice<00:03:46.519> clean

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
knife so that you get some nice clean

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.090 
knife so that you get some nice clean
cuts<00:03:47.480> you'll<00:03:48.080> notice<00:03:48.410> the<00:03:48.650> little<00:03:48.860> bit<00:03:49.040> of

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
cuts you'll notice the little bit of

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.040 
cuts you'll notice the little bit of
chocolate<00:03:49.310> on<00:03:49.489> the<00:03:49.670> top<00:03:49.700> of<00:03:50.090> the<00:03:50.150> fudge<00:03:50.360> that's

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
chocolate on the top of the fudge that's

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.660 
chocolate on the top of the fudge that's
because<00:03:51.380> the<00:03:51.530> knife<00:03:51.680> wasn't<00:03:51.920> clean<00:03:52.310> and<00:03:52.580> it

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
because the knife wasn't clean and it

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.130 
because the knife wasn't clean and it
has<00:03:52.790> a<00:03:52.820> tendency<00:03:53.030> and<00:03:53.330> make<00:03:53.450> them<00:03:53.570> look<00:03:53.720> messy

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
has a tendency and make them look messy

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.220 
has a tendency and make them look messy
I<00:03:54.970> stored<00:03:55.970> this<00:03:56.209> fudge<00:03:56.450> in<00:03:56.720> the<00:03:56.810> plastic

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
I stored this fudge in the plastic

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.170 
I stored this fudge in the plastic
container<00:03:57.260> with<00:03:57.800> a<00:03:57.830> tight-fitting<00:03:57.920> lid<00:03:58.550> I<00:03:58.730> put

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
it in between layers of waxed paper to

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.949 
it in between layers of waxed paper to
keep<00:04:01.340> it<00:04:01.459> from<00:04:01.580> sticking<00:04:01.790> together<00:04:02.090> and<00:04:02.480> I

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
keep it from sticking together and I

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.870 
keep it from sticking together and I
stored<00:04:03.290> it<00:04:03.410> in<00:04:03.500> the<00:04:03.620> refrigerator<00:04:04.280> not

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
stored it in the refrigerator not

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.009 
stored it in the refrigerator not
