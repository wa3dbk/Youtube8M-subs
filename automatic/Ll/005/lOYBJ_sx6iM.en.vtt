00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.710
 future news program created by 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.680
 supported by a network of stores of digital and 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.270
 computer technology 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.280
 hello everyone, this is news of the future all 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:27.199
 the most interesting of the world of science and high 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:29.359
 technology studio elena ivanova soon 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.789
 future seeing a person talking by 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.390
 banana as on the phone you are unlikely 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.449
 be surprised 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.129
 group of scientists from Tokyo University 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:39.079
 introduced a system that turns 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.030
 ordinary everyday items in 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.129
 computers or communication 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.600
 devices 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.639
 developers call their brainchild Jan 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.920
 act computer what can be translated as 

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:51.379
 activated computer or computer by 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.809
 the requirement the system constantly monitors 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.949
 for users of premises 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.109
 interprets his action most 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.479
 clearly this was demonstrated on 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.670
 example of a pizza box opening 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:04.489
 which is very similar to opening 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.590
 laptop seeing this movement system 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.180
 projects to the top cover short 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.160
 laptop screen image 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.830
 and on the basis appears virtual 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.900
 keyboard also if you take in hand and 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.480
 big items and bring it to your ear 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.450
 the car will understand that man needs a phone 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.670
 so the usual banana turns 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.770
 in a mobile phone when a person brings it 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.220
 COOK system activates telephone 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.290
 functions 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.300
 moreover, the set is parametric 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.120
 speakers picks up sound vibrations in 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:36.100
 narrow beam and it creates the feeling that the sound 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.100
 really comes from a banana 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.060
 researchers from usa and finland 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.159
 developed a contact lens with 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.470
 built-in display on which you can 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.539
 broadcast visual information 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.710
 true to the existing version of such a screen 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.320
 able to display 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.000
 just one pixel eye display 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.250
 is a regular contact 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.350
 a lens that girds a thin strip 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.479
 antennas for wireless recharging from 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.149
 external energy source on the edge 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.489
 lenses mounted microchip connected to 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.620
 blue sapphire led in the center 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.780
 developers managed to overcome one of 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.910
 key problems are not an opportunity for 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.540
 eyes focus on such a small 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.760
 the distance 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.830
 to overcome this property sight 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.470
 several layers were used 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.519
 ultrafine community less micron each 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.769
 fresnel lens 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.400
 but the developers have to decide the draw 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:33.049
 a number of problems for example the source material 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.690
 polyethylene terephthalate is too dense and not 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.580
 provides air flow to the eye except 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.530
 That distance at which you can charge 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.110
 device is only a couple 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.790
 centimeters in theory on such an eye 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.220
 the display can be broadcast short 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.900
 posts visual images including 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.660
 associated with objects in sight 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.200
 thereby forming augmented system 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.239
 reality 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.340
 the results of this work are published in 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.840
 Journal of Micro Mechanics and Micro Engineering 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.840
 about other updates further 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.690
 want to box but keep when 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.670
 this integrity of your person us 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.500
 sales began and robotic 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.360
 devices inside which is going 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.310
 man so that with the help of joysticks 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.010
 control the limbs of the machine and 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.269
 box with a sparring partner inside 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.730
 such boxing machine 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.040
 there are two independent joysticks for 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.019
 limb control and display on 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.720
 which shows the number of points and 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.700
 other parameters as in the ordinary box 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.730
 points are awarded for hitting the head 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.739
 opponent can observe the enemy 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.220
 through the lattice of the middle section of the robot 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.959
 which also serves for ventilation 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.060
 fuel engine provides 5 hours 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.370
 continuous operation robot is able 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.349
 move back and forth commit 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.349
 turns in any direction and develop 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.549
 speed up to five kilometers an hour 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:48.870
 entertainment is certainly more suitable 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.690
 for children from 8 years 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:56.069
 although judging by the height of the car there is quite 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:58.470
 be able to climb and adult participants 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.970
 Russian project displair developed 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.370
 device that projects 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.530
 any mother and media content right in 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.750
 air without screen display form 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.000
 right in front of the user full color 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.349
 bright and clear image or video 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.930
 high resolution 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.250
 besides, the projection is interactive 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.139
 supports multitouch 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.700
 and reacts to touch bare 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.459
 hands that is without special 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.200
 glove manipulators and so on 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:25.500
 It is known that analogues of this level 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:28.190
 measuring while this product is on 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.190
 end stage 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.169
 family pocketbook and replenished 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.330
 brand new type of dash for nothing or if you want 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.610
 pocketbook a10 tablet 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.680
 the manufacturer itself presents how 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.530
 multimedia reedak novelty possesses 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.949
 capacitive text display diagonal 10 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.639
 inches and 1024 by 768 resolution 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:48.770
 pixels 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:51.050
 which is able to recognize multiple 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.599
 touches at the same time as for 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.909
 reading then pocketbook a10 supports 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:57.889
 all major e-book formats for 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:05:00.949
 except for the specific 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.380
 amazon format both readability in 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:04.880
 This model is implemented thanks to 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.919
 optimal combination of background color and 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.659
 On the basis of the font 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.729
 studies have identified them 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:13.699
 best shades for maximum 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:15.919
 reading comfort on dough display a 10 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:19.069
 works on the android operating system 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:20.930
 2 and 3 has a smart processor 1 GHz and 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:22.909
 sufficiently capacious battery 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.789
 promised to work exercises 6 hours 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:27.860
 watching the video learn more about 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:29.840
 Pocketbook specifications 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.430
 a10 and buy new 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.729
 you can chain stores digital 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.729
 technology 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.560
 we somehow got used to that robots in 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.250
 mainly made of metal and 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.800
 plastic 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:45.229
 apparently therefore the creation of the company overlap 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.770
 seem so unusual the fact is that 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:51.259
 it's an inflatable robot and why not 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.780
 favor such robots say simplicity in 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:55.880
 maintenance and repair low cost 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.460
 safety when working among people and 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.919
 high ratio of power and weight 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.110
 overlap inflatable companies 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:05.060
 moves by pneumatic 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.669
 muscle and of course the movement of the prototype 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.590
 you look awkward for the time being 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:10.729
 this hybrid cockroach oh anteater 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.520
 named 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:17.120
 end roll weighs just 31 kilograms a 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:19.460
 can carry up to 450 kilograms to the same 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.190
 this rover can not travel 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:25.100
 only by land but also water and flounder 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:27.289
 this is an inflatable arm manipulator despite 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.780
 seemingly can even raise me 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:31.940
 loads of several hundred pounds at 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.389
 pressure in the system is about four from on 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.970
 connection 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:37.190
 and still on this blue miracle you can ride 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.199
 riding me and the program partner 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.599
 a network of stores of digital technology book 

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:43.990
 wish you good luck see you in the near 

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:43.990
 the future
