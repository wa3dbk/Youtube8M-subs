realized<00:02:02.630> I<00:02:02.959> haven't<00:02:03.409> really<00:02:03.590> just<00:02:03.770> practiced

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
realized I haven't really just practiced

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.630 
realized I haven't really just practiced
meat<00:02:04.579> eating<00:02:04.759> and<00:02:05.090> I<00:02:05.240> need<00:02:05.479> to<00:02:05.689> because<00:02:06.640> I'm

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
meat eating and I need to because I'm

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.359 
meat eating and I need to because I'm
good<00:02:07.909> at<00:02:07.939> it<00:02:08.119> if<00:02:08.479> I<00:02:08.660> practice<00:02:09.220> didn't<00:02:10.220> flow

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
good at it if I practice didn't flow

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.509 
good at it if I practice didn't flow
first<00:02:10.729> Chipotle<00:02:11.239> -<00:02:11.930> 25<00:02:12.349> seconds<00:02:12.829> then<00:02:13.250> I<00:02:13.280> tried

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
first Chipotle - 25 seconds then I tried

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.750 
first Chipotle - 25 seconds then I tried
a<00:02:13.549> second<00:02:13.910> one<00:02:14.030> took<00:02:14.180> 19<00:02:14.569> seconds<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:16.370> I<00:02:16.700> know

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
a second one took 19 seconds and I know

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.789 
a second one took 19 seconds and I know
I<00:02:16.850> could<00:02:17.090> do<00:02:17.150> it<00:02:17.239> faster<00:02:17.420> so<00:02:17.690> I'm<00:02:18.500> gonna<00:02:18.620> do

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
I could do it faster so I'm gonna do

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:19.990 
I could do it faster so I'm gonna do
some<00:02:18.950> practicing<00:02:19.400> that<00:02:19.519> I'll<00:02:19.640> actually<00:02:19.760> do<00:02:19.970> a

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
some practicing that I'll actually do a

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.390 
some practicing that I'll actually do a
video<00:02:20.239> if<00:02:20.810> you<00:02:20.930> guys<00:02:21.079> think<00:02:21.319> that<00:02:21.440> me<00:02:22.069> putting

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
video if you guys think that me putting

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.610 
video if you guys think that me putting
up<00:02:22.489> the<00:02:22.640> 25<00:02:23.000> and<00:02:23.180> 19<00:02:23.420> seconds<00:02:23.870> is<00:02:23.989> a<00:02:24.019> good<00:02:24.079> idea

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
up the 25 and 19 seconds is a good idea

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.930 
up the 25 and 19 seconds is a good idea

really curious need open to feedback on

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.060 
really curious need open to feedback on
this<00:03:26.250> one<00:03:26.600> I'll<00:03:27.600> be<00:03:27.720> doing<00:03:28.019> I'll<00:03:28.500> probably<00:03:28.800> be

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
this one I'll be doing I'll probably be

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.229 
this one I'll be doing I'll probably be
doing<00:03:29.600> pre-orders<00:03:30.600> on<00:03:30.780> this<00:03:31.080> pretty<00:03:31.380> soon<00:03:32.239> and

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
doing pre-orders on this pretty soon and

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.590 
doing pre-orders on this pretty soon and
then<00:03:33.330> take<00:03:33.540> about<00:03:33.720> four<00:03:34.019> weeks<00:03:34.170> to<00:03:34.410> make<00:03:35.600> but

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
then take about four weeks to make but

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.030 
then take about four weeks to make but
yeah<00:03:36.750> I<00:03:36.959> need<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.350> do<00:03:37.410> pre-orders<00:03:37.800> because

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
yeah I need to do pre-orders because

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.280 
yeah I need to do pre-orders because
sizing<00:03:38.550> is<00:03:38.670> really<00:03:39.120> really<00:03:39.660> different<00:03:40.140> and

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
sizing is really really different and

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.309 
sizing is really really different and
these<00:03:40.790> expensive<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:41.880> make<00:03:42.000> belts<00:03:42.420> so<00:03:43.080> it's

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
these expensive to make belts so it's

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.920 
these expensive to make belts so it's
not<00:03:43.470> like<00:03:43.590> I<00:03:43.680> can<00:03:43.800> just<00:03:44.209> think<00:03:45.209> about<00:03:45.330> sizes

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
not like I can just think about sizes

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.390 
not like I can just think about sizes
and<00:03:46.110> everything<00:03:46.470> because<00:03:46.800> everyone's<00:03:47.310> a

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
and everything because everyone's a

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.150 
and everything because everyone's a
different<00:03:47.670> size<00:03:48.410> I'm<00:03:49.410> for<00:03:49.650> example<00:03:49.980> like<00:03:50.069> a

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
different size I'm for example like a

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.440 
different size I'm for example like a
large<00:03:50.430> I<00:03:50.820> could<00:03:51.209> probably<00:03:51.390> yeah<00:03:52.290> but<00:03:52.680> a<00:03:52.709> large

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
large I could probably yeah but a large

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.729 
large I could probably yeah but a large
but<00:03:54.450> yeah<00:03:54.600> they<00:03:54.750> come<00:03:54.930> from<00:03:55.140> like<00:03:55.260> small<00:03:55.560> to
