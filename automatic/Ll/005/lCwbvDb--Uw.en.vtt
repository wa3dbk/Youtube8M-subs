00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 sage is a very big family of 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.600
 plants there are more than 900 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.379
 around the world on 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.040
 five continents 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.630
 among them the seven officinal sage 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.500
 aromatic sage to perfume so 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.150
 particular 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.680
 she is from the basin 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.300
 Mediterranean to her appreciates 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.580
 especially the most corners 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.800
 hot vegetable garden or terrace 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.380
 it takes the plant is sheltered from the wind 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.970
 in full sun in all types of 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.529
 lands for wants it to be well 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.050
 drained it can be installed 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.850
 independently in the ground or in pots 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.739
 and that's what I'm going to do in a 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.219
 balcony box to install next to 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.680
 barbecue 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.710
 once adult the sage form a 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.190
 small ball of 40 cm in height and in 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.840
 width 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.420
 so you have to plant them all 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.700
 the 40 cm is in pole finish tighten them 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.059
 a little bit to give a little more 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.180
 volume 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:01:01.890
 you need a pierced container for 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:01:04.260
 facilitate drainage for watering in 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.060
 you can let them go 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.040
 fend for themselves they are not 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.990
 very demanding in potted water 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.460
 you have to water the most 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.909
 regularly possible a potted plant 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.110
 is dependent on his gardener 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.990
 the interest of the sage is obviously 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.850
 its foliage a little silvery gray 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.520
 especially perfume the sage can 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.680
 also bloom June and July with 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.390
 flowers on the cob that are blue very pretty 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.250
 I will be able to enjoy this 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.140
 balconies for at least two years 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.990
 then when plans have become 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.159
 much bigger and well I could 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.650
 reinstall all his dreams in full 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.659
 earth the maintenance of sage is enough 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.299
 simple its foliage and persistent it 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.590
 can be semi persistent depending 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.290
 various they are much more 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.840
 harsh payet there to properly protect the 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.240
 foot and roots we can associate the 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.170
 sages in the kitchen garden or in a massif with 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.130
 plants that have needs 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.380
 identical 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.600
 this is the case, for example, with aromatics 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.159
 as marjoram thyme or 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.189
 rosemary and all these plants settles 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.500
 in the spring the officinal sage has all 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.780
 the benefits she is first scented 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.060
 but also they attract honey 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.099
 bees and the ability also to 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.550
 repel predatory insects like 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.020
 the aphids 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.940
 the first year it is useless to 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.320
 to harvest the sage the interest is 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.720
 that they can already develop at 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.150
 to make leaves in August you 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.340
 can cut soybeans 15 cm tall 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.770
 you will be able to harvest the leaves 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.310
 and young shoots my arrival just 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.770
 before winter 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.150
 the harvest is done with young people 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.790
 leaves that have a great taste 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.920
 softer is much more subtle and 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.070
 to harvest the sage that is there and 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.000
 dried pushes his head down 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.560
 so that they dry more 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.950
 quickly they will keep well any 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.950
 their flavor
