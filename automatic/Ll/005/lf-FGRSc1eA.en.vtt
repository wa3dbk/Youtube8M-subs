 today's guest is very unusual if 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:15.820
 i speak to such a chest today i would be on 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:18.480
 your andy 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.220
 the fact is that the original from the game shows in 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.440
 1996 and then such concepts are just 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.580
 on simply did not exist in fact it 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.300
 fan game 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:30.520
 authors torn texture sounds sprites from 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.300
 original doom and doom 2 after which 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:36.100
 made them here is a shaped arcade 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.469
 seriously they did didili lower 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.010
 side view platform with two dimensional 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:41.739
 graphics 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.109
 using a sprite from the house of one of 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.329
 first-person shooter 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:48.819
 who made two-dimensional ingenious ideas 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.949
 do not find but seriously play 

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:52.780
 this game is very interesting and it should be noted 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.449
 that the authors are not all pulled out of the game 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.339
 level given the two-dimensional essence they 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.409
 drew own plus they 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:01.539
 independently wrote music for the game 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:04.210
 does not know that he did not like the original 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:06.160
 but no less a figurative 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.450
 android it is made just brilliantly 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.980
 problems with graphics and foxes 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.930
 performance is not observed either on 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.430
 one of my devices is location 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.590
 virtual buttons tap them too 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.480
 ok and that i am separately pleasant 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.460
 gas learned zhelezyachki button home 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.960
 Chinese console so I donâ€™t even 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.570
 I had to use mappers there 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.460
 for reassigning the buttons , I found why 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.830
 just installed stupid launched 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.660
 and began to play mentally what can 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.300
 find fault so this is what's on the menu 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.710
 there is a two-player option 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.970
 select it in the menu and you can run 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.130
 second group in no way 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.560
 can not join ie from 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.000
 another phone can not connect in 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.980
 principle together with one device 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.230
 there is really no play 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.570
 under it there is no maybe I did not understand something 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.100
 but most likely it is just a bug that is 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.900
 during the transfer, they forgot to remove the excess 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.090
 menu will need to write about it 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.850
 what author can he somehow for some reason remove 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.710
 otherwise it's a great old arcade 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.870
 I want tentatively 10 years old and 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.090
 very rooted for example in some places 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.220
 totally hellish traps which are 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.020
 it's impossible to get out already 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.910
 you just need to restart the game at all with 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.680
 balance all not perfect felt that 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.990
 all such lovers worked but in 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.850
 the rest of the game is very enjoyable if you 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.400
 love old platformer sure 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.110
 try i'm sure you will like it but 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.550
 if you like doom try too 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.130
 it is very interesting to observe that 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.350
 turned out good old games on this 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.130
 Perhaps all thanks for your attention and to 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.130
 see you soon and bye
