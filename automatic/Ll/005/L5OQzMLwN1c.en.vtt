 special commission to correct 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.200
 evaluate the events in Ukraine situation in 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.389
 the republic is also the center of attention 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.160
 State Duma deputies appeared 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.960
 the message that the Russian parliament even 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.530
 can get ready for special closed 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.780
 meeting 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.520
 Now on the code row my colleague Nikolay 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.300
 Nikolaev he goes to a direct connection with 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.100
 studio nikolai what is known for this 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.850
 minute about specific statements in Ukraine 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.850
 Russian deputies 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.660
 Well, so far made such preliminary 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.759
 statements especially those depot deputies 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.380
 who came back today from Crimea 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.910
 futility was said that 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.850
 actually worked out 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.129
 Brzezinski geopolitical formula 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.440
 Russia Ukraine superpower without Ukraine 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.260
 vice versa and according to deputies 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.809
 returning from the Crimea in general is still considered 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.780
 and laws passed by the Supreme Rada 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.329
 legitimate legitimate yet too early 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.190
 in particular, of course, the law is concerned 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.710
 Russian language which before in Ukraine 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.770
 was law regional hits obviously 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.660
 it may already be here and so 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.680
 shared opinion returning from the Crimea 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.710
 MP Leonid senses 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.820
 but the law 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.060
 or forced assimilation or 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.000
 really 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.690
 departure of Russian speakers from Ukraine is not 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.550
 more no less today in the Crimea are being created 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.920
 armed detachment and resistance to 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.090
 particular party of russian unity this 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.450
 supervises and 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:31.659
 Supreme Council of Crimea and the situation 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.659
 reaches the highest degree of tension 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.619
 but it would be hard to say such a zion 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.420
