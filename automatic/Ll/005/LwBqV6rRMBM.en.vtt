00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:23.789
 I kill myself I'm happy troy and there were guys 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:25.710
 here in a video for the channel and in the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.529
 today's video we will be seeing a new 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.289
 theory for the month that kate scratched a 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.910
 0.12 points were new guys I hope 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.550
 that you are going to like this theory and 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.039
 well the theory is like that I think that in 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.530
 the latter 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:43.140
 I could tell if in the 12th will already 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.239
 be the ultimate good thing that I 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.579
 would refer this good I think this is going 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.960
 to be the last will since we have 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.269
 filled too many hoods and we already have 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.090
 get yes good the truth is that for 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:57.000
 have 11 have not arranged bush twitter 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.530
 that there is to correct but good I think that 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.109
 I am based on the last u and because they are 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.750
 too many but what comes 15 guys 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.240
 I do not believe these guys and good too 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.220
 it happens if you give some will say and good 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.420
 happy if you go to the final which will 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.960
 will happen with him 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.570
 and many guys and if you do not add in it the 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.610
 Spending on this version of Minecraft 0.6 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.860
 zero point but we're not going to have to 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.590
 wait for version 0.12 is made 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.030
 psychic zero point I have that we're not going to 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.960
 have to wait because it's still missing 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.659
 both to correct 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.080
 and there are still no signs of the gas that 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.780
 appears to your spanair or anything 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.050
 same guys but the thing what also 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.640
 you have to have it is confirmed but I think 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.450
 you probably already have for 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.310
 version of 0.12 points 0 and it is also 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.570
 running around there is a comfortable 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.640
 the networks that there would be a new 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.160
 mobile and well that is not an example 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.530
 but percent confirmed but good I 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.580
 I wanted to share them with you 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.450
 same boy I hope you liked it 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:59.240
 this theory because in the personal is what 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.310
 that I think is the last wheel 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.420
 and I just think it will not add anything 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.840
 great since they have given us so much to flee 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.460
 without adding great things only 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.200
 we correct minimum 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.780
 and I see guys the truth that I 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.970
 disappoints a little with this version the 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.390
 new microsoft only would you 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.590
 wait for the 0.12 point zero version and 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.050
 good guys and you know if you liked it 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.270

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.400
