00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.810
 what I usually do and what 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.900

 los santos is always new 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.950
 encounters we never expected this 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.320
 that we will find for the most part are 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.860
 nice but good sometimes need to know 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.860
 take out the weapons 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:24.729

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.320

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.390
 that there is trouble there we will go 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.130
 we will try to make our little 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.430
 carnage to put things back into 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.100
 order 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.660
 akono the size maggot is looking for shit 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.490
 the two of them I do not really like what I'm going 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:41.290
 to do I will not let myself go 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.700
 have it small I do not agree too much 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.700
 to show like shit like that 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:51.640
 because you are the son of your hand ho 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.080
 whore 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.940
 ok I feel like it's chasing me 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.940
 there and it pursues me 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:11.070
 oh damn oh no that's too little touch 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.350
 to get away oh no go I'm going 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.820
 join the two I will start and 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.200
 after I tried to run away because 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.200
 they will necessarily succeed to get me 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.090
 no but I did it on purpose I give 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.020
 hope to the opponent and after I the 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:37.680
 surprises and I want a little bit of this 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.790
 way sometimes see that now 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.880
 it's the cops who want to kill me 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.660
 it's not good and now direction 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.010
 airport 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.120
 ok I'm being sued and there is no 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.590
 that the cops and also the other two 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.990
 behind see the sow go this is 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.310
 gone I'm not what happened 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.310
 but in any case it is several months 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.440
 thus the dermis 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.440
 albator 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.099
 oh yes thank you thank you for saving me a 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.019
 count with his box with this car 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:11.430
 It's not going to be easy to 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.430
 the airport oh 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.880
 ok good there is one who lives on a train 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.910
 of listening to it's a life like 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.290
 the others must not criticize it happens 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.730
 everyone to live on oars 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:29.220
 of trains and people who tinker and 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.260
 drugged people too but that's a lot 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.610
 of things anyway this guy really has 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.170
 a weird life actually and now 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.640
 let's go to the airport and to both 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.290
 others who are fighting 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.480
 so I spent the two and a 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.690
 one who died ok it's feasible it's 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.690
 feasible 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.750

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.130
 no plane is normal I knew 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.140
 it was to laugh wanting to try something 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.040
 thing 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:04.319
 and the only thing I can do 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:06.420
 that's it I did it on purpose 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.800
 wanted I wanted to die 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.410

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.860
 I wanted mission accomplished I never 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:20.400

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:28.850
