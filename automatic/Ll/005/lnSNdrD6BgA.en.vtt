00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.680
 Hello 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:12.710
 I am always indebted 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:15.940
 Some do question I mean I is said Te camera work came from the direction Day 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.940
 I would like to explain 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.779
 It is such a kind of guy 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.470
 The reverse is 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.720
 I feel like this 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.260
 First 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:44.550
 Press the start button 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:49.030
 Nde there is the Tteyuu here in camera sensitivity of options method of operation 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.950
 Please try to practice it mended to do easy to position yourself 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.789
 I think it would be difficult to raise it a lot 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.360
 From the middle 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:01.510
 I think good to Kana chanting 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.510
 By the way, it is this position because I can not handle even if I back 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:14.950
 I think it's difficult while doing this dash from the beginning 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.950
 I think that it is good to practice in the state of this child c of Matsuo Shigeru 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.020
 It is the way 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.930
 I want to see the right stick in this state here 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.010
 When I get out 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.190
 It is muku, but the character also lives together, part 1 I live in that direction 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.190
 so 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.190
 Because 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:46.130
 In the direction opposite to the direction the camera was pointed 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.130
 It is said that the stick is put 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:53.510
 The character will run straight and only the camera will turn a little 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.930
 Like this 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.930
 Vice versa 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.479
 It is like this 

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:07.020
 Please while dash in and out down wait in this state 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.590
 It is like this 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.820
 Clear 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.520
 Oh like this 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.690
 Yes 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.360
 Please do your best
