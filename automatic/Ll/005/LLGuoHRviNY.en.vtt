00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello today i will show you how 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.610
 collect urine from cats for analysis 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.469
 it will help us in this way by name 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.540
 cartoon 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:14.219
 so if at least follow you collect 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.820
 extremely difficult but we will use 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.500
 special sand is not just sand 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.080
 described which is used to collect 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.750
 urine does not absorb moisture and fine 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.970
 going to take clean burdock 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.240
 go there this sand 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:34.440
 Now Murzik will help us in this matter 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:39.200
 And so here we imagine that now cat 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.969
 sat down to write so he studied and makes his 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:46.079
 makes his 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:49.980
 here he rummaged here forces peeing in 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:54.239
 the result of this writing is let me 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.910
 specially painted the writing turned out 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.469
 Here is such a little red water for this 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.210
 so you can see you see she does not 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.949
 absorbed not absorbed we take 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.640
 Special pipette she usually enters 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.340
 set 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.340
 and so we collect 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.330
 collect and pour well where are we there 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.580
 any pipette you want 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:26.030
 can for example made a different way 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:30.650
 take a needle syringe 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:35.810
 likewise close this syringe 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:38.610
 closed like this 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.509
 this is my little clean on her 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.350
 maybe more 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:46.350
 and put you in the fridge 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.799
 you can safely take this urine for analysis 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.990
 it will not contain any squeak 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:55.140
 all of us with Murzik cheeks wish you good luck 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.080
 in collecting a match under for collecting urine i 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:02.940
 I use special sets 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:05.910
 Set icon here it will not be 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.790
 but here it is just sterile now 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.670
 this tree can pour urine from it and 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:14.100
 carry on the analysis and that's what I said 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.980
 here are these with the snatches they too 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.150
 sterile includes a set and 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.520
 Respectively here he himself sand 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.800
 sand 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.870
 it is packed in such a container 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.830
 he is also sterile naturally 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:31.890
 clean but what it looks like you already saw 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.640
 Now that we showed you how 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.640
 collect urine
