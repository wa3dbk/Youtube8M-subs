00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.630 
today I've got some pretty decent call
of<00:00:03.689> duty<00:00:03.899> ghosts<00:00:04.140> information<00:00:04.740> and<00:00:04.950> we<00:00:05.430> could

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
of duty ghosts information and we could

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.519 
of duty ghosts information and we could
have<00:00:05.730> had<00:00:05.879> the<00:00:06.029> first<00:00:06.240> location<00:00:06.720> revealed<00:00:07.200> for

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
have had the first location revealed for

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.140

call<00:00:07.740> of<00:00:07.770> duty<00:00:08.069> ghosts<00:00:08.340> now<00:00:08.550> this<00:00:08.700> took<00:00:08.970> a

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
call of duty ghosts now this took a

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.790 
call of duty ghosts now this took a
little<00:00:09.510> bit<00:00:09.690> digging<00:00:10.080> out<00:00:10.200> because<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.650> call

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
little bit digging out because the call

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.680 
little bit digging out because the call
of<00:00:10.889> duty<00:00:10.920> website<00:00:11.519> has<00:00:11.969> been<00:00:12.000> updated<00:00:12.240> and

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
of duty website has been updated and

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.240 
of duty website has been updated and
that<00:00:12.870> was<00:00:12.960> pretty<00:00:13.110> obvious<00:00:13.230> and<00:00:13.799> the

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
that was pretty obvious and the

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.829 
that was pretty obvious and the
background<00:00:14.429> image<00:00:14.940> has<00:00:15.089> been<00:00:15.120> changed<00:00:15.690> so

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
background image has been changed so

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.930 
background image has been changed so
that<00:00:15.870> it<00:00:16.109> shows<00:00:16.289> two<00:00:17.100> separate<00:00:17.609> numbers<00:00:17.640> on

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
that it shows two separate numbers on

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.490 
that it shows two separate numbers on
the<00:00:18.029> right<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.539> smaller<00:00:18.720> number<00:00:19.109> at<00:00:19.410> the

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
the right and a smaller number at the

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.189 
the right and a smaller number at the
bottom<00:00:19.590> down<00:00:20.340> on<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.640> left<00:00:20.850> just<00:00:21.779> I'm<00:00:22.050> not

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
bottom down on the left just I'm not

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.689 
bottom down on the left just I'm not
really<00:00:22.350> sure<00:00:22.439> what<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:22.710> stands<00:00:23.130> for<00:00:23.250> still

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
really sure what that stands for still

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.269 
really sure what that stands for still
but<00:00:23.939> I'm<00:00:24.300> sure<00:00:24.869> as<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.199> piece<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.769> paint

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
but I'm sure as that piece of paint

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.800 
but I'm sure as that piece of paint
that's<00:00:26.609> covering<00:00:26.939> most<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.420> number<00:00:27.689> is

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
that's covering most of the number is

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.210 
that's covering most of the number is
revealed<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.380> will<00:00:28.710> reveal<00:00:28.949> more<00:00:29.160> information

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
revealed it will reveal more information

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.919 
revealed it will reveal more information
tools<00:00:29.849> which<00:00:29.970> will<00:00:30.090> make<00:00:30.210> more<00:00:30.390> sense<00:00:30.630> but<00:00:30.810> the

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
tools which will make more sense but the

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.569 
tools which will make more sense but the
one<00:00:31.109> on<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.320> right<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:32.130> one<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.520> is

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
one on the right is the one that is

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.000 
one on the right is the one that is
particularly<00:00:33.360> interesting<00:00:33.660> because<00:00:34.079> we've

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
particularly interesting because we've

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.350 
particularly interesting because we've
seen<00:00:35.219> called<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.700> do<00:00:35.820> things<00:00:36.090> like<00:00:36.239> this

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
seen called you to do things like this

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.790 
seen called you to do things like this
before<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:37.020> as<00:00:37.079> soon<00:00:37.230> as<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.440> saw<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.649> I

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
before and so as soon as I saw it I

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.970 
before and so as soon as I saw it I
thought<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.370> might<00:00:38.640> be<00:00:38.790> some<00:00:38.969> kind<00:00:39.270> of

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
thought it might be some kind of

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.660 
thought it might be some kind of
coordinates<00:00:40.980> or<00:00:41.190> something<00:00:41.520> like<00:00:41.610> that

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
coordinates or something like that

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.270 
coordinates or something like that
because<00:00:41.910> normally<00:00:42.450> they<00:00:42.600> do<00:00:42.660> reveal<00:00:43.500> some

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
because normally they do reveal some

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.490 
because normally they do reveal some
kind<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.670> locations<00:00:45.510> through<00:00:45.930> coordinates

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
kind of locations through coordinates

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.389 
kind of locations through coordinates
they<00:00:46.590> won't<00:00:46.739> give<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:46.980> straight<00:00:47.370> up

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
they won't give you straight up

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.889 
they won't give you straight up
information<00:00:47.730> say<00:00:48.149> hey<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.450> game's<00:00:48.570> going<00:00:48.809> to

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
information say hey the game's going to

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.660 
information say hey the game's going to
be<00:00:48.960> set<00:00:49.200> here<00:00:49.469> or<00:00:49.710> one<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.190> missions<00:00:50.340> going

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
those kind of dodgy places you know

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.510 
those kind of dodgy places you know
where<00:01:51.119> they<00:01:51.299> could<00:01:51.689> set<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.229> kind<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.890> game

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
where they could set that kind of game

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.670 
where they could set that kind of game
play<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:53.970> kind<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.360> setting<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.259> think

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
play that kind of setting so I think

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.899 
play that kind of setting so I think
this<00:01:55.740> could<00:01:56.009> be<00:01:56.130> one<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.490> first<00:01:56.759> places

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
this could be one of the first places

this could be one of the first places
