00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
that I wish it did a little better was

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.450 
that I wish it did a little better was
capturing<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:32.460> old-school<00:01:33.229> NHL<00:01:34.229> feel<00:01:34.710> like

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
capturing the old-school NHL feel like

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.030 
capturing the old-school NHL feel like
the<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.909> scoreboard<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.720> NHL<00:01:37.170> 14<00:01:37.409> all<00:01:37.920> the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
the the scoreboard is NHL 14 all the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.999 
the the scoreboard is NHL 14 all the
little<00:01:38.280> graphics<00:01:38.790> or<00:01:39.409> the<00:01:40.409> score<00:01:40.650> overlays

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
little graphics or the score overlays

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.649 
little graphics or the score overlays
and<00:01:41.040> everything<00:01:41.490> it's<00:01:41.700> it's<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.329> little<00:01:42.540> bit

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
and everything it's it's a little bit

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:43.910 
and everything it's it's a little bit
too<00:01:42.810> modern<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.409> think<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.680> would<00:01:43.770> have<00:01:43.860> been

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
too modern I think it would have been

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.080 
too modern I think it would have been
cooler<00:01:44.130> if<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.399> had<00:01:44.490> gone<00:01:44.520> back<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.970> the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
cooler if it had gone back to the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.179 
cooler if it had gone back to the
regular<00:01:45.240> like<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.079> black<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.500> white<00:01:46.710> gold<00:01:47.009> or

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
regular like the black and white gold or

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.730 
regular like the black and white gold or
whatever<00:01:47.610> that's<00:01:47.820> just<00:01:48.149> nitpicking<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:49.619> yeah

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
whatever that's just nitpicking so yeah

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.670 
whatever that's just nitpicking so yeah

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
every day I open up reason and try to

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.690 
every day I open up reason and try to
make<00:02:03.840> some<00:02:04.200> headway<00:02:04.439> it's<00:02:04.829> just<00:02:05.040> right<00:02:05.460> now

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
make some headway it's just right now

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.479 
make some headway it's just right now
it's<00:02:06.060> it's<00:02:06.930> hard<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.350> focus<00:02:07.560> on<00:02:07.979> just<00:02:08.399> one

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
it's it's hard to focus on just one

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.300 
it's it's hard to focus on just one
if<00:02:11.489> you've<00:02:11.849> ever<00:02:11.969> gotten<00:02:12.709> writer's<00:02:13.709> block<00:02:13.980> if

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
if you've ever gotten writer's block if

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.099

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
something this is the opposite of that

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.420 
something this is the opposite of that
really<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.319> I've<00:02:19.980> got<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:20.939> many<00:02:21.269> ideas<00:02:21.450> for<00:02:22.439> you

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.449 
to be you know all original tracks but
still<00:02:48.959> they're<00:02:49.379> good<00:02:49.620> ideas<00:02:49.980> that<00:02:50.159> I<00:02:50.189> want<00:02:50.370> to

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
still they're good ideas that I want to

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.940 
still they're good ideas that I want to

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
work on so that is pretty much what is

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.569

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:11.300 
that to kind of that's how my channel is
you<00:04:07.650> know<00:04:07.769> it's<00:04:08.159> not<00:04:08.310> just<00:04:08.669> one<00:04:08.879> genre<00:04:09.269> it<00:04:10.310> it

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
you know it's not just one genre it it

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.749 
you know it's not just one genre it it
kind<00:04:11.819> of<00:04:11.879> takes<00:04:12.090> away<00:04:12.269> from<00:04:12.449> the<00:04:12.689> flow<00:04:13.319> of<00:04:13.759> the

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:14.759 
kind of takes away from the flow of the

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:16.819 
kind of takes away from the flow of the
album<00:04:15.150> you<00:04:15.599> know<00:04:15.629> it's<00:04:16.169> kind<00:04:16.409> of<00:04:16.500> going<00:04:16.620> to<00:04:16.709> be

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
album you know it's kind of going to be

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.920 
album you know it's kind of going to be
choppy<00:04:17.489> but<00:04:17.880> I<00:04:17.940> think<00:04:18.450> it's<00:04:18.570> going<00:04:18.690> to<00:04:18.750> sound

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
choppy but I think it's going to sound

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.599 
choppy but I think it's going to sound
good

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
good

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.910 
good
so<00:04:21.609> yeah<00:04:22.090> pretty<00:04:22.300> much<00:04:22.389> there<00:04:23.380> is<00:04:23.470> no<00:04:23.620> release

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:23.920 
so yeah pretty much there is no release

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.750 
so yeah pretty much there is no release
date<00:04:23.950> yet<00:04:24.720> I<00:04:25.720> don't<00:04:26.350> want<00:04:26.530> to<00:04:26.740> give<00:04:27.010> myself<00:04:27.250> a

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
date yet I don't want to give myself a

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.659 
date yet I don't want to give myself a
release<00:04:28.330> date<00:04:28.360> because<00:04:29.169> that<00:04:30.070> puts<00:04:30.340> pressure

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
release date because that puts pressure

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.120 
release date because that puts pressure
