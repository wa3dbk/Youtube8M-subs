00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
you gotta 3,400 pounds stock car but the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.440 
you gotta 3,400 pounds stock car but the
wind<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.070> really<00:01:11.280> gusting<00:01:11.850> what's<00:01:12.060> sort<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.330> an

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
wind is really gusting what's sort of an

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.800 
wind is really gusting what's sort of an
issue<00:01:12.540> does<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:12.990> plane<00:01:13.460> well<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.700> just<00:01:14.909> when

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
issue does that plane well you just when

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.270 
issue does that plane well you just when
it<00:01:15.900> comes<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.320> gust<00:01:16.530> side<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.799> mean<00:01:17.040> if<00:01:17.159> it

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
it comes to the gust side I mean if it

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.740 
it comes to the gust side I mean if it
stayed<00:01:17.520> consistent<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.180> whole<00:01:18.240> time<00:01:18.540> it's

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
stayed consistent the whole time it's

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.410 
stayed consistent the whole time it's
the<00:01:18.869> same<00:01:19.049> for<00:01:19.200> everybody<00:01:19.439> but<00:01:19.860> if<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.640> if<00:01:21.210> you

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
the same for everybody but if it if you

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.050 
the same for everybody but if it if you
get<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> big<00:01:21.869> gust<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.259> wind<00:01:22.320> it'll<00:01:23.310> slow<00:01:24.000> you

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
get a big gust of wind it'll slow you

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.210 
get a big gust of wind it'll slow you
down<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:24.659> if<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.320> get<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.500> gust<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.890> wind<00:01:25.950> and

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
down so if you get a gust of wind and

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.530 
down so if you get a gust of wind and
the<00:01:26.310> next<00:01:26.520> guy<00:01:26.640> doesn't<00:01:27.060> then<00:01:27.210> it's<00:01:27.360> an

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
the next guy doesn't then it's an

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.050 
the next guy doesn't then it's an
advantage<00:01:27.869> for<00:01:28.200> him<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:28.640> you<00:01:29.640> just<00:01:29.850> hope<00:01:30.030> that

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
advantage for him so you just hope that

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.600 
advantage for him so you just hope that
