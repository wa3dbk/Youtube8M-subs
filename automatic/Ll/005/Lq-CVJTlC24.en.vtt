hello in today's video we will be adding

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:09.629 
hello in today's video we will be adding
a<00:00:05.930> second<00:00:06.680> hard<00:00:06.919> drive<00:00:07.220> to<00:00:07.999> an<00:00:08.090> HP<00:00:08.510> 25<00:00:09.019> 10<00:00:09.320> P

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:09.639 
a second hard drive to an HP 25 10 P

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:13.270 
a second hard drive to an HP 25 10 P
laptop<00:00:10.639> and<00:00:10.960> we<00:00:11.960> will<00:00:12.110> do<00:00:12.349> this<00:00:12.530> by<00:00:12.830> replacing

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.280 
laptop and we will do this by replacing

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.890 
laptop and we will do this by replacing
the<00:00:13.879> optical<00:00:14.360> drive

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
the optical drive

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.620 
the optical drive
so<00:00:15.740> before<00:00:16.100> we<00:00:16.219> start<00:00:16.250> anything<00:00:16.789> else<00:00:17.120> we<00:00:17.420> want

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
so before we start anything else we want

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.160 
so before we start anything else we want
to<00:00:17.720> make<00:00:17.960> sure<00:00:18.140> we<00:00:18.260> shut<00:00:18.590> down<00:00:18.620> the<00:00:18.980> laptop<00:00:19.430> and

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.170 
to make sure we shut down the laptop and

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:26.890 
to make sure we shut down the laptop and
remove<00:00:21.170> the<00:00:21.350> battery<00:00:24.190> the<00:00:25.190> HP<00:00:25.670> 25<00:00:26.240> 10<00:00:26.480> P<00:00:26.720> is<00:00:26.780> a

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
remove the battery the HP 25 10 P is a

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.130 
remove the battery the HP 25 10 P is a
great<00:00:27.230> nice<00:00:28.090> portable<00:00:29.090> laptop<00:00:29.570> the<00:00:29.870> only

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
great nice portable laptop the only

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.490 
great nice portable laptop the only
drawback<00:00:30.860> is<00:00:31.100> the<00:00:31.880> drive<00:00:32.149> capacity<00:00:32.840> or<00:00:33.440> the

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
drawback is the drive capacity or the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.650 
drawback is the drive capacity or the
hard<00:00:33.980> drive<00:00:34.220> that<00:00:34.250> comes<00:00:34.730> with<00:00:35.120> the<00:00:35.210> laptop

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
hard drive that comes with the laptop

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.940 
hard drive that comes with the laptop
which<00:00:36.290> is<00:00:36.440> a<00:00:36.470> 1.8<00:00:37.190> inch<00:00:37.400> drive<00:00:38.300> and<00:00:38.950> upgrading

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
which is a 1.8 inch drive and upgrading

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.120 
which is a 1.8 inch drive and upgrading
this<00:00:40.130> drive<00:00:40.610> you<00:00:41.060> are<00:00:41.240> rather<00:00:41.600> limited<00:00:41.990> as<00:00:42.560> far

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.130 
this drive you are rather limited as far

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.440 
this drive you are rather limited as far
as<00:00:43.460> capacity<00:00:45.579> so<00:00:46.579> we're<00:00:46.940> just<00:00:46.970> going<00:00:47.180> to<00:00:47.239> put

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
as capacity so we're just going to put

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.410 
as capacity so we're just going to put
this<00:00:47.570> cover<00:00:47.870> back<00:00:48.140> in<00:00:48.410> and<00:00:49.000> show<00:00:50.000> you<00:00:50.060> how<00:00:50.360> to

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
this cover back in and show you how to

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.990 
this cover back in and show you how to
upgrade<00:00:50.690> the<00:00:51.500> hard<00:00:51.890> drive<00:00:52.100> by<00:00:52.399> adding<00:00:52.850> a

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
upgrade the hard drive by adding a

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.610 
upgrade the hard drive by adding a
second<00:00:53.600> drive<00:00:53.840> onto<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:54.320> laptop<00:00:56.380> so<00:00:57.380> as<00:00:57.470> I

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
second drive onto the laptop so as I

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.889 
second drive onto the laptop so as I
mentioned<00:00:58.010> earlier<00:00:58.160> we<00:00:59.030> will<00:00:59.149> be<00:00:59.180> adding<00:00:59.780> a

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
mentioned earlier we will be adding a

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.799 
mentioned earlier we will be adding a
second<00:01:00.470> hard<00:01:01.340> drive<00:01:01.399> by<00:01:02.030> replacing<00:01:02.450> the

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
second hard drive by replacing the

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.179 
second hard drive by replacing the
optical<00:01:03.320> drive<00:01:04.869> so<00:01:05.869> the<00:01:05.990> optical<00:01:06.380> drive<00:01:06.859> is

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
optical drive so the optical drive is

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:09.700 
optical drive so the optical drive is
held<00:01:07.729> in<00:01:08.060> by<00:01:08.539> a<00:01:08.569> screw<00:01:08.899> at<00:01:09.049> the<00:01:09.079> bottom<00:01:09.319> of<00:01:09.590> the

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
held in by a screw at the bottom of the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.169 
held in by a screw at the bottom of the
laptop<00:01:10.719> after<00:01:11.719> removing<00:01:12.170> this<00:01:12.289> screw<00:01:13.179> then

00:01:14.169 --> 00:01:14.179 
laptop after removing this screw then

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:16.239 
laptop after removing this screw then
you<00:01:14.389> can<00:01:14.539> easily<00:01:14.659> slide<00:01:15.079> the<00:01:15.619> optical<00:01:15.770> drive

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:16.249 
you can easily slide the optical drive

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:19.219 
you can easily slide the optical drive
out

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.590 

so<00:01:20.229> over<00:01:20.560> here<00:01:20.830> we<00:01:21.070> have<00:01:21.400> a<00:01:21.760> hard<00:01:22.210> drive<00:01:22.360> caddy

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
so over here we have a hard drive caddy

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.410 
so over here we have a hard drive caddy
and<00:01:22.990> we<00:01:23.680> already<00:01:23.800> have<00:01:24.670> been<00:01:24.790> sold<00:01:25.060> a<00:01:25.150> hard

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
and we already have been sold a hard

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.399 
and we already have been sold a hard
drive<00:01:25.600> in<00:01:25.780> it<00:01:25.900> and<00:01:26.170> if<00:01:27.070> you<00:01:27.190> compared<00:01:27.580> it<00:01:27.700> to<00:01:28.409> we

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
drive in it and if you compared it to we

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.800 
drive in it and if you compared it to we
you<00:01:29.710> will<00:01:30.130> see<00:01:30.400> that<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:30.880> dimensions<00:01:31.600> are

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
you will see that the dimensions are

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.960 
you will see that the dimensions are
both<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.320> drive<00:01:32.650> caddy<00:01:32.979> and<00:01:33.280> the<00:01:33.520> optical

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
both the drive caddy and the optical

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.480 
both the drive caddy and the optical
drive<00:01:34.180> are<00:01:34.630> the<00:01:34.869> same<00:01:35.110> even<00:01:36.009> with<00:01:36.160> a<00:01:36.220> matching
