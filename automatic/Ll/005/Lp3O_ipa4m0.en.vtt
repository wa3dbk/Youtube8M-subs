so<00:00:01.589> this<00:00:01.770> is<00:00:01.920> say<00:00:02.330> 2002<00:00:03.330> Mazda<00:00:03.750> Tribute<00:00:03.959> and

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
so this is say 2002 Mazda Tribute and

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.820 
so this is say 2002 Mazda Tribute and
I'm<00:00:05.540> going<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.600> be<00:00:06.720> pulling<00:00:06.930> that<00:00:07.170> up<00:00:07.230> intake

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
I'm going to be pulling that up intake

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.209 
I'm going to be pulling that up intake
manifold<00:00:08.340> off<00:00:08.490> it<00:00:08.639> I've<00:00:09.300> really<00:00:09.920> undone<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:10.950> lot

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
manifold off it I've really undone a lot

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.910 
manifold off it I've really undone a lot
of<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.960> plugs<00:00:12.960> and<00:00:13.139> wires<00:00:13.259> that<00:00:13.530> you<00:00:13.710> have<00:00:13.799> to

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
of the plugs and wires that you have to

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.939 
of the plugs and wires that you have to
take<00:00:14.099> off<00:00:14.309> it<00:00:14.490> but<00:00:15.030> I'll<00:00:15.150> run<00:00:15.389> through<00:00:15.719> them

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:15.949 
take off it but I'll run through them

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.950 
take off it but I'll run through them
I'll<00:00:16.949> get<00:00:17.100> around<00:00:17.359> in<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.510> circle

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
I'll get around in a circle

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.000 
I'll get around in a circle
clock<00:00:20.689> there's<00:00:21.689> these<00:00:21.840> three<00:00:22.140> hoses<00:00:22.529> here

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
clock there's these three hoses here

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.400 
clock there's these three hoses here
which<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:24.150> haven't<00:00:24.300> found<00:00:24.630> in<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.900> manual<00:00:25.199> yet

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
which I haven't found in the manual yet

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.070 
which I haven't found in the manual yet
so<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:25.710> don't<00:00:25.800> know<00:00:25.920> what<00:00:26.070> they're<00:00:26.189> called

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
so I don't know what they're called

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.310 
so I don't know what they're called
but<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.230> have<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.910> undo<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.090> one<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:31.170> one

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
but you have to undo that one that one

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.130 
but you have to undo that one that one
that's<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.590> vacuum<00:00:31.949> hose<00:00:32.390> undo<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.540> one<00:00:33.719> and

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
that's a vacuum hose undo that one and

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.260 
that's a vacuum hose undo that one and
remove<00:00:34.440> them<00:00:35.989> this<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.410> EGR<00:00:38.100> vrv<00:00:38.760> which<00:00:39.030> is

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
remove them this is the EGR vrv which is

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:48.069 
remove them this is the EGR vrv which is
exhaust<00:00:40.140> gas<00:00:44.120> something<00:00:45.120> Eagle<00:00:45.600> exhaust<00:00:46.140> gas

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
exhaust gas something Eagle exhaust gas

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.310 
exhaust gas something Eagle exhaust gas
recirculation<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.590> it's<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:51.320> vacuum

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
recirculation and it's a vacuum

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.229 
recirculation and it's a vacuum
regulator<00:00:52.829> valve<00:00:54.230> there's<00:00:55.760> an<00:00:56.760> electrical

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
regulator valve there's an electrical

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.720 
regulator valve there's an electrical
clip<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.809> goes<00:00:57.840> there<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.469> if<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.520> unplug

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
clip that goes there and if you unplug

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.700 
clip that goes there and if you unplug
stuff<00:01:00.239> label<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.960> like<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.530> have<00:01:01.680> there<00:01:03.710> unclip

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
stuff label it like I have there unclip

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.429 
stuff label it like I have there unclip
that<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.220> there's<00:01:05.880> two<00:01:06.390> vacuum<00:01:06.840> plugs<00:01:07.170> at<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
that and there's two vacuum plugs at the

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.990 
that and there's two vacuum plugs at the
bottom<00:01:07.740> come<00:01:08.580> off<00:01:09.830> that<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:11.280> vacuum<00:01:11.729> plugs

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
bottom come off that that vacuum plugs

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000 
bottom come off that that vacuum plugs
like<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.210> network<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.810> clogs<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.770> also

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
like a network of clogs and that also

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.929 
like a network of clogs and that also
goes<00:01:14.340> into<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.790> EGR<00:01:15.650> up<00:01:16.650> here<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.670> just

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
goes into this EGR up here so that just

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.789 
goes into this EGR up here so that just
pops<00:01:18.150> off<00:01:18.360> that's<00:01:18.720> easy<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.049> one<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.470> bottom

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
pops off that's easy that one the bottom

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.070 
pops off that's easy that one the bottom
two<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.009> bit<00:01:20.490> harder<00:01:21.950> I<00:01:22.950> haven't<00:01:23.580> done<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.970> eg<00:01:24.869> a

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
two a bit harder I haven't done the eg a

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.880 
two a bit harder I haven't done the eg a
gas<00:01:25.409> pipe<00:01:25.710> yet<00:01:26.210> which<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.240> daring<00:01:27.900> yeah<00:01:28.290> try

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
gas pipe yet which is daring yeah try

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.190 
gas pipe yet which is daring yeah try
and<00:01:29.009> get<00:01:29.159> just<00:01:30.150> air<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.630> white<00:01:31.909> up<00:01:32.909> there

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
and get just air that white up there

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.539 
and get just air that white up there
unscrews<00:01:34.200> it's<00:01:34.500> kind<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.680> like<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.920> gas<00:01:35.130> not

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
unscrews it's kind of like the gas not

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.330 
unscrews it's kind of like the gas not
on<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.880> regular<00:01:36.390> gas<00:01:36.720> bottle<00:01:37.100> use<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.130> big

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
on a regular gas bottle use a big

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.789 
on a regular gas bottle use a big
shifter<00:01:38.729> or<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:39.060> spanner<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.600> get<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.840> off<00:01:39.960> but

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
shifter or a spanner to get it off but

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.819 
shifter or a spanner to get it off but
the<00:01:41.810> manual<00:01:42.810> says<00:01:43.079> just<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.409> pull<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.710> out<00:01:43.799> just

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
the manual says just to pull it out just

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.580 
the manual says just to pull it out just
enough<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:45.000> get<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.450> off<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.810> valve<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:46.560> that

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
enough to get it off the valve so that

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.639 
enough to get it off the valve so that
the<00:01:46.770> metal<00:01:47.310> pot<00:01:47.780> and<00:01:48.780> all<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.200> joints<00:01:49.409> are

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
the metal pot and all the joints are

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.660 
the metal pot and all the joints are
probably<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.250> little<00:01:50.310> bit<00:01:50.490> fragile<00:01:52.369> this<00:01:53.369> is

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
probably a little bit fragile this is

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.350 
probably a little bit fragile this is
the<00:01:54.680> AIC<00:01:55.710> plug<00:01:56.869> that's<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.520> IAC<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:00.030> sorry

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
the AIC plug that's the IAC it is sorry

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.340 
the AIC plug that's the IAC it is sorry
or<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.689> see<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.229> AC<00:02:01.710> unit<00:02:03.020> so<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.049> just

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
or a I see a AC unit so that just

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.719 
or a I see a AC unit so that just
unclips

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
unclips

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:13.160 
unclips
on<00:02:07.659> the<00:02:07.930> back<00:02:08.200> there<00:02:10.020> this<00:02:11.020> plug<00:02:11.350> here<00:02:11.650> is<00:02:11.920> the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
on the back there this plug here is the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.680 
on the back there this plug here is the

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
TPS the throttle position sensor that

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.420 
TPS the throttle position sensor that
just<00:02:16.959> unplugs<00:02:17.380> make<00:02:17.650> sure<00:02:17.800> you<00:02:17.950> label<00:02:18.160> all

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
just unplugs make sure you label all

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.610 
just unplugs make sure you label all
these<00:02:18.580> wires<00:02:18.850> as<00:02:19.120> you<00:02:19.240> go<00:02:22.050> this<00:02:23.050> is<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.260> air

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
these wires as you go this is the air

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.059 
these wires as you go this is the air
intake<00:02:24.360> which<00:02:25.360> just<00:02:25.660> unscrews<00:02:26.200> and<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:26.830> pulls

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
intake which just unscrews and it pulls

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.640 
intake which just unscrews and it pulls
off<00:02:27.250> I<00:02:27.430> pulled<00:02:28.000> this<00:02:28.180> off<00:02:28.420> to<00:02:29.230> make<00:02:29.380> it<00:02:29.410> a<00:02:29.530> bit

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
off I pulled this off to make it a bit

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.449 
off I pulled this off to make it a bit
easier<00:02:29.680> to<00:02:30.069> get<00:02:30.190> that<00:02:30.340> rubber<00:02:30.610> hose<00:02:30.970> off<00:02:31.209> and

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
easier to get that rubber hose off and

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.800 
easier to get that rubber hose off and
then<00:02:33.459> this<00:02:33.670> was<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:36.239> this<00:02:37.239> was<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.600> cruise

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
then this was the this was the cruise

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.680 
then this was the this was the cruise
control<00:02:37.900> and<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.769> throttle<00:02:39.130> cable<00:02:39.570> to<00:02:40.570> get

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
control and the throttle cable to get

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:41.699 
control and the throttle cable to get
the<00:02:40.810> throughout<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.170> cruise<00:02:41.350> control<00:02:41.380> just

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
the throughout the cruise control just

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.740 
the throughout the cruise control just
clips<00:02:42.280> out<00:02:42.430> but<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:43.390> throttle<00:02:43.750> cable<00:02:45.750> you

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
clips out but the throttle cable you

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.699 
clips out but the throttle cable you
have<00:02:46.930> to<00:02:47.080> pull<00:02:47.580> this<00:02:48.580> back<00:02:48.640> and<00:02:49.209> then<00:02:50.200> you<00:02:50.530> can

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
have to pull this back and then you can

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.580 
have to pull this back and then you can
slip<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.250> cable<00:02:51.280> out<00:02:51.730> makes<00:02:52.209> it<00:02:52.300> a<00:02:52.390> lot<00:02:52.480> easier

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
slip the cable out makes it a lot easier

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.540 
slip the cable out makes it a lot easier
it's<00:02:53.590> probably<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:53.950> only<00:02:54.069> way<00:02:54.220> you<00:02:54.280> can<00:02:54.430> do<00:02:54.519> it

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
it's probably the only way you can do it

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.360 
it's probably the only way you can do it
and<00:02:54.790> then<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:56.080> mounts<00:02:56.470> there<00:02:56.739> was<00:02:56.890> three

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
and then the mounts there was three

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.570 
and then the mounts there was three
bolts<00:02:57.760> for<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.000> mounts<00:02:58.209> two<00:02:58.390> there<00:02:58.630> and<00:02:59.580> one

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
bolts for the mounts two there and one

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.759 
bolts for the mounts two there and one
over<00:03:00.730> here<00:03:00.850> you<00:03:01.600> just<00:03:01.780> undo<00:03:02.110> them<00:03:02.290> and<00:03:02.530> they

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
over here you just undo them and they

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.880 
over here you just undo them and they
come<00:03:03.010> off<00:03:03.930> so<00:03:04.930> you're<00:03:05.140> gonna<00:03:05.260> undo<00:03:05.590> all<00:03:05.709> those

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
come off so you're gonna undo all those

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.860 
come off so you're gonna undo all those
first<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:07.350> we'll<00:03:08.350> go<00:03:08.500> from<00:03:08.620> there
