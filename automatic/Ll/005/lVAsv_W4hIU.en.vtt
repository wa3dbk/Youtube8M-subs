doorway in this lower doorway the reason

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.550 
doorway in this lower doorway the reason
being<00:02:39.820> is<00:02:40.239> that<00:02:40.269> as<00:02:40.630> you're<00:02:40.900> moving<00:02:41.019> away<00:02:41.290> from

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
being is that as you're moving away from

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.319 
being is that as you're moving away from
other<00:02:41.920> enemies<00:02:42.489> spawn<00:02:42.730> points<00:02:43.060> just<00:02:43.269> like

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
other enemies spawn points just like

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.840 
other enemies spawn points just like
that<00:02:43.570> one<00:02:43.720> there<00:02:43.930> they<00:02:44.620> only<00:02:44.890> happen<00:02:45.310> when<00:02:45.730> you

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
that one there they only happen when you

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.430 
that one there they only happen when you
move<00:02:46.060> away<00:02:46.209> so<00:02:46.420> it's<00:02:46.870> important<00:02:47.290> that<00:02:47.410> you

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
move away so it's important that you

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.470 
move away so it's important that you
keep<00:02:47.680> going<00:02:47.860> back<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:48.160> forth<00:02:48.549> making<00:02:49.060> sure
