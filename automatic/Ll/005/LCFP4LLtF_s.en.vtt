00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.740
 can teach how to put this fact so 

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:08.510
 beautiful highlights the process wraps 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.220
 certain things the first one is that it is 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.010
 discover a lot you have to have a lot 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.080
 patience and being very delicate 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:18.640
 especially with the woods we are not going to 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.949
 touch the moldings in special 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:25.310
 belonged to design for the world's 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:29.110
 colors of the walls but if we can 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:35.640
 move the saddle 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:35.640
 crown then enjoy this project 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.120
 carles how to install a very hard 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.870
 call comes by other names like the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.030
 verb is a speaker that is made to 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.300
 ceilings are removed from the texture that 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.830
 they have the ceilings and subsequently they are 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.290
 puts this finish and ends with 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:59.240
 painting with some senators for 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:02.570
 small holes and for the ceilings 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:06.680
 it is practically used to pay them 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:11.200
 a politician from idea that the mount of 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.200
 crown of the cornice is removed 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:19.110
 the line of the first to the plates 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.980
 the first sheets right for 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:26.610
 set a correct direction and in 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:31.140
 against or perpendicular against the support 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.780
 of the ceiling so they can be adjusted 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.410
 can clarify the woods or 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.450
 pin down against the rafters then like this 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.840
 is how you start first refers to 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.120
 the second molding removes the texture 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.790
 and studies then teach how and 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.580
 third good apart from that one tried 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.560
 Complies with wet white to remove 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.470
 the third dust are known to line up 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.530
 these fourth things will be prayed all the 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:03.590
 bunnies the holes and the joints and 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.590
 fifth is painted like this 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.000
 well these texts first of all 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.240
 we have to use some pistols 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.060
 pneumatic so we can ensure what 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.920
 Right 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:21.500
 subsequently, the areas must be measured 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.500
 the area of the pieces that are needed 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.790
 and cut the piece properly 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:28.530
 so 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.769
 you have to give him more or less a 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.609
 quarter of space to trim 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:37.160
 so to be able to play with the piece 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:41.170
 then once you give me 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.170
 you cut it 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.620
 and make sure that the measures are 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.590
 good is always important 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.440
 especially in materials that are very 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.350
 costly like these once one is given 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.410
 account that the measure is adequate 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.430
 you proceed to put the fer before this with 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:05.520
 construction adhesive very very 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:09.630
 resistant and what we're going to exclaim a 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:13.490
 little more resistance the product for 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:17.070
 that is more durable and and in a matter of 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:19.050
 humidity or a movement of the box 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.760
 have better resistance then always 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.180
 you have to get a good amount of 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:28.680
 this material once it is applied 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:31.290
 proceed to install and keep in mind that 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.359
 this has some nails where they fit 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.159
 nails that fit in a few cracks 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.159
 then having a lot of patience 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:44.040
 and once that is done 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.020
 you can continue installing the piece 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.540
 have a little patience do not you 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.210
 hit very hard not always 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.940
 a hammer 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.280
 available but do not do not use it 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.540
 just only using with a piece 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.540
 of wood or whoever helps them 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:08.990
 put the pressure in a way 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:12.680
 uniform without damaging or making the surface 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:16.340
 because the roof has been installed east this 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.620
 finishing the ceiling because obviously it 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.080
 you have to be careful to do 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.890
 the small holes that are relevant 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.890
 to the lights 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:30.170
 once you can see that almost 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.780
 they have no flaws and that is why 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:36.690
 one by one we are closing with 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:39.690
 special materials designed for that 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.760
 kind of work we are covering all 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.280
 the holes can use a 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.610
 spatula or during your fingers or any 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:52.050
 other material and using a sponge 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:55.560
 they are going to remove the material that is left 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.570
 material is easy to use then 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.110
 that way you're preparing for 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:04.550
 be able to use the finished painting 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.550
 finished in a matte finish 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:11.090
 in fact it has been fixed and 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.060
 has been properly cleaned 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:19.150
 we proceed to put the finished painting 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.150
 and buying is almost decisive 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:28.940
 hard of crown using a gun 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:32.420
 pneumatic working inch 2 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:35.720
 inches and make sure the corners 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:38.480
 first of all they are fine 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:41.260
 square and then put some sides 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:44.260
 it can be reviewed and I finished ensuring 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
 properly
