happening son and so what release was
going<00:03:29.550> on<00:03:29.700> is<00:03:29.910> that<00:03:30.000> they're<00:03:30.150> basically<00:03:30.360> like

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
going on is that they're basically like

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.150 
going on is that they're basically like
sending<00:03:30.930> coupons<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:31.590> people<00:03:31.890> after<00:03:32.070> they

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
buy an order everything like that so I

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.820 
buy an order everything like that so I
mean<00:03:33.900> this<00:03:33.959> I<00:03:34.080> guess<00:03:34.230> looks<00:03:34.410> like<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.620> appeal

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
mean this I guess looks like the appeal

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.229 
mean this I guess looks like the appeal
of<00:03:34.860> it<00:03:35.100> or<00:03:35.190> something<00:03:35.310> but<00:03:35.580> that's<00:03:35.700> really<00:03:35.940> all

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
of it or something but that's really all

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.759 
of it or something but that's really all
that<00:03:36.570> really<00:03:36.900> doing<00:03:37.320> this<00:03:37.380> not<00:03:37.530> really

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
that really doing this not really

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.860 
that really doing this not really
anything<00:03:38.010> too<00:03:38.400> extravagant<00:03:39.060> either<00:03:39.660> place
