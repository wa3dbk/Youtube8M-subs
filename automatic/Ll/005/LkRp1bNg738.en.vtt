00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459

and<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.760> character<00:02:18.060> looks<00:02:18.240> pretty<00:02:18.480> similar

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
and the character looks pretty similar

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.570 
and the character looks pretty similar
so<00:02:19.260> I<00:02:19.290> would<00:02:19.470> like<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.680> start<00:02:19.920> from<00:02:20.010> four<00:02:20.250> III

when I get the game myself I'm gonna try
to<00:02:22.470> use<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.650> lot<00:02:22.800> of<00:02:22.920> characters<00:02:23.250> though<00:02:23.400> okay<00:02:24.210> I

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
to use a lot of characters though okay I

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.030 
to use a lot of characters though okay I
agree<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:24.720> agree<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:25.230> are<00:02:25.260> known<00:02:25.560> for<00:02:25.740> using<00:02:25.860> a

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
lot of characters of melee so I would

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.970 
lot of characters of melee so I would
suspect<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:27.900> use<00:02:28.020> a<00:02:28.050> lot<00:02:28.350> in<00:02:28.590> smash<00:02:28.950> 4

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
suspect that you use a lot in smash 4
