00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.750 
let me hit that guy it will kind of
freeze<00:02:15.780> them<00:02:16.019> in<00:02:16.049> place<00:02:16.350> for<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.650> few<00:02:16.829> seconds

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
freeze them in place for a few seconds

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.790 
freeze them in place for a few seconds
and<00:02:19.360> then<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.540> third<00:02:19.750> attack<00:02:20.050> is<00:02:20.319> this<00:02:20.500> kind

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
and then the third attack is this kind

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.710 
and then the third attack is this kind
of<00:02:20.920> rain<00:02:21.129> of<00:02:21.310> fire<00:02:21.519> stuff<00:02:22.030> where<00:02:22.330> I<00:02:24.629> mean<00:02:25.629> this

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
of rain of fire stuff where I mean this

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.729 
of rain of fire stuff where I mean this
that's<00:02:26.019> just<00:02:26.230> ridiculous

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
that's just ridiculous

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.910 
that's just ridiculous
I<00:02:26.860> think<00:02:27.190> this<00:02:27.340> is<00:02:27.489> unfair<00:02:27.879> like<00:02:28.650> raining<00:02:29.650> fire

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
I think this is unfair like raining fire

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.729 
I think this is unfair like raining fire
and<00:02:30.420> then<00:02:31.420> on<00:02:31.540> top<00:02:31.780> of<00:02:31.840> that<00:02:32.019> you<00:02:32.319> can<00:02:32.440> sort<00:02:32.680> of

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
and then on top of that you can sort of

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.970 
and then on top of that you can sort of
do<00:02:33.010> adjustments<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:33.909> can<00:02:33.940> hit<00:02:34.239> me<00:02:34.569> the<00:02:35.349> second

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
do adjustments you can hit me the second

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.350 
do adjustments you can hit me the second
attack<00:02:36.280> and<00:02:36.610> they'll<00:02:36.700> do<00:02:36.819> like<00:02:36.970> a<00:02:37.030> spin<00:02:39.360> pretty

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
attack and they'll do like a spin pretty

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.970 
attack and they'll do like a spin pretty
insane<00:02:40.750> or<00:02:41.200> you<00:02:41.410> can<00:02:41.650> drain<00:02:42.010> a<00:02:42.040> fire<00:02:42.459> and<00:02:42.819> I

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
insane or you can drain a fire and I

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.430 
insane or you can drain a fire and I
don't<00:02:44.980> know<00:02:45.040> it's<00:02:45.280> crazy<00:02:46.110> they'll<00:02:47.110> you<00:02:47.410> know

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
don't know it's crazy they'll you know

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.470 
don't know it's crazy they'll you know
like<00:02:47.950> mostly<00:02:48.370> of<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.549> gents<00:02:48.879> though<00:02:49.030> is<00:02:49.150> slow

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
like mostly of the gents though is slow

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.880 
like mostly of the gents though is slow
so<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:51.730> is<00:02:51.940> possible<00:02:52.420> for<00:02:52.450> like<00:02:52.810> a<00:02:53.079> bunch<00:02:53.709> of

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
so it is possible for like a bunch of

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.970 
so it is possible for like a bunch of
little<00:02:54.549> guys<00:02:54.849> to<00:02:54.879> kind<00:02:55.360> of<00:02:55.450> nip<00:02:56.200> at<00:02:56.410> you<00:02:56.680> a<00:02:56.709> few
