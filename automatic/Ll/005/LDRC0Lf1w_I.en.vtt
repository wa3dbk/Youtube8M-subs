on jun 9

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.030 
on jun 9
one<00:02:12.950> of<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.130> days<00:02:13.310> of<00:02:13.630> WWDC<00:02:14.630> 2011<00:02:15.320> that's<00:02:15.770> one

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
one of the days of WWDC 2011 that's one

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.130 
one of the days of WWDC 2011 that's one
of<00:02:16.160> apples<00:02:16.880> events<00:02:17.210> so<00:02:17.390> this<00:02:17.900> is<00:02:17.990> probably

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
of apples events so this is probably

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.720 
of apples events so this is probably
something<00:02:18.350> that<00:02:18.500> what<00:02:19.130> both<00:02:19.310> mobile<00:02:19.520> and

sprint are working on compete against
Apple<00:02:22.010> it<00:02:22.460> may<00:02:22.580> be<00:02:22.640> like<00:02:22.880> seal<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.330> news<00:02:23.540> for

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
that day but this new thing it could be

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.460 
that day but this new thing it could be
all<00:02:26.360> kinds<00:02:26.390> of<00:02:26.750> things<00:02:26.930> but<00:02:27.080> we're<00:02:27.230> kind<00:02:27.440> of

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
all kinds of things but we're kind of

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.440 
all kinds of things but we're kind of
think<00:02:27.650> it's<00:02:27.770> going<00:02:27.860> to<00:02:27.950> be<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.450> motorola

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
think it's going to be the motorola

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.440 
think it's going to be the motorola
photon<00:02:29.990> 4g<00:02:30.650> would<00:02:30.770> kind<00:02:31.130> of<00:02:31.220> be<00:02:31.370> kind<00:02:31.850> of<00:02:31.940> going

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
photon 4g would kind of be kind of going

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.080 
photon 4g would kind of be kind of going
to<00:02:32.510> be<00:02:32.660> like<00:02:32.840> it<00:02:33.110> atrix<00:02:34.100> 4g<00:02:34.160> would<00:02:34.640> have<00:02:34.730> sprint

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
to be like it atrix 4g would have sprint

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.330 
to be like it atrix 4g would have sprint
into<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.690> smaller<00:02:36.170> room<00:02:36.410> you<00:02:36.500> can<00:02:36.620> have<00:02:36.710> a<00:02:36.740> 4.3

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
into the smaller room you can have a 4.3

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.460 
into the smaller room you can have a 4.3
inch<00:02:37.460> screen<00:02:37.550> which<00:02:38.180> is<00:02:38.210> much<00:02:38.450> bigger<00:02:38.750> and<00:02:39.110> a

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
inch screen which is much bigger and a

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.600 
inch screen which is much bigger and a
bigger<00:02:39.650> screen<00:02:39.800> will<00:02:39.980> be<00:02:40.010> nice<00:02:40.220> but<00:02:40.400> it<00:02:40.520> will

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
bigger screen will be nice but it will

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.570 
bigger screen will be nice but it will
have<00:02:40.730> like<00:02:40.970> a<00:02:41.000> similar<00:02:41.570> atrix<00:02:42.500> tile<00:02:42.740> like

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
have like a similar atrix tile like

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.520 
have like a similar atrix tile like
laptop<00:02:44.090> they<00:02:44.540> can<00:02:44.660> get<00:02:44.780> probably<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.350> same

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
laptop they can get probably the same

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.020 
laptop they can get probably the same
price<00:02:45.800> two<00:02:46.010> hundred<00:02:46.220> dollars<00:02:46.460> plus<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.820> three

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
price two hundred dollars plus the three

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.240 
price two hundred dollars plus the three
hundred<00:02:47.240> dollars<00:02:47.510> to<00:02:48.050> get<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.440> laptop<00:02:48.890> dock

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
hundred dollars to get the laptop dock

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.340 
hundred dollars to get the laptop dock
so<00:02:49.910> this<00:02:50.060> is<00:02:50.210> kind<00:02:50.690> of<00:02:50.720> a<00:02:50.840> neat<00:02:51.050> thing<00:02:51.080> of

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
so this is kind of a neat thing of

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.960 
so this is kind of a neat thing of
looking<00:02:51.590> at<00:02:51.740> and<00:02:52.190> hopefully<00:02:52.640> they'll<00:02:52.730> turn

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
looking at and hopefully they'll turn

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.610 
looking at and hopefully they'll turn
out<00:02:53.000> well<00:02:53.510> we<00:02:53.720> don't<00:02:53.840> know<00:02:54.140> if<00:02:54.320> it's<00:02:54.470> all

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.830 
hopefully it will come out as in sprint
they<00:03:04.310> don't<00:03:04.490> have<00:03:04.610> a<00:03:04.640> whole<00:03:04.880> lot<00:03:04.910> of<00:03:05.120> really

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
they don't have a whole lot of really

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.090 
they don't have a whole lot of really
nice<00:03:05.959> android<00:03:06.320> phones<00:03:06.500> although<00:03:06.770> they<00:03:06.950> have<00:03:07.070> a

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
nice android phones although they have a

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.810 
nice android phones although they have a
few<00:03:07.370> good<00:03:07.580> ones<00:03:07.730> like<00:03:08.300> the<00:03:08.420> nexus<00:03:08.750> s<00:03:08.840> 4g<00:03:08.900> and

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
few good ones like the nexus s 4g and

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.240 
few good ones like the nexus s 4g and
assume<00:03:10.820> they<00:03:11.060> could<00:03:11.180> be<00:03:11.330> the<00:03:11.510> HTC<00:03:12.020> EVO<00:03:12.470> 3d

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
assume they could be the HTC EVO 3d

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.220 
assume they could be the HTC EVO 3d
which<00:03:13.640> is<00:03:13.760> given<00:03:13.850> another<00:03:14.090> good<00:03:14.330> one<00:03:14.510> so<00:03:14.780> i'm

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
which is given another good one so i'm

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.870 
which is given another good one so i'm

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
looking forward to this and it'll

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.690

probably<00:03:17.690> come<00:03:17.870> out<00:03:17.989> on<00:03:18.170> jun<00:03:18.410> 9th<00:03:18.650> on<00:03:19.550> the

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
probably come out on jun 9th on the

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.280 
probably come out on jun 9th on the
event<00:03:19.970> but<00:03:20.330> we're<00:03:20.540> not<00:03:20.660> sure<00:03:20.870> what<00:03:20.989> they<00:03:21.140> have

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.840 
event but we're not sure what they have
done<00:03:21.320> now<00:03:21.590> it's<00:03:21.950> probably<00:03:22.160> something<00:03:22.489> big

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
done now it's probably something big

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.720 
done now it's probably something big
