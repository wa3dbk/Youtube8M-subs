00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.080
 hello guys that such a good welcome to 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:08.240
 a new video this time and it was good 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.820
 has happened to me the idea results from that 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.829
 Many of you, you ask me 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.990
 information about some characters 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:17.300
 because you think that nothing has gone up 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.849
 from them to the channel because it may well be 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.890
 it can almost be brush can be mark 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:24.560
 duggan riu etcetera according steve 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.080
 oxford is today and with all of them and 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.800
 many more because I've made videos to 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.829
 markin 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.270
 bryant then what happens it occurred to me 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:33.680
 the idea that I think this may be from 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.720
 help for all of you because 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.300
 I understand that they are beginning to see many 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.310
 videos on the channel and that therefore 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:44.510
 many then go unnoticed 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:46.510
 in 400 and pico videos that we already 450 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.839
 or 430 remind us 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.120
 Of course, I know that you are not going to 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:53.680
 put to look for then certain videos do not 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.670
 there are things that I understand then what 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.879
 it occurred to me is to make a small 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.350
 summary and for that what better you can 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.969
 put all the videos that I think 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.260
 Well, what can be of interest to 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.780
 all of you 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.850
 well combos tutorials and so on 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.979
 that I think they can contribute something 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.350
 positive and that suddenly because people who 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.000
 just arrived new for them 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.500
 they go totally unnoticed and 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.390
 even for many of you already 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.720
 you have been here for a long time not following me in the 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.310
 channel and so on so good really 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.380
 I hope this really helps you 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.330
 we collect a little more information 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.710
 about the videos that are 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.590
 they find in the channel and I say that 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.330
 they can really be useful and that's good 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.210
 with this, let's help a lot more 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.880
 people thats all thank you a 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.560
 Again, because if you, well, good 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.069
 both fight club and the channel itself 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.759
 because it would not exist, that's clear and 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:44.369
 what happens 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.740
 well, I will always keep in mind 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.959
 this is one of the few things that I have not 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.040
 left aside always being one 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:54.350
 person who has started a lot 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.350
 things and always finished by not doing 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.150
 then nothing is something that motivates me 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.620
 it is me that makes me be here especially 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.260
 Well, I'm talking about you, 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.370
 logically and good guys I do not roll up 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.170
 more that's all 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.090
 and remember to subscribe comment 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.619
 share to see what you think 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.570
 especially comment to see what you think 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.160
 the idea of then contribute this video to 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.690
 channel I think it can be helpful and 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.700
 that's all boys a hug be 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.140
