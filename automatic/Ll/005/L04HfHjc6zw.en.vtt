absorber<00:01:20.470> itself<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:22.810> sequence<00:01:23.410> is<00:01:24.240> exactly

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
absorber itself this sequence is exactly

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.020 
absorber itself this sequence is exactly
the<00:01:25.450> same<00:01:25.690> as<00:01:26.290> if<00:01:26.980> I<00:01:27.130> was<00:01:27.340> changing<00:01:27.790> a<00:01:27.910> rear

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.710 
tire so as you can see there's quite a
little<00:01:32.290> bit<00:01:32.410> involved<00:01:32.710> in<00:01:33.180> just<00:01:34.180> getting<00:01:34.570> to

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
the retaining bolts for the wheel and

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.540 
the retaining bolts for the wheel and
there's<00:01:46.900> the<00:01:47.140> wheel<00:01:47.320> now<00:01:47.710> pulley<00:01:48.190> go<00:01:48.400> any

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
there's the wheel now pulley go any

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:56.380 
there's the wheel now pulley go any
further<00:01:48.760> I<00:01:48.940> need<00:01:49.180> to<00:01:49.330> drain<00:01:49.660> the<00:01:50.010> engine<00:01:51.010> oil
