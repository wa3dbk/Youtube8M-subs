some<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.530> these<00:00:46.590> things<00:00:46.800> would<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.280> be<00:00:47.430> real<00:00:47.670> in

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850

these things were real in the real world

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.139 
these things were real in the real world
then<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.739> real<00:00:53.010> world<00:00:53.309> would<00:00:53.579> be<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.760> way

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
then the real world would be a way

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.029 
then the real world would be a way
better<00:00:54.329> place<00:00:54.660> first<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.230> all<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:55.980> many

into that I'm still like in first series

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.630 
into that I'm still like in first series
but<00:03:50.810> it's<00:03:51.110> really<00:03:51.620> sad<00:03:51.950> it<00:03:52.070> ended<00:03:52.400> because<00:03:52.550> you

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
but it's really sad it ended because you

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.370 
but it's really sad it ended because you
know<00:03:52.730> I<00:03:52.970> really<00:03:53.540> liked<00:03:53.720> it<00:03:53.870> from<00:03:54.080> what<00:03:54.260> I've

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
know I really liked it from what I've

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.990 
know I really liked it from what I've
seen<00:03:54.410> in<00:03:54.680> a<00:03:54.740> bit<00:03:54.890> so<00:03:55.220> it's<00:03:55.370> really<00:03:55.490> sad<00:03:55.820> that

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
seen in a bit so it's really sad that

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.540 
seen in a bit so it's really sad that
it's<00:03:56.150> ending<00:03:56.240> after<00:03:56.690> so<00:03:57.050> long<00:03:57.080> but<00:03:57.770> I<00:03:57.980> guess<00:03:58.310> we

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
it's ending after so long but I guess we

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.850 
it's ending after so long but I guess we
tended<00:03:58.910> to<00:03:59.090> after<00:03:59.900> going<00:04:00.170> on<00:04:00.290> for<00:04:00.440> a<00:04:00.470> long<00:04:00.620> time

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
tended to after going on for a long time

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.680 
tended to after going on for a long time
so<00:04:01.070> I<00:04:01.100> guess<00:04:01.250> that's<00:04:01.370> what<00:04:01.550> happens<00:04:01.730> but<00:04:02.510> I

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
so I guess that's what happens but I

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.240 
so I guess that's what happens but I
just<00:04:02.900> find<00:04:03.140> it<00:04:03.290> really<00:04:03.320> sad<00:04:03.770> because<00:04:03.980> these

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
just find it really sad because these

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.460 
just find it really sad because these
things<00:04:04.490> go<00:04:04.670> on<00:04:04.700> for<00:04:05.000> so<00:04:05.180> long<00:04:05.210> and<00:04:05.660> then<00:04:06.140> I<00:04:06.260> just

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
things go on for so long and then I just

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.140 
things go on for so long and then I just
end<00:04:06.650> it<00:04:07.070> it's<00:04:07.190> really<00:04:07.340> sad<00:04:07.670> that<00:04:07.700> something

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
end it it's really sad that something

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.940 
end it it's really sad that something
gets<00:04:08.510> too<00:04:08.720> attached<00:04:09.020> to<00:04:09.050> and<00:04:09.410> your<00:04:09.530> life<00:04:09.680> just

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.020 
we looked so stupid and the drawing art
style<00:04:39.110> was<00:04:39.320> not<00:04:39.350> even<00:04:40.070> good<00:04:40.250> at<00:04:40.280> all<00:04:40.550> to<00:04:40.910> be

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
style was not even good at all to be

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.090 
style was not even good at all to be
honest<00:04:41.420> I<00:04:41.660> feel<00:04:42.020> like<00:04:42.140> I<00:04:42.230> could<00:04:42.470> draw<00:04:42.680> that<00:04:42.710> no

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
honest I feel like I could draw that no

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.860 
honest I feel like I could draw that no
problem<00:04:43.550> and<00:04:43.700> a<00:04:43.760> lot<00:04:43.910> of<00:04:43.940> me<00:04:44.120> look<00:04:44.330> at<00:04:44.480> his<00:04:44.630> job

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870

at<00:04:45.110> no<00:04:45.320> problem<00:04:45.710> so<00:04:46.220> it<00:04:46.550> just<00:04:46.730> kind<00:04:46.940> of<00:04:46.970> seems

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
at no problem so it just kind of seems

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.910 
at no problem so it just kind of seems
like<00:04:47.240> a<00:04:47.330> lot<00:04:47.570> of<00:04:47.600> cartoons<00:04:48.020> are<00:04:48.350> starting<00:04:48.800> to
