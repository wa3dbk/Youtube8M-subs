00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.959 
know so the beginning the introduction
is<00:00:35.460> just<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.910> g4<00:00:36.480> eight<00:00:36.660> bars<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.670> UM

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
is just a g4 eight bars the and the UM

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.959 
is just a g4 eight bars the and the UM
the<00:00:39.690> strumming<00:00:39.989> pattern<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:41.370> can<00:00:41.520> do<00:00:41.670> any

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
the strumming pattern is you can do any

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.660 
the strumming pattern is you can do any
shown<00:00:42.300> person<00:00:42.660> really<00:00:42.930> but<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.640> what<00:00:44.640> I

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
shown person really but and what I

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.090 
shown person really but and what I
prefer<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.059> do<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.570> um<00:00:46.190> this<00:00:47.190> one<00:00:48.920> so<00:00:49.920> that's

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
prefer to do is um this one so that's

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.979 
prefer to do is um this one so that's
down<00:00:50.550> up<00:00:50.910> down<00:00:50.940> lick<00:00:51.870> down<00:00:52.620> up<00:00:53.010> down<00:00:53.070> down<00:00:53.989> down

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
down up down lick down up down down down

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.760 
down up down lick down up down down down
down<00:00:55.379> down<00:00:55.770> up<00:00:55.800> down<00:00:56.690> up<00:00:57.690> down<00:00:57.809> down<00:00:58.289> up<00:00:58.620> down

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
down down up down up down down up down

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:09.410 
down down up down up down down up down
down<00:00:59.280> down<00:00:59.640> up<00:01:03.260> sit<00:01:04.260> down<00:01:04.760> down<00:01:05.760> up<00:01:06.090> down<00:01:08.420> up

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
down down up sit down down up down up

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:19.000 
down down up sit down down up down up
down<00:01:09.540> down<00:01:10.229> down<00:01:11.010> down<00:01:11.369> up<00:01:12.350> so<00:01:13.350> it'll<00:01:13.710> be

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:27.469 

ok<00:01:23.659> that's<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.810> slow<00:01:25.790> so<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.970> beginning<00:01:27.330> is

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
ok that's it slow so the beginning is

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.649 
ok that's it slow so the beginning is
just<00:01:30.200> that's<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.290> bit<00:01:31.440> faster<00:01:31.740> than<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.040> and

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
just that's a bit faster than that and

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.230 
just that's a bit faster than that and
so<00:01:33.659> that's<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.710> first<00:01:34.920> bit<00:01:35.100> put<00:01:35.790> eight<00:01:35.940> eight

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
so that's the first bit put eight eight

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.499 
so that's the first bit put eight eight
bars<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.810> then<00:01:37.590> for<00:01:38.039> the<00:01:38.130> next<00:01:38.280> spirits<00:01:38.759> so

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
bars and then for the next spirits so

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.680 
bars and then for the next spirits so
it's<00:01:39.659> G<00:01:39.899> and<00:01:40.170> then<00:01:40.590> G<00:01:40.830> again<00:01:41.070> for<00:01:41.310> another<00:01:41.430> a

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
it's G and then G again for another a

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.210 
it's G and then G again for another a
when<00:01:42.690> it<00:01:42.810> starts<00:01:43.049> with<00:01:43.140> honor<00:01:43.440> be<00:01:43.770> drunk<00:01:44.070> when

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
when it starts with honor be drunk when

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.100 
when it starts with honor be drunk when
I<00:01:44.280> wake<00:01:44.520> up<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.170> then<00:01:46.580> when<00:01:47.580> it<00:01:47.700> goes<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:48.210> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
I wake up and then when it goes on the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.710 
I wake up and then when it goes on the
right<00:01:49.289> side<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.920> wrong<00:01:50.460> bed<00:01:50.490> when<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.600> goes

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
right side of the wrong bed when it goes

00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:02.040 
right side of the wrong bed when it goes
wrong<00:01:52.020> it's<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.100> D<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:54.050> then<00:01:55.050> e<00:01:55.259> my<00:01:55.440> mom

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.560 

so<00:02:02.680> it's<00:02:02.800> just<00:02:02.890> one<00:02:03.010> strong<00:02:03.520> one<00:02:04.180> strong<00:02:04.540> sit

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
so it's just one strong one strong sit

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.660 
so it's just one strong one strong sit
when<00:02:07.570> a<00:02:07.600> dude<00:02:07.870> drove<00:02:07.960> gonna<00:02:08.380> wake<00:02:08.650> up<00:02:08.890> on<00:02:09.610> the

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
right side of the wrong man to rescue

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:20.910 
right side of the wrong man to rescue
San<00:02:12.730> made<00:02:13.500> okay<00:02:14.500> um<00:02:15.840> I'm<00:02:16.840> in<00:02:17.080> it<00:02:17.430> so<00:02:18.430> it's<00:02:18.780> g8<00:02:19.920> d

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
San made okay um I'm in it so it's g8 d

San made okay um I'm in it so it's g8 d
1<00:02:21.220> e<00:02:22.050> minus<00:02:23.050> 8<00:02:23.380> and<00:02:23.680> then<00:02:24.400> see

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:36.130 

see<00:02:29.120> and<00:02:29.390> then<00:02:29.510> d<00:02:29.720> 448<00:02:33.550> then<00:02:34.550> Jacob<00:02:35.140> so

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
see and then d 448 then Jacob so

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.870 
see and then d 448 then Jacob so
basically

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
basically

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:50.320 
basically
g<00:02:39.640> d<00:02:40.810> minor<00:02:43.090> C<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:44.780> then<00:02:45.440> do<00:02:46.750> okay<00:02:48.880> and<00:02:49.880> then

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
g d minor C and then do okay and then

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.780 
g d minor C and then do okay and then
when<00:02:50.600> it<00:02:50.720> goes<00:02:51.050> to<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:51.650> house<00:02:52.220> gets<00:02:52.490> called

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
when it goes to the house gets called

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.620 
when it goes to the house gets called
when<00:02:52.910> you<00:02:53.090> cut<00:02:53.600> the<00:02:53.720> heating<00:02:55.060> it<00:02:56.060> changes<00:02:56.600> to

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
when you cut the heating it changes to

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:05.610 
when you cut the heating it changes to
us<00:02:56.900> Iman<00:02:57.290> all<00:02:58.450> so<00:02:59.450> it's<00:02:59.630> Jana<00:03:00.260> see

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:12.580 

g<00:03:06.640> so<00:03:07.640> its<00:03:07.820> mana<00:03:08.270> SI<00:03:08.750> d<00:03:10.450> /<00:03:11.450> has<00:03:11.720> this<00:03:11.990> code<00:03:12.320> and

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
g so its mana SI d / has this code and

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.770 
g so its mana SI d / has this code and
for<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.070> strumming<00:03:13.580> I<00:03:13.700> just<00:03:14.030> do<00:03:14.150> down<00:03:14.420> strums

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
for the strumming I just do down strums

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.010 
for the strumming I just do down strums
as<00:03:15.170> like<00:03:15.860> a<00:03:15.890> bird<00:03:16.010> up<00:03:16.340> to<00:03:16.520> the<00:03:16.640> chorus<00:03:17.000> but<00:03:17.450> may
