00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
at this house today learn about an

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.639 
at this house today learn about an
alternative<00:00:33.690> air<00:00:33.870> conditioning<00:00:34.320> system

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
alternative air conditioning system

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.619 
alternative air conditioning system
called<00:00:34.980> high<00:00:35.340> velocity<00:00:35.970> air<00:00:36.090> conditioning

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:36.629 
called high velocity air conditioning

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:38.420 
called high velocity air conditioning
and<00:00:36.870> joined<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.559> Brett<00:00:37.770> Wagner<00:00:38.250> with

and joined this is Brett Wagner with

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.420 
and joined this is Brett Wagner with
Lanco<00:00:39.030> heating<00:00:39.390> cooling<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.019> Brett<00:00:40.590> I'm

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
Lanco heating cooling and and Brett I'm

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.830 
Lanco heating cooling and and Brett I'm
sure<00:00:41.699> a<00:00:41.730> lot<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:41.970> folks<00:00:42.090> haven't<00:00:42.540> heard<00:00:42.750> about

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
sure a lot of folks haven't heard about

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.110 
sure a lot of folks haven't heard about
high<00:00:43.140> velocity<00:00:43.680> air<00:00:43.710> conditioning<00:00:44.280> what<00:00:44.940> is

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
high velocity air conditioning what is

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.439 
high velocity air conditioning what is
it

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:45.449 
it

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:46.910 
it
high<00:00:45.809> blasted<00:00:46.230> air-conditioning<00:00:46.829> is

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
high blasted air-conditioning is

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.340 
high blasted air-conditioning is
basically<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.760> system<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.839> distribute<00:00:49.110> air

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
basically a system to distribute air

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.079 
basically a system to distribute air
throughout<00:00:49.650> the<00:00:49.800> house<00:00:49.949> it's<00:00:50.339> not<00:00:50.850> much

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:51.089 
throughout the house it's not much

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:52.520 
throughout the house it's not much
different<00:00:51.690> as<00:00:51.870> far<00:00:51.900> as<00:00:52.110> your<00:00:52.290> old<00:00:52.409> air

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
different as far as your old air

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.710 
different as far as your old air
handling<00:00:52.769> system<00:00:53.250> except<00:00:53.790> it<00:00:54.360> can<00:00:54.510> deliver

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
handling system except it can deliver

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.540 
handling system except it can deliver
the<00:00:54.900> air<00:00:54.989> more<00:00:55.199> efficiently<00:00:55.680> it's<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.339> little

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
the air more efficiently it's a little

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.979 
the air more efficiently it's a little
more<00:00:56.670> aggressive<00:00:57.120> it'll<00:00:57.360> take<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.570> humidity

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
more aggressive it'll take the humidity

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.380 
more aggressive it'll take the humidity
out<00:00:58.140> even<00:00:58.440> faster<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:59.129> it's<00:00:59.699> easier<00:01:00.089> to<00:01:00.239> run

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
out even faster and it's easier to run

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.910 
out even faster and it's easier to run
in<00:01:00.540> tight<00:01:00.750> spaces<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.470> know<00:01:01.559> we<00:01:01.680> don't<00:01:01.800> have

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
in tight spaces you know we don't have

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.490 
in tight spaces you know we don't have
the<00:01:02.070> big<00:01:02.280> bulky<00:01:02.730> ductwork<00:01:03.269> like<00:01:03.480> we<00:01:03.629> know<00:01:03.960> what

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
the big bulky ductwork like we know what

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.050 
the big bulky ductwork like we know what
this<00:01:04.649> system<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.369> little<00:01:05.550> mini<00:01:05.700> tubes

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
this system you have little mini tubes

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.150 
this system you have little mini tubes
right<00:01:06.360> exactly<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.050> only<00:01:07.170> 2<00:01:07.380> inches<00:01:07.590> big<00:01:07.800> now

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
right exactly it only 2 inches big now

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.340 
right exactly it only 2 inches big now
can<00:01:08.399> it<00:01:08.490> be<00:01:08.640> used<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.300> it<00:01:09.420> more<00:01:09.570> for<00:01:09.810> retrofit

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
can it be used is it more for retrofit

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.440 
can it be used is it more for retrofit
or<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.920> new<00:01:11.039> construction<00:01:11.640> actually<00:01:12.119> it's

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
or is it new construction actually it's

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.690 
or is it new construction actually it's
getting<00:01:12.539> very<00:01:13.470> popular<00:01:13.740> at<00:01:13.979> one<00:01:14.130> point<00:01:14.310> for

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
getting very popular at one point for

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.460 
getting very popular at one point for
retrofit<00:01:15.210> but<00:01:15.750> it's<00:01:15.899> now<00:01:15.990> it's<00:01:16.170> starting<00:01:16.410> to

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
retrofit but it's now it's starting to

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.630 
retrofit but it's now it's starting to
come<00:01:16.590> more<00:01:16.770> play<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.399> the<00:01:17.520> new

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
come more play in the in the new

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.490 
come more play in the in the new
construction<00:01:18.179> also<00:01:18.330> we're<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.050> a<00:01:19.110> house<00:01:19.259> here

that<00:01:19.530> you've<00:01:20.250> got<00:01:20.280> both<00:01:20.670> combinations<00:01:21.360> we're

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
that you've got both combinations we're

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.060 
that you've got both combinations we're
in<00:01:21.570> an<00:01:21.960> older<00:01:22.229> part<00:01:22.440> of<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.619> house<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.950> they've

in an older part of a house and they've
been<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.250> nice<00:01:23.520> addition<00:01:23.700> on<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.060> back<00:01:24.090> side

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
here and is this how they they cooled it

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.430 
here and is this how they they cooled it
originally<00:01:27.659> as<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.810> look<00:01:27.990> up<00:01:28.110> here<00:01:28.289> and<00:01:28.350> see

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
register up there I mean that's what the

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.680 
register up there I mean that's what the
air<00:01:34.140> used<00:01:34.319> to<00:01:34.349> come<00:01:34.530> out<00:01:34.649> of<00:01:34.770> one<00:01:35.399> time<00:01:35.700> but<00:01:36.539> you

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
air used to come out of one time but you

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.940 
air used to come out of one time but you
know<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.810> look<00:01:37.020> at<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.289> old<00:01:37.440> register

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
know you look at this old register

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.380 
know you look at this old register
anyway<00:01:38.459> we'd<00:01:38.700> walk<00:01:38.880> into<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.119> home<00:01:39.270> you

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
anyway we'd walk into a home you

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.330 
anyway we'd walk into a home you
wouldn't<00:01:39.599> think<00:01:39.660> much<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:39.899> it<00:01:40.110> but<00:01:40.890> now<00:01:41.130> when

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
wouldn't think much of it but now when

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.949 
wouldn't think much of it but now when
you<00:01:41.429> walk<00:01:41.580> in<00:01:41.729> this<00:01:41.910> house<00:01:42.179> and<00:01:42.569> you<00:01:42.690> look<00:01:42.869> over

00:01:42.949 --> 00:01:42.959 
you walk in this house and you look over

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:44.960 
you walk in this house and you look over
at<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.289> new<00:01:43.470> register<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.099> you<00:01:44.489> look<00:01:44.670> at<00:01:44.789> you

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
at this new register you you look at you

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.100 
at this new register you you look at you
pretty<00:01:45.119> good<00:01:45.300> saying<00:01:45.539> what<00:01:45.660> is<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:45.989> you

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
pretty good saying what is that you

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.080 
pretty good saying what is that you
hardly<00:01:46.319> even<00:01:46.470> notice<00:01:46.739> it<00:01:47.039> you<00:01:47.190> walk<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.789> it

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
hardly even notice it you walk in and it

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.389 
hardly even notice it you walk in and it
looks<00:01:48.330> like<00:01:48.390> an<00:01:48.750> audio<00:01:49.050> speaker<00:01:49.500> right<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> 2

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
looks like an audio speaker right to a 2

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.100 
looks like an audio speaker right to a 2
inch<00:01:50.580> vent<00:01:50.819> up<00:01:50.970> there<00:01:51.030> that's<00:01:51.509> exactly<00:01:51.959> what

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
inch vent up there that's exactly what

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.050 
inch vent up there that's exactly what
it<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.319> that<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.860> very<00:01:53.520> nice<00:01:53.729> when<00:01:54.000> you

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
it is that is very nice when you

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.300 
it is that is very nice when you
compared<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.539> the<00:01:54.660> old<00:01:54.840> vent<00:01:55.830> that<00:01:56.009> we<00:01:56.099> had

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
compared to the old vent that we had

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.070 
compared to the old vent that we had
here<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.910> then<00:01:57.030> we've<00:01:57.149> got<00:01:57.239> the<00:01:57.420> new<00:01:57.450> portion

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
here and then we've got the new portion

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.210 
here and then we've got the new portion
of<00:01:58.170> house<00:01:58.289> can<00:01:58.470> we<00:01:58.530> take<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.709> look<00:01:58.800> at<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.039> do

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
of house can we take a look at that do

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.339 
of house can we take a look at that do
you<00:01:59.310> bet<00:01:59.429> you<00:01:59.929> Brent<00:02:00.929> we're<00:02:01.050> in<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.200> new

00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:01.349 
you bet you Brent we're in the new

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:02.719 
you bet you Brent we're in the new
edition<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.979> home<00:02:02.160> here<00:02:02.459> in<00:02:02.550> what

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
edition of the home here in what

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.190 
edition of the home here in what
accommodations<00:02:03.360> did<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.599> have<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.869> make<00:02:04.020> to

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
accommodations did you have to make to

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.199 
accommodations did you have to make to
bring<00:02:04.379> the<00:02:04.500> air<00:02:04.590> conditioned<00:02:04.979> into<00:02:05.250> here<00:02:05.489> well

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:06.209 
bring the air conditioned into here well

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:07.430 
bring the air conditioned into here well
actually<00:02:06.330> the<00:02:06.569> accommodations<00:02:07.080> are<00:02:07.170> fairly

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
actually the accommodations are fairly

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.350 
actually the accommodations are fairly
simple<00:02:07.770> because<00:02:08.129> we're<00:02:08.489> going<00:02:08.759> with<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.119> high

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
simple because we're going with the high

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.510 
simple because we're going with the high
velocity<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.869> made<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.229> easy<00:02:10.349> on<00:02:10.619> us<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.979> the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
velocity and made it easy on us and the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.010 
velocity and made it easy on us and the
reason<00:02:11.760> we<00:02:11.849> kind<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.150> came<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.660> decision

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
reason we kind of came to that decision

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.270 
reason we kind of came to that decision
was<00:02:13.349> when<00:02:13.830> we<00:02:13.980> designed<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:15.239> standard<00:02:15.599> duct

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
was when we designed the standard duct

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.010 
was when we designed the standard duct
system<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.400> go<00:02:17.520> in<00:02:17.670> this<00:02:17.849> application<00:02:18.840> we

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
system to go in this application we

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.650 
system to go in this application we
found<00:02:19.379> that<00:02:19.500> it<00:02:19.620> was<00:02:19.739> large<00:02:20.010> fairly<00:02:20.489> bulky<00:02:21.030> we

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
found that it was large fairly bulky we

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.240 
found that it was large fairly bulky we
had<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.840> downstairs<00:02:22.379> level<00:02:22.709> that<00:02:22.920> we<00:02:22.980> needed<00:02:23.160> to

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
had a downstairs level that we needed to

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.390 
had a downstairs level that we needed to
condition<00:02:23.670> also<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.330> by<00:02:25.010> having<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.099> do<00:02:26.220> that

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
condition also and by having to do that

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.130 
condition also and by having to do that
we<00:02:26.519> needed<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:26.819> find<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.269> chase<00:02:27.540> space<00:02:27.840> we<00:02:28.019> had

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
we needed to find a chase space we had

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.780 
we needed to find a chase space we had
to<00:02:28.230> take<00:02:28.379> some<00:02:28.650> of<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:28.800> closet<00:02:29.220> space<00:02:29.459> we<00:02:29.700> had

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
to take some of the closet space we had

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.250 
to take some of the closet space we had
to<00:02:29.879> find<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.180> wall<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.569> get<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.810> this<00:02:31.019> large

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
to find a wall to get the this large

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.410 
to find a wall to get the this large
duct<00:02:31.500> down<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:31.920> through<00:02:32.129> well<00:02:32.640> in<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.330> end

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
duct down and through well in the end

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.020 
duct down and through well in the end
result<00:02:33.780> going<00:02:34.140> with<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.530> high<00:02:34.890> velocity<00:02:35.069> we

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
result going with the high velocity we

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.760 
result going with the high velocity we
had<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.209> truck<00:02:36.540> line<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:36.930> was<00:02:37.050> no<00:02:37.319> larger<00:02:37.500> than

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
had a truck line that was no larger than

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.710 
had a truck line that was no larger than
8<00:02:37.890> inches<00:02:37.920> around<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.730> we<00:02:38.880> were<00:02:38.970> able<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.300> hide

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
8 inches around and we were able to hide

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.880 
8 inches around and we were able to hide
that<00:02:39.750> that's<00:02:40.290> amazing

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
that that's amazing

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.770 
that that's amazing
then<00:02:41.400> tell<00:02:41.730> us<00:02:41.820> about<00:02:41.970> installation<00:02:42.300> how<00:02:42.630> does

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
then tell us about installation how does

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.220 
then tell us about installation how does
that<00:02:42.900> work

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
that work

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.900 
that work
well<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.739> installation<00:02:44.220> process<00:02:44.580> is<00:02:44.610> fairly

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
well the installation process is fairly

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.430 
well the installation process is fairly
simple<00:02:45.239> this<00:02:45.480> is<00:02:45.569> where<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.780> labor<00:02:45.989> savings

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
simple this is where the labor savings

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.170 
simple this is where the labor savings
actually<00:02:46.620> kind<00:02:46.980> of<00:02:47.010> comes<00:02:47.250> in<00:02:47.489> in<00:02:47.670> this

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
actually kind of comes in in this

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.750 
actually kind of comes in in this
situation<00:02:48.780> if<00:02:48.930> we<00:02:49.230> have<00:02:49.560> natives<00:02:50.430> trunkline

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
situation if we have natives trunkline

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.640 
situation if we have natives trunkline
running<00:02:51.060> within<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.420> Attic<00:02:51.750> we<00:02:52.470> have<00:02:52.560> this

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
running within the Attic we have this

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.949 
running within the Attic we have this
thing<00:02:52.860> which<00:02:53.310> we<00:02:53.459> call<00:02:53.610> our<00:02:53.640> take<00:02:53.940> off<00:02:54.180> and<00:02:54.510> we

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
thing which we call our take off and we

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.390 
thing which we call our take off and we
take<00:02:55.200> this<00:02:55.319> take<00:02:55.530> off<00:02:55.739> and<00:02:55.950> it's<00:02:56.040> mounted<00:02:56.370> to

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
conditioned air within the pipe we run

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.850 
conditioned air within the pipe we run
it<00:03:11.130> over<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.819> the<00:03:11.940> diffuser<00:03:12.360> and<00:03:12.629> hook<00:03:13.590> it<00:03:13.709> up

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
it over to the diffuser and hook it up

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.570 
it over to the diffuser and hook it up
now<00:03:15.349> there's<00:03:16.349> a<00:03:16.440> rule<00:03:16.650> at<00:03:16.799> this<00:03:16.980> we<00:03:17.549> have

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
now there's a rule at this we have

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.600 
now there's a rule at this we have
10-foot<00:03:18.330> and<00:03:18.480> minimum<00:03:18.870> of<00:03:19.019> a<00:03:19.920> run<00:03:20.130> length<00:03:20.370> and

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
10-foot and minimum of a run length and

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:21.740 
10-foot and minimum of a run length and
the<00:03:20.700> reason<00:03:20.940> we<00:03:21.030> do<00:03:21.120> that<00:03:21.150> as<00:03:21.390> for<00:03:21.540> sound

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
the reason we do that as for sound

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.300 
the reason we do that as for sound
continuation<00:03:22.410> because<00:03:22.620> we<00:03:22.739> want<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.010> system

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
continuation because we want the system

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
biggest enemy is is humidity if we had a

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.350 
biggest enemy is is humidity if we had a
76<00:04:22.590> degree<00:04:22.889> house<00:04:23.160> it<00:04:23.460> had<00:04:23.580> a<00:04:23.610> high<00:04:23.910> humidity

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
76 degree house it had a high humidity

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.420 
76 degree house it had a high humidity
levels<00:04:24.900> it<00:04:24.990> doesn't<00:04:25.260> feel<00:04:25.350> comfortable<00:04:25.889> but<00:04:26.400> a

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
levels it doesn't feel comfortable but a

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.029 
levels it doesn't feel comfortable but a
76<00:04:27.120> degree<00:04:27.479> home<00:04:28.200> with<00:04:28.440> a<00:04:28.470> low<00:04:28.800> humidity

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
76 degree home with a low humidity

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:31.100 
76 degree home with a low humidity
values<00:04:29.460> it<00:04:29.910> feels<00:04:30.150> very<00:04:30.270> comfortable<00:04:30.630> and

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
values it feels very comfortable and

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.390 
values it feels very comfortable and
that's<00:04:31.289> where<00:04:31.440> we<00:04:31.560> save<00:04:31.740> our<00:04:31.860> money<00:04:31.979> that's

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
that's where we save our money that's

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.990 
that's where we save our money that's
terrific

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
terrific

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.879 
terrific
talk<00:04:33.660> about<00:04:33.780> saving<00:04:34.169> money<00:04:34.289> then<00:04:34.590> I'm<00:04:34.860> sure

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
talk about saving money then I'm sure

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.550 
talk about saving money then I'm sure
the<00:04:35.310> question<00:04:35.669> is<00:04:35.820> what<00:04:36.000> about<00:04:36.090> cost<00:04:36.479> cost<00:04:37.260> you

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
the question is what about cost cost you

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.260 
the question is what about cost cost you
know<00:04:37.650> it's<00:04:37.800> basically<00:04:38.220> a<00:04:38.250> wash<00:04:38.610> although<00:04:39.060> it's

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
know it's basically a wash although it's

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.290 
know it's basically a wash although it's
less<00:04:39.780> labor-intensive<00:04:40.220> it<00:04:41.220> still<00:04:41.520> costs<00:04:42.030> a

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
less labor-intensive it still costs a

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.210 
less labor-intensive it still costs a
little<00:04:42.810> bit<00:04:42.930> more<00:04:43.050> for<00:04:43.620> the<00:04:43.680> equipment<00:04:43.979> that's

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
little bit more for the equipment that's

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.070 
little bit more for the equipment that's
involved<00:04:44.550> with<00:04:44.700> this<00:04:44.970> high<00:04:45.419> velocity<00:04:45.479> air

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
involved with this high velocity air

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.270 
involved with this high velocity air
conditioning<00:04:46.500> I'm<00:04:46.560> sure<00:04:46.740> it's<00:04:46.889> one<00:04:47.070> thing

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
conditioning I'm sure it's one thing

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.740 
conditioning I'm sure it's one thing
