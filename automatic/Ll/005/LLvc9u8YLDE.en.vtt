00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
brings the price a little closer but I

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.990 
brings the price a little closer but I
think<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.530> if<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:17.310> are<00:01:17.340> consuming<00:01:17.909> you

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
think that if you are consuming you

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.890 
think that if you are consuming you
really<00:01:18.180> don't<00:01:18.360> care<00:01:18.570> about<00:01:18.689> the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
really don't care about the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.240 
really don't care about the
functionality<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.680> Microsoft<00:01:20.159> Kinect

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
functionality of the Microsoft Kinect

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.859 
functionality of the Microsoft Kinect
you<00:01:20.700> don't<00:01:20.880> see<00:01:20.970> yourself<00:01:21.090> talking<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.720> your

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
you don't see yourself talking to your

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:22.969 
you don't see yourself talking to your
TV<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.229> things<00:01:22.409> like<00:01:22.590> that

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
TV and things like that

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.260 
TV and things like that
now<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.340> 100<00:01:23.640> dollar<00:01:23.790> difference<00:01:23.939> is<00:01:24.150> going

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
now this 100 dollar difference is going

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.940 
now this 100 dollar difference is going
to<00:01:24.330> be<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.420> really<00:01:25.020> really<00:01:25.110> big<00:01:25.380> deal<00:01:25.560> for<00:01:25.590> you

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
to be a really really big deal for you

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.410 
to be a really really big deal for you
now<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.460> next<00:01:26.670> thing<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:26.880> probably<00:01:27.030> not<00:01:27.270> as

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
now the next thing is probably not as

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.179 
now the next thing is probably not as
big<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.659> deal<00:01:27.840> as<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.259> other<00:01:28.439> ones<00:01:28.680> but<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:29.070> is

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
big a deal as the other ones but it is

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.920 
big a deal as the other ones but it is
to<00:01:29.340> design<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.909> PlayStation<00:01:30.479> 4<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.810> is

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
to design the PlayStation 4 it is

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.950 
to design the PlayStation 4 it is
smaller<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.829> slimmer<00:01:32.189> than<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.640> Xbox<00:01:33.450> one<00:01:33.780> I

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
smaller and slimmer than the Xbox one I

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.109 
smaller and slimmer than the Xbox one I
mean<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.320> Xbox<00:01:34.710> one<00:01:34.890> looks<00:01:35.189> massive<00:01:35.729> looks

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
mean the Xbox one looks massive looks

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.399 
mean the Xbox one looks massive looks
like<00:01:36.240> it's<00:01:36.329> going<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.479> take<00:01:36.570> up<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.840> lot<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.110> room

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
like it's going to take up a lot of room

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.140 
like it's going to take up a lot of room
on<00:01:37.590> your<00:01:37.950> entertainment<00:01:38.400> stand<00:01:38.759> what

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
on your entertainment stand what

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.219 
on your entertainment stand what
replaces<00:01:39.509> support<00:01:39.780> just<00:01:39.900> seems<00:01:40.049> like<00:01:40.140> a

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
replaces support just seems like a

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.719 
replaces support just seems like a
smaller<00:01:40.560> version<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.070> Xbox<00:01:41.250> want<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.640> be

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
smaller version of the Xbox want to be

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:42.800 
smaller version of the Xbox want to be
honest<00:01:42.000> with<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.210> they<00:01:42.299> both<00:01:42.420> have<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.780> same

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
honest with you they both have the same

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.080 
honest with you they both have the same
type<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.470> two-tone<00:01:43.950> design<00:01:43.979> but<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.939> may

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
type of two-tone design but that may

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.730 
type of two-tone design but that may
play<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.329> part<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:45.659> people's<00:01:45.930> mind<00:01:46.200> but<00:01:46.560> one

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
play a part in people's mind but one

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.139 
play a part in people's mind but one
thing<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.040> Sony<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.490> keeping<00:01:47.939> with<00:01:48.060> the

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
thing that Sony is keeping with the

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.340 
thing that Sony is keeping with the
design<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.659> they<00:01:48.750> kept<00:01:48.990> with<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
design that they kept with the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.170 
design that they kept with the
PlayStation<00:01:49.920> 3<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.369> hard<00:01:50.700> drive<00:01:50.970> is

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
PlayStation 3 is that the hard drive is

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.569 
PlayStation 3 is that the hard drive is
removable<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.380> Xbox<00:01:52.740> one's<00:01:52.979> hard<00:01:53.189> drive<00:01:53.430> is

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
removable the Xbox one's hard drive is

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.819 
removable the Xbox one's hard drive is
not<00:01:53.610> removable<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:54.479> hard<00:01:54.899> drives<00:01:55.200> do<00:01:55.470> crash

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
not removable so hard drives do crash

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.010 
not removable so hard drives do crash
and<00:01:56.070> they<00:01:56.130> do<00:01:56.189> fail<00:01:56.520> all<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.969> time<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.840> one

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
and they do fail all the time so the one

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.420 
and they do fail all the time so the one
if<00:01:58.140> your<00:01:58.290> hard<00:01:58.469> drive<00:01:58.530> crashes<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.100> Xbox

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
if your hard drive crashes in the Xbox

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.039 
if your hard drive crashes in the Xbox
one<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.640> probably<00:01:59.909> have<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.299> send<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.600> out<00:02:00.719> to

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
one you probably have to send it out to

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.330 
one you probably have to send it out to
get<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.229> repaired<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.770> may<00:02:01.860> even<00:02:02.159> cost

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
get it repaired and that may even cost

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.010 
get it repaired and that may even cost
you<00:02:02.460> more<00:02:02.610> money<00:02:02.820> where<00:02:03.540> this<00:02:03.630> one<00:02:03.810> in<00:02:03.899> one

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
you more money where this one in one

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.149 
you more money where this one in one
you'll<00:02:04.170> be<00:02:04.200> able<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.469> replace<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.950> hard

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
you'll be able to replace that a hard

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:05.760 
you'll be able to replace that a hard
job<00:02:05.369> and

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
job and

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.260 
job and
even<00:02:06.009> upgrade<00:02:06.399> their<00:02:06.579> hard<00:02:06.789> drive<00:02:07.030> in<00:02:07.240> the

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
even upgrade their hard drive in the

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.119 
even upgrade their hard drive in the
future<00:02:07.689> and<00:02:07.899> that's<00:02:08.140> definitely<00:02:08.440> a<00:02:08.679> plus

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 
future and that's definitely a plus

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:10.740 
future and that's definitely a plus
I<00:02:09.160> think<00:02:09.700> these<00:02:09.789> next<00:02:10.030> three<00:02:10.239> things<00:02:10.450> really

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
I think these next three things really

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.930 
I think these next three things really
gave<00:02:10.929> Sony<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.440> advantage<00:02:12.040> over<00:02:12.250> Microsoft

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
gave Sony the advantage over Microsoft

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.460 
gave Sony the advantage over Microsoft
when<00:02:13.030> it<00:02:13.120> comes<00:02:13.300> to<00:02:13.420> these<00:02:13.510> nitrogen<00:02:13.959> consoles

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
when it comes to these nitrogen consoles

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.290 
when it comes to these nitrogen consoles
buy<00:02:14.769> the<00:02:14.830> first<00:02:15.040> one<00:02:15.129> the<00:02:15.610> PlayStation<00:02:16.120> 4<00:02:16.150> is

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
buy the first one the PlayStation 4 is

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.390 
buy the first one the PlayStation 4 is
gonna<00:02:16.629> be<00:02:16.780> region<00:02:17.200> free<00:02:17.410> so<00:02:17.709> you<00:02:18.040> can<00:02:18.069> play

game titles from other different places

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:20.940 
game titles from other different places
you<00:02:20.170> don't<00:02:20.230> have<00:02:20.379> to<00:02:20.440> worry<00:02:20.590> about<00:02:20.680> any

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
you don't have to worry about any

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.380 
you don't have to worry about any
restrictions<00:02:21.550> or<00:02:21.580> anything<00:02:21.790> like<00:02:21.970> that<00:02:22.030> and

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
restrictions or anything like that and

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.869 
restrictions or anything like that and
then<00:02:22.840> -<00:02:23.140> is<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.860> one<00:02:24.160> thing<00:02:24.370> that<00:02:24.430> Microsoft

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
then - is the one thing that Microsoft

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.910 
then - is the one thing that Microsoft
really<00:02:25.450> took<00:02:25.569> a<00:02:25.690> lot<00:02:25.840> of<00:02:25.870> flack<00:02:26.140> for<00:02:26.379> it's<00:02:26.799> the

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
really took a lot of flack for it's the

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.410 
really took a lot of flack for it's the
fact<00:02:27.160> that<00:02:27.250> that's<00:02:27.760> owned<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.090> place<00:02:28.180> before

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
fact that that's owned the place before

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.059 
fact that that's owned the place before
it's<00:02:28.660> not<00:02:28.720> gonna<00:02:28.870> have<00:02:29.080> to<00:02:29.200> be<00:02:29.349> connected<00:02:30.040> to

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
it's not gonna have to be connected to

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.410 
it's not gonna have to be connected to
the<00:02:30.250> Internet<00:02:30.519> for<00:02:30.549> you<00:02:30.819> to<00:02:30.970> play

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
the Internet for you to play

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.059 
the Internet for you to play

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
and so the Microsoft one if you didn't

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.559 
and so the Microsoft one if you didn't
know<00:02:33.190> you<00:02:33.250> have<00:02:33.519> to<00:02:33.640> check<00:02:33.910> in<00:02:34.090> what<00:02:34.450> your

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
know you have to check in what your

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.750 
know you have to check in what your
system<00:02:34.900> will<00:02:35.019> check<00:02:35.260> in<00:02:35.440> every<00:02:35.739> 24<00:02:36.220> hours<00:02:36.250> via

just<00:03:48.040> sharing<00:03:48.310> and<00:03:48.610> trading<00:03:49.000> with<00:03:49.090> your

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
just sharing and trading with your

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.310 
just sharing and trading with your

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
friends and things like that which is

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.860 
friends and things like that which is
perfectly<00:03:50.950> fine<00:03:51.580> and<00:03:51.850> it<00:03:52.000> should<00:03:52.240> be<00:03:52.390> fine<00:03:52.630> and

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
perfectly fine and it should be fine and

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.510 
perfectly fine and it should be fine and
I<00:03:53.110> think<00:03:53.140> the<00:03:53.350> Sony<00:03:53.590> is<00:03:53.770> winning<00:03:54.070> the<00:03:54.160> hearts

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
I think the Sony is winning the hearts

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.920 
I think the Sony is winning the hearts
of<00:03:54.610> the<00:03:54.730> consumers<00:03:55.150> where<00:03:55.330> Microsoft<00:03:55.780> is

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
of the consumers where Microsoft is

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.450 
of the consumers where Microsoft is
trying<00:03:55.960> to<00:03:56.200> win<00:03:56.350> the<00:03:56.500> pockets<00:03:56.950> of<00:03:57.070> the

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
trying to win the pockets of the

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.680 
trying to win the pockets of the
consumer<00:03:57.910> and<00:03:58.060> so<00:03:58.210> I<00:03:58.240> think<00:03:58.390> really

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
consumer and so I think really

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.860 
consumer and so I think really
everything<00:03:59.500> boils<00:03:59.740> down<00:04:00.010> to<00:04:00.690> Microsoft<00:04:01.690> is

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
everything boils down to Microsoft is

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.210 
everything boils down to Microsoft is
really<00:04:02.140> trying<00:04:02.320> to<00:04:02.440> be<00:04:02.530> your<00:04:02.680> parents<00:04:03.100> they're

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
really trying to be your parents they're

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.800 
really trying to be your parents they're
trying<00:04:03.430> to<00:04:03.460> be<00:04:03.640> here<00:04:03.940> your<00:04:04.180> daddy<00:04:04.450> and<00:04:04.630> your

trying to be here your daddy and your

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
companies need to start realizing that

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.570 
companies need to start realizing that
most<00:04:35.560> consumers<00:04:35.830> aren't<00:04:36.160> going<00:04:36.310> to<00:04:36.370> be<00:04:36.430> doing

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
most consumers aren't going to be doing

most consumers aren't going to be doing
anything<00:04:36.910> illegal<00:04:37.270> with<00:04:37.450> the<00:04:37.630> system<00:04:37.960> so

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
anything illegal with the system so

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.860 
anything illegal with the system so
don't<00:04:38.290> punish<00:04:38.560> the<00:04:39.280> majority<00:04:40.150> and<00:04:40.419> when<00:04:40.750> you

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
don't punish the majority and when you

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.600 
don't punish the majority and when you
really<00:04:41.110> try<00:04:41.260> to<00:04:41.290> just<00:04:41.440> punish<00:04:41.890> the<00:04:42.070> few<00:04:42.370> so

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
really try to just punish the few so

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.430 
really try to just punish the few so
that's<00:04:43.090> my<00:04:43.270> two<00:04:43.330> cents<00:04:43.750> and<00:04:43.900> this<00:04:44.080> is<00:04:44.260> why<00:04:44.410> I

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
that's my two cents and this is why I

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.800 
that's my two cents and this is why I
think<00:04:44.560> the<00:04:44.800> PlayStation<00:04:45.340> 4<00:04:45.550> is<00:04:45.760> winning<00:04:46.600> over

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
think the PlayStation 4 is winning over

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.840 
think the PlayStation 4 is winning over
the<00:04:46.840> Xbox<00:04:47.260> one<00:04:47.470> in<00:04:47.680> the<00:04:47.770> minds<00:04:48.070> and<00:04:48.340> hearts<00:04:48.400> a

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
the Xbox one in the minds and hearts a

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.760 
the Xbox one in the minds and hearts a
lot<00:04:49.300> of<00:04:49.419> consumers<00:04:49.840> right<00:04:50.020> now<00:04:50.200> but<00:04:50.590> again

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
lot of consumers right now but again

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:51.750 
lot of consumers right now but again
ultimately<00:04:50.919> it's<00:04:51.250> gonna<00:04:51.400> come<00:04:51.520> to<00:04:51.640> your

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
ultimately it's gonna come to your

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.100 
ultimately it's gonna come to your
personal<00:04:52.060> opinion<00:04:52.390> about<00:04:52.419> which<00:04:52.690> games<00:04:52.900> you
