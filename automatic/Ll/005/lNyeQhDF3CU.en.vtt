 also appears very much this problem is 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:22.529
 blocked a horrible scene 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.560
 this is due to the intel chip that with the 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.750
 time administrators of it remotely 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.750
 blocks to that state that the person 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.399

 the bios battery of the notebook does not 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.829
 battery only controls time and 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.020
