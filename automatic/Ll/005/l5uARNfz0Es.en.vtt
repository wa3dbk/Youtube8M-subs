into<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.440> sayings<00:00:49.770> here<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.070> can<00:00:50.219> see<00:00:50.370> what

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
into the sayings here you can see what

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.580 
into the sayings here you can see what
I've<00:00:50.640> changed<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.329> prevents<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.840> home<00:00:52.020> screen<00:00:52.410> I

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
I've changed so prevents a home screen I

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.490 
I've changed so prevents a home screen I
change<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.280> portrait<00:00:53.730> good<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.390> six<00:00:54.899> by<00:00:55.050> six<00:00:55.110> I

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
change the portrait good to six by six I

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.500 
change the portrait good to six by six I
think<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.710> default<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.219> four<00:00:56.430> by<00:00:56.579> four<00:00:56.879> but

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
think the default is four by four but

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.330 
think the default is four by four but
six<00:00:57.719> by<00:00:57.930> six<00:00:57.989> allows<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.680> have<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.800> few<00:00:59.219> more

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
six by six allows you to have a few more

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.680 
six by six allows you to have a few more
icons<00:00:59.699> on<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.850> screen<00:00:59.940> than<00:01:00.270> normal<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.600> can

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
icons on the screen than normal you can

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.569 
icons on the screen than normal you can
make<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.109> seven<00:01:01.410> by<00:01:01.500> seven<00:01:01.530> but<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.190> don't<00:01:02.489> know

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
make it seven by seven but I don't know

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.880 
make it seven by seven but I don't know
just<00:01:02.699> like<00:01:02.879> six<00:01:03.120> by<00:01:03.239> six<00:01:03.379> landscape<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.530> 10<00:01:04.739> by

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
just like six by six landscape is 10 by

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.140 
just like six by six landscape is 10 by
10<00:01:05.100> again<00:01:05.159> I've<00:01:05.489> made<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.820> quite<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.060> lot

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
10 again I've made that quite a lot

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.570 
10 again I've made that quite a lot
bigger<00:01:06.450> but<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:07.020> don't<00:01:07.650> actually<00:01:08.130> use<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.369> in

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
bigger but I don't actually use it in

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.310 
bigger but I don't actually use it in
landscape<00:01:08.729> mode<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.330> it's<00:01:09.450> pretty<00:01:09.540> useless<00:01:09.960> in

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
landscape mode so it's pretty useless in

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.620 
landscape mode so it's pretty useless in
terms<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.860> icon<00:01:11.280> size<00:01:11.520> it's<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.420> hundred

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
terms of icon size it's a hundred

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.060 
terms of icon size it's a hundred
percent<00:01:12.750> pretty<00:01:13.229> standard<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.710> can<00:01:13.830> make<00:01:13.950> it

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
percent pretty standard you can make it

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.590 
percent pretty standard you can make it
smaller<00:01:14.159> or<00:01:14.430> bigger<00:01:14.640> by<00:01:14.909> dragging<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.360> up

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
smaller or bigger by dragging that up

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.109 
smaller or bigger by dragging that up
and<00:01:15.840> or<00:01:16.020> down<00:01:16.259> manage<00:01:17.250> screens<00:01:17.640> this<00:01:17.850> allows

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 
use but not all the time sometimes I

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.120 
use but not all the time sometimes I
have<00:05:44.750> a<00:05:44.780> widget<00:05:45.170> in<00:05:45.260> here<00:05:45.470> but<00:05:45.710> right<00:05:45.950> now<00:05:46.100> i

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
have a widget in here but right now i

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.480 
have a widget in here but right now i
don't<00:05:47.050> in<00:05:48.050> terms<00:05:48.590> of<00:05:48.710> my<00:05:48.830> notifications

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
don't in terms of my notifications

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.890 
don't in terms of my notifications
that's<00:05:49.640> a<00:05:49.700> strike<00:05:49.940> these<00:05:50.120> down<00:05:50.330> everyone

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
that's a strike these down everyone

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.210 
that's a strike these down everyone
always<00:05:51.050> asked<00:05:51.380> me<00:05:51.500> what<00:05:51.710> this<00:05:51.860> notification

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
always asked me what this notification

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.520 
always asked me what this notification
is<00:05:52.550> right<00:05:52.730> here<00:05:52.940> and<00:05:53.120> it's<00:05:53.240> lux<00:05:53.570> now<00:05:54.290> i

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:54.530 
is right here and it's lux now i

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.440 
is right here and it's lux now i
actually<00:05:54.920> use<00:05:55.100> the<00:05:55.280> automatic<00:05:55.970> brightness

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.450 
actually use the automatic brightness

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.960 
actually use the automatic brightness
the<00:05:57.260> default<00:05:57.860> ematic<00:05:58.340> brightness<00:05:58.700> settings

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
the default ematic brightness settings

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.150 
the default ematic brightness settings
for<00:05:59.150> lux<00:05:59.330> but<00:06:00.290> it's<00:06:00.410> really<00:06:00.590> awesome<00:06:00.800> and<00:06:01.040> the

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 
for lux but it's really awesome and the

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.770 
for lux but it's really awesome and the
reason<00:06:01.460> is<00:06:01.580> if<00:06:01.730> i<00:06:01.820> just<00:06:02.000> go<00:06:02.120> into<00:06:02.360> the<00:06:02.480> actual

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 
reason is if i just go into the actual

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.440 
reason is if i just go into the actual
settings<00:06:03.470> right<00:06:03.650> here<00:06:03.680> we<00:06:04.550> can<00:06:04.700> see<00:06:04.970> what<00:06:05.360> it

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:05.450 
settings right here we can see what it

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.510 
settings right here we can see what it
allows<00:06:05.660> you<00:06:05.870> to<00:06:05.990> do<00:06:06.170> now<00:06:06.410> why<00:06:06.800> I<00:06:06.830> actually<00:06:07.190> like

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
allows you to do now why I actually like

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.350 
allows you to do now why I actually like
Lux<00:06:07.940> is<00:06:08.150> because<00:06:08.510> I<00:06:09.400> have<00:06:10.400> this<00:06:10.610> option<00:06:10.790> open

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
Lux is because I have this option open

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.360 
Lux is because I have this option open
right<00:06:11.540> here<00:06:11.570> adjust<00:06:12.200> on<00:06:12.440> wake<00:06:12.650> only<00:06:12.920> so<00:06:13.250> it

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
right here adjust on wake only so it

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.920 
right here adjust on wake only so it
only<00:06:13.490> changes<00:06:13.820> my<00:06:14.090> brightness<00:06:14.360> when<00:06:14.660> I<00:06:14.690> turn

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
only changes my brightness when I turn

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.870 
only changes my brightness when I turn
the<00:06:15.050> screen<00:06:15.290> on<00:06:15.440> then<00:06:15.980> it<00:06:16.130> doesn't<00:06:16.310> adjust<00:06:16.670> it

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
the screen on then it doesn't adjust it

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.820 
the screen on then it doesn't adjust it
anymore<00:06:17.300> so<00:06:17.690> it<00:06:17.930> kind<00:06:18.110> of<00:06:18.170> saves<00:06:18.440> a<00:06:18.650> lot<00:06:18.770> of

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
anymore so it kind of saves a lot of

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.860 
anymore so it kind of saves a lot of
battery<00:06:19.070> but<00:06:19.430> it<00:06:19.580> still<00:06:19.880> works<00:06:20.120> as<00:06:20.420> well<00:06:20.480> as

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870 
battery but it still works as well as

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.140 
battery but it still works as well as
automatic<00:06:21.530> brightness<00:06:21.710> so<00:06:22.160> that's<00:06:22.820> kind<00:06:23.090> of

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
automatic brightness so that's kind of

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.270 
automatic brightness so that's kind of
cool<00:06:23.360> it's<00:06:24.140> definitely<00:06:24.560> worth<00:06:24.680> trying<00:06:24.890> out<00:06:25.160> if

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 
cool it's definitely worth trying out if

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.650 
cool it's definitely worth trying out if
you<00:06:25.400> haven't<00:06:25.670> tried<00:06:25.730> out<00:06:25.940> lots<00:06:26.150> from<00:06:26.420> just

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:26.660 
you haven't tried out lots from just

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:27.700 
you haven't tried out lots from just
going<00:06:26.720> to<00:06:26.840> turn<00:06:26.960> this<00:06:27.110> down<00:06:27.290> a<00:06:27.350> bit<00:06:27.560> because

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 
going to turn this down a bit because

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.430 
going to turn this down a bit because
makes<00:06:28.430> it<00:06:28.550> easier<00:06:28.850> to<00:06:28.880> see<00:06:29.060> for<00:06:29.240> my<00:06:29.300> camera<00:06:29.690> but

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 
makes it easier to see for my camera but

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.770 
makes it easier to see for my camera but
so<00:06:30.590> that's<00:06:30.830> Lux<00:06:31.160> this<00:06:31.490> other<00:06:31.700> widget<00:06:32.090> or<00:06:32.270> this

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:32.780 
so that's Lux this other widget or this

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.450 
so that's Lux this other widget or this
other<00:06:32.930> notification<00:06:33.680> right<00:06:33.800> here<00:06:34.010> the<00:06:34.130> top<00:06:34.310> is

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
other notification right here the top is

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.540 
other notification right here the top is
system<00:06:34.820> to<00:06:35.030> know<00:06:35.180> just<00:06:35.390> shows<00:06:35.540> me<00:06:35.570> my<00:06:35.810> cpu

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.550 
system to know just shows me my cpu

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.710 
system to know just shows me my cpu
temperature<00:06:37.550> right<00:06:37.880> now<00:06:38.030> it's<00:06:38.180> at<00:06:38.270> 31<00:06:38.690> degrees

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 
temperature right now it's at 31 degrees

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.300 
temperature right now it's at 31 degrees
which<00:06:39.169> is<00:06:39.320> actually<00:06:39.470> pretty<00:06:39.740> decent<00:06:39.919> for<00:06:40.190> a

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.310 
which is actually pretty decent for a

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.230 
which is actually pretty decent for a
CPU<00:06:40.669> temperature<00:06:40.850> you

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240
