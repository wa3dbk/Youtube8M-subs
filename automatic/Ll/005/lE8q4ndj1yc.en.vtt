00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
put this on half of my face to cover my

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.899 
put this on half of my face to cover my
poor<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.840> also<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.470> primer<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.729> it's

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
poor and this is also a primer so it's

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.179 
poor and this is also a primer so it's
good<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.150> use<00:01:18.650> to<00:01:19.650> just<00:01:20.100> prime<00:01:20.880> your<00:01:20.909> face<00:01:21.479> and

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
good to use to just prime your face and

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.130 
good to use to just prime your face and
I<00:01:23.189> don't<00:01:23.220> find<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.150> leaves<00:01:24.270> my<00:01:24.509> skin<00:01:24.570> oily

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
I don't find that it leaves my skin oily

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.090 
I don't find that it leaves my skin oily
because<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.470> do<00:01:25.530> have<00:01:25.710> pretty<00:01:26.700> oily<00:01:27.270> skin<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.320> I

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
because I do have pretty oily skin and I

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.920 
because I do have pretty oily skin and I
don't<00:01:29.340> think<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.759> adds<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.329> or<00:01:30.659> anything

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
don't think it adds to that or anything

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.990 
don't think it adds to that or anything
so<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.290> think<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.619> does<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.829> good<00:01:32.130> job<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.430> priming

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
so I think it does a good job of priming

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.060 
so I think it does a good job of priming
my<00:01:33.030> face<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.290> side<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.500> my<00:01:34.619> face<00:01:34.799> that

have<00:01:49.530> some<00:01:49.890> visible<00:01:50.369> pores<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.450> do<00:01:51.509> not

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
like that so I'm going to be seeing if

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.130 
like that so I'm going to be seeing if
this<00:01:54.649> new<00:01:55.649> baby<00:01:56.040> skin<00:01:56.490> works<00:01:57.060> just<00:01:57.689> as<00:01:57.840> well<00:01:57.899> as

the Porefessional to cover that up so
the<00:02:00.329> first<00:02:00.450> noticeable<00:02:00.960> difference<00:02:01.500> is<00:02:01.740> the

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
the first noticeable difference is the

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.830 
the first noticeable difference is the
Porefessional<00:02:02.729> does<00:02:02.909> have<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.119> bit<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.630> tint

Porefessional does have a bit of a tint
to<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.350> doesn't<00:02:04.619> feel<00:02:04.740> like<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.979> gel<00:02:05.250> at

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430

slicker<00:02:56.290> than<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.590> professional<00:02:58.459> and<00:02:58.700> the

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
slicker than the professional and the

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.259 
slicker than the professional and the
texture<00:03:00.560> I<00:03:00.920> know<00:03:01.370> I<00:03:01.580> can<00:03:01.790> live<00:03:01.970> with<00:03:02.120> the

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
texture I know I can live with the

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:03.910 
texture I know I can live with the
texture<00:03:02.570> as<00:03:02.840> long<00:03:03.019> as<00:03:03.170> it's<00:03:03.320> doing<00:03:03.560> what<00:03:03.800> it

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
texture as long as it's doing what it

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.300 
texture as long as it's doing what it
needs<00:03:03.980> to<00:03:04.220> do<00:03:04.400> so<00:03:05.120> i<00:03:05.150> would<00:03:05.480> say<00:03:05.750> that<00:03:05.959> i<00:03:06.709> am<00:03:07.190> a

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
needs to do so i would say that i am a

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.699 
needs to do so i would say that i am a
huge<00:03:08.000> fan<00:03:08.269> of<00:03:08.300> the<00:03:08.450> professional<00:03:09.019> and<00:03:09.230> i<00:03:09.500> think

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
huge fan of the professional and i think

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.290 
huge fan of the professional and i think
this<00:03:09.800> is<00:03:09.950> a<00:03:09.980> close<00:03:10.220> runner-up<00:03:10.580> this<00:03:10.970> one<00:03:11.150> is

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
this is a close runner-up this one is

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.690 
this is a close runner-up this one is
you<00:03:12.019> know<00:03:12.140> obviously<00:03:12.410> a<00:03:12.769> lot<00:03:12.980> less<00:03:13.670> expensive

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
you know obviously a lot less expensive

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.630 
you know obviously a lot less expensive
and<00:03:14.450> i<00:03:15.019> think<00:03:15.560> they<00:03:15.650> do<00:03:15.709> pretty<00:03:16.010> much<00:03:16.130> the<00:03:16.280> same

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
and i think they do pretty much the same

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.690 
and i think they do pretty much the same
thing<00:03:16.940> but<00:03:16.970> um<00:03:17.450> this<00:03:18.019> one<00:03:18.290> I'm<00:03:18.769> not<00:03:19.220> as<00:03:19.430> much<00:03:19.489> of

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
thing but um this one I'm not as much of

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.180 
thing but um this one I'm not as much of
a<00:03:19.910> fan<00:03:20.120> of<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.390> consistency<00:03:21.079> but<00:03:21.320> we<00:03:21.680> will<00:03:21.980> see

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
a fan of the consistency but we will see

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.740 
a fan of the consistency but we will see
how<00:03:22.340> it<00:03:22.430> holds<00:03:22.549> up<00:03:22.670> with<00:03:22.820> my<00:03:22.970> ola<00:03:23.269> skin<00:03:23.540> and

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
how it holds up with my ola skin and

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.830 
how it holds up with my ola skin and
this<00:03:24.530> one<00:03:24.709> you<00:03:24.890> know<00:03:24.980> I'm<00:03:25.130> just<00:03:25.160> it's<00:03:26.000> amazing

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
this one you know I'm just it's amazing

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.930 
this one you know I'm just it's amazing
i've<00:03:27.140> been<00:03:27.260> using<00:03:27.410> it<00:03:27.620> and<00:03:27.950> i<00:03:28.579> think<00:03:28.610> they're

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
i've been using it and i think they're

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.550 
i've been using it and i think they're
pretty<00:03:29.269> close<00:03:29.450> to<00:03:29.690> each<00:03:29.810> other<00:03:29.900> this<00:03:30.350> one<00:03:30.530> just

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
pretty close to each other this one just

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.220 
pretty close to each other this one just
has<00:03:31.070> a<00:03:31.100> little<00:03:31.459> bit<00:03:31.670> of<00:03:31.730> difference<00:03:31.970> so<00:03:32.570> I'm

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
has a little bit of difference so I'm

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.310 
has a little bit of difference so I'm
gonna<00:03:33.440> try<00:03:33.860> this<00:03:34.760> and<00:03:35.600> see<00:03:35.660> if<00:03:35.870> you<00:03:35.959> like<00:03:36.140> how

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
gonna try this and see if you like how

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.250 
gonna try this and see if you like how
it<00:03:36.350> works<00:03:37.390> because<00:03:38.390> you<00:03:38.750> know<00:03:38.870> they<00:03:38.989> basically

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
it works because you know they basically

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.890 
it works because you know they basically
did<00:03:39.470> the<00:03:39.530> same<00:03:39.769> thing<00:03:39.799> and<00:03:40.540> I<00:03:41.540> would<00:03:41.690> try<00:03:41.840> this

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
did the same thing and I would try this

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.110 
did the same thing and I would try this
and<00:03:42.350> see<00:03:42.980> how<00:03:43.160> you<00:03:43.370> like<00:03:43.519> it<00:03:43.670> and<00:03:43.910> if<00:03:44.000> you

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
and see how you like it and if you

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.250 
and see how you like it and if you
really<00:03:44.299> like<00:03:44.540> it<00:03:44.570> and<00:03:44.750> you<00:03:44.810> want<00:03:45.019> to<00:03:45.079> try<00:03:45.200> this

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
really like it and you want to try this

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.289 
really like it and you want to try this
one<00:03:45.410> out<00:03:45.500> then<00:03:45.769> you<00:03:45.860> could<00:03:46.310> I<00:03:46.549> don't<00:03:47.209> really

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
one out then you could I don't really

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.479 
one out then you could I don't really
say<00:03:47.750> which<00:03:47.989> one<00:03:48.140> I<00:03:48.170> would<00:03:48.380> buy<00:03:48.530> over<00:03:48.980> another

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
say which one I would buy over another

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.490 
say which one I would buy over another
because<00:03:50.360> I<00:03:50.390> haven't<00:03:50.660> had<00:03:50.840> it<00:03:51.019> on<00:03:51.110> for<00:03:51.170> so<00:03:51.470> long

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
because I haven't had it on for so long

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.289 
because I haven't had it on for so long
but<00:03:52.040> you<00:03:52.340> know<00:03:52.459> I<00:03:52.489> think<00:03:52.670> they're<00:03:52.910> both<00:03:53.060> really

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
but you know I think they're both really
