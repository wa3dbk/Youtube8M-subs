questions and these are these are things
that<00:02:46.760> you<00:02:46.940> should<00:02:47.120> play<00:02:47.330> with<00:02:47.360> burn<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:48.080> iso

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
that you should play with burn the iso

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
see if it works see if it doesn't try to

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.199 
see if it works see if it doesn't try to
figure<00:02:51.140> out<00:02:51.319> if<00:02:51.560> why<00:02:51.950> it<00:02:52.010> does<00:02:52.370> or<00:02:52.610> doesn't<00:02:52.819> now

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.339 
that i'm going through this with this
question<00:02:58.610> is<00:02:58.790> because<00:02:59.120> it<00:02:59.299> does<00:02:59.540> bring<00:02:59.900> up<00:03:00.140> a

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
question is because it does bring up a

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:01.960 
question is because it does bring up a
good<00:03:00.590> point<00:03:00.650> whenever<00:03:01.280> you're<00:03:01.580> dealing<00:03:01.730> with

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
good point whenever you're dealing with

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.240 
good point whenever you're dealing with
USB<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:02.810> this<00:03:03.380> is<00:03:03.530> something<00:03:03.650> that<00:03:03.890> a<00:03:04.040> lot<00:03:04.099> of

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
USB and this is something that a lot of

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.160 
USB and this is something that a lot of
you<00:03:04.400> guys<00:03:04.430> may<00:03:04.819> not<00:03:05.030> realize<00:03:05.510> especially<00:03:05.750> if

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
you guys may not realize especially if

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.120 
you guys may not realize especially if
you're<00:03:06.290> playing<00:03:06.440> around<00:03:06.650> with<00:03:06.830> things<00:03:06.980> like

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
you're playing around with things like

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.120 
you're playing around with things like
live<00:03:07.519> live<00:03:08.269> disks<00:03:08.840> is<00:03:08.930> do<00:03:09.650> remember<00:03:10.010> that

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
live live disks is do remember that

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.580 
live live disks is do remember that
there<00:03:10.370> have<00:03:10.519> been<00:03:10.549> multiple<00:03:10.970> versions<00:03:11.690> of<00:03:12.230> us

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
there have been multiple versions of us

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.190 
there have been multiple versions of us
be<00:03:12.830> over<00:03:13.130> the<00:03:13.220> years<00:03:13.459> so<00:03:13.640> there<00:03:13.790> was<00:03:13.970> USB<00:03:14.480> one

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
be over the years so there was USB one

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:23.590 
be over the years so there was USB one
point<00:03:15.530> 0<00:03:15.680> USB<00:03:16.459> 1.1<00:03:17.150> USB<00:03:17.780> 2.0<00:03:18.100> USB<00:03:21.459> 3.1<00:03:22.540> why<00:03:23.540> this

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
point 0 USB 1.1 USB 2.0 USB 3.1 why this

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.300 
point 0 USB 1.1 USB 2.0 USB 3.1 why this
is<00:03:23.840> important<00:03:24.350> is<00:03:24.440> that<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:24.859> interface

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
is important is that the interface

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.039 
is important is that the interface
speeds<00:03:25.790> for<00:03:26.120> those<00:03:26.239> different<00:03:26.600> versions<00:03:26.959> of

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
speeds for those different versions of

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.090 
speeds for those different versions of
USB<00:03:27.640> are<00:03:28.840> vastly<00:03:29.840> different<00:03:30.380> so<00:03:30.530> apparently<00:03:30.980> a

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
USB are vastly different so apparently a

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.099 
USB are vastly different so apparently a
USB<00:03:31.850> one<00:03:32.060> point<00:03:32.329> oh<00:03:32.450> I<00:03:32.480> haven't<00:03:32.720> seen<00:03:32.959> in<00:03:33.049> a

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
USB one point oh I haven't seen in a

something like that i would probably say

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.800 
something like that i would probably say
that<00:05:04.070> one<00:05:04.520> or<00:05:04.670> that<00:05:04.700> one<00:05:04.820> point<00:05:05.270> one<00:05:05.540> would

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
that one or that one point one would

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.800 
that one or that one point one would
fail<00:05:06.080> you<00:05:06.620> go<00:05:06.770> to<00:05:06.830> USB<00:05:07.160> 2.0<00:05:07.580> it'll<00:05:08.180> be<00:05:08.300> faster

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
fail you go to USB 2.0 it'll be faster

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.030 
fail you go to USB 2.0 it'll be faster
so<00:05:09.050> most<00:05:09.230> of<00:05:09.380> the<00:05:09.440> the<00:05:10.130> the<00:05:10.520> live<00:05:10.960> CDs<00:05:12.040> should

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
so most of the the the live CDs should

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.620 
so most of the the the live CDs should
be<00:05:13.250> able<00:05:13.550> to<00:05:13.610> work<00:05:13.790> but<00:05:14.060> it<00:05:14.150> will<00:05:14.300> be<00:05:14.450> a<00:05:14.480> little

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
be able to work but it will be a little

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.110 
be able to work but it will be a little
slow<00:05:15.020> if<00:05:15.380> you<00:05:15.470> go<00:05:15.590> up<00:05:15.680> to<00:05:15.710> USB<00:05:16.010> 3.0<00:05:16.790> it

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
slow if you go up to USB 3.0 it

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.700 
slow if you go up to USB 3.0 it
shouldn't<00:05:17.630> be<00:05:17.690> any<00:05:17.720> big<00:05:18.050> deal<00:05:18.080> at<00:05:18.350> all<00:05:18.440> it

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
shouldn't be any big deal at all it

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.500 
shouldn't be any big deal at all it

should be very fast the other thing to

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:21.790 
should be very fast the other thing to

realize is some of you guys are using

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.560 
realize is some of you guys are using
these<00:05:21.920> really<00:05:22.220> old<00:05:22.250> computers<00:05:22.730> with<00:05:22.910> USB<00:05:23.240> one

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
these really old computers with USB one

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.660 
these really old computers with USB one
or<00:05:23.720> 1.1<00:05:24.110> connections<00:05:24.650> and<00:05:24.860> again<00:05:25.340> that's

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:25.670 
or 1.1 connections and again that's

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.760 
or 1.1 connections and again that's
probably<00:05:25.970> not<00:05:26.300> going<00:05:26.450> to<00:05:26.510> work<00:05:26.660> for<00:05:26.690> you<00:05:26.870> the

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
probably not going to work for you the

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.050 
probably not going to work for you the
other<00:05:27.890> thing<00:05:28.040> to<00:05:28.130> think<00:05:28.160> about<00:05:28.310> though<00:05:28.580> is<00:05:28.730> a

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
other thing to think about though is a

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.300 
other thing to think about though is a
lot<00:05:29.270> of<00:05:29.360> computers<00:05:29.810> that<00:05:30.440> you<00:05:30.590> bought<00:05:30.890> if<00:05:31.160> you

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
lot of computers that you bought if you

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.220 
lot of computers that you bought if you
bought<00:05:31.550> them<00:05:31.730> a<00:05:31.850> couple<00:05:32.120> of<00:05:32.180> years<00:05:32.210> ago<00:05:32.510> for

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.230 
bought them a couple of years ago for

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.500 
bought them a couple of years ago for
some<00:05:33.500> reason<00:05:33.980> and<00:05:34.100> I<00:05:34.190> don't<00:05:34.370> know<00:05:34.520> why<00:05:34.820> they're

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
some reason and I don't know why they're

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.150 
some reason and I don't know why they're
doing<00:05:35.540> this<00:05:35.780> probably<00:05:36.140> just<00:05:36.350> to<00:05:36.590> be<00:05:36.680> cheap<00:05:36.980> is

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
doing this probably just to be cheap is

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.020 
doing this probably just to be cheap is
that<00:05:37.910> some<00:05:38.510> USB<00:05:38.960> ports<00:05:39.440> on<00:05:39.590> the<00:05:40.250> computer<00:05:40.820> our

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
that some USB ports on the computer our

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.690 
that some USB ports on the computer our
USB<00:05:41.360> 2.0<00:05:41.720> and<00:05:42.290> some<00:05:42.860> ports<00:05:43.160> on<00:05:43.280> your<00:05:43.370> computer

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:43.700 
USB 2.0 and some ports on your computer

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.430 
USB 2.0 and some ports on your computer
are<00:05:43.820> USB<00:05:44.230> 3.0<00:05:46.480> your<00:05:47.480> little<00:05:47.690> external<00:05:48.050> drive

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
are USB 3.0 your little external drive

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.620 
are USB 3.0 your little external drive
into<00:05:48.740> the<00:05:48.830> USB<00:05:48.860> 2.0<00:05:49.460> connection<00:05:50.270> it's<00:05:50.450> going

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
into the USB 2.0 connection it's going

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.840 
into the USB 2.0 connection it's going
to<00:05:50.720> be<00:05:50.780> really<00:05:51.080> horribly<00:05:51.740> slow<00:05:51.950> and<00:05:52.370> if<00:05:52.760> you

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:52.850 
to be really horribly slow and if you

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.240 
to be really horribly slow and if you
plug<00:05:53.030> it<00:05:53.150> into<00:05:53.300> a<00:05:53.420> USB<00:05:53.660> 3.1<00:05:54.380> it'll<00:05:55.010> be<00:05:55.070> really

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
plug it into a USB 3.1 it'll be really

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.770 
plug it into a USB 3.1 it'll be really
fast<00:05:55.550> and<00:05:55.910> the<00:05:56.180> only<00:05:56.300> difference<00:05:56.660> is

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
fast and the only difference is

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.960 
fast and the only difference is
literally<00:05:57.470> what<00:05:57.770> port<00:05:58.100> you<00:05:58.250> plug<00:05:58.460> it<00:05:58.610> into<00:05:58.730> on

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
literally what port you plug it into on

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.750 
literally what port you plug it into on
the<00:05:59.060> back<00:05:59.210> of<00:05:59.240> the<00:05:59.480> motherboard<00:05:59.930> so<00:06:00.620> if<00:06:01.340> you<00:06:01.550> do

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
the back of the motherboard so if you do

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.130 
the back of the motherboard so if you do
have<00:06:01.910> a<00:06:01.940> computer<00:06:02.270> make<00:06:02.570> sure<00:06:02.780> to<00:06:02.930> try<00:06:03.080> to

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:03.140 
have a computer make sure to try to

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.100 
have a computer make sure to try to
figure<00:06:03.350> out<00:06:03.470> which<00:06:04.090> USB<00:06:05.090> ports<00:06:05.420> you<00:06:05.540> have<00:06:05.750> and

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
figure out which USB ports you have and

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.110 
figure out which USB ports you have and
see<00:06:06.830> if<00:06:06.920> they<00:06:07.070> are<00:06:07.130> all<00:06:07.280> the<00:06:07.400> same<00:06:07.580> again<00:06:07.970> I've

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
see if they are all the same again I've

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.160 
see if they are all the same again I've
seen<00:06:08.270> this<00:06:08.360> with<00:06:08.510> a<00:06:08.570> lot<00:06:08.750> of<00:06:08.810> the<00:06:08.960> older

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:09.170 
seen this with a lot of the older

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.140 
seen this with a lot of the older
computer<00:06:09.560> like<00:06:10.400> three<00:06:10.670> or<00:06:10.760> four<00:06:10.820> year<00:06:11.030> old

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
computer like three or four year old

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.720 
computer like three or four year old
computers<00:06:11.510> where<00:06:11.690> half<00:06:12.530> the<00:06:12.560> ports<00:06:12.980> USB<00:06:13.160> 3.0

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:13.730 
computers where half the ports USB 3.0

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:18.940 
computers where half the ports USB 3.0
half<00:06:14.240> the<00:06:14.360> ports<00:06:14.600> USB<00:06:14.780> two<00:06:15.080> point<00:06:17.680> by<00:06:18.680> simply

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:18.950 
half the ports USB two point by simply

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.860 
half the ports USB two point by simply
plugging<00:06:19.160> your<00:06:19.400> drive<00:06:19.640> into<00:06:19.910> one<00:06:20.180> port<00:06:20.510> versus

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870 
plugging your drive into one port versus

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.450 
plugging your drive into one port versus
the<00:06:20.990> other<00:06:21.020> the<00:06:21.590> other<00:06:21.770> thing<00:06:22.100> to<00:06:22.190> think<00:06:22.280> about

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
the other the other thing to think about

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.520 
the other the other thing to think about
again<00:06:22.730> whenever<00:06:23.060> you're<00:06:23.420> dealing<00:06:23.600> with<00:06:23.810> with

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:24.530 
again whenever you're dealing with with

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.380 
again whenever you're dealing with with
any<00:06:24.830> devices<00:06:25.250> really<00:06:25.790> especially<00:06:26.330> when

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:26.390 
any devices really especially when

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.120 
any devices really especially when
you're<00:06:26.510> dealing<00:06:26.570> with<00:06:26.720> USB<00:06:27.200> is<00:06:27.440> remember

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
you're dealing with USB is remember

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.770 
you're dealing with USB is remember
there<00:06:28.280> are<00:06:28.310> two<00:06:28.550> sides<00:06:28.850> of<00:06:29.090> the<00:06:29.210> equation

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 
there are two sides of the equation

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.810 
there are two sides of the equation
there<00:06:29.990> is<00:06:30.140> your<00:06:30.320> there's<00:06:30.890> your<00:06:31.100> computer<00:06:31.610> so

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:31.820 
there is your there's your computer so

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.790 
there is your there's your computer so
what<00:06:32.660> ports<00:06:33.140> does<00:06:33.230> your<00:06:33.380> computer<00:06:33.500> have

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800 
what ports does your computer have

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.970 
what ports does your computer have
dessert<00:06:34.220> here<00:06:34.730> to<00:06:34.820> have<00:06:34.940> USB<00:06:35.440> 11.1<00:06:36.440> two<00:06:36.740> or

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:36.980 
dessert here to have USB 11.1 two or

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.690 
dessert here to have USB 11.1 two or
three<00:06:37.330> also

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:38.700 
three also

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.660 
three also
also<00:06:39.660> what<00:06:40.260> is<00:06:40.410> the<00:06:40.740> device<00:06:41.220> you<00:06:41.250> are<00:06:41.520> using

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:41.670 
also what is the device you are using

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:44.840 
also what is the device you are using
because<00:06:42.210> USB<00:06:42.810> is<00:06:43.020> backward<00:06:43.560> compatible<00:06:43.850> so

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:44.850 
because USB is backward compatible so

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.000 
because USB is backward compatible so
you<00:06:44.910> can<00:06:45.090> plug<00:06:45.300> a<00:06:45.450> USB<00:06:45.480> one<00:06:46.140> device<00:06:46.440> into<00:06:46.740> a<00:06:46.770> USB

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.010 
you can plug a USB one device into a USB

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:49.310 
you can plug a USB one device into a USB
3.0<00:06:47.640> port<00:06:48.000> right<00:06:48.330> so<00:06:48.750> if<00:06:48.840> you<00:06:48.930> have<00:06:49.080> some

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.320 
3.0 port right so if you have some

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.570 
3.0 port right so if you have some
crappy<00:06:50.010> old<00:06:50.510> memorex<00:06:51.510> external<00:06:52.430> CD<00:06:53.430> or

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:53.580 
crappy old memorex external CD or

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.030 
crappy old memorex external CD or
optical<00:06:54.030> drive<00:06:54.270> for<00:06:54.840> all<00:06:54.960> I<00:06:54.990> know<00:06:55.200> that

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:56.040 
optical drive for all I know that

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.030 
optical drive for all I know that
external<00:06:56.850> drive<00:06:57.090> is<00:06:57.270> a<00:06:57.300> USB<00:06:57.900> one<00:06:58.350> point<00:06:58.800> Oh

00:06:59.030 --> 00:06:59.040 
external drive is a USB one point Oh

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.400 
external drive is a USB one point Oh
device<00:06:59.670> so<00:07:00.240> even<00:07:00.570> if<00:07:00.630> you<00:07:00.720> populate<00:07:01.080> it<00:07:01.200> into<00:07:01.380> a

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:01.410 
device so even if you populate it into a

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.650 
device so even if you populate it into a
three-point<00:07:02.160> oh<00:07:02.280> poor<00:07:02.730> it's<00:07:03.240> still<00:07:03.480> going<00:07:03.600> to

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:03.660 
three-point oh poor it's still going to

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:04.940 
three-point oh poor it's still going to
get<00:07:03.780> one<00:07:03.900> point<00:07:04.020> five<00:07:04.200> megabits<00:07:04.500> per<00:07:04.590> second

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:04.950 
get one point five megabits per second

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.160 
get one point five megabits per second
is<00:07:05.040> still<00:07:05.220> not<00:07:05.310> going<00:07:05.400> to<00:07:05.460> work<00:07:05.670> worth<00:07:05.850> a<00:07:05.970> darn

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:06.170
