your legs instead of your legs taking
your<00:01:03.469> spine<00:01:04.689> you're<00:01:05.689> not<00:01:05.899> better<00:01:06.200> or<00:01:06.470> worse

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
your spine you're not better or worse

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.090 
your spine you're not better or worse
they're<00:01:07.040> just<00:01:07.250> different<00:01:08.710> versus<00:01:09.710> this<00:01:09.890> whole

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
they're just different versus this whole

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.840 
they're just different versus this whole
unit<00:01:10.520> just<00:01:10.670> getting<00:01:11.000> locked<00:01:11.240> together<00:01:12.640> but<00:01:13.640> do

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
unit just getting locked together but do

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.760 
unit just getting locked together but do
that<00:01:13.880> also<00:01:14.299> so<00:01:14.720> you<00:01:14.750> feel<00:01:15.080> the<00:01:15.200> difference<00:01:15.590> so

this way which means my sacrum through

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:10.570 
this way which means my sacrum through
the<00:05:05.870> tail<00:05:06.169> actually<00:05:06.469> is<00:05:06.919> going<00:05:07.159> down<00:05:08.919> then<00:05:09.919> my

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
the tail actually is going down then my

the<00:05:38.090> side<00:05:38.330> of<00:05:38.510> your<00:05:38.630> body<00:05:38.900> feels<00:05:39.350> like<00:05:39.680> now<00:05:40.280> as

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
the side of your body feels like now as

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.840 
the side of your body feels like now as
you<00:05:40.520> can<00:05:40.610> tell<00:05:40.850> it's<00:05:41.000> Lincoln<00:05:41.570> neck<00:05:41.750> and<00:05:42.080> spine

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
you can tell it's Lincoln neck and spine

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:48.310 
you can tell it's Lincoln neck and spine
if<00:05:43.850> you<00:05:44.030> see<00:05:44.240> that<00:05:44.420> if<00:05:44.570> I<00:05:44.690> go<00:05:44.840> like<00:05:45.050> this<00:05:47.320> this

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
if you see that if I go like this this

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.230 
if you see that if I go like this this
is<00:05:48.500> actually<00:05:48.680> more<00:05:49.040> polio<00:05:49.490> seismic<00:05:50.030> would

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
is actually more polio seismic would

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.060 
is actually more polio seismic would
normally<00:05:50.750> be<00:05:50.930> this<00:05:51.200> would<00:05:51.380> be<00:05:51.530> the<00:05:51.680> longer

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
normally be this would be the longer

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.310
