and I pull it back in nothings and it's
pretty<00:07:02.140> cool<00:07:02.290> gimmick<00:07:02.470> I<00:07:02.860> like<00:07:03.010> it<00:07:03.190> and<00:07:04.200> this

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:05.200 
pretty cool gimmick I like it and this

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.060 
pretty cool gimmick I like it and this
one<00:07:05.530> is<00:07:05.800> the<00:07:06.010> trick<00:07:06.280> called<00:07:06.520> evacuate<00:07:07.270> I

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:08.070 
one is the trick called evacuate I

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.200 
one is the trick called evacuate I
really<00:07:09.070> like<00:07:09.220> that<00:07:09.400> you<00:07:09.670> can<00:07:09.790> check<00:07:09.940> out<00:07:10.060> my

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:10.210 
really like that you can check out my

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:11.880 
really like that you can check out my
performance<00:07:10.720> of<00:07:10.840> it<00:07:10.990> it's<00:07:11.350> a<00:07:11.410> really<00:07:11.770> good

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:11.890 
performance of it it's a really good

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.940 
performance of it it's a really good
trick<00:07:12.810> probably<00:07:13.810> the<00:07:13.960> most<00:07:14.050> effective<00:07:14.380> that

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:14.950 
trick probably the most effective that

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:18.840 
trick probably the most effective that
I've<00:07:15.070> seen<00:07:15.330> and<00:07:16.330> then<00:07:17.040> this<00:07:18.040> is<00:07:18.220> a<00:07:18.280> mandolin

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:18.850 
I've seen and then this is a mandolin

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:22.020 
I've seen and then this is a mandolin
back<00:07:19.120> deck<00:07:19.720> of<00:07:19.750> playing<00:07:19.930> cards<00:07:20.670> from<00:07:21.670> Andy

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:22.030 
back deck of playing cards from Andy

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:26.390 
back deck of playing cards from Andy
field<00:07:22.210> magic<00:07:22.690> I<00:07:23.130> think<00:07:24.130> is<00:07:24.220> a<00:07:24.250> gimmick<00:07:24.640> um<00:07:24.940> I

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.400 
field magic I think is a gimmick um I

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.840 
field magic I think is a gimmick um I
think<00:07:27.400> it's<00:07:27.670> a<00:07:29.130> stripper<00:07:30.130> deck<00:07:30.250> right<00:07:30.610> there

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:30.850 
think it's a stripper deck right there

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:31.890 
think it's a stripper deck right there
yeah

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:31.900 
yeah

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:36.720 
yeah
