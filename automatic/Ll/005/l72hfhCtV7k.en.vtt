website and had that website marketed
properly<00:00:23.670> but<00:00:24.330> it<00:00:24.449> was<00:00:24.570> very<00:00:25.080> difficult<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.769> do

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
properly but it was very difficult to do

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.040 
properly but it was very difficult to do
when<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:26.609> found<00:00:26.910> out<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:27.449> was<00:00:27.480> limited<00:00:28.019> to

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
when I found out that I was limited to

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.740 
when I found out that I was limited to
dial<00:00:28.380> up<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:29.039> couldn't<00:00:29.519> do<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.970> editing<00:00:30.179> with

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
dial up you couldn't do the editing with

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.900 
dial up you couldn't do the editing with
it<00:00:30.900> certain<00:00:31.109> editing<00:00:31.679> programs<00:00:32.250> because<00:00:32.790> of

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
it certain editing programs because of

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.530 
it certain editing programs because of
dial-up<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.559> was<00:00:34.710> very<00:00:34.739> expensive<00:00:35.730> for<00:00:36.510> a

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
dial-up so it was very expensive for a

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.740 
dial-up so it was very expensive for a
new<00:00:36.750> business<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.680> have<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.129> pay<00:00:38.460> every<00:00:39.300> time<00:00:39.719> I

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
new business to have to pay every time I

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.130 
new business to have to pay every time I
needed<00:00:40.200> somebody<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.800> go<00:00:40.980> in<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.730> do<00:00:42.450> anything

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
needed somebody to go in and do anything

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.040 
needed somebody to go in and do anything
to<00:00:43.559> my<00:00:43.710> website<00:00:43.950> i<00:00:44.520> found<00:00:44.610> out<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.059> i<00:00:45.390> could

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
to my website i found out that i could

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.819 
to my website i found out that i could
probably<00:00:46.440> do<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:46.860> with<00:00:47.070> satellite<00:00:47.579> but<00:00:48.829> on

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
probably do it with satellite but on

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.600 
probably do it with satellite but on
some<00:00:50.280> days<00:00:50.309> it's<00:00:50.969> not<00:00:51.180> any<00:00:51.420> better<00:00:51.539> than

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
some days it's not any better than

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.910 
some days it's not any better than
dial-up<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.390> has<00:00:54.420> been<00:00:54.960> frustrating<00:00:55.320> to

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
dial-up so it has been frustrating to

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.920 
dial-up so it has been frustrating to
say<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.160> least<00:00:56.309> yes<00:00:56.969> i<00:00:57.149> have<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.300> facebook<00:00:57.719> page

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
say the least yes i have a facebook page

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.560 
say the least yes i have a facebook page

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
and yes i'm a myspace page but like I

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.810 
and yes i'm a myspace page but like I
say<00:01:00.780> all<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.170> interaction<00:01:01.710> takes<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.579> much

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
say all this interaction takes so much

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.060 
say all this interaction takes so much
time<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.660> wouldn't<00:01:04.080> if<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.260> had<00:01:04.470> high<00:01:04.680> speed
