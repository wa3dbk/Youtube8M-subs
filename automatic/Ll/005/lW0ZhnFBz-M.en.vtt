00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.790 
coding for the video engine of this
was<00:02:08.920> first<00:02:09.220> actually<00:02:09.520> on<00:02:09.850> iphone<00:02:10.240> and<00:02:10.680> made<00:02:11.680> us

was first actually on iphone and made us
an<00:02:11.950> official<00:02:12.280> part<00:02:12.460> of<00:02:12.490> the<00:02:12.550> 3GS<00:02:12.910> release

which was pretty exciting but um there's
a<00:02:15.430> lot<00:02:15.550> of<00:02:15.700> artists<00:02:16.150> now<00:02:16.270> that<00:02:16.570> have<00:02:16.690> iPhone

this<00:02:24.460> up<00:02:24.700> I<00:02:25.170> Pro<00:02:26.170> detect<00:02:26.440> it<00:02:26.560> myself<00:02:26.710> and<00:02:27.190> I

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
this up I Pro detect it myself and I

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.560 
this up I Pro detect it myself and I
coated<00:02:28.360> it<00:02:28.510> with<00:02:28.570> three<00:02:28.840> other<00:02:28.870> people<00:02:29.310> so

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
coated it with three other people so

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.990 
coated it with three other people so
right<00:02:31.570> here<00:02:31.750> at<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:31.960> play<00:02:32.140> button<00:02:32.470> and<00:02:33.000> turn

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
right here at the play button and turn

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.770 
right here at the play button and turn
this<00:02:34.120> up<00:02:34.330> way<00:02:34.840> up<00:02:38.730> so<00:02:39.730> I<00:02:40.000> have<00:02:40.270> this<00:02:40.450> really

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
this up way up so I have this really

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.270 
this up way up so I have this really
cool<00:02:41.080> pretty<00:02:42.010> moving<00:02:42.670> animations<00:02:43.740> and<00:02:44.740> up

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
cool pretty moving animations and up

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.710 
cool pretty moving animations and up
here<00:02:45.610> are<00:02:45.790> effects<00:02:46.180> so<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.970> spits<00:02:49.300> it<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.600> the

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
here are effects so it spits it to the

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.010 
here are effects so it spits it to the
beasts<00:02:51.300> everything<00:02:52.300> in<00:02:52.390> this<00:02:52.480> happens<00:02:52.870> on

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
beasts everything in this happens on

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.940 
beasts everything in this happens on
time<00:02:53.290> if<00:02:53.680> I<00:02:53.800> switch<00:02:54.130> something<00:02:55.620> so<00:02:56.620> I<00:02:56.680> switch

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
time if I switch something so I switch

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.920 
time if I switch something so I switch
something<00:02:57.340> offbeat<00:02:57.550> it's<00:02:58.300> gonna<00:02:58.480> happen<00:02:58.720> on

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
something offbeat it's gonna happen on

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.330 
something offbeat it's gonna happen on
the<00:02:59.050> next<00:02:59.080> down<00:02:59.440> Beebe's

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.850 

the<00:03:03.340> real<00:03:03.730> time<00:03:03.970> filter<00:03:04.360> citizen<00:03:07.350> and<00:03:08.350> it's<00:03:08.770> a

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
the real time filter citizen and it's a

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.230 
the real time filter citizen and it's a
stutter<00:03:09.190> editing<00:03:09.550> using<00:03:09.790> accelerometers

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
stutter editing using accelerometers

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:49.070 
stutter editing using accelerometers
again

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:55.130 

so<00:03:49.650> this<00:03:50.550> is<00:03:50.670> it<00:03:50.930> and<00:03:52.640> it's<00:03:53.640> amazing<00:03:54.390> how<00:03:54.660> far

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
so this is it and it's amazing how far

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.240 
so this is it and it's amazing how far
you<00:03:55.320> can<00:03:55.530> take<00:03:55.560> this<00:03:56.520> track<00:03:56.970> from<00:03:58.130> you<00:03:59.130> know

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
you can take this track from you know

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.490 
you can take this track from you know
where<00:03:59.670> it<00:03:59.790> is<00:03:59.940> and<00:04:00.120> he's<00:04:00.210> for<00:04:00.480> different<00:04:00.900> for

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
where it is and he's for different for

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.200 
where it is and he's for different for
permutations<00:04:01.830> of<00:04:02.190> for<00:04:02.400> permutation<00:04:02.940> so<00:04:03.090> it's

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
permutations of for permutation so it's

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.390 
permutations of for permutation so it's
it's<00:04:03.630> basically<00:04:03.930> a<00:04:04.050> 16<00:04:04.530> by<00:04:04.680> matrices<00:04:05.190> of

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
it's basically a 16 by matrices of

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.390 
it's basically a 16 by matrices of
tracks<00:04:05.790> and<00:04:06.600> another<00:04:07.350> super<00:04:07.920> cool<00:04:08.160> thing

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
tracks and another super cool thing

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.320 
tracks and another super cool thing
about<00:04:08.550> it<00:04:08.700> is<00:04:09.260> and<00:04:10.260> it<00:04:11.010> was<00:04:11.160> also<00:04:11.520> too<00:04:11.910> a<00:04:11.940> first

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
about it is and it was also too a first

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.810 
about it is and it was also too a first
for<00:04:12.660> the<00:04:12.750> iPhone<00:04:13.110> was<00:04:13.650> we<00:04:14.430> were<00:04:14.760> able<00:04:15.030> to<00:04:15.480> crack

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
for the iPhone was we were able to crack

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.449 
for the iPhone was we were able to crack
Bluetooth<00:04:17.820> sync<00:04:18.330> to<00:04:18.900> communicate<00:04:19.709> tempo

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
Bluetooth sync to communicate tempo

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.910 
Bluetooth sync to communicate tempo
between<00:04:20.910> two<00:04:21.180> devices<00:04:21.450> which<00:04:22.320> is<00:04:22.500> very

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
between two devices which is very

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.280 
between two devices which is very
difficult<00:04:23.130> to<00:04:23.490> query<00:04:23.790> honestly<00:04:24.750> in<00:04:24.870> real<00:04:25.020> time

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
difficult to query honestly in real time

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.930 
difficult to query honestly in real time
because<00:04:25.500> there's<00:04:26.070> a<00:04:26.160> proximal<00:04:26.670> effect

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
because there's a proximal effect

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.310 
because there's a proximal effect
depending<00:04:27.270> on<00:04:27.360> where<00:04:27.570> someone's<00:04:27.900> standing

depending on where someone's standing
next<00:04:28.830> to<00:04:29.010> you<00:04:29.130> so<00:04:29.190> you<00:04:29.280> have<00:04:29.310> to<00:04:29.400> wreak<00:04:30.060> worry

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
next to you so you have to wreak worry

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.770 
next to you so you have to wreak worry
that<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:31.020> the<00:04:31.350> device<00:04:31.680> is<00:04:31.950> so<00:04:32.520> this<00:04:33.270> actually

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
that the the device is so this actually

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.620 
that the the device is so this actually
will<00:04:33.810> sync<00:04:34.380> with<00:04:35.010> another<00:04:35.340> iPhone<00:04:35.820> or<00:04:36.180> iPod

airport so so yeah so at any rate that
is<00:05:01.110> sonic<00:05:01.440> wise<00:05:01.560> the<00:05:01.740> first<00:05:01.980> thing<00:05:02.160> that<00:05:02.190> we

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
is sonic wise the first thing that we

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.940 
is sonic wise the first thing that we
released<00:05:02.700> at<00:05:02.820> sonic<00:05:03.090> architects<00:05:03.480> in<00:05:03.600> and<00:05:03.950> we

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
released at sonic architects in and we

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.230
