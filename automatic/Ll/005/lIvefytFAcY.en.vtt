00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.139
 It would only be good to be all very well. 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.089
 come to another game play commented 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.320
 here on the good channel next guys 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.940
 I wanted to talk a little today with 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.550
 about the rumors that come out in the 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.199
 être backstage is there as you already 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.359
 realized by the title is the following we 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.510
 we will comment on the end of production 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.550
 of xbox 360 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.270
 Why did it happen because it came about 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.500
 So these rumors, let's start. 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.260
 content that has been 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.930
 reported uno uno is certain that 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.070
 some breakdowns in the 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:48.480
 production of the 360 ​​had stopped to 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.550
 gives space to the production of xbox one in this 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.680
 So you've already seen that we start to 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.010
 raise several rumors about various 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.050
 things that happen once in order to 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.980
 Microsoft itself mentioned that 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:06.330
 we would then support xbox 360 with 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.250
 xbox live content until 2018 is not this 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.040
 there at least the content of the new in the new 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.619
 including dashboard was even increased 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.470
 storage sector because there is 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.750
 microsoft gives two free games per 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.400
 month for who has live gold and with that 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.100
 then storage space that the 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.220
 user had default was very scarce 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.829
 then the water was then expanded 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.009
 storage there for 4 terabytes and via 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.909
 usb support each usb device 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:38.520
 ie each usb output of 2 terabytes 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:41.130
 very well to these rumors then from 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.439
 of that part where it was mentioned in 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.810
 which are these sectors of the 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.229
 production would be canceled or 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.720
 be stopped in order to give priority to 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:54.479
 to xbox the year and that's right because the 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.939
 xbox the year tends to grow every month and 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.000
 of course a lot was announced only 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.520
 that this point has already been disclosed 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.759
 including for a few pages 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.829
 here in Brazil is also included 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.860
 mentioned by the one page back 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.420
 leaving the link below in the description 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.340
 mentioning a little type to leak the 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.980
 information from 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.450
 a form that is even more complex than 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.819
 It does not matter 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.580
 Let's then understand a little bit 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.950
 What happened, what happened? 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.959
 next some of the lines we'll go 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.910
 suppose we are in a factory you have 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.370
 ten production lines, right? 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.739
 there is a mount piece other mounts plate 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.019
 another mountain I do not know what 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.620
 which happens the following some sectors 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:42.799
 of this production line are being 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.660
 summarized to cancellation for the 360 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.180
 it is right and the use of this line of 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.030
 production for mounting one Xbox One 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.160
 that the market path is 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.650
 right and cost market with 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.230
 feasible for this is not feasible for them 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.959
 maintain a production line and 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.010
 it 's not being slow to billy try 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.340
 profitability is not taking place 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.890
 Grana, it's not making a profit. 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.930
 so like xbox 360 will go 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.959
 continue thus in production line 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.900
 at least until 2015 the end of 2015 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:18.440
 for 2016 was announced nothing of 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.959
 concrete type if the line is active 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.600
 is right once that in 2015 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.190
 even made new boards for the console 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.519
 So that means they are dedicating themselves 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.519
 Yes, the console is having a 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.049
 attention to mothers at least here in 2015 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.389
 if it would not be all the same 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.859
 a new plaque review was announced 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:39.889
 including headache pain 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:42.230
 many technicians here all over the 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:44.810
 brazil around the world but it is the following 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.269
 as I mentioned to you 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.940
 This is a misunderstanding in my 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:53.269
 point of view ended up misinterpreted 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.569
 let's say so in which was money 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:59.690
 this whole controversy would have or would not 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:01.549
 such a mount in the assembly line type 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.120
 will not do more will not manufacture more 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:09.290
 So it was not good, that's right. 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:12.319
 that was reported one official type is 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.560
 certain not official content I do not know if 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:18.410
 so far microsoft will pronounce 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.690
 about this beauty and pronounce on 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.969
 This I come make a video to 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.469
 You are beauty then next galera. 

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:27.030
 confirmed at least I counted 

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:29.790
 Mentioning you are safe sources. 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.860
 It's not no source but br sources 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.830
 information stating that the 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.740
 next we will still have the xbox 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.300
 360 in the production line , ie the 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.400
 2015 model 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.700
 still in production line then 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.340
 possibly with the news of the xbox 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.200
 one to already with the retro 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.440
 compatibility or you will be able to 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:55.410
 play 360 games no one's this rumor 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.810
 even a little that strengthened knows more 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.669
 so the company itself did not take note 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.070
 confirming exactly how much the 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:04.440
 mentioned to you only the line of 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:07.650
 production is here in Brazil in the free zone 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:12.000
 of manaus in 2015 is at full throttle 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:16.020
 So, in 2016, if you get there 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.570
 something that's kind of that I do not 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:22.260
 I have information yet to mention 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.669
 I'm sure I'll bring you one. 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.380
 video for you guys I'll comment on one 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.910
 A little about this I would like to 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.150
 know your opinion 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:33.600
 what do you guys still think of xbox 360 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:36.240
 be produced mainly with the new 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.640
 board mainly with a new design 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.520
 mainly with a new performance 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.169
 because each plate that the appliance is 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.780
 developed in the apparatus possibly 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:49.080
 you have what the best performance of the 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:51.600
 Are you the best type 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.310
 best graphic sector you have the best 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.830
 photography I say so to avoid 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.960
 problems with gpu know he is 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.450
 problems with this type of processor 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.510
 thing then the entire appliance review is 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:05.430
 welcome once again to see that new 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.260
