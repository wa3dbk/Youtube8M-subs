00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
see here it's working quite fast looking

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.370 
see here it's working quite fast looking
beautiful<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:20.090> we<00:00:21.090> have<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.270> real<00:00:21.810> ties<00:00:22.110> noise

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
beautiful and we have a real ties noise

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.500 
beautiful and we have a real ties noise
but<00:00:23.250> as<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.730> can<00:00:23.880> see<00:00:24.030> this<00:00:24.150> is<00:00:24.270> just<00:00:24.300> a

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
but as you can see this is just a

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.010 
but as you can see this is just a
prototype

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
prototype

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.250 
prototype
it<00:00:25.410> could<00:00:25.680> there<00:00:26.130> could<00:00:26.310> be<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.460> smartphone<00:00:26.850> by

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
it could there could be a smartphone by

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.200 
it could there could be a smartphone by
Samsung<00:00:28.260> coming<00:00:28.470> out<00:00:28.650> sometime

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
Samsung coming out sometime

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.089 
Samsung coming out sometime
twice<00:00:30.210> noise<00:00:30.480> but<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.800> could<00:00:31.920> look<00:00:32.039> like

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
twice noise but and it could look like

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.220 
twice noise but and it could look like
this<00:00:32.309> but<00:00:32.579> it's<00:00:32.759> basically<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.360> four<00:00:33.840> points

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
this but it's basically a four points

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.290 
this but it's basically a four points
and<00:00:34.350> ATM<00:00:34.739> screen<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.309> something<00:00:35.910> like<00:00:35.940> that

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
and ATM screen so something like that

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.819 
and ATM screen so something like that
something<00:00:36.720> that<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.020> me<00:00:37.380> but<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.620> course

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
something that is me but of course

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.639 
something that is me but of course
that's<00:00:38.190> just<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.489> focus<00:00:38.880> here<00:00:39.060> for<00:00:39.540> example<00:00:39.989> on

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
that's just a focus here for example on

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.370 
that's just a focus here for example on
the<00:00:41.090> device<00:00:42.090> we<00:00:42.360> could<00:00:42.570> change<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.260> between

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
the device we could change in between

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.850 
the device we could change in between
office<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.040> basically<00:00:44.750> here<00:00:45.750> by<00:00:45.930> clicking<00:00:46.380> I

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
office and basically here by clicking I

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.459 
office and basically here by clicking I
think<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.340> did<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.670> just<00:00:48.210> by<00:00:48.510> going<00:00:48.840> here<00:00:49.140> from

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
think I did that just by going here from

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.160 
think I did that just by going here from
the<00:00:49.590> side<00:00:49.770> let's<00:00:50.010> go<00:00:50.250> back<00:00:50.460> here<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.940> can<00:00:51.899> go

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
the side let's go back here you can go

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.110 
the side let's go back here you can go
here<00:00:52.410> into<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.680> phone<00:00:52.950> part<00:00:53.579> which<00:00:53.790> looks

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
here into the phone part which looks

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.229 
here into the phone part which looks
completely<00:00:54.780> exactly<00:00:55.230> like<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.469> with<00:00:55.559> the

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
completely exactly like it with the

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.690 
completely exactly like it with the
Android<00:00:57.239> Samsung<00:00:57.719> device<00:00:58.170> when<00:00:59.040> we<00:00:59.160> go<00:00:59.309> for

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
Android Samsung device when we go for

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.910 
Android Samsung device when we go for
example<00:00:59.790> in<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.329> settings<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.989> can<00:01:01.410> see<00:01:01.649> here

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
example in the settings you can see here

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.039 
example in the settings you can see here
this<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.489> exactly<00:01:02.910> also<00:01:03.450> working<00:01:03.750> like<00:01:03.899> the

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
this is exactly also working like the

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.380 
this is exactly also working like the
new<00:01:04.199> Samsung<00:01:04.559> Galaxy<00:01:04.860> s5<00:01:05.129> menu

new Samsung Galaxy s5 menu

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.460 
new Samsung Galaxy s5 menu
there<00:01:08.390> we<00:01:08.480> have<00:01:08.659> chaos<00:01:08.990> of<00:01:09.170> different

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
there we have chaos of different

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.980 
there we have chaos of different
sections

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.050 

let's<00:01:12.500> just<00:01:12.650> go<00:01:12.830> back<00:01:13.010> then<00:01:13.370> we<00:01:13.460> can<00:01:13.640> see<00:01:13.850> of

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
let's just go back then we can see of

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.520 
let's just go back then we can see of
course<00:01:14.240> that<00:01:14.330> we<00:01:14.540> have<00:01:14.630> a<00:01:14.690> few<00:01:14.900> absence<00:01:15.290> talks

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
course that we have a few absence talks

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.070 
course that we have a few absence talks
here<00:01:15.740> for<00:01:15.920> example<00:01:16.100> NFC<00:01:16.700> dictionary<00:01:17.660> some

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
here for example NFC dictionary some

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.620 
here for example NFC dictionary some
little<00:01:18.380> games<00:01:18.620> and<00:01:19.000> also<00:01:20.000> you<00:01:20.180> can<00:01:20.330> just<00:01:20.510> see

check out some pictures of the camera
data<00:01:25.430> people<00:01:25.760> took<00:01:26.060> which<00:01:26.570> is<00:01:26.750> of<00:01:26.870> course<00:01:27.020> it's

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
data people took which is of course it's

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.750 
data people took which is of course it's
quite<00:01:27.320> good<00:01:27.350> camera<00:01:27.830> built-in<00:01:28.190> but<00:01:28.460> as<00:01:28.610> I<00:01:28.700> said

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
quite good camera built-in but as I said

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.670 
quite good camera built-in but as I said
is<00:01:29.030> just<00:01:29.060> a<00:01:29.240> prototype<00:01:29.540> so<00:01:29.960> the<00:01:30.440> device

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
is just a prototype so the device

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.170 
is just a prototype so the device
doesn't<00:01:30.920> have<00:01:31.040> to<00:01:31.280> be<00:01:31.460> like<00:01:31.700> this<00:01:31.880> when<00:01:32.090> it

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
doesn't have to be like this when it

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.930 
doesn't have to be like this when it
comes<00:01:32.210> to<00:01:32.570> market<00:01:33.160> just<00:01:34.160> our<00:01:34.340> camera<00:01:34.729> you<00:01:34.820> can

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
comes to market just our camera you can

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.090 
comes to market just our camera you can
see<00:01:34.970> of<00:01:35.270> course<00:01:35.300> that<00:01:36.050> we<00:01:36.229> have<00:01:36.380> here<00:01:36.619> the

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
see of course that we have here the

difference<00:02:34.280> as<00:02:34.400> one<00:02:34.700> finger<00:02:35.030> but<00:02:35.240> maybe<00:02:35.450> in

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
difference as one finger but maybe in

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.390 
difference as one finger but maybe in
the<00:02:35.630> future<00:02:35.690> lever<00:02:36.170> also<00:02:36.710> have<00:02:37.010> that<00:02:37.190> feature

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
the future lever also have that feature

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.510 
the future lever also have that feature
and<00:02:38.030> built<00:02:38.330> in<00:02:38.570> and<00:02:38.960> we<00:02:38.990> can<00:02:39.290> go<00:02:39.440> to<00:02:40.430> the

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520

click<00:02:42.620> I<00:02:42.890> had<00:02:43.400> a<00:02:43.430> really<00:02:43.640> hard<00:02:43.670> time<00:02:43.910> finding

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
click I had a really hard time finding

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.970 
click I had a really hard time finding
it<00:02:44.510> before<00:02:44.630> I<00:02:45.110> didn't<00:02:45.560> found<00:02:45.680> it<00:02:45.860> so<00:02:45.950> let's

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
it before I didn't found it so let's

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.920 
it before I didn't found it so let's
just<00:02:46.250> go<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.520> Google<00:02:46.730> search<00:02:47.090> we<00:02:47.600> can<00:02:47.630> just

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
just go to the Google search we can just

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.690 
just go to the Google search we can just
search<00:02:48.080> for<00:02:48.110> Tizen<00:02:48.530> you<00:02:49.130> able<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:49.490> see<00:02:49.610> the

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
search for Tizen you able to see the

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.610 
search for Tizen you able to see the
keyboard<00:02:49.910> before<00:02:50.360> on<00:02:50.570> the<00:02:50.660> bottom<00:02:50.990> which<00:02:51.590> is

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
keyboard before on the bottom which is

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.690 
keyboard before on the bottom which is
quite<00:02:52.070> quick<00:02:52.340> to<00:02:52.610> rotate<00:02:54.160> you<00:02:55.160> can<00:02:55.220> just<00:02:55.490> type

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
quite quick to rotate you can just type

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.470 
quite quick to rotate you can just type
in<00:02:55.910> an<00:02:56.000> address<00:02:56.120> for<00:02:56.450> example

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.430 

go<00:03:03.050> back<00:03:04.810> so<00:03:05.810> as<00:03:05.989> you<00:03:06.080> can<00:03:06.200> see<00:03:06.260> the

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
go back so as you can see the

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.350 
go back so as you can see the
performance<00:03:06.830> is<00:03:06.980> quiet<00:03:07.250> quick<00:03:07.849> and<00:03:08.030> nice<00:03:08.150> but

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
performance is quiet quick and nice but

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.839 
performance is quiet quick and nice but
essentially<00:03:09.230> also<00:03:09.560> just<00:03:10.160> feels<00:03:10.400> like<00:03:10.550> it<00:03:10.730> will

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
essentially also just feels like it will

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.240 
essentially also just feels like it will
be<00:03:10.910> a<00:03:11.239> regular<00:03:11.690> Android<00:03:12.319> device<00:03:12.620> but<00:03:12.950> we<00:03:13.099> have

be a regular Android device but we have

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.860
