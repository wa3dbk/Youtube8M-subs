00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.260
 what is 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.000
 Well, here we have two of the 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.860
 new introductions of sketches for 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.520
 its range of 2015 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:24.580
 this one that we have here would be the cap on 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.349
 his fourth update that good inside 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.509
 of the rallys range of sketches we could 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.369
 say that the most versatile and 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.770
 what we have here would be the gomez 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:36.180
 speed 3 which is a shoe much more 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.180
 oriented to competition 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.000
 in the case of the cap the part that 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.410
 includes a more advanced technology 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.309
 would be the sole that is composed of 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:52.519
 for different types of rooms we have 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.620
 this white 'reality' that is much more 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:58.130
 soft of a large proportion 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.980
 motivation we have this other material 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.960
 of blue color that is a bit harder 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.850
 It will also provide us with something more 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.980
 of grip and durability so what 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.780
 we can find here in the area of ​​the 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.270
 half sole to give face to 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.930
 stability and there are the black areas the 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.630
 areas of greater wear are going to be much 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.060
 harder and they will resist a lot 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.600
 more on the foot 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.280
 On the other hand, the gómez sneaker seems 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.259
 be much more focused on faults and 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.750
 that has a much clearer sole and 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.880
 this clearly favors a better 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.189
 contact in areas of smooth ground either 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.799
 cement was missing or even for 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:38.939
 track training on the other hand the 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:42.100
 cap will have a much more relief 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.829
 pronounced something something deeper and 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.549
 this will allow us to run in zones 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:51.789
 well be it from stone land but 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:54.020
 It is also obviously very useful and with 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.359
 good contact in areas and missing 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.520
 another one of the differences between these two 

00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:00.140
 shoes, they will be clearly 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.640
 also in stability and 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.520
 reactivity that they will provide us 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.209
 we the cap is much more 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.810
 oriented to a long running 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:14.870
 will help us more to cushion the 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.290
 impacts on a long time race 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:21.440
 and on the other hand it is not a shoe 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:25.819
 as reactive as La Gomera we want 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:28.549
 eat less easily is also worth 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.090
 it helps a lot to them this area with a 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.090
 hard plastic 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.590
 Both shoes share their 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.170
 drop feature that is so 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.510
 only 4 millimeters although although with the 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.400
 shadow in 4 will bring us the box one 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.010
 accessory template that what is going to 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.600
 allow is to add if we want a 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.210
 little extra of drop for those 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.860
 runners who prefer a little more 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.860
 of reinforcement that heels much more 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.640
 if they come more shoes have a weight 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.440
 very similar to just above 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.849
 200 grams should also be said that 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.519
 they have it distributed differently 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.319
 when the cap will be centered a bit 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.269
 plus the outer padding in the area 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.519
 middle and back of the foot what will we 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.130
 allow to safely run without 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.170
 socks la gómez will focus a 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.790
 little more in the structure of his sole 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.980
 and the back of the foot to 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.290
 provide us with an extra grip and 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.709
 of course of reactivity to the coast 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:28.880
 of maybe something of harassment we see how 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:30.500
 as the tongue is just barely has 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.330
 two layers of cloth although there was that 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.250
 also say that the zone this zone 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.349
 front is quite narrow what 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.700
 will allow us this game a 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.700
 great support of the foot 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:48.030
 something characteristic also of the great 4 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.890
 this little circuit that is called 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.210
 wifi that will help us place 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.400
 new shoes in a fast way 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.680
 which is a clear wink should lead to 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.470
 the triathlete community in short 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.760
 we could roughly define the uned 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.200
 like a keel shape much more 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.360
 oriented to the speed at 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.120
 competition that takes into account 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.040
 needs of the runner on asphalt and 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.670
 that will provide us with great help 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.530
 of the drive and to get those high 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:18.209
 we are looking for them while 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:20.640
 the cap a shoe more oriented to 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.560
 be a versatile option for all types 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.390
 of runners practically in all types 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.140
 of land and that certainly does not go to 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.140
 disappoint anyone
