batteries located in the trunk on this

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.660 
batteries located in the trunk on this
we're<00:00:48.600> most<00:00:48.780> most<00:00:49.500> eighteenth<00:00:49.950> scale<00:00:50.280> or<00:00:50.460> back

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
we're most most eighteenth scale or back

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.360 
we're most most eighteenth scale or back
there<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.120> there's<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:52.010> shut<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.190> back

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370
