00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.250 

take<00:00:15.160> a<00:00:15.190> look<00:00:15.450> already<00:00:16.450> open<00:00:16.750> this<00:00:16.869> before

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:17.260 
take a look already open this before

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.820 
take a look already open this before
they<00:00:17.890> use<00:00:18.100> it<00:00:18.340> to<00:00:18.490> the<00:00:18.580> last<00:00:18.730> of<00:00:18.940> the<00:00:19.000> day

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.940 

that's<00:00:23.830> not<00:00:23.980> 100%<00:00:24.730> original<00:00:27.450> initial<00:00:28.450> form

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:28.950 
that's not 100% original initial form

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:35.220 
that's not 100% original initial form
but<00:00:29.950> this<00:00:30.160> is<00:00:30.310> the<00:00:30.430> tribe<00:00:30.640> one<00:00:34.020> it's<00:00:35.020> extremely

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
but this is the tribe one it's extremely

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.830 
but this is the tribe one it's extremely
solid<00:00:36.070> I'm<00:00:36.250> assuming<00:00:37.120> that<00:00:37.149> it's<00:00:37.360> exactly<00:00:37.540> the

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
solid I'm assuming that it's exactly the

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.959 
solid I'm assuming that it's exactly the
same<00:00:37.989> quality<00:00:38.530> as<00:00:38.680> it<00:00:38.710> was<00:00:39.040> with<00:00:39.430> the<00:00:39.520> previous

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:39.969 
same quality as it was with the previous

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:40.530 
same quality as it was with the previous
one

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
one

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.389 
one
there's<00:00:41.290> definitely<00:00:41.890> from<00:00:42.250> what<00:00:42.370> I

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:42.399 
there's definitely from what I

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:44.880 
there's definitely from what I
understand<00:00:42.880> some<00:00:43.170> tweaks<00:00:44.170> have<00:00:44.379> been<00:00:44.559> made<00:00:44.739> to

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
understand some tweaks have been made to

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.620 
understand some tweaks have been made to
the<00:00:44.980> design<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:47.010> grip<00:00:48.010> on<00:00:48.280> the<00:00:48.760> legs<00:00:49.120> instead

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:49.630 
the design the grip on the legs instead

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.470 
the design the grip on the legs instead
of<00:00:49.690> foam<00:00:49.990> are<00:00:50.260> now<00:00:50.500> rubber<00:00:51.150> which<00:00:52.150> is<00:00:52.300> nice

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
of foam are now rubber which is nice

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.840 
of foam are now rubber which is nice
it's<00:00:52.720> two<00:00:53.260> of<00:00:53.440> them<00:00:53.560> right<00:00:53.770> here

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
it's two of them right here

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.319 
it's two of them right here
this<00:00:55.390> one<00:00:55.600> has<00:00:55.810> four<00:00:56.020> like<00:00:56.950> sections<00:00:57.610> with

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
this one has four like sections with

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.470 
this one has four like sections with
what's<00:00:58.780> called<00:00:59.020> the<00:00:59.610> quick<00:01:00.610> power<00:01:01.030> locks

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
what's called the quick power locks

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.410 
what's called the quick power locks
which<00:01:02.290> instead<00:01:02.620> of<00:01:02.739> the<00:01:02.829> lever<00:01:03.130> is<00:01:03.460> just<00:01:04.329> a

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
which instead of the lever is just a

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.710 
which instead of the lever is just a
different<00:01:04.809> looking<00:01:05.019> lever<00:01:05.640> they<00:01:06.640> come<00:01:06.820> in<00:01:07.509> and

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
different looking lever they come in and

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.819 
different looking lever they come in and
out<00:01:07.810> like<00:01:08.049> this<00:01:08.229> three<00:01:08.860> levers<00:01:09.100> four<00:01:09.520> legs

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:10.829 
out like this three levers four legs

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:17.069 
out like this three levers four legs
what's<00:01:11.829> neat<00:01:12.159> is<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:13.720> it<00:01:14.200> has<00:01:14.439> a<00:01:15.689> quick<00:01:16.689> link

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:17.079 
what's neat is that it has a quick link

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:19.230 
what's neat is that it has a quick link
or<00:01:17.290> an<00:01:17.380> easy<00:01:17.649> link<00:01:18.009> is<00:01:18.189> what<00:01:18.340> man<00:01:18.490> protocols<00:01:18.999> it

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
or an easy link is what man protocols it

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.389 
or an easy link is what man protocols it
which<00:01:19.780> is<00:01:19.960> a<00:01:19.990> little<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:22.810> is<00:01:22.990> a<00:01:23.020> 3/8<00:01:23.619> threaded

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
which is a little this is a 3/8 threaded

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:27.090 
which is a little this is a 3/8 threaded
hole<00:01:24.880> that<00:01:25.450> allows<00:01:25.479> you<00:01:25.929> to<00:01:26.049> thread<00:01:26.889> some

accessories directly into the body of
the<00:01:29.560> tripod<00:01:30.090> there<00:01:31.090> is<00:01:31.240> a<00:01:31.740> an<00:01:32.740> area<00:01:33.609> right<00:01:33.789> here

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
the tripod there is a an area right here

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.789 
the tripod there is a an area right here
for<00:01:34.329> a<00:01:34.359> hook<00:01:34.630> to<00:01:35.789> weigh<00:01:36.789> it<00:01:36.999> down<00:01:37.030> if<00:01:37.539> necessary

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
for a hook to weigh it down if necessary

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.959 
for a hook to weigh it down if necessary
and<00:01:38.799> the<00:01:39.670> other<00:01:39.819> side<00:01:40.149> of<00:01:40.420> the<00:01:40.709> tripod<00:01:41.709> top<00:01:42.700> is

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:42.969 
and the other side of the tripod top is

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:46.859 
and the other side of the tripod top is
a<00:01:43.560> lever<00:01:44.560> to<00:01:44.770> fasten<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.429> center<00:01:45.729> column<00:01:45.939> the

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
a lever to fasten the center column the

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.919 
a lever to fasten the center column the
center<00:01:47.229> column<00:01:47.439> has<00:01:48.399> the<00:01:48.429> 90<00:01:48.999> degree<00:01:49.119> arm

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
center column has the 90 degree arm

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:51.809 
center column has the 90 degree arm
again<00:01:50.439> there's<00:01:50.950> a<00:01:51.039> little<00:01:51.249> button<00:01:51.549> at<00:01:51.700> the

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
again there's a little button at the

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:54.289 
again there's a little button at the
bottom<00:01:51.939> if<00:01:52.299> you<00:01:52.420> press<00:01:52.659> the<00:01:52.810> button<00:01:53.170> goes<00:01:53.920> up

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
bottom if you press the button goes up

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.399 
bottom if you press the button goes up
over<00:01:55.499> and<00:01:56.499> like<00:01:56.889> this<00:01:57.069> so<00:01:58.139> it's<00:01:59.139> kind<00:01:59.349> of

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
over and like this so it's kind of

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.889 
over and like this so it's kind of
wobbly<00:01:59.799> at<00:01:59.920> this<00:02:00.099> point<00:02:00.429> however<00:02:00.939> when<00:02:01.810> you

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
wobbly at this point however when you

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.410 
wobbly at this point however when you
tighten<00:02:02.289> down<00:02:02.319> the<00:02:02.619> knob<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:04.259> becomes<00:02:05.259> solid

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
tighten down the knob it becomes solid

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.050 
tighten down the knob it becomes solid
there<00:02:07.420> is<00:02:07.599> a<00:02:07.749> bubble<00:02:08.590> level<00:02:09.240> attached<00:02:10.240> to<00:02:10.660> the

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
there is a bubble level attached to the

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.910 
there is a bubble level attached to the
mounting<00:02:13.060> plate<00:02:13.300> which<00:02:14.020> actually<00:02:14.470> rotates

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
mounting plate which actually rotates

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.180 
mounting plate which actually rotates
around<00:02:15.099> so<00:02:15.580> depending<00:02:15.940> on

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
around so depending on

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.700 
around so depending on
how<00:02:16.700> your<00:02:16.910> cameras<00:02:17.480> position<00:02:17.870> you<00:02:18.200> can<00:02:18.350> still

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
how your cameras position you can still

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:24.910 
how your cameras position you can still
see<00:02:18.920> whether<00:02:19.130> your<00:02:19.370> level<00:02:20.270> or<00:02:20.390> not<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:24.470> going

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
see whether your level or not and going

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.150 
see whether your level or not and going
back<00:02:25.130> down<00:02:27.850> all<00:02:28.850> right<00:02:29.110> all<00:02:30.110> three<00:02:30.530> legs<00:02:30.740> have

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
back down all right all three legs have

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.650 
back down all right all three legs have
a<00:02:32.770> lever<00:02:33.770> right<00:02:33.860> here<00:02:34.040> that<00:02:34.940> allows<00:02:34.970> you<00:02:35.450> when

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
a lever right here that allows you when

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.800 
a lever right here that allows you when
you<00:02:35.780> push<00:02:35.990> down<00:02:36.250> have<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.460> legs<00:02:37.700> go<00:02:38.000> on<00:02:38.030> almost

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
you push down have the legs go on almost

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.460 
you push down have the legs go on almost
all<00:02:38.990> the<00:02:39.110> way<00:02:39.230> 90<00:02:39.530> degrees<00:02:39.830> out<00:02:40.480> then<00:02:41.480> first

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
all the way 90 degrees out then first

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.880 
all the way 90 degrees out then first
level<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:43.610> a<00:02:44.120> second<00:02:44.510> level<00:02:44.840> and<00:02:45.200> then<00:02:45.740> the

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
level and a second level and then the

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.640 
level and a second level and then the
third<00:02:46.540> level<00:02:47.540> which<00:02:47.900> is<00:02:48.080> probably<00:02:48.470> going<00:02:48.590> to

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
third level which is probably going to

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.260

this<00:05:10.000> pipe<00:05:10.270> on<00:05:10.510> and<00:05:11.169> hit<00:05:11.380> fitting<00:05:12.370> and<00:05:13.000> a<00:05:13.240> carry

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
this pipe on and hit fitting and a carry

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.320 
this pipe on and hit fitting and a carry
on<00:05:14.520> because<00:05:15.840> sometimes<00:05:16.840> I<00:05:17.110> just<00:05:17.169> go<00:05:17.410> carry<00:05:17.830> on

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
on because sometimes I just go carry on

on because sometimes I just go carry on
so<00:05:19.330> for<00:05:19.630> that<00:05:19.750> purpose<00:05:21.750> illustrate<00:05:22.750> here<00:05:23.590> is

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
so for that purpose illustrate here is

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:29.190 
so for that purpose illustrate here is
the<00:05:23.979> carry<00:05:24.220> on<00:05:24.400> that<00:05:24.580> I<00:05:24.640> think<00:05:24.880> a<00:05:24.910> lot<00:05:28.140> this<00:05:29.140> is

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
the carry on that I think a lot this is

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.590 
the carry on that I think a lot this is
a<00:05:29.620> standard<00:05:30.570> 21<00:05:31.570> inch<00:05:32.010> carry-on<00:05:33.010> that's

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
a standard 21 inch carry-on that's

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.219 
a standard 21 inch carry-on that's

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.469 
overall I would definitely highly
recommend<00:05:54.509> the<00:05:55.289> tripod<00:05:55.740> I<00:05:56.130> got<00:05:57.030> burned<00:05:57.300> by

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
recommend the tripod I got burned by

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:01.129 
recommend the tripod I got burned by
buying<00:05:58.259> a<00:05:58.880> supposedly<00:05:59.880> carbon<00:06:00.449> fiber<00:06:00.750> tripod

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 
buying a supposedly carbon fiber tripod

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:05.029 
buying a supposedly carbon fiber tripod
from<00:06:02.060> South<00:06:03.060> Korea<00:06:03.509> that<00:06:03.840> ended<00:06:04.710> up<00:06:04.800> being

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 
from South Korea that ended up being

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:09.620 
from South Korea that ended up being
really<00:06:05.280> big<00:06:05.520> equality<00:06:06.289> not<00:06:08.030> not<00:06:09.030> not

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
really big equality not not not

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.510 
really big equality not not not
definitely<00:06:10.169> not<00:06:10.350> a<00:06:10.380> quality<00:06:10.800> product<00:06:11.130> and<00:06:11.460> I

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
definitely not a quality product and I

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.490 
definitely not a quality product and I
would<00:06:11.580> not<00:06:11.789> recommend<00:06:11.850> going<00:06:12.539> that<00:06:13.199> you<00:06:13.320> get

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
would not recommend going that you get

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.990 
would not recommend going that you get
what<00:06:13.650> you<00:06:13.740> pay<00:06:13.889> for<00:06:13.919> so<00:06:14.340> I<00:06:14.430> would<00:06:14.580> recommend

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
what you pay for so I would recommend

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.350 
what you pay for so I would recommend
just<00:06:15.180> go<00:06:15.660> ahead<00:06:15.840> and<00:06:16.080> bite<00:06:16.259> the<00:06:16.410> bullet<00:06:16.530> and

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 
just go ahead and bite the bullet and

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.130 
just go ahead and bite the bullet and
getting<00:06:18.360> this<00:06:18.449> tripod<00:06:18.919> that's<00:06:19.919> that
