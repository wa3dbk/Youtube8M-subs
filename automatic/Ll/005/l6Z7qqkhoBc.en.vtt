00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:07.870 
I'm going to put the cylinder on now

this is just the way I do it the area

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.040 
this is just the way I do it the area
where<00:00:13.849> the<00:00:14.000> gasket<00:00:14.330> goes<00:00:14.660> needs<00:00:15.650> to<00:00:15.980> be<00:00:17.050> clean

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
where the gasket goes needs to be clean

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.300 
where the gasket goes needs to be clean
no<00:00:18.590> all<00:00:18.920> no<00:00:19.790> paint<00:00:20.150> no<00:00:20.419> primer<00:00:20.930> that<00:00:21.380> area

needs to be really really really clean
which<00:00:27.740> I<00:00:27.949> just<00:00:28.220> took<00:00:28.460> some<00:00:29.199> lacquer<00:00:30.199> thinner

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
which I just took some lacquer thinner

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.780 
which I just took some lacquer thinner
went<00:00:31.640> around<00:00:31.849> that<00:00:32.180> area<00:00:35.080> the<00:00:36.080> cylinder<00:00:36.790> that

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
went around that area the cylinder that

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.500 
went around that area the cylinder that
we're<00:00:38.030> going<00:00:38.330> to<00:00:38.570> use<00:00:38.870> is<00:00:39.229> this<00:00:39.530> one<00:00:40.059> and<00:00:41.059> I

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
we're going to use is this one and I

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.049 
we're going to use is this one and I
went<00:00:41.750> around<00:00:41.839> with<00:00:42.199> some<00:00:42.559> lacquer<00:00:42.799> thinner<00:00:43.159> to

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
went around with some lacquer thinner to

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:45.450 
went around with some lacquer thinner to

good<00:00:46.460> I<00:00:51.159> could<00:00:52.159> have<00:00:52.190> guessed<00:00:52.460> it<00:00:52.850> and<00:00:53.629> I<00:00:53.930> did

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
good I could have guessed it and I did

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.160 
good I could have guessed it and I did
leave<00:00:54.379> proud<00:00:54.979> around<00:00:55.549> the<00:00:56.030> outside<00:00:56.449> edges<00:00:56.750> and

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
leave proud around the outside edges and

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.979 
leave proud around the outside edges and
I'll<00:00:57.260> show<00:00:57.530> you<00:00:57.559> the<00:00:57.830> reason<00:00:58.010> for<00:00:58.489> that<00:00:58.729> as<00:00:59.119> I

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
I'll show you the reason for that as I

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.100 
I'll show you the reason for that as I
am<00:01:00.199> NOT<00:01:00.500> doing<00:01:01.070> a<00:01:01.900> restoration<00:01:02.900> I<00:01:03.400> am<00:01:04.400> doing<00:01:04.879> a

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.470 
repair if I was new to registration I
would<00:01:09.950> cut<00:01:10.250> the<00:01:10.430> gasket<00:01:11.090> as<00:01:12.850> the<00:01:13.850> factory

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
would cut the gasket as the factory

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.160 
would cut the gasket as the factory
gaskets<00:01:15.260> were<00:01:15.440> die-cut<00:01:16.160> you<00:01:16.840> leave<00:01:17.840> the<00:01:17.990> edge

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
gaskets were die-cut you leave the edge

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.850 
gaskets were die-cut you leave the edge
sticking<00:01:18.710> out<00:01:18.860> on<00:01:19.100> a<00:01:19.130> factory<00:01:19.640> gasket<00:01:20.860> I'm

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
sticking out on a factory gasket I'm

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.610 
sticking out on a factory gasket I'm
gonna<00:01:22.100> put<00:01:22.310> some<00:01:22.520> sealer<00:01:22.940> on<00:01:23.270> all<00:01:23.540> of<00:01:23.720> this<00:01:23.870> and

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
on this Maytag model 92 this is the

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.220 
on this Maytag model 92 this is the
junkyard<00:01:37.820> special<00:01:38.450> engine<00:01:38.870> that<00:01:39.050> we're

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.230 
junkyard special engine that we're

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.880 
junkyard special engine that we're
working<00:01:39.560> with<00:01:39.770> and<00:01:40.040> I<00:01:40.340> did<00:01:40.670> opt<00:01:41.450> to<00:01:42.290> put<00:01:42.530> a<00:01:42.560> new

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
working with and I did opt to put a new

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.950 
working with and I did opt to put a new
set<00:01:43.130> of<00:01:43.159> rings<00:01:43.460> in<00:01:43.760> it<00:01:43.909> because<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.450> cylinder

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
set of rings in it because the cylinder

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.899 
set of rings in it because the cylinder
was<00:01:45.140> so<00:01:45.380> good<00:01:45.650> and<00:01:45.920> if<00:01:46.460> you're<00:01:46.580> going<00:01:46.820> to

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
was so good and if you're going to

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.450 
was so good and if you're going to
rebuild<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:47.479> engine<00:01:47.860> you<00:01:48.860> do<00:01:49.040> need<00:01:49.310> to<00:01:49.400> have

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
rebuild the engine you do need to have

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.430 
rebuild the engine you do need to have
rings<00:01:49.940> in<00:01:50.240> it<00:01:50.360> if<00:01:50.510> you're<00:01:50.690> going<00:01:50.960> to<00:01:51.110> call<00:01:51.229> it

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
rings in it if you're going to call it

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.560 
rings in it if you're going to call it
rebuilt<00:01:51.860> you<00:01:52.220> need<00:01:52.430> to<00:01:52.580> put<00:01:52.760> at<00:01:53.000> least<00:01:53.240> new

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
rebuilt you need to put at least new

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.110 
rebuilt you need to put at least new
rings<00:01:53.900> in<00:01:54.290> it<00:01:54.409> this<00:01:55.250> is<00:01:55.310> definitely<00:01:55.850> a<00:01:55.970> lot<00:01:56.090> of

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
rings in it this is definitely a lot of

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.420 
rings in it this is definitely a lot of
not<00:01:56.570> a<00:01:56.600> restoration<00:01:57.470> but<00:01:57.650> I<00:01:57.680> would<00:01:57.979> like<00:01:58.190> to

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
not a restoration but I would like to

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.360 
not a restoration but I would like to
think<00:01:58.670> it<00:01:58.880> was<00:01:58.909> a<00:01:59.380> rebuilt<00:02:00.380> engine<00:02:00.860> but<00:02:01.040> anyway

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
think it was a rebuilt engine but anyway

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.950 
think it was a rebuilt engine but anyway
you<00:02:01.430> see<00:02:01.700> what<00:02:01.909> I<00:02:01.940> got<00:02:02.030> them<00:02:02.390> positions

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
you see what I got them positions

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.920 
you see what I got them positions
correctly<00:02:03.710> there<00:02:03.979> and<00:02:04.280> this<00:02:05.030> right<00:02:05.330> here<00:02:05.600> is<00:02:05.750> a

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
correctly there and this right here is a

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.199 
correctly there and this right here is a
tin<00:02:06.229> can<00:02:06.650> that<00:02:06.979> I<00:02:07.070> don't<00:02:07.310> cut<00:02:07.610> up<00:02:07.790> you<00:02:08.000> under

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
tin can that I don't cut up you under

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.749 
tin can that I don't cut up you under
and<00:02:08.390> I<00:02:08.840> do<00:02:08.899> got<00:02:09.319> them<00:02:09.530> third<00:02:09.799> ring<00:02:10.099> compressors

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
and I do got them third ring compressors

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.449 
and I do got them third ring compressors
but<00:02:10.970> they<00:02:11.090> just<00:02:11.330> too<00:02:11.540> big<00:02:11.840> and<00:02:12.170> well<00:02:13.069> they<00:02:13.190> cost

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
but they just too big and well they cost

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:14.949 
but they just too big and well they cost
a<00:02:13.670> lot<00:02:13.850> if<00:02:14.000> you're<00:02:14.090> going<00:02:14.330> to<00:02:14.390> go<00:02:14.480> buy<00:02:14.690> one<00:02:14.900> I

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
a lot if you're going to go buy one I

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.110 
a lot if you're going to go buy one I
don't<00:02:15.290> recommend<00:02:15.800> them<00:02:15.920> but<00:02:16.340> be<00:02:16.490> careful<00:02:17.000> if

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
don't recommend them but be careful if

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.070 
don't recommend them but be careful if
you're<00:02:17.270> going<00:02:17.450> to<00:02:17.600> use<00:02:17.750> the

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
you're going to use the

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.010 
you're going to use the
and<00:02:18.260> can<00:02:18.530> method<00:02:19.010> because<00:02:19.310> it's<00:02:19.520> you<00:02:19.940> you<00:02:20.630> are

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
and can method because it's you you are

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.160 
and can method because it's you you are
in<00:02:21.500> danger

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
in danger

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.350 
in danger
so<00:02:24.170> you<00:02:24.890> put<00:02:25.100> that<00:02:25.130> right<00:02:25.520> there<00:02:25.550> right<00:02:26.060> on<00:02:26.090> the

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
so you put that right there right on the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.420 
so you put that right there right on the
other<00:02:26.510> like<00:02:26.750> that

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
other like that
