00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 hi to all the boys and welcome here 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.440
 on elite gaming today for the 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.750
 section dedicated to equipment 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.940
 exotic present investing then of 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.160
 show you the plan c that is a rifle a 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.080
 exotic fusion that I personally have 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.299
 found inside a legendary stalk 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.949
 so what ass without delay let's go 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.570
 immediately to analyze it first of all 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.550
 this fusion rifle will have damage to 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.320
 arc or an electric element in 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.580
 few words will be strong against some 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.500
 types of shields such as 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.029
 those of the knights even before 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.039
 go see the skills I can already 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.080
 tell you that one of the peculiarities one of the 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.510
 strengths of this fusion rifle 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.520
 and threw it because thanks to the plan c 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.280
 you can safely take the 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.620
 aim and kill enemies even 20 30 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.360
 meters away without any problem 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.430
 oh God it is not that every time you aim 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.800
 net you will shoot an enemy far away you will be 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.120
 sure to kill him but taking us 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.129
 just a little, your hand will turn out 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.719
 relatively easy compared to many 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.850
 other fusion rifles 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.070
 also this weapon broberg 2 skills 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.469
 main p a series of sub abilities 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.239
 so to speak multiple choice these 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.430
 Your main skills are fire burns 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.080
 hair that in practice will allow the weapon 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.580
 to be more precise when you shoot 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.250
 from close distances 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.049
 the second one will be plain there and yes 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.700
 calls exactly like the weapon and the 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.890
 his main skill is the one who 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.299
 when you go to change weapons when 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.090
 you will use just that 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.189
 fusion rifle the recharge times of 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.060
 equipment will be reduced and when 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.130
 you're going to shoot the first shot 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.229
 it too will load faster 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.610
 I don't always understand how much 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.200
 time should pass from one time to the next 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.210
 it is nothing more than every time it happens 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.100
 weapon you have this ability because sarah 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.829
 it would be really too unbalanced but 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.329
 once in a while we say so 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.189
 pass use this weapon first 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.020
 hit loads in a second just ed 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.729
 it's really a great skill for a 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.740
 fusion rifle with regards to 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.869
 instead the two under ability the first 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.009
 category the first two because they will go to 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.899
 affect the three parameters 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.159
 mainly namely the stability to the 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.750
 range and impact 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.220
 personally I prefer to concentrate 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.170
 the impact is agitated because of the 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.939
 stability in a rifle the fusion is not there 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.369
 I think it's so relevant anyway 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.960
 I'm not going to shoot from 150 queen meters 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.119
 let's say that in the ten meters good or bad 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.740
 controllable totally accessible 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.869
 in fact, I prefer precisely these 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.210
 regions improve the impact of the impact 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.560
 holding the first park is a bottleneck 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.720
 as for the second one 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.880
 subclass you will have the possibility of 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.620
 decide whether to strengthen the aforementioned 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.150
 enhance stability enhance the 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.040
 recovery is the recharge time 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.540
 personally i'm fine with the 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.250
 second ability or that of the 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.960
 range called forging a 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.880
 hammer and that's what I told you 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.890
 start with a really big advantage 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.630
 raised to the arva making it truly 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.010
 also specifies the twenty thirty meters 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.510
 as usual then there are all the 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.740
 weapon attack upgrades that 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.840
 allow it to reach a maximum 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.060
 of 300 round round bindings 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.070
 moreover this rome plan will have us well 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.330
 then five shots in the magazine 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.250
 conclusion as the plan presents itself 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.690
 there is the plan I really have to admit 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.880
 I'm a fine weapon 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.470
 especially in pvp use this 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.360
 thanks to its main advantage that it is 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.250
 the precision agitated takes from 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.730
 really far away and this is a 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.920
 benefit 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.480
 truly remarkable for a rifle a 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.250
 fusion said this guy the video 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.480
 term entry as usual I invite you to 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.100
 leave me your feedback with 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.110
 empty comment to describe if you didn't have 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.370
 still done and we feel at the 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.370
 next video hi all guys
