gelatin recipe for gelatin which may or
may<00:02:11.670> not<00:02:11.700> involve<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:13.080> liked<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:14.340> idea<00:02:14.790> that

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
may not involve I liked the idea that

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.490 
may not involve I liked the idea that
you<00:02:15.240> might<00:02:15.330> get<00:02:15.630> up<00:02:15.720> pretty<00:02:15.840> close<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:16.320> see

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
you might get up pretty close and see

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.990 
you might get up pretty close and see
little<00:02:16.680> things<00:02:16.980> going<00:02:17.220> on<00:02:17.370> like<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:17.970> know

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
little things going on like you know

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.910 
little things going on like you know
there's<00:02:18.270> so<00:02:18.450> moments<00:02:18.900> of

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.559 

as<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.670> girls<00:02:26.910> go<00:02:27.060> this<00:02:27.240> has<00:02:27.330> been<00:02:27.450> my

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
as the girls go this has been my

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.900 
as the girls go this has been my
favorite<00:02:27.720> process<00:02:28.490> like<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.670> actual

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
favorite process like the actual

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.020 
favorite process like the actual
painting<00:02:30.330> of<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.510> mural<00:02:30.780> is<00:02:30.840> pretty<00:02:31.050> fun<00:02:32.030> but

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
painting of the mural is pretty fun but

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.610 
painting of the mural is pretty fun but
the<00:02:33.150> process<00:02:33.599> of<00:02:33.750> organizing<00:02:34.020> it<00:02:34.590> and

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
the process of organizing it and

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.530 
the process of organizing it and
constructing<00:02:35.220> it<00:02:35.370> is<00:02:35.880> probably<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.390> most

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
constructing it is probably the most

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:51.430 
constructing it is probably the most
exciting<00:02:36.930> part

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.500
