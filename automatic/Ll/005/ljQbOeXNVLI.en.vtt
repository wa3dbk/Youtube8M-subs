00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.889
 this time I will show you how to make a very elegant penalty which 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:12.379
 you can use to find the song very special I hope not 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:13.280
 enjoy 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.379
 we will start by dividing the top part in v 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.439
 and we separated it with a clamp 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.339
 now we will work with the rest of the hair 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:22.369
 in diagonal 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.579
 doing an inverted braid 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:25.830
 we take or mention 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.310
 we divide it into three 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.039
 we are taking one to one of the sections 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.980
 going stronger under 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.010
 and ye pandoras 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.460
 toward the center 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.430
 as we go weaving the braid we are increasing hair 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.610
 from one side of the other here too 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.310
 We will evaluate the three mentions 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.079
 one by one already with increase below and take two towards the center 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.010
 this braid as we see peace remaining on the surface the head 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.010
 and it's going diagonally 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.640
 that we have finished making the date inverted 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.100
 and diagonal 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.810
 we will continue with the upper part that we previously separated 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.390
 and we will be doing father horizontal sections 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.870
 and so we see each note and from the beginning 1010 and a little before the end of the mec 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:28.460
 are 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.430
 so that it lasts longer the crepe or padlock to place lanka in each section 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.950
 that Basque rolling and if you want more volume the top 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.260
 try to take more sections in each direction loading little by little all the 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.010
 hair 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.650
 at the end of the letter the whole top went well the surface of the 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.420
 pp 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.990
 and we apply white more skin is caught before it stays 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.730
 with the aid 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.980
 of tweezers we keep on tutv instead 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.630
 that we are rolling the remaining section of that in such a way that the points 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.530
 we are left to protest 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.870
 moss placing past are your as they are necessary 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.969
 with the help later the tenths of the fingers we will loosen the press 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:18.359
 diagonal little bit until it is in the way another desired mania 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.199
 Similarly 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:41.629
 we roll up the press leaving the tips a little rowdy we apply the cam 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.069
 and finally has removed the clamps 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.069
 we have finally finished 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.819
 I hope you liked it we see them so many of fees to subscribe
