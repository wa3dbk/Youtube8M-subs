 straighten or spine here these 20 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.110
 muscle load too as in the case of 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.329
 trapezius muscles are static but behind 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.670
 a lot of weight 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.469
 strengthen muscles but there is one more 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.270
 exercise is wonderful on straighten 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.670
 or spinal column on the lower back 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.670
 back is called but hyperextension 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:10.080
 is that you straighten 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.760
 your body and just these straighten or 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.180
 work for this you will need two 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.290
 things 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.979
 support any stool sheet and you need 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:24.720
 be fix your legs in given 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:27.170
 case i take a simple chair lie down on 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.170
 support 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:39.000
 fix the case with your feet very important 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:43.200
 to support you decide to 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.619
 you are not lying on her stomach but the same 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.310
 you have a living that is all I am your 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.229
 upper body could have flown in 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.569
 air so that you can here but such 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.270
 incline 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:02:00.119
 further what happens straight legs 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:03.049
 locked hands can be put behind 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:09.259
 one can hold the air of the chest 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:09.259
 the back is straight and begins to rise and the topic 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.130
 horizontal position parallel to 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.780
 quite enough if you have very 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.849
 strong back muscles do you want them even 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:24.569
 more develop can go this 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:28.290
 the edge and do it a little higher went down 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:30.150
 straightened down please avoid 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.709
 rocking in this exercise that is 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.170
 here these are the movements relying on 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.109
 inertia account you need to work your muscles 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.700
 back fix upper position 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:42.269
 seconds feel like they appear 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.540
 burn these muscles go down again and so 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.889
 further as you will 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.459
 you can progress in this exercise 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:51.950
 connect extra weight to it 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:56.480
 have go to the same starting position 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:59.489
 take a gant in your hands and put it down 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.630
 perform the same rise began to feel 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.630
 how violated to clarify 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:11.950
 so with lumbar muscle and all and now 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:13.600
 neck work with neck deal with one thing and 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.250
 simple but can be very easy 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.250
 get hurt so don't overdo it 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:25.270
 cervical what can be divided into 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:29.200
 front lateral and posterior muscles working with 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:34.500
 be it that way at first we work 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:38.620
 the completion of the muscles take two hands 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:43.420
 trample 7 block create artificial 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:46.900
 Give resistance to the Urals and start 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.650
 bending forward overcoming resistance 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.190
 hands 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:56.170
 you feel like a strained neck is not 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:59.080
 you need the back of the same way freely 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:02.410
 and hand resistance is possible in the cross 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:06.640
 lay on the back of the head zadili 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:10.480
 we press on the head and 1 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:14.820
 arm resistance straighten up and again 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.820
 we drop again in the Kremlin 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:22.060
 do the same on the right side 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:26.310
 we rest with one hand first into one 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.910
 side is inclined more and 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.160
 overcome resistance 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.160
 then the same thing the other way 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.580
 it is very important not to overdo it 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.310
 start il load metered 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.900
 gradually feel like giving them your 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.260
 hunger first pressure must be with 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.900
 all of them when accounting for the neck first then 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.280
 pressure may increase 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:54.230
 also the same exercises you need 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:56.380
 do with a simple towel usually 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.050
 towels roll up in any 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:02.660
 worn on the head 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.460
 hold it down if there is 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.230
 the ability to attach to this towel 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.450
 dumbbells of some kind remember on the traction 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:11.900
 can do it the same way 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:16.460
 we fold our heads forward and 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:18.730
 overcoming hand resistance again 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:23.300
 starting to tilt your head back 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:25.750
 running back cervical muscles same 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:30.220
 do with your forehead 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.220
 I will now look like India 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:39.540
 overcoming the resistance of the towel we 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:43.830
 head down raised lowering 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:46.350
 down raise up lower down to 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.790
 sorry with a towel to work with 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.580
 lateral tilt mice 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.770
 I do not recommend it because it is uncomfortable 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:57.200
 can be hurt so god 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.200
 tilt only from hand resistance 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.440
 everything
