00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
of rama's telling me that you had a math

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.680 
of rama's telling me that you had a math
idea<00:00:05.160> certainly<00:00:05.400> tell<00:00:06.029> me<00:00:07.519> how<00:00:08.519> an<00:00:08.849> odd<00:00:09.059> number

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
idea certainly tell me how an odd number

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.039 
idea certainly tell me how an odd number
becomes<00:00:10.170> an<00:00:10.469> even<00:00:10.769> number<00:00:11.370> is<00:00:11.809> every<00:00:12.809> odd

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
becomes an even number is every odd

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.000 
becomes an even number is every odd
number<00:00:13.620> has<00:00:14.250> an<00:00:14.580> amount<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.269> two<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.839> one<00:00:16.590> one

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
number has an amount of two and one one

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.290 
number has an amount of two and one one
you<00:00:18.000> you<00:00:18.600> add<00:00:18.840> two<00:00:19.230> odd<00:00:19.439> numbers<00:00:19.470> together<00:00:20.300> you

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
you you add two odd numbers together you

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.450 
you you add two odd numbers together you
did<00:00:21.539> two<00:00:21.869> separate<00:00:22.350> ones<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.920> they<00:00:23.100> become

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
did two separate ones and they become

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.179 
did two separate ones and they become
the<00:00:23.490> -<00:00:23.820> okay<00:00:24.600> call<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.869> other<00:00:25.260> two<00:00:25.590> them

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
the - okay call the other two them

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.189 
the - okay call the other two them
together<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:27.119> add<00:00:27.300> this<00:00:27.510> two<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.080> you

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
together and you add this two and you

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.679 
together and you add this two and you
get<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.740> answer<00:00:28.980> so<00:00:29.519> what<00:00:29.939> are<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.179> what's

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
get the answer so what are you what's

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.940 
get the answer so what are you what's
idea<00:00:32.750> that<00:00:33.750> when<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.050> add<00:00:34.260> two<00:00:34.649> odd<00:00:34.920> numbers

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
idea that when you add two odd numbers

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.069 
idea that when you add two odd numbers
together<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:36.420> will<00:00:36.570> always<00:00:36.809> be<00:00:38.059> multiple

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
together it will always be multiple

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:40.610 
together it will always be multiple
multiplied<00:00:40.079> by<00:00:40.290> two

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
multiplied by two

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.920 
multiplied by two
how<00:00:41.160> did<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.489> figure<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:41.850> out<00:00:42.000> what<00:00:42.750> we're

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
how did you figure this out what we're

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.270 
how did you figure this out what we're
thinking<00:00:43.140> about<00:00:43.410> when<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:43.800> just<00:00:43.950> figured

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
thinking about when you just figured

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.260 
thinking about when you just figured
this<00:00:44.370> out<00:00:45.950> just<00:00:46.950> playing<00:00:47.340> with<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.700> calculator

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
this out just playing with it calculator

oh okay tell me tell me then if you add
an<00:00:54.930> odd<00:00:55.140> number<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.800> an<00:00:55.890> even<00:00:56.190> number<00:00:56.460> what

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
an odd number to an even number what

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.220 
an odd number to an even number what
will<00:00:56.820> again

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.820

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
the number you add you did to choose

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.539 
the number you add you did to choose
away<00:01:11.000> from<00:01:11.270> the<00:01:11.450> other<00:01:11.600> one<00:01:12.020> do<00:01:12.860> it<00:01:13.100> you<00:01:13.310> take

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
the two away from the odd number first

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.050 
the two away from the odd number first
and<00:01:15.619> add<00:01:15.830> them<00:01:16.070> to<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:16.310> new<00:01:16.460> number

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
and add them to the new number

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.700 
and add them to the new number
what<00:01:17.240> do<00:01:17.299> you<00:01:17.390> get<00:01:17.509> older<00:01:17.690> guys<00:01:17.869> getting<00:01:18.500> all

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
what do you get older guys getting all

what do you get older guys getting all
don't<00:01:19.100> even<00:01:19.759> number<00:01:20.090> of<00:01:20.119> that<00:01:20.540> but<00:01:20.780> then<00:01:20.930> you

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
don't even number of that but then you

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.080 
don't even number of that but then you
have<00:01:21.259> to<00:01:21.290> add<00:01:21.560> one<00:01:21.860> which<00:01:22.130> makes<00:01:22.460> it<00:01:22.670> an<00:01:22.909> odd

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
have to add one which makes it an odd

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.889 
have to add one which makes it an odd
