 also do they are pretty 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:15.530
 fun so let's start 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.570
 your hands and we start 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.150
 these are the ingredients that we are going to 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.710
 need we need a cake that 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.900
 it can be of the taste that you want 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.880
 you can already buy or you can do it 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.920
 if you are not experts in the cakes of 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.960
 these boxes the truth that they do miracles 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.430
 they sell them in all supermarkets and 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.159
 comes the flour the only thing that you have to 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.470
 do is add a cup of water a 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.540
 quarter of oil and three eggs and all 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.190
 you will fight in a bowl then you go to 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.009
 preheat the oven according to the 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.799
 degrees that come behind your house and you go 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.990
 to mix the flour in the bowl and then 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.630
 you are going to add the eggs the oil and 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.679
 the water and you're going to beat everything with a 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:58.100
 blender and since it's all all beaten 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.990
 and be a homogeneous mixture you are going to give yourself 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.450
 a mold and you will grease it with 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.210
 butter and then you are going to add 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.399
 the mix then you're going to put it in 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.950
 oven leaves your cake in the oven for 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.989
 approximately 45 minutes and ready 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.209
 you're going to have a rich fluffy cake and 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.090
 delicious we will also need 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.950
 orange chocolate for frost and 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.840
 this may be the taste that you lose and 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.760
 you will find supermarkets in the 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.440
 Pastry area are very rich and 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.630
 easy to use 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.350
 Pallet sticks can be made of wood or 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.350
 plastic 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:37.230
 color before red only I do not know by 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.270
 what the hell did I put the amber and well let's 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.130
 start by taking our spoon and go 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.560
 to grab the frosty and let's empty it in 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.340
 our cake 2 tablespoons of frosty 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.110
 more or less half forum if it has to be 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.660
 and since we miss it we are going to start 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.910
 crumble the cake and mix everything 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:58.170
 everything all everything until we stay like 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.510
 a tortilla dough or something like that but 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.180
 you are going to see very very delicious then we 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.670
 there has to be something like that and then 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.769
 let's grab a little board where we're going 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.870
 to start making our teams go 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.420
 to grab a little hand a little ball 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.390
 of cake and we're going to start mixing 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.480
 turn around until I know 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.519
 make a little ball and put it in the 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.270
 little board and so we repeat the process with 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.220
 all the laps 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.960
 and that's how all of them are 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.330
 our little balls the truth is that they come out 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.570
 many but they are delicious and you can 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.100
 do all as you prefer and we 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.770
 they have to be all very very very 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.630
 round to make the pallets and 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.760
 well then let's take a plate and 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.900
 let's take the chocolate color 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.550
 orange 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.260
 they have to be orange because the 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.550
 dragon spheres are oranges and the 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.590
 white chocolate can not be put 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.500
 coloring because it gets hard if you touch 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.720
 water or if you touch a dye so 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.810
 It has to be orange and let's get 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.600
 to the micro by intervals of 30 seconds 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.910
 so that it does not burn because if it burns 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.970
 it gets hard too then what 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.430
 we will put 30 seconds to the micro 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.400
 since we do not get out we 're going to beat it very 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.560
 well so that our 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.500
 chocolate with the heat that the 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.830
 plate and we're going to mix everything 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.830
 we can 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.930
 if we are going to have something like that since what 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.480
 we put it back we took it out and beat it 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.790
 we will have something very liquid and 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:39.270
 have to extend then we grab a 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:42.860
 stick and dip it in chocolate to 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.900
 bury it in our cake pop 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.759
 and so we're going to do with all of them 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.419
 all our pretty we are going to put 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:49.419
 the stick 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.629
 and that's how we are left when we have 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.720
 all the sticks in our cake potts 

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:07.940
 then what follows is to mold better 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.129
 the ball to make it more rounded 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.509
 because sometimes they get crushed when the 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:13.970
 you put on the board so the 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:16.520
 We round up a little bit to put them 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.629
 chocolate and cover it knows 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.629
 delicious juices 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.780
 then we were our palette the 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.370
 we immerse in chocolate and with a 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:31.659
 spoon we are helping ourselves so that 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:33.969
 cover the whole palette and mix mix 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:37.229
 let's go and everything to cover 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:37.229
 all very well 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.840
 The next thing we're going to do is 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.820
 remove all the excess chocolate 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.550
 As you can see, a lot is going on a lot 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.380
 and it's because the pallets get pretty 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.360
 chocolate but with this the 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.720
 excess so that they remain very rich and not 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.830
 know nothing more about white chocolate than 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.830
 in this case it is orange 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.290
 and so on until I know there was all the 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:04.810
 chocolate then let's take our 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:07.210
 red dye and a prong tooth and let's go 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.410
 to draw the stars of the spheres 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.360
 dragon 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.790
 You can do this also if you 're not 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.070
 very good drawing or with the 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:17.650
 crafts or things like these you can 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:20.550
 make with chuchitos in the shape of a star 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:24.080
 you are only going to put them before 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.639
 crisis since the chocolate and ready 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.849
 and so you're going to repeat the same 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:30.650
 procedure with each palette and you will 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:33.469
 go adding the stars according to 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:36.349
 wait number are going to be one I'm in 

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:38.120
 one that and two in other three in another 

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:39.949
 four in five others in six others in 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.289
 another and seven in others until completing 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:44.770
 your seven stars and this is our 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:46.419
 final score 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:49.250
 this is all for today I hope 

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:51.190
