like that I figured I'd do a quick
tutorial<00:00:12.719> on<00:00:13.349> when<00:00:13.650> they<00:00:13.740> tell<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:13.980> fruit<00:00:14.219> is

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370

there we go here's one right here off a

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.190 
there we go here's one right here off a
free<00:01:28.650> resolver<00:01:29.130> it's<00:01:29.340> not<00:01:29.640> ripe<00:01:29.970> yet<00:01:30.240> because

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
free resolver it's not ripe yet because

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.960 
free resolver it's not ripe yet because
it's<00:01:31.409> not<00:01:31.590> turning<00:01:32.159> color<00:01:32.400> but<00:01:32.790> it's<00:01:32.909> not

falling off either you can also see the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.660 
falling off either you can also see the
difference<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.790> sizes<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.900> seed<00:01:37.110> pods<00:01:37.670> the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
difference in sizes of the seed pods the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.490 
difference in sizes of the seed pods the
one<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.090> first<00:01:39.810> showed<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:40.079> was<00:01:40.320> about

one that I first showed you was about
the<00:01:40.740> medium<00:01:41.070> size<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.670> second<00:01:42.060> one<00:01:42.150> was<00:01:42.329> a

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
the medium size that second one was a

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.630 
the medium size that second one was a
very<00:01:42.479> large<00:01:42.899> size<00:01:43.200> this<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.040> normal<00:01:44.159> size

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
very large size this is the normal size

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.170 
very large size this is the normal size
fruit<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.210> get<00:01:45.420> off<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.840> free<00:01:46.020> resolver

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
fruit that I get off of free resolver

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.789 
fruit that I get off of free resolver
you<00:01:48.180> know<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.450> all<00:01:48.600> depends<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.200> hybrids

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
you know it all depends on the hybrids

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.740 
you know it all depends on the hybrids
and<00:01:49.950> such<00:01:50.189> like<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:50.880> do<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.570> the

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
water what I like to do is just use my
hands<00:04:41.750> squish<00:04:42.750> them<00:04:42.900> in<00:04:46.340> my<00:04:47.340> camera<00:04:47.760> assistant

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
hands squish them in my camera assistant

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.170 
hands squish them in my camera assistant
here<00:04:48.600> I'll<00:04:48.750> come<00:04:49.350> in<00:04:49.530> right<00:04:49.830> where<00:04:50.040> the<00:04:50.190> seeds

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
here I'll come in right where the seeds

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.770 
here I'll come in right where the seeds
are<00:04:51.800> you<00:04:52.800> can<00:04:52.950> see<00:04:53.100> exactly<00:04:53.460> what<00:04:53.820> happens<00:04:54.180> the

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
are you can see exactly what happens the

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.390 
are you can see exactly what happens the
seeds<00:04:55.020> actually<00:04:55.440> separate<00:04:55.890> from<00:04:55.920> the<00:04:56.190> pulp

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
seeds actually separate from the pulp

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.500 
seeds actually separate from the pulp
really<00:04:56.940> nicely<00:04:57.180> so<00:04:58.820> what<00:04:59.820> you<00:04:59.940> do<00:05:00.090> is<00:05:00.240> if<00:05:00.390> you

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
really nicely so what you do is if you

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.180 
really nicely so what you do is if you
squeeze<00:05:01.080> and<00:05:01.590> squeeze<00:05:01.860> and<00:05:02.570> get<00:05:03.570> all<00:05:03.930> of<00:05:04.860> the

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
squeeze and squeeze and get all of the

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.640 
squeeze and squeeze and get all of the
seeds<00:05:05.460> that<00:05:05.760> you<00:05:05.940> can<00:05:06.590> out<00:05:07.590> of<00:05:07.919> the<00:05:08.340> pulp<00:05:08.550> and

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
seeds that you can out of the pulp and

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.220 
seeds that you can out of the pulp and
you<00:05:10.650> can<00:05:10.800> sit<00:05:11.010> there<00:05:11.040> to<00:05:11.250> take<00:05:11.430> out<00:05:11.550> the<00:05:11.700> pulp

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
you can sit there to take out the pulp

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.409 
you can sit there to take out the pulp
as<00:05:13.230> needed<00:05:13.740> the<00:05:14.430> seeds<00:05:14.669> will<00:05:14.880> actually<00:05:15.240> drop

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
as needed the seeds will actually drop

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:19.340 
as needed the seeds will actually drop
to<00:05:15.630> the<00:05:15.750> bottom<00:05:15.900> the<00:05:16.680> pulp<00:05:16.919> if<00:05:17.190> you<00:05:18.169> play<00:05:19.169> with

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
to the bottom the pulp if you play with

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.890 
to the bottom the pulp if you play with
it<00:05:19.500> long<00:05:19.650> enough<00:05:20.210> will<00:05:21.210> actually<00:05:21.540> float<00:05:21.750> to

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
it long enough will actually float to

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:28.010 
it long enough will actually float to
the<00:05:21.930> top<00:05:22.669> cool<00:05:25.550> so<00:05:26.550> you<00:05:27.120> just<00:05:27.300> keep<00:05:27.480> on<00:05:27.690> doing

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
the top cool so you just keep on doing

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.330 
the top cool so you just keep on doing
that<00:05:28.050> make<00:05:28.410> sure<00:05:28.560> you<00:05:28.650> get<00:05:28.770> all<00:05:28.919> your<00:05:28.950> seeds

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
that make sure you get all your seeds

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.170 
that make sure you get all your seeds
because<00:05:29.669> every<00:05:30.060> seed<00:05:30.360> is<00:05:30.630> different<00:05:31.080> and<00:05:32.180> some

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
because every seed is different and some

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.460 
because every seed is different and some
of<00:05:33.300> this<00:05:33.450> you're<00:05:33.780> just<00:05:34.050> going<00:05:34.200> to<00:05:34.260> have<00:05:34.410> to

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
of this you're just going to have to

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.230 
of this you're just going to have to
keep<00:05:34.740> going<00:05:36.230> and<00:05:37.580> after<00:05:38.580> you<00:05:38.760> get<00:05:38.910> all<00:05:39.120> your

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
keep going and after you get all your

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.060 
keep going and after you get all your
pulp<00:05:39.480> out<00:05:39.690> then<00:05:39.960> I'll<00:05:40.080> show<00:05:40.320> you<00:05:40.350> what<00:05:40.500> next<00:05:40.950> to

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
pulp out then I'll show you what next to

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.560 
pulp out then I'll show you what next to
do<00:05:43.190> okay<00:05:44.190> so<00:05:44.520> after<00:05:44.669> you<00:05:44.820> do<00:05:44.970> that<00:05:45.000> you<00:05:45.330> got<00:05:45.480> to

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
do okay so after you do that you got to

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.500 
do okay so after you do that you got to
get<00:05:45.660> the<00:05:45.750> seeds<00:05:45.990> out<00:05:46.200> with<00:05:47.010> the<00:05:47.130> water<00:05:47.510> this

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
get the seeds out with the water this

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.590 
get the seeds out with the water this
thing<00:05:48.570> I<00:05:48.960> have<00:05:49.080> found<00:05:49.350> is<00:05:49.710> using<00:05:50.460> a<00:05:50.490> coffee<00:05:51.240> cup

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
thing I have found is using a coffee cup

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.360 
thing I have found is using a coffee cup
and

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.930 

a<00:05:54.600> paper<00:05:55.600> towel<00:05:55.960> and<00:05:56.590> just<00:05:56.889> slowly<00:05:57.220> pour<00:05:57.910> the

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
a paper towel and just slowly pour the

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:06.840 
a paper towel and just slowly pour the
water<00:05:58.300> in

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:13.440 

maybe<00:06:07.390> water<00:06:07.600> will<00:06:07.840> actually<00:06:10.500> settle<00:06:11.500> out<00:06:12.450> may

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:13.450 
maybe water will actually settle out may

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:20.410 
maybe water will actually settle out may
need<00:06:13.630> to<00:06:13.750> agitate<00:06:13.870> it<00:06:14.380> just<00:06:14.590> a<00:06:14.680> little<00:06:14.830> bit

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:20.420 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.660 

but<00:06:21.020> then<00:06:21.170> you<00:06:21.260> just<00:06:21.470> pour<00:06:21.680> them<00:06:21.770> out<00:06:21.890> and<00:06:22.460> then

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:22.670 
but then you just pour them out and then

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.730 
but then you just pour them out and then
you<00:06:22.700> put<00:06:22.940> them<00:06:23.000> on<00:06:23.150> another<00:06:23.480> paper<00:06:23.690> towel<00:06:23.960> and

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 
you put them on another paper towel and

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.650 
you put them on another paper towel and
you<00:06:24.830> let<00:06:25.010> them<00:06:25.100> dry<00:06:25.340> and<00:06:26.030> after<00:06:26.360> you<00:06:26.450> let<00:06:26.570> them

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:26.660 
you let them dry and after you let them

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.540 
you let them dry and after you let them
dry<00:06:26.870> you<00:06:27.200> can<00:06:27.230> either<00:06:27.560> sew<00:06:27.830> them<00:06:27.950> right<00:06:28.160> there

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550 
dry you can either sew them right there

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.420 
dry you can either sew them right there
or<00:06:29.210> you<00:06:29.660> can<00:06:29.810> just<00:06:29.990> let<00:06:30.530> them<00:06:30.650> dry<00:06:30.830> for<00:06:31.100> spring

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.430 
or you can just let them dry for spring

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.990 
or you can just let them dry for spring
and<00:06:31.640> I<00:06:31.910> plan<00:06:32.150> to<00:06:32.180> do<00:06:32.420> it<00:06:32.510> for<00:06:32.690> spring<00:06:32.990> because

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 
and I plan to do it for spring because

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.240 
and I plan to do it for spring because
if<00:06:35.000> you<00:06:35.150> take<00:06:35.330> a<00:06:35.390> look<00:06:35.600> outside<00:06:35.750> I<00:06:36.290> don't<00:06:36.950> think

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.250
