playing against another team the speed
of<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.070> game<00:01:53.100> so<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:54.450> was<00:01:54.630> good<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.140> also

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
of the game so that was good and I also

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.740 
of the game so that was good and I also
thought<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:55.799> our<00:01:56.100> starters<00:01:56.640> didn't<00:01:57.479> have<00:01:57.600> to

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
thought that our starters didn't have to

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.630 
thought that our starters didn't have to
play<00:01:57.930> heavy<00:01:58.140> minutes<00:01:58.290> tonight<00:01:58.890> near<00:01:59.189> UCLA

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
in between our game on Saturday we only

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.920 
in between our game on Saturday we only
have<00:02:04.740> one<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.579> fact<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:05.939> we<00:02:06.090> didn't<00:02:06.329> get

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930
