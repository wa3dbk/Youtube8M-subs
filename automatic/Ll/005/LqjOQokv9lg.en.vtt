and now I'm gonna do just this section

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:39.869 
and now I'm gonna do just this section
last<00:06:37.750> I<00:06:38.500> just<00:06:38.889> wanted<00:06:39.099> to<00:06:39.189> show<00:06:39.400> you<00:06:39.430> guys<00:06:39.580> real

00:06:39.869 --> 00:06:39.879 
last I just wanted to show you guys real

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:41.309 
last I just wanted to show you guys real
quick<00:06:39.909> what<00:06:40.210> it<00:06:40.300> actually<00:06:40.509> looks<00:06:40.930> like<00:06:41.050> it's

00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:41.319 
quick what it actually looks like it's

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:46.080 
quick what it actually looks like it's
like<00:06:41.439> a<00:06:41.500> s<00:06:42.120> like<00:06:43.120> that<00:06:43.360> and<00:06:44.580> so<00:06:45.580> that's<00:06:45.729> why<00:06:45.909> I

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.090 
like a s like that and so that's why I

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:50.189 
like a s like that and so that's why I
think<00:06:46.180> it's<00:06:46.479> called<00:06:46.689> the<00:06:46.750> S<00:06:46.900> wave<00:06:47.969> and<00:06:49.199> that's

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:50.199 
think it's called the S wave and that's

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:52.320 
think it's called the S wave and that's
all<00:06:50.349> you<00:06:50.469> do<00:06:50.590> to<00:06:50.800> move<00:06:50.919> it<00:06:51.069> down<00:06:51.099> just<00:06:51.909> kind<00:06:52.300> of

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330 
all you do to move it down just kind of

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.480 
all you do to move it down just kind of
slide<00:06:52.629> it<00:06:52.780> you<00:06:53.710> don't<00:06:53.860> really<00:06:53.949> need<00:06:54.129> to<00:06:54.190> open

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.490 
slide it you don't really need to open

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:59.219 
slide it you don't really need to open
it<00:06:54.900> okay<00:06:55.900> so<00:06:55.960> after<00:06:56.590> you<00:06:56.740> have<00:06:57.009> it<00:06:57.159> all<00:06:57.340> done<00:06:58.229> I

people like to brush it
I<00:07:06.090> don't<00:07:07.090> know<00:07:07.210> so<00:07:07.599> um<00:07:09.629> I<00:07:11.219> can't<00:07:12.219> buy<00:07:12.310> my

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.370 
I don't know so um I can't buy my

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.100 
I don't know so um I can't buy my
teasing<00:07:12.639> brush<00:07:12.909> and<00:07:13.330> that's<00:07:13.449> pretty<00:07:13.810> tragic

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:14.110 
teasing brush and that's pretty tragic

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:16.700 
teasing brush and that's pretty tragic
because<00:07:14.529> it<00:07:14.830> needs<00:07:15.009> to<00:07:15.219> be<00:07:15.370> teased<00:07:15.669> up<00:07:16.000> here

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:16.710 
because it needs to be teased up here

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:28.200 
because it needs to be teased up here
but<00:07:21.960> so<00:07:23.370> once<00:07:24.370> you<00:07:24.819> finished<00:07:26.430> that<00:07:27.430> then<00:07:28.000> you

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:28.210 
but so once you finished that then you

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.529 
but so once you finished that then you
can<00:07:28.449> style<00:07:28.900> it<00:07:29.199> uh<00:07:29.529> I<00:07:29.650> gotta<00:07:30.610> go<00:07:30.819> hunt<00:07:31.150> for<00:07:31.270> my

00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:31.539 
can style it uh I gotta go hunt for my

00:07:31.539 --> 00:07:36.360 
can style it uh I gotta go hunt for my
teasing<00:07:32.169> brush<00:07:33.750> so<00:07:34.750> that's<00:07:35.620> how<00:07:35.860> I<00:07:35.889> did<00:07:36.219> my

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:36.370 
teasing brush so that's how I did my

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.790 
teasing brush so that's how I did my
hair<00:07:36.639> for<00:07:36.699> the<00:07:37.029> Super<00:07:37.360> Bowl<00:07:37.509> for<00:07:37.810> the<00:07:38.589> most

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:38.800 
hair for the Super Bowl for the most

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.649 
hair for the Super Bowl for the most
part<00:07:40.650> it<00:07:41.650> will<00:07:41.860> soften<00:07:42.190> and<00:07:42.580> and<00:07:43.029> a<00:07:43.240> little<00:07:43.479> bit

00:07:43.649 --> 00:07:43.659 
part it will soften and and a little bit

00:07:43.659 --> 00:07:48.209 
part it will soften and and a little bit
it's<00:07:44.560> pretty<00:07:45.159> harsh<00:07:45.430> right<00:07:45.669> now<00:07:45.819> but<00:07:47.069> you<00:07:48.069> know

00:07:48.209 --> 00:07:48.219 
it's pretty harsh right now but you know

00:07:48.219 --> 00:07:50.339 
it's pretty harsh right now but you know
that's<00:07:48.759> how<00:07:48.940> I<00:07:48.969> did<00:07:49.089> it<00:07:49.210> in<00:07:49.990> case<00:07:50.169> you<00:07:50.259> were

00:07:50.339 --> 00:07:50.349
