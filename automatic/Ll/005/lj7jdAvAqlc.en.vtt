00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.319
 do not 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.240
 crytek has already released the closed beta 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.060
 of war face the shooter in first 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:22.000
 exclusive free to play person for pc and 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.070
 xbox 360 waiting for the release 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.560
 official in a few months we have already 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.840
 could taste a little what we 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.090
 will offer this new production of 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.180
 German developer studio created by 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:37.390
 the earth brothers this beta we have 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.750
 tested on xbox 360 and it cost us 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.480
 horrors download it because of the 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.220
 servers a whole day and a half to 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.950
 download the 5 gigas that occupies this 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.300
 beta before jumping into action a 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.950
 tutorial offers us all the 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.980
 possibilities that the class allows 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.640
 soldier and sniper 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.770
 customizing it with the 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.160
 appearance that we want unlocking 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.900
 others as we achieve success we are 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.899
 propose two game modes one 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.729
 cooperative and another competitive in the 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:08.890
 first we find general visions 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.630
 that we can overcome when we want and 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.210
 others that will be proposed every day by 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.999
 crytek in those games for up to 5 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.679
 players we should go from point a to b in 

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:18.890
 scenes full of enemies that 

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:21.290
 they attack everywhere 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.170
 as soldiers we must get to the point of 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.790
 collection is not mandatory to finish 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.430
 with all the basic enemies for 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.190
 fulfill the missions divided each 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.970
 in two areas that we arrived at and from 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.240
 that we are leaving 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.009
 He gave us permission to shoot himself 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.890
 to the enemies that we see by the 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.600
 windows in the cooperative beta we have 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.000
 could try several easy missions 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.890
 several stockings and a hardcore the 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.630
 difficulty is not only that 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.210
 we advance the enemies know for 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.800
 tighten up better but we also go 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.229
 meeting with soldiers with 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.550
 armor soldiers with shield 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.640
 juggernauts launcher rocket turrets 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.500
 enemy armored etcetera necks 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.590
 bottle areas of various access corridors 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.369
 narrow passages with various heights 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.200
 well we have seen a variety 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.869
 interesting of situations to be a 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.220
 beta have a slight idea of ​​where 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.940
 the shots will go when available 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.220
 for everyone is fried we can resurrect 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.010
 to classmates as well as using coins 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.510
 to resurrect ourselves the 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.550
 which we will get with the 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.470
 experience gained or buying the 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.570
 directly 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.520
 to which one of the members crosses each 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.220
 one of the texts distributed by the 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.670
 I walk all the dead companions 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.740
 will resurrect again automatically 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.840
 like all fruit play there are a lot of 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.030
 objects weapons coins and accessories that 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.069
 buy and even if we are in a beta 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.950
 There are quite a few proposals to buy with 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.450
 real money to improve as a player 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.250
 still indicate that we are not even though a 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.440
 peyton win being able to play almost 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.690
 quietly without spending money the 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.940
 customization of weapons is high 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.520
 We have been able to modify only some 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.010
 basic aspects not many of each 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.260
 of them the modification of weapons is 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.300
 done in gray style 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.310
 that is, each weapon presents different 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.980
 Improvable parts assigned to the 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.560
 buttons of the pack the other offer that 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.269
 we find is the competitive both in 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.400
 game all against all on a map 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.470
 half as a match per team with 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.269
 small maps the experience of 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.459
 competitive warface we thought 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.370
 too different something usual in 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.080
 crater as something looser to be a 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.660
 competitive and has lacked a bit more than 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.850
 hook and areas with more chances of 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.590
 face to every kind of soldier 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.350
 one just wanders from one place to another 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.320
 and there are too few areas where 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.609
 get an advantage in front of the rival both 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.590
 team maps have seemed to us 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.810
 too flat 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.810
 with scarce circuits by which 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.400
 move us the used cry engine does not squeeze 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.010
 the graphic possibilities offered 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.830
 xbox 360 for example getting alone 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.269
 moments of brilliance 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.260
 visually crytek can give much more 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.940
 of itself 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.860
 correct buildings almost null 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.470
 destruction of the environment enemies something 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.810
 fuzzy textures or greater 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.910
 fluency of play in both modes that 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.040
 you can demand it and it's because of this 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.590
 study that has amazed us during 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.959
 years with many of his productions 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.579
 the sound is correct without presenting anything 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.739
 highlight 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:17.959
 we are facing a beta this means that 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.820
 many things can be improved between 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.639
 are those mentioned a few seconds ago 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.080
 that the responsos sometimes put us in the 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.120
 throat of the wolf without us 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.430
 seconds to escape and backs by 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.190
 everywhere where the dead as they float 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:34.010
 even in the air at the moment war fish 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.260
 has captured our curiosity but not 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:39.650
 our hours of play we liked 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.600
 plus the cooperative that the competido is 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.520
 possible that we throw a game 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.240
 more to the game and we'll see a pot of 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.650
 trust 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.050
 to this proposal 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.639
 that we hope will be much more explosive in 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.400
 how much is completely available 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:55.340
 we have hopes placed in 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:05:00.430
 him but for the moment it has been rather 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.430
 a bluf a pretty loose product
