well I think he'll be better off a
stronger<00:01:04.500> pace<00:01:04.710> go<00:01:05.040> quicker<00:01:05.339> ground<00:01:05.670> again

pulled<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.900> bit<00:01:07.020> hard<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.290> begin<00:01:07.619> with<00:01:07.740> but<00:01:07.860> I

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
think you'll be more settled when you

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.320 
think you'll be more settled when you
know<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> better<00:01:10.860> race<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.520> yeah<00:01:11.880> he's<00:01:12.090> got<00:01:12.240> to

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
going on clear of flex and flair and

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.679 
going on clear of flex and flair and
what<00:01:44.399> did<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.640> make<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.820> rocky<00:01:45.210> queex

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
what did you make of rocky queex

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.649 
what did you make of rocky queex
performance<00:01:46.380> he's<00:01:46.590> now<00:01:46.770> 14<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.700> 14<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.180> RSA

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
performance he's now 14 to 14 the RSA

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.260 
performance he's now 14 to 14 the RSA
chase<00:01:48.979> yeah<00:01:49.979> right<00:01:50.189> Rocky<00:01:50.430> creepy<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:51.030> think

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
chase yeah right Rocky creepy I think

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.760 
chase yeah right Rocky creepy I think
you<00:01:51.329> could<00:01:51.479> put<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.750> your<00:01:51.869> jumper<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.500> like<00:01:52.649> the

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
you could put it your jumper I like the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.340 
you could put it your jumper I like the
way<00:01:52.860> jumps<00:01:53.310> he'll<00:01:53.490> stay<00:01:53.729> very<00:01:53.970> well<00:01:54.350> once

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
way jumps he'll stay very well once

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.130 
way jumps he'll stay very well once
again<00:01:55.560> he's<00:01:55.799> another<00:01:55.979> one<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.159> those<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:57.140> I'd

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
again he's another one of those that I'd

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.440 
again he's another one of those that I'd
expect<00:01:58.680> something<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.100> just<00:01:59.280> participate<00:01:59.520> too

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
expect something to just participate too

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.760 
expect something to just participate too
good<00:02:00.659> for<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:00.960> thought<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.110> don't<00:02:01.350> really<00:02:01.590> see

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
good for I thought I don't really see

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.620 
good for I thought I don't really see
him<00:02:02.070> as<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.219> gold<00:02:02.430> cup<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.790> horse<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.210> future

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
him as a gold cup of horse of the future

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.850 
him as a gold cup of horse of the future
and<00:02:03.689> that's<00:02:03.780> normally<00:02:04.229> what<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.439> takes<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.829> win

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
and that's normally what it takes to win

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.029 
and that's normally what it takes to win
the<00:02:05.420> RSA<00:02:06.420> but<00:02:06.659> he's<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.079> good<00:02:07.259> solid<00:02:07.500> horse<00:02:07.829> will

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
the RSA but he's a good solid horse will

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.830 
the RSA but he's a good solid horse will
be<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.190> good<00:02:08.670> staying<00:02:08.940> handicapper<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.599> think

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
be a good staying handicapper I think

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.180 
be a good staying handicapper I think
maybe<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.080> little<00:02:10.229> bit<00:02:10.379> better<00:02:10.530> than<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:10.739> and

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
maybe a little bit better than that and

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.070 
maybe a little bit better than that and
any<00:02:11.340> others<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.910> make<00:02:12.030> a<00:02:12.090> note<00:02:12.390> of<00:02:12.420> with<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.840> view

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
any others to make a note of with a view

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.730 
any others to make a note of with a view
to<00:02:13.230> tell

twiston-davies<00:02:17.820> it's<00:02:18.510> also<00:02:18.690> thought<00:02:18.930> he

looked<00:02:19.230> really<00:02:19.470> good<00:02:19.740> I<00:02:19.920> think<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:20.760> know<00:02:20.840> the

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
looked really good I think you know the

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.300 
looked really good I think you know the

type of horse it could go ill in the

its by Galileo so I wouldn't be

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
Kempton I mean he absolutely cruised

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.790 
Kempton I mean he absolutely cruised
home<00:02:38.190> he<00:02:38.460> did<00:02:38.670> he's<00:02:39.450> obviously<00:02:39.810> an<00:02:40.200> improving

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
home he did he's obviously an improving

horse hadn't aware some sort of race
he'll<00:02:42.930> go<00:02:43.140> for<00:02:43.670> but<00:02:44.670> he<00:02:44.760> could<00:02:44.910> be<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.090> sort<00:02:45.270> of

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
he'll go for but he could be the sort of

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.610 
he'll go for but he could be the sort of
horse<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.600> look<00:02:45.720> out<00:02:45.840> for<00:02:45.870> in<00:02:46.140> a<00:02:46.170> handicap

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
horse to look out for in a handicap

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.170 
horse to look out for in a handicap
maybe<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:46.920> cold<00:02:47.160> cup<00:02:47.400> of<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.700> gel<00:02:48.030> and

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
maybe the cold cup of the gel and

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.300 
maybe the cold cup of the gel and
festival<00:02:48.570> might<00:02:48.720> be<00:02:48.870> his<00:02:49.020> race<00:02:49.230> so<00:02:49.500> be<00:02:50.280> a

festival might be his race so be a

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.650 
festival might be his race so be a
