00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
original video I said that all of the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.560 
original video I said that all of the
lights<00:01:19.700> turn<00:01:20.119> off<00:01:20.619> well<00:01:21.619> it<00:01:22.070> turns<00:01:22.520> out<00:01:22.820> I<00:01:23.119> was

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
lights turn off well it turns out I was

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.870 
lights turn off well it turns out I was
wrong<00:01:23.990> about<00:01:24.200> that<00:01:24.350> because<00:01:25.040> I<00:01:25.310> rarely<00:01:25.520> used

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
wrong about that because I rarely used

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.480 
wrong about that because I rarely used
this<00:01:26.060> but<00:01:26.619> the<00:01:27.619> radio<00:01:28.549> controls<00:01:29.860> the<00:01:30.860> DI<00:01:31.070> sea

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
this but the radio controls the DI sea

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.620 
this but the radio controls the DI sea
and<00:01:31.940> steering<00:01:32.330> wheel<00:01:32.479> controls<00:01:32.930> and<00:01:34.630> of

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
and steering wheel controls and of

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.399 
and steering wheel controls and of
course<00:01:35.840> window<00:01:36.140> controls<00:01:36.530> were<00:01:36.770> still<00:01:37.039> on<00:01:38.409> now

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
course window controls were still on now

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.859 
course window controls were still on now
of<00:01:39.649> course<00:01:39.860> in<00:01:40.610> order<00:01:40.789> to<00:01:40.970> alleviate<00:01:41.840> that

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
of course in order to alleviate that

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:50.580 
of course in order to alleviate that
problem<00:01:42.380> I<00:01:42.830> can<00:01:43.610> just<00:01:43.880> use<00:01:44.659> the<00:01:47.649> the<00:01:48.649> in<00:01:48.830> -<00:01:49.210> the

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
problem I can just use the the in - the

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.130 
problem I can just use the the in - the
