3,000 for elite that seems to be a
little<00:02:24.150> better<00:02:24.629> it<00:02:24.930> may<00:02:25.050> be<00:02:25.140> it'll<00:02:25.230> take<00:02:25.379> you

domination or hardpoint non-stop just

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.630 
domination or hardpoint non-stop just
going<00:02:30.870> for<00:02:31.019> kills<00:02:31.260> you'll<00:02:31.890> eventually<00:02:32.220> get

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
going for kills you'll eventually get

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.250 
going for kills you'll eventually get
the<00:02:32.790> weapon<00:02:33.060> but<00:02:33.599> that's<00:02:33.780> who<00:02:33.900> I<00:02:33.930> mean<00:02:34.110> that

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
the weapon but that's who I mean that

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.660 
the weapon but that's who I mean that
doesn't<00:02:34.620> seem<00:02:34.830> like<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.069> way<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.430> go<00:02:35.640> I

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
doesn't seem like the way to go I

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.830 
doesn't seem like the way to go I
wouldn't<00:02:36.030> want<00:02:36.180> to<00:02:36.269> do<00:02:36.360> that<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:36.540> would

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
wouldn't want to do that I would

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.050 
wouldn't want to do that I would
definitely<00:02:37.080> not<00:02:37.680> want<00:02:37.739> to<00:02:38.099> spend<00:02:38.700> my<00:02:38.849> life

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
definitely not want to spend my life

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.970 
definitely not want to spend my life
getting<00:02:39.480> three<00:02:39.750> thousand<00:02:40.170> kills<00:02:40.440> a<00:02:40.650> certain

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
getting three thousand kills a certain

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.800 
getting three thousand kills a certain
weapon<00:02:41.250> just<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:41.730> get<00:02:42.000> an<00:02:42.120> elite<00:02:42.360> version<00:02:42.720> of

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
weapon just to get an elite version of

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.520 
weapon just to get an elite version of
it<00:02:42.930> so<00:02:43.849> maybe<00:02:44.849> there's<00:02:45.090> another<00:02:45.450> way<00:02:45.540> maybe

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
it so maybe there's another way maybe

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.960 
it so maybe there's another way maybe
you<00:02:46.739> need<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:46.920> play<00:02:47.220> with<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.489> weapon<00:02:47.760> in<00:02:47.849> a

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
you need to play with the weapon in a

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.610 
you need to play with the weapon in a
game<00:02:48.150> mode<00:02:48.330> for<00:02:48.360> a<00:02:48.569> certain<00:02:48.900> period<00:02:49.110> of<00:02:49.319> time

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
game mode for a certain period of time

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.370 
game mode for a certain period of time
so<00:02:49.980> maybe<00:02:50.610> you<00:02:50.819> have<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.120> play<00:02:51.299> with<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.660> ball

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
so maybe you have to play with the ball

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.210 
so maybe you have to play with the ball
27<00:02:53.099> in<00:02:53.310> domination<00:02:53.880> 4<00:02:54.440> hmm<00:02:55.530> let's<00:02:55.680> say<00:02:55.920> five

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
27 in domination 4 hmm let's say five

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.850 
27 in domination 4 hmm let's say five
hours<00:02:56.730> in<00:02:57.030> order<00:02:57.299> to<00:02:57.450> unlock<00:02:57.569> a<00:02:58.079> certain<00:02:58.709> type

hours in order to unlock a certain type

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.830 
hours in order to unlock a certain type
of<00:02:58.890> it<00:02:59.130> maybe<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.430> professional<00:03:00.090> but<00:03:00.720> then

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
of it maybe the professional but then

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.080 
of it maybe the professional but then
again<00:03:00.959> five<00:03:01.319> hours<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.799> domination<00:03:02.250> I'll<00:03:02.579> uh<00:03:02.700> I

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
again five hours of domination I'll uh I

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.780 
again five hours of domination I'll uh I
don't<00:03:03.329> know<00:03:03.569> it<00:03:03.870> doesn't<00:03:04.530> seem<00:03:04.709> like<00:03:04.890> a<00:03:04.920> lot<00:03:05.160> so

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
don't know it doesn't seem like a lot so

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.430 
don't know it doesn't seem like a lot so
it's<00:03:06.209> kind<00:03:06.450> of<00:03:06.510> hard<00:03:06.810> you're<00:03:06.959> thinking<00:03:07.290> like

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
it's kind of hard you're thinking like

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.500 
it's kind of hard you're thinking like
how<00:03:07.680> could<00:03:07.890> you<00:03:08.069> earn<00:03:08.310> this<00:03:08.579> where<00:03:09.120> it<00:03:09.239> won't

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
how could you earn this where it won't

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.420 
how could you earn this where it won't
be<00:03:09.660> too<00:03:09.870> easy<00:03:10.110> and<00:03:10.380> everyone<00:03:10.920> will<00:03:11.069> have<00:03:11.220> it

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
be too easy and everyone will have it

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.880 
be too easy and everyone will have it
but<00:03:11.970> in<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.540> hard<00:03:12.900> way<00:03:13.079> that<00:03:13.290> will<00:03:13.440> not<00:03:13.470> take

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
but in the hard way that will not take

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.430 
but in the hard way that will not take
too<00:03:14.069> much<00:03:14.190> time<00:03:14.480> maybe<00:03:15.480> you<00:03:15.690> could<00:03:15.840> trade<00:03:16.290> it

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
good and instead of my instead of

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.459 
good and instead of my instead of
leveling<00:04:30.419> up<00:04:30.569> you're<00:04:30.689> gonna<00:04:30.780> use<00:04:31.050> it<00:04:31.199> to<00:04:31.319> buy

00:04:31.459 --> 00:04:31.469 
leveling up you're gonna use it to buy

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:34.939 
leveling up you're gonna use it to buy
the<00:04:31.530> bal-27<00:04:32.069> and<00:04:32.849> then<00:04:33.419> now<00:04:33.539> the<00:04:33.599> ak-12<00:04:34.139> r.i.p

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
the bal-27 and then now the ak-12 r.i.p

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:37.730 
the bal-27 and then now the ak-12 r.i.p
could<00:04:35.370> also<00:04:35.580> be<00:04:35.909> worth<00:04:36.120> like<00:04:36.360> 80<00:04:36.870> to<00:04:37.139> 100<00:04:37.530> coins

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
could also be worth like 80 to 100 coins

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.920 
could also be worth like 80 to 100 coins
so<00:04:37.889> you<00:04:37.979> have<00:04:38.129> to<00:04:38.219> save<00:04:38.400> up<00:04:38.550> for<00:04:38.729> that<00:04:38.909> too<00:04:39.180> now

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
so you have to save up for that too now

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.600 
so you have to save up for that too now
that's<00:04:40.110> just<00:04:40.199> my<00:04:40.409> idea<00:04:40.710> guys<00:04:40.889> that<00:04:41.069> does<00:04:41.340> seem

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
that's just my idea guys that does seem

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:42.740 
that's just my idea guys that does seem
like<00:04:41.729> it<00:04:41.849> could<00:04:42.060> be<00:04:42.090> something<00:04:42.389> that<00:04:42.599> works

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
like it could be something that works

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.540 
like it could be something that works
out<00:04:43.050> it<00:04:43.259> does<00:04:43.590> seem<00:04:43.800> something<00:04:44.099> pretty<00:04:44.310> sick

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
out it does seem something pretty sick

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.700 
out it does seem something pretty sick
and<00:04:44.729> now<00:04:45.240> we've<00:04:45.389> already<00:04:45.509> seen<00:04:45.810> a<00:04:45.870> coin<00:04:46.259> system

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
and now we've already seen a coin system

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:47.929 
and now we've already seen a coin system
within<00:04:46.830> block<00:04:47.129> op<00:04:47.280> someone<00:04:47.580> where<00:04:47.699> you<00:04:47.789> could

00:04:47.929 --> 00:04:47.939 
within block op someone where you could

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:50.029 
within block op someone where you could
buy<00:04:48.090> gold<00:04:48.479> camo<00:04:48.810> for<00:04:48.990> ten<00:04:49.379> thousand<00:04:49.889> Cod

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
buy gold camo for ten thousand Cod

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:51.920 
buy gold camo for ten thousand Cod
points<00:04:50.250> and<00:04:50.969> that<00:04:51.360> was<00:04:51.449> a<00:04:51.479> very<00:04:51.689> different

spending like five games in order to get
one<00:05:34.050> gun<00:05:34.289> rather<00:05:34.919> than<00:05:35.159> getting<00:05:35.430> it<00:05:35.520> in<00:05:35.639> a

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
one gun rather than getting it in a

Supply Drop

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:38.119 
Supply Drop
but<00:05:36.690> of<00:05:36.810> course<00:05:36.839> hopefully<00:05:37.319> there<00:05:37.710> is<00:05:37.740> still<00:05:38.039> a

00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:38.129 
but of course hopefully there is still a

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:40.070 
but of course hopefully there is still a
chance<00:05:38.370> to<00:05:38.520> get<00:05:38.879> it<00:05:39.060> within<00:05:39.240> a<00:05:39.449> Supply<00:05:39.719> Drop<00:05:39.779> if

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
chance to get it within a Supply Drop if
