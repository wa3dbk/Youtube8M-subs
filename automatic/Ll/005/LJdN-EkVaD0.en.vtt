00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
player and it's kind of a bummer that we

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.170 
player and it's kind of a bummer that we
always<00:00:25.170> have<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.439> wait<00:00:25.650> so<00:00:26.250> long<00:00:26.279> just<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.000> get

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
always have to wait so long just to get

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.670 
always have to wait so long just to get
the<00:00:27.269> map<00:00:27.390> packs<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.930> don't<00:00:28.199> understand<00:00:28.560> why

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
the map packs I don't understand why

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.080 
the map packs I don't understand why
they<00:00:28.890> don't<00:00:28.980> just<00:00:29.130> release<00:00:29.609> them<00:00:29.760> at<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:29.939> same

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
they don't just release them at the same

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.080 
they don't just release them at the same
day<00:00:30.330> but<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.080> think<00:00:31.650> Microsoft<00:00:32.579> actually<00:00:32.880> pays

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
day but I think Microsoft actually pays

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.740 
day but I think Microsoft actually pays
extra<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.660> get<00:00:33.750> them<00:00:33.899> early<00:00:33.960> but<00:00:34.950> yeah<00:00:35.790> so<00:00:36.090> I'm

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
extra to get them early but yeah so I'm

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.060 
extra to get them early but yeah so I'm
going<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:36.960> just<00:00:37.260> give<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.440> guys<00:00:37.649> some<00:00:37.860> quick
