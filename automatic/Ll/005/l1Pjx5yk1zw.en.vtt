00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 today we will prepare the boys together 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.240
 ideal pistachio custard from 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.189
 serve as a spoon dessert as well 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.500
 also to be used for stuffing cream puffs i 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.240
 cannoncini or even cakes la 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.490
 preparation as usual is easy 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.190
 easy easy and the result always 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.480
 then guaranteed sugar milk 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.859
 pistachios in hand and we see doses 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.010
 Friday institutions to prepare a delicious 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.340
 they create temporary bags for one 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.560
 cream 500 milliliters of milk 70 grams 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.630
 of pistachio paste or in the 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:36.180
 same amount of unsalted pistachios 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:39.000
 3 egg yolks 90 grams of sugar 50 g of 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.920
 maizena the main ingredient of 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.719
 this cream naturally represented 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.640
 from pistachio paste 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.100
 if you don't have it and can do nothing you can 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.200
 buy the unsalted pistachios though and 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.610
 chop them very very finally maybe 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.649
 you can help by adding a 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.210
 teaspoon of oil to form one 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.460
 cream in this case but will serve a 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.680
 blender and very powerful ok I have it 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.899
 purchased online but you can also 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.280
 requires a pharmacy 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.229
 the base clearly the classical one 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.180
 of custard or or 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.860
 shell the eggs split the yolks from the 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.260
 egg albums and we won't need them for 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.700
 but we can use this recipe 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.490
 to prepare maybe meringues 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.259
 or amaretti, the yolks or gathered 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.170
 inside a bowl together with 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.390
 sugar and now we'll get better makes a 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.920
 we will go to cream them with whips 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:28.890
 electricity to about 400 milliliters of 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.710
 milk inside a saucepan ne 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.930
 I keep a little about 100 milliliters because 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.310
 then we will go to join the milk to the a 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.500
 egg cream and the milk warms up slowly 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.530
 slowly we count the egg mixture and 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.530
 sugar 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.050
 after a few minutes you see how it is 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.370
 cream has become pretty frothy and white 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.100
 once this is achieved 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.930
 foamy mixture we can combine the starch 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.420
 any other corn is fine too 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.650
 type of starch is fine 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.410
 rice to get a lot of cream 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.600
 velvety and add 100 milliliters 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.369
 in short, about cold milk 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.140
 we have kept it that way 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:16.750
 we will avoid to do the dusting me and 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:18.850
 now we still aim here this is it 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.270
 the consistency of our compound 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.270
 frothy 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.080
 there remains where it is to amalgamate the 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.080
 our pistachio paste inside 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.350
 the app that is about to boil 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:37.570
 a bit mix keep the paste 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:40.450
 pistachios which has a brownish color 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.220
 because there are no colors 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.070
 other pastas also exist on the market 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.990
 of pistachio more or less colored than 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.390
 green and that depends on the presence o 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.010
 there are less gods than colorants 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.500
 natural dyes that are usually 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.050
 more prepared with a spinach extract 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:03.880
 we mix to mix well indeed 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:07.410
 pistachio we raise the flame and then 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.410
 we combine the egg mixture 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.590
 therefore we continue to always mix a 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:19.480
 moderately low heat until 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.730
 we will see that the cream thickens you see 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.330
 that the cream has practically thickened 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.370
 immediately we can remove from the fire 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.500
 we always continue to muscle then 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.989
 let it completely cool first 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.850
 but of course let them cool the 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.650
 I advise you to cover it with a sheet 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.200
 of transparent film to direct 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.910
 contact with the custard in 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.250
 this way we will avoid training 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.380
 of the superficial crust 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.990
 when the pistachio custard 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.430
 has cooled we can remove the 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.960
 film you see that I do n't really know a 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.640
 direct contact 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:57.110
 I recommend you do it because otherwise you will 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.850
 crust form is texture is 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.440
 the classic one, in short, of the 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.240
 custard in the end we can 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.040
 pour it directly into one 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.890
 little bag or in a syringe from 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.700
 pastry chef and I'll show you the 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.870
 result then as it comes out and now there 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.640
 I show my idea of 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.160
 presentation we said that this 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.739
 cream lends itself to filling vineyards or 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.079
 cannoli but also right his life like 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.730
 spoon dessert ok so i took it 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:29.470
 a small bowl accompanied by gods 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:29.470
 pistachios and we put in an orderly way 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.810
 finish with some powder of 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.480
 pistachio and I would say a dessert 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.400
 delicious then you can save it in 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.350
 refrigerator for three up to four 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.090
 days always covered with film 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.800
 or even better inside a 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.479
 closed jar for the screw cap 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.130
 thanks for your attention put me a 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:55.060
 like it if you enjoyed hello to
