00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.910 
here's the other fender talk about a
pain<00:01:31.150> I<00:01:31.180> had<00:01:31.450> to<00:01:31.510> drill<00:01:31.840> my<00:01:32.020> own<00:01:32.050> hole<00:01:32.470> for<00:01:32.830> the

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
pain I had to drill my own hole for the

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.420 
pain I had to drill my own hole for the
antenna<00:01:33.250> you<00:01:36.570> can't<00:01:37.570> even<00:01:37.720> get<00:01:37.960> a<00:01:38.200> Fender<00:01:38.770> with

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
antenna you can't even get a Fender with

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.340 
antenna you can't even get a Fender with
an<00:01:39.550> antenna<00:01:39.820> hole<00:01:40.119> in<00:01:40.330> it<00:01:40.479> you<00:01:40.899> have<00:01:41.020> to<00:01:41.170> make

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
an antenna hole in it you have to make

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.160 
an antenna hole in it you have to make
it<00:01:41.530> yourself

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
it yourself

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.040 
it yourself
it's<00:01:44.170> kind<00:01:44.380> of<00:01:44.470> retarded<00:01:44.979> I<00:01:45.100> think<00:01:45.369> but<00:01:46.050> now

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
it's kind of retarded I think but now

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.790 
it's kind of retarded I think but now
what<00:01:47.320> can<00:01:47.500> you<00:01:47.590> do<00:01:48.539> and<00:01:49.539> go<00:01:49.930> figure<00:01:50.350> I<00:01:50.380> made<00:01:50.680> the

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
what can you do and go figure I made the

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.320 
what can you do and go figure I made the
hole<00:01:50.979> in<00:01:51.190> the<00:01:51.310> wrong<00:01:51.490> place<00:01:51.880> ain't<00:01:52.780> that<00:01:52.960> great

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
hole in the wrong place ain't that great

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.139 
hole in the wrong place ain't that great
so<00:01:55.330> now<00:01:55.710> this<00:01:56.710> little<00:01:56.920> bracket<00:01:57.310> here<00:01:57.759> has<00:01:57.970> to

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
so now this little bracket here has to

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.770 
so now this little bracket here has to
get<00:01:58.300> adjusted<00:01:58.930> see<00:01:59.740> that's<00:01:59.920> where<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:01.390> bolts

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
get adjusted see that's where it bolts

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.440 
get adjusted see that's where it bolts
on<00:02:01.960> send<00:02:02.710> two<00:02:02.950> holes<00:02:03.220> that<00:02:03.399> bolts<00:02:03.820> in<00:02:04.000> right

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
on send two holes that bolts in right

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.020 
on send two holes that bolts in right
there<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:07.149> we<00:02:07.360> had<00:02:07.510> to<00:02:08.340> take<00:02:09.340> a<00:02:09.369> little<00:02:09.610> bit<00:02:09.850> out

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
there so we had to take a little bit out

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.910 
there so we had to take a little bit out
of<00:02:10.060> it<00:02:10.330> and<00:02:10.690> I'm<00:02:10.780> just<00:02:10.840> going<00:02:11.080> to<00:02:11.170> tack<00:02:11.440> weld<00:02:11.769> it

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
of it and I'm just going to tack weld it

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.620 
of it and I'm just going to tack weld it
right<00:02:12.070> now<00:02:12.250> set<00:02:12.549> it<00:02:12.670> back<00:02:12.820> in<00:02:13.060> there<00:02:13.209> see<00:02:13.390> if<00:02:13.480> it

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
right now set it back in there see if it

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:14.280 
right now set it back in there see if it
fits

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
fits

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.650 
fits
if<00:02:14.769> it<00:02:15.010> fits<00:02:15.280> I'll<00:02:15.459> take<00:02:15.640> it<00:02:15.790> back<00:02:15.940> out<00:02:16.180> finish

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
if it fits I'll take it back out finish

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:23.000 
if it fits I'll take it back out finish
weld<00:02:16.900> it<00:02:19.260> this<00:02:20.260> sucks

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.120 

all<00:02:24.010> right<00:02:24.340> check<00:02:24.700> it<00:02:24.730> out<00:02:25.500> got<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.530> doors<00:02:26.860> and

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
all right check it out got the doors and

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.410 
all right check it out got the doors and
stuff<00:02:27.310> on<00:02:27.610> I<00:02:28.049> do<00:02:29.049> have<00:02:29.530> a<00:02:29.890> problem<00:02:30.489> though<00:02:30.760> I

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.100 

guess<00:02:34.420> it<00:02:34.570> should<00:02:34.690> have<00:02:34.810> paid<00:02:34.930> better

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
guess it should have paid better

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.580 
guess it should have paid better
attention<00:02:35.230> to<00:02:36.100> this<00:02:36.220> cab<00:02:36.549> when<00:02:36.850> I<00:02:36.880> got<00:02:37.180> it
