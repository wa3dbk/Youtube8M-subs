don't have anywhere else for it to talk
to<00:01:43.030> yet<00:01:43.330> so<00:01:43.750> this<00:01:44.080> is<00:01:44.110> just<00:01:44.470> a<00:01:44.830> future<00:01:45.280> plan<00:01:45.640> bit

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
to yet so this is just a future plan bit

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.690 
to yet so this is just a future plan bit
i'll<00:01:47.050> see<00:01:47.320> if<00:01:47.410> i<00:01:47.500> can't<00:01:47.740> get<00:01:47.890> this<00:01:48.130> into<00:01:48.400> space

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
i'll see if i can't get this into space

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.020 
i'll see if i can't get this into space
because<00:01:49.390> this<00:01:49.630> is<00:01:49.840> very<00:01:50.410> important<00:01:51.280> i'll<00:01:51.760> see

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
because this is very important i'll see

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.620 
because this is very important i'll see
you<00:01:52.150> there<00:01:52.360> and<00:01:53.850> we<00:01:54.850> are<00:01:55.060> here<00:01:55.390> at<00:01:55.509> the

you there and we are here at the
launchpad<00:01:55.929> i<00:01:56.530> do<00:01:56.740> believe<00:01:57.070> this<00:01:57.340> is<00:01:57.399> the<00:01:57.520> first

nighttime launch we've had in this

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.580 
nighttime launch we've had in this
program<00:02:00.190> so<00:02:00.910> that's<00:02:01.119> nice<00:02:01.330> you'll<00:02:02.259> note<00:02:02.410> up

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
program so that's nice you'll note up

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.260

flight engineer this is a attachment I

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.540 
flight engineer this is a attachment I
put<00:02:07.330> on<00:02:07.479> this<00:02:07.509> craft<00:02:07.899> because<00:02:08.860> this<00:02:09.280> one<00:02:09.429> will

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
put on this craft because this one will

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.820 
put on this craft because this one will
need<00:02:09.729> a<00:02:09.759> lot<00:02:10.270> more<00:02:10.300> precise<00:02:11.140> orbital

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
need a lot more precise orbital

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.250 
need a lot more precise orbital

will<00:02:22.060> only<00:02:22.240> want<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.930> vessel<00:02:23.890> and<00:02:24.130> orbit

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
will only want the vessel and orbit

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.050 
will only want the vessel and orbit
views<00:02:25.150> so<00:02:25.569> let's<00:02:25.780> close<00:02:26.410> out<00:02:26.560> those<00:02:26.710> others

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
views so let's close out those others

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.610 
views so let's close out those others
this<00:02:28.060> tells<00:02:28.360> us<00:02:28.480> how<00:02:28.660> much<00:02:28.750> delta<00:02:29.110> v<00:02:29.230> we've<00:02:29.410> got

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
this tells us how much delta v we've got

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.830 
this tells us how much delta v we've got
left<00:02:29.860> what<00:02:30.640> our<00:02:30.760> orbital<00:02:31.150> parameters<00:02:31.330> are<00:02:31.720> at

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
left what our orbital parameters are at

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.660 
left what our orbital parameters are at
the<00:02:31.930> moment<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.440> all<00:02:32.800> sorts<00:02:33.130> of<00:02:33.190> other<00:02:33.310> fun

the moment and all sorts of other fun

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.100 
the moment and all sorts of other fun
stuff<00:02:34.319> very<00:02:35.319> useful<00:02:35.730> so<00:02:36.730> without<00:02:37.300> further<00:02:37.420> ado

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
stuff very useful so without further ado

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.309 
stuff very useful so without further ado
let's<00:02:39.000> check<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.180> staging<00:02:40.660> over<00:02:40.870> real<00:02:41.020> quick

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
let's check the staging over real quick

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.580 
let's check the staging over real quick
and<00:02:41.860> yeah<00:02:42.760> that<00:02:43.090> looks<00:02:43.569> about<00:02:43.780> right<00:02:44.080> and

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.740 

where<00:02:47.590> is<00:02:47.830> everything<00:02:48.190> right<00:02:48.370> now<00:02:48.400> oh<00:02:48.760> right<00:02:49.540> I

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
where is everything right now oh right I

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.540 
where is everything right now oh right I
don't<00:02:50.110> have<00:02:50.290> anything<00:02:50.620> orbit<00:02:51.930> silly<00:02:52.930> me<00:02:53.080> up

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
don't have anything orbit silly me up

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.729 
don't have anything orbit silly me up
launch

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.520 

I'm<00:02:57.739> really<00:02:58.670> starting<00:02:59.239> to<00:02:59.450> get<00:02:59.659> over<00:02:59.989> the<00:03:00.200> big

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
I'm really starting to get over the big

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.640 
I'm really starting to get over the big
huge<00:03:00.890> rocket<00:03:01.189> thing<00:03:01.579> by<00:03:02.450> this<00:03:02.629> point<00:03:02.870> you'll

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
huge rocket thing by this point you'll

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.130 
huge rocket thing by this point you'll
note<00:03:03.829> this<00:03:04.099> one<00:03:04.280> only<00:03:04.430> has<00:03:04.629> three<00:03:05.629> fuel<00:03:05.870> tanks

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
note this one only has three fuel tanks

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.470 
note this one only has three fuel tanks
in<00:03:06.230> each<00:03:06.349> stage<00:03:06.680> I<00:03:07.099> actually<00:03:07.819> did<00:03:08.209> some

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
in each stage I actually did some

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.479 
in each stage I actually did some
looking<00:03:08.720> into<00:03:09.049> it<00:03:09.170> and<00:03:09.349> this<00:03:10.040> is<00:03:10.220> more

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
looking into it and this is more

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.599 
looking into it and this is more
efficient<00:03:11.030> than<00:03:11.230> having<00:03:12.230> larger<00:03:12.859> rockets<00:03:13.280> you

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
efficient than having larger rockets you

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:16.119 
efficient than having larger rockets you
can<00:03:13.790> get<00:03:14.450> more<00:03:14.689> Delta<00:03:15.439> V<00:03:15.590> out<00:03:15.739> of<00:03:15.890> it<00:03:15.980> because

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
can get more Delta V out of it because

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.809 
can get more Delta V out of it because
you're<00:03:16.400> hauling<00:03:16.579> less<00:03:16.879> fuel<00:03:17.319> I'm<00:03:18.459> guess<00:03:19.459> that

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
you're hauling less fuel I'm guess that

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.520 
you're hauling less fuel I'm guess that
makes<00:03:20.269> sense<00:03:20.420> but<00:03:20.959> I<00:03:21.019> would<00:03:21.260> have<00:03:21.379> never

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
makes sense but I would have never

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.410 
makes sense but I would have never
thought<00:03:21.680> of<00:03:21.950> making<00:03:22.189> smaller<00:03:22.609> rockets<00:03:23.120> to<00:03:23.269> get

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
thought of making smaller rockets to get

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:32.470 
thought of making smaller rockets to get
further<00:03:24.519> and<00:03:27.069> staging<00:03:29.019> and<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:32.090> gravity

further and staging and the gravity

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.319 
further and staging and the gravity
turning

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329

our<00:03:41.840> last<00:03:42.139> stage<00:03:43.209> might<00:03:44.209> want<00:03:44.420> to<00:03:44.510> invest<00:03:44.810> in

oh<00:04:27.530> yeah<00:04:28.160> there<00:04:28.400> we<00:04:28.520> go<00:04:28.550> and<00:04:30.880> hold<00:04:31.880> that<00:04:32.570> there

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
oh yeah there we go and hold that there

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:41.939 
oh yeah there we go and hold that there
thrust<00:04:38.050> oops<00:04:39.050> that's<00:04:39.470> that<00:04:39.740> stage<00:04:40.099> and

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
thrust oops that's that stage and

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:46.089 
thrust oops that's that stage and
separate<00:04:43.000> and<00:04:44.000> separate<00:04:44.509> and<00:04:44.889> since<00:04:45.889> this<00:04:46.039> is

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:46.099 
separate and separate and since this is

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:49.330 
separate and separate and since this is
a<00:04:46.250> station<00:04:46.699> it<00:04:47.120> won't<00:04:47.570> need<00:04:47.930> really<00:04:48.740> any<00:04:48.949> fuel

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
a station it won't need really any fuel

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.279 
a station it won't need really any fuel
I<00:04:49.370> just<00:04:49.669> packed<00:04:49.970> a<00:04:50.210> bit<00:04:50.360> despair<00:04:50.750> in<00:04:50.990> case<00:04:51.169> I

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:51.289 
I just packed a bit despair in case I

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:52.600 
I just packed a bit despair in case I
wanted<00:04:51.530> to<00:04:51.620> make<00:04:51.710> some<00:04:51.889> adjustments<00:04:52.340> to<00:04:52.490> my

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
wanted to make some adjustments to my

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.390 
wanted to make some adjustments to my
network<00:04:52.789> later<00:04:53.180> this<00:04:54.169> will<00:04:54.710> stay<00:04:55.070> in<00:04:55.250> orbit

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
network later this will stay in orbit

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.879 
network later this will stay in orbit
this<00:04:55.639> is<00:04:55.789> not<00:04:56.030> a<00:04:56.240> return<00:04:56.539> vehicle<00:04:56.870> I<00:04:57.259> might

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
this is not a return vehicle I might

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:00.189 
this is not a return vehicle I might
have<00:04:58.550> to<00:04:58.820> do<00:04:59.240> some<00:04:59.270> sort<00:04:59.570> of<00:04:59.659> crew<00:04:59.930> rotation

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 
have to do some sort of crew rotation

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:04.930 
have to do some sort of crew rotation
with<00:05:00.830> Looney<00:05:01.220> here<00:05:01.490> but<00:05:03.220> I'm<00:05:04.220> not<00:05:04.490> planning<00:05:04.669> on

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
with Looney here but I'm not planning on

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:11.170 
with Looney here but I'm not planning on
it<00:05:05.259> you<00:05:06.259> can<00:05:06.440> just<00:05:06.680> deal<00:05:07.280> with<00:05:07.490> it<00:05:07.520> oh<00:05:09.250> shoot<00:05:10.250> my

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
it you can just deal with it oh shoot my

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.550 
it you can just deal with it oh shoot my
orbit<00:05:11.449> is<00:05:11.570> like<00:05:11.690> really<00:05:12.199> skewed<00:05:12.710> now<00:05:14.560> actually

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
orbit is like really skewed now actually

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.620 
orbit is like really skewed now actually
this<00:05:15.590> is<00:05:15.919> a<00:05:15.949> good<00:05:16.639> thing<00:05:16.669> because<00:05:17.060> the<00:05:17.389> higher

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
this is a good thing because the higher

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.339 
this is a good thing because the higher
this<00:05:17.930> is<00:05:18.199> the<00:05:18.770> happier<00:05:19.159> I<00:05:19.250> am<00:05:19.430> I'll<00:05:20.389> raise<00:05:20.990> this

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349 
this is the happier I am I'll raise this

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:27.749 
this is the happier I am I'll raise this
Apple<00:05:21.889> apsis<00:05:22.280> up<00:05:22.490> to<00:05:23.590> 350<00:05:24.590> kilometers<00:05:25.099> and

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:32.230 

round<00:05:28.759> my<00:05:28.969> orbit<00:05:29.330> around<00:05:29.479> that<00:05:29.990> instead<00:05:30.530> Oh<00:05:31.240> No

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
round my orbit around that instead Oh No

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:40.610 
round my orbit around that instead Oh No
get<00:05:32.719> on<00:05:32.870> okay<00:05:33.800> there<00:05:34.789> we<00:05:35.000> go

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:46.730 

cut<00:05:43.440> eccentricity<00:05:44.440> of<00:05:44.470> point<00:05:45.070> zero<00:05:45.220> zero<00:05:45.640> two

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
cut eccentricity of point zero zero two

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:52.970 
cut eccentricity of point zero zero two
that's<00:05:47.740> pretty<00:05:48.190> good<00:05:48.550> I<00:05:48.580> think<00:05:49.650> so<00:05:50.650> now<00:05:50.950> let's

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:52.980 
that's pretty good I think so now let's

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:58.530 
that's pretty good I think so now let's
open<00:05:53.980> up<00:05:54.220> these<00:05:56.580> yes<00:05:57.580> I<00:05:57.850> know<00:05:57.880> their<00:05:58.210> ladders

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:58.540 
open up these yes I know their ladders

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.360 
open up these yes I know their ladders
but<00:05:58.720> let's<00:05:58.960> just<00:05:59.200> pretend<00:05:59.410> there's<00:06:00.070> some<00:06:00.250> sort

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
but let's just pretend there's some sort

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:07.050 
but let's just pretend there's some sort
of<00:06:00.490> signal<00:06:00.790> amplification<00:06:01.600> majigger<00:06:06.060> they

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
of signal amplification majigger they

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:27.150 
of signal amplification majigger they
just<00:06:07.240> look<00:06:07.390> really<00:06:07.420> cool

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.160 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:38.159 

okay<00:06:28.160> we<00:06:29.030> believe<00:06:29.480> we<00:06:29.750> are<00:06:29.780> situated<00:06:30.290> here

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:38.169 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:40.229 

you
