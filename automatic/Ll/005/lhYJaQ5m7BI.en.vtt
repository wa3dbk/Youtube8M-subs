00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
angle with the shield coming down and

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.189 
angle with the shield coming down and
then<00:00:49.980> John<00:00:50.370> Cena<00:00:50.730> Ryback<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.570> Sheamus<00:00:51.629> came

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
then John Cena Ryback and Sheamus came

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.470

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.139 
out and they had that brawl and the
shield<00:00:54.750> retreated<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:56.070> naturally<00:00:56.850> seems

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
shield retreated so that naturally seems

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.910 
shield retreated so that naturally seems
to<00:00:57.390> be<00:00:57.510> leading<00:00:57.719> towards<00:00:58.320> Elimination

instead go with rock vs punk again so

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.179 
instead go with rock vs punk again so
that<00:01:17.850> does<00:01:18.150> leave<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.750> with<00:01:19.070> the<00:01:20.070> opportunity

make this happen so I think that um you

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.830 
make this happen so I think that um you
know<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:38.040> only<00:02:38.220> makes<00:02:38.520> sense<00:02:38.700> for<00:02:39.240> for<00:02:39.540> Triple

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840

know it only makes sense for for Triple
H<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:40.170> be<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.410> one<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.800> induct<00:02:41.130> Bruno<00:02:41.490> when

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.700 
H to be the one to induct Bruno when
he's<00:02:41.760> such<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.000> big<00:02:42.360> fan<00:02:42.630> of<00:02:42.660> Bruno's<00:02:43.170> legacy

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
he's such a big fan of Bruno's legacy

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.460

and<00:02:44.360> nobody<00:02:45.360> can<00:02:45.510> tell<00:02:45.720> that<00:02:45.930> story<00:02:46.110> I<00:02:46.380> think

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
and nobody can tell that story I think

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.710 
and nobody can tell that story I think
better<00:02:46.890> than<00:02:47.100> Triple<00:02:47.400> H<00:02:47.550> so<00:02:47.850> I<00:02:48.060> think<00:02:48.330> that

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
better than Triple H so I think that

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.060 
better than Triple H so I think that
Triple<00:02:49.230> H<00:02:49.290> is<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.470> obvious<00:02:49.710> pick<00:02:50.100> here<00:02:52.070> next

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
Triple H is the obvious pick here next

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
little bit ridiculous and then they

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.170 
little bit ridiculous and then they
started<00:04:39.980> inducting<00:04:40.980> like<00:04:41.130> Pete<00:04:41.400> Rose<00:04:41.670> and<00:04:42.090> a

2006 I think were the best years and
this<00:04:48.120> year<00:04:48.180> should<00:04:48.510> be<00:04:48.570> really<00:04:48.900> good<00:04:49.020> as<00:04:49.140> well
