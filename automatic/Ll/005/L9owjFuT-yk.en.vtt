00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.900
 hello girls how are you today I come with a 

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:08.750
 new video with a mini trick and good at 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.629
 these dates so pointed I wanted 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.150
 tell you that we often think of 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:16.070
 how to highlight lips eyes like having a 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.140
 perfect makeup and in many 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.750
 Sometimes I think that the most 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.429
 important is to prepare the skin and have 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.960
 a pretty skin even with a little 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:26.599
 makeup if we have beautiful skin 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.830
 will highlight everything much more and 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.449
 we will be delighted with the 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.039
 result so it seems very 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.840
 important to prepare the skin one of my 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.879
 favorite beauty rituals that I think 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.739
 that help a lot to prepare the skin 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.510
 and that is much prettier is the 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.899
 exfoliation thanks to it we eliminate 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.000
 Dead cells remove blackheads 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.309
 ugly things that we have and I think the 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.539
 skin regenerates and is much more looks 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:48.980
 much prettier 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:50.870
 one of my favorite exfoliants that 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.219
 I'm using a lot lately 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:57.320
 is this ocean salt of the and lima is 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.870
 perfect because it has sea salt which 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.550
 helps me a lot for me because I have the 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.850
 oily skin 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.380
 and good is this creampie smells great 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.170
 just with the skin a little 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.140
 wet I plundered pearly and a massage 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.110
 in a circular way and after a while I 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.520
 rinse with water and I withdraw it and 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.380
 it is quite easy and it is already not 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.360
 has no secret also makes a few 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.280
 months ago I made a video about how to have a 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.750
 perfect skin that I recommend you 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.280
 see if you have not done it yet and 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.770
 end of this video will also give a 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.869
 recipe on an exfoliating mask 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.570
 homemade with honey and sugar that you can see 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.550
 in the video if you feel like it and finally 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.750
 I would like to remind you that if you have a 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.119
 important appointment 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.240
 do not exfoliate jce the skin the day before 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.580
 because it might leave you red or 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.860
 that you mark your face a bit then 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.020
 it will always be better to do it in a 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.179
 constant once a week or every two 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.190
 weeks and the day before an appointment 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.140
 important with an event that you want 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.200
 go well pretty do not try products 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.210
 new and we pillaged JCE with him 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.890
 very strong way because it could cause 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.229
 evils greater than what you want 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.479
 solve so it's better to keep a 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.440
 routine and as I say this this is 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.110
 liking 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.180
 aus in salt and here's the trick today 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.130
 to be impeccable at these parties 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.020

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.340
