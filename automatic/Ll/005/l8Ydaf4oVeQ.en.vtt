00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:05.599
 greetings to everyone in this presentation and are the nucleic acid 

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:08.529
 nucleotides 

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:12.919
 nucleic acids in general are large molecules consisting of 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:14.109
 nucleotides 

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:18.259
 their name derives from the fact that they possess astrid character were initially 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:21.269
 found in the nuclei of the cells 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.189
 but are also present in other locations 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.189
 as quoted by the mitochondria and plastic glue 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:31.529
 figure to the right shows a model of a dna molecule 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.590
 main function is to act as a medium in which the information 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.410
 is stored in premieres 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.410
 to be reviewed later elsewhere 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.690
 beyond this function 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.330
 some RNA molecules also exhibit catalytic activity and act 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.660
 as enzymes 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.660
 called deposits 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.880
 just as proteins are polymers of humble amino acids by bonds 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.220
 peptidic 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.020
 nucleic acids are also punished 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.240
 but of nucleotides and onyxes by him and his wife. 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.840
 on the other hand the favelas see the post posta de mestre 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.430
 and we can see the nucleotides 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.600
 in the case of cv and more specifically the inep highlighted by a circus 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.580
 the two types of nucleic acids found in cells are to divert the 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.850
 deoxyribonucleic acid 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.190
 the sister 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.920
 or ribonucleic acid 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.920
 about which we will see later 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.190
 each nucleus tite 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.190
 is a molecule made up of three other

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.260
 a base cloth ship can be an apurinã azoriana sata delineia boninho 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.410
 or a pepper

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.730
 a cough penalty 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.270
 the rain figures 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.499
 what is homicide 

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:03.990
 which may be the answer to the agreement, I think that if they reported 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.250
 and last of yellow groups outside 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.350
 a phosphoric acid residue on the stage 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:17.010
 besides having the function to constitute the chassis of the blades some nucleotides 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.149
 can perform other functions 

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:20.489
 how to have skin 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.319
 of phosphate that only so that it acts in processes involve transfer of 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.259
 energy 

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:33.009
 let us now see the differences between the molecules of dna pedi rna 

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:34.929
 starting with mma 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:37.909
 rna is ribonucleic acid 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:42.019
 tightening of the nucleotides that constitute the exterior and can 

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.959
 quotation marks 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.079
 nucleotides that make up the RNA molecule can not 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:48.709
 to be 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.150
 now if she paid the mirna she quoted the scene and the avenue 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.849
 which are generally indicated by the initials 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:57.969
 The Official 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:02:59.180
 and structure 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.730
 usually consists of a simple chain and we can see eliana fig 

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:12.179
 dna is deoxyribonucleic acid 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:17.359
 to petals we will wake up the nucleotides that constitutes the current pm 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:20.009
 even the person I can 

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:27.599
 Aspassia enter the nucleotide schedules of the reaction team in the 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.199
 the Chinese whose initials are fish would be good 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:34.939
 I notice that the team is not only found in dna 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:38.199
 to pastor to racism is found only in the rna 

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:43.150
 and the structure of the dna molecule generally consists of two chains 

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:45.469
 joined by hydrogen bonds 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:46.899
 the padlock 

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:51.619
 and the hydrogen bonds between the peace and transfer but we can 

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:54.619
 see there in the figure below 

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:05.339
 hydrogen bonds and brings peace and quotes only linking the two chains 

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:08.279
 nucleotides of the dna molecule 

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:10.139
 for him to us parents 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:12.509
 as follows: 

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:13.849
 the notary 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.109
 competitiveness 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.350
 but later in another place we will see that there is a girl too 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:21.499
 would participate with rasi 

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:24.859
 between the avenue and the thymine forming two hydrogen bonds 

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:30.099
 the thrashing looks like the situation 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:34.039
 and so far no one cited china form three drainage connections 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:36.259
 How can we see the figure next to us? 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:39.870
 7 hydrogen bonds are home the short schools 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:46.400
 hence it follows that the number of goiânia but the equality sector siemens 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.919
 and the aden number - the same number of times 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:54.309
 it's prose
