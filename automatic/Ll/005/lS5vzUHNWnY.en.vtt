00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
original tweet the plan has changed a

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.100 
original tweet the plan has changed a
little<00:03:38.130> I'm<00:03:38.549> not<00:03:38.820> confirming<00:03:39.209> anything<00:03:39.660> but

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
little I'm not confirming anything but

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.949 
little I'm not confirming anything but
my<00:03:40.290> prediction<00:03:40.950> is<00:03:41.160> that<00:03:41.400> in<00:03:41.940> title<00:03:42.480> update<00:03:42.750> 9

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
my prediction is that in title update 9

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.319 
my prediction is that in title update 9
there<00:03:43.380> will<00:03:43.500> be<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:44.100> end<00:03:44.340> with<00:03:44.790> all<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.150> end

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
there will be the end with all the end

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.120 
there will be the end with all the end
stuff<00:03:45.630> like<00:03:45.900> ender<00:03:46.260> dragons<00:03:46.680> and<00:03:46.890> ender

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
stuff like ender dragons and ender

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.280 
stuff like ender dragons and ender
portal<00:03:47.489> obviously<00:03:48.060> I<00:03:48.209> mean<00:03:48.450> working<00:03:48.750> end<00:03:49.170> of

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
portal obviously I mean working end of

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.160 
portal obviously I mean working end of
horses<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:49.829> seamless<00:03:50.549> but<00:03:51.030> plan<00:03:51.299> has<00:03:51.600> changed

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
horses and seamless but plan has changed

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.340 
horses and seamless but plan has changed
a<00:03:52.260> little<00:03:52.380> I<00:03:52.860> think<00:03:53.850> that<00:03:54.060> means<00:03:54.360> that<00:03:54.930> some

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
a little I think that means that some

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.410 
a little I think that means that some
other<00:03:55.709> stuff<00:03:56.040> will<00:03:56.340> be<00:03:56.459> added<00:03:56.790> but<00:03:56.940> not<00:03:57.180> much

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
other stuff will be added but not much

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.920 
other stuff will be added but not much
else

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
else

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.650 
else
so<00:03:58.320> maybe<00:03:58.530> spawn<00:03:59.519> eggs<00:03:59.910> they'll<00:04:00.209> throw<00:04:00.480> that

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
so maybe spawn eggs they'll throw that

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.039 
so maybe spawn eggs they'll throw that
in<00:04:00.780> there<00:04:01.019> and<00:04:01.290> maybe<00:04:01.790> just<00:04:02.790> maybe<00:04:03.090> if<00:04:03.870> we're

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
in there and maybe just maybe if we're

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.710 
in there and maybe just maybe if we're
lucky<00:04:04.170> they're<00:04:05.160> gonna<00:04:05.310> add<00:04:05.579> jungle<00:04:06.239> biomes

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720
