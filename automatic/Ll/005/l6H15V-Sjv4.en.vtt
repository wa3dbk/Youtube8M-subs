00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
enough of that I love it they did so

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.420 
enough of that I love it they did so
beautifully<00:00:28.760> the<00:00:29.760> one<00:00:30.800> complaint<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:32.040> gets<00:00:32.279> not

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
beautifully the one complaint I gets not

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.610 
beautifully the one complaint I gets not
really<00:00:32.610> complained<00:00:33.120> but<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:34.020> fell<00:00:34.380> more

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
really complained but it fell more

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.500 
really complained but it fell more
suspenseful<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.640> manga<00:00:35.880> but<00:00:36.210> that's<00:00:36.360> only

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
suspenseful in the manga but that's only

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.119 
suspenseful in the manga but that's only
because<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:37.110> anime<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.559> going<00:00:37.800> at<00:00:37.890> such<00:00:38.070> a

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
because the anime is going at such a

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.020 
because the anime is going at such a
fast<00:00:38.879> pace<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.719> feels<00:00:40.440> like<00:00:40.590> it's<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.460> know<00:00:41.489> it

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
fast pace it feels like it's you know it

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.119 
fast pace it feels like it's you know it
didn't<00:00:42.600> have<00:00:42.750> as<00:00:42.870> much<00:00:42.899> build-up<00:00:43.649> as<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.010> did

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
didn't have as much build-up as it did

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.950 
didn't have as much build-up as it did
in<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.309> manga<00:00:44.520> but<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.300> was<00:00:45.420> still<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:45.870> was

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
in the manga but it was still it was

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.340 
in the manga but it was still it was
still<00:00:46.200> amazing<00:00:46.350> like<00:00:47.160> well<00:00:48.000> done<00:00:48.510> Matt<00:00:49.079> house

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
then they could release the bombs right

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.430 
then they could release the bombs right
because<00:03:33.030> they're<00:03:33.180> all<00:03:33.270> gonna<00:03:33.420> die<00:03:33.630> anyway<00:03:34.050> but

then again we talk he talks about the

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.280 
then again we talk he talks about the
mental<00:03:36.270> state<00:03:36.510> they<00:03:36.630> were<00:03:36.690> all<00:03:36.810> in<00:03:36.990> how<00:03:37.260> you

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290
