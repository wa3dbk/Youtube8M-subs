pro to a certain extent have some design
quarks<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.740> are<00:00:28.890> unique<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.510> microsoft<00:00:30.510> in

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
quarks that are unique to microsoft in

quarks that are unique to microsoft in
the<00:00:30.720> tablet<00:00:31.109> space<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:32.340> know<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:32.640> is

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
the tablet space so you know this is

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.720 
the tablet space so you know this is
it's<00:00:33.630> an<00:00:33.809> almost<00:00:34.230> 11<00:00:34.649> inch<00:00:34.829> wide<00:00:35.040> tablet<00:00:35.579> which

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
it's an almost 11 inch wide tablet which

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.270 
it's an almost 11 inch wide tablet which
to<00:00:35.969> me<00:00:36.149> still<00:00:36.660> feels<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.380> little<00:00:37.590> bit<00:00:37.800> weird<00:00:37.980> why

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
to me still feels a little bit weird why

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.220 
to me still feels a little bit weird why
did<00:00:38.460> they<00:00:38.550> do<00:00:38.610> that<00:00:38.760> they<00:00:39.510> did<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:39.989> because

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
did they do that they did that because

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.440 
did they do that they did that because
it's<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.860> perfect<00:00:41.160> size<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.850> give<00:00:42.000> people<00:00:42.360> a

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
it's the perfect size to give people a

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.479 
it's the perfect size to give people a
full-size<00:00:42.989> keyboard<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.040> the

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
full-size keyboard and that is the

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.610 
full-size keyboard and that is the
clearest<00:00:44.820> way<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.390> understand<00:00:45.989> their<00:00:46.170> overall

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
clearest way to understand their overall

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.740 
clearest way to understand their overall
intentions<00:00:47.280> these<00:00:47.940> are<00:00:48.329> not<00:00:48.360> your

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
intentions these are not your

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.709 
intentions these are not your
traditional<00:00:49.230> tablets<00:00:50.070> their<00:00:50.309> their<00:00:51.030> hybrid

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
traditional tablets their their hybrid

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.779 
traditional tablets their their hybrid
devices<00:00:52.140> they're<00:00:52.559> about<00:00:52.710> productivity<00:00:53.399> and

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
devices they're about productivity and

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.750 
devices they're about productivity and
some<00:00:54.210> fun<00:00:54.420> on<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.690> side<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.309> Pro<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.640> you

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
some fun on the side that Pro and you

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.430 
some fun on the side that Pro and you
can<00:00:56.910> tell<00:00:57.090> me<00:00:57.210> cuz<00:00:57.449> you're<00:00:57.600> you're<00:00:57.960> testing

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
can tell me cuz you're you're testing

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.900 
can tell me cuz you're you're testing
that<00:00:58.559> thing<00:00:58.800> looks<00:00:59.070> like<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.250> monster<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.699> would

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
that thing looks like a monster I would

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.880 
that thing looks like a monster I would
never<00:01:00.120> consider<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.899> tablet<00:01:01.379> it's<00:01:01.530> big

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
never consider that a tablet it's big

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.039 
never consider that a tablet it's big
and<00:01:02.250> but<00:01:02.460> like<00:01:02.609> when<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.820> said<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.270> my<00:01:03.300> review<00:01:03.750> of

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
and but like when I said in my review of

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.520 
and but like when I said in my review of
the<00:01:04.290> original<00:01:05.540> surface<00:01:06.540> pro<00:01:06.990> there's<00:01:07.470> a

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
the original surface pro there's a

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.410 
the original surface pro there's a
difference<00:01:08.010> between<00:01:08.070> mobility<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.150> mobile

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
difference between mobility and mobile

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.270 
difference between mobility and mobile
computing<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.140> mean<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.860> computing

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
computing I mean this the computing

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.820 
computing I mean this the computing
power<00:01:11.310> in<00:01:11.670> this<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:12.150> just<00:01:12.600> its<00:01:12.960> massive<00:01:13.200> look<00:01:13.710> I

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
power in this is just its massive look I

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.490 
power in this is just its massive look I
can<00:01:14.040> run<00:01:14.330> the<00:01:15.330> full<00:01:15.540> version<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.960> Photoshop

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
can run the full version of Photoshop

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.840 
can run the full version of Photoshop
right<00:01:16.799> there<00:01:17.009> it's<00:01:17.280> photoshop<00:01:17.700> creative

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
right there it's photoshop creative

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.160 
right there it's photoshop creative
cloud<00:01:18.590> and<00:01:19.970> what<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.000> see<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.540> great<00:01:21.750> use<00:01:21.960> case

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
cloud and what I see the great use case

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.499 
cloud and what I see the great use case
of<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.759> probably<00:01:23.970> why<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.270> does

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
of this is that and probably why it does

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.609 
of this is that and probably why it does
so<00:01:24.659> well<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.930> can<00:01:25.049> plug<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.350> into<00:01:25.530> a

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
so well you can plug this into a

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.340 
so well you can plug this into a
workstation<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.970> can<00:01:27.090> drive<00:01:27.330> your<00:01:27.540> second

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
workstation and it can drive your second

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.380 
workstation and it can drive your second
monitor<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.189> all<00:01:29.369> your<00:01:29.549> USB<00:01:30.000> connected

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390

monitor and of all your USB connected
gear<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.079> then<00:01:31.200> throw<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.439> in<00:01:31.530> your<00:01:31.560> bag<00:01:31.740> at

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
gear and then throw it in your bag at

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.080 
gear and then throw it in your bag at
the<00:01:31.950> end<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.159> day<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.369> got<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.610> say<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:32.790> like
