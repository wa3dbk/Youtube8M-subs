00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:12.390
 the car is not with me 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.769
 change pads remove to 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:19.930
 put the jacking machine 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.930
 removed the wheel now need to unscrew the steering wheel 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.730
 that the house was not to get to the caliper 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.980
 pull out the bed 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.570
 when we removed the wheel we returned it to you 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.140
 we see super how to remove it is necessary 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:41.710
 fix 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:44.650
 and at 15 here is this nut angle we 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:48.580
 super wear caliper head nut 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.470
 by 13 and so that you don't need a mother 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:56.590
 I have a big enough lever 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:59.050
 is erased, we remove the pad from super 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.059
 I do not creak normal and therefore not 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.440
 need to do something with them I will say 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.440
 for one as ordered pads 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.950
 bolt we unscrewed right here from below and 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.960
 we understand super changed finds well 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:20.100
 on the usual piston and cylinder this one 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.140
 brake he clamped heal pads 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.660
 to open the cathedral you just need 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.780
 squeeze either a screwdriver here 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:31.650
 from long support he is a widow cylinder 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.600
 you can raise super or just 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.790
 shake he likes give vii 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.460
 open without problems me new pads 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.180
 so the problems somehow did not make 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:47.190
 at the same time we check the status of anthers 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:51.149
 here and there are no cracks if there is 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:55.710
 we change when we put a new block 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:58.979
 Be sure to unscrew the brake tank 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.630
 liquids so when we put in 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.420
 push the cylinder did not leak brake 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.860
 fluid it is necessary to watch this they 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.670
 will swing it there either 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.459
 but look what has not flowed out all the gulf 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.880
 was then this is not something be careful 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:19.590
 when you put a new pads remove 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.989
 further pads is metal 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.680
 here such plates we them simply 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:27.269
 pulling out the greens yourself 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.750
 shipped exactly the same in mine 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:34.410
 new anti- scratch pads 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.739
 how on scotch which husband fasten anyway 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:41.730
 Here I will understand how they are without me 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:46.910
 and we paste back in order not to 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.910
 creaked we remove these pads 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.190
 clean up any dirt in them 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.380
 sky 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:03:02.099
 My configuration here lining TR 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:05.610
 trw there were already bolts and such 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:09.690
 no need to buy plates, but if we donâ€™t 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:12.920
 clean standing back they are removed here 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.920
 they like that 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.760
 at the same time we look 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.760
 anther 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.830
 brake cylinder hoses everything was 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.830
 it is seen 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.960
 next we put the pads i lubricate everything 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.460
 places where there is 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.530
 rides pads poverty mask I do not know 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.410
 right wrong 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.300
 on previous machines helped to not 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.060
 It was 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.930
 squeaky creaks at me here this caliper 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.030
 brakes 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.719
 I did not do much did not address all 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.719
 checked 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.720
 loves and someone knows 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.950
 manually 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.530
 checked yet not found 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.530
 i 'm afraid 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:35.160
 and when you need to push the cylinder 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:39.360
 can this make clamps possible efforts 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:42.090
 attach i did like this thing on 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.530
 very comfortable to smog necessarily 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:48.840
 look at the level of brake fluid 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:51.060
 that she did not pour out further we set 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.110
 back bolt but he must necessarily 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.720
 to be with thread lock 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.690
 red stripe in order to 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.590
 he got out of vibration 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.900
 high temperature antisex set off 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.630
 would just be plastered and inserted 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.930
 back and spin the ball you haven't 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.930
 will fall out 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.950
 turn the wheel screwed bolt 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:20.460
 put the caliper in place 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:23.130
 nothing if I have a disk then we shoot 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.610
 just this bolt, he removed the whole 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.860
 caliper 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.160
 the problem occurs when the disk is changed from 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.590
 With this bolt it boils or you need a lever 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.560
 large to either impact screwdriver and 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.030
 bang but i paid very much then 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.660
 what not to unscrew it just general 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:43.680
 boils very much problems at the back 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:49.560
 so well, who was the video useful to me 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:52.970
 I will be very glad to all the screw water Respect 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.970
 good luck to all
