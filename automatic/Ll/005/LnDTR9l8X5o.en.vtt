00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 followed then let's take a look at the 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.230
 modal loan chords reminding you that 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.320
 you have to always take into account the 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.889
 melody is a cut can work well 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.920
 theoretically may be interesting but it is 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.880
 suddenly with the melody you may not 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.080
 that's good 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.269
 Okay you have to use common sense and the 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.590
 I also like the chords of 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.410
 global loan 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:34.559
 agrees modal loan of basic form 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:39.960
 may originate in cold Greek modes 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:43.620
 7 or its minor parallel 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.440
 For smaller scales, for example, we are 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.719
 taking a look here in the championship only the 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.960
 but we could have 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.230
 modal loan of smallest sun is not 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.770
 unique under the name is logical or even 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.500
 minor chords of other degrees of 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.300
 other scales is the neighboring tones is a 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.019
 thing we have to take a closer look at 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.299
 forward 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:11.939
 Okay, so I'm going to make a progression and 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.650
 monica here and I'll use some chords 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.970
 modal loan that is for us 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.229
 to realize better we have our version there 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.020
 from the song, right? 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.090
 Congratulations to you from the previous video. 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.920
 let's take a look now how's that 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.159
 would get some loan chords 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.159
 Congratulations to you. 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:48.570
 on this dear date 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:50.490
 many good wishes the frog life here 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.040
 we have some situations and chords 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.590
 modal loan making a shop then 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.370
 we have our court is 17 higher 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.690
 we only have here our fifth grade 17 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:05.130
 lower normal 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:09.510
 then I do 12 here in me then me 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:17.120
 there are here this sequence of accord 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:26.100
 modal loan because despite the sun 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:30.660
 higher indicating here a lower harmonic 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.970
 and I used the natural minor chord without the 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.640
 seventh to indicate that this 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.040
 record can be a chord belonging to the 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.820
 harmonic minor scale or smaller 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.880
 melodic 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:50.910
 Then we have here one big and one 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:54.150
 and also does not belong to the 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.640
 which may be of the pain scale 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.530
 greater or dominate a lot we have two 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:09.300
 situations here of loan chords 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:11.310
 modal and 25 dominants that prepare for 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.390
 a modal loan chord as per 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.390
 example, if 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.360
 the 13th mall are called dominant 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.840
 auxiliaries 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.240
 ok we have the secondary dominants who 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.790
 let's see next and the documents 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.430
 auxiliaries are the dominant ones that 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.950
 prepare for a loan chord of the 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.970
 with a rope that does not belong to that 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.970
 scale 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:42.840
 ok they lent otherwise minor 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.840
 or the Greek way whatever the rock
