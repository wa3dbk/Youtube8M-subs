we're going to make an analysis of this

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.320 
we're going to make an analysis of this
so<00:00:28.680> we're<00:00:28.890> gonna<00:00:29.039> break<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.849> screen<00:00:30.060> shows

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
so we're gonna break the screen shows

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.999 
so we're gonna break the screen shows
down<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:30.990> know<00:00:31.109> find<00:00:31.410> loads<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.800> new

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.890 

we<00:02:29.920> go<00:02:30.070> about<00:02:30.220> our<00:02:30.280> daily<00:02:30.580> lives

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
we go about our daily lives

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.670 
we go about our daily lives
understanding<00:02:31.900> almost<00:02:32.170> nothing<00:02:32.380> in<00:02:32.620> the

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
understanding almost nothing in the

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.100 
understanding almost nothing in the
world<00:02:33.030> we<00:02:34.030> give<00:02:34.210> little<00:02:34.390> thought<00:02:34.630> to<00:02:34.840> the

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
world we give little thought to the

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.020 
world we give little thought to the
machinery<00:02:35.620> that<00:02:35.740> generates<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.580> sunlight

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
machinery that generates the sunlight

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.070 
machinery that generates the sunlight
that<00:02:37.240> makes<00:02:37.420> life<00:02:37.600> possible<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.630> gravity

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
that makes life possible to the gravity

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.170 
that makes life possible to the gravity
that<00:02:41.200> glues<00:02:41.800> us<00:02:42.040> to<00:02:42.220> an<00:02:42.310> earth<00:02:42.580> but<00:02:43.000> otherwise

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
send us spinning off into space alter

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.390 
send us spinning off into space alter
the<00:02:46.210> atoms<00:02:46.570> of<00:02:46.810> which<00:02:47.020> they<00:02:47.200> are<00:02:47.230> made<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:47.800> on
