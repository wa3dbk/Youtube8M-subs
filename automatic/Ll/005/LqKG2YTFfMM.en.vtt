00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
this mod and that might be because I

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.620 
this mod and that might be because I
haven't<00:00:17.490> really<00:00:17.730> played<00:00:17.910> interception

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
haven't really played interception

missions that much now I like to be

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.010 
missions that much now I like to be
optimistic<00:00:20.760> about<00:00:21.029> things<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.600> like<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.900> be

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
happy and upbeat but I'm just going to

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.790 
happy and upbeat but I'm just going to
straight-up<00:00:24.119> say<00:00:24.420> it<00:00:24.600> people<00:00:25.050> who<00:00:25.350> play<00:00:25.590> these

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
straight-up say it people who play these

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.980 
straight-up say it people who play these
interception<00:00:26.490> missions<00:00:26.519> are<00:00:27.000> almost<00:00:27.660> always

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
interception missions are almost always

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.859 
interception missions are almost always
absolutely<00:00:28.699> horrible<00:00:29.699> at<00:00:29.880> them<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.300> tried

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
absolutely horrible at them I tried

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.569 
absolutely horrible at them I tried
playing<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.320> couple<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:32.160> kept<00:00:32.430> getting

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
playing a couple and I kept getting

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.950 
playing a couple and I kept getting
paired<00:00:32.969> with<00:00:33.090> people<00:00:33.450> who<00:00:33.540> were<00:00:33.660> kind<00:00:33.840> of

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
paired with people who were kind of

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.819 
paired with people who were kind of
newer<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.440> game<00:00:34.559> which<00:00:34.710> is

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
newer to the game which is

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.350 
newer to the game which is
understandable<00:00:35.460> because<00:00:35.760> earth<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.120> one<00:00:36.270> of

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
understandable because earth is one of

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.880 
understandable because earth is one of
the<00:00:36.420> first<00:00:36.540> 3<00:00:36.840> planets<00:00:37.230> but<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.440> only<00:00:37.559> problem

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
the first 3 planets but the only problem

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.100 
the first 3 planets but the only problem
is<00:00:38.280> since<00:00:38.820> this<00:00:38.969> mod<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.329> only<00:00:39.510> available<00:00:40.050> from

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
is since this mod is only available from

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.979 
is since this mod is only available from
a<00:00:40.260> select<00:00:40.620> few<00:00:40.710> places<00:00:41.340> or<00:00:41.730> interception<00:00:42.719> is

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
a select few places or interception is

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.660 
a select few places or interception is
one<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.410> few<00:00:43.559> methods<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:44.129> get<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.489> mod

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
one of the few methods to get this mod

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.069 
one of the few methods to get this mod
so<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:44.969> try<00:00:45.180> playing<00:00:45.450> interception<00:00:46.050> missions

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
so you try playing interception missions

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.810 
so you try playing interception missions
and<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.920> end<00:00:47.070> up<00:00:47.160> getting<00:00:47.280> paired<00:00:47.610> up<00:00:47.730> with

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
and you end up getting paired up with

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.190 
and you end up getting paired up with
low<00:00:48.000> levels<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.480> can't<00:00:48.750> handle<00:00:49.110> these

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
low levels that can't handle these

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.600 
low levels that can't handle these
missions<00:00:49.559> because<00:00:49.829> these<00:00:49.950> missions<00:00:50.309> are<00:00:50.399> much

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
missions because these missions are much

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.920 
missions because these missions are much
more<00:00:50.820> difficult<00:00:50.969> than<00:00:51.329> they<00:00:51.420> need<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.600> be<00:00:51.719> for

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
more difficult than they need to be for

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.080 
more difficult than they need to be for
lower<00:00:52.079> levels<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:52.680> it's<00:00:53.309> enough<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.670> my<00:00:53.789> rant

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
lower levels so it's enough of my rant

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.490 
lower levels so it's enough of my rant
if<00:00:54.539> you're<00:00:54.690> going<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.870> do<00:00:54.960> interception

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
if you're going to do interception

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.810 
if you're going to do interception
missions<00:00:55.530> make<00:00:56.010> sure<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.430> bring<00:00:56.760> some

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
missions make sure you bring some

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.939 
missions make sure you bring some
friends<00:00:57.360> make<00:00:57.960> sure<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.170> get<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.320> party<00:00:58.739> if<00:00:58.859> you

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
friends make sure you get a party if you

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.860 
friends make sure you get a party if you
play<00:00:59.100> by<00:00:59.250> yourself<00:00:59.370> they're<00:01:00.149> possible<00:01:00.690> but

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
play by yourself they're possible but

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.990 
play by yourself they're possible but
you're<00:01:00.989> going<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.170> need<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.590> decent<00:01:02.399> warframe

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
you're going to need a decent warframe

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.090 
you're going to need a decent warframe
like<00:01:03.210> Vauban<00:01:03.719> they<00:01:03.899> can<00:01:04.049> lay<00:01:04.199> down<00:01:04.409> traps<00:01:04.799> to

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
like Vauban they can lay down traps to

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.280 
like Vauban they can lay down traps to
protect<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:06.030> areas<00:01:06.450> because<00:01:06.720> if<00:01:06.869> not<00:01:07.110> you're

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
protect the areas because if not you're

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.450 
protect the areas because if not you're
going<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.439> be<00:01:07.500> running<00:01:07.740> back<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.159> forth<00:01:08.369> like

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
going to be running back and forth like

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.429 
going to be running back and forth like
I<00:01:08.729> was<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.299> mission<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.810> just<00:01:10.229> running

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
I was in this mission I just running

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.960 
I was in this mission I just running
back<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.770> forth<00:01:10.830> protecting<00:01:11.610> them<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.880> by

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
back and forth protecting them and by

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.429 
back and forth protecting them and by
the<00:01:12.030> time<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.420> capture<00:01:12.810> all<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:12.990> them<00:01:13.200> again

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
the time you capture all of them again

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.410 
the time you capture all of them again
another<00:01:14.159> one's<00:01:14.430> just<00:01:14.640> going<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.850> get<00:01:15.000> captured

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
another one's just going to get captured

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.840 
another one's just going to get captured
anyway<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.560> next<00:01:16.860> method<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.280> can<00:01:17.460> do<00:01:17.640> is

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
anyway so the next method you can do is

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.270 
anyway so the next method you can do is
by<00:01:18.570> fighting<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.200> goose<00:01:19.380> track<00:01:19.619> 3<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:19.979> they

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
by fighting the goose track 3 and they

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.950 
by fighting the goose track 3 and they
actually<00:01:20.640> have<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> really<00:01:21.360> good<00:01:21.630> chance<00:01:21.869> to
