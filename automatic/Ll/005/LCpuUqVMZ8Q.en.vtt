00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 Hello everyone, today I am going to talk to you about 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.660
 hair products and about my routine 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.280
 hair and is that some of you 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.019
 you have asked in comments on 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.059
 other videos what do I do so 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.650
 nothing here I will explain everything to you 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.020
 First of all, tell them that my hair is 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.480
 very thick very abundant and quite dry 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.720
 you need to nourish it enough so 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.449
 good for you to know a little bit about what in 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.699
 what guided my products I am not 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.580
 a very manic person with the 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.650
 silicones I have used products and without 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.420
 very good silicones like for example the 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.460
 Phyto range that is a range that I love 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.930
 that you can find in pharmacies without 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.090
 But now I'm trying another type 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.770
 of products that contain perhaps a 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.160
 little silicone but it's not a 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.289
 very striking thing and nothing we go there the 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.129
 shampoo that I use is this one that this 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.899
 it's called bynum and thermal and like my hair 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.629
 it's so thick it holds a lot of time 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.760
 clean so I can throw my head off 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.199
 between two and three times a week 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.449
 this is the shampoo that I use that is 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.910
 for very dry and very damaged hair and 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.989
 I'm really doing phenomenally 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.909
 I usually have to use some 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.310
 other product 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.310
 But if I ever caught with 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.140
 hurry then it could be enough in 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.630
 regarding moisturizing products that I use 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.090
 with the shower I use the shower we go and 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.720
 therefore they are with clarified I have 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.750
 these 2 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.820
 which are the mask penetrate 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.160
 Sebastian is a mask for 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.480
 very dry hair the range to me is 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.580
 liking a lot 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.560
 If you have fine hair I do not know how 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.960
 Will it be but the fact is that to me is me 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.960
 enchanting leaves the hair very nourished and 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.380
 very strong and with a feeling of well 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.360
 of softness that I loved another 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.910
 product that I am using is this 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.310
 the range is factor of tiji and it is called 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.470
 Shyris conditioner is a conditioner 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.229
 that smells great because it smells like 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.290
 jelly beans like this has a sweetish aroma and 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.000
 Leaves hair very nourished what more 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.680
 it strikes me is the consistency 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.110
 since normally the conditioners 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.360
 for the hair are light however 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.790
 This is very dense and quite a texture 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.530
 very rich and therefore when adding it in 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.750
 the hair in the shower is not going to 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.690
 drain but stays that endures 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.730
 a time pegadito to the hair I find in 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.800
 Regarding products without rinsing also 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.560
 I have two in the first place this 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.140
 alternating that is from the bamboo range and it 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.000
 flame andy oil is an oil for 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.670
 Hair intended for hair 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.680
 There is a lighter version for hair 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.390
 fine but good I'm using 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.880
 I use it when I get out of the shower 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.400
 with wet hair helps protect 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.440
 also the heat hair and about 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.290
 everything is very soft and very hair 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.750
 nourished and another product without rinsing that 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.880
 I'm using is this also from the 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.540
 range is factor of tiji that is called 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.310
 smoothie luxury share and it's a 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.740
 hair conditioner that adds 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.680
 very bright because it also has a 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.330
 little has iridescent particles and to me 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.730
 I really like to use it when I already 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.800
 dried the hair a small amount 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.930
 Well, good to leave hair very 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.520
 nurtured and loose the truth that is 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.410
 phenomenal 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.030
 and these are all the products that 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.250
 I apply and that I use on my hair 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.440
 I also use quite the tan health and 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.300
 I use it to untangle hair though 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.180
 the truth my hair does not get too tangled 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.500
 but good I have it and yes I like it 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.490
 especially when I have wet hair 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.120
 I like to use it and then also 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:30.390
 used this dryer that is of the brand 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.740
 jaguar like cars and it's a dryer 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.350
 Professional for me is very important 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.450
 use a professional hair as 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.700
 the dryers that we can find in 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.680
 large surfaces for my hair not 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.350
 they are enough and overheat a lot and 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.990
 I usually do not last anything with this 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.370
 I think that about 5 years and the 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.670
 it's really working phenomenally 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:54.750
 it's like the first day and it's very powerful 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:57.300
 It also has two speeds and three 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.790
 temperatures so good if you are 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.340
 thinking about buying a dryer and you have 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.870
 a good amount of but I recommend you 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.730
 that you go to one of these sites 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.740
 hairdressing products and that you 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.420
 recommend a good dryer that although 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.790
 be a little more expensive then it's going to 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.860
 hold much more time 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.320
 and to dry marcelo he used this 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.660
 thermal brush that is a brush 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.250
 I think it's ceramic that the truth 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.220
 that I am delighted with him because he 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:26.580
 Warms and boosts the effects of 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.620
 dryer I also have some ghd in this 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.039
 found since it was a limited edition 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:35.009
 but good at the end the iron itself the 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:36.930
 apparatus itself is the same and I use them 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:39.300
 both to straighten the hair as for 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.310
 get some waves is one of the 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.550
 best purchases I've made in my life 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:47.550
 I believe in products for the 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.669
 hair since it's like the first day and 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.470
 he's already a few years old and I 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.500
 I recommend a lot if you have any 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.870
 doubt about the ghd to me is a product 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.310
 that I love and the truth that I do not 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.780
 I regret nothing having invested the 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.850
 big money that I invested in them 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.220
 As for the color of the hair I do not know if 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:09.820
 you can see but good took some 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:12.880
 little tables in a caramel tone and dye 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.520
 of base that I have is pulling to brown 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.830
 chocolate the truth that I do not know the 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.470
 numbers of the tones but good so that 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.120
 can you get an idea and here 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.460
 everything that I can tell you about me 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.760
 Leave it in comments if you want
