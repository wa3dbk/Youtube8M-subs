as<00:00:30.300> well<00:00:31.699> taking<00:00:32.699> a<00:00:32.730> look<00:00:32.819> obviously<00:00:33.210> here<00:00:33.390> at

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
as well taking a look obviously here at

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.910 
as well taking a look obviously here at
the<00:00:33.600> front<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.069> pretty<00:00:35.280> cool<00:00:35.839> material

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
the front this is a pretty cool material

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.709 
the front this is a pretty cool material
I'm<00:00:37.920> not<00:00:38.069> sure<00:00:38.280> how<00:00:38.399> exactly<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.999> describe<00:00:39.510> it

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
I'm not sure how exactly to describe it

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.410 
I'm not sure how exactly to describe it
it<00:00:40.440> feels<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.739> little<00:00:40.829> bit<00:00:41.039> like<00:00:41.159> suede<00:00:41.579> doesn't

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
it feels a little bit like suede doesn't

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.809 
it feels a little bit like suede doesn't
exactly<00:00:42.780> feel<00:00:43.289> that<00:00:43.589> soft<00:00:43.979> but<00:00:44.309> it's<00:00:44.729> the

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:44.819 
exactly feel that soft but it's the

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:45.979 
exactly feel that soft but it's the
closest<00:00:45.179> thing<00:00:45.179> that<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.449> can<00:00:45.600> relate<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:45.960> to

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
closest thing that I can relate it to

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.500 
closest thing that I can relate it to
same<00:00:46.710> for<00:00:46.889> the<00:00:46.979> inside<00:00:47.370> here<00:00:47.699> as<00:00:47.819> well<00:00:47.999> it's

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
same for the inside here as well it's

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.639 
same for the inside here as well it's
very<00:00:48.629> very<00:00:48.929> soft<00:00:49.199> and<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.469> definitely

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
very very soft and it definitely

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.750 
very very soft and it definitely
protects<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.579> device<00:00:51.359> when<00:00:52.079> it's<00:00:52.260> closed

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
protects the device when it's closed

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.009 
protects the device when it's closed
from<00:00:53.760> what<00:00:53.940> I've<00:00:54.059> seen<00:00:54.089> personally<00:00:54.719> I've

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
from what I've seen personally I've

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:56.479 
from what I've seen personally I've
dropped<00:00:55.170> my<00:00:55.350> device<00:00:55.589> a<00:00:55.620> couple<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.010> times<00:00:56.190> and

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
dropped my device a couple of times and

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.119 
dropped my device a couple of times and
thankfully<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:56.969> haven't<00:00:57.389> really<00:00:57.620> made<00:00:58.620> any<00:00:58.679> big

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
thankfully I haven't really made any big

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.000 
thankfully I haven't really made any big
scratches<00:00:59.579> or<00:00:59.850> dents<00:01:00.089> so<00:01:00.989> I'm<00:01:01.379> pretty<00:01:01.889> happy

scratches or dents so I'm pretty happy
with<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.549> overall<00:01:02.969> protection<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:04.019> this

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
with the overall protection that this

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.090 
with the overall protection that this

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
want to leave it on you're going to have

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:07.279 
want to leave it on you're going to have
to<00:02:04.439> flip<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.979> back<00:02:05.249> like<00:02:05.549> this<00:02:06.289> obviously

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
to flip it back like this obviously

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.040 
to flip it back like this obviously
that's<00:02:07.469> just<00:02:07.740> because<00:02:07.940> this<00:02:08.940> flips<00:02:09.240> so<00:02:09.600> you're

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
that's just because this flips so you're

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.180 
that's just because this flips so you're
not<00:02:10.140> going<00:02:10.290> to<00:02:10.380> have<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.530> space<00:02:10.920> there's

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
not going to have that space there's

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.350 
not going to have that space there's
nothing<00:02:11.520> that<00:02:11.760> can<00:02:11.790> be<00:02:11.940> done<00:02:11.970> about<00:02:12.210> that

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
nothing that can be done about that

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.270 
nothing that can be done about that
that's<00:02:12.990> just<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.170> way<00:02:13.350> these

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
that's just the way these

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.449 
that's just the way these
flip<00:02:14.850> covers<00:02:15.150> are<00:02:15.330> I<00:02:15.980> obviously<00:02:16.980> never<00:02:17.190> have

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
flip covers are I obviously never have

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.490 
flip covers are I obviously never have
used<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:18.030> flip<00:02:18.390> cover<00:02:18.630> on<00:02:18.810> any<00:02:18.959> blackberry

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
used a flip cover on any blackberry

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.030 
used a flip cover on any blackberry
before<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:20.240> it's<00:02:21.240> a<00:02:21.330> little<00:02:21.510> bit<00:02:21.600> different<00:02:22.140> to

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
before so it's a little bit different to

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.100 
before so it's a little bit different to
have<00:02:23.280> this<00:02:23.940> extra<00:02:24.480> flap<00:02:26.360> being<00:02:27.360> being<00:02:27.780> used

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
have this extra flap being being used

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.540 
have this extra flap being being used
and<00:02:28.319> kind<00:02:28.709> of<00:02:28.740> getting<00:02:28.920> in<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.160> way<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.310> little

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
and kind of getting in the way a little

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.760 
and kind of getting in the way a little
bit<00:02:29.670> we'll<00:02:29.910> talk<00:02:30.090> more<00:02:30.270> about<00:02:30.330> that

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
bit we'll talk more about that

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.290 
bit we'll talk more about that
afterwards<00:02:31.850> one<00:02:32.850> of<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.000> things<00:02:33.150> that<00:02:33.209> I

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
afterwards one of the things that I

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.690 
afterwards one of the things that I
really<00:02:33.600> like<00:02:33.870> about<00:02:33.900> this<00:02:34.380> flip<00:02:35.250> shell<00:02:35.489> case

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
really like about this flip shell case

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.540 
really like about this flip shell case
is<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.030> fact<00:02:36.239> that<00:02:36.360> it<00:02:36.690> has<00:02:36.989> this<00:02:37.430> turning<00:02:38.430> on

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
is the fact that it has this turning on

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.660 
is the fact that it has this turning on
turning<00:02:39.300> off<00:02:39.510> feature<00:02:39.870> when<00:02:40.319> you<00:02:40.580> put<00:02:41.580> the

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
turning off feature when you put the

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.640 
turning off feature when you put the
cover<00:02:41.910> on<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.390> when<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:42.870> take<00:02:43.050> it<00:02:43.170> off<00:02:43.260> the

cover on and when you take it off the

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.410 
cover on and when you take it off the
the<00:02:43.950> phone<00:02:44.130> turns<00:02:44.400> on<00:02:44.580> kind<00:02:44.819> of<00:02:44.880> like<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.239> same

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
the phone turns on kind of like the same

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.580 
the phone turns on kind of like the same
idea<00:02:46.050> with<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.470> magnetic<00:02:46.800> holster<00:02:47.720> with<00:02:48.720> with

blackberries for the longest time it's
the<00:02:52.050> same<00:02:52.230> idea<00:02:52.500> here<00:02:52.560> so<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.459> actually

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
the same idea here so that actually

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.390 
the same idea here so that actually
works<00:02:53.970> really<00:02:54.060> really<00:02:54.360> well<00:02:54.600> and<00:02:55.010> I'm<00:02:56.010> really

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
works really really well and I'm really

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.040 
works really really well and I'm really
really<00:02:56.640> happy<00:02:56.790> if<00:02:56.970> there's<00:02:57.120> no<00:02:57.269> need<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.480> to

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
really happy if there's no need to to

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.870 
really happy if there's no need to to
use<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.290> power<00:02:58.470> button<00:02:58.739> or<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.310> use<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.670> swipe

up<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.360> wake<00:03:00.989> up<00:03:01.200> so<00:03:01.800> that<00:03:02.610> definitely<00:03:03.090> I<00:03:03.330> think

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
up to wake up so that definitely I think

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.870 
up to wake up so that definitely I think
helps<00:03:03.900> with<00:03:04.140> with<00:03:04.739> battery<00:03:05.130> life<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.519> to<00:03:05.670> just

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
helps with with battery life and to just

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.030 
helps with with battery life and to just
be<00:03:06.000> able<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.269> just<00:03:06.900> when<00:03:07.290> you're<00:03:07.410> done<00:03:07.560> just

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
way even it puts it in a little bit more

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.759 
way even it puts it in a little bit more
of<00:03:45.120> an<00:03:45.239> incline<00:03:46.549> stand<00:03:48.230> put<00:03:49.230> it<00:03:49.350> so<00:03:49.470> you<00:03:49.590> can

of an incline stand put it so you can
see<00:03:50.010> so<00:03:50.579> that's<00:03:51.510> actually<00:03:51.720> really<00:03:52.200> really

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.680 
see so that's actually really really
cool<00:03:52.680> I<00:03:52.920> really<00:03:53.700> dig<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.090> fact<00:03:54.299> that<00:03:54.359> it<00:03:54.510> does

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
cool I really dig the fact that it does

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.520 
cool I really dig the fact that it does
that<00:03:54.900> so<00:03:55.200> that's<00:03:56.100> definitely<00:03:56.640> a<00:03:57.120> plus<00:03:57.530> for

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
that so that's definitely a plus for

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.650

part<00:04:40.810> over<00:04:41.229> and<00:04:42.070> have<00:04:42.250> it<00:04:42.370> this<00:04:42.840> little<00:04:43.840> bit<00:04:43.990> of

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
part over and have it this little bit of

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.659

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
which again makes it a little bit

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
it and I've been able to type just as

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.909 
it and I've been able to type just as
fast<00:04:57.850> after<00:04:58.090> using<00:04:58.419> it<00:04:58.630> for<00:04:58.960> for<00:04:59.530> a<00:04:59.590> couple<00:04:59.860> of

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
fast after using it for for a couple of

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.850 
fast after using it for for a couple of
weeks<00:04:59.979> as<00:05:00.280> well<00:05:00.720> those<00:05:01.720> are<00:05:01.870> just<00:05:01.960> a<00:05:02.260> couple<00:05:02.500> of

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
weeks as well those are just a couple of

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.710 
weeks as well those are just a couple of
the<00:05:02.949> cons<00:05:03.160> that<00:05:03.250> I<00:05:03.400> think<00:05:03.639> I<00:05:03.850> personally<00:05:04.660> just

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
the cons that I think I personally just

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.480 
the cons that I think I personally just
don't<00:05:05.199> love<00:05:06.389> typing<00:05:07.389> on<00:05:07.510> this<00:05:07.660> as<00:05:07.870> much<00:05:08.490> I

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
don't love typing on this as much I

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.560 
don't love typing on this as much I
think<00:05:10.240> it's<00:05:10.360> pretty<00:05:10.510> much<00:05:10.720> it<00:05:10.900> this<00:05:11.350> this<00:05:12.190> case

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
think it's pretty much it this this case

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.050 
think it's pretty much it this this case
does<00:05:13.570> exactly<00:05:13.870> what<00:05:14.050> it's<00:05:14.260> supposed<00:05:14.320> to<00:05:14.680> do

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
does exactly what it's supposed to do

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.969 
does exactly what it's supposed to do
it's<00:05:16.060> a<00:05:16.180> flip<00:05:16.360> case<00:05:16.570> and<00:05:16.810> protect<00:05:17.770> your<00:05:17.889> device

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
it's a flip case and protect your device

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.390 
it's a flip case and protect your device
that<00:05:18.850> allows<00:05:19.060> it<00:05:19.270> to<00:05:19.300> wake<00:05:19.539> up<00:05:19.750> when<00:05:20.050> you<00:05:20.400> when

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
that allows it to wake up when you when

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.420 
that allows it to wake up when you when
you<00:05:21.430> open<00:05:21.789> it<00:05:21.880> and<00:05:22.229> it<00:05:23.229> turns<00:05:23.889> into<00:05:24.010> a<00:05:24.190> pretty
