00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.699
 Hello friends how are you 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.770
 Well let's go to the place where I work and I'll show you each 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.600
 element of the bodybuilding program without nonsense 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.050
 let's do it 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.420
 today we are going to give our muscles a reason to grow was not 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.420
 kidding when I said without distractions 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.830
 let's do rowing 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.030
 it's one of my favorite exercises I do not know why because I like the 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.840
 exercises now let's go into what is called upside down training that is 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.490
 one of the components that make my program unique 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.370
 and forced everyone to do it 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.520
 whether I trained for a year four years 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.520
 during the 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.680
 let's talk about how to set goals and what goals you should 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.480
 propose you personally based on the type of body you have now 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.830
 you cold focus on developing muscle you could focus on burning fat 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.860
 It depends 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.930
 the first thing you have to clarify 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.930
 and what I cut you 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.840
 There is a great debate about whether throwing yourself is good or bad, the truth is that 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.810
 you have to do it after about ten minutes of warm-up in the 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.410
 treadmill or after warm-up conditioning that I will teach you 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.540
 later I like it is to pull shorter muscles work slower and 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.630
 weakly many people say that if garcía before the impact 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:51.960
 He has friends 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.550
 we have finished the training phase upside down and the circuit 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.830
 fitness you have learned how to be 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.700
 we have done shoulder stability exercises 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.700
 it's time to talk about the first six months of the program 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.700
 fish the training phase for beginners and 

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:15.669
 wench make tricep extensions with dumbbells 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:19.879
 these are also known as square skulls and buy noses 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:22.999
 sandra noses 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:24.979
 I like dumbbells 

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:27.979
 you are probably going to have an imbalance in your arms 3 

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:37.549
 let's start with the lower abdomen 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.989
 to teach you a progression of three levels to work the abdomen 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:45.400
 level 1 would consist of doing straight leg lifts on a 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.399
 flat banking 

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:50.509
 this is level 1 that could be considered the easiest 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.269
 you just have to be these leg lifts 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.269
 let your hips take off from the bench 

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:02.599
 good friends 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.909
 I am in the growth phase I am trying to do the exercises 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.179
 that they teach my book to the letter 

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:12.179
 tried to reach 230 pounds and then I'm going to cut back 

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:16.709
 remember that if they want to be marked they have to overcome the weight desired by 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.729
 25 or 30 pounds 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:21.159
 so I want to get to 230 pounds 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:25.159
 and when I reported I will have abdominals marked at the moment 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:28.159
 you can see my abs and 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:36.389

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:04.379

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.209

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.069
 tell them 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.539
 we're going to be talking about bodybuilding nutrition 

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:17.989
 and what better place for that than my own kitchen 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.409

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:23.839

 I would like to say goodbye with the saying 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.990
 a phrase that my father shared with me 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.499
 He always told me 

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:50.429
 successful people have developed the habit of doing what people without 

00:04:50.429 --> 00:04:54.089
 success does not want to remind you that everything I have taught you comes 

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:56.539
 of a guy who has never used steroids 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:58.309
 this is natural bodybuilding
