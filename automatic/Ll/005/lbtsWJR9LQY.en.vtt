I<00:01:46.470> can't<00:01:46.860> really<00:01:47.070> guess<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.759> cuz<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.680> don't

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.200 
I can't really guess that cuz I don't
know<00:01:49.860> maybe<00:01:50.070> Dolph<00:01:50.399> Ziggler<00:01:50.759> or<00:01:50.970> maybe

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
know maybe Dolph Ziggler or maybe

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.569 
know maybe Dolph Ziggler or maybe
another<00:01:51.630> returning<00:01:52.170> superstar<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.890> legend<00:01:53.399> or

somebody like that but I do believe that

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.010 
somebody like that but I do believe that
the<00:01:55.680> last<00:01:55.890> three<00:01:56.369> at<00:01:56.700> least<00:01:57.000> will<00:01:57.240> probably<00:01:57.840> be

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
the last three at least will probably be

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.020 
the last three at least will probably be
Dan<00:01:58.439> O'Brien<00:01:58.710> Roman<00:01:59.280> reigns<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.729> Randy<00:01:59.850> Orton

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
Rumble is probably the most surprising

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.190 
Rumble is probably the most surprising
pay-per-view<00:02:20.610> of<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.820> whole<00:02:21.030> year<00:02:21.480> or<00:02:21.660> one<00:02:22.050> of

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
the most surprising paper use of the

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.100 
the most surprising paper use of the
whole<00:02:23.640> year<00:02:23.940> if<00:02:24.060> everybody's<00:02:24.810> expecting

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
whole year if everybody's expecting

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.020 
whole year if everybody's expecting
Roman<00:02:25.500> reigns<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.860> win<00:02:26.070> and<00:02:26.340> he<00:02:26.460> actually<00:02:26.610> does

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
Roman reigns to win and he actually does

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.670 
Roman reigns to win and he actually does
then<00:02:27.300> it<00:02:27.390> kind<00:02:27.600> of<00:02:27.660> kills<00:02:28.020> you<00:02:28.350> know<00:02:28.470> the

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
then it kind of kills you know the

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.460 
then it kind of kills you know the
surprise<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.790> wow<00:02:29.970> factor<00:02:30.630> that<00:02:30.660> we<00:02:31.290> usually

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
surprise the wow factor that we usually

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.110 
surprise the wow factor that we usually
have<00:02:31.860> in<00:02:32.040> paper<00:02:32.250> views<00:02:32.490> like<00:02:32.670> this<00:02:32.850> so

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
have in paper views like this so

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.840 
have in paper views like this so
therefore<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.750> believe<00:02:34.290> that<00:02:34.590> other<00:02:35.340> people

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
therefore I believe that other people

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.480 
therefore I believe that other people
are<00:02:36.060> deserving<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.870> win<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:38.190> Royal<00:02:38.340> Rumble

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
are deserving to win the Royal Rumble

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.890 
are deserving to win the Royal Rumble
and<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.090> do<00:02:39.150> believe<00:02:39.360> that<00:02:39.630> Roman<00:02:39.870> reigns

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
and I do believe that Roman reigns

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.080 
and I do believe that Roman reigns
doesn't<00:02:40.350> need<00:02:40.740> to<00:02:41.370> win<00:02:41.520> the<00:02:41.700> Royal<00:02:41.820> Rumble

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
doesn't need to win the Royal Rumble

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.510 
doesn't need to win the Royal Rumble
this<00:02:42.450> year<00:02:42.810> in<00:02:42.990> order<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.680> take<00:02:43.950> place<00:02:44.190> in<00:02:44.430> a

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
this year in order to take place in a

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.340 
this year in order to take place in a
big<00:02:44.700> part<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.090> Wrestlemania<00:02:45.750> he<00:02:45.900> doesn't<00:02:46.230> need

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
big part of Wrestlemania he doesn't need

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.870 
big part of Wrestlemania he doesn't need
it<00:02:46.410> because<00:02:46.890> he's<00:02:47.100> already<00:02:47.250> big<00:02:47.670> he's

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
it because he's already big he's

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.060 
it because he's already big he's
probably<00:02:48.060> one<00:02:48.300> of<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.480> biggest<00:02:49.070> superstars

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
probably one of the biggest superstars

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.430 
probably one of the biggest superstars
in<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.400> business<00:02:51.060> right<00:02:51.390> now<00:02:51.450> so<00:02:51.930> if<00:02:52.140> he<00:02:52.260> wins

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.440 
he's basically stealing the spotlight
from<00:03:28.620> other<00:03:29.010> superstars<00:03:29.700> cuz<00:03:29.940> he<00:03:30.060> had<00:03:30.240> his

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
from other superstars cuz he had his

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.610 
from other superstars cuz he had his
moment<00:03:30.900> and<00:03:30.990> you'll<00:03:31.200> have<00:03:31.380> other

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.380 
moment and you'll have other
opportunities<00:03:31.880> throughout<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:33.030> year<00:03:33.210> but

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
opportunities throughout the year but

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.870 
opportunities throughout the year but
the<00:03:33.540> Royal<00:03:33.750> Rumble<00:03:33.990> man<00:03:34.830> I<00:03:35.250> don't<00:03:35.430> think<00:03:35.670> he

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
the Royal Rumble man I don't think he

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.610 
the Royal Rumble man I don't think he
will<00:03:36.090> win<00:03:36.150> I<00:03:36.360> don't<00:03:36.660> think<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:37.020> chances<00:03:37.500> are

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
will win I don't think the chances are

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.170 
will win I don't think the chances are
of<00:03:37.740> him<00:03:37.890> winning<00:03:38.130> are<00:03:38.490> really<00:03:38.820> that<00:03:39.000> height

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
of him winning are really that height

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.090 
of him winning are really that height
now<00:03:39.360> he<00:03:39.420> has<00:03:39.570> a<00:03:39.600> good<00:03:39.810> story<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.560> why<00:03:40.710> he<00:03:40.890> should

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
now he has a good story to why he should

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.580 
now he has a good story to why he should
win<00:03:41.310> but<00:03:42.000> will<00:03:42.180> WWE<00:03:42.810> actually<00:03:43.200> make<00:03:43.410> that

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
win but will WWE actually make that

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.220 
win but will WWE actually make that
decision<00:03:43.890> now<00:03:44.310> I<00:03:44.340> do<00:03:44.610> not<00:03:44.970> think<00:03:45.240> so<00:03:45.510> okay<00:03:45.900> and

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
decision now I do not think so okay and

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.980 
decision now I do not think so okay and
I<00:03:46.770> think<00:03:46.980> that<00:03:47.130> is<00:03:47.310> definitely<00:03:47.640> best<00:03:48.300> four

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
I think that is definitely best four

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.140 
I think that is definitely best four
minutes<00:03:49.530> letting<00:03:50.100> somebody<00:03:50.340> else<00:03:50.550> kill<00:03:51.030> the
