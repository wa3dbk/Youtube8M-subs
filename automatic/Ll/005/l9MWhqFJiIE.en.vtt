00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.000 

I<00:03:11.330> think<00:03:12.020> I'm<00:03:12.110> gonna<00:03:12.230> hit<00:03:12.380> it<00:03:12.440> right<00:03:12.710> in<00:03:12.770> the

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
I think I'm gonna hit it right in the

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.390 
I think I'm gonna hit it right in the
middle<00:03:13.300> then<00:03:14.300> you<00:03:15.290> know<00:03:15.410> they<00:03:15.680> can<00:03:15.830> all<00:03:16.010> just

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
middle then you know they can all just

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.660 
middle then you know they can all just
fall<00:03:16.730> down<00:03:16.760> like<00:03:17.180> that<00:03:17.860> instead<00:03:18.860> of<00:03:18.920> needed<00:03:19.430> to

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
fall down like that instead of needed to

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:26.050 
fall down like that instead of needed to
just<00:03:20.060> you<00:03:20.420> know<00:03:21.640> shoot<00:03:22.640> all<00:03:22.880> now<00:03:24.910> just<00:03:25.910> over

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
just you know shoot all now just over

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.760 
just you know shoot all now just over
him<00:03:26.950> so<00:03:27.950> now<00:03:28.850> I'm<00:03:29.060> probably<00:03:29.390> gonna<00:03:29.870> aim<00:03:30.200> like<00:03:30.560> a

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
him so now I'm probably gonna aim like a

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.440 
him so now I'm probably gonna aim like a
little<00:03:31.100> bit<00:03:31.310> to<00:03:31.490> the<00:03:31.610> side<00:03:31.910> of<00:03:31.970> him<00:03:32.710> like<00:03:33.710> that

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
little bit to the side of him like that

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:46.000 
little bit to the side of him like that
so<00:03:35.450> then<00:03:35.840> I<00:03:36.230> can<00:03:37.750> have<00:03:39.790> that<00:03:40.790> happen<00:03:44.800> take<00:03:45.800> out

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
so then I can have that happen take out

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.460 
so then I can have that happen take out
the<00:03:46.040> bull<00:03:46.370> right<00:03:46.610> there<00:03:47.200> because<00:03:48.200> it's

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
the bull right there because it's

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.470 
the bull right there because it's
something<00:03:48.710> if<00:03:49.130> there's<00:03:49.610> only<00:03:49.670> like<00:03:49.850> one<00:03:50.000> bowl

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
something if there's only like one bowl

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.310 
something if there's only like one bowl
you<00:03:50.900> know<00:03:52.360> that's<00:03:53.360> like<00:03:53.690> when<00:03:53.840> you<00:03:53.930> do<00:03:54.050> it<00:03:54.200> and

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
you know that's like when you do it and

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.500 
you know that's like when you do it and
they're<00:03:54.620> especially<00:03:55.070> since<00:03:55.520> it's<00:03:55.700> wood<00:03:56.090> and

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
they're especially since it's wood and

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.740 
they're especially since it's wood and
it's<00:03:57.020> holding<00:03:57.170> it<00:03:57.470> up<00:03:57.970> you<00:03:58.970> really<00:03:59.510> really

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
it's holding it up you really really

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.570 
it's holding it up you really really
should<00:04:00.020> try<00:04:00.620> to<00:04:00.770> hit<00:04:01.160> the<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:02.690> wood<00:04:02.960> part<00:04:03.580> like

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
should try to hit the the wood part like

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:16.990 
should try to hit the the wood part like
I<00:04:04.730> did<00:04:10.360> not<00:04:11.360> eat<00:04:15.340> especially<00:04:16.340> since<00:04:16.790> either

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
I did not eat especially since either

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.020 
I did not eat especially since either
solid<00:04:17.770> solid<00:04:18.880> rock<00:04:19.880> it's<00:04:20.780> probably<00:04:21.230> gonna<00:04:21.410> be

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
solid solid rock it's probably gonna be

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.840 
solid solid rock it's probably gonna be
harder<00:04:23.030> to<00:04:23.350> you<00:04:24.350> know<00:04:24.470> knocking<00:04:24.860> down<00:04:25.250> so<00:04:25.610> this

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
harder to you know knocking down so this

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.940 
harder to you know knocking down so this
is<00:04:26.590> especially<00:04:28.540> when<00:04:29.540> just<00:04:30.350> want<00:04:30.560> to<00:04:30.680> aim<00:04:30.920> for

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
is especially when just want to aim for

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.920 
and they're finally we get him down and
