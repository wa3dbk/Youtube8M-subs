00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.290
 afraid I'm afraid I want to know 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.579
 how game is the bad thing do not know how to play 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:07.229
 perfectly 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.229
 but good let's go we can 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.469
 only if they are alone 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.469
 no way 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:16.469
 set 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.670
 good recovery 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:29.899
 and only touré let's go yes sir first shot 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.250
 on goal and we scored well then I did 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:33.500
 very well with touré what happens is that 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.000
 was unlucky and his defense 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.100
 collided now has to be mikel in 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.960
 the shit 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.920
 is that if done well forward but I know 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.920
 that your defenses have crashed 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:51.590
 but there's really yes he said is that you're going 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.590
 walking we the ass 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.170

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.370
 clear in the second part defined a 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.620
 little better than in the first but 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.450

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.170
 against mikel in the turn now I get 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.670
 the lonely leader of the help so 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.050
 we would be leaders in the solitary both 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.070
 in help like in the league away boy 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.470
 it is very important for the next 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.790
 party that we have also good the day 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.140
 of the match thus matched as to 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.490
 shots also position the thanks that 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.320
 I was more precise in the passes 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.850
 here you have 84 percent 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.410
 mikel especially had it in sep in 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:06.100

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:07.960
 failures and there were already was 5 13-0 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.730
 but this is still nothing in fact 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.900
