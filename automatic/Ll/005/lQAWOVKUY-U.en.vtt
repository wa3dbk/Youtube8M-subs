see here this piece of gravity particle
that<00:00:44.190> shows<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.520> lot<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.820> those<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.210> by<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.450> webs

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
that shows a lot of those is by the webs

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.959 
that shows a lot of those is by the webs
we're<00:00:46.739> going<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.980> use<00:00:47.100> on<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.520> one<00:00:47.789> because

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
we're going to use on this one because

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.010 
we're going to use on this one because
it's<00:00:48.270> dark<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.719> color<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:50.180> factor<00:00:51.180> black<00:00:51.449> as<00:00:51.750> a

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
it's dark in color the factor black as a

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.240 
it's dark in color the factor black as a
matter<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.289> fact<00:00:52.469> we're<00:00:52.620> going<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.829> divide<00:00:53.039> the

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
matter of fact we're going to divide the

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.160 
matter of fact we're going to divide the
certain<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.670> surface<00:00:54.090> in<00:00:54.239> half<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.750> apply

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
certain the surface in half and apply

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.010 
certain the surface in half and apply
the<00:00:55.230> factor<00:00:55.680> black<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.699> backdrop<00:00:57.629> black<00:00:57.840> is

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
the factor black the backdrop black is

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.410 
the factor black the backdrop black is
going<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.230> go<00:00:58.350> into<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.680> fissures<00:00:59.160> and

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
going to go into the fissures and

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.510 
going to go into the fissures and
basically<00:01:00.420> paint<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.530> walls<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.129> fissure

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
basically paint the walls of the fissure

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.080 
basically paint the walls of the fissure
itself<00:01:02.940> in<00:01:04.040> church<00:01:05.040> injuring<00:01:05.460> car<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:05.970> make

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
itself in church injuring car and make

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.179 
itself in church injuring car and make
it<00:01:06.119> done<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.630> basically<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.350> end<00:01:07.470> up<00:01:07.590> seeing<00:01:07.950> a

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
it done so basically you end up seeing a

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.010 
it done so basically you end up seeing a
less<00:01:08.430> they're<00:01:08.700> physically<00:01:09.270> still<00:01:09.570> there<00:01:09.869> in

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
less they're physically still there in

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.480 
less they're physically still there in
the<00:01:10.049> material<00:01:10.560> they're<00:01:10.920> going<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.130> be<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.250> lot

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
the material they're going to be a lot

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.730 
the material they're going to be a lot
less<00:01:11.729> visible<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.450> that's<00:01:13.170> that's<00:01:13.500> basically

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
less visible so that's that's basically

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.910 
less visible so that's that's basically
how<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.220> works<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:15.600> way<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.049> recommend<00:01:16.439> to

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
how it works the way I recommend to

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.039 
how it works the way I recommend to
apply<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.280> material<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.390> pour<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.930> and

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
apply this material is to pour it and

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.649 
apply this material is to pour it and
spread<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:19.950> usually<00:01:20.340> use<00:01:21.210> one<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.450> those

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
spread it I usually use one of those

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.260 
spread it I usually use one of those
cards<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.290> key<00:01:22.590> card<00:01:22.830> for<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.670> hotel<00:01:23.970> room

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
cards is a key card for the hotel room

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.260 
cards is a key card for the hotel room
and<00:01:24.590> basically<00:01:25.590> apply<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.130> over<00:01:26.549> spread<00:01:27.119> it

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
and basically apply this over spread it

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.870 
and basically apply this over spread it
then<00:01:27.540> let<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.439> evaporate<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:29.700> solvent

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
then let it evaporate the solvent

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.630 
then let it evaporate the solvent
evaporates<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.869> leaves<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.829> film<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.369> dark

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
evaporates and leaves the film a dark

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.670 
evaporates and leaves the film a dark
film<00:01:32.939> on<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.210> material<00:01:33.689> we<00:01:34.229> then<00:01:34.409> going<00:01:34.590> to

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
film on the material we then going to

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.710 
film on the material we then going to
remove<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.130> we<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.759> know<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:35.909> have<00:01:36.270> some<00:01:36.509> paper

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
remove it we you know I have some paper

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.440 
remove it we you know I have some paper
towel<00:01:36.990> here<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.530> can<00:01:37.710> use<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.189> steel<00:01:38.909> wall<00:01:39.210> if

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
towel here you can use a steel wall if

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.600 
towel here you can use a steel wall if
you<00:01:39.600> have<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.900> available<00:01:40.079> but<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.220> really

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
you have it available but it is really

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.980 
you have it available but it is really
easy<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:42.030> remove<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.570> you're<00:01:42.689> going<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.869> see

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
easy to remove and you're going to see

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.350 
easy to remove and you're going to see
the<00:01:43.110> difference<00:01:43.470> between<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.950> two<00:01:44.130> sides<00:01:45.119> of

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
the difference between the two sides of

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.810 
the difference between the two sides of
the<00:01:45.420> granite<00:01:45.810> one<00:01:46.409> side<00:01:46.770> being<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.280> lot<00:01:47.549> more

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
the granite one side being a lot more

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.149 
the granite one side being a lot more
uniform<00:01:48.509> less<00:01:48.899> pictures<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.710> gather<00:01:49.890> one

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
uniform less pictures and gather one

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.750 
uniform less pictures and gather one
it's<00:01:50.759> what<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.090> is

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
it's what it is

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.780 
it's what it is
so<00:01:52.480> let's<00:01:52.810> proceed<00:01:53.160> again<00:01:54.160> you<00:01:54.370> have<00:01:54.550> your

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
so let's proceed again you have your

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.780 
so let's proceed again you have your
detector<00:01:55.360> black<00:01:55.660> on<00:01:56.200> my<00:01:56.470> right<00:01:56.740> and<00:01:57.040> you<00:01:57.610> have

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
detector black on my right and you have

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.470 
detector black on my right and you have
the<00:01:57.970> fact<00:01:58.180> for<00:01:58.420> clear<00:01:58.660> on<00:01:58.870> my<00:01:59.050> left<00:01:59.970> okay<00:02:00.970> now

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
the fact for clear on my left okay now

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.940 
the fact for clear on my left okay now
we're<00:02:01.630> going<00:02:01.750> to<00:02:01.870> apply<00:02:02.020> it<00:02:02.140> on<00:02:02.440> this<00:02:02.680> side<00:02:02.920> of

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
we're going to apply it on this side of

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.860 
we're going to apply it on this side of
the<00:02:03.160> granite<00:02:03.520> we're<00:02:03.970> going<00:02:04.150> to<00:02:04.210> have<00:02:04.420> some

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
the granite we're going to have some

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.750 
the granite we're going to have some
tetra<00:02:05.320> black<00:02:05.590> like<00:02:05.980> I<00:02:06.070> said<00:02:06.220> the<00:02:06.310> best<00:02:06.520> way<00:02:06.700> is

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
tetra black like I said the best way is

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.220 
tetra black like I said the best way is
to<00:02:06.850> just<00:02:07.000> pour<00:02:07.540> it<00:02:07.660> they're<00:02:07.780> going<00:02:07.870> to<00:02:07.930> be<00:02:08.020> very

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.230 
to just pour it they're going to be very

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:10.590 
to just pour it they're going to be very
careful<00:02:08.680> here<00:02:08.920> for<00:02:09.790> a<00:02:09.820> straight<00:02:10.270> onto<00:02:10.420> the

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
careful here for a straight onto the

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.620 
careful here for a straight onto the
material<00:02:11.110> and<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:12.790> want<00:02:12.970> to<00:02:13.030> make<00:02:13.150> sure<00:02:13.180> that

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
material and you want to make sure that

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.470 
material and you want to make sure that
you<00:02:14.290> actually<00:02:14.440> saturate<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.370> stone<00:02:15.610> I'm

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
you actually saturate the stone I'm

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.120 
you actually saturate the stone I'm
going<00:02:16.750> to<00:02:16.840> use<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.080> card<00:02:17.380> like<00:02:17.650> we<00:02:17.770> discussed

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
going to use the card like we discussed

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.130 
going to use the card like we discussed
and<00:02:19.200> just<00:02:20.200> you<00:02:20.410> know<00:02:20.470> evenly<00:02:21.040> spread<00:02:21.550> it<00:02:22.140> the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
and just you know evenly spread it the

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.260 
and just you know evenly spread it the
solvent<00:02:23.710> here<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.220> very<00:02:24.430> thing<00:02:24.730> is<00:02:24.850> solvent

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
solvent here the very thing is solvent

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.950 
solvent here the very thing is solvent
is<00:02:25.360> going<00:02:25.600> to<00:02:25.690> leave<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.920> mixture<00:02:27.370> and<00:02:27.580> thus

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
is going to leave the mixture and thus

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.580 
is going to leave the mixture and thus
you<00:02:28.960> can<00:02:29.140> end<00:02:29.290> up<00:02:29.410> with<00:02:29.470> a<00:02:29.790> sticky<00:02:30.790> surface<00:02:31.590> the

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
you can end up with a sticky surface the

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.530 
you can end up with a sticky surface the
sticky<00:02:32.980> surface<00:02:33.460> is<00:02:33.610> totally<00:02:34.090> normal

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
sticky surface is totally normal

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.960 
sticky surface is totally normal
you're<00:02:35.410> going<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.620> remove<00:02:35.890> all<00:02:36.160> of<00:02:36.460> it<00:02:36.580> later

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
you're going to remove all of it later

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.180 
you're going to remove all of it later
on<00:02:37.060> with<00:02:37.420> either<00:02:37.540> steel<00:02:37.960> wall<00:02:38.290> or<00:02:38.590> table<00:02:38.830> top

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
on with either steel wall or table top

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.040 
on with either steel wall or table top
so<00:02:39.430> we're<00:02:39.880> going<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.060> let<00:02:40.150> us<00:02:40.300> sit<00:02:40.540> here<00:02:40.810> for<00:02:41.020> a

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
so we're going to let us sit here for a

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.240 
so we're going to let us sit here for a
little<00:02:41.110> while<00:02:41.500> and<00:02:43.830> you're<00:02:44.830> going<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:45.100> see

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
little while and you're going to see

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.510 
little while and you're going to see
that<00:02:45.370> when<00:02:45.550> we<00:02:45.790> return<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:47.040> surface<00:02:48.040> kind<00:02:48.310> of

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
that when we return the surface kind of

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.060 
that when we return the surface kind of
sticky<00:02:49.030> but<00:02:49.810> then<00:02:50.020> you<00:02:50.470> see<00:02:50.800> a<00:02:50.830> dramatic

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
sticky but then you see a dramatic

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.160 
sticky but then you see a dramatic
difference<00:02:51.640> between<00:02:52.360> this<00:02:52.540> side<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:52.870> this

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
difference between this side and this

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.460 
difference between this side and this
side

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
side

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:00.210 
side
so<00:02:54.450> wait<00:02:55.450> up<00:02:55.600> for<00:02:55.810> a<00:02:55.840> little<00:02:56.050> bit

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.790 

it's<00:03:00.790> now<00:03:01.000> pretty<00:03:01.300> much<00:03:01.510> set<00:03:02.020> as<00:03:02.350> you<00:03:02.620> can

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
it's now pretty much set as you can

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.340 
it's now pretty much set as you can
probably<00:03:03.100> see<00:03:03.790> it's<00:03:04.180> kind<00:03:04.480> of<00:03:04.600> stinky<00:03:05.110> here

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
probably see it's kind of stinky here

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.800 
probably see it's kind of stinky here
versus<00:03:05.800> here<00:03:05.830> where<00:03:06.190> we<00:03:06.280> have<00:03:06.490> no<00:03:06.700> products<00:03:07.300> so

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
versus here where we have no products so

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.740 
versus here where we have no products so
I'm<00:03:08.620> going<00:03:08.740> to<00:03:08.770> proceed<00:03:09.070> now<00:03:09.100> to<00:03:09.220> remove<00:03:09.670> it<00:03:09.880> in

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
I'm going to proceed now to remove it in

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.600 
I'm going to proceed now to remove it in
am<00:03:10.930> using<00:03:11.440> regular<00:03:11.770> paper<00:03:11.980> towel<00:03:12.340> because

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
am using regular paper towel because

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.550 
am using regular paper towel because
they<00:03:13.030> are<00:03:13.090> available<00:03:13.810> and<00:03:15.960> see<00:03:16.960> immediately

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
they are available and see immediately

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.280 
they are available and see immediately
how<00:03:17.770> this<00:03:18.430> side<00:03:18.730> of<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.360> flap<00:03:19.690> looks<00:03:19.930> a<00:03:20.080> lot

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
how this side of the flap looks a lot

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.680 
how this side of the flap looks a lot
darker<00:03:23.670> I'm<00:03:24.670> going<00:03:24.850> to<00:03:24.910> remove<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.330> rest<00:03:25.480> of

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
darker I'm going to remove the rest of

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:33.240 
darker I'm going to remove the rest of
the<00:03:25.750> excess<00:03:26.140> with<00:03:26.350> a<00:03:26.380> clean<00:03:26.710> rag<00:03:26.920> and<00:03:31.950> all<00:03:32.950> the

the excess with a clean rag and all the
fissures<00:03:33.760> and<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:34.030> spiderwebs<00:03:34.570> are<00:03:34.780> gone

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
fissures and the spiderwebs are gone

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.800 
fissures and the spiderwebs are gone
this<00:03:36.250> now<00:03:36.460> looks<00:03:36.700> like<00:03:36.820> a<00:03:36.940> premium<00:03:37.570> quality

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
this now looks like a premium quality

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.670 
this now looks like a premium quality
material<00:03:38.740> this<00:03:38.920> one<00:03:39.160> looks<00:03:39.420> you<00:03:40.420> know

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
material this one looks you know

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.400 
material this one looks you know
marginal<00:03:41.680> third<00:03:42.610> choice<00:03:43.060> another<00:03:43.750> problem<00:03:44.140> is

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
marginal third choice another problem is

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.530 
marginal third choice another problem is
also<00:03:44.590> if<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.460> homeowner<00:03:45.880> is<00:03:46.060> looking<00:03:46.420> at<00:03:46.510> a

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
also if the homeowner is looking at a

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.680 
also if the homeowner is looking at a
slab<00:03:46.870> in<00:03:46.900> a<00:03:47.170> yard<00:03:47.470> it<00:03:48.130> would<00:03:48.280> typically<00:03:48.700> be<00:03:48.820> you

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
slab in a yard it would typically be you

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.040 
slab in a yard it would typically be you
know<00:03:49.840> more<00:03:50.160> wet<00:03:51.160> than<00:03:51.520> what<00:03:52.360> you<00:03:52.540> have<00:03:52.810> in<00:03:52.840> a

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
know more wet than what you have in a

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.410 
know more wet than what you have in a
house<00:03:53.290> after<00:03:53.770> a<00:03:53.800> few<00:03:54.130> weeks<00:03:54.280> after<00:03:55.090> the

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
house after a few weeks after the

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.870 
house after a few weeks after the
installation<00:03:55.780> so<00:03:56.650> something<00:03:57.490> that<00:03:57.640> looks

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
installation so something that looks

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.520 
installation so something that looks
like<00:03:58.000> this<00:03:58.270> in<00:03:58.510> the<00:03:58.600> yard<00:03:58.810> it's<00:03:59.170> gonna<00:03:59.290> end<00:03:59.410> up

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
like this in the yard it's gonna end up

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.890 
like this in the yard it's gonna end up
looking<00:03:59.590> like<00:04:00.010> this<00:04:00.280> in<00:04:00.460> somebody's<00:04:00.670> house<00:04:01.090> we

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
looking like this in somebody's house we

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.420 
looking like this in somebody's house we
just<00:04:02.080> later<00:04:02.320> up<00:04:02.500> and<00:04:02.710> all<00:04:02.800> the<00:04:02.950> water<00:04:03.190> has

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
just later up and all the water has

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.320 
just later up and all the water has
evaporated<00:04:04.440> so<00:04:05.520> this<00:04:06.520> just<00:04:06.790> gives<00:04:07.120> you<00:04:07.300> a

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
evaporated so this just gives you a
