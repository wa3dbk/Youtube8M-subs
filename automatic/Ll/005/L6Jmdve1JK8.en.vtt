hi<00:00:00.780> everybody<00:00:01.110> today<00:00:01.469> I<00:00:01.740> will<00:00:01.860> show<00:00:02.100> you<00:00:02.280> how

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
hi everybody today I will show you how

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.190 
hi everybody today I will show you how
to<00:00:02.820> use<00:00:03.149> sinful<00:00:03.990> eyes<00:00:04.549> okay<00:00:05.549> simple<00:00:06.060> ice<00:00:06.750> cube

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
to use sinful eyes okay simple ice cube

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.879 
to use sinful eyes okay simple ice cube
is<00:00:07.410> a<00:00:07.770> free<00:00:08.189> energy<00:00:08.460> generator<00:00:09.500> for<00:00:10.500> this

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
is a free energy generator for this

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.400 
is a free energy generator for this
Stirling<00:00:11.670> engine<00:00:12.030> this<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.719> very<00:00:12.929> simple

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
Stirling engine this is very simple

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.189 
Stirling engine this is very simple
Stirling<00:00:13.950> engine<00:00:14.429> you<00:00:15.210> can<00:00:15.420> see<00:00:15.630> when<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.080> start

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
Stirling engine you can see when I start

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.070 
Stirling engine you can see when I start
the<00:00:16.619> engine<00:00:16.800> without<00:00:17.160> eyes<00:00:17.609> it's<00:00:18.300> not<00:00:18.420> working

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
the engine without eyes it's not working

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.570 
the engine without eyes it's not working
it's<00:00:19.289> not<00:00:19.410> operating<00:00:20.420> okay<00:00:22.039> it<00:00:23.039> operates

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
it's not operating okay it operates

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.950 
it's not operating okay it operates
based<00:00:24.480> on<00:00:25.490> its<00:00:26.490> operation<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.330> based<00:00:27.660> on

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
based on its operation is based on

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.560 
based on its operation is based on
difference<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.949> temperature<00:00:29.240> between<00:00:30.240> this

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
difference of temperature between this

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.860 
difference of temperature between this
down<00:00:31.349> side<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.009> this<00:00:32.279> upper<00:00:32.730> side<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.300> engine

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
down side and this upper side of engine

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.020 
down side and this upper side of engine
so<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.590> difference<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.250> temperature<00:00:35.460> is

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
so the difference of temperature is

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.910 
so the difference of temperature is
causing<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.899> rotation<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:38.430> let's<00:00:39.360> try<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
causing the rotation so let's try the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.040 
causing the rotation so let's try the
experiment<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.129> will<00:00:41.280> put<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:42.270> Stirling

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
experiment I will put this Stirling

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.020 
experiment I will put this Stirling
engine<00:00:43.559> on<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.700> eyes<00:00:44.940> okay

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
engine on the eyes okay

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.520 
engine on the eyes okay
it<00:00:48.030> takes<00:00:48.360> maybe<00:00:49.079> 10<00:00:50.010> seconds<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:51.140> the<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
it takes maybe 10 seconds and the the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.959 
it takes maybe 10 seconds and the the
down<00:00:53.399> side<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.649> engine<00:00:55.649> gets<00:00:56.100> colder<00:00:56.610> and

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
down side of the engine gets colder and

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.000 
down side of the engine gets colder and
now<00:00:57.539> let's<00:00:58.140> try<00:00:58.440> what<00:00:58.859> will<00:00:59.010> happen<00:00:59.989> okay<00:01:01.020> you

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
now let's try what will happen okay you

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.140 
now let's try what will happen okay you
can<00:01:02.160> see<00:01:02.420> it's<00:01:03.420> already<00:01:03.989> after<00:01:04.739> 10<00:01:05.189> 15<00:01:05.580> minutes

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
can see it's already after 10 15 minutes

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.120 
can see it's already after 10 15 minutes
it<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.420> starting<00:01:07.080> its<00:01:07.350> operation<00:01:07.979> and

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
it is starting its operation and

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:16.700 
it is starting its operation and
rotation<00:01:08.780> ok<00:01:11.360> you<00:01:12.360> can<00:01:12.540> see<00:01:14.509> the<00:01:15.509> rotation<00:01:15.710> is

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
rotation ok you can see the rotation is

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.390 
rotation ok you can see the rotation is
already<00:01:17.250> for<00:01:17.460> kink<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.509> only<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.470> eyes<00:01:19.920> and

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
already for kink so only the eyes and

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.530 
already for kink so only the eyes and
the<00:01:20.820> cold<00:01:21.060> temperature<00:01:21.780> from<00:01:22.140> down<00:01:22.470> side<00:01:22.799> is

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
the cold temperature from down side is

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.499 
the cold temperature from down side is
enough<00:01:24.540> for<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.409> rotation<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.509> simple

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
enough for the rotation of this simple

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.980 
enough for the rotation of this simple
Stirling<00:01:28.259> engine<00:01:28.820> in<00:01:30.140> maybe<00:01:31.579> 30<00:01:32.579> seconds<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
Stirling engine in maybe 30 seconds the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.530 
Stirling engine in maybe 30 seconds the
rotation<00:01:34.590> until<00:01:34.829> even<00:01:35.310> improve<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:36.210> will<00:01:36.360> come

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
rotation until even improve it will come

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.700 
rotation until even improve it will come
even<00:01:36.810> faster<00:01:38.329> because<00:01:39.329> this<00:01:39.900> dance<00:01:40.380> until

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
even faster because this dance until

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.600 
even faster because this dance until
getting<00:01:41.220> colder<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.759> colder<00:01:41.990> so<00:01:43.280> this<00:01:44.280> engine

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
getting colder and colder so this engine

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.600 
getting colder and colder so this engine
is<00:01:45.060> really<00:01:45.750> interesting<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.530> operation<00:01:47.460> is

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
is really interesting that operation is

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.740 
is really interesting that operation is
quite<00:01:48.530> interesting<00:01:49.530> can<00:01:49.799> see<00:01:49.979> how<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.280> works

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
quite interesting can see how it works

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.749 
quite interesting can see how it works
ok<00:01:52.340> is<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.549> simple<00:01:54.439> presentation<00:01:55.439> how<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.399> use

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
ok is the simple presentation how to use

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.289 
ok is the simple presentation how to use
the<00:01:57.060> eyes<00:01:57.299> as<00:01:57.659> free<00:01:58.079> energy<00:01:58.549> for<00:01:59.549> Elise<00:01:59.820> still

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
the eyes as free energy for Elise still

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.469 
the eyes as free energy for Elise still
amazing<00:02:00.899> ice<00:02:01.799> can<00:02:02.280> be<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.850> can<00:02:03.060> get<00:02:03.210> ice

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
amazing ice can be you can get ice

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.840 
amazing ice can be you can get ice
everywhere<00:02:04.219> outside<00:02:05.219> when<00:02:05.460> it's<00:02:05.579> cold

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
everywhere outside when it's cold

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.190 
everywhere outside when it's cold
outside<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.439> it's<00:02:07.439> quite<00:02:07.710> for<00:02:08.009> free<00:02:08.810> ok<00:02:09.810> this

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
outside so it's quite for free ok this

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.160 
outside so it's quite for free ok this
is<00:02:10.379> all<00:02:10.530> for<00:02:10.830> today
