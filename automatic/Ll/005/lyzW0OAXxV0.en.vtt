be very easy to forget that you have
this<00:04:18.680> only<00:04:20.260> now<00:04:21.260> the<00:04:21.320> Hulk's<00:04:21.950> bill<00:04:22.190> to<00:04:22.670> me<00:04:23.200> this

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
this only now the Hulk's bill to me this

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.500 
this only now the Hulk's bill to me this
is<00:04:24.380> an<00:04:24.500> obvious<00:04:24.880> self-defense<00:04:25.880> night<00:04:26.120> this

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
is an obvious self-defense night this

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.240 
is an obvious self-defense night this
looks<00:04:26.990> very<00:04:27.260> much<00:04:27.890> like<00:04:27.920> the<00:04:28.250> Quran<00:04:28.520> bear<00:04:30.250> so

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
looks very much like the Quran bear so

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.520 
looks very much like the Quran bear so
once<00:04:31.460> you<00:04:31.610> saw<00:04:31.760> me<00:04:31.820> fingers<00:04:32.240> that's<00:04:33.200> not<00:04:33.380> going

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
to come off you're not going to lose

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.370 
to come off you're not going to lose
this<00:04:36.340> so<00:04:37.340> I<00:04:37.640> would<00:04:37.820> see<00:04:38.030> this<00:04:38.210> definitely<00:04:38.750> SI<00:04:39.140> a

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
this so I would see this definitely SI a

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.290 
this so I would see this definitely SI a
defensive<00:04:40.340> knife<00:04:40.750> very<00:04:41.750> crammed<00:04:42.170> it<00:04:42.320> like

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
defensive knife very crammed it like

they are razor sharp these knives they

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.530 
they are razor sharp these knives they
