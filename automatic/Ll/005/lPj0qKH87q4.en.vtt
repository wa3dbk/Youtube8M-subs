the<00:00:13.620> tire<00:00:13.860> pressure<00:00:14.250> is<00:00:14.670> very<00:00:14.910> important<00:00:15.540> for

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
the tire pressure is very important for

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.950 
the tire pressure is very important for
the<00:00:16.289> safety<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:17.190> vehicle<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:18.029> also<00:00:18.180> for

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
the safety of the vehicle and also for

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.890 
the safety of the vehicle and also for
the<00:00:19.350> fuel<00:00:20.070> consumption<00:00:20.520> right<00:00:20.820> if<00:00:21.180> your<00:00:21.570> tire

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
the fuel consumption right if your tire

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.920 
the fuel consumption right if your tire
is<00:00:21.930> not<00:00:22.289> inflated<00:00:22.740> properly<00:00:23.580> you<00:00:24.390> may<00:00:24.539> more

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
is not inflated properly you may more

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.500 
is not inflated properly you may more
use<00:00:25.350> more<00:00:25.650> gas<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.220> then<00:00:26.820> it's<00:00:27.029> also<00:00:27.269> and

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
use more gas and then it's also and

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.750 
use more gas and then it's also and
safer<00:00:27.990> for<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.289> vehicle<00:00:28.740> so<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.460> want<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.670> be

safe so at least once a month you should

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.130 
safe so at least once a month you should
check<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.910> tire<00:00:33.120> pressure<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.690> make<00:00:33.960> sure

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
check the tire pressure and make sure

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.830 
check the tire pressure and make sure
you<00:00:34.320> inflate<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.460> proper<00:00:36.420> pressure

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
you inflate it to the proper pressure

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.920
