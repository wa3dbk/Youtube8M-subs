you want to keep a slimmer physique
year-round<00:04:18.150> and<00:04:18.660> gain<00:04:19.080> strength<00:04:19.440> I<00:04:19.680> can<00:04:19.709> tell

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
year-round and gain strength I can tell

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.920 
year-round and gain strength I can tell
you<00:04:20.400> it's<00:04:20.520> possible<00:04:20.730> if<00:04:21.299> you<00:04:21.510> increase<00:04:21.810> your

you it's possible if you increase your

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.200 
you it's possible if you increase your
calories<00:04:22.410> will<00:04:22.980> you<00:04:23.250> get<00:04:23.430> stronger<00:04:23.760> quicker

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
calories will you get stronger quicker

name enough to look it up and he

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.150 
name enough to look it up and he
basically<00:06:39.990> is<00:06:40.230> the<00:06:40.290> same<00:06:40.530> weight<00:06:40.740> as<00:06:40.890> me

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 
basically is the same weight as me

basically is the same weight as me
and<00:06:41.250> I<00:06:42.090> believe<00:06:42.780> this<00:06:42.870> bench<00:06:43.200> is<00:06:43.350> a<00:06:43.410> little<00:06:43.740> bit

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:43.830 
and I believe this bench is a little bit

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.340 
and I believe this bench is a little bit
stronger<00:06:44.160> than<00:06:44.250> mine<00:06:44.570> but<00:06:45.570> maybe<00:06:45.840> our<00:06:45.990> squat

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:46.350 
stronger than mine but maybe our squat

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:48.230 
stronger than mine but maybe our squat
might<00:06:46.680> be<00:06:46.770> the<00:06:46.890> same<00:06:47.190> I<00:06:47.520> might<00:06:47.880> beat<00:06:48.090> him<00:06:48.210> a

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 
might be the same I might beat him a

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.370 
might be the same I might beat him a
little<00:06:48.480> bit<00:06:48.540> in<00:06:48.600> squatting<00:06:48.930> I'm<00:06:48.990> beat<00:06:49.230> him<00:06:49.350> a

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.380 
little bit in squatting I'm beat him a

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.620 
little bit in squatting I'm beat him a
little<00:06:49.650> bit<00:06:49.710> in<00:06:49.770> deadlift<00:06:50.100> but<00:06:50.250> uh<00:06:50.820> you<00:06:51.540> know

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:11.540 
superior usually but there's a guy that
I<00:07:10.440> might<00:07:10.620> train<00:07:10.830> with<00:07:11.010> to<00:07:11.100> help<00:07:11.190> me<00:07:11.280> out<00:07:11.340> of<00:07:11.490> my

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:11.550 
I might train with to help me out of my

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.040 
I might train with to help me out of my
bench<00:07:11.760> that<00:07:12.270> he's<00:07:12.480> actually<00:07:12.720> competing<00:07:12.990> the

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.050 
bench that he's actually competing the

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.080 
bench that he's actually competing the
same<00:07:13.260> meet<00:07:13.470> same<00:07:13.830> weight<00:07:13.980> class<00:07:14.010> and<00:07:14.490> is<00:07:14.910> very
