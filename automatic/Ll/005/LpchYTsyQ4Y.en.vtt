00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.009 
out at all now that she's broken she's
definitely<00:04:17.760> going<00:04:18.030> in<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.180> trash<00:04:18.799> but<00:04:20.989> so<00:04:21.989> I

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
definitely going in the trash but so I

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.790 
definitely going in the trash but so I
would<00:04:22.349> say<00:04:23.599> that<00:04:24.599> this<00:04:24.750> is<00:04:24.810> not<00:04:25.289> good<00:04:25.770> for

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
would say that this is not good for

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.800 
would say that this is not good for
little<00:04:26.280> kids<00:04:26.460> to<00:04:26.610> paint<00:04:26.970> at<00:04:27.210> all<00:04:27.330> cuz<00:04:27.630> it's

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
little kids to paint at all cuz it's

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.680 
little kids to paint at all cuz it's
super<00:04:28.260> difficult<00:04:28.470> if<00:04:28.950> you<00:04:29.400> love<00:04:29.760> painting<00:04:30.270> and

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
super difficult if you love painting and

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.320 
super difficult if you love painting and
you<00:04:30.810> have<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:31.169> patience<00:04:31.860> then<00:04:32.640> this<00:04:32.909> would<00:04:33.180> be

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
you have the patience then this would be

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.290 
you have the patience then this would be
better<00:04:33.510> for<00:04:33.659> like<00:04:34.159> older<00:04:35.159> kids<00:04:35.490> and<00:04:35.849> teenagers

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
better for like older kids and teenagers

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.170 
better for like older kids and teenagers
and<00:04:37.669> you<00:04:38.669> know<00:04:38.840> but<00:04:39.840> little<00:04:40.289> kids<00:04:40.650> no<00:04:41.310> I<00:04:41.640> think

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
and you know but little kids no I think

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.390 
and you know but little kids no I think
anybody<00:04:42.750> under<00:04:43.140> 10<00:04:43.440> would<00:04:43.710> have<00:04:43.890> a<00:04:43.919> hard<00:04:44.190> time

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
anybody under 10 would have a hard time

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.560 
anybody under 10 would have a hard time
painting<00:04:44.789> this<00:04:46.340> the<00:04:47.340> 3d<00:04:47.789> image<00:04:48.060> is<00:04:48.210> really

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
painting this the 3d image is really

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.110 
painting this the 3d image is really
nice<00:04:48.870> but<00:04:49.169> it<00:04:49.260> is<00:04:49.409> so<00:04:49.860> difficult<00:04:50.220> to<00:04:50.520> paint<00:04:50.820> I

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
nice but it is so difficult to paint I

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.730 
nice but it is so difficult to paint I
had<00:04:52.080> to<00:04:52.260> do<00:04:52.440> at<00:04:52.710> least<00:04:52.740> two<00:04:53.220> coats<00:04:53.640> and<00:04:54.620> to<00:04:55.620> be

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
had to do at least two coats and to be

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.120 
had to do at least two coats and to be
honest<00:04:56.070> I<00:04:56.159> think<00:04:56.220> I<00:04:56.430> did<00:04:56.610> probably<00:04:57.180> three

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
honest I think I did probably three

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.860 
honest I think I did probably three
closer<00:04:59.130> to<00:04:59.460> three<00:04:59.760> because<00:05:00.060> I<00:05:00.180> kept<00:05:00.419> going<00:05:00.570> and

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
closer to three because I kept going and

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.990 
closer to three because I kept going and
going<00:05:01.169> and<00:05:01.260> going<00:05:01.970> so<00:05:02.970> I'm<00:05:03.960> not<00:05:04.169> happy<00:05:05.000> with

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
going and going so I'm not happy with

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.600 
going and going so I'm not happy with
how<00:05:06.180> it<00:05:06.330> turned<00:05:06.360> out<00:05:06.810> I<00:05:07.260> did<00:05:08.190> think<00:05:08.370> it<00:05:08.490> was

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
how it turned out I did think it was

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.540 
how it turned out I did think it was
frustrating<00:05:09.409> even<00:05:10.409> though<00:05:10.710> I<00:05:10.740> like<00:05:11.190> to<00:05:11.340> think

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
frustrating even though I like to think

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.700 
frustrating even though I like to think
of<00:05:11.610> myself<00:05:11.820> as<00:05:12.210> having<00:05:12.630> some<00:05:12.900> patience<00:05:13.560> at

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
of myself as having some patience at

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.659 
of myself as having some patience at
least<00:05:15.200> it<00:05:16.200> was<00:05:16.409> hard<00:05:16.650> even<00:05:16.830> for<00:05:16.979> me<00:05:17.190> to<00:05:17.490> deal

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
least it was hard even for me to deal

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:21.560 
least it was hard even for me to deal
with<00:05:18.620> so<00:05:19.620> it<00:05:19.919> looks<00:05:20.099> okay<00:05:20.490> now<00:05:20.820> on<00:05:21.030> camera<00:05:21.419> as

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
with so it looks okay now on camera as

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.959 
with so it looks okay now on camera as
I'm<00:05:21.690> looking<00:05:21.810> at<00:05:22.140> it<00:05:22.320> but<00:05:22.469> in<00:05:22.860> real<00:05:23.400> life<00:05:23.460> it's

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:23.969 
I'm looking at it but in real life it's

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:27.500 
I'm looking at it but in real life it's
not<00:05:24.240> it<00:05:24.659> doesn't<00:05:25.020> look<00:05:25.169> good<00:05:25.349> at<00:05:25.500> all<00:05:26.510> so

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
not it doesn't look good at all so

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.310 
not it doesn't look good at all so
anyway<00:05:27.990> that's<00:05:28.229> my<00:05:28.650> opinion<00:05:29.310> of<00:05:29.520> these

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
anyway that's my opinion of these

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.969 
anyway that's my opinion of these
adorable<00:05:31.320> painting<00:05:32.159> kids<00:05:33.229> so<00:05:34.229> I<00:05:34.260> wanted<00:05:34.919> to

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
adorable painting kids so I wanted to

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:37.219 
adorable painting kids so I wanted to
upload<00:05:35.580> something<00:05:35.940> that<00:05:36.300> was<00:05:36.450> an<00:05:36.570> epic<00:05:36.900> fail

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
upload something that was an epic fail

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:40.120 
upload something that was an epic fail
because<00:05:37.469> I<00:05:37.740> think<00:05:37.800> that's<00:05:38.099> also<00:05:38.610> fair<00:05:38.969> to<00:05:39.000> do

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
because I think that's also fair to do

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.880 
because I think that's also fair to do
so<00:05:41.130> let's<00:05:41.640> see<00:05:41.969> out<00:05:42.210> of<00:05:42.390> five<00:05:42.690> stars<00:05:43.320> I<00:05:43.740> would

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 
so let's see out of five stars I would

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.640 
so let's see out of five stars I would
probably<00:05:44.159> give<00:05:44.610> it<00:05:44.640> three<00:05:45.090> stars<00:05:45.530> because<00:05:46.530> it

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
probably give it three stars because it

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.459 
probably give it three stars because it
was<00:05:46.770> kind<00:05:47.700> of<00:05:47.940> fun<00:05:48.180> to<00:05:48.210> paint<00:05:48.539> at<00:05:48.840> first<00:05:49.140> and

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:49.469 
was kind of fun to paint at first and

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:55.250 
was kind of fun to paint at first and
then<00:05:50.010> it<00:05:50.039> got<00:05:50.340> frustrating<00:05:51.169> and<00:05:53.930> yeah<00:05:54.930> that

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:55.260 
then it got frustrating and yeah that

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.760 
then it got frustrating and yeah that
would<00:05:55.380> be<00:05:55.530> that<00:05:55.919> would<00:05:56.010> be<00:05:56.070> my<00:05:56.310> opinion<00:05:57.200> so<00:05:58.200> I

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
would be that would be my opinion so I

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.709 
would be that would be my opinion so I
went<00:05:59.190> from<00:05:59.370> happy<00:05:59.640> to<00:05:59.820> have<00:06:00.120> it<00:06:00.150> and<00:06:00.450> couldn't

00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:00.719 
went from happy to have it and couldn't

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:03.230 
went from happy to have it and couldn't
