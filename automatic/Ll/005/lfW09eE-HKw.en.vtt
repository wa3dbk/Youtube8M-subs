00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
and I was just going to say it looked

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.210 
and I was just going to say it looked
like<00:05:15.660> they<00:05:15.870> opened<00:05:16.290> up<00:05:16.350> the<00:05:16.530> slightest<00:05:17.040> bit<00:05:17.160> of

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
like they opened up the slightest bit of

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.030 
like they opened up the slightest bit of
distance<00:05:17.610> on<00:05:17.820> Roxon<00:05:18.300> and<00:05:19.050> about<00:05:19.290> 10<00:05:19.560> seconds

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
distance on Roxon and about 10 seconds
