00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
with the white keys and preferably I

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.070 
with the white keys and preferably I
like<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.789> do<00:00:20.789> with<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.210> metronome<00:00:21.689> but<00:00:21.960> we'll

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
like to do with the metronome but we'll

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.429 
like to do with the metronome but we'll
do<00:00:22.230> without<00:00:22.350> dimensional<00:00:22.890> now<00:00:23.570> foot<00:00:24.570> that's

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
do without dimensional now foot that's

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.990 
do without dimensional now foot that's
two<00:00:25.680> two<00:00:26.099> ways<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.400> doing<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.760> we're<00:00:26.910> gonna

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
two two ways of doing it we're gonna

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.880 
two two ways of doing it we're gonna
start<00:00:27.300> with<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.539> first<00:00:27.689> way<00:00:28.019> where<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.680> right

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
start with the first way where the right

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.650 
start with the first way where the right
hand<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.250> much<00:00:29.429> faster<00:00:29.730> than<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.179> left<00:00:30.390> hand

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
hand is much faster than the left hand

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.200 
hand is much faster than the left hand
let's<00:00:31.439> say<00:00:31.650> our<00:00:31.830> right<00:00:32.160> hand<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.460> play<00:00:32.669> quarter

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
let's say our right hand to play quarter

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.709 
let's say our right hand to play quarter

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
you're gonna have a D I guess it's gonna

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
sound funny

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:58.310 
sound funny

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
now you'll see right right and you

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.100 
now you'll see right right and you
notice<00:02:58.770> that<00:02:58.800> now<00:02:59.360> since<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.540> right<00:03:00.750> hand<00:03:01.020> is

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
notice that now since the right hand is

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.190 
notice that now since the right hand is
much<00:03:01.320> faster<00:03:02.090> with<00:03:03.090> quarter<00:03:03.420> notes<00:03:03.600> it<00:03:03.840> starts

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
much faster with quarter notes it starts

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.630 
much faster with quarter notes it starts
to<00:03:04.320> come<00:03:04.530> down<00:03:04.560> while<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.100> left<00:03:05.340> hand<00:03:05.459> is

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
to come down while the left hand is

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.820 
to come down while the left hand is
still<00:03:05.880> going<00:03:06.120> up<00:03:06.420> so<00:03:07.410> you're<00:03:07.530> gonna<00:03:07.620> have<00:03:07.800> a

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
still going up so you're gonna have a

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.960 
still going up so you're gonna have a
mixture<00:03:08.190> of<00:03:08.660> parallel<00:03:09.660> motion<00:03:10.080> and<00:03:10.970> contrary

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
mixture of parallel motion and contrary

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.940 
mixture of parallel motion and contrary
motion<00:03:12.260> you<00:03:13.260> know<00:03:13.350> apparently<00:03:13.560> that<00:03:13.800> both

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
motion you know apparently that both

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.199 
motion you know apparently that both
hands<00:03:14.190> are<00:03:14.280> going<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:14.790> right<00:03:14.970> and<00:03:15.150> I'll

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
hands are going to the right and I'll

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.570 
hands are going to the right and I'll
both<00:03:15.360> going<00:03:15.660> down<00:03:15.799> but<00:03:16.799> since<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.280> right<00:03:17.430> it's

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
both going down but since the right it's
