all<00:00:27.779> know<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.170> lot<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.320> those<00:00:28.500> calls<00:00:28.740> are

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
all know that a lot of those calls are

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.830 
all know that a lot of those calls are
digitized<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.179> they<00:00:30.390> stored<00:00:30.660> on<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.779> hard

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
digitized and they stored on a hard

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.889 
digitized and they stored on a hard
drive<00:00:31.170> somewhere<00:00:31.500> but<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.520> data<00:00:32.940> just<00:00:33.690> sits

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
drive somewhere but that data just sits

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.660 
drive somewhere but that data just sits
there<00:00:33.989> almost<00:00:34.260> isolated<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.460> think<00:00:35.610> you

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
there almost isolated and I think you

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.250 
there almost isolated and I think you
made<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.820> observation<00:00:35.940> no<00:00:36.360> one<00:00:36.480> looks<00:00:37.170> at

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
made the observation no one looks at

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.410 
made the observation no one looks at
that<00:00:37.410> analysis<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.129> lawsuit<00:00:38.579> usually<00:00:39.239> right

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
that analysis a lawsuit usually right

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.090 
that analysis a lawsuit usually right
but<00:00:39.930> it's<00:00:40.050> got<00:00:40.230> great<00:00:40.620> rich<00:00:40.860> information

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
but it's got great rich information

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.069 
but it's got great rich information
about<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.790> know<00:00:41.910> customer<00:00:42.450> satisfaction<00:00:42.840> you

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
about you know customer satisfaction you

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.779 
about you know customer satisfaction you
can<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.649> can<00:00:43.829> listen<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.100> micro<00:00:44.460> or<00:00:44.520> stress

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
can you can listen to micro or stress

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.220 
can you can listen to micro or stress
patterns<00:00:45.120> in<00:00:45.210> people's<00:00:45.480> voice<00:00:45.660> if<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.110> know

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
patterns in people's voice if you know

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.660 
patterns in people's voice if you know
how<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.379> analyze<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.920> right<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.550> could

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
how to analyze it right you could

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.209 
how to analyze it right you could
obviously<00:00:47.850> do<00:00:48.059> speech<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.719> text<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.230> find<00:00:50.100> out

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
obviously do speech to text and find out

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.380 
obviously do speech to text and find out
what<00:00:50.340> people<00:00:50.579> are<00:00:50.640> actually<00:00:50.760> saying<00:00:51.090> about

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
what people are actually saying about

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.330 
what people are actually saying about
your<00:00:51.539> company<00:00:51.800> whole<00:00:52.800> bunch<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.100> rich

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
your company whole bunch of rich

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.459 
your company whole bunch of rich
information<00:00:53.370> that's<00:00:54.030> there<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:55.020> usually

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
information that's there that is usually

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.290 
information that's there that is usually
not<00:00:55.590> processed<00:00:56.039> because<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.309> human<00:00:56.879> would<00:00:57.180> have

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
not processed because a human would have

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.670 
not processed because a human would have
to<00:00:57.420> listen<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.079> understand<00:00:58.559> it

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
to listen to it to understand it

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.520 
to listen to it to understand it
typically<00:00:59.129> so<00:01:00.000> that's<00:01:00.180> expensive<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:01.320> it's

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
typically so that's expensive and it's

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.930 
typically so that's expensive and it's
isolated<00:01:02.280> from<00:01:02.340> everything<00:01:02.609> else<00:01:02.820> the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
isolated from everything else the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.910 
isolated from everything else the
company<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.449> doing<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.500> that's<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.739> great

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
company is doing and so that's a great

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.620 
company is doing and so that's a great
example<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.460> disconnected<00:01:06.030> data<00:01:06.180> but<00:01:06.360> we<00:01:06.390> see

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
example of disconnected data but we see

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.960 
example of disconnected data but we see
it<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:07.020> know<00:01:07.140> with<00:01:07.290> call<00:01:07.560> detail<00:01:07.979> records<00:01:08.640> for

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
it you know with call detail records for

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.310 
it you know with call detail records for

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
data to my mind is is dead data it

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.060 
data to my mind is is dead data it
really<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.810> big<00:01:40.049> problem<00:01:40.290> for<00:01:40.530> business<00:01:40.920> and

we've got to do a better job of plugging
it<00:01:42.479> together<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.290> our<00:01:44.040> companies<00:01:44.490> actually

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670

the<00:01:51.329> silos<00:01:51.630> my<00:01:52.500> view<00:01:52.860> would<00:01:52.979> be<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.670> think

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
the silos my view would be that I think

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.330 
the silos my view would be that I think
most<00:01:54.299> people<00:01:54.630> are<00:01:55.100> consciously<00:01:56.100> incompetent

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
most people are consciously incompetent

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.520 
most people are consciously incompetent
would<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:56.969> would<00:01:57.180> be<00:01:57.240> how<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.479> describe<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.079> most

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
would it would be how I describe it most

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.200 
would it would be how I describe it most
organizations<00:01:58.740> know<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.850> they've<00:01:59.969> got<00:02:00.060> the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.999 
organizations know that they've got the
information<00:02:00.390> somewhere<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.590> think<00:02:01.799> if<00:02:01.920> you

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
information somewhere and I think if you

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.069 
information somewhere and I think if you
asked<00:02:02.340> any<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.670> rank-and-file<00:02:03.240> people

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.510 
asked any of the rank-and-file people
inside<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.439> company<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.130> we<00:02:05.219> really

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
inside a company that we really

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.920 
inside a company that we really
frustrated<00:02:06.060> they're<00:02:06.119> like<00:02:06.270> Charlie<00:02:06.659> we<00:02:06.780> know

is just being made up so how does the
company<00:02:58.950> eliminate<00:02:59.850> that<00:02:59.970> then<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.209> mean<00:03:00.360> how

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
company eliminate that then I mean how

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.570 
company eliminate that then I mean how
do<00:03:00.510> how<00:03:00.660> do<00:03:00.720> you<00:03:00.840> get<00:03:00.959> past<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.830> hippo<00:03:02.190> and

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
do how do you get past the the hippo and

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.240 
do how do you get past the the hippo and
and<00:03:03.090> get<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.780> actually<00:03:04.260> connecting<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.100> data

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
and get to actually connecting the data

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.580 
and get to actually connecting the data
yeah<00:03:05.670> so<00:03:05.880> it's<00:03:06.120> it<00:03:06.330> is<00:03:06.720> a<00:03:06.750> challenge<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:07.440> so

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
yeah so it's it is a challenge and so

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.960 
yeah so it's it is a challenge and so
there's<00:03:08.160> a<00:03:08.220> couple<00:03:08.340> of<00:03:08.430> things<00:03:08.519> we<00:03:08.730> think<00:03:08.850> are

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
there's a couple of things we think are

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.370 
there's a couple of things we think are
critical<00:03:09.090> so<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.600> first<00:03:09.810> is<00:03:09.989> you've<00:03:10.230> got<00:03:10.319> to

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
critical so the first is you've got to

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
critical so the first is you've got to
be<00:03:10.440> able<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.650> look<00:03:10.709> at<00:03:10.830> all<00:03:10.980> types<00:03:11.250> of

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
be able to look at all types of

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.150 
be able to look at all types of
information<00:03:12.709> structured<00:03:13.709> unstructured

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
information structured unstructured

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.699 
information structured unstructured
machine<00:03:14.610> we<00:03:14.760> talked<00:03:15.000> about<00:03:15.150> texts<00:03:16.080> video

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
machine we talked about texts video

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.080 
machine we talked about texts video
speech<00:03:17.549> so<00:03:18.540> audio<00:03:18.870> still<00:03:19.560> images<00:03:20.010> being<00:03:20.850> able

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
speech so audio still images being able

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.370 
speech so audio still images being able
to<00:03:21.180> look<00:03:21.299> at<00:03:21.420> all<00:03:21.660> types<00:03:21.989> of<00:03:22.170> information

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
to look at all types of information

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.599 
to look at all types of information
you've<00:03:22.829> gotta<00:03:22.950> be<00:03:23.010> able<00:03:23.040> to<00:03:23.160> obviously<00:03:23.250> do<00:03:23.519> it

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
you've gotta be able to obviously do it

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:24.800 
you've gotta be able to obviously do it
at<00:03:23.700> scale<00:03:23.940> because<00:03:24.239> a<00:03:24.329> lot<00:03:24.510> of<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.630> time

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
at scale because a lot of the time

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:25.789 
at scale because a lot of the time
you're<00:03:24.930> talking<00:03:25.140> about<00:03:25.260> a<00:03:25.320> lot<00:03:25.590> of

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
you're talking about a lot of

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.250 
you're talking about a lot of
information<00:03:26.489> speed<00:03:27.150> is<00:03:27.299> really<00:03:27.510> important<00:03:27.989> we

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
information speed is really important we

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.569 
information speed is really important we
work<00:03:28.440> with<00:03:28.560> one<00:03:28.739> client<00:03:29.010> who<00:03:29.250> literally

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
work with one client who literally

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.000 
work with one client who literally
analyzes<00:03:30.329> click<00:03:30.540> streams<00:03:30.840> from<00:03:31.590> their<00:03:31.829> apps

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
analyzes click streams from their apps

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.039 
analyzes click streams from their apps
on<00:03:32.280> their<00:03:32.370> phones<00:03:32.640> and<00:03:32.970> uses<00:03:33.600> that<00:03:33.690> to<00:03:33.840> figure

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
on their phones and uses that to figure

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.090 
on their phones and uses that to figure
out<00:03:34.170> whether<00:03:34.290> their<00:03:34.530> customers<00:03:34.950> are<00:03:35.040> getting

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
out whether their customers are getting

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.340 
out whether their customers are getting
bored<00:03:35.459> of<00:03:35.579> their<00:03:35.700> app<00:03:35.820> and<00:03:36.030> then<00:03:36.450> talks<00:03:37.079> of<00:03:37.260> the

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
bored of their app and then talks of the

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.259 
bored of their app and then talks of the
developers<00:03:37.709> to<00:03:37.799> upgrade<00:03:38.130> to<00:03:38.160> speed<00:03:38.549> of<00:03:38.760> and

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
developers to upgrade to speed of and

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:40.460 
developers to upgrade to speed of and
we're<00:03:39.359> talking<00:03:39.600> with<00:03:39.810> in<00:03:39.930> a<00:03:39.989> business<00:03:40.320> day

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
we're talking with in a business day

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.960 
we're talking with in a business day
they'll<00:03:40.680> make<00:03:40.709> that<00:03:40.980> whole<00:03:41.130> process<00:03:41.310> work<00:03:41.700> so

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
they'll make that whole process work so

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.599 
they'll make that whole process work so
speeds<00:03:42.600> really<00:03:42.989> important<00:03:43.530> but<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.489> ability

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
speeds really important but the ability

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.610 
speeds really important but the ability
to<00:03:44.910> connect<00:03:45.359> to<00:03:45.630> sources<00:03:45.989> of<00:03:46.049> information<00:03:46.290> is

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
to connect to sources of information is

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.490 
to connect to sources of information is
critical<00:03:46.739> so<00:03:47.220> with<00:03:47.519> a<00:03:47.600> brief<00:03:48.600> plug<00:03:48.900> for<00:03:49.109> Haven

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
critical so with a brief plug for Haven

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.140 
critical so with a brief plug for Haven
we've<00:03:49.950> got<00:03:50.100> about<00:03:50.190> seven<00:03:50.640> hundred<00:03:50.670> different

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
we've got about seven hundred different

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.720 
we've got about seven hundred different
connectors<00:03:51.810> that<00:03:52.049> Haven<00:03:53.040> can<00:03:53.250> talk<00:03:53.430> to<00:03:53.609> the

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
connectors that Haven can talk to the

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.430 
connectors that Haven can talk to the
source<00:03:53.970> information<00:03:54.299> including<00:03:54.870> WordPerfect

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
source information including WordPerfect

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.110 
source information including WordPerfect
remember<00:03:55.680> WordPerfect<00:03:56.220> that's<00:03:56.850> still<00:03:57.030> around

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
remember WordPerfect that's still around

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.020 
remember WordPerfect that's still around
not<00:03:58.019> really<00:03:58.440> but<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:59.069> documents<00:03:59.640> are<00:03:59.790> and

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
not really but the documents are and

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.430 
not really but the documents are and
again<00:04:00.480> if<00:04:00.600> you<00:04:00.660> can't<00:04:00.870> talk<00:04:01.079> to<00:04:01.230> them<00:04:01.319> they

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
again if you can't talk to them they

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.530 
again if you can't talk to them they
become<00:04:01.500> disconnected<00:04:02.130> pieces<00:04:02.489> of<00:04:02.790> data<00:04:02.910> so

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
become disconnected pieces of data so

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.309 
become disconnected pieces of data so
we've<00:04:03.660> got<00:04:03.750> seven<00:04:03.959> hundred<00:04:04.230> different

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
we've got seven hundred different

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:05.990 
we've got seven hundred different
connectors<00:04:04.859> that<00:04:04.890> we<00:04:05.430> can<00:04:05.579> then<00:04:05.730> use<00:04:05.970> to

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
connectors that we can then use to

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.690 
connectors that we can then use to
extract<00:04:06.299> that<00:04:06.930> information<00:04:06.989> and<00:04:07.680> bring<00:04:08.609> it

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
extract that information and bring it

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.809 
extract that information and bring it
into<00:04:08.819> one<00:04:09.000> place<00:04:09.150> and<00:04:09.359> then<00:04:09.480> related<00:04:10.609> to<00:04:11.609> other

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
into one place and then related to other

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.550 
into one place and then related to other
pieces<00:04:12.150> of<00:04:12.359> information<00:04:12.569> that's<00:04:13.410> the

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
pieces of information that's the

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.960 
pieces of information that's the
critical<00:04:13.709> part<00:04:14.100> being<00:04:14.310> able<00:04:14.489> to<00:04:14.549> connect<00:04:14.850> be

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
critical part being able to connect be

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.520 
critical part being able to connect be
able<00:04:15.120> to<00:04:15.209> do<00:04:15.269> it<00:04:15.359> at<00:04:15.480> scale<00:04:15.720> and<00:04:15.989> be<00:04:16.200> able<00:04:16.289> to<00:04:16.440> do

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
able to do it at scale and be able to do

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.099 
able to do it at scale and be able to do
it<00:04:16.560> with<00:04:16.680> all<00:04:16.950> types<00:04:17.220> of<00:04:17.370> information

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
it with all types of information

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.249 
it with all types of information
so<00:04:19.069> how<00:04:19.639> do<00:04:19.699> you<00:04:19.849> get<00:04:19.969> companies<00:04:20.359> to<00:04:20.389> see<00:04:20.719> that

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:21.259 
so how do you get companies to see that

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:23.469 
so how do you get companies to see that
there<00:04:21.620> is<00:04:21.829> a<00:04:22.219> return<00:04:23.090> on<00:04:23.270> this<00:04:23.360> because

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
there is a return on this because

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.379 
there is a return on this because
obviously<00:04:23.659> they<00:04:24.530> people<00:04:25.310> get<00:04:25.969> the<00:04:26.090> idea<00:04:26.120> that

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
obviously they people get the idea that

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.629 
obviously they people get the idea that
they're<00:04:26.689> getting<00:04:26.810> reports<00:04:27.289> now<00:04:27.500> so<00:04:27.919> so<00:04:28.460> how<00:04:28.580> do

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
they're getting reports now so so how do

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:29.740 
they're getting reports now so so how do
you<00:04:28.729> get<00:04:28.819> them<00:04:28.969> to<00:04:29.000> get<00:04:29.389> the<00:04:29.509> sense<00:04:29.629> that

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
you get them to get the sense that

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.570 
you get them to get the sense that
there's<00:04:30.020> going<00:04:30.530> to<00:04:30.650> be<00:04:30.680> a<00:04:30.770> return<00:04:30.949> on

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
there's going to be a return on

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.339 
there's going to be a return on
connecting<00:04:32.330> this<00:04:32.479> data<00:04:32.750> together<00:04:32.930> if<00:04:33.229> they

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:33.349 
connecting this data together if they

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:35.920 
connecting this data together if they
already<00:04:33.710> were<00:04:34.039> able<00:04:34.400> to<00:04:34.580> kind<00:04:35.449> of<00:04:35.539> cobble

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
already were able to kind of cobble

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.110 
already were able to kind of cobble
together<00:04:36.050> a<00:04:36.289> report<00:04:36.560> before<00:04:36.889> it's<00:04:37.639> I<00:04:37.969> think

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
together a report before it's I think

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.670 
together a report before it's I think
this<00:04:38.300> is<00:04:38.479> really<00:04:38.659> the<00:04:38.870> critical<00:04:39.020> problem<00:04:39.560> that

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
this is really the critical problem that

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.770 
this is really the critical problem that
we're<00:04:39.800> dealing<00:04:39.919> with<00:04:40.099> because<00:04:40.250> hippos<00:04:40.780> you

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
we're dealing with because hippos you

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:42.879 
we're dealing with because hippos you
know<00:04:41.930> will<00:04:42.139> continue<00:04:42.469> exist<00:04:42.800> the

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
know will continue exist the

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:44.709 
know will continue exist the
highest-paid<00:04:43.280> person's<00:04:43.669> opinion<00:04:43.879> on<00:04:44.150> will<00:04:44.539> is

00:04:44.709 --> 00:04:44.719 
highest-paid person's opinion on will is

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:47.140 
highest-paid person's opinion on will is
a<00:04:44.750> cultural<00:04:45.319> problem<00:04:45.610> so<00:04:46.610> I<00:04:46.639> think<00:04:46.819> the<00:04:47.000> first

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
a cultural problem so I think the first

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.790 
a cultural problem so I think the first
thing<00:04:47.300> we<00:04:47.479> need<00:04:47.599> to<00:04:47.659> be<00:04:47.840> doing<00:04:47.870> is<00:04:48.199> building<00:04:48.560> a

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
thing we need to be doing is building a

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.129 
thing we need to be doing is building a
culture<00:04:49.039> of<00:04:49.280> you<00:04:50.030> know<00:04:50.120> do<00:04:50.240> I<00:04:50.330> have<00:04:50.360> real<00:04:50.870> data

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
culture of you know do I have real data

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:52.420 
culture of you know do I have real data
I<00:04:51.349> always<00:04:51.500> say<00:04:51.620> to<00:04:51.740> people<00:04:51.830> when<00:04:52.069> they<00:04:52.219> say<00:04:52.400> I

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
I always say to people when they say I

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.429 
I always say to people when they say I
think<00:04:52.909> o<00:04:53.090> SI<00:04:53.509> think<00:04:53.750> or<00:04:53.870> know<00:04:54.080> there's<00:04:54.379> a

00:04:54.429 --> 00:04:54.439 
think o SI think or know there's a

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:55.659 
think o SI think or know there's a
really<00:04:54.590> big<00:04:54.800> difference<00:04:54.919> and<00:04:55.250> if<00:04:55.310> the<00:04:55.400> answers

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
really big difference and if the answers

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:58.179 
really big difference and if the answers
not<00:04:56.120> we<00:04:56.539> know<00:04:56.750> then<00:04:57.529> you<00:04:57.650> really<00:04:57.860> need<00:04:57.889> to<00:04:58.099> be

00:04:58.179 --> 00:04:58.189 
not we know then you really need to be

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:59.950 
not we know then you really need to be
looking<00:04:58.400> at<00:04:58.550> what<00:04:59.150> is<00:04:59.180> the<00:04:59.389> impact<00:04:59.750> of

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
looking at what is the impact of

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.050 
looking at what is the impact of
guessing<00:05:00.919> because<00:05:01.340> I<00:05:01.550> think<00:05:01.610> that's<00:05:01.849> a<00:05:01.909> real

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
guessing because I think that's a real

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.519 
guessing because I think that's a real
problem<00:05:02.240> the<00:05:03.139> second<00:05:03.500> thing<00:05:03.620> is<00:05:04.840> the<00:05:05.840> value<00:05:06.409> of

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:06.529 
problem the second thing is the value of

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:07.959 
problem the second thing is the value of
experimentation<00:05:07.189> we're<00:05:07.520> increasingly

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:07.969 
experimentation we're increasingly

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:09.909 
experimentation we're increasingly
seeing<00:05:08.300> now<00:05:08.599> that<00:05:09.080> a<00:05:09.229> lot<00:05:09.379> of<00:05:09.409> people<00:05:09.529> should

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
seeing now that a lot of people should

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.129 
seeing now that a lot of people should
be<00:05:09.979> running<00:05:10.360> multivariant<00:05:11.360> tests<00:05:11.719> so<00:05:11.900> I

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
be running multivariant tests so I

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:13.629 
be running multivariant tests so I
worked<00:05:12.500> with<00:05:12.620> an<00:05:12.740> airline<00:05:13.039> company<00:05:13.460> recently

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 
worked with an airline company recently

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:15.879 
worked with an airline company recently
their<00:05:14.419> entire<00:05:14.750> webpage<00:05:15.050> how<00:05:15.469> they<00:05:15.590> sell<00:05:15.770> to

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
their entire webpage how they sell to

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:17.050 
their entire webpage how they sell to
their<00:05:16.009> customers<00:05:16.159> built<00:05:16.639> on<00:05:16.789> data

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
their customers built on data

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.339 
their customers built on data
experiments<00:05:17.870> so<00:05:18.050> they're<00:05:18.169> constantly

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:18.349 
experiments so they're constantly

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:20.769 
experiments so they're constantly
experimenting<00:05:18.979> with<00:05:19.279> a<00:05:19.520> be<00:05:19.759> testing<00:05:20.240> to<00:05:20.599> try

00:05:20.769 --> 00:05:20.779 
experimenting with a be testing to try

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:22.029 
experimenting with a be testing to try
and<00:05:20.870> work<00:05:20.990> out<00:05:21.110> what<00:05:21.169> works<00:05:21.500> better<00:05:21.710> or<00:05:21.889> not

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 
and work out what works better or not

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:24.040 
and work out what works better or not
and<00:05:22.190> again<00:05:22.250> that<00:05:22.789> can<00:05:22.940> only<00:05:23.029> happen<00:05:23.300> if<00:05:23.750> you

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
and again that can only happen if you

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.990 
and again that can only happen if you
have<00:05:24.289> that<00:05:24.919> kind<00:05:25.190> of<00:05:25.250> connected<00:05:25.580> intelligence

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
have that kind of connected intelligence

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.670 
have that kind of connected intelligence
basis<00:05:26.270> now<00:05:26.389> what's<00:05:26.930> the<00:05:27.080> cost<00:05:27.319> justification

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
basis now what's the cost justification

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.170 
basis now what's the cost justification
for<00:05:28.250> that<00:05:28.279> or<00:05:28.520> the<00:05:28.639> business<00:05:28.940> justification

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
for that or the business justification

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.360 
for that or the business justification
that's<00:05:30.080> going<00:05:30.289> to<00:05:30.379> vary<00:05:30.409> I<00:05:30.770> think<00:05:31.039> that's<00:05:31.190> the

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
that's going to vary I think that's the

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.420 
that's going to vary I think that's the
hard<00:05:31.580> part<00:05:31.699> is<00:05:32.060> is<00:05:32.240> we're<00:05:33.080> going<00:05:33.229> to<00:05:33.349> I<00:05:33.889> think

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
hard part is is we're going to I think

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.649 
hard part is is we're going to I think
we're<00:05:34.610> going<00:05:34.699> to<00:05:34.789> struggle<00:05:35.060> to<00:05:35.240> a<00:05:35.330> certain

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:35.659 
we're going to struggle to a certain

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:40.059 
we're going to struggle to a certain
degree<00:05:36.400> to<00:05:37.400> justify<00:05:38.089> that<00:05:38.800> without<00:05:39.800> just

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:40.069 
degree to justify that without just

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:42.339 
degree to justify that without just
maybe<00:05:40.219> taking<00:05:40.699> a<00:05:40.759> bit<00:05:41.089> of<00:05:41.120> a<00:05:41.240> we<00:05:42.020> all<00:05:42.169> know

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:42.349 
maybe taking a bit of a we all know

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:44.019 
maybe taking a bit of a we all know
better<00:05:43.039> data<00:05:43.279> is<00:05:43.430> going<00:05:43.520> to<00:05:43.639> lead<00:05:43.789> to<00:05:43.819> better

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:44.029 
better data is going to lead to better

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:45.730 
better data is going to lead to better
decisions<00:05:44.509> it's<00:05:44.900> so<00:05:45.110> it<00:05:45.229> really<00:05:45.379> is<00:05:45.469> going<00:05:45.650> to

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
decisions it's so it really is going to

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:46.929 
decisions it's so it really is going to
be<00:05:45.800> a<00:05:45.830> leap<00:05:46.009> of<00:05:46.129> faith<00:05:46.339> for<00:05:46.370> a<00:05:46.580> lot<00:05:46.699> of<00:05:46.819> people

00:05:46.929 --> 00:05:46.939 
be a leap of faith for a lot of people

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:48.670 
be a leap of faith for a lot of people
and<00:05:47.539> we're<00:05:47.689> seeing<00:05:47.870> that<00:05:47.990> already<00:05:48.349> a<00:05:48.409> lot<00:05:48.589> of

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
and we're seeing that already a lot of

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.499 
and we're seeing that already a lot of
these<00:05:48.770> early<00:05:49.069> adopters<00:05:49.460> of<00:05:49.490> data<00:05:49.759> science<00:05:50.270> and

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:50.509 
these early adopters of data science and

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:52.570 
these early adopters of data science and
big<00:05:50.659> data<00:05:50.810> are<00:05:51.409> showing<00:05:51.830> the<00:05:51.919> returns<00:05:52.279> and<00:05:52.520> the

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
big data are showing the returns and the

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.850 
big data are showing the returns and the
results<00:05:52.939> of<00:05:53.060> just<00:05:53.509> you<00:05:53.870> know<00:05:53.900> I<00:05:54.259> guess

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
results of just you know I guess

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:55.959 
results of just you know I guess
following<00:05:55.279> their<00:05:55.400> instincts<00:05:55.759> which<00:05:55.849> is

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:55.969 
following their instincts which is

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:57.219 
following their instincts which is
better<00:05:56.120> to<00:05:56.210> sit<00:05:56.449> better<00:05:56.629> data<00:05:56.870> leads<00:05:57.139> to

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:57.229 
better to sit better data leads to

00:05:57.229 --> 00:05:59.290 
better to sit better data leads to
better<00:05:57.349> decisions<00:05:57.830> all<00:05:58.639> right<00:05:58.789> well<00:05:58.969> I<00:05:59.000> hope

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
better decisions all right well I hope

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.399 
better decisions all right well I hope
more<00:05:59.509> companies<00:05:59.779> take<00:05:59.900> a<00:05:59.930> leap<00:06:00.110> of<00:06:00.229> faith

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:00.409 
more companies take a leap of faith

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:02.019
