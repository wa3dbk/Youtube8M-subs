00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.990

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:25.260

 cut into slices and salt 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.840
 The first thing we are going to do is put 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.879
 one liter of water more or less on fire 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.309
 strong in a pot in my case under pressure 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:54.460
 and let's wait for it to be hot already 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.120
 it's hot and we're going to throw all the 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.290
 vegetable 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.600
 green beans 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:05.720
 the faces and the peas 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.100
 a pinch of salt 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.100
 we put the box 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.490
 we will put the valve and wait for 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.350
 it starts to spin as we see that it has 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.100
 started to turn and we will wait two 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.890
 minutes after two minutes turn aside 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.530
 the pot and wait for the 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.030
 steam we have opened the lid and the 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.300
 vegetables have not been totally 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.890
 Tender ones have been left al dente so 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.740
 stay if you do not in a pot 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.810
 traditional and now let's move on to 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.330

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.520

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.940
 where we are going to put the 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.369
 eggs we will put a tomato bottom in 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.430
 my case I 'm going to use casseroles 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.430
 mud 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.220
 and now we will add the vegetables 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.950
 we've already put the vegetables the three 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.930
 pots and we have put the oven to 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.460
 preheat with heat above and by 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.570
 down to 200 degrees 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:24.350
 now we will put slices of ham 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:27.620
 around in the three containers 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.450
 in the middle, then the egg will not go 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.350
 we have put the ham now we will put 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.350
 Slices of chorizo 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:43.230
 once put chorizo we will make a hole 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.239
 in the center we will put the egg and so 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.750
 we will do with the following and now you 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:52.250
 we will put a little salt to each egg and 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.250
 finally the pepper strips 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.080
 we have already put the pepper and now 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.730

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:12.590
