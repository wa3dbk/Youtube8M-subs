 ingredients then stop taking place 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:05.020
 just put the lid on and you can 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.280
 place him in this way and 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.960
 if you put it this way with the white 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.060
 you have placed it at the bottom 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.890
 use the steam function 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.800

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.710
 keep pressed aside or missing 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.750
 otherwise he just shoots back 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.490
 and also stop blending our way 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.860
