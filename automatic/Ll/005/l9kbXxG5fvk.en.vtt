00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
Before Time this was really

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.750 
Before Time this was really
underwhelming<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.590> know<00:00:52.949> it's<00:00:53.190> weird<00:00:53.340> saying

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
underwhelming I know it's weird saying

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.000 
underwhelming I know it's weird saying
that<00:00:54.000> even<00:00:54.329> as<00:00:54.449> I'm<00:00:54.629> an<00:00:54.780> adult<00:00:55.170> talking<00:00:55.530> about

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
that even as I'm an adult talking about

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.250 
that even as I'm an adult talking about
this<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.520> reviewing<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.059> again<00:00:57.360> but<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
this and reviewing it again but the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.349 
this and reviewing it again but the
reason<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.680> bring<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:58.920> up<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.309> because<00:00:59.370> the<00:01:00.120> land

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
reason I bring it up is because the land

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.599 
reason I bring it up is because the land
before<00:01:00.570> time<00:01:00.780> was<00:01:01.410> much<00:01:01.620> more<00:01:01.859> like<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.100> Disney

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
before time was much more like a Disney

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.240 
before time was much more like a Disney
film<00:01:02.789> than<00:01:03.059> Oliver<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.780> company<00:01:03.899> was<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:05.070> did

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
film than Oliver and company was it did

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.859 
film than Oliver and company was it did
a<00:01:05.280> much<00:01:05.549> better<00:01:05.580> job<00:01:05.909> teaching<00:01:06.600> life<00:01:06.840> lessons

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
a much better job teaching life lessons

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.950

with<00:01:07.680> really<00:01:08.159> heavy<00:01:08.430> scenes<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.330> well<00:01:09.570> really

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
with really heavy scenes and well really

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.070

gets a funny line every once in a while

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.750 
gets a funny line every once in a while
it's<00:03:40.410> funny<00:03:40.650> thinking<00:03:41.040> he'd<00:03:41.160> come<00:03:41.370> back<00:03:41.549> as<00:03:41.730> a

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
it's funny thinking he'd come back as a

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.180 
it's funny thinking he'd come back as a
hyena<00:03:42.120> a<00:03:42.269> few<00:03:42.510> years<00:03:42.690> later<00:03:42.930> actually<00:03:43.739> I

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
hyena a few years later actually I

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.920 
hyena a few years later actually I
really<00:03:44.670> do<00:03:44.790> like<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.120> way<00:03:45.150> they<00:03:45.360> portray<00:03:45.720> New

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
really do like the way they portray New

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.050 
really do like the way they portray New
York<00:03:46.170> after<00:03:46.680> finally<00:03:47.310> having<00:03:47.519> been<00:03:47.819> there<00:03:48.000> I

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
York after finally having been there I

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.759 
York after finally having been there I
gotta<00:03:48.330> say<00:03:48.600> it's<00:03:48.840> pretty<00:03:48.900> close<00:03:49.380> to<00:03:49.620> accurate

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
gotta say it's pretty close to accurate

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.789 
gotta say it's pretty close to accurate
it's<00:03:50.519> big<00:03:50.850> but<00:03:51.209> it's<00:03:51.420> tight<00:03:51.870> there's<00:03:52.470> a<00:03:52.530> lot<00:03:52.680> of

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
it's big but it's tight there's a lot of

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.440 
it's big but it's tight there's a lot of
attitude<00:03:53.280> but<00:03:53.519> there's<00:03:53.730> a<00:03:53.790> lot<00:03:53.940> of<00:03:54.060> character

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
attitude but there's a lot of character

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.240 
attitude but there's a lot of character
-<00:03:54.660> from<00:03:55.170> an<00:03:55.290> animation<00:03:55.650> point<00:03:56.010> of<00:03:56.100> view<00:03:56.220> I

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
- from an animation point of view I

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.670 
- from an animation point of view I
think<00:03:56.579> they<00:03:56.700> get<00:03:56.820> it<00:03:56.880> down<00:03:57.090> spot-on<00:03:57.680> aside

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
think they get it down spot-on aside

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.710 
think they get it down spot-on aside
from<00:03:58.829> that<00:03:58.890> it's<00:03:59.430> surprisingly<00:04:00.120> forgettable

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
from that it's surprisingly forgettable

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.780 
from that it's surprisingly forgettable
I<00:04:01.079> don't<00:04:01.380> remember<00:04:01.620> too<00:04:02.040> many<00:04:02.370> of<00:04:02.670> the

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
I don't remember too many of the

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.640 
I don't remember too many of the
characters<00:04:03.450> I'm<00:04:03.750> like<00:04:03.870> I<00:04:03.989> said<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.350> songs

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
characters I'm like I said the songs

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:05.930 
characters I'm like I said the songs

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.069 
except for the wine and yeah for Disney
to<00:04:08.160> do<00:04:08.280> a<00:04:08.310> version<00:04:08.640> of<00:04:08.880> Oliver<00:04:09.420> I<00:04:09.600> sort<00:04:10.049> of

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
to do a version of Oliver I sort of

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.289 
to do a version of Oliver I sort of
expected<00:04:10.620> a<00:04:10.739> lot<00:04:10.859> more<00:04:10.920> than<00:04:11.340> this<00:04:11.519> at<00:04:12.090> least

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
expected a lot more than this at least

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.449 
expected a lot more than this at least
for<00:04:12.450> it<00:04:12.540> to<00:04:12.600> make<00:04:12.750> a<00:04:12.780> bigger<00:04:13.049> impact<00:04:13.160> but<00:04:14.160> again

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
for it to make a bigger impact but again

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.490 
for it to make a bigger impact but again
it's<00:04:14.820> not<00:04:14.910> awful<00:04:15.600> it's<00:04:15.989> just<00:04:16.200> strange

it's not awful it's just strange

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.500 
it's not awful it's just strange
