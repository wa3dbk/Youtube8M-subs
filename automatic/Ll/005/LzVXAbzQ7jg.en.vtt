 in the button end the victory so-called grand opera it is all about 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.180
 where are the boundaries of all the sins of the musicians of the 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.180
 performers 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.140
 we are aware of Heidenheim 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.910
 First of all, it will be quite useful 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.950
 not always ahead of reality 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.730
 that is very crucial for the performer for what we do with the 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.420
 Make actors 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.430

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.560
 by his character to not yet represent something or showed I am one 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.000

 So the music of Monteverdi this 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.520
 Lecturers times to see the big word and you can die with us almost everything

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:12.619
 that they are giving a flood instrumentation sounds like that 

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:15.969
 what we visited is very close to the destination 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.169
