called<00:00:41.100> covalence<00:00:41.820> dust<00:00:42.180> or<00:00:42.480> coal<00:00:42.800> there<00:00:43.800> it

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
called covalence dust or coal there it

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.810 
called covalence dust or coal there it
is<00:00:44.040> covalence<00:00:44.640> dust<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.379> let's<00:00:47.039> see<00:00:47.250> this

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
is covalence dust and so let's see this

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.310 
is covalence dust and so let's see this
one<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.120> built<00:00:48.300> with<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> whole<00:00:48.809> bunch<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.050> stone

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
one is built with a whole bunch of stone

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.479 
one is built with a whole bunch of stone
and<00:00:49.680> Chara<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.820> charcoal<00:00:51.239> okay<00:00:52.219> this<00:00:53.219> one<00:00:53.399> is

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
and Chara and charcoal okay this one is

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.549 
and Chara and charcoal okay this one is
built<00:00:53.670> with<00:00:54.000> iron<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.989> redstone<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.379> this

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
built with iron and redstone and this

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.170 
built with iron and redstone and this
one<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.800> built<00:00:55.920> with<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.160> diamond<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.730> coal

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
one is built with the diamond and coal

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.389 
one is built with the diamond and coal
so<00:00:57.930> let's<00:00:58.320> go<00:00:58.469> do<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.980> let's<00:00:59.250> see

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
so let's go do that let's see

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.229 
so let's go do that let's see
cobblestone<00:01:02.399> got<00:01:02.609> some<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.210> I

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
cobblestone got some of that and I

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.609 
cobblestone got some of that and I
believe<00:01:03.510> everything<00:01:03.719> else<00:01:03.960> will<00:01:04.080> be<00:01:04.110> upstairs

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
believe everything else will be upstairs

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.980 
believe everything else will be upstairs
and<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.790> covalence<00:01:06.210> dust<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.570> actually<00:01:06.840> used

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
and the covalence dust is actually used

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.870 
and the covalence dust is actually used
to<00:01:07.080> do<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.200> bunch<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.530> cool<00:01:07.680> stuff<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.280> take<00:01:08.580> it

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
to do a bunch of cool stuff and take it

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.730 
to do a bunch of cool stuff and take it
but<00:01:09.090> we<00:01:09.510> haven't<00:01:09.659> haven't<00:01:09.900> actually<00:01:10.110> seen<00:01:10.500> any

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.980 

steam<00:01:26.450> engines<00:01:27.380> but<00:01:27.799> I<00:01:27.830> guess<00:01:28.010> not<00:01:28.340> so<00:01:28.990> I'm

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
steam engines but I guess not so I'm

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.539 
steam engines but I guess not so I'm
piece<00:01:30.140> of<00:01:30.290> charcoal<00:01:30.650> and<00:01:30.770> that<00:01:30.830> gives<00:01:31.040> us<00:01:31.159> 40

piece of charcoal and that gives us 40

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.310 
piece of charcoal and that gives us 40
covalence<00:01:32.299> dust<00:01:32.619> level<00:01:33.619> one<00:01:34.390> then<00:01:35.390> it<00:01:35.750> was<00:01:35.900> one

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
covalence dust level one then it was one

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.920 
covalence dust level one then it was one
iron<00:01:36.619> and<00:01:37.220> I<00:01:37.729> had<00:01:38.119> some<00:01:38.299> redstone<00:01:38.479> in<00:01:38.780> here<00:01:38.900> I

give us an iron nugget hmm okay that'll
give<00:01:45.979> us<00:01:46.009> a<00:01:46.310> valence<00:01:46.670> does<00:01:46.820> little<00:01:47.090> too<00:01:47.299> and<00:01:47.600> I

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
give us a valence does little too and I

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.539 
give us a valence does little too and I
did<00:01:47.930> not<00:01:48.049> mean<00:01:48.200> to<00:01:48.320> make<00:01:48.380> that<00:01:48.649> much<00:01:48.860> but<00:01:49.369> there

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
did not mean to make that much but there

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.539 
did not mean to make that much but there
you<00:01:49.670> go<00:01:49.700> that's<00:01:50.149> what<00:01:51.110> we've<00:01:51.200> got<00:01:51.440> and<00:01:51.740> then<00:01:52.130> we

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
you go that's what we've got and then we

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.130 
you go that's what we've got and then we
can<00:01:52.790> use<00:01:53.149> a<00:01:53.600> diamonds<00:01:54.259> in<00:01:54.440> one<00:01:55.040> regular<00:01:55.700> coal

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
can use a diamonds in one regular coal

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.930 
can use a diamonds in one regular coal
to<00:01:57.140> give<00:01:57.289> us<00:01:57.380> a<00:01:57.619> valence<00:01:58.039> that's<00:01:58.250> level<00:01:58.490> three

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
to give us a valence that's level three

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.490 
to give us a valence that's level three
alright<00:01:59.780> so<00:01:59.899> we're<00:01:59.990> gonna<00:02:00.080> do<00:02:00.229> a<00:02:00.259> bunch<00:02:00.440> of

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
alright so we're gonna do a bunch of

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
cool stuff with this dust but today

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.120 
cool stuff with this dust but today
we're<00:02:02.210> we<00:02:02.420> only<00:02:02.570> got<00:02:02.720> two<00:02:02.960> two<00:02:03.409> objectives<00:02:03.920> and

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
we're we only got two two objectives and

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.540 
we're we only got two two objectives and
that<00:02:04.399> is<00:02:04.520> an<00:02:04.610> alchemical<00:02:04.909> chest<00:02:06.520> which<00:02:07.520> is

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
that is an alchemical chest which is

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.190 
that is an alchemical chest which is
right<00:02:07.850> there<00:02:08.090> which<00:02:08.360> we're<00:02:08.509> gonna<00:02:08.600> need<00:02:08.780> our

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
right there which we're gonna need our

right there which we're gonna need our
three<00:02:10.130> types<00:02:10.340> of<00:02:10.429> covalence<00:02:10.789> dust<00:02:11.060> another

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
three types of covalence dust another

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.490

want that repaired I'm not sure if it'll

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.120 
want that repaired I'm not sure if it'll
repair<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.260> wrench<00:03:07.500> but<00:03:07.680> we'll<00:03:07.769> give<00:03:07.890> it<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:07.980> go

of repair and we can actually also
convert<00:03:15.750> this<00:03:15.989> chest<00:03:16.500> into<00:03:16.950> a<00:03:17.180> energy

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
convert this chest into a energy

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.810 
convert this chest into a energy
convincing<00:03:18.959> chest<00:03:19.260> which<00:03:19.500> is<00:03:19.820> called

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
convincing chest which is called

convincing chest which is called
something<00:03:21.590> what<00:03:22.590> does<00:03:22.650> that<00:03:22.709> cause<00:03:22.950> it<00:03:23.160> just

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
something what does that cause it just

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.460 
something what does that cause it just
called<00:03:23.459> an<00:03:23.519> energy<00:03:23.700> convince<00:03:24.120> her<00:03:24.239> yeah<00:03:24.510> an

called an energy convince her yeah an

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.080 
called an energy convince her yeah an
energy<00:03:25.830> condenser<00:03:26.190> might<00:03:26.640> make<00:03:26.790> in<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.000> next

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
energy condenser might make in the next

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.000
