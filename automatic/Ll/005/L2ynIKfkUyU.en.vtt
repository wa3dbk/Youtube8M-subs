00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:56.740 
storm we're looking at very strong

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.190

conditions and sustained winds certainly

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.320 
conditions and sustained winds certainly
going<00:03:59.950> into<00:04:00.310> category<00:04:00.730> 5<00:04:00.910> intensity

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
going into category 5 intensity

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.150 
going into category 5 intensity
obviously<00:04:01.840> as<00:04:01.960> much<00:04:01.990> higher<00:04:02.410> gusts<00:04:02.740> as<00:04:02.980> well

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
obviously as much higher gusts as well

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.400 
obviously as much higher gusts as well
so<00:04:03.790> it<00:04:03.850> will<00:04:03.940> possibly<00:04:04.630> cause<00:04:04.810> far-reaching
