all um this book best place take place

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.770 
all um this book best place take place
over<00:01:50.670> like<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.850> larger<00:01:51.270> period<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.570> time<00:01:51.750> I

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
over like a larger period of time I

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.020 
over like a larger period of time I
think<00:01:52.049> um<00:01:52.229> than<00:01:53.189> any<00:01:53.369> of<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.610> other<00:01:53.729> books

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
think um than any of the other books

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.780 
think um than any of the other books
like<00:01:54.299> it's<00:01:54.509> spread<00:01:54.869> out<00:01:54.899> more<00:01:55.770> which<00:01:56.070> kind<00:01:56.670> of

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
like it's spread out more which kind of

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.639 
like it's spread out more which kind of
makes<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.450> little<00:01:57.840> more<00:01:57.990> believable<00:01:58.530> that

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
makes it a little more believable that

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.340 
makes it a little more believable that
he<00:01:58.920> would<00:01:59.070> move<00:02:00.030> on<00:02:00.240> but<00:02:00.540> still<00:02:00.810> it's<00:02:00.960> not<00:02:01.110> been

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
he would move on but still it's not been
