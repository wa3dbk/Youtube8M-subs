second is over there but I had some

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.620 
second is over there but I had some
hands-on<00:00:14.040> without<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.340> Tifa<00:00:14.790> so<00:00:15.300> I<00:00:15.330> wanted<00:00:15.540> to

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
because I'm a bit of a Galaxy Tab 7 fan

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.550 
because I'm a bit of a Galaxy Tab 7 fan
since<00:00:20.790> they<00:00:21.029> launched<00:00:21.540> over<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.840> year<00:00:22.140> ago<00:00:22.439> and

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
since they launched over a year ago and

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.800 
since they launched over a year ago and
course<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:22.950> one<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.369> throwing<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.390> dual-core

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
course this one is throwing a dual-core

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.220 
course this one is throwing a dual-core
1.2<00:00:25.410> Giga<00:00:26.130> 1.2<00:00:27.000> gigahertz<00:00:27.300> processor<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:28.079> here

1.2 Giga 1.2 gigahertz processor in here
dual<00:00:28.500> core<00:00:28.970> remember<00:00:32.059> this<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.390> 1.2

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809

gigahertz<00:00:34.170> through<00:00:34.469> core<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.680> found<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.100> think

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
gigahertz through core I found I think

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.720 
gigahertz through core I found I think
it<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.730> anyway<00:00:36.330> it's<00:00:36.480> learning<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.780> honeycomb

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
it is anyway it's learning a honeycomb

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.100 
it is anyway it's learning a honeycomb
this<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.970> actually<00:00:39.420> going<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.630> get<00:00:39.690> Ice<00:00:39.870> Cream

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
this is actually going to get Ice Cream

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.810 
this is actually going to get Ice Cream
Sandwich<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.680> think<00:00:40.950> Samsung<00:00:41.190> announced<00:00:41.550> that

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
Sandwich I think Samsung announced that

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.300 
Sandwich I think Samsung announced that
their<00:00:42.120> recently<00:00:42.660> it's<00:00:43.440> on<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.710> lists<00:00:44.040> for

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:44.310 
their recently it's on the lists for

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.700 
their recently it's on the lists for
upgrade<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.880> Ice<00:00:45.000> Cream<00:00:45.240> Sandwich<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.930> know<00:00:46.560> the

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
upgrade to Ice Cream Sandwich I know the

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.040 
upgrade to Ice Cream Sandwich I know the
77<00:00:47.340> is

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.100 

okay<00:00:54.010> but<00:00:54.790> I<00:00:54.850> think<00:00:55.270> I<00:00:55.480> read<00:00:55.690> somewhere<00:00:55.960> that

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
okay but I think I read somewhere that

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.870 
okay but I think I read somewhere that
it<00:00:56.290> would<00:00:56.410> be<00:00:56.560> I<00:00:56.890> mean<00:00:57.070> it<00:00:57.280> makes<00:00:57.400> sense<00:00:57.550> that

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880 
it would be I mean it makes sense that

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.640 
it would be I mean it makes sense that
it<00:00:57.970> would<00:00:58.060> get<00:00:58.180> upgrade<00:00:58.600> right<00:00:58.870> house<00:00:59.500> it's

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.650 
it would get upgrade right house it's

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.300 
it would get upgrade right house it's
not<00:00:59.770> even<00:00:59.950> launched<00:01:00.280> yet<00:01:02.070> well<00:01:03.070> this<00:01:03.190> is

running<00:02:32.810> on<00:02:33.019> the<00:02:33.260> original<00:02:33.680> Galaxy<00:02:33.859> Tab<00:02:34.340> so

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
running on the original Galaxy Tab so

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.569 
running on the original Galaxy Tab so
screen<00:02:36.980> viewing<00:02:37.819> angles<00:02:38.349> not<00:02:39.349> exactly<00:02:39.709> a<00:02:39.799> IPS

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
screen viewing angles not exactly a IPS

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:41.940 
screen viewing angles not exactly a IPS
but<00:02:40.790> actually<00:02:41.090> better<00:02:41.359> than<00:02:41.599> the<00:02:41.689> original

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
but actually better than the original

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.879 
but actually better than the original
Galaxy<00:02:42.950> Tab<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:44.840> it's<00:02:45.019> so<00:02:45.170> why<00:02:45.319> do<00:02:45.379> for<00:02:45.769> our

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:45.889 
Galaxy Tab and it's so why do for our

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:49.240 
Galaxy Tab and it's so why do for our
600<00:02:46.489> I<00:02:46.549> believe<00:02:46.760> as<00:02:46.909> well<00:02:47.829> so<00:02:48.829> I've<00:02:48.950> heard<00:02:49.129> that

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
600 I believe as well so I've heard that

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.530 
600 I believe as well so I've heard that
this<00:02:49.400> is<00:02:49.549> going<00:02:49.669> to<00:02:49.760> be<00:02:49.819> available<00:02:50.180> in<00:02:50.239> Europe

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
this is going to be available in Europe

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.349 
this is going to be available in Europe
from<00:02:50.629> the<00:02:50.720> 16th<00:02:51.319> of<00:02:51.560> January<00:02:52.549> we're<00:02:53.150> pretty

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 
from the 16th of January we're pretty

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.659 
from the 16th of January we're pretty
reasonable<00:02:53.870> price<00:02:53.900> so<00:02:54.530> now<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.340> guys<00:02:55.639> have

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:55.669 
reasonable price so now the guys have

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:57.909 
reasonable price so now the guys have
original<00:02:56.359> Galaxy<00:02:56.720> Tab<00:02:56.959> is<00:02:57.109> even<00:02:57.349> cheaper

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:57.919 
original Galaxy Tab is even cheaper

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:00.069 
original Galaxy Tab is even cheaper
though<00:02:58.299> so<00:02:59.299> wonder<00:02:59.719> where<00:02:59.840> there<00:02:59.959> any

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.079 
though so wonder where there any

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.199 
though so wonder where there any
original<00:03:00.650> Galaxy<00:03:00.980> Tab<00:03:01.219> owners<00:03:01.969> would<00:03:02.090> upgrade

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
original Galaxy Tab owners would upgrade

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.909 
original Galaxy Tab owners would upgrade
to<00:03:02.599> this<00:03:02.780> or<00:03:03.409> whether<00:03:03.560> they<00:03:03.739> go<00:03:03.919> for<00:03:04.219> the<00:03:05.919> 7

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:06.919 
to this or whether they go for the 7

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:08.770 
to this or whether they go for the 7
point<00:03:07.129> 7<00:03:07.189> that's<00:03:07.669> there<00:03:07.909> which<00:03:08.150> is<00:03:08.299> a<00:03:08.659> little

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
point 7 that's there which is a little

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.509 
point 7 that's there which is a little
bit<00:03:08.989> more<00:03:09.200> attractive<00:03:09.560> in<00:03:09.919> terms<00:03:09.950> of<00:03:10.400> screen

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
bit more attractive in terms of screen

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.800 
bit more attractive in terms of screen
so<00:03:13.519> that's<00:03:13.609> chippy<00:03:13.939> futari<00:03:14.299> paired<00:03:14.569> at

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
so that's chippy futari paired at

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.209 
so that's chippy futari paired at
peppercorn<00:03:15.709> with<00:03:15.919> the<00:03:16.040> Galaxy<00:03:16.519> Tab<00:03:16.669> 7<00:03:17.000> plus
