because<00:04:11.480> sometimes

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
because sometimes

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.570 
because sometimes
you<00:04:12.200> know<00:04:12.290> things<00:04:12.650> get<00:04:12.830> lost<00:04:13.010> in<00:04:13.220> translation

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
their first language or anything like

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.970 
their first language or anything like
that<00:04:19.760> but<00:04:20.209> it<00:04:20.750> definitely<00:04:20.989> wasn't<00:04:21.620> with<00:04:21.859> this
