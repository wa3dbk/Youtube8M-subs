00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
well this is what we're gonna do today

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.470 
well this is what we're gonna do today
we're<00:00:09.010> going<00:00:09.220> to<00:00:09.280> take<00:00:09.460> all<00:00:09.670> these<00:00:09.880> parts<00:00:10.300> off

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:10.480 
we're going to take all these parts off

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.569 
we're going to take all these parts off
of<00:00:10.750> this<00:00:10.990> block<00:00:11.469> right<00:00:12.599> here<00:00:14.249> and<00:00:15.249> we're<00:00:15.429> gonna

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:15.579 
of this block right here and we're gonna

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:17.850 
of this block right here and we're gonna
put<00:00:15.700> all<00:00:15.999> this<00:00:16.209> stuff<00:00:16.539> on<00:00:16.780> another<00:00:17.140> block<00:00:17.470> and

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.860 
put all this stuff on another block and

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.060 
put all this stuff on another block and
the<00:00:17.980> reason<00:00:18.369> is<00:00:19.140> if<00:00:20.140> you<00:00:20.170> look<00:00:20.320> back<00:00:20.710> here<00:00:21.010> in

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
the reason is if you look back here in

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.920 
the reason is if you look back here in
the<00:00:21.160> back<00:00:21.370> is<00:00:21.640> piston<00:00:22.240> I'll<00:00:23.080> show<00:00:23.410> you<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.810> it

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:25.930 
the back is piston I'll show you and it

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.750 
the back is piston I'll show you and it
moves<00:00:26.200> up<00:00:26.410> and<00:00:26.560> down<00:00:26.650> that's<00:00:27.010> got<00:00:27.220> a<00:00:27.250> lot<00:00:27.520> of

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 
moves up and down that's got a lot of

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.880 
moves up and down that's got a lot of
back-and-forth<00:00:28.540> on<00:00:29.080> the<00:00:29.140> opposite<00:00:31.890> it's

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
back-and-forth on the opposite it's

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:39.259 
back-and-forth on the opposite it's
pretty<00:00:33.129> good<00:00:33.250> gap<00:00:33.520> a<00:00:34.920> lot<00:00:35.920> of<00:00:37.289> see<00:00:38.289> it<00:00:38.379> there<00:00:38.410> a

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:39.269 
pretty good gap a lot of see it there a

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:43.139 
pretty good gap a lot of see it there a
lot<00:00:40.269> of<00:00:40.390> play<00:00:41.039> so<00:00:42.039> I'm<00:00:42.370> gonna<00:00:42.489> take<00:00:42.670> all<00:00:42.879> this

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149 
lot of play so I'm gonna take all this

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:49.290 
lot of play so I'm gonna take all this
off<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:45.370> put<00:00:45.489> it<00:00:45.789> on<00:00:45.909> a<00:00:46.620> different<00:00:47.620> block<00:00:48.300> and

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
off and put it on a different block and

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.979 
off and put it on a different block and
simply<00:00:49.870> run<00:00:50.499> it<00:00:51.089> so<00:00:52.089> I'm<00:00:52.149> gonna<00:00:52.329> cut<00:00:52.510> y'all<00:00:52.719> off

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
simply run it so I'm gonna cut y'all off

00:00:52.989 --> 00:01:07.050 
simply run it so I'm gonna cut y'all off
and<00:00:54.030> we're<00:00:55.030> gonna<00:00:55.179> get<00:00:55.269> to<00:00:55.479> it

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.130 

yeah<00:01:07.750> this<00:01:08.050> engine<00:01:08.910> well<00:01:09.910> I've<00:01:10.060> tried<00:01:10.270> I've

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
yeah this engine well I've tried I've

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.990 
yeah this engine well I've tried I've
got<00:01:11.410> a<00:01:11.440> lot<00:01:11.680> of<00:01:11.710> experience<00:01:12.280> a<00:01:12.700> lot<00:01:13.210> of<00:01:15.000> own

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
got a lot of experience a lot of own

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.130 
got a lot of experience a lot of own
hands<00:01:16.660> and<00:01:16.900> education<00:01:17.620> I<00:01:18.930> won't<00:01:19.930> make<00:01:20.110> a

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
hands and education I won't make a

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.280 
hands and education I won't make a
mistake<00:01:20.620> like<00:01:20.650> I<00:01:20.979> made<00:01:21.190> on<00:01:21.370> this<00:01:21.460> angel<00:01:21.880> again

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
mistake like I made on this angel again

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.190 
mistake like I made on this angel again
because<00:01:23.290> of<00:01:23.320> the<00:01:24.240> learning<00:01:25.240> experience<00:01:25.600> I

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
because of the learning experience I

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
because of the learning experience I
guess<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:37.270> was<00:01:37.570> good<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.840> I<00:01:44.590> think<00:01:44.979> I<00:01:45.190> just

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
guess it was good and I think I just

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.920 
guess it was good and I think I just
thought<00:01:45.640> it<00:01:45.790> would<00:01:45.910> just<00:01:45.940> start<00:01:46.330> right<00:01:46.509> on<00:01:46.540> up

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
thought it would just start right on up

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.430 
thought it would just start right on up
I'm<00:01:47.350> in<00:01:47.530> the<00:01:47.649> other<00:01:47.770> ones<00:01:48.009> have<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:50.200> course

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
I'm in the other ones have of course

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.620 
I'm in the other ones have of course
this<00:01:50.680> one<00:01:50.920> didn't<00:01:51.220> get<00:01:51.399> the<00:01:51.640> treatment<00:01:52.270> that

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
this one didn't get the treatment that

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.930 
this one didn't get the treatment that
the<00:01:53.170> other<00:01:53.289> ones<00:01:53.560> did<00:01:53.770> you<00:01:54.160> know<00:01:54.280> new<00:01:54.490> rain<00:01:54.759> is

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
the other ones did you know new rain is

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.360 
the other ones did you know new rain is
a<00:01:54.970> course<00:01:55.330> but

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.490 

just<00:02:01.370> the<00:02:01.610> I<00:02:02.030> guess<00:02:02.360> the<00:02:02.510> bearable

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.650 

alright<00:02:06.500> I<00:02:06.530> guess<00:02:06.830> no<00:02:06.980> I<00:02:07.010> need<00:02:07.370> to<00:02:07.490> reset<00:02:08.030> and

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
alright I guess no I need to reset and

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.300 
alright I guess no I need to reset and
get<00:02:09.140> me<00:02:09.320> a<00:02:09.350> wrench<00:02:09.650> and<00:02:09.890> get<00:02:10.070> that<00:02:10.280> off<00:02:10.460> and

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
get me a wrench and get that off and

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.950 
get me a wrench and get that off and
then<00:02:13.310> we're<00:02:13.460> gonna<00:02:13.610> get<00:02:13.730> these<00:02:13.940> flywheels<00:02:14.240> and

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
then we're gonna get these flywheels and

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.470 
then we're gonna get these flywheels and
you<00:02:15.020> see<00:02:15.170> there<00:02:15.350> there's<00:02:15.590> hardly<00:02:15.980> no

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
you see there there's hardly no

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.530 
you see there there's hardly no
compression<00:02:17.480> at<00:02:17.600> all<00:02:18.730> you<00:02:19.730> hear<00:02:19.970> it<00:02:20.090> there<00:02:20.300> but

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
compression at all you hear it there but

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.410 
compression at all you hear it there but
that's<00:02:20.720> not<00:02:20.990> i'm<00:02:21.830> just<00:02:21.890> easily<00:02:22.850> pulling

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
that's not i'm just easily pulling

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.710 
that's not i'm just easily pulling
through<00:02:23.690> and<00:02:24.520> it's<00:02:25.520> losing<00:02:25.820> you<00:02:26.270> hear<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.570> air

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
through and it's losing you hear the air

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:35.230 
through and it's losing you hear the air
back<00:02:26.990> here<00:02:27.200> in<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.350> back<00:02:33.820> when<00:02:34.820> we<00:02:34.940> put<00:02:35.120> this

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
back here in the back when we put this

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.790 
back here in the back when we put this
other<00:02:35.450> one<00:02:35.660> together<00:02:35.810> we're<00:02:36.230> gonna<00:02:36.410> check<00:02:36.620> the

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
other one together we're gonna check the

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.820 
other one together we're gonna check the
compression<00:02:37.340> on<00:02:37.460> there<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:39.110> i'd<00:02:39.320> say<00:02:39.350> it's

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
compression on there and i'd say it's

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:47.230 
compression on there and i'd say it's
gonna<00:02:40.040> be<00:02:40.160> a<00:02:41.980> lot<00:02:42.980> more<00:02:44.740> I<00:02:45.740> look<00:02:46.460> very<00:02:46.490> snowing

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
wheels off and got them inside when I

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.240 
wheels off and got them inside when I
guess<00:03:08.540> what<00:03:08.840> I'm<00:03:08.959> gonna<00:03:09.350> do<00:03:09.620> is<00:03:09.860> I'm<00:03:10.010> going<00:03:10.190> to
