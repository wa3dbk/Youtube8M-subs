00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
ahead play this video so let's get

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.920 
ahead play this video so let's get
started<00:00:38.219> first<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.270> all<00:00:39.390> mean<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.690> go<00:00:39.809> ahead

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
started first of all mean to go ahead

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.220 
started first of all mean to go ahead
and<00:00:40.230> open<00:00:40.440> up<00:00:40.469> on<00:00:40.680> Twitter<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.930> Automator<00:00:42.930> is

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
and open up on Twitter so Automator is

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.830 
and open up on Twitter so Automator is
basically<00:00:43.829> creating<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.399> workflow<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.149> will

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
basically creating a workflow that will

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.479 
basically creating a workflow that will
display<00:00:46.230> all<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.710> required<00:00:47.430> information

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
display all the required information

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.450 
display all the required information
actually<00:00:48.300> convert<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.930> into<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.230> text<00:00:49.500> file<00:00:49.829> now

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
actually convert it into a text file now

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.400 
actually convert it into a text file now
geektool<00:00:51.270> will<00:00:51.449> actually<00:00:51.750> display<00:00:51.960> all<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
geektool will actually display all the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.410 
geektool will actually display all the
information<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.070> txt<00:00:53.309> file<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.670> your<00:00:53.760> desktop

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
information and txt file in your desktop

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.850 
information and txt file in your desktop
so<00:00:54.629> that's<00:00:54.809> what<00:00:54.960> we're<00:00:55.110> going<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.770> be<00:00:55.800> using

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
so that's what we're going to be using

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.709 
so that's what we're going to be using
automator<00:00:56.460> for<00:00:56.730> so<00:00:56.910> go<00:00:57.000> ahead<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.300> click<00:00:57.539> on

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
automator for so go ahead and click on

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.420 
automator for so go ahead and click on
the<00:00:57.870> workflow<00:00:58.350> option<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.829> click<00:00:58.859> on<00:00:59.190> choose

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.809 
this and then drag a new she'll tell me
much<00:03:36.930> easier<00:03:37.199> to<00:03:37.290> identify<00:03:37.440> now<00:03:38.370> go<00:03:38.579> ahead<00:03:38.609> to

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
much easier to identify now go ahead to

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.909 
much easier to identify now go ahead to
back<00:03:38.970> to<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.180> text<00:03:39.510> file<00:03:39.690> and<00:03:39.870> you<00:03:40.620> want<00:03:40.769> to<00:03:40.829> go

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
back to the text file and you want to go

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:43.430 
back to the text file and you want to go
ahead<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.340> copy<00:03:41.669> this<00:03:42.120> first<00:03:42.419> code<00:03:42.659> when<00:03:43.349> it

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
ahead and copy this first code when it

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.430 
ahead and copy this first code when it
says<00:03:43.590> refresh<00:03:44.040> code<00:03:44.310> i'm<00:03:44.430> going<00:03:44.729> to<00:03:44.819> copy<00:03:44.970> this

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
says refresh code i'm going to copy this

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.289 
says refresh code i'm going to copy this
command<00:03:46.440> C<00:03:46.829> and<00:03:47.340> now<00:03:47.489> this<00:03:47.729> will<00:03:47.849> basically<00:03:48.000> be

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
command C and now this will basically be

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.059 
command C and now this will basically be
the<00:03:48.419> code<00:03:48.750> which<00:03:49.019> will<00:03:49.049> refresh<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.859> Quetelet

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
the code which will refresh the Quetelet

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.309 
the code which will refresh the Quetelet
so<00:03:50.699> basically<00:03:50.970> refresh<00:03:51.449> the<00:03:51.659> notifications

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
so basically refresh the notifications

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.780 
so basically refresh the notifications
you<00:03:52.409> get<00:03:52.590> and<00:03:53.040> you<00:03:53.069> can<00:03:53.280> adjust<00:03:53.370> it<00:03:53.609> to<00:03:53.639> how

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
you get and you can adjust it to how

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.879 
you get and you can adjust it to how
much<00:03:53.909> ever<00:03:54.150> you<00:03:54.180> want<00:03:54.510> so<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:55.019> time<00:03:55.199> limit<00:03:55.470> it

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
much ever you want so the time limit it

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:57.559 
much ever you want so the time limit it
can<00:03:56.040> always<00:03:56.280> change<00:03:56.400> that<00:03:56.669> go<00:03:57.269> ahead<00:03:57.419> and

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
can always change that go ahead and

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.599 
can always change that go ahead and
command<00:03:57.840> V<00:03:58.049> now<00:03:58.530> make<00:03:58.769> sure<00:03:58.799> if<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.459> have

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
command V now make sure if you have

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:03.289 
command V now make sure if you have
actually<00:03:59.909> changed<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.859> title<00:04:01.859> or<00:04:02.299> where

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
actually changed the title or where

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:04.580 
actually changed the title or where
you've<00:04:03.449> saved<00:04:03.689> it<00:04:03.840> make<00:04:04.079> sure<00:04:04.260> you<00:04:04.379> change

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
you've saved it make sure you change

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.679 
you've saved it make sure you change
this<00:04:04.799> according<00:04:05.370> to<00:04:05.430> your<00:04:05.489> path<00:04:05.699> so<00:04:06.030> if<00:04:06.449> you've

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:06.689 
this according to your path so if you've

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:08.990 
this according to your path so if you've
renamed<00:04:07.109> it<00:04:07.259> so<00:04:07.409> something<00:04:07.739> different<00:04:08.069> go

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
renamed it so something different go

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.819 
renamed it so something different go
ahead<00:04:09.239> and<00:04:09.419> change<00:04:09.599> this<00:04:09.720> I<00:04:10.019> have<00:04:10.319> renamed<00:04:10.620> it

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
ahead and change this I have renamed it

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:18.890 
ahead and change this I have renamed it
to<00:04:12.019> get<00:04:13.069> facebook<00:04:16.190> notifications

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
to get facebook notifications

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.479 
to get facebook notifications
dot<00:04:19.900> workflow<00:04:20.350> so<00:04:20.920> what<00:04:21.070> this<00:04:21.190> will<00:04:21.340> do<00:04:21.459> is

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
dot workflow so what this will do is
