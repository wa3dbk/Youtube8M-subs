00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
basically what you do is you count your

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.560 
basically what you do is you count your
beats<00:00:28.289> so<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.760> some<00:00:29.760> people<00:00:30.060> count<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.420> eight

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
beats so I some people count to eight

some people count to whatever number but

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.170 
some people count to whatever number but
i<00:00:33.239> think<00:00:33.360> four<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.380> most<00:00:34.590> easiest<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.340> on

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
i think four is the most easiest and on

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.220 
i think four is the most easiest and on
number<00:00:36.690> one<00:00:37.020> on<00:00:37.850> the<00:00:38.850> one<00:00:39.090> then<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.600> hit<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.050> so
