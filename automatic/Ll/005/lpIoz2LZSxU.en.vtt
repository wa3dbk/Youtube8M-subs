dis lens zoom lens just to don't work

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.810 
dis lens zoom lens just to don't work
why<00:00:24.810> didn't<00:00:25.080> L<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.650> motor<00:00:26.160> doesn't<00:00:26.550> work

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
why didn't L it the motor doesn't work

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.790 
why didn't L it the motor doesn't work
it<00:00:27.359> works<00:00:27.599> manually<00:00:29.150> it<00:00:30.150> can<00:00:30.750> shoot<00:00:30.990> at<00:00:31.260> 18

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
it works manually it can shoot at 18

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.979 
it works manually it can shoot at 18
frames<00:00:32.009> per<00:00:32.250> second<00:00:32.640> or<00:00:32.730> one<00:00:33.480> frame<00:00:33.750> at<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.930> time

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
frames per second or one frame at a time

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.310 
frames per second or one frame at a time
so<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:34.590> can<00:00:34.860> do<00:00:34.980> stop-motion<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.940> he<00:00:36.719> has<00:00:37.290> a

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
so you can do stop-motion and he has a

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.220 
so you can do stop-motion and he has a
slow<00:00:37.710> motion<00:00:37.980> button<00:00:38.790> which<00:00:39.450> when<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.870> press

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
it starts shooting faster so once you

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.680 
it starts shooting faster so once you
protect<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.050> at<00:00:46.940> normal<00:00:47.940> rate<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.360> will<00:00:48.510> see

it<00:00:48.780> at<00:00:49.260> slow<00:00:49.710> motion<00:00:50.899> here<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.079> can<00:00:52.260> work<00:00:52.469> it

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
it at slow motion here you can work it

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.279 
it at slow motion here you can work it
on<00:00:52.710> auto<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.520> manual<00:00:53.730> I'm<00:00:54.629> gonna<00:00:54.870> turn<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.230> on
