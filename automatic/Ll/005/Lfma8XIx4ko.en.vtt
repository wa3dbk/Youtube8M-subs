00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:24.759 
happy and confused hopefully that won't

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.829 
happy and confused hopefully that won't
lower<00:00:24.970> the<00:00:25.119> quality<00:00:25.269> of<00:00:26.050> my<00:00:26.829> narration<00:00:27.839> anyway

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:28.839

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:31.859 
lower the quality of my narration anyway
at<00:00:29.320> this<00:00:29.439> point<00:00:29.710> I<00:00:30.070> thought<00:00:30.909> the<00:00:31.390> controller

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
at this point I thought the controller

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.490 
at this point I thought the controller
wasn't<00:00:32.200> configured<00:00:32.680> but<00:00:32.980> it<00:00:33.220> was<00:00:33.550> I<00:00:34.540> managed

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
wasn't configured but it was I managed

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.040 
wasn't configured but it was I managed
to<00:00:35.560> use<00:00:35.980> my<00:00:36.160> ps3<00:00:36.430> controller<00:00:37.000> so<00:00:37.570> it<00:00:37.870> feels

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
to use my ps3 controller so it feels

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.070 
to use my ps3 controller so it feels
exactly<00:00:38.470> how<00:00:38.770> it<00:00:38.950> would<00:00:39.040> normally<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:40.780> part

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
exactly how it would normally this part

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.380 
exactly how it would normally this part
i'm<00:00:41.230> going<00:00:41.500> to<00:00:41.590> be<00:00:41.710> getting<00:00:41.860> the<00:00:42.400> blue<00:00:42.730> jam<00:00:43.120> and

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
i'm going to be getting the blue jam and

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.520 
i'm going to be getting the blue jam and
the<00:00:43.840> crystal<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:46.270> get<00:00:46.450> the<00:00:46.630> blue<00:00:46.870> gem<00:00:47.140> what<00:00:47.440> you

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
the crystal to get the blue gem what you

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.380 
the crystal to get the blue gem what you
have<00:00:47.650> to<00:00:47.680> do<00:00:47.950> is<00:00:48.160> you<00:00:48.280> have<00:00:48.310> to<00:00:48.670> complete<00:00:49.210> the

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
have to do is you have to complete the

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.800 
have to do is you have to complete the
level<00:00:49.510> without<00:00:51.030> opening<00:00:52.030> any<00:00:52.180> of<00:00:52.540> the<00:00:52.660> boxes

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:52.810 
level without opening any of the boxes

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.170 
level without opening any of the boxes
and<00:00:53.290> you'll<00:00:53.890> notice<00:00:54.130> i'll<00:00:54.610> do<00:00:54.940> a<00:00:54.970> lot<00:00:55.150> of

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
and you'll notice i'll do a lot of

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.000 
and you'll notice i'll do a lot of
sliding<00:00:55.510> and<00:00:55.750> juggling<00:00:56.080> because<00:00:56.470> it

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
sliding and juggling because it

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.150 
sliding and juggling because it
increases<00:00:57.310> my<00:00:57.640> speed<00:00:57.820> a<00:00:58.030> lot<00:00:58.240> i<00:00:58.680> never<00:00:59.680> done<00:01:00.010> it

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
increases my speed a lot i never done it

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.510 
increases my speed a lot i never done it
before<00:01:02.070> this<00:01:03.509> few<00:01:04.509> days<00:01:05.170> of<00:01:05.530> playing<00:01:06.159> the<00:01:06.340> game

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
before this few days of playing the game

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.000 
before this few days of playing the game
I<00:01:07.049> managed<00:01:08.049> to<00:01:08.110> get<00:01:08.290> it<00:01:08.439> working<00:01:08.590> on<00:01:08.890> my

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
I managed to get it working on my

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.370 
I managed to get it working on my
computer<00:01:09.490> so<00:01:10.270> that<00:01:10.300> i'm<00:01:10.540> recording<00:01:10.990> it<00:01:11.110> it's

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
computer so that i'm recording it it's

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.080 
computer so that i'm recording it it's
just<00:01:11.590> so<00:01:11.680> much<00:01:11.740> easier<00:01:11.860> me

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.010 

I'd<00:01:16.630> be<00:01:16.869> practicing<00:01:17.469> I've<00:01:18.159> half<00:01:19.030> completed

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
I'd be practicing I've half completed

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.069 
I'd be practicing I've half completed
the<00:01:20.380> non<00:01:20.799> recording<00:01:21.549> version<00:01:22.000> this<00:01:22.869> is<00:01:22.929> the

you<00:01:46.539> can<00:01:46.569> see<00:01:46.810> at<00:01:46.899> that<00:01:47.020> point<00:01:47.259> you<00:01:47.289> have<00:01:47.530> to

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
you can see at that point you have to

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.630 
you can see at that point you have to
jump<00:01:48.130> over<00:01:48.399> that<00:01:48.520> part<00:01:49.890> by<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:51.250> bowels<00:01:51.579> of

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
jump over that part by the bowels of

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.080 
jump over that part by the bowels of
lock<00:01:51.880> otherwise<00:01:52.360> the<00:01:52.569> break<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:53.020> blocks<00:01:53.259> and

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
lock otherwise the break the blocks and

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.760 
lock otherwise the break the blocks and
also<00:01:55.090> you<00:01:55.149> can<00:01:55.420> see<00:01:55.569> I<00:01:55.599> slide<00:01:56.020> over<00:01:56.439> that<00:01:56.560> hole

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
also you can see I slide over that hole

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.499 
also you can see I slide over that hole
if<00:01:57.009> I<00:01:57.130> fell<00:01:57.310> down<00:01:57.340> that<00:01:57.610> hole<00:01:57.789> I<00:01:58.030> would<00:01:58.360> be

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
if I fell down that hole I would be

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.529 
if I fell down that hole I would be
required<00:01:58.750> to<00:01:59.020> kill<00:02:00.119> enemies<00:02:01.119> at<00:02:01.270> come<00:02:01.420> out<00:02:01.479> of

know<00:03:28.550> somehow<00:03:28.730> I<00:03:28.880> did<00:03:29.150> it<00:03:29.270> but<00:03:29.450> I<00:03:29.510> did<00:03:29.780> it<00:03:30.370> I'm

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
know somehow I did it but I did it I'm

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.040 
know somehow I did it but I did it I'm
not<00:03:31.730> going<00:03:31.970> to<00:03:32.030> skip<00:03:32.210> them<00:03:32.420> and<00:03:32.660> I'm<00:03:32.750> going<00:03:32.990> to

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
not going to skip them and I'm going to

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.660 
not going to skip them and I'm going to
not<00:03:33.860> do<00:03:34.040> any<00:03:34.280> duration<00:03:35.030> during<00:03:35.510> those<00:03:36.080> times
