00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 the electric companies are 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.970
 making a change of meters 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.560
 Individuals for Spanish homes 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.599
 which are more expensive and increase 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.820
 exponentially the level of radiations 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.190
 carcinogenic for the Spanish population 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.960
 an already dangerous level thanks 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.240
 to the proliferation of antennae 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.510
 mobile telephony and the popularization of 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.580
 the wifi networks plus the accuracy of 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.590
 the data they transmit make people fear the 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.289
 presence of a particular big brother 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.210
 in each house the alarm has jumped with 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.250
 information from organizations 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.440
 environmental issues that follow the matter from 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.870
 that the companies endesa iberdrola and union 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.000
 fenosa began the replacement of the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.430
 old light counters by the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.129
 new telemetric devices in various 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.550
 Spanish areas such as asturias castilla 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.250
 the spot catalonia castilla and lion 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.219
 Valencian community galicia murcia and 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.379
 others the change of electric meters 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.300
 assumes that hundreds of 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.309
 thousands of antennas and transmitters 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.230
 radiations that will turn Spain into 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.449
 most polluted state territory 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.670
 electromagnetically of the world then 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.600
 these new although tiny sources 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.930
 radiation 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.909
 to add to the existing ones that level 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.799
 record of contamination is due to 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.290
 growth of infrastructures 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.560
 electric distribution and distribution 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.240
 transformation on the one hand and on the other hand 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.490
 exponential growth of 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.009
 telecommunications infrastructures 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.259
 for wimax and wifi telephony and the 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.920
 associated facilities such as stations 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.520
 mobile phone bases radio links 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.310
 repeaters micro femtocell antennas 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.659
 etc. explains pedro belmonte 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.700
 State responsible for pollution 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.399
 electromagnetic of ecologists in 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.500
 action curiously there is no 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.659
 state study on pollution 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.520
 electromagnetic or about how it has gone 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.920
 Evolving exposure to fields 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.259
 electromagnetic fields in urban environments and 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.840
 rural areas in the state 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.119
 belmonte which does not prevent the 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.649
 new regulations will be approved and applied 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.600
 a machamartillo and companies 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.240
 distributors already take care of 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.799
 publicize their supposed benefits even though 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.560
 increase the lack of control over the 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.600
 billing absence of studies 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.740
 previous evaluations makes 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.480
 companies 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.760
 can apply the new regulations 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.460
 state for the change of meters without 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:25.530
 no cortapisa the order it 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:28.260
 3 1860 2007 published in the boe of 29 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.330
 December 2007 established that 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.970
 all electric meters of 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.280
 power lower than 15 kw have to 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.620
 be replaced throughout Spain 'before 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.830
 of the end of 2018 by teams of 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.630
 meter remote control will be in total 13 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.510
 millions of meters those that 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.210
 they will renew then the gas will come and 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.910
 those of the water if already the network of antennas of 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.800
 it is inadmissible mobile phone 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.290
 will now increased so 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.630
 brutal electromagnetic radiation 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.560
 just when all the organisms 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.350
 international are recommending 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.800
 replace telephony antennas 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.110
 WiMAX wireless fiberoptic kafkiano 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.090
 says Miguel Jara prestigious 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.660
 specialist in research topics 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:15.210
 of health and ecology in the US unlike 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.280
 that in Spain the replacement of 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:21.610
 accountants is causing great opposition 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.740
 here according to the order mentioned the 35 by 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:28.720
 hundred of the meters must be new 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:32.920
 by the end of 2014 another 35% before 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:36.819
 that ends 2016 the remaining 30% to 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.980
 finish 2018 that is to say they have already started to 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.970
 be installed by endesa iberdrola in 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.030
 some places 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.459
 asturias cataluÃ±a and transmit the data 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.870
 to each central receiving by means of 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.000
 the cables of the electrical network 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.950
 conventional converted into a line 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.830
 high speed digital when using 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.510
 frequencies above 50 hertz 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.180
 is the normal of the electrical network 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.370
 regardless of whether those frequencies over 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.470
 of 50 hertz are considered 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.330
 directly harmful to the health of 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.940
 the people is the question of the 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.730
 data that are transmitted telemetry 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.550
 smart of those smart counters 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.620
 meters in English provides data that 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.600
 can be considered private over 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.720
 the activity that is in each housing 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.880
 when it starts when I just use 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.380
 has the kitchen or the television the 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.880
 computer or any other device 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.240
 connected to the network 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.860
 or wireless so the privacy of 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.140
 each home can be faithfully 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.920
 portrayed thanks to the new meters 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:37.720
 Telemetry of the electric companies 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.420
 all the more so when the substitution is made 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.310
 also with those of water and gas a great 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.410
 brother Orwellian and telemetric that 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.630
 throws even more shadows of doubt about the 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.580
 implantation initiated by the electric 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.130
 of the telemetric meters that 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.390
 They are also much more expensive than 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.390
 current analog
