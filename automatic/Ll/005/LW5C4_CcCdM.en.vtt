00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
figure completely with sculpey and then

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.920 
figure completely with sculpey and then
I<00:01:28.920> added<00:01:29.220> some<00:01:29.579> twisty<00:01:30.119> ties<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.720> back<00:01:30.900> of

I added some twisty ties to the back of

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.859 
I added some twisty ties to the back of
his<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.979> back<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.430> put<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> bunch<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.689> glue

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
his to the back and put a bunch of glue

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.170 
his to the back and put a bunch of glue
on<00:01:34.110> there<00:01:34.320> from<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.650> hot<00:01:34.829> glue<00:01:34.979> gun<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.490> that's

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
on there from a hot glue gun and that's

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.330 
on there from a hot glue gun and that's
how<00:01:36.299> i<00:01:36.390> made<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.750> tentacles<00:01:37.229> which<00:01:38.189> i

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
how i made the tentacles which i

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.210 
how i made the tentacles which i
completely<00:01:38.720> bendable<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.810> flexible<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:41.189> you

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
completely bendable and flexible so you

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.450 
completely bendable and flexible so you
can<00:01:41.520> pose<00:01:41.729> stars<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.930> whatever<00:01:43.320> move<00:01:44.100> our

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
can pose stars and whatever move our

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.300 
can pose stars and whatever move our
attack<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:45.060> want<00:01:45.299> him<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.600> look<00:01:45.750> like<00:01:46.189> can<00:01:47.189> go

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
attack you want him to look like can go

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:56.870 
attack you want him to look like can go
completely<00:01:47.729> out<00:01:54.560> it's<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.680> pretty<00:01:55.860> good<00:01:56.100> figure

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
completely out it's a pretty good figure

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:31.510 
completely out it's a pretty good figure
I<00:01:56.909> think

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.580 

you
