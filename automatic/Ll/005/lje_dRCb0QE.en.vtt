you<00:03:51.959> have<00:03:51.989> the<00:03:52.470> user<00:03:52.799> guide<00:03:53.040> which<00:03:53.939> I<00:03:54.060> guess

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
you have the user guide which I guess

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.749 
you have the user guide which I guess
this<00:03:54.389> is<00:03:54.569> more<00:03:54.810> like<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:55.109> manual<00:03:55.759> pretty

00:03:56.749 --> 00:03:56.759 
this is more like the manual pretty

00:03:56.759 --> 00:04:01.429 
this is more like the manual pretty
specific<00:03:57.239> ones<00:03:58.669> just<00:03:59.669> really<00:04:00.629> thick<00:04:00.959> manual

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 
specific ones just really thick manual

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:03.679 
specific ones just really thick manual
so<00:04:01.590> I<00:04:01.620> guess<00:04:01.799> it's<00:04:01.979> well-put-together<00:04:02.689> tells

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:03.689 
so I guess it's well-put-together tells

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:06.649 
so I guess it's well-put-together tells
you<00:04:03.810> a<00:04:03.840> lot<00:04:04.019> about<00:04:05.180> you<00:04:06.180> know<00:04:06.269> what<00:04:06.419> you<00:04:06.540> need

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
you a lot about you know what you need

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:08.810 
you a lot about you know what you need
to<00:04:06.750> know<00:04:06.810> it<00:04:07.109> actually

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
to know it actually

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.860 
to know it actually
what<00:04:09.820> part<00:04:10.090> of<00:04:10.180> the<00:04:10.300> ear<00:04:12.030> can<00:04:13.030> get<00:04:13.210> damaged<00:04:13.690> I

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
what part of the ear can get damaged I

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.450 
what part of the ear can get damaged I
guess<00:04:14.050> if<00:04:14.230> you<00:04:14.320> listen<00:04:14.590> to<00:04:14.620> it<00:04:14.740> too<00:04:14.950> loudly<00:04:15.220> you

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:15.460 
guess if you listen to it too loudly you

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.240 
guess if you listen to it too loudly you
can<00:04:15.610> see<00:04:15.730> important<00:04:16.270> safety<00:04:16.600> information<00:04:17.250> and

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
can see important safety information and

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.160 
can see important safety information and
then<00:04:18.610> you<00:04:19.090> see<00:04:19.270> all<00:04:19.390> the<00:04:19.480> parts<00:04:19.750> of<00:04:19.840> you<00:04:19.900> hear

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
then you see all the parts of you hear

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.950 
then you see all the parts of you hear
the<00:04:21.160> amount<00:04:21.580> of<00:04:21.640> decibels<00:04:22.180> coming<00:04:22.780> from

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
the amount of decibels coming from

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.760 
the amount of decibels coming from
certain<00:04:25.080> things<00:04:26.080> in<00:04:26.610> your<00:04:27.610> life<00:04:27.670> that<00:04:28.770> shows

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
certain things in your life that shows

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.640 
certain things in your life that shows
how<00:04:29.980> they<00:04:30.130> rank<00:04:30.340> in<00:04:30.700> how<00:04:31.150> bad<00:04:31.510> it<00:04:31.720> is<00:04:31.750> to<00:04:32.080> hear<00:04:32.440> I

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
how they rank in how bad it is to hear I

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.140 
how they rank in how bad it is to hear I
guess<00:04:33.130> we<00:04:33.280> should<00:04:33.430> probably<00:04:33.610> take<00:04:33.820> a<00:04:33.850> look<00:04:34.060> at

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
guess we should probably take a look at

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.450 
guess we should probably take a look at
the<00:04:34.210> actual<00:04:34.330> product<00:04:34.930> here<00:04:35.290> you<00:04:36.040> have<00:04:36.220> the

using an android which i would recommend

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.810 
using an android which i would recommend
installing<00:06:23.200> a<00:06:23.500> bass<00:06:23.710> booster<00:06:24.190> on<00:06:24.430> your<00:06:24.610> phone

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:26.980 
it really makes it sound really really

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.650 
it really makes it sound really really
really<00:06:27.310> good<00:06:27.580> in<00:06:27.700> these<00:06:27.790> headphones<00:06:28.000> are<00:06:28.450> like

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.660 
really good in these headphones are like

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.840 
really good in these headphones are like
an<00:06:28.780> equalizer<00:06:29.230> which<00:06:30.220> you<00:06:30.370> can<00:06:30.520> get<00:06:30.670> for<00:06:30.820> free

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:30.850 
an equalizer which you can get for free

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.500 
an equalizer which you can get for free
easily<00:06:32.430> it<00:06:33.430> makes<00:06:33.730> them<00:06:33.820> sound<00:06:34.030> a<00:06:34.300> lot<00:06:34.450> better

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:34.510 
easily it makes them sound a lot better

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.980 
easily it makes them sound a lot better
then<00:06:35.410> they<00:06:36.220> would<00:06:36.400> without<00:06:36.730> it<00:06:36.940> but<00:06:37.750> i<00:06:37.810> think

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
then they would without it but i think

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.660 
then they would without it but i think
on<00:06:38.080> an<00:06:38.200> ipod<00:06:38.560> if<00:06:38.710> you<00:06:38.830> have<00:06:38.950> look<00:06:39.160> as<00:06:39.370> it<00:06:39.520> does

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:39.670 
on an ipod if you have look as it does

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.240 
on an ipod if you have look as it does
when<00:06:39.850> you<00:06:39.910> buy<00:06:40.690> it<00:06:40.750> from<00:06:40.990> the<00:06:41.110> market<00:06:41.290> so<00:06:41.740> if

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.250 
when you buy it from the market so if

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.240 
when you buy it from the market so if
you<00:06:43.000> don't<00:06:43.120> have<00:06:43.330> an<00:06:43.480> iphone<00:06:43.870> or<00:06:43.900> ipod<00:06:44.410> then<00:06:44.950> I

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:45.250 
you don't have an iphone or ipod then I

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.650 
you don't have an iphone or ipod then I
think<00:06:45.520> you<00:06:45.580> probably<00:06:45.730> get<00:06:46.000> a<00:06:46.030> bass<00:06:46.240> booster

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:46.660 
think you probably get a bass booster

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.580 
think you probably get a bass booster
just<00:06:47.350> to<00:06:47.500> increase<00:06:47.680> the<00:06:48.540> you<00:06:49.540> know<00:06:49.630> quality

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:50.590 
just to increase the you know quality

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.140 
just to increase the you know quality
because<00:06:51.070> they<00:06:51.190> sound<00:06:51.490> great<00:06:51.730> they<00:06:51.880> have

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:52.150 
because they sound great they have

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.420 
because they sound great they have
really<00:06:52.420> good<00:06:52.540> bass<00:06:52.870> capability<00:06:53.500> it's<00:06:54.160> just

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:54.430 
really good bass capability it's just

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.960 
really good bass capability it's just
with<00:06:54.640> regular<00:06:55.030> music<00:06:56.130> it's<00:06:57.130> hard<00:06:57.280> to<00:06:57.400> hear<00:06:57.670> so

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:57.970 
with regular music it's hard to hear so

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:59.910 
with regular music it's hard to hear so
I<00:06:58.210> mean<00:06:58.900> if<00:06:58.990> you're<00:06:59.110> bigger<00:06:59.290> I'm<00:06:59.410> wrap<00:06:59.620> then

00:06:59.910 --> 00:06:59.920 
I mean if you're bigger I'm wrap then

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.060 
I mean if you're bigger I'm wrap then
definitely<00:07:00.910> get<00:07:01.120> the<00:07:01.180> base<00:07:01.330> blister<00:07:01.690> but<00:07:02.140> yeah

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:03.070 
definitely get the base blister but yeah
