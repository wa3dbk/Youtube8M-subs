00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
you'll actually get it to work with

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.089 
you'll actually get it to work with
human<00:00:23.400> skin<00:00:23.670> where<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.000> results<00:00:24.600> are<00:00:24.750> fine

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.459 
much but before I start I'm gonna make a
copy<00:01:58.829> of<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.280> layer<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.719> don't<00:02:00.930> have<00:02:01.200> to

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
copy of that layer and you don't have to

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.200 
copy of that layer and you don't have to
you<00:02:01.619> can<00:02:01.649> apply<00:02:02.100> all<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.490> changes<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.060> the

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
you can apply all the changes to the

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.950 
you can apply all the changes to the
background<00:02:03.600> layer<00:02:03.719> but<00:02:04.469> this<00:02:04.619> gives<00:02:04.829> us<00:02:05.040> the

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
background layer but this gives us the

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.919 
background layer but this gives us the
ability<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.399> reduce<00:02:08.399> opacity<00:02:08.640> for<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.599> effect

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
ability to reduce opacity for the effect

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.229 
ability to reduce opacity for the effect
that<00:02:09.989> we<00:02:10.170> want<00:02:10.440> if<00:02:10.649> it's<00:02:11.039> too<00:02:11.700> much<00:02:11.730> for<00:02:11.940> a

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
that we want if it's too much for a

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.340 
that we want if it's too much for a
particular<00:02:12.569> image

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350

let's go ahead here I'm gonna make a new
group<00:04:36.610> from<00:04:37.030> the<00:04:37.240> layers

00:04:37.649 --> 00:04:37.659 
group from the layers

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:41.010 
group from the layers
call<00:04:38.440> it<00:04:38.560> lab<00:04:39.419> so<00:04:40.419> I'm<00:04:40.509> going<00:04:40.629> to<00:04:40.690> take<00:04:40.810> those

call it lab so I'm going to take those

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.659 
call it lab so I'm going to take those
two<00:04:41.289> layers<00:04:41.500> that<00:04:41.770> I<00:04:41.889> changed<00:04:42.400> so<00:04:42.460> I'm<00:04:42.550> going

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
two layers that I changed so I'm going

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:45.510 
two layers that I changed so I'm going
to<00:04:42.699> group<00:04:42.909> them<00:04:43.060> together<00:04:43.240> and<00:04:44.159> what<00:04:45.159> I<00:04:45.190> want

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
to group them together and what I want

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.879 
to group them together and what I want
to<00:04:45.699> if<00:04:45.909> we<00:04:46.150> if<00:04:46.389> we<00:04:46.509> shut<00:04:46.870> that<00:04:46.900> off<00:04:47.080> this<00:04:47.590> is<00:04:47.860> the

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
to if we if we shut that off this is the

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.040 
to if we if we shut that off this is the
original<00:04:48.340> image<00:04:48.819> this<00:04:49.240> is<00:04:49.419> the<00:04:49.449> image<00:04:49.569> with

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
original image this is the image with

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.200 
original image this is the image with
the<00:04:50.080> color<00:04:50.379> change<00:04:50.800> to<00:04:51.099> it<00:04:51.280> you<00:04:51.460> see<00:04:51.669> that<00:04:51.849> if

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
the color change to it you see that if

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.050 
the color change to it you see that if
it's<00:04:53.199> too<00:04:53.530> much<00:04:53.770> if<00:04:53.949> it's<00:04:54.099> way<00:04:54.370> off<00:04:54.400> the<00:04:54.789> chart

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
it's too much if it's way off the chart

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.570 
it's too much if it's way off the chart
then<00:04:55.270> I<00:04:55.419> can<00:04:55.659> just<00:04:55.870> reduce<00:04:56.349> the<00:04:56.770> opacity<00:04:56.860> you

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
then I can just reduce the opacity you

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.580 
then I can just reduce the opacity you
know<00:04:57.729> that<00:04:57.909> worked<00:04:58.120> like<00:04:58.389> a<00:04:58.449> charm<00:04:58.780> I<00:04:59.080> can

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
know that worked like a charm I can

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.920 
know that worked like a charm I can
reduce<00:04:59.889> the<00:05:00.099> opacity<00:05:00.190> to<00:05:00.819> whatever<00:05:01.000> I<00:05:01.330> want<00:05:01.690> so

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
reduce the opacity to whatever I want so

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.809 
reduce the opacity to whatever I want so
that<00:05:02.050> we<00:05:02.229> can<00:05:02.409> actually<00:05:02.620> get<00:05:02.979> it<00:05:03.039> to<00:05:03.159> look<00:05:03.550> the

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:03.819 
that we can actually get it to look the

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:06.779 
that we can actually get it to look the
way<00:05:03.849> that<00:05:03.970> we<00:05:04.210> want<00:05:04.479> it<00:05:04.539> to<00:05:04.860> but<00:05:05.860> since<00:05:06.550> that<00:05:06.729> is

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:06.789 
way that we want it to but since that is

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:09.149 
way that we want it to but since that is
done<00:05:07.180> all<00:05:07.960> right<00:05:07.990> I<00:05:08.259> like<00:05:08.530> the<00:05:08.710> way<00:05:08.800> it<00:05:08.949> looks

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:09.159 
done all right I like the way it looks

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:11.820 
done all right I like the way it looks
at<00:05:09.340> 100%<00:05:10.000> I'm<00:05:10.870> going<00:05:11.050> to<00:05:11.110> go<00:05:11.229> ahead<00:05:11.349> and<00:05:11.740> I'm

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
at 100% I'm going to go ahead and I'm

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.700 
at 100% I'm going to go ahead and I'm
going<00:05:12.009> to<00:05:12.039> alter<00:05:12.460> this<00:05:12.610> back<00:05:12.970> to<00:05:13.300> to<00:05:13.990> a<00:05:14.020> Profoto

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
going to alter this back to to a Profoto

going to alter this back to to a Profoto
color<00:05:15.490> color<00:05:15.909> space<00:05:16.300> so<00:05:17.020> that<00:05:17.169> we<00:05:17.319> can<00:05:17.469> merge

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
color color space so that we can merge

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.899 
color color space so that we can merge
them<00:05:17.860> together<00:05:17.979> and<00:05:18.370> the<00:05:18.460> other<00:05:18.580> one<00:05:18.759> so<00:05:18.849> I'm

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:18.909 
them together and the other one so I'm

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:21.270 
them together and the other one so I'm
going<00:05:19.030> to<00:05:19.060> go<00:05:19.150> to<00:05:19.210> edit<00:05:19.750> convert<00:05:20.620> to<00:05:20.770> profile

going to go to edit convert to profile

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.450 
going to go to edit convert to profile
and<00:05:21.610> I'm<00:05:22.060> simply<00:05:22.509> going<00:05:22.690> to<00:05:22.750> go<00:05:22.990> back<00:05:23.440> to<00:05:23.469> to<00:05:24.430> a

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
and I'm simply going to go back to to a

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.610 
and I'm simply going to go back to to a
pro<00:05:24.909> photo<00:05:25.180> which<00:05:25.449> is<00:05:25.629> the<00:05:25.750> same<00:05:26.020> color<00:05:26.259> space
