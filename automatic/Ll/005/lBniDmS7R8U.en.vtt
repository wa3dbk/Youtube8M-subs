little<00:02:36.950> bit<00:02:37.310> jagged<00:02:37.550> so<00:02:37.970> I'm<00:02:38.090> going<00:02:38.240> to<00:02:38.270> clean

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
little bit jagged so I'm going to clean

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.540 
little bit jagged so I'm going to clean
that<00:02:38.540> up<00:02:41.230> that's<00:02:42.230> like<00:02:42.500> pretty<00:02:42.800> much<00:02:42.950> how<00:02:43.310> I<00:02:43.340> do

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
that up that's like pretty much how I do

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.630 
that up that's like pretty much how I do
my<00:02:43.640> eyeliner<00:02:44.050> like<00:02:45.050> as<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.740> product<00:02:46.190> kind<00:02:46.490> of

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
my eyeliner like as the product kind of

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.020 
my eyeliner like as the product kind of
like<00:02:46.850> starts<00:02:47.330> um<00:02:48.190> becoming<00:02:49.190> less<00:02:49.460> on<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:49.730> felt

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
like starts um becoming less on the felt

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.120 
like starts um becoming less on the felt
tip<00:02:50.240> that's<00:02:50.540> when<00:02:50.780> I<00:02:50.810> start<00:02:51.200> blending<00:02:51.650> a

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
tip that's when I start blending a

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.860 
tip that's when I start blending a
little<00:02:52.400> bit<00:02:52.520> more<00:02:52.760> so<00:02:53.030> that<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.390> line<00:02:53.600> looks

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
little bit more so that the line looks

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.640 
little bit more so that the line looks
completely<00:02:54.470> straight<00:02:55.040> so<00:02:56.440> yeah<00:02:57.440> that's

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
completely straight so yeah that's

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.530 
completely straight so yeah that's
pretty<00:02:57.800> much<00:02:58.040> it<00:02:58.160> so<00:02:58.310> I<00:02:58.460> hope<00:02:58.790> this<00:02:58.850> is<00:02:59.270> helpful
