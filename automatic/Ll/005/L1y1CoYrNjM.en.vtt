00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
sell on but let's be realistic there are

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.450 
sell on but let's be realistic there are
far<00:05:10.820> better<00:05:10.849> left<00:05:11.330> mid<00:05:11.510> options<00:05:11.990> in<00:05:12.200> the<00:05:12.890> Greek

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
far better left mid options in the Greek

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.330 
far better left mid options in the Greek
lead<00:05:13.700> a<00:05:13.729> Greek<00:05:14.450> league<00:05:14.840> as<00:05:15.050> well<00:05:15.470> as<00:05:15.680> from

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
lead a Greek league as well as from

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.550 
lead a Greek league as well as from
Argentina<00:05:17.060> and<00:05:17.360> so<00:05:17.900> the<00:05:18.080> chances<00:05:18.380> of<00:05:18.440> him

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
Argentina and so the chances of him

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.159 
Argentina and so the chances of him
selling<00:05:18.979> are<00:05:19.130> just<00:05:19.460> slim<00:05:19.940> to<00:05:20.180> none<00:05:20.419> but<00:05:20.479> after

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169
