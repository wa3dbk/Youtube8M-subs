so it's not getting green right now what

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.650 
so it's not getting green right now what
we<00:03:24.550> can<00:03:24.700> do<00:03:24.820> is<00:03:25.030> let's<00:03:25.570> check<00:03:25.840> if<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:28.180> ports

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
we can do is let's check if the ports

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:38.060 
we can do is let's check if the ports
are<00:03:29.020> being<00:03:29.770> used<00:03:30.130> by<00:03:30.430> some<00:03:31.360> other<00:03:31.540> service

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:43.320 

okay<00:03:39.070> so<00:03:40.470> basically<00:03:41.760> this<00:03:42.760> problem<00:03:43.120> occurs

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
okay so basically this problem occurs

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.770 
okay so basically this problem occurs
and<00:03:43.960> windows<00:03:44.800> II<00:03:45.030> mostly<00:03:46.030> in<00:03:46.150> Windows<00:03:46.420> 8<00:03:46.540> that

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
and windows II mostly in Windows 8 that

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.930 
and windows II mostly in Windows 8 that
the<00:03:47.020> report<00:03:47.590> ility<00:03:47.890> is<00:03:48.100> actually<00:03:48.580> used<00:03:48.760> by

in the installation of the BAM server

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.120 
in the installation of the BAM server
it's<00:05:09.190> in<00:05:09.370> the<00:05:09.460> C<00:05:09.670> Drive<00:05:09.790> C<00:05:10.600> Drive<00:05:10.810> Ram<00:05:11.320> folder

it's in the C Drive C Drive Ram folder

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.000 
it's in the C Drive C Drive Ram folder
over<00:05:13.120> here<00:05:13.360> you<00:05:13.660> can<00:05:13.810> find<00:05:14.140> all<00:05:14.380> these<00:05:14.710> files

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
over here you can find all these files

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.210 
over here you can find all these files
the<00:05:15.850> files<00:05:16.090> which<00:05:16.570> we<00:05:16.750> will<00:05:16.900> need<00:05:17.230> to<00:05:17.620> create<00:05:18.190> a

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
the files which we will need to create a

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.840 
the files which we will need to create a
web<00:05:18.490> page<00:05:18.700> are<00:05:19.890> going<00:05:20.890> to<00:05:21.010> be<00:05:21.420> inside<00:05:22.420> the<00:05:22.750> web

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
web page are going to be inside the web

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:29.560 
web page are going to be inside the web
server<00:05:24.850> or<00:05:27.210> /ww

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
server or /ww

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:37.050 
server or /ww
so<00:05:30.520> let's<00:05:31.520> go<00:05:31.730> ahead<00:05:31.790> and<00:05:33.460> run<00:05:35.050> the<00:05:36.050> localhost

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
so let's go ahead and run the localhost

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.460 
so let's go ahead and run the localhost
localhost<00:05:38.060> is<00:05:38.360> basically<00:05:38.960> your<00:05:39.260> root

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
localhost is basically your root

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.090 
localhost is basically your root
directory<00:05:39.880> so<00:05:41.260> this<00:05:42.260> is<00:05:42.380> your<00:05:42.560> root<00:05:42.710> directory

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.100 
directory so this is your root directory

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.900 
directory so this is your root directory
BAM<00:05:43.420> backward<00:05:44.420> slash<00:05:44.630> www<00:05:45.590> this<00:05:46.550> is<00:05:46.700> where

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
BAM backward slash www this is where

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.920 
BAM backward slash www this is where
localhost<00:05:47.570> actually<00:05:48.230> points<00:05:48.620> to<00:05:49.720> so<00:05:50.720> if<00:05:50.840> you

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
localhost actually points to so if you

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.360 
localhost actually points to so if you
type<00:05:51.080> localhost<00:05:51.410> in<00:05:51.680> your<00:05:51.770> address<00:05:51.920> bar<00:05:52.190> and

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
type localhost in your address bar and

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.030 
type localhost in your address bar and
