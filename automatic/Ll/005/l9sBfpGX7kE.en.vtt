00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello, I take this one that walks marks the beginning 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.420
 from the shift taking maidana and the great 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.420
 question is who is the best human rate 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:38.850
 she really likes that android does not 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:40.530
 It is today that it is incredible that it is good. 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.420
 I think he even fell short of what 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.879
 he is able to truly think it is the 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.010
 great controversy that took place in the exchange case 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.800
 ethnicity was not for nothing did not 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.270
 difference in the middle does not bother a 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.770
 way you know at the moment you're staying 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.780
 troubled by the changes already had 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.610
 another was done in such a subtle way 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.010
 so it is so consistent with that 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.079
 reality that beauty you buy it 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.640
 in the first few minutes it is presented 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.580
 this story, then it's very simple to 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.890
 explanation of the relationship of steel with 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.390
 them in terms of time to interact more 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.310
 small little exchanges looks 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.930
 small words have already shown that 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.150
 they like the other one who has a relationship 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.710
 long long ago and joe and the cast is 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.900
 interesting yes 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.460
 despite the controversy of the dentinho exchange but 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.140
 It's interesting that everyone can 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.210
 interpret well what is proposed in the 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.540
 script mainly after the cast 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.520
 of the old movie that saves me almost 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.490
 no one from the old cast movie 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.229
 I'm just going to the beauty of the quiet days, I guess. 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.450
 so after I 've seen one 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.240
 microphone as the human torch 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.200
 I looked and if I thought but neither of ours 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.170
 As you wish, you know it sounds like a 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.939
 college doing this he he did 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.909
 today history has always had this 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.700
 stereotype of your the guy the little playboy 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.500
 such and only preserving took it knows 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.570
 that they are you stop this much 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.850
 idea of ​​guy your playboy to be the 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.619
 catcher of your party guy and such 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.329
 with victory was a more subtle way but 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.340
 that within the reality of the film did 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.439
 complete sense so I guess 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.119
 but within the proposal of each film to 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.500
 Sorry guys, but maicon video is a lot 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.870
 more human torch than the captain 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.269
 America also runs a lot of 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.040
 good script I know that the context of 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.019
 creation of movie characters and has 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.930
 an actor with a good script is much better 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.549
 than the good or bad act is it has no way 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.560
 escape that wore had a script shit 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:28.590
 in that movie here as soon as 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.200
 attack that brings a reality to the 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.930
 viewers understood why it is a 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.360
 fiction movie can a little of the whole 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.080
 movie of heroes that bitter likes 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.170
 do 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.290
 understood and here he does something more intimate 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.760
 when to say 5 that spoke at the same level 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.060
 For me it was based much more on 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.860
 reality is less a fantastic thing 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.480
 11 weeks the fantastic quartet but it 's 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.400
 a fantastic thing 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.780
 It's one more thing on the floor like that. 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.940
 but it's a trip to another 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.519
 dimension you believe that it can 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.980
 the first two acts that 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:06.180
 built my characters very well 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.280
 so the actors know the cast so it is the 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.799
 quartet I felt they succeeded 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.269
 do your character well die linke 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.540
 He works very well with personality. 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.910
 adolescents who do not know how to deal 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.859
 shit that 's rolling with them in power 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.989
 and limit their fantastic quartet there 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.250
 are four teenagers and the cds are 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.540
 four teens who are giving 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.639
 that moral question and now I have 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.739
 here I do with this parade and stayed 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.239
 angry you have one thing and skin 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.889
 got scared is different from the other 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:36.299
 time people do and so could 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:39.150
 here they wanted the goal I played 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:41.489
 Mom is on fire and plays fun. 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.459
 you will understand that it is not something more serious 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.560
 more gentle to get into the other ready 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.840
 The vision he longs for does not 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.900
 the identity of the character sue shim ed 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.180
 xrx has raised threats to sound history 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.190
 produced the sound until the victor gift that is 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.260
 must be a shit in the movie leo victor 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.450
 More or less gift, for more than 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.579
 villain was not perhaps the point 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.370
 weak and the film is we had 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:07.410
 the first victor of megalomania personality 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.209
 that question of him wanting to be 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.859
 better than everyone to be envious 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.299
 of what others are working and 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.579
 I think his work is always better. 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.079
 but as I was discussing before 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.849
 I did not say the first one. 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.329
 according to the tualle of the film are 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:22.979
 interesting builds from small to 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:26.430
 adolescent to their adolescents 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:28.319
 there was too much explanation that a 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.240
 thing that could have put in the action 

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:32.430
 I missed the movie so much I liked the 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.099
 script then character development 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.080
 and development of science fiction 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:39.000
 I was also finding this drama 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.800
 the guys that he could I think the 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.419
 problem actually remains in third 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.949
 until they have to come to the quartet 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.780
 fantastic because the one quartet 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:49.039
 fantastic and the fantastic quartet for 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.990
 I'm four heroes ridiculous know 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:53.940
 is not forced precisely because 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.650
 It has to be a fantastic quartet them. 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.240
 They spent a lot with cuts I think 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.469
 that the first two were very good 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.080
 helping people care about the 

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:02.900
 characters and build people see them 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.030
 being built even with a friendship 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.440
 as a team and a partnership with 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.219
 they even speak after becoming a 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.379
 family 

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:12.810
 the disadvantage is the first group is a 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:14.580
 family super heroes of the final battle 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.889
 involves danger that what is good must 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.050
 call it make sense each 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:21.360
 I'll create a black hole there, the lightning bolt. 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.400
 in the sky I hate when I film in the sky 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.349
 spider man by lightning and what else 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.779
 ray in the sky brigadores by ray in the sky 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:32.190
 falls from the sky because that fucking sun p 

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:33.990
 now this fantastic quartet I think 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.240
 he hit more than missed but 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.889
 that we are fact that slid in the end 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.710
 and such but he accepted much more than he 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:42.930
 You're killing her. She's trying to kill you. 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.779
 find the way back is kind 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.150
 did it for me I think three stars is 

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:51.529
 enough for two extremes to me 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.529
 a little more famous four-star 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:00.070
 when he was a child his brother 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.660
 and off the stage the task of stopping there 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.400
 I did not need to mark him say anything. 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.720
 this will be our understanding that the 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.830
 The only thing I loved, they'll come here. 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.090
 It's fantastic because of the experiment. 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.950
 wrong but because the crime prescribed 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:16.770
 And now I love this great 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:16.770
 I think you end up talking on video too.
