so they they all operate differently and

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.200 
so they they all operate differently and
you<00:01:32.310> know<00:01:32.400> your<00:01:32.579> tactics<00:01:32.970> are<00:01:33.030> going<00:01:33.150> to

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
you know your tactics are going to

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.179 
you know your tactics are going to
change<00:01:33.420> based<00:01:33.720> on<00:01:33.900> who's<00:01:34.500> on<00:01:34.619> your<00:01:34.650> team<00:01:34.770> which

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
change based on who's on your team which

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.700 
change based on who's on your team which
figures<00:01:35.400> you're<00:01:35.640> operating<00:01:35.970> right<00:01:36.509> it's<00:01:37.470> it's

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
figures you're operating right it's it's

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.649 
figures you're operating right it's it's
a<00:01:37.860> turn-based<00:01:38.070> so<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:39.119> would<00:01:39.240> move<00:01:39.329> all<00:01:39.509> your

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
a turn-based so you would move all your

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:40.910 
a turn-based so you would move all your
figures<00:01:39.960> do<00:01:40.110> everything<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.439> want<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.680> do<00:01:40.770> and

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
figures do everything you want to do and

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.740 
figures do everything you want to do and
then<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.070> would<00:01:41.189> do<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.400> same<00:01:41.600> anybody<00:01:42.600> who's

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
then I would do the same anybody who's

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.050 
then I would do the same anybody who's
played<00:01:43.049> like<00:01:43.350> final<00:01:44.159> fantasy<00:01:44.189> tactics<00:01:44.670> or

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
played like final fantasy tactics or

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.060 
played like final fantasy tactics or
something<00:01:45.360> like<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.509> is<00:01:45.960> familiar<00:01:46.439> with<00:01:46.860> the

something like that is familiar with the

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.249 
something like that is familiar with the
you<00:01:47.610> know<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.909> core<00:01:48.240> concept<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.840> what<00:01:49.170> this

each of the figures has a level and it

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.590 
each of the figures has a level and it
it<00:02:10.369> tells<00:02:10.700> you<00:02:10.880> kind<00:02:11.210> of<00:02:11.270> gives<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:11.480> their

relative strength to the to the rest of
the<00:02:13.610> field<00:02:13.850> and<00:02:14.060> then<00:02:14.420> you<00:02:14.480> bring<00:02:14.660> a<00:02:14.810> team

to level six characters and I would have

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.770 
to level six characters and I would have
six<00:02:22.040> level<00:02:22.370> twos<00:02:22.550> and<00:02:22.880> then<00:02:23.210> we<00:02:23.300> would<00:02:23.450> you

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780

that<00:03:45.690> many<00:03:45.840> points<00:03:46.230> right<00:03:46.560> so<00:03:46.740> some<00:03:47.190> figures

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
that many points right so some figures

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.180 
that many points right so some figures
are<00:03:47.610> better<00:03:47.760> at<00:03:47.880> it<00:03:47.970> than<00:03:48.000> others<00:03:48.260> she<00:03:49.260> she

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
are better at it than others she she

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.800 
are better at it than others she she
rolls<00:03:50.370> to<00:03:50.610> dice<00:03:50.790> whenever<00:03:51.120> she<00:03:51.240> attacks<00:03:51.540> right

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
rolls to dice whenever she attacks right

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.780 
rolls to dice whenever she attacks right
she's<00:03:52.080> kind<00:03:52.260> of<00:03:52.290> a<00:03:52.380> heavy<00:03:52.560> hitter<00:03:52.770> this<00:03:53.550> guy<00:03:53.730> is

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
she's kind of a heavy hitter this guy is

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.310 
she's kind of a heavy hitter this guy is
hard<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.240> kill<00:03:54.420> so<00:03:54.600> he<00:03:54.750> rolls<00:03:54.930> to<00:03:55.140> dice

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
hard to kill so he rolls to dice

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.770 
hard to kill so he rolls to dice
whenever<00:03:55.620> he<00:03:55.800> defends<00:03:56.340> so<00:03:56.790> gives<00:03:57.510> a<00:03:57.570> little

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
whenever he defends so gives a little

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.200 
whenever he defends so gives a little
texture<00:03:58.050> to<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.410> to<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.710> figures

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210 
texture to the to the figures

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.690 
texture to the to the figures
and<00:04:01.170> so<00:04:01.470> so<00:04:01.770> it<00:04:01.830> goes<00:04:01.950> back<00:04:02.100> and<00:04:02.280> forth<00:04:02.340> until

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
and so so it goes back and forth until

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.420 
and so so it goes back and forth until
one<00:04:03.030> of<00:04:03.060> us<00:04:03.210> either<00:04:03.570> has<00:04:03.840> no<00:04:04.140> figures<00:04:04.530> or<00:04:04.920> no

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
one of us either has no figures or no

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.540 
one of us either has no figures or no
gallons<00:04:05.970> of<00:04:06.090> glory<00:04:06.330> and<00:04:06.860> it's<00:04:07.860> a<00:04:08.010> it's<00:04:08.340> not<00:04:08.490> a

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
gallons of glory and it's a it's not a

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.340 
gallons of glory and it's a it's not a

pushes it along yeah so I see some
special<00:04:21.120> powers<00:04:22.070> power-ups<00:04:23.070> and<00:04:23.310> abilities

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
special powers power-ups and abilities

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.930 
special powers power-ups and abilities
crates<00:04:24.420> yep<00:04:24.900> yep<00:04:25.080> so<00:04:25.290> yeah<00:04:26.010> so<00:04:26.280> the<00:04:26.400> terrain<00:04:26.790> is

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
crates yep yep so yeah so the terrain is

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.360 
crates yep yep so yeah so the terrain is
important<00:04:27.300> to<00:04:27.360> the<00:04:27.450> game<00:04:27.600> obviously<00:04:28.370> trees

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
important to the game obviously trees

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.000 
important to the game obviously trees
and<00:04:29.880> and<00:04:30.360> characters<00:04:31.110> will<00:04:31.350> block<00:04:31.590> line<00:04:31.830> of

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
and and characters will block line of

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.040 
and and characters will block line of
sight<00:04:32.190> for<00:04:32.490> spells<00:04:32.790> right<00:04:33.090> so<00:04:33.330> no<00:04:33.840> for

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
sight for spells right so no for

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.230 
sight for spells right so no for
instance<00:04:34.380> he<00:04:34.500> has<00:04:34.710> his<00:04:35.340> he's<00:04:35.760> super<00:04:36.090> long

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
instance he has his he's super long

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.670 
instance he has his he's super long
range<00:04:36.510> guy<00:04:36.690> and<00:04:36.930> so<00:04:37.050> hit<00:04:37.170> the<00:04:37.200> range<00:04:37.410> on<00:04:37.560> his

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
range guy and so hit the range on his

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.550 
range guy and so hit the range on his
spell<00:04:37.860> is<00:04:37.980> 328<00:04:38.370> which<00:04:39.000> will<00:04:39.240> count<00:04:39.560> orthogonal

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
spell is 328 which will count orthogonal

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.320 
spell is 328 which will count orthogonal
E<00:04:40.650> and<00:04:40.740> so<00:04:40.860> we<00:04:40.980> go<00:04:41.070> one<00:04:41.280> two<00:04:41.310> three<00:04:41.820> four<00:04:42.030> five

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
E and so we go one two three four five

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.330 
E and so we go one two three four five
six<00:04:42.660> seven<00:04:42.900> eight<00:04:43.200> like<00:04:43.350> that<00:04:43.560> and<00:04:43.800> as<00:04:44.100> long<00:04:44.190> as

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
six seven eight like that and as long as

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.590 
six seven eight like that and as long as
there<00:04:44.460> are<00:04:44.550> no<00:04:44.580> people<00:04:44.820> or<00:04:45.000> trees<00:04:45.240> in<00:04:45.360> the<00:04:45.450> way

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
there are no people or trees in the way

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.490 
there are no people or trees in the way
you<00:04:46.230> clear<00:04:47.160> shot<00:04:47.370> shoot<00:04:47.790> away<00:04:47.880> right<00:04:48.410> but<00:04:49.410> if

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
you clear shot shoot away right but if

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
you're standing on top of a crate that's

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.190 
you're standing on top of a crate that's
going<00:04:51.090> to<00:04:51.150> increase<00:04:51.390> the<00:04:51.660> outer<00:04:51.810> range<00:04:52.080> of

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
going to increase the outer range of

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.380 
going to increase the outer range of
your<00:04:52.320> spell<00:04:52.560> by<00:04:52.710> one<00:04:52.950> so<00:04:53.310> so<00:04:53.760> bill<00:04:53.970> on<00:04:54.060> top<00:04:54.210> of<00:04:54.330> a

your spell by one so so bill on top of a
crate<00:04:54.570> is<00:04:54.690> a<00:04:54.750> happy<00:04:54.990> guy<00:04:55.140> you<00:04:55.710> can<00:04:55.860> he<00:04:56.190> can<00:04:56.370> get

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
crate is a happy guy you can he can get

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.520 
crate is a happy guy you can he can get
you<00:04:56.820> know<00:04:56.910> almost<00:04:57.210> almost<00:04:57.510> all<00:04:57.780> over<00:04:58.050> all<00:04:58.470> over

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
you know almost almost all over all over

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.190 
you know almost almost all over all over
the<00:04:58.830> board<00:04:59.390> trees<00:05:00.390> and<00:05:00.630> shrubs<00:05:00.900> block

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
the board trees and shrubs block

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.780 
the board trees and shrubs block
movement<00:05:01.770> right<00:05:01.950> so<00:05:02.190> so<00:05:02.460> it<00:05:02.520> gives<00:05:02.580> a<00:05:02.700> little

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
movement right so so it gives a little

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.760 
movement right so so it gives a little
texture<00:05:03.090> to<00:05:03.210> the<00:05:03.330> board<00:05:03.600> and<00:05:03.660> figures<00:05:04.560> like

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
texture to the board and figures like

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.890 
texture to the board and figures like
bill<00:05:05.130> for<00:05:05.310> instance<00:05:05.610> again<00:05:05.820> he<00:05:06.330> doesn't<00:05:06.810> like

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
bill for instance again he doesn't like
