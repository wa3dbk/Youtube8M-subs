00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
little weight to it so I was obviously

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.330 
little weight to it so I was obviously
it's<00:01:36.390> going<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.750> with<00:01:37.049> being<00:01:37.439> silicone<00:01:37.920> and

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
it's going to with being silicone and

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.270 
it's going to with being silicone and
having<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.360> battery<00:01:39.630> built<00:01:39.840> into<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.530> you

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
having a battery built into it so you

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.980 
having a battery built into it so you
know<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.520> will<00:01:41.670> take<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.360> little<00:01:42.479> closer<00:01:42.750> look

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
know it will take a little closer look

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.850 
know it will take a little closer look
at<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:44.329> so<00:01:45.329> it's<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.509> one-piece<00:01:45.899> silicone

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
droid x so the power the USB port is on

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.900 
droid x so the power the USB port is on
the<00:03:27.660> side<00:03:27.900> of<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.650> device<00:03:28.950> so<00:03:29.700> you<00:03:29.730> can

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
the side of the the device so you can

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.320 
the side of the the device so you can
see<00:03:30.120> here<00:03:30.450> that<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:31.019> little<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:32.670> little<00:03:32.700> plug

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
see here that the little the little plug

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.449 
see here that the little the little plug
when<00:03:33.510> we<00:03:33.599> get<00:03:33.720> close<00:03:33.930> up<00:03:34.140> on<00:03:34.290> that<00:03:34.440> is<00:03:35.069> going<00:03:35.370> to

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
when we get close up on that is going to

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.160 
when we get close up on that is going to
be<00:03:35.549> on<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:35.760> side<00:03:35.970> as<00:03:36.209> well<00:03:38.720> now<00:03:39.720> they've<00:03:39.930> got

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
be on the side as well now they've got

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.810 
be on the side as well now they've got
some<00:03:40.500> recessed<00:03:40.890> some<00:03:41.190> buttons<00:03:41.519> here<00:03:41.670> and

some recessed some buttons here and
we'll<00:03:42.000> can't<00:03:42.870> really<00:03:43.049> test<00:03:43.350> those<00:03:43.560> until<00:03:43.859> we

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
we'll can't really test those until we

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.680 
we'll can't really test those until we
put<00:03:44.100> the<00:03:44.250> phone<00:03:44.730> in<00:03:44.910> so<00:03:45.269> let<00:03:45.390> me<00:03:45.420> go<00:03:45.510> ahead<00:03:45.540> and

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
correctly typical main thing here ya

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:00.429 
correctly typical main thing here ya
popped<00:03:58.280> right<00:03:58.519> in<00:03:58.639> nice<00:03:58.819> and<00:03:58.849> easy<00:03:59.319> turn<00:04:00.319> the

cool I'm going to go ahead and the
charging<00:06:29.440> port<00:06:29.620> for<00:06:29.830> the<00:06:30.690> for<00:06:31.690> the<00:06:31.720> case<00:06:31.960> is

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:32.170 
charging port for the for the case is

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.710 
charging port for the for the case is
down<00:06:32.320> the<00:06:32.500> bottom<00:06:32.800> there<00:06:33.450> and<00:06:34.450> i'll<00:06:34.540> figure

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 
down the bottom there and i'll figure
