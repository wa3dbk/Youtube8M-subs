how<00:03:43.480> those<00:03:43.720> two<00:03:43.930> could<00:03:44.140> be<00:03:44.290> in<00:03:44.410> collision

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
how those two could be in collision

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.949 
how those two could be in collision
course<00:03:45.340> in<00:03:45.489> pod<00:03:45.760> two<00:03:46.060> and<00:03:46.300> that<00:03:46.660> would<00:03:46.780> really

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
course in pod two and that would really

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.290 
course in pod two and that would really
compress<00:03:47.530> the<00:03:47.769> field<00:03:48.040> as<00:03:48.310> we<00:03:48.700> go<00:03:48.820> back<00:03:49.090> into
