joint between the drumstick and the

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.620 
joint between the drumstick and the
thigh<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:08.520> can<00:03:08.700> do<00:03:08.910> it<00:03:08.970> with<00:03:09.090> your<00:03:09.210> finger<00:03:09.600> you

thigh you can do it with your finger you
can<00:03:09.900> actually<00:03:10.110> feel<00:03:10.560> where<00:03:11.190> that<00:03:11.400> joint<00:03:11.580> is

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
can actually feel where that joint is

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.610 
can actually feel where that joint is
and<00:03:12.330> once<00:03:12.510> you've<00:03:12.660> got<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:12.870> just<00:03:13.140> take<00:03:13.590> the
