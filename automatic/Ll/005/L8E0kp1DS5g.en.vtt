00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
you know thinking about it for a while

you know thinking about it for a while
going<00:00:40.170> through<00:00:40.290> all<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.860> areas<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.520> bioshock

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
going through all the areas of bioshock

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.130 
going through all the areas of bioshock
infinite<00:00:42.239> which<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.540> amazing<00:00:42.899> game<00:00:45.140> going

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
infinite which is amazing game going

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.619 
infinite which is amazing game going
through<00:00:46.350> all<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.559> areas<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.160> know<00:00:47.610> in<00:00:47.910> which

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
through all the areas you know in which

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.049 
through all the areas you know in which
i<00:00:48.960> think<00:00:49.020> there's<00:00:49.469> room<00:00:49.770> for<00:00:49.829> DLC<00:00:50.610> within<00:00:50.969> the

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
i think there's room for DLC within the

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.389 
i think there's room for DLC within the
story<00:00:51.390> because<00:00:52.050> BioShock<00:00:52.530> Infinite<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.980> very

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
story because BioShock Infinite is very

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.810 
story because BioShock Infinite is very
story<00:00:53.760> heavy<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.180> let's<00:00:54.360> jump<00:00:54.629> right<00:00:54.719> into<00:00:55.020> it

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
story heavy so let's jump right into it

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.549

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
think there's room for some linear

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.789 
think there's room for some linear
shooting<00:01:59.640> because<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.899> gut<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.619> game

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
shooting because the gut the game

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.350 
shooting because the gut the game
playing<00:02:02.100> bioshock<00:02:02.369> infinite<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.850> really

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
playing bioshock infinite is really

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.990 
playing bioshock infinite is really
really<00:02:03.540> good<00:02:03.690> so<00:02:04.560> if<00:02:04.830> they<00:02:05.100> had<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.370> you<00:02:05.880> know

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
really good so if they had a you know

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.810 
really good so if they had a you know
short<00:02:06.750> like<00:02:06.990> four<00:02:07.320> or<00:02:07.410> five<00:02:07.470> hour<00:02:07.890> DLC<00:02:08.550> where

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
short like four or five hour DLC where

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.460 
short like four or five hour DLC where
you<00:02:08.970> fight<00:02:09.420> at<00:02:09.600> the<00:02:09.630> battle<00:02:09.990> at<00:02:10.110> Wounded<00:02:10.440> Knee

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
you fight at the battle at Wounded Knee

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.560 
you fight at the battle at Wounded Knee
I<00:02:10.830> think<00:02:11.520> that<00:02:11.550> would<00:02:11.700> be<00:02:11.760> really<00:02:11.850> cool<00:02:12.210> would

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
I think that would be really cool would

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.570 
I think that would be really cool would
be<00:02:12.720> linear<00:02:13.080> there's<00:02:13.440> no<00:02:13.560> way<00:02:13.920> they<00:02:14.130> really

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
be linear there's no way they really

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.920 
be linear there's no way they really
could<00:02:14.760> make<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:15.120> not<00:02:15.690> linear<00:02:16.170> um<00:02:17.150> so<00:02:18.150> in<00:02:18.780> that

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
could make it not linear um so in that

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.480 
could make it not linear um so in that
sense<00:02:19.260> it's<00:02:19.500> kind<00:02:19.680> of<00:02:19.740> branching<00:02:20.190> off<00:02:20.340> the

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
sense it's kind of branching off the

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.430 
sense it's kind of branching off the
idea<00:02:20.820> of<00:02:21.090> what<00:02:21.510> BioShock<00:02:21.960> Infinite<00:02:21.990> is<00:02:22.320> all

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
idea of what BioShock Infinite is all

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.120 
idea of what BioShock Infinite is all
about<00:02:22.650> being<00:02:22.920> like<00:02:23.310> nonlinear<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.030> mean<00:02:24.210> it<00:02:24.300> is

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
about being like nonlinear I mean it is

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.930 
about being like nonlinear I mean it is
whatever<00:02:26.130> that's<00:02:26.880> my<00:02:27.120> first<00:02:27.900> prediction<00:02:28.940> it's

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
whatever that's my first prediction it's

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.430 
whatever that's my first prediction it's
not<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.209> best<00:02:30.360> but<00:02:30.540> I<00:02:30.690> do<00:02:30.810> think<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.290> ban

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
not the best but I do think the ban

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.270 
not the best but I do think the ban
battle<00:02:32.040> at<00:02:32.130> wounded<00:02:32.459> knee<00:02:32.490> is<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.990> viable<00:02:34.280> DLC

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
battle at wounded knee is a viable DLC

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.330 
battle at wounded knee is a viable DLC
option<00:02:37.010> so<00:02:38.010> yeah<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:39.540> next<00:02:39.570> is<00:02:40.080> playing<00:02:40.980> as

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
option so yeah the next is playing as

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.640 
option so yeah the next is playing as
Booker<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.150> martyr<00:02:42.750> for<00:02:43.160> Fitzroy<00:02:44.160> um<00:02:44.510> now<00:02:45.650> for

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
Booker the martyr for Fitzroy um now for

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:47.930 
Booker the martyr for Fitzroy um now for
those<00:02:46.739> of<00:02:46.800> you<00:02:47.010> play<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.340> game<00:02:47.489> or<00:02:47.520> for<00:02:47.880> those

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
those of you play the game or for those

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.180 
those of you play the game or for those
of<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.300> haven't<00:02:48.930> I'll<00:02:49.020> just<00:02:49.200> go<00:02:49.860> over<00:02:49.980> it

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
of you haven't I'll just go over it

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.370 
of you haven't I'll just go over it
again<00:02:50.300> basically<00:02:51.300> the<00:02:51.690> game<00:02:51.930> you<00:02:52.110> know<00:02:52.200> has<00:02:52.350> a

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
again basically the game you know has a

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.320 
again basically the game you know has a
bunch<00:02:52.590> of<00:02:52.650> parallel<00:02:53.040> universes<00:02:53.070> and<00:02:53.850> in<00:02:54.060> one

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
bunch of parallel universes and in one

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.670 
bunch of parallel universes and in one
of<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.540> parts<00:02:54.840> of<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:54.959> game<00:02:55.170> you<00:02:55.320> go<00:02:55.470> through

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
of the parts of the game you go through

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.920 
of the parts of the game you go through
a<00:02:55.739> tear<00:02:56.040> into<00:02:56.610> this<00:02:56.790> new<00:02:57.030> parallel<00:02:57.480> universe

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
a tear into this new parallel universe

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.860 
a tear into this new parallel universe
and<00:02:58.200> in<00:02:59.070> that<00:02:59.130> universe<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:00.300> find<00:03:00.330> out<00:03:00.690> the

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
and in that universe you find out the

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.870 
and in that universe you find out the
the<00:03:01.290> booker<00:03:01.620> dewitt<00:03:01.739> of<00:03:02.040> that<00:03:02.190> universe<00:03:02.580> died

other booker dewitt from that universe
died<00:03:18.660> already<00:03:18.870> but<00:03:19.260> now<00:03:19.380> you're<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.860> booker

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
died already but now you're the booker

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.500

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
coming into this new universe and you

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:25.940 
coming into this new universe and you
know<00:03:24.900> everybody<00:03:25.170> thought<00:03:25.440> you<00:03:25.560> were<00:03:25.650> dead<00:03:25.769> now

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
know everybody thought you were dead now

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.250 
know everybody thought you were dead now
you're<00:03:26.070> like<00:03:26.220> hey<00:03:26.340> I'm<00:03:26.430> alive<00:03:26.640> but<00:03:27.049> we<00:03:28.049> never

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
you're like hey I'm alive but we never

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.800 
you're like hey I'm alive but we never
actually<00:03:28.620> found<00:03:29.070> out<00:03:29.340> what<00:03:29.790> happened<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.660> the

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
actually found out what happened to the

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.259 
actually found out what happened to the
old<00:03:31.019> Booker<00:03:31.830> DeWitt<00:03:32.040> who<00:03:32.220> died<00:03:32.640> fighting<00:03:33.060> for

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
old Booker DeWitt who died fighting for

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.210 
old Booker DeWitt who died fighting for
fitz<00:03:33.600> roy<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:33.989> was<00:03:34.110> considered<00:03:34.560> a<00:03:34.680> martyr<00:03:35.100> in

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
fitz roy and was considered a martyr in

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.250 
fitz roy and was considered a martyr in
a<00:03:35.280> hero<00:03:35.610> so<00:03:36.390> i<00:03:36.420> think<00:03:36.950> that<00:03:38.420> could<00:03:39.420> very<00:03:39.720> easily

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
a hero so i think that could very easily

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.060 
a hero so i think that could very easily
be<00:03:40.980> a<00:03:41.220> DLC<00:03:41.880> I<00:03:42.060> could<00:03:42.360> definitely<00:03:42.540> see<00:03:42.810> that

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
be a DLC I could definitely see that

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.500 
be a DLC I could definitely see that
because<00:03:44.070> that's<00:03:44.310> a<00:03:44.519> major<00:03:44.790> chunk<00:03:45.239> of<00:03:45.420> the

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
because that's a major chunk of the

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.140 
because that's a major chunk of the
story<00:03:45.780> they<00:03:46.019> just<00:03:46.230> left<00:03:46.500> out<00:03:46.739> I<00:03:47.040> mean<00:03:47.580> when<00:03:48.060> you

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
story they just left out I mean when you

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.729 
story they just left out I mean when you
think<00:03:48.180> about<00:03:48.450> it<00:03:48.750> like<00:03:48.900> that's<00:03:49.440> some<00:03:49.620> pretty

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
think about it like that's some pretty

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.890 
think about it like that's some pretty
interesting<00:03:50.070> stuff<00:03:50.310> how<00:03:50.730> did<00:03:51.000> Booker<00:03:51.480> even

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
interesting stuff how did Booker even

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.170

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.110 
and most importantly how did he die in
this<00:04:18.639> other<00:04:18.880> universe<00:04:19.590> so<00:04:20.590> that<00:04:20.829> uh<00:04:21.340> that<00:04:21.639> you

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
this other universe so that uh that you

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.629 
this other universe so that uh that you
know<00:04:22.240> would<00:04:22.900> easily<00:04:23.260> be<00:04:23.590> a<00:04:23.620> like<00:04:24.160> a<00:04:24.190> 10<00:04:24.460> hour

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
know would easily be a like a 10 hour

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.240 
know would easily be a like a 10 hour
DLC<00:04:25.270> as<00:04:25.419> well<00:04:25.630> because<00:04:25.900> you<00:04:26.020> could<00:04:26.230> still<00:04:26.620> have

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
DLC as well because you could still have

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.400 
DLC as well because you could still have
these<00:04:27.639> wide-open<00:04:27.970> levels<00:04:28.630> in<00:04:28.780> Columbia<00:04:29.200> like

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
these wide-open levels in Columbia like

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.800 
these wide-open levels in Columbia like
BioShock<00:04:29.950> Infinite<00:04:29.980> was<00:04:30.400> so<00:04:30.880> good<00:04:31.180> so<00:04:31.780> good

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
BioShock Infinite was so good so good

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.120 
BioShock Infinite was so good so good
for<00:04:32.169> you<00:04:32.320> know<00:04:32.440> you'd<00:04:32.590> still<00:04:32.800> have<00:04:32.830> that<00:04:32.950> open

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
for you know you'd still have that open

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.870 
for you know you'd still have that open
Columbia<00:04:33.760> environment<00:04:35.280> unlike<00:04:36.280> the<00:04:36.610> Battle

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
Columbia environment unlike the Battle

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.440 
Columbia environment unlike the Battle
of<00:04:36.940> Wounded<00:04:37.060> Knee<00:04:37.270> DLC<00:04:37.870> prediction<00:04:38.940> so<00:04:39.940> that

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
of Wounded Knee DLC prediction so that

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.180 
of Wounded Knee DLC prediction so that
seems<00:04:40.840> to<00:04:41.080> be<00:04:41.200> more<00:04:41.380> in<00:04:41.470> line<00:04:41.650> with<00:04:41.710> the<00:04:42.040> game

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
seems to be more in line with the game

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.730 
seems to be more in line with the game
it's<00:04:42.370> also<00:04:42.520> you<00:04:43.150> know<00:04:43.180> more<00:04:43.600> story<00:04:44.320> heavy<00:04:44.530> so

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
it's also you know more story heavy so

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.720 
it's also you know more story heavy so
that's<00:04:44.889> why<00:04:45.010> I<00:04:45.040> think<00:04:45.160> that's<00:04:45.400> more<00:04:45.580> of<00:04:45.639> a

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
that's why I think that's more of a

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.340 
that's why I think that's more of a
viable<00:04:46.090> DLC<00:04:46.510> option<00:04:46.840> than<00:04:46.990> the<00:04:47.050> Battle<00:04:47.320> of

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
viable DLC option than the Battle of

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.940 
viable DLC option than the Battle of
Wounded<00:04:47.470> Knee<00:04:48.120> and<00:04:49.120> then<00:04:49.300> my<00:04:50.020> last<00:04:50.380> prediction

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
Wounded Knee and then my last prediction

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.430 
Wounded Knee and then my last prediction
for<00:04:51.340> DLC<00:04:51.760> and<00:04:51.790> this<00:04:52.120> one<00:04:52.390> is<00:04:52.570> kind<00:04:52.960> of<00:04:53.169> pretty

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
for DLC and this one is kind of pretty

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.990 
for DLC and this one is kind of pretty
much<00:04:53.710> confirmed<00:04:54.570> um<00:04:56.340> everyone's<00:04:57.340> saying<00:04:57.700> this

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
much confirmed um everyone's saying this

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.180 
much confirmed um everyone's saying this
one<00:04:58.240> but<00:04:58.480> it<00:04:58.510> is<00:04:58.720> a<00:04:58.750> very<00:04:59.230> good<00:04:59.350> prediction<00:05:00.100> I

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
one but it is a very good prediction I

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.390 
one but it is a very good prediction I
think<00:05:00.430> this<00:05:00.550> is<00:05:00.669> very<00:05:01.530> logical<00:05:02.530> and<00:05:02.650> that<00:05:03.250> is

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
think this is very logical and that is

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.210 
think this is very logical and that is

gameplay<00:06:36.150> of<00:06:36.180> infinite<00:06:36.770> because<00:06:37.770> infinite

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.250 
gameplay of infinite because infinite

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.330

makes a game great so that's probably

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:03.320 
makes a game great so that's probably
your<00:07:01.110> best<00:07:01.349> bet<00:07:01.580> in<00:07:02.580> turn<00:07:02.759> if<00:07:02.969> you're<00:07:03.210> if

videos<00:07:33.449> and<00:07:33.629> I<00:07:33.690> really<00:07:34.080> don't<00:07:34.409> agree<00:07:35.129> with

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:35.250 
videos and I really don't agree with

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:36.980 
videos and I really don't agree with
most<00:07:35.580> of<00:07:35.759> the<00:07:35.819> stuff<00:07:36.090> I<00:07:36.300> think<00:07:36.509> this<00:07:36.659> is<00:07:36.810> really

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:36.990 
most of the stuff I think this is really

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:38.149 
most of the stuff I think this is really
the<00:07:37.199> stuff<00:07:37.409> they're<00:07:37.560> going<00:07:37.680> to<00:07:37.740> focus<00:07:37.919> on

00:07:38.149 --> 00:07:38.159 
the stuff they're going to focus on

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:41.749 
the stuff they're going to focus on
because<00:07:38.629> the<00:07:39.629> ending<00:07:40.080> the<00:07:41.069> beginning<00:07:41.639> and

00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 
because the ending the beginning and

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:43.760 
because the ending the beginning and
ending<00:07:42.060> are<00:07:42.180> very<00:07:42.479> flushed<00:07:42.839> out<00:07:43.050> of<00:07:43.259> bioshock

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:43.770 
ending are very flushed out of bioshock

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:45.649 
ending are very flushed out of bioshock
infinite<00:07:44.069> but<00:07:44.400> the<00:07:44.520> stuff<00:07:44.789> in<00:07:44.969> between<00:07:45.150> is

00:07:45.649 --> 00:07:45.659 
infinite but the stuff in between is

00:07:45.659 --> 00:07:47.570 
infinite but the stuff in between is
very<00:07:45.900> vague<00:07:46.199> and<00:07:46.560> I<00:07:46.620> think<00:07:46.860> it's<00:07:47.039> vague<00:07:47.250> for<00:07:47.550> a

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:47.580 
very vague and I think it's vague for a

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:52.279 
very vague and I think it's vague for a
