00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
it's taking forever to flow down you can

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.400 
it's taking forever to flow down you can
hear<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.150> squeak<00:02:57.450> squeak-squeak<00:02:59.870> so<00:03:00.870> I'm

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
channel going mm going off my lines

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.129 
channel going mm going off my lines
that's<00:04:47.150> okay<00:04:47.830> and<00:04:48.830> then<00:04:49.010> just<00:04:49.220> drop<00:04:49.460> it<00:04:49.580> off

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
there's my first channel for my when

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.390 
there's my first channel for my when
it's<00:04:56.060> going<00:04:56.210> to<00:04:56.270> become<00:04:56.510> a<00:04:56.690> window<00:04:57.050> sticky<00:04:57.400> now

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
it's going to become a window sticky now

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.810 
it's going to become a window sticky now
how<00:04:58.610> I<00:04:58.639> do<00:04:58.820> these<00:04:59.120> big<00:04:59.539> one<00:04:59.750> is<00:05:00.010> I<00:05:01.010> go<00:05:01.610> ahead<00:05:01.699> and

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
how I do these big one is I go ahead and

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.330 
how I do these big one is I go ahead and
I<00:05:01.970> draw<00:05:02.240> on<00:05:02.539> the<00:05:02.720> glass<00:05:02.930> like<00:05:03.380> I<00:05:03.590> have<00:05:03.830> here<00:05:04.099> and

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
I draw on the glass like I have here and

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.300 
I draw on the glass like I have here and
then<00:05:04.940> I<00:05:05.240> take<00:05:05.479> my<00:05:05.510> liquid<00:05:06.050> letting<00:05:06.530> as<00:05:06.680> I<00:05:07.099> have

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
then I take my liquid letting as I have

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.000 
then I take my liquid letting as I have
here<00:05:07.639> I<00:05:07.930> take<00:05:08.930> the<00:05:09.080> gallery<00:05:09.410> glass<00:05:09.710> liquid

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
here I take the gallery glass liquid

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.990 
here I take the gallery glass liquid
letting<00:05:10.460> and<00:05:10.699> I<00:05:11.690> drop<00:05:12.229> it<00:05:12.380> down<00:05:12.560> on<00:05:12.860> the<00:05:13.729> glass

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
letting and I drop it down on the glass

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.990 
letting and I drop it down on the glass
and<00:05:14.449> then<00:05:15.110> I<00:05:15.410> peel<00:05:15.740> it<00:05:15.919> up<00:05:16.010> when<00:05:16.789> it's

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
and then I peel it up when it's

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.279 
and then I peel it up when it's
completely<00:05:17.780> hard

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
completely hard

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:21.010 
completely hard
it<00:05:18.440> usually<00:05:18.650> takes<00:05:18.860> like<00:05:19.330> 24<00:05:20.330> hours<00:05:20.599> to<00:05:20.780> 48
