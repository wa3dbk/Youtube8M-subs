00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.650
 here in my hands time is back 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.350
 inspired where it presents the following 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.110
 Defects Locking It Locks It Can 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.620
 to go to the vote his own can lose 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.320
 the CD's adherence to the media it can 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.300
 decrease the rotation of life because it is the 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.100
 stepper motor it has the coils of 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.410
 here where any of them 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.660
 altered the rotation of it then 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.760
 it is discarded for 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.250
 work has no way of correcting its 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.009
 flat this shorter here is to pass from 90 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.660
 thousand to where your nearest plate have 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.940
 other models here with the flash more 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.670
 elongated and only you can observe 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.100
 which is the reverse position to 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.469
 I'll have to scrape the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.250
 placing the terminal position of this 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.120
 model here 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.000
 this one is a model 70000 the exchange 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.030
 all of them from the same defect then the 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.489
 replacement has to be in the piece at the 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.550
 she can present in urns on the side 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.890
 Right where you left side 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.890
 school where you may have 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.010
 learn to drive is the rubbers can 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.799
 resection where they can download discuss the 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.290
 position of the lens to read 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.409
 so any wind and maintenance always 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.030
 It's by observation, and the champion I 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.220
 I explained the club may lose 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.330
 grip where the cds stay does not hang 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.119
 have work on it 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.060
 then you can not replace the camp with 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.189
 the old players then this is only 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.979
 replace the engine completely 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.200
 okay go here another piece here is the 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.320
 engine is where it has the 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.360
 the axis is infinite that makes the 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.450
 movement of the unit forward to 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.820
 together with another piece the piece in a 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.369
 steel blade here she has one piece 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.509
 plastic at the end which are two teeth 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:54.000
 where you lean on it is making the 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.369
 difference and do is to run to unity 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.110
 backwards now you have the 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.490
 defects that happens in cleaning you 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.890
 you have to clean over this 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.810
 There's a lot of teeth in this mud. 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.700
 here as the axis itself 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.560
 I already explained in the previous video what 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.340
 happens to you physically happening 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.289
 this defect 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.280
 so you have to do a maintenance 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.440
 Preventive before taking to replace 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.110
 the blade you can do the 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.600
 adjusting gabaritando she created a template 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.630
 where adjustments could be made to create 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.910
 grip on this, then you have 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.400
 We always observe these details before 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.080
 replace part to drive I think 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.670
 is this fixed goal 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.060
 you have to make a screw adjustment 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.800
 calmly not damaging the other 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.050
 Plastic unit will not dry bp 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.650
 on the unit by pressing too hard this 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.959
 Score 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.320
 the optical drive is defective. 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.630
 reading that is low on focus or none 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.600
 focus but many units presents 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.340
 focus and yourself so she is 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.620
 damaged how you detect 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.709
 having those equipments that I spoke 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.080
 the parts with the engine and has expired and other 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.530
 for replacement before changing 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.040
 it 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.670
 is this point here that would be the 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.709
 unity 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.600
 you have to observe where when you 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.519
 purchase the new unit to remove it. 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.510
 because if you do not take it out it will not 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.459
 to read 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.319
 You have to watch this, I'll go. 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.600
 show that there is little new unit 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.880
 observe the difference between being closed 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.910
 and open but rather pass the ferguson 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.310
 From here he will only fall and be ready 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.320
 quickly she gets released to you 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.600
 make use of it going to 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.489
 next unit 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.590
 at this point zero time you go there I 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.150
 I commented in the previous union 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.160
 so here's just you apply the iron 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.430
 solder does not need to touch the 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.519
 flat tape here in this thesis is because she 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.380
 can melt will come back to stay 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.450
 evident that this one then ready 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.600
 released from the unit to be used 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.900
 It's okay to spend nothing on her. 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.790
 there as I showed in the previous video 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.890
 so you can apply this 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.130
 usually if you do not remove this seal 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.390
 it will not work 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.220
 something else that I presented or 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.750
 following the defect that can lead to 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.370
 by the technician himself 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.140
 You see flashes of that engine that is 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.590
 different from the previous engine I showed 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:15.920
 yesterday the coach will take the table and pull 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.820
 From time to time, she's going to drop that party. 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.190
 it breaks 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.109
 dani staying then you have to have 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.370
 care at that point is then in 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.510
 moment that you can mess with this 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.810
 the flash tape that connects to the 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.630
 my 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.070
 with the unit you also have to 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.620
 observe the following your body may 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.110
 undergo verified unit technique 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.169
 lock something else to drive motion 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.930
 cent is continuous can break this flash 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.310
 in the middle so often invisible 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.750
 other times not 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.030
 You always have to have a freight. 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.580
 substitute for placing other 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.169
 models also where you will deal in the 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.230
 day-to-day maintenance you go 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:56.830
 come up with this then it is the question of 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.380
 just opposite the same physical damage 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:03.080
 presenting obviously not read 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:06.650
 can not read the game 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:09.889
 so let's now put more 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:13.700
 some information is about the fan 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:16.070
 which can cause it may locking 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.660
 cause the image to freeze then 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.389
 You have to watch if it will be 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.280
 locked by dirt or is defective 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:23.960
 even then I know why you will see 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.240
 the function of cooling the 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.330
 bg processor and also the part 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.460
 internal memory of the video game if 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.260
 working obviously will entail 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.419
 this freezing of the image is only 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.020
 do the preventive cleaning and finished 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:38.510
 same 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:41.330
 but there are also screws here 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.340
 have to be the originals if they 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.690
 you do not put this original project 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.000
 Are you going to have trouble? 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.919
 I will start to show myself 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.560
 for you other words that can not 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:54.830
 then be these three screws here have 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:57.680
 that being the same is if their pattern is already 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.510
 the first one is marked to lock 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:03.350
 of the axis it makes works with the 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:04.850
 axle clamps that make the table which 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.370
 is here is here is this engine 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.990
 largest green ant and another china is 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.300
 which holds the unit 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.940
 so it's just you and it's trying to fix 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.919
 Somewhere not to be missed here. 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.990
 finishes another maintenance class 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:19.910
 where you have to present some pieces and 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.370
 their main defects 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.350
 now it's just you vote it all in 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:28.000
 practice thanks to the acquisition of 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.000
 material and I hope you like it
