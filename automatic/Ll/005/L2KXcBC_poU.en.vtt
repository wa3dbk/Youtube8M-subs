there<00:03:39.350> is<00:03:39.380> any<00:03:39.620> way<00:03:39.830> to<00:03:39.860> just<00:03:40.190> leave<00:03:40.430> a<00:03:40.460> level

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
there is any way to just leave a level

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.940 
there is any way to just leave a level
that<00:03:41.210> we've<00:03:41.390> already<00:03:41.570> completed<00:03:42.140> but<00:03:42.470> i<00:03:42.650> guess

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
that we've already completed but i guess

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.870 
that we've already completed but i guess
not<00:03:43.420> at<00:03:44.420> least<00:03:44.660> we<00:03:44.900> have<00:03:45.110> to<00:03:46.010> potion<00:03:46.490> bottles

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
not at least we have to potion bottles

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:56.440 
not at least we have to potion bottles
they're<00:03:54.220> just<00:03:55.220> really<00:03:55.400> careful<00:03:55.910> oh<00:03:56.090> well

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
they're just really careful oh well

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.500 
they're just really careful oh well
maybe<00:03:56.690> I'll<00:03:56.900> be<00:03:57.050> able<00:03:57.140> to<00:03:57.290> find<00:03:57.850> it<00:03:58.850> some<00:03:59.240> kind

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
maybe I'll be able to find it some kind

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.980 
maybe I'll be able to find it some kind
of<00:03:59.600> food<00:03:59.960> so<00:04:00.260> can<00:04:00.500> get<00:04:00.710> out<00:04:00.830> of<00:04:00.860> here<00:04:01.070> alive<00:04:04.990> a

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
of food so can get out of here alive a
