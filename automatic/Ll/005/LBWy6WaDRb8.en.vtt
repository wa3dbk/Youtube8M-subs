tactics<00:03:24.370> at<00:03:24.549> that<00:03:24.850> moment<00:03:25.329> that<00:03:25.480> you<00:03:25.690> just

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
tactics at that moment that you just

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.160 
tactics at that moment that you just
can't<00:03:26.260> counter<00:03:26.739> but<00:03:27.430> I<00:03:27.459> mean<00:03:27.760> it's<00:03:28.510> ways<00:03:28.780> to

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
can't counter but I mean it's ways to

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.979 
can't counter but I mean it's ways to
just<00:03:29.470> survive<00:03:29.890> and<00:03:29.950> use<00:03:30.489> the<00:03:30.700> clock<00:03:31.030> and<00:03:31.329> do

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
just survive and use the clock and do

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.860 
just survive and use the clock and do
things<00:03:32.319> but<00:03:32.799> I<00:03:33.100> see<00:03:34.000> a<00:03:34.030> lot<00:03:34.269> of<00:03:34.299> sands<00:03:34.630> of
