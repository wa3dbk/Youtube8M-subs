well<00:00:00.599> after<00:00:00.930> you<00:00:01.020> take<00:00:01.199> your<00:00:01.439> your<00:00:01.920> cleaner

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
well after you take your your cleaner

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.249 
well after you take your your cleaner
apart<00:00:02.700> getting<00:00:03.300> the<00:00:03.389> lower<00:00:03.600> truck<00:00:03.929> assembly

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
apart getting the lower truck assembly

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.400 
apart getting the lower truck assembly
off<00:00:04.650> of<00:00:04.950> it<00:00:05.069> like<00:00:05.220> we've<00:00:05.400> done<00:00:05.609> here<00:00:06.410> sometimes

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
off of it like we've done here sometimes

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.140 
off of it like we've done here sometimes
it<00:00:07.500> becomes<00:00:07.589> necessary<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:08.280> replace<00:00:08.610> these

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
it becomes necessary to replace these

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.629 
it becomes necessary to replace these
these<00:00:09.450> are<00:00:09.599> called<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:09.870> pods<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:10.590> also<00:00:11.429> if<00:00:11.519> we

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
these are called the pods and also if we

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.039 
these are called the pods and also if we
need<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:11.820> replace<00:00:12.179> any<00:00:12.389> of<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.599> other<00:00:12.809> pieces

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
need to replace any of the other pieces

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.890 
need to replace any of the other pieces
like<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.590> a-frame<00:00:14.130> here<00:00:14.610> this<00:00:15.420> is<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.690> first

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
like the a-frame here this is the first

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.990 
like the a-frame here this is the first
step<00:00:16.139> so<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.770> way<00:00:16.890> we<00:00:17.010> do<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:17.430> using<00:00:17.940> a

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
step so the way we do that is using a

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.540 
step so the way we do that is using a
small<00:00:18.240> screwdriver<00:00:18.570> we<00:00:19.410> just<00:00:19.619> sort<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:19.890> pop

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
small screwdriver we just sort of pop

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.470 
small screwdriver we just sort of pop
off<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.150> pod<00:00:21.330> plugs<00:00:25.760> get<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.910> fingers<00:00:27.330> in

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
off the pod plugs get the fingers in

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.150 
off the pod plugs get the fingers in
there<00:00:27.689> work<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.050> back<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.410> forth<00:00:28.650> there<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:29.039> is

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
there work it back and forth there it is

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.339 
there work it back and forth there it is
all<00:00:30.119> right<00:00:30.210> at<00:00:30.359> this<00:00:30.480> time<00:00:30.720> it's<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.929> good<00:00:31.050> idea

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
all right at this time it's a good idea

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.680 
all right at this time it's a good idea
to<00:00:31.560> take<00:00:31.800> off<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.130> wing<00:00:32.279> assemblies<00:00:32.820> there's

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
to take off the wing assemblies there's

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.600 
to take off the wing assemblies there's
a<00:00:33.750> little<00:00:34.020> notch<00:00:34.559> here<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:35.190> want<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.370> move<00:00:35.520> it

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
a little notch here you want to move it

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.750 
a little notch here you want to move it
up<00:00:35.700> on<00:00:35.880> one<00:00:36.059> side<00:00:36.360> OOP<00:00:36.840> OOP<00:00:37.079> okay<00:00:37.620> if<00:00:38.399> those<00:00:38.579> are

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
up on one side OOP OOP okay if those are

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.819 
up on one side OOP OOP okay if those are
broken<00:00:39.149> obviously<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:40.110> want<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.500> replace

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
broken obviously you want to replace

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.750 
broken obviously you want to replace
those<00:00:41.160> all<00:00:41.940> right<00:00:42.059> here<00:00:42.750> inside<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.100> quarter

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
those all right here inside is a quarter

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.450 
those all right here inside is a quarter
inch<00:00:45.110> quarter<00:00:46.110> inch<00:00:46.260> nut<00:00:46.530> it's<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.219> screw

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
inch quarter inch nut it's a screw

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.860 
inch quarter inch nut it's a screw
rather<00:00:47.670> but<00:00:48.000> use<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.300> quarter<00:00:48.570> inch<00:00:48.660> nut

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
rather but use the quarter inch nut

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.770 
rather but use the quarter inch nut

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
driver here mount handily once we remove

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.240 
driver here mount handily once we remove
this<00:00:51.930> bit<00:00:52.170> that's<00:00:52.649> where<00:00:52.800> we're<00:00:52.890> ending<00:00:52.980> up

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
this bit that's where we're ending up

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.459 
this bit that's where we're ending up
with<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.910> I'm<00:00:54.480> gonna<00:00:54.600> put<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.870> right<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.140> here

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
with and I'm gonna put it right in here

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.229 
with and I'm gonna put it right in here
holding<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.489> firmly<00:00:57.500> and<00:00:58.730> backs<00:00:59.730> right<00:01:00.059> out

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
holding it firmly and backs right out

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.320 
holding it firmly and backs right out
when<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.600> do<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.050> other<00:01:01.199> side<00:01:05.330> all

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
when I do that to the other side all

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.899 
when I do that to the other side all
right<00:01:06.600> also<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.590> little<00:01:07.799> washer<00:01:08.250> keep<00:01:08.729> your<00:01:08.880> eye

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
right also a little washer keep your eye

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.080 
right also a little washer keep your eye
on<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:10.040> now<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.070> lot<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.549> things<00:01:11.729> do<00:01:11.909> come

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
on that now a lot of the things do come

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.550 
on that now a lot of the things do come
room<00:01:12.299> with<00:01:12.450> replacement<00:01:12.840> stainless<00:01:13.380> steel

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
room with replacement stainless steel

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.460 
room with replacement stainless steel
hardware<00:01:14.010> that's<00:01:14.430> also<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.729> good<00:01:14.909> benefit<00:01:15.299> now

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
hardware that's also a good benefit now

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.320 
hardware that's also a good benefit now
in<00:01:16.470> theory<00:01:16.950> these<00:01:17.189> things<00:01:17.490> just<00:01:17.729> pop<00:01:17.850> right

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
in theory these things just pop right

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.420 
in theory these things just pop right
off<00:01:18.390> I'm<00:01:19.229> here<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.470> tell<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:19.890> reality

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
off I'm here to tell you in reality

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.580 
off I'm here to tell you in reality
that's<00:01:20.939> not<00:01:21.119> always<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.570> way<00:01:21.689> be<00:01:21.990> careful<00:01:22.470> so

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
that's not always the way be careful so

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.560 
that's not always the way be careful so
you<00:01:22.650> don't<00:01:22.740> break<00:01:23.040> them<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.700> usually<00:01:24.150> use<00:01:24.540> a

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
you don't break them I usually use a

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.510 
you don't break them I usually use a
screwdriver<00:01:24.960> or<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.799> one<00:01:26.009> that's<00:01:26.189> slightly

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
screwdriver or is one that's slightly

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.880 
screwdriver or is one that's slightly
bigger<00:01:26.939> than<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.720> use<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.259> as<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.409> gentle

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
bigger than this and use it as a gentle

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.010 
bigger than this and use it as a gentle
wedge<00:01:29.189> okay<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:30.570> you're<00:01:30.659> putting<00:01:30.869> pressure

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
wedge okay so you're putting pressure

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.710 
wedge okay so you're putting pressure
right<00:01:31.530> over<00:01:31.950> here<00:01:32.400> as<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.610> cam<00:01:33.210> goes<00:01:33.450> through

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
right over here as the cam goes through

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.679 
right over here as the cam goes through
the<00:01:33.840> a-frame<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.500> just<00:01:35.100> sort<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.520> pushing<00:01:36.450> it

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
the a-frame and just sort of pushing it

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:43.429 
the a-frame and just sort of pushing it
off<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.409> see<00:01:37.700> on<00:01:38.700> both<00:01:39.030> sides<00:01:39.329> here<00:01:42.200> they<00:01:43.200> pop

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
off you see on both sides here they pop

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.830 
off you see on both sides here they pop
right<00:01:43.470> off<00:01:43.740> on<00:01:44.399> inspection<00:01:45.060> what<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.540> want<00:01:45.750> to

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
right off on inspection what you want to

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.100 
right off on inspection what you want to
make<00:01:45.960> sure<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.770> these<00:01:47.159> are<00:01:47.430> perfectly

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
make sure is that these are perfectly

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.109 
make sure is that these are perfectly
square<00:01:49.110> like<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:49.350> when<00:01:50.189> they<00:01:50.340> start<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.759> wear

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
square like this when they start to wear

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.960 
square like this when they start to wear
they'll<00:01:51.570> bow<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.740> what<00:01:53.159> will<00:01:53.250> happen<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.759> is

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
they'll bow and what will happen is is

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.020 
they'll bow and what will happen is is
that<00:01:54.570> while<00:01:54.810> you're<00:01:54.990> holding<00:01:55.170> this<00:01:55.759> all<00:01:56.759> right

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
that while you're holding this all right

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.050 
that while you're holding this all right
