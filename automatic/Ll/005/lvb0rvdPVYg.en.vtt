00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello today I have a very, very, very 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.109
 delicious summer salad in front of me 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.580
 scary happy to do in the summer or 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.269
 just when I'm invited to one 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.340
 cookout 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.630
 it tastes delicious too 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.370
 People do not really have a big one 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.470
 I have lost my lenses over and over again 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.029
 seen that even people who say the 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.410
 Lenses are not my thing at the end 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.390
 loved this salad because he 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.220
 really special is through the 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.900
 combination just so delicious and you 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.130
 can make him vegan and vegetarian 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.349
 But you can also new things about it 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.910
 Add as you wish I'll show you today 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.669
 how to set the foundation for this 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.980
 Salad is the first sentence in the beginning 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.120
 always videos in my head 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.969
 we need 200 grams of red lentils two 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.180
 tomatoes two to three were left 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.770
 onions have three tablespoons vinegar i have 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.739
 here at sami economists just me 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.270
 a teaspoon tastes better 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.329
 obviously have a tablespoon here 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.030
 I strapped it in time 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.280
 eight tablespoons of olive oil 1 bunch of arugula 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.050
 I have a box of rucola here because of it 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.199
 never be enough rucola 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.790
 pepper salt and sugar we catch 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.710
 with the marinade that really quite 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.420
 we just mix it up 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.530
 balsamic or I eat whatever 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.530
 he uses with the sense 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.289
 time to do so 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:28.100
 Added to that was oil and we mix 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:28.100
 everything 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.240
 Your red lenses were the best way to do that 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.070
 as it stands on the pack I had to 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.840
 to cool my exactly ten minutes of cooking 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:52.230
 let and now comes the tomatoes 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:52.230
 the spring onions and rucola 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.909
 add marinade and mix 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.899
 The whole thing is quiet 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.009
 a little bit of flavor 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.959
 can develop 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.060
 this combination has the lenses with the 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.430
 juicy tomatoes and the spicy arugula 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.709
 At the sourish of the marinade is like that 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:21.900
 delicious and the whole is not alien 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:23.430
 powder potential and thus is the salad 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.080
 and you can do it perfectly 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.390
 The prepared one really tastes very good 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.890
 very good and I have very rare 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.840
 experienced that someone did not like him 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.230
 have suffered an awful lot of good 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.790
 substances for you potassium calcium magnesium 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.540
 Protein carbohydrates are many good ones 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.549
 things in it 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.560
 The buyers say it is 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.910
 Actually on a healthy salad though 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.380
 you still have a little extra 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.360
 I can prepare you for that 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.799
 recommend goat cheese over it 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.870
 he traded on the giant before 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.130
 a little bit to soft and the 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.080
 give users if you necessarily 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.000
 meat to wanted the goat cheese or 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.950
 wrapped with spectrum must also be very 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.019
 many people I love to eat the 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.340
 sack just with soft goat cheese 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.010
 and I like it very much 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.600
 but he also tastes without the 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.310
 doll out the salad and leave me 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.810
 know if you liked it fits well 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.250
 but i have a wonderful day 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.760
 and if you like we are on 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.760
 Friday 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:23.700
 I do not know you can help 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.959
 and then you can do it better too 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.250
 concentrate if you have such a video 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.260
 does not turn true 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.319
 how it looks from probably not with 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.280
 trifles then will ne in boudry 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.690
 maybe better but you have to do that 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.660
 she had driven between the 10th 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.460
 the whole video over 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.400
 all for his benefit not true 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.350
 simple survival versus what happens between 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.040
 the teeth have the problems of a 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.040
 millions
