nine<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.840> think<00:01:28.320> TSM<00:01:28.770> bouncing<00:01:29.340> back<00:01:29.579> from<00:01:30.270> a

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
nine I think TSM bouncing back from a

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.510 
nine I think TSM bouncing back from a
really<00:01:30.869> poor<00:01:31.170> performance<00:01:31.770> they<00:01:31.920> had<00:01:32.070> at<00:01:32.189> IM

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
San Jose and I do think they did a fair

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.850 
San Jose and I do think they did a fair
bit<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.420> self-reflection<00:01:36.930> after<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.680> know

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
bit of self-reflection after that I know

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.069

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610

prepared for cloud nine it seemed like

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.730

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.660 
today we hadn't seen before the
substitutes<00:02:31.650> really<00:02:31.950> stepping<00:02:32.220> up<00:02:32.430> had

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670

son I don't do it yeah it's faith in is
good<00:02:41.490> and<00:02:41.640> I<00:02:41.790> thought<00:02:42.090> that<00:02:42.150> was<00:02:42.450> really<00:02:42.780> just

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.720 
good and I thought that was really just
a<00:02:43.140> bold<00:02:43.410> move<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:43.980> paid<00:02:44.130> off<00:02:44.160> and<00:02:44.550> he

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
a bold move and it paid off and he

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:45.890 
a bold move and it paid off and he
