and this week is one of those times
because<00:00:46.410> our<00:00:46.559> planet<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.190> going<00:00:47.610> to

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
because our planet is going to

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.299 
because our planet is going to

eclipse<00:00:50.489> happens<00:00:51.300> when<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.539> moon<00:00:51.690> gets<00:00:51.930> right

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
eclipse happens when the moon gets right

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.560 
eclipse happens when the moon gets right
smack-dab<00:00:52.710> between<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.399> Sun<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.670> Earth<00:00:53.969> when

smack-dab between the Sun and Earth when

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.330 
smack-dab between the Sun and Earth when
the<00:00:54.660> moon<00:00:54.809> does<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.530> blocks<00:00:55.860> out<00:00:56.070> some<00:00:56.250> of

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
the moon does this it blocks out some of

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.400 
the moon does this it blocks out some of
the<00:00:56.399> sun's<00:00:56.699> light<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.270> casts<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.780> gigantic

very<00:01:00.449> long<00:01:00.690> just<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.230> few<00:01:01.260> minutes<00:01:01.710> really<00:01:01.829> but

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
very long just a few minutes really but

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.009 
very long just a few minutes really but
when<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.550> moon<00:01:02.730> blocks<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.420> light<00:01:03.449> from<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
when the moon blocks the light from the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.859 
when the moon blocks the light from the
Sun<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.890> can<00:01:05.129> make<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.549> sky<00:01:05.820> appear<00:01:06.240> as<00:01:06.390> dark

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
Sun it can make the sky appear as dark

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.440 
Sun it can make the sky appear as dark
as<00:01:07.170> night<00:01:07.200> even<00:01:08.130> though<00:01:08.310> it's<00:01:08.610> still<00:01:08.880> daytime

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
as night even though it's still daytime

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.050 
as night even though it's still daytime
now<00:01:09.900> not<00:01:10.110> all<00:01:10.140> eclipses<00:01:10.950> are<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.159> same<00:01:11.430> they

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
now not all eclipses are the same they

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.640 
now not all eclipses are the same they
can<00:01:12.210> look<00:01:12.360> different<00:01:12.570> depending<00:01:13.229> where<00:01:13.500> on

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
can look different depending where on

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.469 
can look different depending where on
earth<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:14.040> are<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.580> where<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.970> moon<00:01:15.150> shadow

earth you are and where the moon shadow

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.440 
earth you are and where the moon shadow
is<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:16.140> total<00:01:17.009> solar<00:01:17.250> eclipse<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.880> when<00:01:18.060> from

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
is a total solar eclipse is when from

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.940 
is a total solar eclipse is when from
where<00:01:18.689> you're<00:01:18.960> watching<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.740> moon

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
where you're watching the moon

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.310 
where you're watching the moon
completely<00:01:20.189> covers<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.330> Sun<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.780> sky<00:01:22.080> and

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
completely covers the Sun in the sky and

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.560 
completely covers the Sun in the sky and
then<00:01:22.830> there's<00:01:23.009> also<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.670> partial<00:01:24.360> solar

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
then there's also the partial solar

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.719 
then there's also the partial solar
eclipse<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:25.200> when<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.799> moon<00:01:25.920> passes<00:01:26.369> over

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
eclipse is when the moon passes over

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.490 
eclipse is when the moon passes over
just<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.030> little<00:01:27.060> bit<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.720> Sun<00:01:27.900> when<00:01:28.259> this

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
just a little bit of the Sun when this

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.350 
just a little bit of the Sun when this
kind<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.890> eclipse<00:01:29.189> happens<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.850> Sun<00:01:30.090> looks

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
kind of eclipse happens the Sun looks

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.179 
kind of eclipse happens the Sun looks
like<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.570> little<00:01:30.900> chunk<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.320> missing<00:01:31.710> like<00:01:32.040> a

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
like a little chunk is missing like a

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.950 
like a little chunk is missing like a
cookie<00:01:32.640> with<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.850> big<00:01:33.090> bite<00:01:33.270> taken<00:01:33.570> out<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.810> it

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
cookie with a big bite taken out of it

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.780 
cookie with a big bite taken out of it
now<00:01:34.259> it's<00:01:34.409> not<00:01:34.470> very<00:01:34.799> often<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.549> Sun

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
now it's not very often that the Sun

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.359 
now it's not very often that the Sun
Moon<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.840> earth<00:01:36.990> all<00:01:37.290> line<00:01:37.710> up<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.009> just

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
Moon and the earth all line up and just

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.280 
Moon and the earth all line up and just
the<00:01:38.490> right<00:01:38.610> way<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.820> create<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.329> solar<00:01:39.689> eclipse

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
the right way to create a solar eclipse

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.870 
the right way to create a solar eclipse
but<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.619> next<00:01:40.950> one<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.130> going<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.490> happen<00:01:41.759> on

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
but the next one is going to happen on

look like a little bite has been taken
out<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.270> Sun

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
out of the Sun

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.790 
out of the Sun
as<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.240> minutes<00:02:13.510> pass<00:02:13.780> that<00:02:14.350> bite<00:02:14.530> will<00:02:14.650> get

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
as the minutes pass that bite will get

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.770 
as the minutes pass that bite will get
smaller<00:02:15.160> and<00:02:15.580> smaller<00:02:15.910> until<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.420> Sun<00:02:16.630> is

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
smaller and smaller until the Sun is

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.150 
smaller and smaller until the Sun is
back<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.290> its<00:02:17.320> old<00:02:17.560> self<00:02:17.740> again

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
back to its old self again

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.410 
back to its old self again
now<00:02:18.250> it's<00:02:18.430> important<00:02:18.850> to<00:02:18.940> remember<00:02:19.150> you

now it's important to remember you

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.570 
now it's important to remember you
should<00:02:19.480> never<00:02:19.930> try<00:02:20.470> to<00:02:20.500> look<00:02:20.830> directly<00:02:21.070> at<00:02:21.310> an

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
should never try to look directly at an

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.250 
should never try to look directly at an
eclipse<00:02:21.850> because<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.660> rays<00:02:22.870> from<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.170> Sun

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
eclipse because the rays from the Sun

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.770 
eclipse because the rays from the Sun
can<00:02:23.650> really<00:02:23.950> damage<00:02:24.190> your<00:02:24.430> eyes<00:02:24.730> even<00:02:25.300> when

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
can really damage your eyes even when

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.450 
can really damage your eyes even when
it's<00:02:25.900> partially<00:02:26.350> covered<00:02:26.650> up<00:02:26.800> so<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.250> next

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
it's partially covered up so the next

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.010 
it's partially covered up so the next
time<00:02:27.640> you<00:02:27.790> go<00:02:27.940> outside<00:02:28.210> during<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.510> day<00:02:28.570> see

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
time you go outside during the day see

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.480 
time you go outside during the day see
if<00:02:29.110> you<00:02:29.170> can<00:02:29.320> find<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.620> moon<00:02:29.800> what<00:02:30.250> does<00:02:30.370> it

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
if you can find the moon what does it

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.220 
if you can find the moon what does it
look<00:02:30.640> like<00:02:30.850> we'll<00:02:31.480> be<00:02:31.510> keeping<00:02:31.870> an<00:02:31.960> eye<00:02:32.080> out

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
look like we'll be keeping an eye out

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:43.500 
look like we'll be keeping an eye out
for<00:02:32.260> it<00:02:32.500> too<00:02:32.710> here<00:02:33.130> at<00:02:33.220> scishow<00:02:33.430> kids
