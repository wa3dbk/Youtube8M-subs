for the environment and I'll tell you

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.870 
for the environment and I'll tell you
how<00:01:03.719> if<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.289> get<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.439> two-inch<00:01:04.949> rain<00:01:05.249> and<00:01:05.549> let's

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
how if you get a two-inch rain and let's

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.819 
how if you get a two-inch rain and let's
say<00:01:06.090> you've<00:01:06.299> got<00:01:06.329> ground<00:01:07.259> that's<00:01:07.499> a<00:01:07.590> hundred

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:07.829 
say you've got ground that's a hundred

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:10.190 
say you've got ground that's a hundred
percent<00:01:07.999> saturated<00:01:08.999> where<00:01:09.479> does<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.689> rain

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
percent saturated where does that rain

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.709 
percent saturated where does that rain
go<00:01:10.649> to<00:01:10.709> well<00:01:11.429> it's<00:01:11.670> going<00:01:11.819> to<00:01:11.880> runoff<00:01:12.240> if<00:01:12.569> it

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:12.719 
go to well it's going to runoff if it

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:14.359 
go to well it's going to runoff if it
can't<00:01:12.899> soak<00:01:13.170> into<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.499> ground<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:14.039> when<00:01:14.280> it

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
can't soak into the ground and when it

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.609 
can't soak into the ground and when it
runs<00:01:14.490> off<00:01:14.759> it<00:01:14.969> takes<00:01:15.119> soil<00:01:15.600> plant<00:01:16.109> nutrients

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
runs off it takes soil plant nutrients

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.559 
runs off it takes soil plant nutrients
like<00:01:16.709> fertilizer<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.429> chemical<00:01:18.119> well<00:01:18.389> that

00:01:18.559 --> 00:01:18.569 
like fertilizer and chemical well that

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:20.239 
like fertilizer and chemical well that
stuff<00:01:18.899> definitely<00:01:19.499> is<00:01:19.619> not<00:01:19.770> good<00:01:20.009> for<00:01:20.039> the

00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:20.249 
stuff definitely is not good for the

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:22.669 
stuff definitely is not good for the
environment<00:01:20.340> plus<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.209> farmers<00:01:21.630> like<00:01:22.289> us<00:01:22.409> on

00:01:22.669 --> 00:01:22.679 
environment plus the farmers like us on

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:24.080 
environment plus the farmers like us on
the<00:01:22.799> farm<00:01:22.979> we<00:01:23.310> would<00:01:23.459> like<00:01:23.609> to<00:01:23.639> keep<00:01:23.880> that

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
the farm we would like to keep that

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.429 
the farm we would like to keep that
stuff<00:01:24.389> on<00:01:24.539> our<00:01:24.569> farm<00:01:24.899> because<00:01:25.170> that's

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
stuff on our farm because that's

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.219 
stuff on our farm because that's
expensive<00:01:26.130> stuff<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.789> what<00:01:27.389> we<00:01:27.539> do<00:01:27.719> is<00:01:27.929> we<00:01:28.049> put

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
expensive stuff so what we do is we put

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.410 
expensive stuff so what we do is we put
this<00:01:28.350> tile<00:01:28.679> in<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.189> takes<00:01:29.459> the<00:01:29.609> excess<00:01:30.149> water

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
this tile in it takes the excess water

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.059 
this tile in it takes the excess water
away<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:31.079> then<00:01:31.289> when<00:01:31.469> we<00:01:31.560> get<00:01:31.709> a<00:01:31.740> two<00:01:31.920> inch

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:32.069 
away and then when we get a two inch

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:33.709 
away and then when we get a two inch
rain<00:01:32.279> now<00:01:32.490> where<00:01:32.700> does<00:01:32.849> it<00:01:32.999> go<00:01:33.119> now<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.539> gets

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:33.719 
rain now where does it go now it gets

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:35.209 
rain now where does it go now it gets
the<00:01:33.810> chance<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.109> soak<00:01:34.469> into<00:01:34.649> the<00:01:34.799> ground<00:01:35.039> and

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:35.219 
the chance to soak into the ground and

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:37.459 
the chance to soak into the ground and
when<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.639> soaks<00:01:35.909> in<00:01:36.149> soil<00:01:36.779> can<00:01:37.020> do<00:01:37.139> its<00:01:37.259> natural

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:37.469 
when it soaks in soil can do its natural

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:39.709 
when it soaks in soil can do its natural
job<00:01:37.950> which<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.549> filter<00:01:39.090> out<00:01:39.270> contaminants

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:39.719 
job which is to filter out contaminants

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:42.620 
job which is to filter out contaminants
by<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.349> time<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:41.009> water<00:01:41.490> reaches<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.240> tile

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
by the time the water reaches that tile

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.349 
by the time the water reaches that tile
it's<00:01:43.049> clean<00:01:43.529> we've<00:01:43.859> tested<00:01:44.159> water<00:01:44.789> coming<00:01:45.270> out

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:45.359 
it's clean we've tested water coming out

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:47.389 
it's clean we've tested water coming out
of<00:01:45.419> our<00:01:45.659> tile<00:01:45.929> it's<00:01:46.349> clean<00:01:46.679> in<00:01:46.889> fact<00:01:47.069> a<00:01:47.159> lot<00:01:47.310> of

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
of our tile it's clean in fact a lot of

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.550 
of our tile it's clean in fact a lot of
times<00:01:47.579> it's<00:01:47.789> drinking<00:01:48.270> water<00:01:48.479> quality<00:01:48.719> that's

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
times it's drinking water quality that's

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.109 
times it's drinking water quality that's
what<00:01:49.770> we're<00:01:49.919> trying<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.219> do<00:01:50.340> it's<00:01:50.579> good<00:01:50.909> for

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
what we're trying to do it's good for

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.760 
what we're trying to do it's good for
the<00:01:51.209> environment<00:01:51.439> basically<00:01:52.439> what<00:01:52.619> we're

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
the environment basically what we're

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.529 
the environment basically what we're
doing<00:01:52.799> when<00:01:53.340> we<00:01:53.459> talk<00:01:53.639> about<00:01:53.669> tiling<00:01:54.329> if<00:01:54.450> you

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
doing when we talk about tiling if you

doing when we talk about tiling if you
aren't<00:01:54.659> familiar<00:01:54.779> with<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.200> concept<00:01:55.709> it's

00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:55.889 
aren't familiar with the concept it's

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:57.800 
aren't familiar with the concept it's
putting<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.310> plastic<00:01:56.849> hose<00:01:57.029> that<00:01:57.450> has<00:01:57.509> some

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
putting a plastic hose that has some

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.719 
putting a plastic hose that has some
tiny<00:01:58.020> little<00:01:58.169> holes<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.069> underneath<00:01:59.429> the

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
tiny little holes in it underneath the

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.550 
tiny little holes in it underneath the
soil<00:01:59.909> about<00:02:00.239> three<00:02:00.539> feet<00:02:00.749> deep<00:02:00.929> that<00:02:01.289> way<00:02:01.409> the

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
soil about three feet deep that way the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.289 
soil about three feet deep that way the
water<00:02:01.709> can<00:02:02.039> move<00:02:02.189> down<00:02:02.489> through<00:02:02.819> three<00:02:03.029> feet

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
water can move down through three feet

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.690 
water can move down through three feet
of<00:02:03.450> soil<00:02:03.630> filter<00:02:04.200> out<00:02:04.349> any<00:02:04.590> impurities<00:02:05.489> and

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
of soil filter out any impurities and

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.669 
of soil filter out any impurities and
basically<00:02:06.299> end<00:02:06.479> up<00:02:06.599> with<00:02:06.810> almost<00:02:07.049> drinking

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
basically end up with almost drinking

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:09.740 
basically end up with almost drinking
water<00:02:07.919> quality<00:02:08.550> water<00:02:08.729> coming<00:02:09.450> out<00:02:09.540> of<00:02:09.660> this

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
water quality water coming out of this

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.510 
water quality water coming out of this
drainage<00:02:10.200> tile<00:02:10.410> it's<00:02:10.619> about<00:02:10.830> three<00:02:11.130> feet<00:02:11.160> down

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
drainage tile it's about three feet down

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.059 
drainage tile it's about three feet down
so<00:02:11.970> on<00:02:12.240> our<00:02:12.630> farm<00:02:12.960> we<00:02:13.110> bought<00:02:13.290> our<00:02:13.440> own<00:02:13.470> tile

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
so on our farm we bought our own tile

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.770 
so on our farm we bought our own tile
a<00:02:14.099> little<00:02:14.459> over<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.700> year<00:02:14.969> ago<00:02:15.359> and<00:02:15.450> one<00:02:15.629> of<00:02:15.719> the

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
a little over a year ago and one of the

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.750 
a little over a year ago and one of the
main<00:02:15.959> reasons<00:02:16.379> why<00:02:16.530> we<00:02:16.739> did<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:16.950> is<00:02:17.189> we<00:02:17.400> figured

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
main reasons why we did it is we figured

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.059 
main reasons why we did it is we figured
we<00:02:18.030> have<00:02:18.269> hundreds<00:02:19.079> of<00:02:19.230> thousands<00:02:19.769> of<00:02:19.859> feet<00:02:20.010> of

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
we have hundreds of thousands of feet of

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.949 
we have hundreds of thousands of feet of
tile<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:20.639> we<00:02:20.819> would<00:02:20.969> like<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.150> put<00:02:21.420> in<00:02:21.599> and

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
tile that we would like to put in and

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.239 
tile that we would like to put in and

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:23.249 
that's going to cost an awful lot of

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:25.369 
that's going to cost an awful lot of
money<00:02:23.459> and<00:02:23.609> it's<00:02:23.939> a<00:02:23.999> job<00:02:24.269> that<00:02:24.510> will<00:02:24.719> pay<00:02:24.959> us<00:02:25.200> a
