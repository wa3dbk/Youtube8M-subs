and the detailing was kept to a minimum
but<00:00:48.130> the<00:00:48.250> gameplay<00:00:48.520> was<00:00:48.940> quite<00:00:49.240> smooth<00:00:49.650> there

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.650 
but the gameplay was quite smooth there

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.680 
but the gameplay was quite smooth there
were<00:00:50.770> no<00:00:50.800> glitches<00:00:51.220> or<00:00:51.550> lags<00:00:51.880> whatsoever

during<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.230> gameplay<00:00:53.440> and<00:00:53.860> we<00:00:54.130> noticed<00:00:54.550> that

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
during the gameplay and we noticed that

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.210 
during the gameplay and we noticed that
there<00:00:54.790> was<00:00:55.150> no<00:00:55.390> Road<00:00:55.660> reflections<00:00:56.320> and<00:00:56.560> very

there was no Road reflections and very

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.970 
there was no Road reflections and very

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
minimal car equations the Dutch was

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.470 
minimal car equations the Dutch was
pretty<00:01:00.220> responsive<00:01:00.850> on<00:01:01.030> a<00:01:01.059> gameplay

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
pretty responsive on a gameplay

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.690 
pretty responsive on a gameplay
experience<00:01:01.960> was<00:01:02.170> quite<00:01:02.500> good<00:01:02.530> meaning<00:01:03.430> it

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:03.700 
experience was quite good meaning it

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.660 
experience was quite good meaning it
might<00:01:03.910> be<00:01:04.120> at<00:01:04.239> least<00:01:04.510> 16<00:01:05.020> FPS<00:01:05.590> because<00:01:06.280> it<00:01:06.430> was

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
might be at least 16 FPS because it was

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.350 
might be at least 16 FPS because it was
that<00:01:06.940> smooth<00:01:07.300> so<00:01:08.020> that's<00:01:08.350> asphalt<00:01:08.950> 7<00:01:09.360> no

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
that smooth so that's asphalt 7 no

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.040 
that smooth so that's asphalt 7 no
graphics<00:01:10.870> but<00:01:11.080> good<00:01:11.470> decent

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.950 

let's<00:01:16.620> try<00:01:16.830> dead<00:01:17.160> trigger<00:01:17.370> now<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:18.600> river<00:01:18.930> is

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
let's try dead trigger now that river is

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.850 
let's try dead trigger now that river is
a<00:01:19.110> game<00:01:20.010> that<00:01:20.040> runs<00:01:20.520> on<00:01:20.760> the<00:01:20.940> Unity<00:01:21.660> engine<00:01:21.860> so

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
a game that runs on the Unity engine so

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.250 
a game that runs on the Unity engine so
the<00:01:23.070> graphics<00:01:23.490> are<00:01:23.700> really<00:01:23.910> good<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.540> as<00:01:25.080> we

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
the graphics are really good and as we

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.230 
the graphics are really good and as we
tested<00:01:25.650> on<00:01:25.830> earlier<00:01:26.250> devices<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.850> gameplay

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
tested on earlier devices the gameplay

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.280 
tested on earlier devices the gameplay
was<00:01:27.270> good<00:01:27.720> too<00:01:27.960> let's<00:01:28.650> ride<00:01:28.950> out<00:01:29.010> on<00:01:30.290> galaxy

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
was good too let's ride out on galaxy

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.100 
was good too let's ride out on galaxy
mega<00:01:31.470> 5.8

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.630 

as<00:01:36.110> he<00:01:36.350> noticed<00:01:36.710> in<00:01:36.860> dead<00:01:37.130> trigger<00:01:37.369> the

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
as he noticed in dead trigger the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.600 
as he noticed in dead trigger the
graphics<00:01:38.060> were<00:01:38.270> bad<00:01:38.539> but<00:01:39.229> the<00:01:39.439> game<00:01:39.680> was<00:01:39.890> laggy

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
graphics were bad but the game was laggy

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.609 
graphics were bad but the game was laggy
and<00:01:40.939> they<00:01:41.570> were<00:01:41.630> minor<00:01:41.930> jitters<00:01:42.380> all

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
and they were minor jitters all

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.469 
and they were minor jitters all
throughout<00:01:42.829> so<00:01:43.219> their<00:01:43.729> graphics<00:01:44.179> and<00:01:44.450> the

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
throughout so their graphics and the

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.490 
throughout so their graphics and the
gameplay<00:01:45.110> was<00:01:45.439> not<00:01:46.070> really<00:01:46.399> smooth<00:01:46.700> and

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
gameplay was not really smooth and

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.020 
gameplay was not really smooth and

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
you saw is not really optimal so do stay
