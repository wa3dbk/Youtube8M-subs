common but you can get it is where the

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.180 
common but you can get it is where the
washers<00:01:03.389> are<00:01:03.690> located<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.350> just<00:01:04.710> put<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.890> drop

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
washers are located you just put a drop

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:12.499

of oil on the washers and turn it the

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:14.450 
of oil on the washers and turn it the
third<00:01:12.719> place<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.200> can<00:01:13.500> get<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.770> squeak<00:01:14.250> but

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
third place you can get a squeak but

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.520 
third place you can get a squeak but
very<00:01:14.700> unlikely<00:01:15.299> but<00:01:15.630> sometimes<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.290> might

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
very unlikely but sometimes it might

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.319 
very unlikely but sometimes it might
happen<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:17.509> when<00:01:18.509> you're<00:01:18.689> turning<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:20.329> small

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329 
happen is when you're turning the small

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:28.429 
happen is when you're turning the small
pulley<00:01:21.770> simply<00:01:22.880> remove<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.090> cone<00:01:27.439> it

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
pulley simply remove the cone it

pulley as you're doing this remove the
upper<00:01:34.950> section<00:01:35.369> put<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.210> drop<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.509> oil<00:01:36.899> on<00:01:37.229> the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
upper section put a drop of oil on the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.330 
upper section put a drop of oil on the
shaft<00:01:38.009> put<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:39.000> back<00:01:39.439> replace<00:01:40.439> your<00:01:40.770> cone<00:01:40.979> it

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
shaft put this back replace your cone it

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.969 
shaft put this back replace your cone it
hold<00:01:41.579> holding<00:01:41.969> this<00:01:42.060> up<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.560> wheel

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
hold holding this up so that the wheel

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.569 
hold holding this up so that the wheel
is<00:01:44.280> off<00:01:44.609> the<00:01:44.909> cone<00:01:45.200> make<00:01:46.200> sure<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.490> screw<00:01:47.490> it

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
is off the cone make sure you screw it

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.490 
is off the cone make sure you screw it
on<00:01:47.700> straight<00:01:48.060> don't<00:01:48.299> cross<00:01:48.600> thread<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.960> but<00:01:49.200> it

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
on straight don't cross thread it but it

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.349 
on straight don't cross thread it but it
should<00:01:49.679> go<00:01:49.770> on<00:01:49.799> nice<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.490> easily<00:01:50.700> holding

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:51.359 
should go on nice and easily holding

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:53.359 
should go on nice and easily holding
this<00:01:51.479> up<00:01:51.689> so<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.960> doesn't<00:01:52.229> touch<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.159> can

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
this up so it doesn't touch so you can

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.389 
this up so it doesn't touch so you can
turn<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.719> just<00:01:54.960> screw<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.350> on<00:01:55.530> until

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
turn that and just screw it on until

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.450 
turn that and just screw it on until
it's<00:01:57.079> seats<00:01:58.079> make<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.350> finger<00:01:58.710> tight<00:01:58.979> that's

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
it's seats make a finger tight that's

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.459 
it's seats make a finger tight that's
all<00:01:59.789> that<00:02:00.420> should<00:02:00.630> that'll<00:02:00.929> eliminate<00:02:01.140> this

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
all that should that'll eliminate this

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.179 
all that should that'll eliminate this
week<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:01.950> that's<00:02:02.609> all<00:02:02.939> let's<00:02:03.119> do<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.829> have<00:02:04.829> fun
