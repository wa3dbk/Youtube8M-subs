00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.220 

I<00:00:00.240> guess<00:00:00.750> explaining<00:00:01.650> the<00:00:01.770> Flintstone<00:00:02.340> flip<00:00:02.790> a

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:03.230 
I guess explaining the Flintstone flip a

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.079 
I guess explaining the Flintstone flip a
little<00:00:04.230> bit<00:00:04.350> of<00:00:04.470> history<00:00:04.830> when<00:00:05.400> I<00:00:05.490> was<00:00:05.640> 19

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
little bit of history when I was 19

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.470 
little bit of history when I was 19
years<00:00:06.120> old<00:00:06.480> I<00:00:06.660> went<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:06.960> Tahiti<00:00:07.350> and<00:00:08.030> a<00:00:09.030> bunch

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
years old I went to Tahiti and a bunch

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.080 
years old I went to Tahiti and a bunch
of<00:00:09.570> friends<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.139> I<00:00:10.740> were<00:00:10.980> just<00:00:11.190> trying<00:00:11.700> to<00:00:11.910> do

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
of friends and I were just trying to do

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.070 
of friends and I were just trying to do
big<00:00:12.509> airs<00:00:12.809> out<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.349> back<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:14.750> that's<00:00:15.750> kind<00:00:16.020> of

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
big airs out the back and that's kind of

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.189 
big airs out the back and that's kind of
how<00:00:16.230> I<00:00:16.260> discovered<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.910> rotation<00:00:18.600> it's<00:00:18.990> a

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
how I discovered the rotation it's a

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.040 
how I discovered the rotation it's a
vertical<00:00:19.590> rotation<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.730> if<00:00:21.720> you<00:00:21.930> were

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
vertical rotation and if you were

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.320 
vertical rotation and if you were
jumping<00:00:22.470> off<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.949> diving<00:00:23.100> board<00:00:23.550> they'd<00:00:24.060> call

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
jumping off a diving board they'd call

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.730 
jumping off a diving board they'd call
it<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.539> gainer<00:00:24.810> because<00:00:25.380> you're<00:00:25.560> moving

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
it a gainer because you're moving

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.519 
it a gainer because you're moving
forward<00:00:26.330> but<00:00:27.330> you're<00:00:27.480> doing<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.869> backflip<00:00:28.320> at

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
forward but you're doing a backflip at

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.650 
forward but you're doing a backflip at
the<00:00:28.650> same<00:00:28.859> time<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.820> have<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.179> get<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.480> right

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
the same time you have to get the right

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.510 
the same time you have to get the right
section<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.560> everything<00:00:32.189> has<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.369> come

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
section and everything has to come

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.120 
section and everything has to come
together<00:00:32.790> for<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.570> actually<00:00:34.130> complete

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
together for you to actually complete

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.630 
together for you to actually complete
this<00:00:35.340> maneuver<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.630> just<00:00:37.530> turned<00:00:37.680> 27<00:00:38.280> now

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
this maneuver and I just turned 27 now

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.940 
this maneuver and I just turned 27 now
and<00:00:38.969> it's<00:00:39.090> oh<00:00:39.329> it's<00:00:39.360> been<00:00:39.690> eight<00:00:40.230> years<00:00:40.290> in<00:00:40.860> the

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
and it's oh it's been eight years in the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.970 
and it's oh it's been eight years in the
making<00:00:41.160> basically<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:42.030> just<00:00:42.860> attempt<00:00:43.860> after

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
making basically of just attempt after

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.150 
making basically of just attempt after
attempt<00:00:44.670> after<00:00:44.789> attempt<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.570> just<00:00:46.070> trying<00:00:47.070> to

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
attempt after attempt of just trying to

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.479 
attempt after attempt of just trying to
do<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.879> backflip<00:00:48.329> about<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.719> year<00:00:49.079> ago<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.620> landed

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
do a backflip about a year ago I landed

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.490 
do a backflip about a year ago I landed
a<00:00:50.610> couple<00:00:50.820> I'd<00:00:51.270> rolled<00:00:51.750> him<00:00:51.899> out<00:00:51.989> but<00:00:52.230> no<00:00:52.379> one

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
a couple I'd rolled him out but no one

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.170 
a couple I'd rolled him out but no one
was<00:00:52.620> around<00:00:52.890> no<00:00:53.129> one<00:00:53.280> saw<00:00:53.520> him<00:00:53.730> no<00:00:54.059> one

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
was around no one saw him no one

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.049 
was around no one saw him no one
captured<00:00:54.629> him<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.250> just<00:00:56.250> recently<00:00:56.460> we

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
captured him and just recently we

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.240 
captured him and just recently we
finally<00:00:57.600> got<00:00:57.750> him<00:00:57.930> on<00:00:58.050> footage<00:00:58.350> we<00:00:58.680> got<00:00:58.739> to

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
finally got him on footage we got to

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.729 
finally got him on footage we got to
this<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.510> first<00:01:00.780> Flintstone<00:01:01.320> flip<00:01:01.590> we

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
this is the first Flintstone flip we

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.539 
this is the first Flintstone flip we
captured<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:02.910> spring<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.070> I<00:01:05.070> really<00:01:05.400> like

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
captured this spring and I really like

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.440 
captured this spring and I really like
this<00:01:05.790> clip<00:01:06.090> because<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:08.070> angle<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.640> it's

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
this clip because of the angle and it's

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.850 
this clip because of the angle and it's
almost<00:01:09.630> like<00:01:09.900> you're<00:01:10.049> going<00:01:10.229> down<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.680> line

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
almost like you're going down the line

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.990 
almost like you're going down the line
with<00:01:11.100> me<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.909> shows<00:01:12.380> how<00:01:13.549> once<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.729> leave

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
with me and it shows how once I leave

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.050 
with me and it shows how once I leave
the<00:01:15.270> lip<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.689> projects<00:01:16.500> me<00:01:16.619> out<00:01:16.830> into<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
the lip it projects me out into the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.719 
the lip it projects me out into the
shoulder<00:01:18.570> basically<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.500> really<00:01:20.220> like<00:01:20.369> how<00:01:20.580> it

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
shoulder basically I really like how it

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.469 
shoulder basically I really like how it
shows<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.360> height<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.140> air<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.640> how

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
shows the height of the air and and how

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.050 
shows the height of the air and and how
perfect<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.740> section<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.250> was<00:01:26.430> because<00:01:26.909> I

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
perfect of a section that was because I

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.109 
perfect of a section that was because I
I'm<00:01:27.540> able<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:27.930> just<00:01:28.229> stomp<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:29.280> landing<00:01:29.759> right

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
I'm able to just stomp the landing right

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.550 
I'm able to just stomp the landing right
on<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.450> shoulder<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.930> right<00:01:31.079> out<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.320> it

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
on the shoulder and right out of it

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.789 
on the shoulder and right out of it
clean<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.540> this<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.900> second<00:01:34.320> Flintstone

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
clean and this is the second Flintstone

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.539 
clean and this is the second Flintstone
flip<00:01:35.100> we<00:01:35.820> captured<00:01:36.360> about<00:01:36.780> two<00:01:37.229> weeks<00:01:37.549> after

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
flip we captured about two weeks after

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.600 
flip we captured about two weeks after
the<00:01:38.670> first<00:01:38.880> one<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:40.320> really<00:01:40.619> like<00:01:40.799> this

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
the first one and I really like this

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.819 
the first one and I really like this
clip<00:01:42.000> because<00:01:42.420> if<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.409> look<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
clip because if you look in the

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.859 
clip because if you look in the
background<00:01:44.310> there's<00:01:44.579> three<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.540> my<00:01:45.659> really

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
background there's three of my really

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.740 
background there's three of my really
good<00:01:46.049> friends<00:01:46.530> all<00:01:46.799> watching<00:01:47.579> from<00:01:48.570> behind

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
good friends all watching from behind

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.370 
good friends all watching from behind
the<00:01:49.020> wave<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:50.210> remember<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.960> was<00:01:52.140> pretty

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
the wave and I remember that was pretty

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.859 
the wave and I remember that was pretty
classic<00:01:52.590> they're<00:01:53.009> all<00:01:53.189> psyched<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:54.420> see<00:01:54.450> that

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
classic they're all psyched to see that

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.350 
classic they're all psyched to see that
oh<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:56.009> got<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.369> little<00:01:56.610> head<00:01:57.149> dip

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
oh and I got a little head dip

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.490 
oh and I got a little head dip
afterwards<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:59.130> shows<00:01:59.880> that<00:01:59.909> it's<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.570> it's

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
afterwards so it shows that it's a it's

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.429 
afterwards so it shows that it's a it's
a<00:02:01.710> functional<00:02:02.579> maneuver<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.270> that's<00:02:04.049> the

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
a functional maneuver and that's the

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.730 
a functional maneuver and that's the
beginning<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:05.040> guess<00:02:05.100> it's<00:02:05.549> a
