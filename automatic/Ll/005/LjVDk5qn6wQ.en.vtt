use a jig saw you can even use a
straight<00:01:17.670> edge<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.030> knife

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
straight edge and a knife

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.460 
straight edge and a knife
although<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.310> more<00:01:20.460> difficult<00:01:21.170> the<00:01:22.170> most

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
although that is more difficult the most

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.789 
although that is more difficult the most
effective<00:01:23.130> size<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:24.299> we<00:01:24.509> found<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:25.500> cut<00:01:25.770> a

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
effective size that we found to cut a

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.969 
effective size that we found to cut a
sheet<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:27.600> cut<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:29.689> cut<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.780> into

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
sheet in is to cut it in to cut it into

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.179 
sheet in is to cut it in to cut it into
40<00:01:31.979> inch<00:01:32.159> long<00:01:32.670> 10<00:01:33.390> inch<00:01:33.540> wide<00:01:33.900> pieces<00:01:34.470> first

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
40 inch long 10 inch wide pieces first

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.490 
40 inch long 10 inch wide pieces first
to<00:01:35.400> cut<00:01:35.549> into<00:01:35.759> 40<00:01:36.090> inch<00:01:36.240> lengths<00:01:36.990> here

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
to cut into 40 inch lengths here

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.700 
to cut into 40 inch lengths here
so<00:01:37.860> they've<00:01:38.250> giant<00:01:38.759> 40<00:01:39.060> inch<00:01:39.180> piece<00:01:39.390> like<00:01:39.600> that

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
so they've giant 40 inch piece like that

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.740 
so they've giant 40 inch piece like that
and<00:01:40.710> we<00:01:40.860> cut<00:01:41.040> out<00:01:41.130> into<00:01:41.280> 10<00:01:41.490> inch<00:01:41.640> lengths<00:01:42.630> I

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
and we cut out into 10 inch lengths I

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.639 
and we cut out into 10 inch lengths I
hid<00:01:42.930> like<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.350> we<00:01:43.950> got<00:01:44.100> 40<00:01:45.060> inches<00:01:47.240> 40<00:01:48.240> here

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
hid like that we got 40 inches 40 here

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.429 
hid like that we got 40 inches 40 here
10<00:01:49.649> here<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.450> what's<00:01:51.450> really<00:01:51.780> important<00:01:52.259> is

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
10 here and what's really important is

10 here and what's really important is
that<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.670> see<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.909> grain<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.270> wood<00:01:54.299> it's

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
that you see the grain of the wood it's

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.240 
that you see the grain of the wood it's
really<00:01:55.439> important<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.920> grain<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.159> the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
really important that the grain of the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.249 
really important that the grain of the
wood<00:01:56.280> go<00:01:56.820> for<00:01:57.240> length<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.780> deck<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.140> is

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
wood go for length of the deck this is

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.359 
wood go for length of the deck this is
going<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.439> be<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.649> deck<00:01:59.630> okay<00:02:00.979> so<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.100> what<00:02:02.250> is

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
going to be the deck okay so the what is

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.490 
going to be the deck okay so the what is
strongest<00:02:02.850> in<00:02:03.000> this<00:02:03.119> direction<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:04.320> want

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
strongest in this direction so you want

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.870 
strongest in this direction so you want

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
to lay it up like this so it's the least

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.680 
to lay it up like this so it's the least
likely<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.299> snap<00:02:06.600> this<00:02:07.530> area<00:02:07.890> over<00:02:07.979> here<00:02:08.690> this

to cut this into a 40 inch length and

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.800 
to cut this into a 40 inch length and
get<00:02:19.470> two<00:02:19.800> more<00:02:20.150> four<00:02:21.150> segments<00:02:21.540> out<00:02:21.630> of<00:02:21.720> this

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
get two more four segments out of this

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:22.880 
get two more four segments out of this
they're<00:02:21.990> going<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.140> be<00:02:22.200> cross<00:02:22.500> green<00:02:22.770> so

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
they're going to be cross green so

we<00:02:24.510> can<00:02:24.660> use<00:02:24.870> these<00:02:25.140> two<00:02:25.380> pieces<00:02:25.820> to<00:02:26.820> get<00:02:26.940> more

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
we can use these two pieces to get more

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.660 
we can use these two pieces to get more
board<00:02:28.820> permission<00:02:31.190> so<00:02:32.190> I'm<00:02:32.280> going<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.490> cut
