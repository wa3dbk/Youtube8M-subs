00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:14.330
 One more time and that was when I was in 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.279
 last time first asked so 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.930
 once my head why I have 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:23.449
 now also created a video westerwald 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.939
 I also have to watch a lot 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.710
 asked how to make it in america 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.990
 because she is supposed to be as well 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.980
 scared berlin we dive 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:36.530
 all politicians beck in mainz until the 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.140
 make it fuller and easy today 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.110
 let's show because I'm the guest of the party 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.050
 but also with this smoked and with it 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.350
 yes , and so I know so positive 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.360
 surprised to have before 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.070
 Chanels are all made to sit 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.170
 normal 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:57.830
 and there is always the problem straight 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.230
 party is a problem that is 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:03.170
 the principle and therefore with which 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.940
 trends that means this technology is in 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.790
 A tough thing with mom at home 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.780
 wants to smoke alone or with one or 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.430
 two friends 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.850
 we wanted to ask are last 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.630
 Strength and to show how it is true 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.070
 do 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:22.700
 I just have a simple one now 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:26.470
 Cost long are then quite normal and that 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.470
 tastes yes 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.080
 but this is no time the people 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.600
 So I know now with something I want 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.800
 try it for the first time and right 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.770
 expensive it is any protested 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.619
 against we from the forum group travels 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.890
 extra for giving to yourself 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.560
 Show as we have them twice now 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:55.420
 Enthusiastic about technology and yes indeed 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:02:00.430
 which still foil the the 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:04.000
 Maybe quantities are not 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:08.160
 Betrayed who else will you her 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.690
 favorite and is a real thriller 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.520
 because I'm very happy that politician 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.370
 the taste understanding comes faster 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.830
 but lewis leaves that we drift 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.950
 the so maybe say now 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.620
 Germany just not me yes 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.230
 believe it is enough so that's really already 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.010
 twice to three times the amount 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:35.360
 pure kloppen 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:36.689
 but that we are here even the crowd 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.760
 discontinued 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:44.459
 used here is considered to be critical 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.829
 So that's quite a lot and you will 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.650
 but not a little I have now 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:52.530
 provisionally made in the head 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:03:02.689
 because I do not have a clear word now 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:02.689
 from above as illegal 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:12.700
 yes it is the crowd in our club 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:23.060
 and now we see now have full out 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:23.900
 is now back simply my side he 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.640
 was a bit down 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:31.060
 But it is not completely mensa 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.060
 and looks 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.890
 with the band 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.620
 which is already extremely crowded because you have 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:50.160
 not so good can see from the side 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:54.660
 is not completely full 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:57.930
 is then another topic and indeed in 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.710
 america has to like the other films 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.350
 in Germany 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.120
 they have fat because I have it there too 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:07.230
 but I have none to pick 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.540
 which corresponds to about 2 load and the whole 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.290
 normal German film because there 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.890
 maybe even a video 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:19.020
 the americans just have to see that 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:22.720
 the aluminum foil is extremely critical 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:24.280
 days over it 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.760
 [Applause] 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:31.260
 important is so nice to be curious so 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.260
 there really is nothing burning parliament 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.139
 so constantly exciting and now too 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.440
 the books 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:48.669
 In any case, see if here the 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.669
 star moment 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:11.999
 namely that most of the 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:16.559
 number of substances I have just now 

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:18.659
 accepted and transfer and the holes 

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:22.050
 clarify how he is so relative 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:28.080
 big and the americans are doing too 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:30.979
 big holes but not many there 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.979
 it would be like this 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:37.649
 and therefore, as you go further though 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:40.520
 But those with the longer help me 

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:40.520
 I'm far away now 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.409
 so 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.130
 the 1 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:02.830
 that was it 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:06.250
 I would think that's relatively big, that is 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:13.180
 it costs about so old finished so nice 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:21.789
 that was crazy at china this events 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:26.310
 &amp; Nagel 620 method are 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:31.449
 be berlin I have here audience 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:35.169
 again half shortened so then 

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:37.629
 saw mine and three of them 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:39.210
 then later put the world on the head 

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:42.009
 sidled up 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:44.379
 Well, that means who is now the head 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:47.640
 continue with cola and then see 

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:52.300
 we discovered again 

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:52.300
