00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.530
 I do not know the k 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.309
 we go that one thing is that they have sounded and business that life 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.789
 a type of approach 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:14.959
 because I had her 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:17.240
 for the next few years cases 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.679
 clear that if there is no guarantee 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:23.779
 name seemed normal to me if paco gonzález and pepe sunday chestnut like 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:25.140
 tomorrow any 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.039
 figures of the state radio 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.269
 on the street market 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.760
 it is logical that companies can 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.090
 of construction our this type of loans 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.170
 this compulsion this earthquake there has been 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.789
 oo I think it's interesting in every way likewise and for attracting 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:47.180
 the proposal 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.320
 and to 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.810
 the breath shook 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.680
 little more 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.330
 I had and the radio already and there they finished and they stopped because they were 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.750
 inconsequence has put the accent in the specific situations or conjunctural 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.879
 that occur as 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:02.120
 the play 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.820
 but a long time ago that also starts a small battle very dull metal that is 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.080
 unmask a little people 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.230
 I like me I do not like well-known journalists who have earned the 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.510
 prestige 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.040
 in his first time especially as 110 people went eastward the most 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.640
 strong possible I think it's the most important thing that the profession 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.990
 and I observed 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.549
 that there is a dependency that the most important means of communication to 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.030
 bounty times 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.950
 sometimes vomitive you unnecessary when you are god you do not have to be 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.690
 supported that nobody has to be the president of the real madrid of which 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.690
 be afraid to respect because it is a means of 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.530
 but that they do not advance independence because there are others that 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.840
 we pay taxes 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.160
 I'm not bullfighting, I'm not willing to tolerate anyone raising the band 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.980
 independent I know we're going to attend a guerrilla war in each one 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:51.870
 trench 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.119
 where the seat will prevail 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.560
 interests of all kinds 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.840
 where strange bedfellows are going to be made with people who 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.570
 he has been mercilessly whipped before 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.540
 and where anything is not worth 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.930
 people can do it is in its perfect right to do it 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.520
 but do not presume about it because some mosquitoes that we are going to 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.689
 take 

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:12.300
 but I do it with the profession or 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.209
 really and you know me I do it with the profession 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.019
 not for the punctual battle that touches for the profession rosa I am for journalists 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.219
 that has been very independent all his life to which I have a respect and I 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:24.839
 extraordinary process 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:29.069
 isea of ​​many other journalists who have not been independent mouths that for their 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.979
 very important media means or services b 

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:36.499
 and that afterwards they want to boast of having influence opinion the pesista malas 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:38.940
 news because you become the president's boss 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.830
 so you very well is a form of dementia exercised by the profession 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.789
 this independent way 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:47.789
 because if you defend me in unstable tucson 

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:50.060
 what happens 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.589
 of studies handled 

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:52.979
 the orchestral maneuvers
