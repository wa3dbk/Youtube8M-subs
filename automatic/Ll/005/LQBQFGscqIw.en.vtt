00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.370
 money name selenium pocket and tomorrow 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.590
 with the most convenient system of the year was 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.710
 the alarm clock of us transfers is 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.710
 payment system p. from there money on 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.270
 the map is displayed with minimal losses 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.029
 tip securely and quickly 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.300
 the output technique is described in detail in my 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.550
 video in this playlist so when and 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.920
 how much money should Elsa withdraw 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.070
 france in his pocket everything is under god 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.860
 We go including in France, therefore, as 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.260
 the minimum is necessary to begin to withdraw 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.239
 enclosed day 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.210
 if you took out a loan in the bank term 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.870
 determined by the terms of the loan in the bank and 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.780
 The case of 60 days is free to look at. 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.270
 video start a business with 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.030
 webtransfer so here we look at 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.890
 case of entering your money the amount of 300 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.680
 dollars all our activities 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.650
 aims to extract the greatest 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.080
 profit for yourself therefore I do not recommend 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.840
 apply for a period shorter 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.770
 twenty one days to come out 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.450
 maximum profit 60 percent 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.820
 more about choosing the optimal term 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.009
 see our credit actions 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.830
 appropriate rollers on this hold 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.080
 basically when and how much money 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.509
 the end of the next cycle bring yourself 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.180
 on the pocket everyone defines for himself 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.040
 here I will show when and how much money 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.100
 can be removed tomorrow yesterday 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.090
 to quickly reach the maximum 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.920
 income to the highway even inviting no one 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.140
 all I'm saying is not just dogma 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.320
 action guide to understand 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.149
 what exactly can you expect from working 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.460
 Now transfer that this should be done 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.189
 first you need to go out 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.770
 breakeven ie get yourself back on your pocket 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.200
 enclosed day 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.030
 I recommend starting to withdraw money 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.579
 after 4 cycles 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.850
 then the risk time will be about three 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:08.929
 month in the case of article with 3 will rise 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:11.450
 dollars you withdraw after 4 cycles 325 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.430
 out of pocket of curiosity we'll see 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.140
 how long to unwind your bank to 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.019
 the maximum is up to ten thousand 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:22.430
 dollars if you don't understand anything 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:25.069
 the table is ready to look and see 13 cycles 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.920
 it's 20 days plus 9 months 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:31.150
 here's the last cycle when we take out 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.910
 a thousand of 46 dollars and we have left 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:38.799
 10,000 for issuing loans while doing so 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:42.230
 end of the first year you take out 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.880
 8480 3 dollars is obviously the most 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.950
 profitable behavior 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.920
 however, everything under god we walk on this 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.930
 more optimal from my point of view 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.720
 behavior when at the end of the next 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.170
 cycle profit is divided 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.209
 about half and one part red 50 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.030
 dollars added in attachment 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.160
 and the rest of the profit is displayed on 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.900
 pocket I call it canonical 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.299
 method of profit sharing 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.549
 putting money in your pocket every time 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.920
 leave a red amount for investment 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.930
 networkers dollars mean all the money 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.150
 will work and anger need 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.840
 choose the optimal time for filing 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.310
 credit 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.470
 so I recommend using 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.650
 any standard issue date 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.819
 loans themselves use a term of 22 days 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:32.209
 I do not recommend it for calculations 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:35.209
 terms of 21 and 30 days they are the most 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:37.609
 popular so there would be more competition 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:40.819
 but this reasoning is not that this is only 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:43.459
 some considerations and so we see 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.980
 with the canonical distribution of profits 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:49.790
 first every twenty two days we 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:53.419
 we take out growing amounts of money 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.970
 and our bank is also growing with increasing 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:04:00.579
 the rate of this growth but to the end 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:05.280
 the first year would be on his pocket only 4 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:08.130
 1973 argument exactly in a year and 2 months 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.430
 after the start we will get 10,000 dollars 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:14.340
 for attachment of pocket views in total 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:18.959
 complexity by this time the order amount 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:21.239
 8 thousand 34 dollars I will note that with 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.870
 forced maximum output 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.660
 income 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.660
 a year and 2 months after the start you them 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.040
 whether it would be in the pocket 15 thousand two hundred 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.550
 fifteen dollars 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.090
 extra seven thousand two hundred dollars 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.760
 forced mode 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:39.120
 this is a fee for breaking even 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.580
 you just over five months did not understand 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.280
 money on a pocket everyone will solve 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.290
 does he need money right now or is he 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.930
 ready now to invest more to 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.450
 increase your future faster 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.700
 opportunities strictly speaking on completion 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.220
 each next cycle before us 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.560
 there is a strong and every time this 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.530
 the question can be resolved in its own way 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.990
 the more of us the amount of investment the wider 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.570
 our choices and as always 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.300
 of two evils it would be good to choose 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.490
 the smallest for today everything was with you 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.860
