 Hello, Calvin Jones here, Park Tool Company with Tech Tuesday 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:12.560
 in this video today we will look at the procedures for dimensioning a new chain on a derailleur bike. 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.080
 There are two basic procedures: the easy way and the hard way. 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.240
 it is generally accepted that we route a chain 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.119
 from the largest rear sprocket to the largest front sprocket, 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.399
 we want to add an inch of chain, which is two rivets. 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.900
 So let's first look at the hard way. 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.840
 First we move the derailleur all the way to the largest sprocket at the rear 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.760
 move the front derailleur to the largest sprocket at the front. 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.480
 Now we are going to grab the chain and drive it through the rear derailleur 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.360
 We cross the lower pulley in a straight line to the upper pulley 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.600
 We'll get behind the gears, in our If we want the biggest gear 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.360
 we feed the chain through it 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.220
 we put the chain on the front sprocket 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.550
 and now we are ready to pull the chain 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.620
 and measure the length. 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.670
 We pull it as tight as possible, 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.180
 I switch on that chainring, but I can't connect with the chain here. 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.970
 This outer plate cannot be connected to that outer plate 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.480
 although we think it is as short as possible, not really 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.340
 we must be worth a rivet 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.570
 so we get this outer to an inner. 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.160
 We count more than one rivet and two rivets, 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:04.100
 I'm going to mark that to make it easy to remember. 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.680
 I will now reach my chain tool and ... 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.820
 There must be a better way ... and it is! 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.260
 Start by getting rid of the derailleurs 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.580
 The rear derailleur: put it on the smallest sprocket. 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.320
 Let's take our necklace. 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.160
 We are going to route our chain over the largest sprocket 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.760
 We will bypass and completely skip those pulleys. 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.100
 We come to the front ring, 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.760
 make sure i'm engaged on the back, 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.920
 I'm engaged on the front 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.560
 what would we join? Similar situation here. 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.800
 I can't leave it here: I would have an outer plate that is connected to an outer plate. 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.290
 I have to support a rivet. 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.710
 This is where I could connect an outer plate with an inner plate. 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.340
 From this point here we remember more than one, two, 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.980
 there is the same black sign that we saw before. 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:24.440
 That is the same result as before, but in this way we do not fight any tension. 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.120
 The chain does not turn around, it is much easier. 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.920
 We can now bring this to the workbench, make our cut, and we are ready to install. 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.130
 Thank you.
