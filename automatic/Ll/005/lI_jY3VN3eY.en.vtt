00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:14.289
 it was the day 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.580
 the party means 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.870
 the video contest game publisher 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.650
 This is where the problem lies 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.650
 in the meantime he explained the course of the race 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.830
 as to know how to do 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.830
 vic and the facade controversy 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.440
 more than ever the same 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.090
 Sebastian is very scared for my country 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.600
 it's not him 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.560
 perfect 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.560
 webber 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.970
 many teachers 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.690
 I think it was due to begin in July 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.690
 I do not have the impression 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.500
 no no no 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.140
 your missions 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.809
 a bonus for us 

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:11.429
 at this time 

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:14.189
 because we are going to do 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:16.189
 we can go for a long journey 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:19.189
 and we have to stop bullshit 

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:24.179
 the matches go so fast 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:31.619
 yes I said well 

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:34.069
 the responsibility 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.089
 in the museum 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:38.819
 we want to attract people to the Haut-Rhin 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.259
 every year 

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:45.259
 francis xavier 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:49.149
 but what are they all going to live 

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:52.149
 what age limits 

00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:58.949
 no 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:00.739
 the world 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.739
 be all 

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:12.449
 it's one of the best of them 

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:28.399
 he 

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:30.829
 after this flash trip 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:32.859
 with the power in place 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:34.259
 now 

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:35.849
 the day before 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.239
 The report 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.940
 this thing to do for what price their bridge effect 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.329
 not a part 

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:57.490
 the recovery time is important 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.029
 for how long 

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:01.249
 chicken wages 

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:04.589
 go dad, not reveal everything 

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:05.609

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.609
 the caa 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.459
 according to m 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:21.870
 the same amendment does not create d when I see everything you do there 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.930
 warming up soon 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.879

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:29.879
 Wednesday night the transfer project to miss nothing because of the request 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.469
 good wind and good sea 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:35.099
 now this is the question that arose 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:36.840
 you have all the ingredients 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.909
 As a reminder 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:41.860
 these robbers bankers thieves 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.659
 if I am angry 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:44.809
 Versailles is cooked 

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:46.529
 six hours of play 

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:47.350
 Alas 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.490
 in parallel 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.340
 here 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.080

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:56.559
 at the helm 

00:04:56.559 --> 00:04:59.349
