anyway s get started so the method what

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.050 
anyway s get started so the method what
I'm<00:01:07.350> going<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.590> show<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.830> first<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.909> one

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
I'm going to show you first is the one

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.390 
I'm going to show you first is the one
knee<00:01:09.409> juggernaut<00:01:10.409> but<00:01:10.920> it's<00:01:11.070> just<00:01:11.220> outside

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
knee juggernaut but it's just outside

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.149 
knee juggernaut but it's just outside
down<00:01:11.939> bond<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.900> what<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.080> do<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.650> start<00:01:13.920> getting

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
down bond and what I do I start getting

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.950 
down bond and what I do I start getting
some<00:01:14.250> zombies<00:01:14.640> following<00:01:15.060> me<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.360> what<00:01:15.930> I

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
some zombies following me and what I

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.859 
some zombies following me and what I
start<00:01:16.619> circling<00:01:17.009> around<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:18.450> basically<00:01:18.780> I

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
start circling around so basically I

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.810 
start circling around so basically I
keep<00:01:19.140> circling<00:01:19.409> around<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.890> zombies<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.520> that

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
keep circling around the zombies in that

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.510 
keep circling around the zombies in that
area<00:01:21.060> I've<00:01:21.330> got<00:01:21.630> given<00:01:21.869> make<00:01:22.560> sure<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.280> don't

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
area I've got given make sure you don't

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.219 
area I've got given make sure you don't
get<00:01:23.759> caught<00:01:24.090> powerfully<00:01:24.659> by<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.080> other

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
get caught powerfully by the other

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.469 
get caught powerfully by the other
zombies<00:01:25.590> but<00:01:26.009> it's<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.640> pretty<00:01:26.820> good<00:01:27.030> method<00:01:27.450> to

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
zombies but it's a pretty good method to

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.170 
zombies but it's a pretty good method to
do<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.170> don't<00:01:28.799> it's<00:01:29.369> not<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.579> good<00:01:29.939> if<00:01:30.060> you

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
do and don't it's not that good if you

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.569 
do and don't it's not that good if you
get<00:01:30.329> someone<00:01:30.600> else<00:01:30.780> coming<00:01:30.990> along<00:01:31.380> with<00:01:31.860> some

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
get someone else coming along with some

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.399 
get someone else coming along with some
more<00:01:32.729> zombies<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.570> could<00:01:33.780> die<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.200> way

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
more zombies and you could die that way

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.330 
more zombies and you could die that way
but<00:01:34.470> it's<00:01:35.460> not<00:01:36.000> likely<00:01:36.540> big<00:01:36.930> do<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.590> most<00:01:38.130> of

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
but it's not likely big do that most of

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.190 
but it's not likely big do that most of
the<00:01:38.430> time<00:01:38.670> I'd<00:01:38.909> actually<00:01:39.150> do<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.509> there<00:01:40.079> is

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
the time I'd actually do it there is

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.080 
the time I'd actually do it there is
some<00:01:40.350> stuff<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:40.979> actually<00:01:41.430> need<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.820> need<00:01:42.000> to

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
some stuff you actually need you need to

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.660 
some stuff you actually need you need to
get<00:01:42.240> juggernaut<00:01:42.780> quick<00:01:43.229> revive<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:44.040> not

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
get juggernaut quick revive and not

as<00:02:20.740> well<00:02:20.980> and<00:02:21.280> galley<00:02:21.940> not<00:02:22.720> really<00:02:23.230> but<00:02:23.470> you

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
as well and galley not really but you

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.470 
as well and galley not really but you
can<00:02:23.860> use<00:02:24.069> it<00:02:24.100> if<00:02:24.220> you<00:02:24.310> prefer<00:02:24.940> it<00:02:25.090> but<00:02:25.240> you<00:02:25.330> can

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
can use it if you prefer it but you can

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.720 
can use it if you prefer it but you can
use<00:02:25.600> re<00:02:25.810> any<00:02:26.020> gun<00:02:26.260> but<00:02:26.440> ever<00:02:26.590> guns<00:02:26.890> i<00:02:27.130> actually

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
use re any gun but ever guns i actually

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.570 
use re any gun but ever guns i actually
suggest<00:02:28.360> using<00:02:28.720> because<00:02:29.140> it<00:02:29.560> holds<00:02:29.980> a<00:02:30.280> lot<00:02:30.310> of

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
suggest using because it holds a lot of

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.630 
suggest using because it holds a lot of
ammo<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:31.209> you<00:02:31.959> know<00:02:32.140> more<00:02:32.830> debt<00:02:33.070> more<00:02:33.220> but

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
ammo and you know more debt more but

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.710 
ammo and you know more debt more but
it's<00:02:33.760> effective<00:02:34.530> so<00:02:35.530> we<00:02:36.160> won't<00:02:36.280> do<00:02:36.580> is<00:02:37.090> like<00:02:37.600> i

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
it's effective so we won't do is like i

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.360 
it's effective so we won't do is like i

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.850 
ambush you right in front of you again
so<00:03:34.390> basically<00:03:35.019> you<00:03:35.290> make<00:03:35.470> sure<00:03:35.680> they're

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
so basically you make sure they're

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.590 
so basically you make sure they're
zombies<00:03:35.920> are<00:03:36.190> right<00:03:36.370> behind<00:03:36.519> you<00:03:36.940> not<00:03:37.329> too

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
zombies are right behind you not too

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.390 
zombies are right behind you not too
closely<00:03:37.930> they<00:03:38.230> can<00:03:38.440> kill<00:03:38.650> you<00:03:38.799> but<00:03:39.070> you<00:03:39.280> know

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
closely they can kill you but you know

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.430 
closely they can kill you but you know
close<00:03:39.730> enough<00:03:40.030> so<00:03:40.329> when<00:03:40.630> you<00:03:40.750> run<00:03:40.959> right<00:03:41.200> round

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
close enough so when you run right round

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.830 
close enough so when you run right round
