00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello here roman the decoder of no 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.480
 verbal I am delighted to find you 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.090
 in the series a day a gesture and in this 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.010
 moment we talk about the myths around the 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.019
 verbal communication these things that 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.139
 we believe true and yet who have not 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.250
 not yet demonstrated any of these 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.800
 things we are going to talk about today 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.150
 it's the hemisphere is it and cerebral 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.550
 I'm happy I managed to say it in 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.619
 once that is what it consists of 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.939
 simply to dissociate the brain 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.460
 in two hemispheres so the brain 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.929
 left and right brain and tell each other 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.700
 that they have a different function and 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.860
 that each of them how of a 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.239
 body part etc according to the 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.160
 left brain of the right brain is going 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.390
 interpret the gesture differently 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.420
 the right hand I'm really trying to 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.899
 left then on the one hand I would like you 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.489
 to say one thing 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.649
 there are studies that have been conducted 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.600
 precisely on to find out if the 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.520
 left brain function were 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.750
 more related to all that is rational 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.430
 everything that is calculating 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.170
 and then the right brain every 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.280
 creative who is emotional and 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.980
 studies that have been conducted on this 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.100
 that they were very stigmatized very 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.899
 generalized because I think and s was 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.140
 interesting about a certain principle for 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.510
 there is for 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.460
 of teaching except that by digging well 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.250
 the studies that really shows it 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.869
 are very scattered and finally I have 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.790
 not found that suited me after 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.990
 other things that have been associated with 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.400
 its that is to say that beyond 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.060
 brain function knows how 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.350
 the left or right brain control the 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.910
 right side or left side ie 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.560
 what do some nonverbal theories do 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.330
 if we use the right hand it's up to 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.350
 to say that they used etc finally we 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.520
 does the same moves to the left 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.090
 or right know different 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.550
 meanings 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.590
 I never went back to this 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.909
 through there because simply he 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.420
 there are no scientific resources 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.430
 on the subject and that it becomes very very 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.690
 complicated if we start studying the 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.369
 gesture of a right mast of the gesture 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.530
 of the shit elsewhere if there are 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.880
 people who have reliable resources at this 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.100
 topic post it in the comments 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.560
 because I have never found anything 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.580
 such in on the subject also for that that 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.780
 I never talk about it 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.280
 I tend to always talk about 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.020
 things that have been validated 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.070
 scientifically that I was able to test this 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.630
 kind of things has not been validated 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.020
 scientifically he 's never been able to 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.170
 test 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.800
 also so there is this sow right side 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.210
 left side 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.390
 used in the gestures we also speak 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.220
 look to the right hard hardly to the left 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.380
 which would have different meanings 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.570
 it is used a lot in pnl in particular 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.440
 it's the same thing I take 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.410
 with tweezers 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.720
 simply because I had my 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.730
 customers who said to me here I am me 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.530
 I can spot the lie in 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.150
 looking right or left and I 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.650
 said ok maybe tia rim what's it 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.239
 it's a chance in two because you 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.320
 look at the person look right on 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.720
 look left at a chance on two 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.660
 you are good and in addition after there is the 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.040
 myth that in function if one is right handed 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.310
 or are left - handers it has changed some 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.110
 thing 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.810
 and in the end we get lost completely 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.120
 so me my advice if you read some 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.310
 stuff if you have things around 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.350
 the hemisphere is quoted cerebrally and on 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.489
 how does a left hemisphere or 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.170
 the right hemisphere to control from 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.750
 different way 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.930
 the emotional rational aspect through the 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.190
 gesture leave that to one side 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.590
 certainly a motor weight the 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.540
 the left brain and serves right 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.670
 control the reverse part of the body 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.100
 but from an interpretation point of view 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.390
 gesture behind really take that 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.710
 with tweezers and did not come back there 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.420
 in because in my opinion it's 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.400
 really a communication myth 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.650
 nonverbal and I would like this 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.770
 myth remains a myth is not used 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.540
 by your care that's it for this new 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.040
 episode of the series a day a gesture if 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.710
 by the next video you want 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.060
 to follow and continue your 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.390
 learning communication no 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.680
 verbal I simply invite you to 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.330
 follow the express training of the decoder 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.710
 say nonverbal by clicking on the link 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.340
 which will appear on the screen I tell you 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.340
 see you soon
