00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.630
 year 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.000
 I traveled to heaven 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.670
 talking about intelligent life of course who 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.480
 It's smart if it was a good interview. 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.090
 given the space there is no intelligent life 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.600
 need to have arrived in space she can 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.160
 to have been born there and to be 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.610
 smarter had not thought of 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.470
 maceio 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.570
 Do you think I think there is life? 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.780
 intelligent another planet what the 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.140
 science already knows is that if there 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.580
 intelligent life and if it happens to us 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.580
 send a message 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.680
 this message would take hundreds of years 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.449
 to reach us 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.760
 If somebody sends you a message 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.580
 Pedro maybe only his great-grandson would receive 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.940
 You keep talking about something that God 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.530
 free me and save are losing the most 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.520
 party in the sky 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.729
 This time it 's the tactic of stars. 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.729
 same 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:44.930
 How beautiful is the new moon night? 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:49.130
 you can see thousands of stars and 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:52.210
 constellations and pregnant everything okay but 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.200
 To console only then I come 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.650
 family constellations 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.970
 are groups of stars that receive names 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.430
 constellation of the largest constellation of the 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.550
 southern cruise because the constellations 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.490
 are given this name because astronomers 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.100
 who study space are men of great 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.750
 imagination they connect the stars with 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.120
 an imaginary line forming figures 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.580
 which name the constellations equal to 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.310
 constellation wig of berenice 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.940
 You tell me the other day, do not you? 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:25.400
 exactly is a constellation with 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.180
 the very romantic name 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.280
 It's such a beautiful story that it's the 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.540
 Story is even more beautiful, lady. 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.200
 told us 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.080
 Kiss was a princess 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.549
 married to my study of the great 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.500
 luge kings 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:48.230
 he was beautiful and grandma she was beautiful and 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:54.350
 had more beautiful hair than one has 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:57.980
 news once while Ptolemy part 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:01.610
 an expedition in the war against Syria 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:05.120
 the princess erenice taken of fear did 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:08.360
 a promise to god to venus i knew 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.390
 If I return, I'm victorious. 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.560
 terrible battle I come down and if mine 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.070
 hair 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:19.560
 the Ptolemaic king returned victorious and 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:22.980
 princess berenice fulfilled her promise 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:27.030
 cut the hair delivered to us in the temple 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:30.440
 of the Mayan goddess the next day erenice 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:33.390
 took a stretch his hair 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.580
 disappeared from the defendant 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.510
 the astronomer who had just 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:42.660
 discover a new group of stars 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:46.500
 he sent word to the king that the hair of 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:50.069
 berenice were in the sky and that 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:54.510
 formed a constellation that began to 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:58.170
 call wig comics star wars 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.340
 lumumba and that radio and covers the details 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.630
 of space 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:12.120
 to want is power is only you to make one 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:17.000
 telescope they cláudio gama my son 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.000
 treat yourself to one as one thousand light today 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:27.240
 unlikely 23 cesium is a nebula 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:30.060
 there is not now my son if what we are 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:35.030
 seeing it was a nebula would have to 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:37.830
 present clear stains doctor jeff 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:41.040
 to be a cluster nimbos must have 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.090
 Ice crystals form is is wide and 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.190
 thunder 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:50.820
 now my son range 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:54.410
 definitely one as the members do 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:05:01.770
 cesium is definitely a nebula and 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:04.110
 nor will they spend the clearest night of the year 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:08.670
 measured forces have forgotten the rent of this 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:10.920
 telescope cost us a fair fortune 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.080
 What brings us here is a very 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:16.760
 more important than all clusters 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:20.210
 nimbos and nebula together is not true 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.210
 the work 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.630
 he imagined it was a result 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:39.910
 pirate of the bush 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:42.960
 it was what I wanted 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.960
 what a dreamer 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:51.169
 he believed that he never bought any 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:51.169
 I was on the ball 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.240
 because you are a dreamer 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.770
 everything you have chosen is like a castle 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.770
 chin 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.770
 is 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.159
 the telescope came out of the astronomical telescope 

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:22.240
 invented by Galileo a great sage 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:25.879
 Italian what I say only one poster 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.780
 invention is only to give the paths of 

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:30.229
 bamboo 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.310
 evoking the lenses inside looks easy 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:33.080
 because everyone today knows more 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.669
 Millions of years have passed since the 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.550
 humanity has experienced this 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:39.889
 simple to see the world continues 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.750
 being easy was using food and 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:43.430
 the economic Telescope grandmother 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.360
 Galileo concluded that the earth was 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.930
 around the sun 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:50.960
 so Galileo was almost burned alive 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.969
 Then, because of this discovery, 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.860
 ignorance this did not interest 

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:58.759
 who took care of the great flock that 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:07:02.530
 it's burned alive alive 

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:02.530
 it's impossible to imagine what this is 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.629
 in the middle ages 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.969
 thousands of people were burned and 

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:12.919
 only because they saw more of the 

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:30.740
 the others and tried to teach what 

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:33.879
 knew the ignorant that the telescope 

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:38.870
 It is ready and now we will see 

00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:42.229
 at this time just to see the sun standing all 

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:44.930
 folgadão slipper 20 earth rotating 

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:48.169
 around right well the best reason 

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:56.750
 We have to wait for dusk to wait. 

00:07:48.169 --> 00:08:03.279
 spiral that touches the truth banana 

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:03.279
 everything was
