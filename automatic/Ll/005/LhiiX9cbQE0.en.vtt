00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
color cosmic and as you can see it's a

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.750 
color cosmic and as you can see it's a
little<00:02:42.810> more<00:02:43.260> sparkly<00:02:44.010> than<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.519> others

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
little more sparkly than the others

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.490 
little more sparkly than the others
which<00:02:45.000> I<00:02:45.150> really<00:02:45.329> didn't<00:02:45.810> know<00:02:45.840> that<00:02:46.230> this<00:02:46.319> one

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
which I really didn't know that this one

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.770 
which I really didn't know that this one
was<00:02:46.560> going<00:02:46.799> sparkly<00:02:47.280> so<00:02:47.819> I<00:02:47.849> hope<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.299> sparkles

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
was going sparkly so I hope the sparkles

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.140 
was going sparkly so I hope the sparkles
don't<00:02:48.959> show<00:02:49.170> up<00:02:49.410> as<00:02:49.590> much<00:02:49.860> on<00:02:50.069> my<00:02:50.160> lips<00:02:50.370> I'm<00:02:50.819> not

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
don't show up as much on my lips I'm not

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.539 
don't show up as much on my lips I'm not
really<00:02:51.299> a<00:02:51.390> glittery<00:02:51.810> fan<00:02:52.109> but<00:02:52.549> hopefully

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
really a glittery fan but hopefully

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.130 
really a glittery fan but hopefully
it'll<00:02:53.670> work<00:02:53.760> out<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.269> then<00:02:54.359> this<00:02:54.599> one<00:02:54.660> is<00:02:54.840> in

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
it'll work out and then this one is in

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.960 
it'll work out and then this one is in
the<00:02:55.290> color<00:02:55.470> Oasis<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:56.400> think<00:02:56.640> this<00:02:56.790> one

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
the color Oasis and I think this one

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.430 
the color Oasis and I think this one
will<00:02:57.030> be<00:02:57.180> my<00:02:57.299> absolute<00:02:57.480> favorite<00:02:58.140> because<00:02:58.260> it

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
will be my absolute favorite because it

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.080 
will be my absolute favorite because it
looks<00:02:58.620> more<00:02:58.859> of<00:02:59.099> a<00:02:59.190> nude<00:02:59.459> color<00:02:59.730> than<00:03:00.060> the

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
looks more of a nude color than the

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.180 
looks more of a nude color than the
other<00:03:00.329> one<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:00.750> don't<00:03:01.440> ask<00:03:01.530> my<00:03:01.769> personal

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.280 
other one I don't ask my personal
opinion<00:03:02.489> but<00:03:02.730> I'm<00:03:03.269> really<00:03:03.569> excited<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.170> this

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
will add to my lip connection okay and

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.920
