00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.040 
that sort of looks nice and here trying
to<00:00:36.270> close<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.899> was<00:00:37.110> it

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
to close that was it

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.220 
to close that was it
this<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.230> close-up<00:00:40.530> look<00:00:40.890> at<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.219> booster

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
this is a close-up look at this booster

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.799 
this is a close-up look at this booster
and<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.160> underneath<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.879> the

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
and it this is the underneath and the

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.959 
and it this is the underneath and the
master<00:00:46.260> cylinder<00:00:46.469> has<00:00:47.010> been<00:00:47.250> replaced<00:00:47.579> but

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
master cylinder has been replaced but

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.150 
master cylinder has been replaced but
the<00:00:48.030> old<00:00:48.239> one<00:00:48.450> obviously<00:00:49.050> leaked<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.590> hell<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:49.950> a

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
the old one obviously leaked a hell of a

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.270 
the old one obviously leaked a hell of a
lot<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.610> fluid<00:00:51.030> onto<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:52.010> because<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.039> is

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
lot of fluid onto this because that is

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.939 
lot of fluid onto this because that is
just<00:00:53.730> bad<00:00:55.789> so<00:00:56.789> what<00:00:56.969> I'll<00:00:57.090> do<00:00:57.360> why<00:00:58.350> we'll<00:00:58.680> all

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
just bad so what I'll do why we'll all

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.790 
just bad so what I'll do why we'll all
this<00:00:59.219> up<00:00:59.570> pretty<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:00.719> pretty<00:01:01.289> much<00:01:01.500> needs<00:01:01.710> a

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
this up pretty on pretty much needs a

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.329 
this up pretty on pretty much needs a
sand<00:01:02.100> blast<00:01:02.750> now<00:01:03.750> why<00:01:03.960> will<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.320> paint<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.159> up

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
sand blast now why will it paint it up

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.950 
sand blast now why will it paint it up
if<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:06.000> hasn't<00:01:06.240> got<00:01:06.330> any<00:01:06.510> holes<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:08.960> fit

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
if it hasn't got any holes in it and fit

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.899 
if it hasn't got any holes in it and fit
it<00:01:10.080> up<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.439> other<00:01:10.560> currency<00:01:11.189> how<00:01:11.490> long<00:01:11.760> it

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
it up to the other currency how long it

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.740 
it up to the other currency how long it
lasts<00:01:12.360> but<00:01:13.760> I<00:01:14.760> think<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.090> boost<00:01:15.390> has<00:01:15.540> got

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
lasts but I think this boost has got

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.929 
lasts but I think this boost has got
about<00:01:15.960> six<00:01:16.320> hundred<00:01:16.409> thousand<00:01:17.220> kilometers<00:01:17.340> on

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
about six hundred thousand kilometers on

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.160 
about six hundred thousand kilometers on
it<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:19.280> yeah<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:21.150> when<00:01:21.299> we<00:01:21.420> put<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> fresh

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
it so yeah and when we put it to a fresh

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.740 
it so yeah and when we put it to a fresh
engine<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:23.250> vacuum<00:01:23.670> might<00:01:23.850> be<00:01:24.000> too<00:01:24.180> much<00:01:24.390> for

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
engine the vacuum might be too much for

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.880 
engine the vacuum might be too much for
it<00:01:24.840> might<00:01:25.880> fail<00:01:26.880> straightaway<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:28.409> might<00:01:28.650> last

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
it might fail straightaway it might last

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.080 
it might fail straightaway it might last
it<00:01:29.820> let's<00:01:30.509> see

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.969 

Oh<00:01:34.119> about<00:01:34.990> that<00:01:35.320> when<00:01:35.439> it<00:01:35.530> came<00:01:35.680> out<00:01:35.829> pretty

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
Oh about that when it came out pretty

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.340 
Oh about that when it came out pretty
good<00:01:36.549> now<00:01:36.850> just<00:01:37.119> prep<00:01:37.360> wash<00:01:37.540> it<00:01:37.750> and<00:01:37.869> paint<00:01:38.170> it

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
good now just prep wash it and paint it

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.770 
good now just prep wash it and paint it
and<00:01:38.560> hope<00:01:39.520> it<00:01:39.729> works<00:01:39.909> really<00:01:40.240> well<00:01:42.539> now<00:01:43.539> that

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
and hope it works really well now that

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.230 
and hope it works really well now that
came<00:01:44.049> up<00:01:44.259> pretty<00:01:44.500> good<00:01:44.729> actually<00:01:45.729> see<00:01:46.090> what

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
came up pretty good actually see what

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.710 
came up pretty good actually see what
brand<00:01:46.509> it<00:01:46.689> is<00:01:46.810> man<00:01:47.189> bebe<00:01:48.189> uh<00:01:50.399> yeah<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:52.509> looks

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
brand it is man bebe uh yeah that looks

all right

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.710 
all right
hopefully<00:01:53.979> it<00:01:54.100> works<00:01:54.250> for<00:01:54.880> more<00:01:55.360> than<00:01:55.509> ten

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
hopefully it works for more than ten

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:03.679 
hopefully it works for more than ten
minutes<00:01:57.000> yes<00:01:58.000> much<00:01:58.450> better<00:01:58.689> than<00:01:58.869> it<00:01:58.960> was<00:01:59.140> oh

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.330 

no<00:02:04.689> I<00:02:04.720> got<00:02:04.899> this<00:02:05.049> count<00:02:05.350> here<00:02:05.590> so<00:02:06.009> now<00:02:06.159> I<00:02:06.190> can

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
no I got this count here so now I can

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.649 
no I got this count here so now I can
swap<00:02:06.549> the<00:02:06.700> booster<00:02:07.090> onto<00:02:07.360> it

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
swap the booster onto it

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.139 
swap the booster onto it
this<00:02:08.410> one's<00:02:08.649> failed<00:02:09.310> it's<00:02:09.850> still<00:02:10.000> actually

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
this one's failed it's still actually

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.780 
this one's failed it's still actually
works<00:02:10.539> it's<00:02:10.869> leaking<00:02:11.260> in<00:02:11.380> off<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.560> lot<00:02:11.920> so<00:02:12.670> the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
works it's leaking in off the lot so the

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.470 
works it's leaking in off the lot so the
engines<00:02:13.150> running<00:02:13.930> too<00:02:14.170> lean<00:02:14.440> at<00:02:14.769> idle<00:02:15.480> so

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
engines running too lean at idle so

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.250 
engines running too lean at idle so
let's<00:02:17.110> put<00:02:17.290> that<00:02:17.319> other<00:02:17.709> booster<00:02:18.280> on<00:02:19.019> its<00:02:20.019> own

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
let's put that other booster on its own

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.289 
let's put that other booster on its own
overall<00:02:21.190> this<00:02:21.340> car<00:02:21.549> is<00:02:21.670> actually<00:02:21.819> in<00:02:22.060> very

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
overall this car is actually in very

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.130 
overall this car is actually in very
good<00:02:22.510> condition<00:02:23.019> really<00:02:23.920> nice<00:02:24.099> so<00:02:25.090> so<00:02:25.870> eager

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
good condition really nice so so eager

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.470 
good condition really nice so so eager
to<00:02:26.170> put<00:02:26.380> a<00:02:26.410> nice-looking<00:02:26.950> booster<00:02:27.370> in<00:02:27.459> so<00:02:28.420> I

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
to put a nice-looking booster in so I
