00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:03.850
 I suppose. 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.850
 I have all the trees that I supply. 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.399
 Infinite Reproduction Humanities 

00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:13.399
 Because I needed more time 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.509
 'With a record of 10 minutes in Tokyo 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.220
 there is mainly 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.759
 ok 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.759
 I think I will. 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.090
 And that's right for that 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.570
 steven 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.050
 I have a lot of ox quizzes to watch 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.240
 and 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.240
 I did it all based on that sketch 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.450
 Using the Moon plan map, 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.720
 Would it be great to try 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.980
 Limited wool cream is so good 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.080
 I do not want to draw a big machine 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.340
 Informative 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.290
 ub12 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.490
 Change to eg. 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.450
 The new golf 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.440
 That way. 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.490
 Well. 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.380
 control 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.560
 Announcement 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.560
 In the end, 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.390
 Change this way. 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.520
 If you look at the state at all six days 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.980
 These overturned parents are 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.610
 I can not draw a picture 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.490
 Lose everything 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.680
 For example, 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.970
 Kim Dong-ju's research on the cheap side 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.880
 I'm so sorry. 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.880
 I can still figure it out, especially for 10 years 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.030
 Let's try the sketch. 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.610
 To feel the sketch for a while 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.960
 Not much 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.130
 patrick also offer flute 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.820
 By word of mouth 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.300
 The picture is well packed. 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.420
 Or something like this 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.680
 mma stay in and out of aunt 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.459
 Photo equipment 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.579
 It's not like that because it's like Kimpo. 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.049
 Not even 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.449

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:22.389

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:24.699
 Just what is this 

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:27.699
 Only that there is 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.919
 You know 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:34.919
 Kim Moon-il's old character 

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:39.649
 6. 

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:42.289
 Accra Biotechnology 

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:45.299
 The cause was a big increase in 10 goals 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.109
 The goal is to have a cuddle through the year 2 0 

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:53.079
 Pictures 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.289
 I could use more. 

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:59.289
 osenburg 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.829
 Karin is not a tool and a tokai. 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.760
 Therefore, capsule acceleration 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.479
 Background from factory 

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:16.479
 I can confirm that. 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:22.169
 If the object is acrylic 

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:27.249
 Let's do it. 

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:30.029
 It looks like a double wave. 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:33.029
 Unfinished ceremony 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.989
 Rent a helmet that looks like it would look like 

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:47.979
 I do not think so. 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:56.019
 Modeling 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.309
 You're doing it. 

00:03:57.309 --> 00:04:00.529
 I'm as good as I am. 

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:03.529
 Did you think so 

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:10.179

 Middlesbrough, England 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:26.289
 Part 5 is a little difficult. 

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:30.069
 You can only think of it as a sketch of admiration. 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.069
 Green and Green 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:35.990
 That part is 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.719
 A hostel newspaper 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:39.830
 my feet 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.419
 It's like infiltration. 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.159
 Minko 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:48.219
 There are few cases like this, 

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:49.699
 Hana Tour 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:52.699
 I think I'll get better. 

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:57.240
 The reason I drew 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.139
 Create co. 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:02.259
 Anybody 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:03.680
 Just like that 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.680
 I'm having a lot of trouble 

00:05:07.239 --> 00:05:08.129
 While simple 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:10.460
 Have a lot of features 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.809
 together 

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:15.809
 A goalkeeper who could do it. But 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.849
 And 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:22.610
 A weapon 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.610
 I do not think so. 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.430
 not. Price drop 

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:39.809
 Show me the club 

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:17.439
 I need to leave my country. 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:21.129
 At a level like this 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:23.660
 Avoid Murdoch 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.680
 That's high tech. 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.680
 Do not expect big 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.110
 What 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.110

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:58.259
 Honam University 

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:01.259
 You worry. 

00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:10.879
 Briggs fixed is an excuse. 

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:13.619
 So I am 

00:07:13.619 --> 00:07:15.409
 Then, for a while, 

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:17.029
 Festival modeled 

00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:18.559
