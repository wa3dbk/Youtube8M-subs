base plate all the way through the
bottom<00:01:40.350> just<00:01:40.590> for<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> lot<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.100> stability<00:01:41.310> on

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
bottom just for a lot of stability on

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.880 
bottom just for a lot of stability on
there<00:01:41.909> with<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.659> nice<00:01:42.810> lightweight<00:01:43.170> high<00:01:43.649> back

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
there with a nice lightweight high back

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.080 
there with a nice lightweight high back
coming<00:01:44.520> at<00:01:44.700> jump<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.180> then<00:01:46.220> on<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.399> bottom<00:01:47.549> we

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
coming at jump and then on the bottom we

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.200 
coming at jump and then on the bottom we
actually<00:01:48.390> have<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.540> pad<00:01:48.780> here<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.850> come<00:01:50.850> can

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
actually have a pad here that come can

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.340 
actually have a pad here that come can
come<00:01:51.240> off<00:01:51.479> if<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.750> need<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:51.990> but<00:01:52.079> it's<00:01:52.229> really

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
come off if you need it but it's really

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.450 
come off if you need it but it's really
nice<00:01:52.530> because<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.890> adds<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.130> little<00:01:53.220> bit<00:01:53.340> of

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
nice because it adds a little bit of

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.030 
nice because it adds a little bit of
extra<00:01:53.729> cushion<00:01:54.119> on<00:01:54.240> there<00:01:54.810> for<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.619> it's<00:01:55.829> a

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
extra cushion on there for you so it's a

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.069 
extra cushion on there for you so it's a
dampening<00:01:57.030> effect<00:01:57.180> when<00:01:57.570> you're<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:57.960> know

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
dampening effect when you're you know

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.200 
dampening effect when you're you know
landing<00:01:58.500> off<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.619> big<00:01:58.890> jumps<00:01:59.310> or<00:01:59.460> coming<00:02:00.090> down

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
landing off a big jumps or coming down

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.940 
landing off a big jumps or coming down
really<00:02:00.360> hard<00:02:00.509> on<00:02:00.750> your<00:02:00.899> bindings<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.380> lessens

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
really hard on your bindings it lessens

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.859 
really hard on your bindings it lessens
the<00:02:02.009> chatter<00:02:02.340> they're<00:02:02.640> also<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.360> toe<00:02:03.659> ramp

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
the chatter they're also the toe ramp

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.630 
the chatter they're also the toe ramp
here<00:02:04.140> can<00:02:04.590> pull<00:02:04.829> out<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.009> little<00:02:05.250> bit<00:02:05.399> further

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
here can pull out a little bit further

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.039 
here can pull out a little bit further
so<00:02:05.850> for<00:02:06.119> those<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.420> with<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.540> bigger<00:02:06.780> feet

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
so for those of you with the bigger feet

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.449 
so for those of you with the bigger feet
you<00:02:07.469> don't<00:02:07.619> have<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.799> worry<00:02:07.950> about<00:02:08.039> any<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.369> the

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
you don't have to worry about any of the

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.389 
you don't have to worry about any of the
gapping<00:02:08.700> between<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.420> board<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:09.780> your

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
gapping between the board and your

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.500 
gapping between the board and your
binding<00:02:10.700> there<00:02:11.709> like<00:02:12.709> I<00:02:12.799> was<00:02:12.890> saying<00:02:13.390> it's<00:02:14.390> a

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
binding there like I was saying it's a

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.690 
binding there like I was saying it's a
good<00:02:14.659> binding<00:02:14.989> overall<00:02:15.379> a<00:02:15.680> nice<00:02:16.189> midline

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
good binding overall a nice midline

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.280 
good binding overall a nice midline
intermediate<00:02:17.329> binding<00:02:17.689> we<00:02:17.840> got<00:02:17.989> in<00:02:18.110> two

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
intermediate binding we got in two

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.839 
intermediate binding we got in two
different<00:02:18.470> colors<00:02:18.890> with<00:02:19.370> it<00:02:19.489> here<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:19.790> the

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849

and<00:02:21.769> blue<00:02:21.950> and<00:02:22.129> then<00:02:22.730> also<00:02:23.150> a<00:02:23.629> couple

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
and blue and then also a couple

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.720 
and blue and then also a couple
different<00:02:24.230> sizes<00:02:24.799> a<00:02:24.829> small<00:02:25.129> medium<00:02:25.310> fits

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
different sizes a small medium fits

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.380 
different sizes a small medium fits
about<00:02:25.849> a<00:02:26.180> five<00:02:26.659> or<00:02:26.689> six<00:02:27.140> to<00:02:27.459> nine<00:02:28.459> and<00:02:28.819> then<00:02:29.239> the

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
about a five or six to nine and then the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.080 
about a five or six to nine and then the
large<00:02:29.599> XL<00:02:30.079> is<00:02:30.230> going<00:02:30.709> to<00:02:30.769> be<00:02:30.829> more<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.220> common

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
large XL is going to be more the common

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.020 
large XL is going to be more the common
fit<00:02:32.390> inside<00:02:32.569> men's<00:02:33.079> size<00:02:33.290> nine<00:02:33.590> to<00:02:33.890> a<00:02:33.920> 14<00:02:34.459> so

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
fit inside men's size nine to a 14 so

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.989 
fit inside men's size nine to a 14 so
that's<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.659> Rome<00:02:36.670> s90<00:02:37.670> 2011<00:02:38.480> binding<00:02:38.780> fire
