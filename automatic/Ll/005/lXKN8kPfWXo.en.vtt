 pandoro and sparkling wine

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.590
 the heart 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.940
 Scotland are expensive 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.380
 and kill the breath before Christmas 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:58.960

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:06.340
 is the bathroom there was then we are again 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.820
 together to celebrate Christmas with 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.369
 you 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.490
 you've seen comic sketches so far 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.050
 inspired by your sentences and 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.119
 later however you will see which one for 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.920
 we hope for you too the true 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.500
 essence of Christmas 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.970
 you will also see mini tutorials that 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.680
 several we thought of 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.619
 accomplish this for this Christmas 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.320
 small ideas so we hope that 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.960
 I like you at all we wish you good 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.229
 from Christmas to red I do and leave the 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.340
 video 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:39.070
 hello the magic of a smile tenderness 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.550
 of a caress the sweetness of a 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:45.890
 I essentially embrace this for us 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:48.220
 Christmas and for you 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.220
 Yup 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.470
 but after this intractable we can 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.210
 immediately to the make up tutorial 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.250
 start eye makeup immediately 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.050
 applying a very bright premier 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.700
 on the mobile eyelid that 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.550
 then I go to blend with a 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.440
 small brush is slightly in the 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.140
 fold with your fingers then take 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.030
 a mixture of cold and warm brown 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.440
 and liszt como in the fold lengthen 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.340
 slightly the shape of my eye 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.340
 towards the outer corner 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.760
 only beyond the crease of the eye I go then 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.580
 to spread more only the 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.440
 I like the warm coloring of the margone 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.990
 very much the contrast you go to 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.610
 create with cold brown only in the 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.070
 eye bend later 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.260
 shaded with warm brown but after ad 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.660
 apply a lot of eye shadow 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.260
 luminous only on the mobile eyelid e 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.760
 immediately under my eyebrows 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.709
 later he took it with a 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.780
 brush and apply it throughout 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.220
 the lower part of the eye 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.590
 but then to use a concealer 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.890
 salmon-colored to correct mine 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.890
 eye bags 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.050
 and after blending it well with the 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.140
 fingers I go to get a gel but you can 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.270
 also use the wedding mascara 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.450
 transparent that I am going to apply to 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:09.390
 eyeliner shape over the eyelid 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.890
 mobile then use these glitter for 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.090
 the essence art of nail art 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.800
 really beautiful I choose these among the 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.290
 so many that are in the package 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.140
 and I apply them just where 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.670
 previously he spread the gel you will see 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.440
 that the three - dimensional effect they go 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.840
 to create these glitter on the eye and 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.760
 really fabulous later 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.500
 I choose to apply false eyelashes 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.620
 only and exclusively the external corner 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.150
 and to recreate a little cindy kg effect of the 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.010
 grinch I don't know if you know the 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.620
 child 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.239
 and then apply a mascara and finish 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.010
 eyelashes are better on the corner 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.930
 external and this and another eye la 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.760
 let's move on to the face make-up for which I have 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.439
 previously applied a base 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.720
 without fixing it with a powder because 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:54.959
 I want a very bright complexion 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.540
 I apply a blush caught on the cheeks and 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.970
 then a bit of illuminating 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.159
 leaving the base anyway much more 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.440
 natural compared to the eyes and to 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:07.769
 lips for which I choose one instead 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.250
 red shade that I apply above the 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:13.489
 correct lips with the concealer then 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:16.799
 as you can see , a red strawberry comes out 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:20.190
 very beautiful, much simpler 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.620
 sweet compared to classic red fire 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.440
 to finish I apply only to the center of the 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.960
 lips a very bright red gloss e 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.690
 fly this is the make to tell you i hope 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.610
 so you both liked girls here I am 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.669
 this time it's not the intro of the video but 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.310
 at the end and this time accompanied 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:41.310
 also from him Santa Claus who could not 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.889
 absolutely absolutely missing 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.240
 for this video for this year there 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.070
 I really wanted to end up like 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.990
 this video talked about because in spite of 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.380
 the intro in which together with pamela vi 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.270
 Merry Christmas to wish you wanted so much to 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.430
 so to tell you personally then 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.639
 for the many good wishes for this 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:04.139
 I hope Christmas brings at least serenity 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:07.050
 joy if not obviously many gifts o 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:10.979
 so much money those on a day like the 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.810
 Christmas I think count or not in the sense 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.250
 not only in my opinion the gifts itself that 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.039
 in fact, I never appreciated 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.330
 more meanwhile it is nice to see i anyway 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:20.460
 gifts and will sell, however, in my opinion the 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.580
 Christmas has a lot more meaning 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.800
 deep in the rediscovered sense 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.330
 with loved ones see your loved ones again 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.569
 after a long time being able to embrace them 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:32.090
 to be able to enjoy that of meaning 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:34.159
 deep of what in the end is the 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.530
 life that are not gifts but are one 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:39.530
 family the warmth of a sister of a 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.360
 brother of a grandmother of a grandfather I will 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:45.439
