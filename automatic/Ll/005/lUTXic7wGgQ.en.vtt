 Creams the range 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.530
 when I am more than two meters away from my team then I have 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.800
 a problem

 There are these Wallner Space Centers from different companies 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.520
 which are already relatively cheap have different functions on the one hand 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.360
 could the next slide 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.860
 last slide 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.480
 partly also this variant hereby percent 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.780
 Grade 2 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.430
 but it does not matter 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.680
 whether alcohol in alcoholic health has never July the 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.610

 three kilometers far one referred 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.530
 the route came 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.979
 but these indiscriminate present are relatively cheap in part you get 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.229
 the Schanz for 20 euros at some groceries - lean offer 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:52.840
 Has 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.670
 then you have such a thing in your hand and it can easily run around independently 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.490
 where is not so fixated on the keyboard 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.590
 Percent but what should not mislead to this title is perfect for this 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.240
 hardworking from the WOM and so counting under ten kilometers during the inflow 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.919
 about the power had gone with it 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:12.270
 Normally, but I am a bit way 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.739
 I can show something here 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.059
 I do not have it I have none 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:20.899
 They also buy from Logitech as a presenter 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:24.179
 Piece more in it then knowledge and Timo with it 

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:28.049
 With Bebra to us to standards, Dr I can feel a nice she invented 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.969
 for the time raised for Dubai lay five minutes of fame 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:34.849

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:41.329
 So here I can tell Tosar Stellmach groups how much time I've had 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:41.849
 beautiful 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.209
 spoken in one go 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.089
 when will it be time and effort again? 

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:48.219
 Fasting shows where people do that where people have been activated where people are 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.379
 discuss or whatever 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:51.870
 Here I have immediately under control 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.520
 It's usually like that when you talk about what's going on in the attack 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:58.679
 from Microsoft therefore would have in 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:02.879
 that has Microsoft Press Center Microsoft thus has a hybrid mouse which is both 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:03.999
 funny way 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:06.919
 On the one hand Maurus has to go to two press centers 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:09.529
 also very nice as an eternal variant 

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:11.699
 There are other gadgets 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:13.589
 there are ways out 

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:14.659
 like percent 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:16.949
 a protest due 

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:19.949
 The disc is well thought of by Russ 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.950
 to the iPod normally has a video output - even plan b I can 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:27.949
 my data is not just open usb-stick with only polls 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.389
 the great enthusiasm in Brno like Poland and SchÃ¤chter introduces in Studen 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:33.139
 running 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:37.699
 so of course also go to the iPod and there m3 per ton of presentation 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:40.699
 or with other devices that are simply in tension 

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:46.150
 if I also have to present a novel now it's up to the belly 

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:47.469

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:55.430
 and if I have to draw resignation now in Vermont then what can 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.659
 make sense 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:59.259
 to have a tablet 

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:01.919
 it could be russell that they advertising presentation what 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:03.659
 big in his markets 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.759
 and of course, Lever PC TuS Lammermoor are like that 

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:08.169
 react and work
