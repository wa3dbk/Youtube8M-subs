this<00:00:01.650> is<00:00:01.800> my<00:00:02.040> Tesla<00:00:02.460> coil<00:00:03.380> this<00:00:04.380> is<00:00:04.589> a<00:00:04.620> light<00:00:04.920> on

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
this is my Tesla coil this is a light on

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
I don't know em do that I might just use

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.509 
I don't know em do that I might just use

your<00:01:02.520> Aussie<00:01:02.879> you'll<00:01:03.000> know<00:01:03.180> Bunnings<00:01:03.719> yep

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
your Aussie you'll know Bunnings yep

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.940 
your Aussie you'll know Bunnings yep
picks<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.070> up<00:01:05.129> for<00:01:05.280> their<00:01:05.400> 15<00:01:05.820> bucks<00:01:06.710> yeah<00:01:07.710> and

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
picks it up for their 15 bucks yeah and

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.340 
picks it up for their 15 bucks yeah and
um<00:01:08.420> didn't<00:01:09.420> have<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.659> shortener<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.229> or

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
um didn't have to shortener it or

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.560 
um didn't have to shortener it or
anything<00:01:10.590> I'm<00:01:11.580> not<00:01:11.729> sure<00:01:11.790> if<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.210> need<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.450> get

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
anything I'm not sure if I need to get

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.210 
anything I'm not sure if I need to get
probably<00:01:13.020> something<00:01:13.320> with<00:01:13.439> thinner<00:01:14.030> and<00:01:15.030> I'm

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
probably something with thinner and I'm

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.330 
probably something with thinner and I'm
longer<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.549> get<00:01:17.790> more<00:01:17.970> turns<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:19.070> I<00:01:20.070> just

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
longer so I get more turns and I just

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.219 
longer so I get more turns and I just
like<00:01:20.549> someone<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.119> tell<00:01:21.540> me<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.840> and

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
like someone to tell me that that and

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.740 
like someone to tell me that that and
this<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.130> secondary<00:01:23.729> it's<00:01:24.030> 18<00:01:24.450> inches

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
this is the secondary it's 18 inches

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.010 
this is the secondary it's 18 inches
long<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:24.990> 2.5<00:01:25.290> inches<00:01:26.100> in<00:01:26.280> diameter<00:01:26.840> it<00:01:27.840> is

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
long and 2.5 inches in diameter it is

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.789 
long and 2.5 inches in diameter it is
Earth<00:01:28.320> at<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.860> bottom<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:30.229> at<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.350> top<00:01:31.560> it

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
Earth at the bottom and at the top it

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.679 
Earth at the bottom and at the top it
shoots<00:01:32.220> at<00:01:32.400> very<00:01:32.640> nice<00:01:32.880> stream<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.540> haven't

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
shoots at very nice stream is I haven't

shoots at very nice stream is I haven't
done<00:01:33.930> anything<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.470> change<00:01:35.159> IP<00:01:35.460> tuning<00:01:35.970> or

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
done anything to change IP tuning or

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.960 
done anything to change IP tuning or
anything<00:01:36.420> yet<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.380> just<00:01:37.590> how<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.640> so
