00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.749 
use a compass and you click on the item
so<00:01:52.350> they<00:01:52.439> don't<00:01:52.619> use<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.950> command<00:01:53.189> but<00:01:53.579> I

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
so they don't use the command but I

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.780 
so they don't use the command but I
still<00:01:54.090> would<00:01:55.219> recommend<00:01:56.219> doing<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:56.729> way

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
still would recommend doing it this way

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.560 
still would recommend doing it this way
with<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.329> username<00:01:57.659> being<00:01:58.110> this<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.570> then

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
with the username being this and then

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.359 
with the username being this and then
you<00:02:00.600> can<00:02:01.020> change<00:02:01.259> this<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:01.799> instead<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.100> saying

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
you can change this so instead of saying

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.039 
you can change this so instead of saying
you<00:02:02.549> can<00:02:02.759> connect<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.360> following<00:02:03.630> service

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
you can connect to the following service

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.800 
you can connect to the following service
you<00:02:04.259> can<00:02:04.409> change<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:05.040> um<00:02:07.190> like<00:02:08.209> log<00:02:09.209> the

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
you can change it to um like log the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.170 
you can change it to um like log the
server<00:02:10.020> name<00:02:10.110> network<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.190> then<00:02:11.340> servers<00:02:11.910> and

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
server name network and then servers and

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.000 
server name network and then servers and
then<00:02:12.360> right<00:02:13.290> here<00:02:13.319> is<00:02:13.590> the

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
then right here is the

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.550 
then right here is the
what<00:02:14.129> the<00:02:14.250> server<00:02:14.459> is<00:02:14.819> going<00:02:14.909> to<00:02:15.120> look<00:02:15.239> like<00:02:15.560> so

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
what the server is going to look like so

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.500 
what the server is going to look like so
if<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.189> want<00:02:17.370> this<00:02:17.519> to<00:02:17.670> be<00:02:17.760> golden<00:02:18.180> this<00:02:18.299> to<00:02:18.420> be

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
if you want this to be golden this to be

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.530 
if you want this to be golden this to be
red<00:02:18.750> you'll<00:02:19.260> see<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.560> difference<00:02:20.360> so<00:02:21.360> yeah

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
red you'll see the difference so yeah

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.380 
red you'll see the difference so yeah
