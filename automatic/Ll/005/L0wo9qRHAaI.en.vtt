have<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.949> bring<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.490> tremble<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:30.779> think<00:00:30.990> it's

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
have to bring a tremble in I think it's

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.590 
have to bring a tremble in I think it's
vitally<00:00:31.619> important<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.279> we<00:00:32.460> get<00:00:32.669> some<00:00:33.090> sort

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
vitally important that we get some sort

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.440 
vitally important that we get some sort
of<00:00:33.719> strength<00:00:34.530> on<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.829> wing<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.640> cope<00:00:35.969> with<00:00:36.270> the

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
of strength on the wing to cope with the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.810 
of strength on the wing to cope with the
Australian<00:00:37.110> wings<00:00:37.350> who<00:00:37.860> are<00:00:38.399> going<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.760> be

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
Australian wings who are going to be

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.540 
Australian wings who are going to be
receiving<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.660> lot<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.960> ball<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.440> attacking<00:00:41.129> us

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
receiving a lot of ball and attacking us

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.869 
receiving a lot of ball and attacking us
out<00:00:41.790> wide<00:00:42.180> hey<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.379> don't<00:00:43.829> think<00:00:44.129> girls<00:00:44.489> has

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
out wide hey I don't think girls has

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.420 
out wide hey I don't think girls has
played<00:00:45.210> well<00:00:45.539> enough<00:00:45.690> at<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:46.620> point<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:47.219> stay

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
played well enough at this point to stay

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.610 
played well enough at this point to stay
no<00:00:47.670> there's<00:00:47.940> Tommy<00:00:48.210> Bowe<00:00:48.539> for<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.320> matter

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
no there's Tommy Bowe for that matter

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.180 
no there's Tommy Bowe for that matter
and<00:00:50.129> he<00:00:50.520> looked<00:00:50.760> really<00:00:51.350> added<00:00:52.350> torch<00:00:52.680> hasn't

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
and he looked really added torch hasn't

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.459 
and he looked really added torch hasn't
had<00:00:53.370> enough<00:00:53.399> rugby<00:00:54.090> but<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.600> think<00:00:54.870> he<00:00:55.050> he

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
had enough rugby but I think he he

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.889 
had enough rugby but I think he he
offers<00:00:55.949> more<00:00:56.280> than<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.730> longer<00:00:57.090> term<00:00:57.360> the

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
offers more than the longer term the

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.560 
offers more than the longer term the
real<00:00:58.050> worry<00:00:58.320> now<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.430> centre's<00:00:59.940> this

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
real worry now is the centre's this

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.450 
real worry now is the centre's this
essentially<00:01:01.410> was<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.620> squad<00:01:02.010> who<00:01:02.190> came<00:01:02.430> down

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
essentially was a squad who came down

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.600 
essentially was a squad who came down
here<00:01:03.090> with<00:01:03.239> only<00:01:03.420> two<00:01:04.019> centers<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.860> now<00:01:05.339> we're

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
here with only two centers and now we're

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.700 
here with only two centers and now we're
discovering<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.750> neither<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.439> them<00:01:07.560> is

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
discovering that neither of them is

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.679 
discovering that neither of them is
playing<00:01:08.100> very<00:01:08.310> well<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.090> particular

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
playing very well and in particular

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.190 
playing very well and in particular
Gordon<00:01:10.140> D'Arcy<00:01:10.350> who<00:01:11.040> has<00:01:11.400> not<00:01:12.390> really<00:01:12.960> ever

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
Gordon D'Arcy who has not really ever

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.090 
Gordon D'Arcy who has not really ever
look<00:01:13.740> right<00:01:14.600> since<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.869> serious<00:01:16.619> injury

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
look right since that serious injury

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.880 
look right since that serious injury
Boris<00:01:17.549> stuck<00:01:17.909> with<00:01:18.119> them<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:19.080> therefore

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
Boris stuck with them and and therefore

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.800 
Boris stuck with them and and therefore
it's<00:01:20.100> crucial<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.790> we<00:01:20.909> have<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.210> Gaara<00:01:21.540> and

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
it's crucial that we have a Gaara and

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.499 
it's crucial that we have a Gaara and
fly-half<00:01:22.080> but<00:01:22.890> he's<00:01:23.070> gonna<00:01:23.280> control<00:01:23.939> again

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
fly-half but he's gonna control again

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.740 
fly-half but he's gonna control again
which<00:01:25.080> Sexton<00:01:25.710> has<00:01:25.979> not<00:01:26.369> done<00:01:26.729> Sexton<00:01:27.570> would

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
which Sexton has not done Sexton would

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.080 
which Sexton has not done Sexton would
put<00:01:28.020> far<00:01:28.409> more<00:01:28.710> pressure<00:01:29.100> on<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.970> players

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
put far more pressure on the players

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.749 
put far more pressure on the players
outside<00:01:30.540> them<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.079> think<00:01:31.140> Donald<00:01:31.680> ro-org<00:01:32.340> honor

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
outside them I think Donald ro-org honor

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.850 
outside them I think Donald ro-org honor
will<00:01:32.939> give<00:01:33.150> them<00:01:33.360> more<00:01:33.570> space<00:01:34.020> battle<00:01:34.590> passer

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
will give them more space battle passer

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.190 
will give them more space battle passer
but<00:01:35.520> more<00:01:35.759> importantly<00:01:36.329> for<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.659> whole<00:01:36.840> side

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
but more importantly for the whole side

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.890 
but more importantly for the whole side
capable<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:38.430> big<00:01:38.640> problem<00:01:38.880> for<00:01:39.210> kidney<00:01:39.600> is

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
capable the big problem for kidney is

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.749 
capable the big problem for kidney is
