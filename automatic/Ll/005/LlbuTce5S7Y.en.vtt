00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:20.449 
down to 199 so wanted a tablet with a 3G

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.120 
down to 199 so wanted a tablet with a 3G
capability<00:00:21.449> built<00:00:21.689> in<00:00:21.900> so<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.680> don't<00:00:22.769> have<00:00:22.949> to

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
capability built in so I don't have to

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.970 
capability built in so I don't have to
pay<00:00:23.310> my<00:00:23.519> phone<00:00:23.820> all<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.420> time<00:00:24.890> with<00:00:25.890> the

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980

pay my phone all the time with the
tablet<00:00:26.369> so<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.119> decided<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.750> take<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.080> plunge

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
tablet so I decided to take the plunge

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.560 
tablet so I decided to take the plunge
especially<00:00:28.980> because<00:00:29.130> HP<00:00:29.640> normally<00:00:30.390> means

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
especially because HP normally means

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.170 
especially because HP normally means
quality<00:00:31.130> also<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.700> thought<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.059> was<00:00:33.120> a

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
quality also so I thought it was a

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.010 
quality also so I thought it was a
bargain<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:34.079> I'm<00:00:34.710> going<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.100> go<00:00:35.250> through<00:00:36.020> my

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
bargain so I'm going to go through my

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.490 
bargain so I'm going to go through my
experience<00:00:37.649> after<00:00:37.920> 30<00:00:38.820> days<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.960> its

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.610 
the UK Android 4.2.2 so that's all the
positives<00:04:02.550> what<00:04:03.300> I<00:04:03.330> disliked<00:04:03.810> is<00:04:04.140> you<00:04:04.440> may

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
positives what I disliked is you may

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.590 
positives what I disliked is you may
have<00:04:04.650> noticed<00:04:05.220> it<00:04:05.340> as<00:04:05.520> I<00:04:05.670> move<00:04:05.940> the<00:04:06.150> tablet

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
have noticed it as I move the tablet

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.970 
have noticed it as I move the tablet
it's<00:04:07.760> prone<00:04:08.760> to<00:04:09.290> fingerprints<00:04:10.290> I<00:04:10.440> mean<00:04:10.770> the

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
it's prone to fingerprints I mean the

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.540 
it's prone to fingerprints I mean the
marks<00:04:11.550> if<00:04:11.940> you<00:04:12.000> if<00:04:12.420> I<00:04:12.570> angle<00:04:13.080> it<00:04:13.230> a<00:04:13.500> bit<00:04:14.310> you

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
marks if you if I angle it a bit you

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:21.830 
marks if you if I angle it a bit you
will<00:04:15.030> probably<00:04:15.420> see<00:04:15.840> a<00:04:16.109> lot<00:04:17.010> of<00:04:18.320> marks<00:04:20.480> on<00:04:21.480> it

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
will probably see a lot of marks on it

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.020 
will probably see a lot of marks on it
so<00:04:22.380> that's<00:04:22.650> you<00:04:23.010> have<00:04:23.310> to<00:04:23.460> spend<00:04:23.700> a<00:04:23.760> lot<00:04:23.880> of

so that's you have to spend a lot of

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.320 
so that's you have to spend a lot of
mean<00:04:24.450> a<00:04:24.540> lot<00:04:24.750> of<00:04:24.780> time<00:04:25.020> cleaning<00:04:25.620> it

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
mean a lot of time cleaning it

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.659
