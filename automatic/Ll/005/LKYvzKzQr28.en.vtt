00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.330 

Mexico's<00:00:00.359> project<00:00:00.780> today<00:00:01.020> I<00:00:01.560> just<00:00:01.770> wanted<00:00:02.250> to

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
Mexico's project today I just wanted to

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.470 
Mexico's project today I just wanted to
go<00:00:02.460> over<00:00:02.659> how<00:00:03.659> you<00:00:03.689> can<00:00:04.049> get<00:00:04.170> most<00:00:04.680> tires<00:00:05.480> on

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
go over how you can get most tires on

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.190 
go over how you can get most tires on
and<00:00:06.779> off<00:00:06.930> without<00:00:07.350> a<00:00:08.130> tire<00:00:08.700> leverage<00:00:09.200> so

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
and off without a tire leverage so

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.870 
and off without a tire leverage so
there's<00:00:10.349> definitely<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.650> technique<00:00:11.010> that<00:00:11.040> sort

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
there's definitely a technique that sort

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.490 
there's definitely a technique that sort
of<00:00:11.969> lets<00:00:12.120> you<00:00:12.210> get<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.389> little<00:00:12.509> more<00:00:12.719> slack<00:00:13.080> and

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
of lets you get a little more slack and

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.630 
of lets you get a little more slack and
let<00:00:14.309> you<00:00:14.429> get<00:00:14.549> that<00:00:14.670> tire<00:00:15.000> on<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.139> off<00:00:16.550> with<00:00:17.550> a

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
let you get that tire on and off with a

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.830 
let you get that tire on and off with a
little<00:00:17.760> less<00:00:18.000> headache<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.539> if<00:00:18.600> you<00:00:18.690> can

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
little less headache and if you can

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.240 
little less headache and if you can
start<00:00:19.050> riding<00:00:19.710> what<00:00:19.859> they're<00:00:19.980> having<00:00:20.039> to

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
start riding what they're having to

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.519 
start riding what they're having to
carry<00:00:20.520> tire<00:00:20.970> levers<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.480> means<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:22.439> know

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
carry tire levers it means you know

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.230 
carry tire levers it means you know
you're<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.710> lot<00:00:22.830> more<00:00:22.890> confident<00:00:23.580> in<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:23.730> tire

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
you're a lot more confident in that tire

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.080 
you're a lot more confident in that tire
change<00:00:24.949> and<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.099> have<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.340> carry<00:00:26.519> tire<00:00:26.760> levers

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
change and you have to carry tire levers

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.839 
change and you have to carry tire levers
so<00:00:27.240> it's<00:00:27.359> less<00:00:27.570> weight<00:00:27.810> less<00:00:28.080> stuff<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.380> forget

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
so it's less weight less stuff to forget

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.400 
so it's less weight less stuff to forget
so<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.970> main<00:00:30.119> thing<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.390> once<00:00:30.869> up<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.140> get<00:00:31.320> it

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
so the main thing is once up you get it

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.590 
so the main thing is once up you get it
deflated<00:00:31.769> or<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.040> have<00:00:32.160> your<00:00:32.309> fly<00:00:32.550> what<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.480> do

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
deflated or you have your fly what I do

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.240 
deflated or you have your fly what I do
is<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.840> sort<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.110> start<00:00:34.380> here<00:00:34.559> at<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.710> top<00:00:34.980> and

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
is I sort of start here at the top and

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.130 
is I sort of start here at the top and
basically<00:00:35.820> what<00:00:35.969> we<00:00:36.090> want<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.329> do<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.750> because

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
basically what we want to do is because

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.979 
basically what we want to do is because
the<00:00:37.649> rim<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.010> sort<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.670> scoop<00:00:39.480> we<00:00:39.690> want<00:00:39.899> to

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
the rim is sort of a scoop we want to

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.369 
the rim is sort of a scoop we want to
try<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.260> push<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.890> tire<00:00:41.670> into<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.840> then

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
try and push the tire into that and then

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.690 
try and push the tire into that and then
work<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.739> all<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:43.980> way<00:00:44.129> around<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.579> we

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
work it all the way around so that we

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.000 
work it all the way around so that we
have<00:00:44.730> lots<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.180> slack<00:00:45.420> on<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.719> ball<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.860> what<00:00:46.980> I

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
have lots of slack on the ball so what I

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.139 
have lots of slack on the ball so what I
do<00:00:47.129> they<00:00:47.460> sort<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:48.410> work<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.620> into<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.520> fridge

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
do they sort of work it into that fridge

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.490 
do they sort of work it into that fridge
and<00:00:51.420> make<00:00:51.539> sure<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.809> beads<00:00:52.020> are<00:00:52.170> all<00:00:52.320> and

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
and make sure the beads are all and

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.139 
and make sure the beads are all and
seated<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.039> then<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.550> should<00:00:53.760> have<00:00:53.789> locks

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
seated and then you should have locks

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.810 
seated and then you should have locks
black<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.050> then<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.920> can<00:00:56.070> see<00:00:56.219> I'm<00:00:56.340> insert<00:00:56.670> of

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
black and then you can see I'm insert of

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.939 
black and then you can see I'm insert of
a<00:00:56.940> little<00:00:57.480> squat<00:00:57.899> position<00:00:58.260> i'm<00:00:58.649> sort<00:00:58.890> of

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
a little squat position i'm sort of

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.279 
a little squat position i'm sort of
pressuring<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.760> here<00:01:00.329> with<00:01:00.449> my<00:01:00.600> thighs<00:01:00.870> and

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
pressuring it here with my thighs and

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.579 
pressuring it here with my thighs and
then<00:01:01.469> using<00:01:02.190> my<00:01:02.340> thumb's<00:01:02.989> to<00:01:03.989> work<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.379> tire

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
then using my thumb's to work the tire

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.800 
then using my thumb's to work the tire
and<00:01:04.949> keeping<00:01:05.339> using<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.090> hand<00:01:06.360> keep<00:01:06.630> it

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
and keeping using this hand keep it

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.200 
and keeping using this hand keep it
intact<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.189> we'll<00:01:08.790> get<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.000> tire<00:01:09.210> off<00:01:09.450> here<00:01:11.210> so

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
intact so we'll get the tire off here so

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.870 
intact so we'll get the tire off here so
we<00:01:12.299> have<00:01:12.420> our<00:01:12.450> tires<00:01:12.930> completely<00:01:13.500> off<00:01:13.670> this<00:01:14.670> it

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
our tire and we would normally inspect

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.140 
our tire and we would normally inspect
it<00:01:27.869> or<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.500> know<00:01:28.619> put<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:28.979> get<00:01:29.700> ready<00:01:29.850> for<00:01:29.939> some
