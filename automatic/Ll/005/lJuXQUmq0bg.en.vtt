board this is Rome's best board that

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.040 
board this is Rome's best board that
they<00:00:16.309> produce<00:00:16.460> and<00:00:16.940> it's<00:00:17.420> a<00:00:17.510> fantastic

they produce and it's a fantastic
all-mountain<00:00:18.260> freestyle<00:00:18.920> board<00:00:19.100> this<00:00:19.640> is<00:00:19.820> a

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
all-mountain freestyle board this is a

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.090 
all-mountain freestyle board this is a
slightly<00:00:20.300> more<00:00:20.720> medium<00:00:21.260> responsive<00:00:21.830> board

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
slightly more medium responsive board

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.019 
slightly more medium responsive board
this<00:00:22.250> is<00:00:22.340> not<00:00:22.490> going<00:00:22.580> to<00:00:22.640> be<00:00:22.730> good<00:00:22.880> for

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
this is not going to be good for

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.029 
this is not going to be good for
beginners<00:00:23.119> or<00:00:23.900> people<00:00:23.960> looking<00:00:24.529> to<00:00:24.650> spend<00:00:24.830> all

really<00:00:32.659> really<00:00:32.809> really<00:00:32.960> awesome<00:00:33.350> board<00:00:33.769> I've

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
really really really awesome board I've

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.309 
really really really awesome board I've
really<00:00:34.129> enjoyed<00:00:34.159> riding<00:00:34.609> it<00:00:34.819> today<00:00:35.030> actually

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:35.319 
really enjoyed riding it today actually

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:38.349 
really enjoyed riding it today actually
this<00:00:36.319> is<00:00:36.469> a<00:00:36.679> board<00:00:37.370> that<00:00:37.460> Rome<00:00:37.729> use<00:00:37.940> the<00:00:38.120> free

00:00:38.349 --> 00:00:38.359 
this is a board that Rome use the free

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:40.059 
this is a board that Rome use the free
pop<00:00:38.600> rocker<00:00:38.839> in<00:00:39.079> so<00:00:39.530> it's<00:00:39.649> flat<00:00:39.829> between<00:00:39.949> the

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:40.069 
pop rocker in so it's flat between the

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:42.160 
pop rocker in so it's flat between the
bindings<00:00:40.129> and<00:00:40.909> it's<00:00:41.089> got<00:00:41.239> rocker<00:00:41.539> out<00:00:41.899> in<00:00:42.079> the

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
bindings and it's got rocker out in the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.869 
bindings and it's got rocker out in the
nose<00:00:42.350> and<00:00:42.530> tail<00:00:42.679> and<00:00:43.339> they've<00:00:43.460> also<00:00:43.609> used

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
nose and tail and they've also used

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:45.459 
nose and tail and they've also used
their<00:00:43.999> fastest<00:00:44.420> pace<00:00:44.629> which<00:00:44.839> is<00:00:44.989> the<00:00:45.109> center

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
their fastest pace which is the center

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:47.950 
their fastest pace which is the center
carbon<00:00:45.889> base<00:00:46.100> really<00:00:47.030> fast<00:00:47.299> it's<00:00:47.809> got<00:00:47.929> a

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
carbon base really fast it's got a

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.719 
carbon base really fast it's got a
carbon<00:00:48.409> additive<00:00:48.829> which<00:00:49.129> I<00:00:49.309> allows<00:00:49.489> it<00:00:49.699> to

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:49.729 
carbon additive which I allows it to

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:51.309 
carbon additive which I allows it to
basically<00:00:50.149> reduce<00:00:50.510> the<00:00:50.659> friction<00:00:50.809> and<00:00:51.199> go

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:51.319 
basically reduce the friction and go

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:53.829 
basically reduce the friction and go
even<00:00:51.530> quicker<00:00:51.679> they've<00:00:52.670> used<00:00:52.850> Kevlar<00:00:53.389> impact

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:53.839 
even quicker they've used Kevlar impact

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:55.869 
even quicker they've used Kevlar impact
plates<00:00:54.079> in<00:00:54.229> this<00:00:54.379> one<00:00:54.589> this<00:00:55.129> actually<00:00:55.760> helps

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
plates in this one this actually helps

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.149 
plates in this one this actually helps
to<00:00:56.120> prevent<00:00:56.329> core<00:00:56.719> and<00:00:56.870> edge<00:00:56.959> damage<00:00:57.409> and<00:00:57.649> also

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.159 
to prevent core and edge damage and also

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:00.160 
to prevent core and edge damage and also
softens<00:00:58.609> heavy<00:00:58.789> landings<00:00:59.209> and<00:00:59.420> then<00:01:00.049> you've

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
softens heavy landings and then you've

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.139 
softens heavy landings and then you've
also<00:01:00.260> got<00:01:00.589> the<00:01:00.679> super<00:01:01.039> light<00:01:01.219> light<00:01:01.549> by<00:01:01.940> ax

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
also got the super light light by ax

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.299 
also got the super light light by ax
laminates<00:01:02.869> built<00:01:03.649> into<00:01:03.920> the<00:01:04.010> actual

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
laminates built into the actual

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:05.950 
laminates built into the actual
construction<00:01:04.489> of<00:01:04.879> the<00:01:04.970> board<00:01:05.180> and<00:01:05.360> this<00:01:05.780> keeps

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
construction of the board and this keeps

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.690 
construction of the board and this keeps
it<00:01:06.140> extremely<00:01:06.830> light<00:01:07.190> this<00:01:07.340> is<00:01:07.460> one<00:01:07.550> of<00:01:07.580> the

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
it extremely light this is one of the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.520 
it extremely light this is one of the
lights<00:01:07.910> boards<00:01:08.300> I've<00:01:08.390> ridden<00:01:08.570> today<00:01:08.750> and<00:01:09.110> it's

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
lights boards I've ridden today and it's

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.380 
lights boards I've ridden today and it's
also<00:01:09.680> really<00:01:09.950> smooth<00:01:10.370> and<00:01:10.610> fun<00:01:10.790> torsionally

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
also really smooth and fun torsionally

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.510 
also really smooth and fun torsionally
in<00:01:11.480> terms<00:01:11.780> of<00:01:11.900> flex<00:01:12.170> knots<00:01:12.800> has<00:01:12.950> lots<00:01:13.190> of<00:01:13.280> power

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
in terms of flex knots has lots of power

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.220 
in terms of flex knots has lots of power
if<00:01:13.760> you<00:01:13.910> know<00:01:14.090> really<00:01:14.420> hammer<00:01:14.630> it<00:01:14.750> into<00:01:14.840> a<00:01:14.930> car

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.230 
if you know really hammer it into a car

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.800 
if you know really hammer it into a car
it's<00:01:16.070> got<00:01:16.220> the<00:01:16.340> carbon<00:01:16.970> double<00:01:17.300> barrel<00:01:17.630> hot

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
it's got the carbon double barrel hot

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.450 
it's got the carbon double barrel hot
rods<00:01:18.050> these<00:01:18.500> are<00:01:18.620> two<00:01:18.770> rods<00:01:19.040> that<00:01:19.190> run<00:01:19.370> along

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
rods these are two rods that run along

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.130 
rods these are two rods that run along
the<00:01:19.670> board<00:01:19.910> these<00:01:20.450> really<00:01:20.780> help<00:01:20.930> to<00:01:20.960> increase

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
the board these really help to increase

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.990 
the board these really help to increase
the<00:01:21.530> ollie<00:01:21.710> and<00:01:21.950> pop<00:01:22.160> in<00:01:22.400> the<00:01:22.490> nose<00:01:22.670> and<00:01:22.820> tail

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
the ollie and pop in the nose and tail

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.020 
the ollie and pop in the nose and tail
and<00:01:23.540> really<00:01:23.720> add<00:01:23.810> more<00:01:23.990> power<00:01:24.230> in<00:01:24.350> those<00:01:24.500> turns

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
and really add more power in those turns

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.130 
and really add more power in those turns
not<00:01:26.030> one<00:01:26.180> for<00:01:26.330> beginners<00:01:26.690> like<00:01:26.840> I<00:01:26.960> said

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
not one for beginners like I said

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.600 
not one for beginners like I said
earlier<00:01:27.170> this<00:01:27.470> is<00:01:27.650> really<00:01:27.860> an<00:01:28.040> intermediate

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
earlier this is really an intermediate

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.370 
earlier this is really an intermediate
to<00:01:28.640> advanced<00:01:28.970> riders<00:01:29.330> board<00:01:29.570> but<00:01:30.200> this<00:01:30.230> is

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
to advanced riders board but this is

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.540 
to advanced riders board but this is
definitely<00:01:30.590> one<00:01:30.830> of<00:01:30.890> my<00:01:30.980> sort<00:01:31.220> of<00:01:31.280> favorite

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
definitely one of my sort of favorite

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.920 
definitely one of my sort of favorite
boards<00:01:31.760> of<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:31.910> day<00:01:32.060> and<00:01:32.300> I<00:01:32.420> would<00:01:32.480> massively

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
boards of the day and I would massively

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.870 
boards of the day and I would massively
recommend<00:01:33.440> it<00:01:33.530> to<00:01:33.560> anyone<00:01:33.800> who<00:01:34.370> really<00:01:34.580> enjoy

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
recommend it to anyone who really enjoy

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.190 
recommend it to anyone who really enjoy
sort<00:01:35.180> of<00:01:35.240> tearing<00:01:35.450> up<00:01:35.540> the<00:01:35.600> mountain<00:01:35.990> at<00:01:36.140> a
