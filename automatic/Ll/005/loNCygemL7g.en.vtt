to help you know move his inspirations
beyond<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.689> further<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.560> everything<00:01:23.310> just

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
beyond and further so everything just

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.640 
beyond and further so everything just
basically<00:01:24.659> comes<00:01:25.020> from<00:01:25.140> his<00:01:25.229> world<00:01:25.439> and

basically comes from his world and

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.710 
basically comes from his world and
that's<00:01:25.740> how<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:26.369> approach<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.570> design

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
that's how I approach the design

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.840 
that's how I approach the design
basically<00:01:28.650> wherever<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.040> see<00:01:29.250> sparkle<00:01:29.759> and

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
basically wherever you see sparkle and

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.789 
basically wherever you see sparkle and
shine<00:01:30.119> you're<00:01:30.570> gonna<00:01:30.689> know<00:01:30.960> immediately<00:01:31.320> that

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
shine you're gonna know immediately that

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.399 
shine you're gonna know immediately that
