00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.659
 hi just a little video in the 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:17.070
 nature to show you what I 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:18.270
 Norman and then I think I 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.000
 know I got to a configuration 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.800
 which I like well because nothing of that 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.420
 I left would not have been more 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.859
 useful and at the same time I use to little 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.240
 near all cases in the bag so I'm going 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.670
 to show you quickly what I'm taking 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.630
 then already the bag as I have said in 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.739
 a previous video 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.989
 I pass by the first dorsal strap 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.399
 of my backpack what makes it so 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.809
 always ahead but we will do everything 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.180
 slung but suspended 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.250
 like that and if I'm good balance 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.629
 not too much so I always have access 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.910
 at the bags open it I can take my 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.110
 camera take pictures sorry 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.629
 for noise found itself on the mic 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.850
 and it makes me a little support if I 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.320
 will be more stable like that I can 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.579
 I can put my elbows and it makes me 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.590
 it allows me to be more stable on our 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.809
 photos and videos so it's not bad 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.309
 so we will quickly look at what 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.260
 is in then hop I take the camera 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.700
 then we will open their already here on 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.990
 the cover there is the small tripods 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.189
 gorillapod that he has and under the eye to 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.580
 Pros on the other side I put nothing in 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.180
 the pocket 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.170
 here behind I'm going to get away classify 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.820
 the little paper cards I have 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.900
 printed 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.310
 I put them in the order that I use 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.350
 so that's the next one it will be 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.580
 this one and that's so it's very 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.920
 practical because suddenly I always 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.159
 focused I do not even need to stop 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:38.400
 in the little pocket y siro I have a 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:42.360
 polarizing filter for the 50 min 56 mm 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.939
 these two polarizing filters for the 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.470
 for small goals 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:49.500
 alas here I have myself pack 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.500
 of increase 52 55 min 52 58 mm which 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:56.969
 lets put this filter there on the 50 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.850
 mm who got him a son task of 52 and 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.820
 when we open inside so here 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.570
 the my device in the central pocket 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.390
 that's when I go out I put 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.060
 systematically the little thongs the 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.430
 little straps from peak design that 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.980
 very very well and you see that I 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.530
 leaves always ride my above 55,250 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.900
 the zoom and I'm doing that simply 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.310
 because it allows me to take 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.660
 quickly in photo something that 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.300
 is very far away I noticed that 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.560
 general when I need this 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.900
 goal was quickly ie 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.209
 that bahia a bird or an animal that I 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.700
 see who is very far or else there as 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.530
 I am a hike near a river 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.450
 there are from time to time canoes kayaks there 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.220
 goes on and so not when the keirin 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.050
 Canoeing goes half an hour 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.090
 hour so all power draw and 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.840
 take the picture right away so 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.950
 that's why I let it go 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.410
 on it and it's not necessarily the one 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.080
 that I use the most here so basically 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.470
 the central pocket we have the sun visor 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.170
 kills 55,250 and we also have the sun visor 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.849
 the ultra wide angle demand of tokina 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.739
 that's still available 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:04.069
 here on the right I have my rate 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:07.260
 who did not then he is well stalled follows the 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:10.800
 lane there and I always go up 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.849
 on top of my polarizing filter 70 mm because 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.190
 that as I almost make 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.650
 pictures of landscapes with those with this 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.790
 goal there I have almost all the 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.659
 time need to put my polarizer 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:18.900
 so I always let go 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:20.430
 above 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.590
 finally I do not need a bta the 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.959
 take it off they put back every time it 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.620
 if I put my little cache 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.849
 hop there that my little cache of goals 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.310
 that I use to make transfers 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:36.540
 from one lens to another 50 mm 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:39.060
 here and then 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.490
 here we have two boxes of filters so the 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.800
 box of polarizing filters that 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.970
 I do not use too much for 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.640
 a few times when I have to withdraw my 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.930
 polarizing filter and my filter end 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.700
 emile that allows to do long 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.950
 breaks for having parade clouds of 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.330
 trickles of water what kind of things and if 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.540
 spare batteries of which I have two 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.190
 spare batteries for me for my 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.540
 reflex and spare batteries for 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:07.920
 my go pro here in the little pocket 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:10.500
 zipped in there I have a little trouble lens that 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.170
 allows me to clean the clean 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.000
 the goal quickly if ever there is 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:19.080
 small tasks 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.540
 I have in case a little tab for 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.710
 clean my sensors if ever really 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.270
 I realize that it's too much fun 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.200
 and then a little rag that serves 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:31.080
 always here is to put the 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.090
 SD cards but the agent is not 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.330
 not in because I have one in my 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:39.030
 go pro and one in my SLR and finally 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.590
 last pocket there in front then there he 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.080
 nothing but it's simply 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.529
 because in I put my go pro here 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.779
 and here I put my 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:49.159
 the sound recorder that I have not bad 

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:52.129
 used to try to record the 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:54.319
 sounds of birds the sounds of games you 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:58.009
 just show up 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:59.509
 my little zoom ha hate and I 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:02.149
 used for the dojo surveyed uses 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:07.039
 there with my lapel microphone that's just 

00:05:02.149 --> 00:05:08.719
 there to record this video so is 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:10.069
 that's all it comes in the bag and that 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:12.489
 come back pretty well welcome when 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:15.379
 even and then I like it 

00:05:12.489 --> 00:05:16.669
 this was a little video on the 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:16.999
 field and then I tell you to very 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:19.539
 soon 

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:19.539
 ciao
