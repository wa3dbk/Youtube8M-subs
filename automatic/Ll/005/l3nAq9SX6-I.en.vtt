was<00:00:24.480> like<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.839> think<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.320> was<00:00:25.410> pretty<00:00:25.589> much<00:00:25.740> the

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
was like I think it was pretty much the

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.509 
was like I think it was pretty much the
only<00:00:25.980> cool<00:00:26.400> color<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:27.119> they<00:00:27.269> offered<00:00:28.279> but<00:00:29.279> I

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
only cool color that they offered but I

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.849 
only cool color that they offered but I
was<00:00:29.669> hoping<00:00:29.999> that<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.329> would<00:00:30.419> be<00:00:30.859> slightly

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
was hoping that it would be slightly

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.350 
was hoping that it would be slightly
more<00:00:32.130> pigmented<00:00:32.640> than<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.120> want<00:00:33.300> to

imagine<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:08.550> know<00:01:08.670> if<00:01:09.600> you're<00:01:09.780> already

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:09.870 
imagine you know if you're already

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.990 
imagine you know if you're already
darker<00:01:10.290> than<00:01:10.440> me<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:10.950> don't<00:01:11.190> know<00:01:11.280> if<00:01:11.670> this<00:01:11.880> was

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
darker than me I don't know if this was

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.190 
darker than me I don't know if this was
even<00:01:12.090> work<00:01:12.300> as<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.450> blush<00:01:12.660> it<00:01:12.810> would<00:01:12.900> definitely

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
even work as a blush it would definitely

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.950 
even work as a blush it would definitely
work<00:01:13.260> as<00:01:13.410> a<00:01:13.440> highlighter<00:01:14.450> but<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.720> kind<00:01:15.900> of

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
work as a highlighter but that kind of

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.240 
work as a highlighter but that kind of
defeats<00:01:16.260> the<00:01:16.350> purpose<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.770> having<00:01:16.830> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
defeats the purpose of having the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.340 
defeats the purpose of having the
ambient<00:01:18.150> glow<00:01:18.210> highlighting<00:01:18.750> blush<00:01:18.960> as<00:01:19.200> if

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
ambient glow highlighting blush as if

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:28.250 
ambient glow highlighting blush as if

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
cereal glow on the back and it has a

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.110 
cereal glow on the back and it has a
mirror<00:02:13.930> inside<00:02:14.350> when<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:14.770> open<00:02:15.070> it<00:02:15.160> up<00:02:15.280> so<00:02:16.090> I

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
mirror inside when you open it up so I

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.970 
mirror inside when you open it up so I
mean<00:02:16.270> it's<00:02:16.660> a<00:02:16.810> beautiful<00:02:17.170> product<00:02:17.410> it's<00:02:17.860> just

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
mean it's a beautiful product it's just

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.800 
mean it's a beautiful product it's just
I<00:02:18.370> feel<00:02:18.700> like<00:02:18.850> it's<00:02:19.000> not<00:02:19.120> pigmented<00:02:19.600> enough

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
I feel like it's not pigmented enough

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.010 
I feel like it's not pigmented enough
for<00:02:19.959> the<00:02:20.020> price<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.590> so<00:02:21.030> anyway<00:02:22.030> it's<00:02:22.510> been<00:02:22.780> a

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
for the price and so anyway it's been a

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.740 
for the price and so anyway it's been a
disappointment<00:02:23.560> to<00:02:23.709> me<00:02:24.330> it's<00:02:25.330> supposed<00:02:25.660> to

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
disappointment to me it's supposed to

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.810 
disappointment to me it's supposed to
provide<00:02:26.020> multi-dimensional<00:02:27.010> color<00:02:27.250> so<00:02:27.670> it's

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
provide multi-dimensional color so it's

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.760 
provide multi-dimensional color so it's
not<00:02:27.970> flat<00:02:28.330> so<00:02:28.780> it's<00:02:29.020> very<00:02:29.140> flattering<00:02:29.440> to<00:02:29.620> the

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
not flat so it's very flattering to the

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.949 
not flat so it's very flattering to the
face<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.310> I<00:02:30.610> guess<00:02:31.090> I<00:02:31.209> do<00:02:31.270> feel<00:02:31.510> like<00:02:31.630> it<00:02:31.780> does

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
face and I guess I do feel like it does

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.190 
face and I guess I do feel like it does
that<00:02:32.200> it's<00:02:32.410> just<00:02:32.650> it's<00:02:33.370> so<00:02:33.580> faint<00:02:33.880> it's<00:02:34.390> if<00:02:35.020> it

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
that it's just it's so faint it's if it

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.510 
that it's just it's so faint it's if it
had<00:02:35.320> a<00:02:35.350> little<00:02:35.530> bit<00:02:35.680> more<00:02:35.739> pigmentation<00:02:36.250> I

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
had a little bit more pigmentation I

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.970 
had a little bit more pigmentation I
would<00:02:36.670> love<00:02:36.850> it<00:02:37.290> unfortunately<00:02:38.290> I<00:02:38.380> don't<00:02:38.709> love

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
would love it unfortunately I don't love

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.830 
would love it unfortunately I don't love
it<00:02:39.160> but<00:02:39.239> anyway<00:02:40.239> I<00:02:40.270> wanted<00:02:40.450> to<00:02:40.540> share<00:02:40.690> it<00:02:40.750> with
