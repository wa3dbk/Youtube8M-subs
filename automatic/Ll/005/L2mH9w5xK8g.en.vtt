whatever you're wearing and your pinky

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.490 
whatever you're wearing and your pinky
or<00:01:34.979> your<00:01:35.100> MIDI<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.460> adding<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.140> one<00:01:37.140> finger

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
or your MIDI and adding it to one finger

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.830 
or your MIDI and adding it to one finger
it's<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.920> really<00:01:38.250> great<00:01:38.400> strong<00:01:38.820> look<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.329> used

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
it's a really great strong look I used

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.990 
it's a really great strong look I used
to<00:01:40.049> think<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.380> there<00:01:41.159> was<00:01:41.280> never<00:01:41.520> too<00:01:41.850> much

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
to think that there was never too much

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.030 
to think that there was never too much
but<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.600> think<00:01:42.960> if<00:01:43.049> you're<00:01:43.140> careful<00:01:43.439> about<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.920> I

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
but I think if you're careful about it I

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.770 
but I think if you're careful about it I
think<00:01:44.100> doing<00:01:44.729> one<00:01:44.939> finger<00:01:45.360> instead<00:01:45.630> of

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
think doing one finger instead of

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.880 
think doing one finger instead of
putting<00:01:45.960> your<00:01:46.110> rings<00:01:46.350> on<00:01:46.470> every<00:01:46.619> single

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
putting your rings on every single

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.080 
putting your rings on every single
finger<00:01:47.250> because<00:01:47.549> you're<00:01:47.670> sort<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:47.970> getting

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
finger because you're sort of getting

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.340 
finger because you're sort of getting
more<00:01:48.450> bang<00:01:48.630> for<00:01:48.659> your<00:01:48.840> buck<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.200> you're

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
more bang for your buck and you're

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.810 
more bang for your buck and you're
getting<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.890> look<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.369> want<00:01:50.399> but<00:01:50.759> I

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
getting the look that you want but I

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.889 
getting the look that you want but I
feel<00:01:51.030> like<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.299> just<00:01:51.450> looks<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.630> little<00:01:51.659> bit

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
feel like it just looks a little bit

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.330 
feel like it just looks a little bit
Messier<00:01:52.229> when<00:01:52.439> it's<00:01:52.619> spread<00:01:52.890> out<00:01:52.920> over<00:01:53.040> your
