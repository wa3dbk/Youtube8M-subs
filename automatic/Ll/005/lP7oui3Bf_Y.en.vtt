let me tell you let me explain your
building<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.989> these<00:00:33.989> colors<00:00:34.200> when<00:00:34.649> comes

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
building and these colors when comes

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.160 
building and these colors when comes
into<00:00:35.280> contact<00:00:35.460> with<00:00:35.700> your<00:00:35.820> skin<00:00:36.570> they<00:00:36.989> can

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
into contact with your skin they can

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.760 
into contact with your skin they can

cause dermatitis or a skin allergy and

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:50.930 
cause dermatitis or a skin allergy and
it<00:00:40.770> can<00:00:40.920> cause<00:00:41.129> color<00:00:41.940> poisoning<00:00:49.160> so<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.700> use

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
it can cause color poisoning so the use

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.229 
it can cause color poisoning so the use
of<00:00:51.180> colors<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:52.219> holy<00:00:53.219> has<00:00:54.030> many<00:00:54.449> health<00:00:54.809> risk<00:00:55.410> -

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
of colors in holy has many health risk -

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.970 
of colors in holy has many health risk -
for<00:00:57.239> example<00:00:57.329> red<00:00:58.289> color<00:01:00.050> it<00:01:01.050> contain<00:01:01.500> mercury

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
for example red color it contain mercury

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.359 
for example red color it contain mercury
and<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:03.059> can<00:01:03.239> cause<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.960> skin<00:01:04.110> cancer<00:01:04.650> mercury

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
and it can cause the skin cancer mercury

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.420 
and it can cause the skin cancer mercury
can<00:01:05.970> pass<00:01:06.240> through<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.170> placenta<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.890> can

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
can pass through the placenta and can

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.530 
can pass through the placenta and can
affect<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.570> baby<00:01:09.780> blue<00:01:10.740> color<00:01:12.979> contain

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
affect the baby blue color contain

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.310 
affect the baby blue color contain
Prussian<00:01:15.540> blue<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:16.130> kind<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.250> dye<00:01:17.630> so<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:19.110> can

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
Prussian blue a kind of dye so this can

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.690 
Prussian blue a kind of dye so this can
cause<00:01:19.530> dermatitis<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.270> skin<00:01:22.460> black<00:01:23.460> color

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
cause dermatitis of the skin black color

cause dermatitis of the skin black color
contain<00:01:24.540> lead<00:01:25.049> particles<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.830> let<00:01:26.400> as<00:01:26.580> you

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
contain lead particles and let as you

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.460 
contain lead particles and let as you
know<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.420> can<00:01:27.570> cause<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.900> lead<00:01:28.049> poison

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
know that it can cause the lead poison

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.249 
know that it can cause the lead poison
and<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.490> really<00:01:29.820> very<00:01:30.119> dangerous<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:31.079> can

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
and that is really very dangerous it can

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.039 
and that is really very dangerous it can
cause<00:01:31.439> renal<00:01:31.920> failure<00:01:32.189> -<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:33.630> can<00:01:33.810> also

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
cause renal failure - and it can also

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.429 
cause renal failure - and it can also
pass<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.680> placenta<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.689> can<00:01:36.689> cause

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
pass the placenta and can cause

if inhaled can precipitate the asthma

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.570 
if inhaled can precipitate the asthma
attack<00:01:59.770> and<00:02:00.770> when<00:02:01.720> it<00:02:02.720> is<00:02:03.170> they<00:02:04.009> come<00:02:04.189> in<00:02:04.340> when

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
attack and when it is they come in when

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.980 
attack and when it is they come in when
it<00:02:04.729> comes<00:02:04.939> into<00:02:05.149> contact<00:02:05.299> with<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:05.600> eyes<00:02:05.750> it

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
it comes into contact with the eyes it

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.050 
it comes into contact with the eyes it
can<00:02:06.110> cause<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:06.799> temporary<00:02:07.280> blindness<00:02:07.820> as

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
can cause the temporary blindness as

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.850 
can cause the temporary blindness as
well<00:02:08.119> as<00:02:08.479> a<00:02:08.630> rotation<00:02:09.110> or<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.289> watering<00:02:09.769> of
