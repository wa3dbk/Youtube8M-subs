this is for Rick and he asked me the
question<00:00:22.680> how<00:00:23.369> do<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.580> connect<00:00:23.970> scales<00:00:24.300> low<00:00:24.779> to

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
question how do I connect scales low to

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.019 
question how do I connect scales low to
high<00:00:26.000> well<00:00:27.000> that's<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.990> heck<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.380> study<00:00:29.029> I'm

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
high well that's a heck of a study I'm

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.460 
high well that's a heck of a study I'm
not<00:00:30.240> going<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.449> be<00:00:30.539> able<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.779> cover<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.080> all<00:00:31.230> in

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
not going to be able to cover it all in

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.620 
not going to be able to cover it all in
one<00:00:32.009> lesson<00:00:32.250> but<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:32.759> can<00:00:32.940> give<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.210> start

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
one lesson but I can give you a start

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.130 
one lesson but I can give you a start
how's<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:35.090> how<00:00:36.090> do<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.360> connect<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.870> scales

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
how's that how do you connect the scales

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.470 
how's that how do you connect the scales
low<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.469> high<00:00:37.760> when<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.820> have<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.059> pick<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.239> key

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
low to high when you have to pick a key

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.799 
low to high when you have to pick a key
first<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:40.170> guess<00:00:40.379> that's<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.829> first<00:00:40.860> thing

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
first I guess that's the first thing

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.090 
first I guess that's the first thing
let's<00:00:42.809> take<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.020> look<00:00:43.230> at<00:00:43.320> E<00:00:43.410> minor<00:00:43.680> for<00:00:44.070> a

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
let's take a look at E minor for a

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.340 
let's take a look at E minor for a
minute<00:00:44.399> now<00:00:45.059> some<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.480> basic<00:00:45.899> scales<00:00:46.170> I

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
minute now some of the basic scales I

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.139 
minute now some of the basic scales I
teach<00:00:47.690> this<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.870> an<00:00:49.020> E<00:00:49.170> minor<00:00:49.730> diatonic<00:00:50.730> seven

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
teach this is an E minor diatonic seven

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.500 
teach this is an E minor diatonic seven
notes<00:00:51.329> scale<00:00:52.640> the<00:00:53.640> thing<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:53.969> if<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.239> know<00:00:54.360> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
notes scale the thing is if you know the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.720 
notes scale the thing is if you know the
diatonic<00:00:55.079> scales<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.920> blue<00:00:56.129> scales<00:00:56.520> are

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
diatonic scales and the blue scales are

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.729 
diatonic scales and the blue scales are
pentatonic<00:00:59.660> they<00:01:00.660> follow<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.140> same<00:01:01.170> suit

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
pentatonic they follow the same suit

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.990 
pentatonic they follow the same suit
right<00:01:02.390> now<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:04.290> have<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.530> pentatonic<00:01:05.220> scale<00:01:05.850> up

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
right now you have a pentatonic scale up

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000 
right now you have a pentatonic scale up
here<00:01:06.210> or<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.450> diatonic<00:01:07.049> scale<00:01:07.350> up<00:01:07.530> here<00:01:07.740> to

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
here or the diatonic scale up here to

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.310 
here or the diatonic scale up here to
after<00:01:08.970> twelfth<00:01:09.299> fret<00:01:09.479> it's<00:01:10.020> like<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.290> E

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
after twelfth fret it's like that E

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.560 
after twelfth fret it's like that E
minor<00:01:10.650> here<00:01:10.950> open<00:01:11.310> same<00:01:11.580> pattern<00:01:12.060> now

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
minor here open same pattern now

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.450 
minor here open same pattern now
visually<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.080> doesn't<00:01:13.350> look<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.470> same<00:01:13.619> but<00:01:14.369> if

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
visually it doesn't look the same but if

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.420 
visually it doesn't look the same but if
you<00:01:14.490> didn't<00:01:14.820> have<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.090> nut<00:01:15.299> here<00:01:16.310> you<00:01:17.310> know

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
you didn't have the nut here you know

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.399 
you didn't have the nut here you know
you'd<00:01:18.060> be<00:01:18.180> playing<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.600> fret<00:01:18.869> you'd<00:01:19.110> be<00:01:19.200> playing

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
you'd be playing a fret you'd be playing

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.469 
you'd be playing a fret you'd be playing
behind<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.950> fret<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.790> pattern<00:01:21.119> then<00:01:21.330> it

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
behind the fret so the pattern then it

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.539 
behind the fret so the pattern then it
looks<00:01:21.659> visually<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.170> same<00:01:22.500> but<00:01:23.070> they<00:01:23.220> are<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
looks visually the same but they are the

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.600 
looks visually the same but they are the
same<00:01:23.790> notes<00:01:24.259> now<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.320> can<00:01:25.530> either<00:01:25.650> just<00:01:25.950> know

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
same notes now you can either just know

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.160 
same notes now you can either just know
the<00:01:26.790> notes<00:01:26.970> or<00:01:27.270> know<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.479> pattern<00:01:27.869> because

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
the notes or know the pattern because

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.380 
the notes or know the pattern because
there's<00:01:28.409> many<00:01:29.400> different<00:01:29.759> approaches<00:01:30.180> some

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
there's many different approaches some

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.480 
there's many different approaches some
people<00:01:30.689> more<00:01:30.810> pattern<00:01:31.229> players<00:01:31.530> unless<00:01:31.920> from

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
people more pattern players unless from

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.340 
people more pattern players unless from
the<00:01:32.579> note<00:01:32.759> eventually<00:01:33.600> though<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.810> do<00:01:34.079> want

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
the note eventually though you do want

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.410 
the note eventually though you do want
to<00:01:34.439> learn<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:35.250> know<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.490> notes<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:35.909> your<00:01:36.150> get

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
to learn you know the notes in your get

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.170 
to learn you know the notes in your get
on<00:01:36.600> your<00:01:36.780> guitar<00:01:37.070> but<00:01:38.070> if<00:01:38.250> you're<00:01:38.549> not<00:01:38.909> at<00:01:39.090> that

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
on your guitar but if you're not at that

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.620 
on your guitar but if you're not at that
stage<00:01:39.240> yet<00:01:39.570> that's<00:01:39.930> okay<00:01:40.290> too<00:01:40.350> but<00:01:41.630> patterns

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
stage yet that's okay too but patterns

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.050 
stage yet that's okay too but patterns
work<00:01:42.869> really<00:01:43.110> good<00:01:43.490> if<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.640> were<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.850> take<00:01:45.030> a

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
work really good if you were to take a

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.980 
work really good if you were to take a
look<00:01:45.329> at<00:01:45.450> this<00:01:45.659> E<00:01:47.240> minor<00:01:48.240> pattern<00:01:48.630> wherever

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
look at this E minor pattern wherever

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.960 
look at this E minor pattern wherever
you've<00:01:49.170> got<00:01:49.380> an<00:01:49.500> E<00:01:49.710> minor<00:01:49.920> or<00:01:50.340> wave<00:01:50.729> you've<00:01:50.850> got

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
you've got an E minor or wave you've got

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:58.209 
you've got an E minor or wave you've got
an<00:01:51.090> E

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:00.679 

you<00:01:59.219> have<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.520> so<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.850> can<00:02:00.000> start<00:02:00.240> joining

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
you have that so you can start joining

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.649 
you have that so you can start joining
the<00:02:00.750> scale<00:02:00.960> when<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.170> call<00:02:01.409> some<00:02:01.649> metrics<00:02:02.659> which

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
the scale when I call some metrics which

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:13.270 
the scale when I call some metrics which
is<00:02:03.840> pattern<00:02:05.450> oriented<00:02:07.789> go<00:02:08.789> find<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.179> next<00:02:09.300> D

you<00:02:14.280> know<00:02:14.420> depends<00:02:15.420> on<00:02:15.510> your<00:02:15.900> on<00:02:16.170> your<00:02:16.410> vision

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
you know depends on your on your vision

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.789 
you know depends on your on your vision
with<00:02:16.920> that<00:02:17.209> a<00:02:18.209> lot<00:02:18.660> of<00:02:18.750> times<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:19.140> teach<00:02:19.530> my

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
with that a lot of times I teach my

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.559 
with that a lot of times I teach my
students<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.310> couple<00:02:20.549> scale<00:02:20.940> patterns<00:02:21.360> and

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
students a couple scale patterns and

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:22.729 
students a couple scale patterns and
then<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:21.690> teach<00:02:21.810> them<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.200> move<00:02:22.319> the<00:02:22.470> scale

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
then I teach them to move the scale

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.759 
then I teach them to move the scale
patterns<00:02:23.160> around<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:24.209> repeat<00:02:24.780> them<00:02:25.019> one<00:02:25.739> of

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
patterns around and repeat them one of

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.460 
patterns around and repeat them one of
the<00:02:25.920> best<00:02:26.160> examples<00:02:26.849> is<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.480> climb<00:02:28.080> the

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
the best examples is the climb the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.390 
the best examples is the climb the
pentatonic<00:02:28.890> climb<00:02:30.470> now<00:02:31.470> this<00:02:31.709> doesn't<00:02:31.980> start

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
pentatonic climb now this doesn't start

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.280 
pentatonic climb now this doesn't start
on<00:02:32.549> the<00:02:32.670> tonic<00:02:35.690> really<00:02:36.690> what<00:02:36.870> you're<00:02:37.019> doing<00:02:37.049> is

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
on the tonic really what you're doing is

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.930 
on the tonic really what you're doing is
you're<00:02:37.470> repeating<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.069> same<00:02:38.310> notes<00:02:38.610> that<00:02:38.760> are

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
you're repeating the same notes that are

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.970 
you're repeating the same notes that are
in<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.180> scale<00:02:39.480> anywhere<00:02:40.049> you<00:02:40.260> can<00:02:40.410> find<00:02:40.440> them<00:02:40.860> on

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
in a scale anywhere you can find them on

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.970 
in a scale anywhere you can find them on
the<00:02:41.010> fret<00:02:41.310> board<00:02:41.340> right<00:02:42.049> so<00:02:43.049> for<00:02:43.200> example<00:02:43.680> here

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
the fret board right so for example here

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.559 
the fret board right so for example here
I<00:02:44.010> start<00:02:44.459> on<00:02:44.579> a<00:02:44.610> D<00:02:44.849> it's<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.180> e<00:02:45.209> pentatonic

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
I start on a D it's the e pentatonic

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.100 
I start on a D it's the e pentatonic
minor<00:02:46.019> scale<00:02:46.590> starting<00:02:47.310> on<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.780> 7/7<00:02:48.780> note<00:02:48.959> of

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
minor scale starting on the 7/7 note of

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:58.280 
minor scale starting on the 7/7 note of
the<00:02:49.200> scale<00:02:55.850> so<00:02:56.850> what<00:02:57.780> do<00:02:57.840> I<00:02:57.930> do<00:02:57.989> with<00:02:58.139> this

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
the scale so what do I do with this

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.550 
the scale so what do I do with this
thing

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
thing

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.590 
thing
well<00:02:58.859> if<00:02:58.980> there's<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.280> D<00:02:59.489> here<00:02:59.730> and<00:02:59.760> E<00:02:59.970> here<00:03:00.239> so

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
well if there's a D here and E here so

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.789 
well if there's a D here and E here so
there's<00:03:00.930> a<00:03:00.989> D<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.230> E<00:03:01.500> here<00:03:02.660> same<00:03:03.660> pattern<00:03:04.109> the

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
there's a D and E here same pattern the

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.030 
there's a D and E here same pattern the
notes<00:03:05.040> are<00:03:05.250> d<00:03:05.579> e<00:03:05.609> G<00:03:06.239> a<00:03:06.269> B<00:03:06.900> so<00:03:07.290> I<00:03:07.319> can<00:03:07.410> play<00:03:07.889> the

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
notes are d e G a B so I can play the

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:15.860 
notes are d e G a B so I can play the
same<00:03:08.220> thing<00:03:08.280> here<00:03:09.260> deg<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.500> B<00:03:11.069> you<00:03:11.880> know<00:03:14.660> so<00:03:15.660> same

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
same thing here deg a B you know so same

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.660 
same thing here deg a B you know so same
it'll<00:03:16.139> repeat<00:03:16.440> again<00:03:16.850> deg<00:03:17.850> ap<00:03:18.420> right<00:03:19.400> deg<00:03:20.430> ap

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
it'll repeat again deg ap right deg ap

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:29.460 
it'll repeat again deg ap right deg ap
deg<00:03:23.670> a<00:03:23.940> be

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.800 

now<00:03:30.400> you<00:03:30.459> notice<00:03:30.790> I<00:03:30.849> had<00:03:30.940> to<00:03:31.060> readjust<00:03:31.480> my

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
now you notice I had to readjust my

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.360 
now you notice I had to readjust my
pattern<00:03:32.290> a<00:03:32.319> little<00:03:32.530> because<00:03:32.800> I'm<00:03:32.890> crossing

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
pattern a little because I'm crossing

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.220 
pattern a little because I'm crossing
the<00:03:33.400> b-string<00:03:33.670> but<00:03:34.420> it's<00:03:34.569> really<00:03:34.780> the<00:03:35.020> same

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
the b-string but it's really the same

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:45.199 
the b-string but it's really the same
notes<00:03:36.780> deg<00:03:37.780> a<00:03:38.020> B<00:03:41.550> right<00:03:42.550> here<00:03:43.209> the<00:03:43.330> same<00:03:43.540> thing

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
notes deg a B right here the same thing

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:54.500 
notes deg a B right here the same thing
deg<00:03:46.209> maybe<00:03:48.630> keep<00:03:49.630> going<00:03:49.930> D<00:03:50.590> a<00:03:50.830> G<00:03:51.250> a<00:03:51.489> B<00:03:52.090> right<00:03:52.810> now

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
deg maybe keep going D a G a B right now

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.000 
deg maybe keep going D a G a B right now
if<00:03:55.510> you<00:03:55.690> took<00:03:55.840> these<00:03:55.989> two<00:03:56.230> scales<00:03:56.530> you<00:03:56.830> could

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
if you took these two scales you could

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.210 
if you took these two scales you could
literally<00:03:57.810> you<00:03:58.810> could<00:03:58.930> play<00:03:59.140> them<00:03:59.319> you<00:04:00.069> could

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
literally you could play them you could

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.979 
literally you could play them you could
join<00:04:00.370> these<00:04:00.550> two<00:04:00.760> scale<00:04:01.030> patterns<00:04:01.450> if<00:04:01.600> you

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
join these two scale patterns if you

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:03.270 
join these two scale patterns if you
were<00:04:02.080> more<00:04:02.260> into<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:02.560> scale<00:04:02.800> pattern<00:04:02.980> if<00:04:03.190> you

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
were more into the scale pattern if you

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.490 
were more into the scale pattern if you
knew<00:04:03.370> the<00:04:03.489> pattern<00:04:03.819> here<00:04:04.090> for<00:04:04.300> the<00:04:04.989> root<00:04:05.170> 5

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
knew the pattern here for the root 5

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.880 
knew the pattern here for the root 5
climb<00:04:06.489> was<00:04:06.790> like<00:04:06.970> this<00:04:07.209> and<00:04:07.930> for<00:04:08.380> the<00:04:08.470> root<00:04:08.590> 6

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
climb was like this and for the root 6

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.539 
climb was like this and for the root 6
like<00:04:09.310> this<00:04:10.260> what<00:04:11.260> you'll<00:04:11.440> notice<00:04:11.620> is<00:04:12.010> that

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
like this what you'll notice is that

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.970 
like this what you'll notice is that
they<00:04:12.819> overlap<00:04:13.090> right<00:04:13.750> for<00:04:14.350> example<00:04:14.769> you<00:04:14.830> could

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
they overlap right for example you could

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.900 
they overlap right for example you could
go<00:04:15.010> like<00:04:15.250> this<00:04:15.489> there's<00:04:16.180> the<00:04:16.479> e<00:04:16.510> G<00:04:17.200> a<00:04:17.410> B<00:04:17.950> well

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
go like this there's the e G a B well

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.310 
go like this there's the e G a B well
what's<00:04:19.090> next<00:04:19.269> d<00:04:19.840> e<00:04:20.200> G<00:04:21.040> a<00:04:21.280> B<00:04:21.850> you<00:04:22.419> know<00:04:22.540> and<00:04:23.169> what

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
what's next d e G a B you know and what

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.550 
what's next d e G a B you know and what
I<00:04:23.350> just<00:04:23.830> did<00:04:24.070> was<00:04:24.880> I<00:04:25.180> went<00:04:25.750> from<00:04:25.960> the<00:04:26.110> root<00:04:26.290> 5

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
I just did was I went from the root 5

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.060 
I just did was I went from the root 5
scale<00:04:27.479> to<00:04:28.479> the<00:04:28.600> root<00:04:28.750> 6<00:04:29.080> scale<00:04:29.380> so<00:04:29.620> depending

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
scale to the root 6 scale so depending

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.529 
scale to the root 6 scale so depending
on<00:04:30.220> how<00:04:31.530> you<00:04:32.530> relate<00:04:32.830> to<00:04:32.890> it<00:04:33.130> this<00:04:34.090> is<00:04:34.150> an<00:04:34.419> e

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
on how you relate to it this is an e

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.230 
on how you relate to it this is an e

relate it to the scale degrees but you

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.170 
relate it to the scale degrees but you
can<00:04:46.990> call<00:04:47.140> it<00:04:47.260> what<00:04:47.380> you<00:04:47.410> want<00:04:47.680> the<00:04:48.430> tonic<00:04:48.850> is<00:04:48.940> e

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
can call it what you want the tonic is e

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.969 
can call it what you want the tonic is e
we're<00:04:49.479> in<00:04:49.570> the<00:04:49.660> key<00:04:49.870> of<00:04:49.900> E<00:04:50.110> minor<00:04:50.650> pentatonic

we're in the key of E minor pentatonic

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:54.810 
we're in the key of E minor pentatonic
is<00:04:51.850> just<00:04:52.060> a<00:04:52.210> 5<00:04:52.450> note<00:04:52.780> scale<00:04:53.340> so<00:04:54.340> you<00:04:54.370> definitely

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
is just a 5 note scale so you definitely

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.460 
is just a 5 note scale so you definitely
have<00:04:55.120> to<00:04:55.330> understand<00:04:55.780> your<00:04:55.960> keys<00:04:56.200> and<00:04:56.380> you

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
have to understand your keys and you

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.320 
have to understand your keys and you
have<00:04:56.590> to<00:04:56.710> know<00:04:56.860> your<00:04:57.430> notes<00:04:57.640> or<00:04:57.760> your<00:04:57.820> patterns

have to know your notes or your patterns
a<00:04:58.450> little<00:04:58.479> bit<00:04:58.810> if<00:04:58.960> you<00:04:59.380> know<00:04:59.500> your<00:04:59.710> pattern

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
a little bit if you know your pattern

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.810 
a little bit if you know your pattern
like<00:05:01.150> this<00:05:01.180> is<00:05:01.450> a<00:05:01.479> root<00:05:01.780> 5<00:05:02.050> climb<00:05:05.340> your<00:05:06.340> 5<00:05:06.610> is<00:05:06.789> a

just took the last two notes and and

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:29.850

pentatonic and diatonic there but again

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.660 
pentatonic and diatonic there but again
it<00:05:34.940> will<00:05:35.000> go<00:05:35.150> over<00:05:35.180> this<00:05:35.390> one<00:05:35.600> more<00:05:35.630> time

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:36.670

maybe anywhere you can find a D there it

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.980 
maybe anywhere you can find a D there it
is<00:05:52.100> again<00:05:52.220> right

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
is again right

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.310 

so<00:06:06.740> I've<00:06:07.730> just<00:06:07.790> taken<00:06:08.210> the<00:06:08.450> two<00:06:08.630> patterns<00:06:08.870> and

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:09.320 
so I've just taken the two patterns and

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.590 
so I've just taken the two patterns and
joined<00:06:09.920> them<00:06:10.130> because<00:06:10.910> I<00:06:11.030> know<00:06:11.090> this<00:06:11.420> matter

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 
joined them because I know this matter

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:20.770 
joined them because I know this matter
overlaps<00:06:14.600> this<00:06:14.870> one<00:06:19.510> and<00:06:20.510> there<00:06:20.600> are<00:06:20.630> many

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
overlaps this one and there are many

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.750 
overlaps this one and there are many
ways<00:06:20.960> to<00:06:21.200> join<00:06:21.410> it<00:06:21.620> depends<00:06:22.430> on<00:06:22.520> where<00:06:22.640> you're

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:22.760 
ways to join it depends on where you're

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.370 
ways to join it depends on where you're
going<00:06:22.970> or<00:06:23.060> what<00:06:23.120> you're<00:06:23.210> doing<00:06:23.330> but<00:06:23.750> like<00:06:24.260> I

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
was showing you earlier I could go so

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:27.910 
was showing you earlier I could go so
here<00:06:26.330> I'm<00:06:26.450> at<00:06:26.630> the<00:06:26.660> fifth<00:06:26.930> fret<00:06:27.020> and<00:06:27.410> I'm<00:06:27.800> gonna

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:40.490 
go deg a B D G a B if you like it

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.750 
go deg a B D G a B if you like it
depends<00:06:40.910> on<00:06:41.000> what<00:06:41.120> you're<00:06:41.270> doing<00:06:41.300> right<00:06:42.760> deg

maybe<00:06:44.660> I'm<00:06:44.990> gonna<00:06:45.110> go<00:06:45.290> to<00:06:45.350> D<00:06:45.590> now<00:06:45.770> on<00:06:46.040> my<00:06:46.520> fourth

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:46.790 
maybe I'm gonna go to D now on my fourth

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:51.340 
maybe I'm gonna go to D now on my fourth
string<00:06:47.030> D<00:06:47.810> e<00:06:48.200> G<00:06:48.950> a<00:06:49.250> B<00:06:49.910> I'm<00:06:50.540> gonna<00:06:50.720> go<00:06:50.810> to<00:06:50.870> D<00:06:51.080> here

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:51.350 
string D e G a B I'm gonna go to D here

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:56.830 
string D e G a B I'm gonna go to D here
D<00:06:51.640> E<00:06:53.380> G<00:06:54.380> a<00:06:54.680> and<00:06:55.190> right<00:06:55.550> off<00:06:55.670> the<00:06:55.790> fretboard<00:06:56.030> so

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:56.840 
D E G a and right off the fretboard so

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.750 
D E G a and right off the fretboard so
you<00:06:56.900> could<00:06:57.140> literally<00:06:57.500> go<00:06:57.650> from<00:06:58.430> the<00:06:58.550> fifth

00:06:58.750 --> 00:06:58.760 
you could literally go from the fifth

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.160 
you could literally go from the fifth
fret<00:06:59.000> and<00:06:59.240> I<00:06:59.390> was<00:06:59.540> right<00:06:59.750> up<00:06:59.900> on<00:07:00.050> the

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:00.170 
fret and I was right up on the

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:04.510 
fret and I was right up on the
eighteenth<00:07:00.590> nineteenth<00:07:01.190> fret<00:07:01.460> there<00:07:03.520> that

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:04.520 
eighteenth nineteenth fret there that

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.180 
eighteenth nineteenth fret there that
covers<00:07:04.880> the<00:07:05.000> whole<00:07:05.030> fretboard<00:07:05.600> doesn't<00:07:06.080> it

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:06.190 
covers the whole fretboard doesn't it

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.340 
covers the whole fretboard doesn't it
yeah<00:07:07.190> and<00:07:07.460> the<00:07:07.640> idea<00:07:07.910> is<00:07:08.030> if<00:07:08.300> you<00:07:08.960> were<00:07:09.080> to<00:07:09.110> know

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:09.350 
yeah and the idea is if you were to know

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.830 
yeah and the idea is if you were to know
your<00:07:09.530> scales<00:07:09.950> like<00:07:10.460> the<00:07:10.970> three<00:07:11.240> main<00:07:11.450> scales

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 
your scales like the three main scales

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.780 
your scales like the three main scales
to<00:07:12.080> know<00:07:12.230> would<00:07:12.860> have<00:07:12.980> to<00:07:13.160> be<00:07:13.250> the<00:07:13.370> pentatonic

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:13.790 
to know would have to be the pentatonic

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:19.720 
to know would have to be the pentatonic
minor<00:07:14.710> the<00:07:16.720> diatonic<00:07:17.720> minor<00:07:18.110> and<00:07:18.770> a<00:07:18.950> relative

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:19.730 
minor the diatonic minor and a relative

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.060 
minor the diatonic minor and a relative
major<00:07:19.940> if<00:07:20.360> you<00:07:20.660> knew<00:07:20.810> those<00:07:21.020> three<00:07:21.290> scales<00:07:21.620> you

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:22.070 
major if you knew those three scales you

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.370 
major if you knew those three scales you
could<00:07:22.250> pretty<00:07:22.460> much<00:07:22.550> use<00:07:23.030> this<00:07:23.660> approach<00:07:24.050> and

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:24.380 
could pretty much use this approach and

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.170 
could pretty much use this approach and
cover<00:07:24.980> the<00:07:25.160> fretboard<00:07:25.400> because<00:07:25.790> you're

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:26.180 
cover the fretboard because you're

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.340 
cover the fretboard because you're
always<00:07:26.360> going<00:07:26.570> to<00:07:26.600> have<00:07:26.810> other<00:07:26.990> scale

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:27.350 
always going to have other scale

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.170 
always going to have other scale
positions<00:07:27.980> because<00:07:28.160> in<00:07:28.520> between<00:07:28.790> these

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:29.180 
positions because in between these

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.140 
positions because in between these
scales<00:07:29.570> we<00:07:29.900> have<00:07:30.050> other<00:07:30.200> patterns<00:07:31.190> wherever

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:32.150 
scales we have other patterns wherever

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.909 
scales we have other patterns wherever
we<00:07:32.360> can<00:07:32.540> find<00:07:32.780> the<00:07:32.930> notes<00:07:33.140> that<00:07:33.380> belong<00:07:33.650> in<00:07:33.680> the

00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:33.919 
we can find the notes that belong in the

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:36.310 
we can find the notes that belong in the
key<00:07:34.130> that's<00:07:34.880> where<00:07:35.390> we<00:07:35.479> have<00:07:35.630> another<00:07:35.900> scale

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:36.320 
key that's where we have another scale

the scales you already know or they're

the scales you already know or they're
