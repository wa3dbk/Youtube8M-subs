00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
really really impressive power range now

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.400 
really really impressive power range now
some<00:02:27.730> electric<00:02:28.090> cars<00:02:28.300> they<00:02:28.540> suffer<00:02:28.959> when<00:02:29.260> they

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
some electric cars they suffer when they

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.009 
some electric cars they suffer when they
sort<00:02:29.800> of<00:02:29.890> go<00:02:30.069> above<00:02:30.310> 50<00:02:30.489> miles<00:02:31.060> per<00:02:31.180> hour<00:02:31.390> they

sort of go above 50 miles per hour they

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
kind of run out of puff but this we were

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.949 
kind of run out of puff but this we were
on<00:02:35.319> the<00:02:35.440> motorway<00:02:36.010> earlier<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.700> we<00:02:37.630> were<00:02:37.720> over

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
on the motorway earlier and we were over

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.979 
on the motorway earlier and we were over
to<00:02:38.110> overtake<00:02:38.920> really<00:02:39.459> comfortably<00:02:39.940> and<00:02:40.239> still

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
to overtake really comfortably and still

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.750 
to overtake really comfortably and still
feel<00:02:41.260> like<00:02:41.410> there<00:02:41.590> was<00:02:41.680> more<00:02:41.860> power<00:02:42.160> left<00:02:42.580> in

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
feel like there was more power left in

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.150 
feel like there was more power left in
the<00:02:42.880> tank<00:02:43.150> to<00:02:43.420> go<00:02:44.019> even<00:02:44.290> faster

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.170 

so<00:02:48.820> on<00:02:49.000> all<00:02:49.240> the<00:02:49.720> eagle<00:02:50.680> is<00:02:50.920> a<00:02:51.160> hard<00:02:51.640> car<00:02:51.970> to

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
so on all the eagle is a hard car to

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.410 
so on all the eagle is a hard car to
test<00:02:52.890> for<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:53.950> most<00:02:54.190> part<00:02:54.490> it's<00:02:54.670> exactly<00:02:55.210> the

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
test for the most part it's exactly the

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.390 
test for the most part it's exactly the
same<00:02:55.600> as<00:02:55.660> any<00:02:55.930> golf<00:02:56.230> you<00:02:56.380> might<00:02:56.560> jump<00:02:56.770> into<00:02:57.130> and

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
same as any golf you might jump into and

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.520 
same as any golf you might jump into and
that<00:02:57.640> is<00:02:57.820> a<00:02:57.850> good<00:02:58.120> thing<00:02:58.420> it<00:02:58.960> handles<00:02:59.470> well

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
that is a good thing it handles well

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.370 
that is a good thing it handles well
it's<00:03:00.040> comfortable<00:03:00.550> and<00:03:00.820> it's<00:03:00.970> well<00:03:01.270> built<00:03:01.510> but

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
it's comfortable and it's well built but

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.990 
it's comfortable and it's well built but
if<00:03:02.740> you<00:03:03.160> want<00:03:03.340> something<00:03:03.670> that's<00:03:03.850> a<00:03:03.970> little

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
if you want something that's a little

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.990 
if you want something that's a little
more<00:03:04.300> futuristic<00:03:04.750> then<00:03:05.500> another<00:03:06.070> car<00:03:06.400> might

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
more futuristic then another car might

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.230 
more futuristic then another car might
be<00:03:07.180> for<00:03:07.390> you<00:03:08.280> that<00:03:09.280> said<00:03:09.610> there's<00:03:09.940> nothing

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
be for you that said there's nothing

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.780 
be for you that said there's nothing
old-fashioned<00:03:11.080> about<00:03:11.440> the<00:03:11.590> way<00:03:11.770> this<00:03:12.340> car<00:03:12.640> has

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
old-fashioned about the way this car has

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.240 
old-fashioned about the way this car has
been<00:03:12.940> engineered<00:03:13.620> rather<00:03:14.620> than<00:03:14.770> building<00:03:15.160> a

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
been engineered rather than building a

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.580 
been engineered rather than building a
separate<00:03:15.790> model<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.600> company<00:03:16.990> has<00:03:17.140> built<00:03:17.320> the

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
separate model the company has built the

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.680 
separate model the company has built the
golf<00:03:17.860> to<00:03:18.220> be<00:03:18.250> able<00:03:18.400> to<00:03:18.550> take<00:03:18.760> on<00:03:18.970> a<00:03:19.000> battery<00:03:19.480> and

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
golf to be able to take on a battery and

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.740 
golf to be able to take on a battery and
electric<00:03:20.230> motor<00:03:20.500> with<00:03:20.860> little<00:03:21.220> trouble<00:03:21.750> so

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
electric motor with little trouble so

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.390 
electric motor with little trouble so
just<00:03:23.260> in<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:23.410> same<00:03:23.590> way<00:03:23.650> you<00:03:23.860> might<00:03:24.130> choose

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
just in the same way you might choose

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.060 
just in the same way you might choose
between<00:03:24.670> a<00:03:24.820> petrol<00:03:25.270> car<00:03:25.300> or<00:03:25.870> a<00:03:25.930> diesel<00:03:26.170> car<00:03:26.530> now

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
between a petrol car or a diesel car now

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.550 
between a petrol car or a diesel car now
you<00:03:27.130> cannot<00:03:27.520> for<00:03:27.730> electric<00:03:28.180> -<00:03:28.450> it<00:03:28.960> keeps<00:03:29.230> costs

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
you cannot for electric - it keeps costs

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.070 
you cannot for electric - it keeps costs
down<00:03:29.740> from<00:03:30.580> purchasing<00:03:31.120> through<00:03:31.540> to<00:03:31.690> repairs

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
down from purchasing through to repairs

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.020 
down from purchasing through to repairs
and<00:03:32.380> it<00:03:32.890> could<00:03:33.130> be<00:03:33.340> a<00:03:33.370> good<00:03:33.640> model<00:03:33.910> for

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
and it could be a good model for

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:42.380 
and it could be a good model for
manufacturers<00:03:34.870> to<00:03:34.930> copy<00:03:35.290> in<00:03:35.560> the<00:03:35.800> future
