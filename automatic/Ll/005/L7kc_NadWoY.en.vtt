00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
the reason that i'm not having any food

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.149 
the reason that i'm not having any food
is<00:01:54.570> because<00:01:54.840> I'm<00:01:54.929> how<00:01:55.079> about<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.439> do<00:01:55.649> some

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
is because I'm how about to do some

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.359 
is because I'm how about to do some
exercise<00:01:56.789> and<00:01:57.350> when<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.469> do<00:01:58.619> exercise<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.340> the

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
exercise and when you do exercise in the

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.370 
exercise and when you do exercise in the
morning<00:01:59.490> you<00:02:00.030> really<00:02:00.359> ideally<00:02:00.869> want<00:02:01.020> an<00:02:01.109> empty

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
morning you really ideally want an empty

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.630 
morning you really ideally want an empty
stomach<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.890> reason<00:02:02.189> for<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.520> because

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
stomach the reason for that is because

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.719 
stomach the reason for that is because
you'll<00:02:02.999> be<00:02:03.060> low<00:02:03.359> on<00:02:03.390> carbs<00:02:04.079> so<00:02:04.829> if<00:02:05.249> your<00:02:05.460> body's

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
you'll be low on carbs so if your body's

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.359 
you'll be low on carbs so if your body's
low<00:02:05.880> on<00:02:05.939> carbs<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.689> has<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.679> doesn't<00:02:08.009> use<00:02:08.160> them

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
low on carbs it has it doesn't use them

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.490 
low on carbs it has it doesn't use them
as<00:02:08.490> a<00:02:08.520> fuel<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:08.970> burn<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.600> it<00:02:09.960> will<00:02:10.050> kick<00:02:10.259> into

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
as a fuel to burn and it will kick into

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.490 
as a fuel to burn and it will kick into
fats<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.580> lot<00:02:11.760> quicker<00:02:11.940> so<00:02:12.330> but<00:02:12.720> kind<00:02:13.080> of<00:02:13.200> you

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
fats a lot quicker so but kind of you

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.620 
fats a lot quicker so but kind of you
after<00:02:13.710> you<00:02:13.860> already<00:02:14.370> do<00:02:14.550> have<00:02:14.850> and<00:02:15.390> then<00:02:15.510> on

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
after you already do have and then on

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.030 
after you already do have and then on
something<00:02:15.990> I'll<00:02:16.050> kick<00:02:16.260> into<00:02:16.440> fat<00:02:16.740> whereas

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
something I'll kick into fat whereas

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
so deprived of carbs is actually now

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.730 
so deprived of carbs is actually now
starting<00:05:03.360> to<00:05:03.450> really<00:05:03.660> create<00:05:04.080> a<00:05:04.200> few<00:05:04.500> of<00:05:04.560> my

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740

belly's<00:05:05.130> rumblin<00:05:05.610> and<00:05:05.820> I<00:05:06.360> feel<00:05:06.600> really<00:05:06.630> hungry

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
belly's rumblin and I feel really hungry

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.100 
belly's rumblin and I feel really hungry
I<00:05:07.350> feel<00:05:07.590> really<00:05:07.860> weak<00:05:08.540> now<00:05:09.540> the<00:05:09.600> best<00:05:09.840> thing<00:05:09.960> to

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
I feel really weak now the best thing to

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.810 
I feel really weak now the best thing to
do<00:05:10.230> obviously<00:05:10.740> my<00:05:10.860> breakfast<00:05:11.250> I'm<00:05:11.430> not<00:05:11.580> having

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820
