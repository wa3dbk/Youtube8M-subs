so<00:00:01.639> here<00:00:02.639> we<00:00:02.730> are<00:00:02.760> inside<00:00:03.240> of<00:00:03.300> a<00:00:03.480> new<00:00:05.960> flash

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
so here we are inside of a new flash

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.990 
so here we are inside of a new flash
develop<00:00:07.440> window<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:08.340> think<00:00:08.820> you<00:00:09.660> may<00:00:09.929> have<00:00:09.960> a

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.000 
develop window I think you may have a

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.720 
develop window I think you may have a
couple<00:00:12.000> windows<00:00:12.360> open<00:00:12.990> kind<00:00:13.290> of<00:00:13.410> like<00:00:13.590> this

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.220 

like<00:00:17.730> that<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:17.940> think<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.359> have<00:00:18.510> an<00:00:18.600> output<00:00:18.750> in

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
like that I think you have an output in

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.130 
like that I think you have an output in
the<00:00:19.350> project<00:00:19.740> window<00:00:19.920> here<00:00:20.400> but<00:00:20.869> first<00:00:21.869> screen

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
the project window here but first screen

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.950 
the project window here but first screen
recording<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.769> just<00:00:23.490> hide<00:00:23.670> these<00:00:23.910> by<00:00:24.210> unpinning

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
recording I just hide these by unpinning

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.570 
recording I just hide these by unpinning
them<00:00:25.670> and<00:00:26.670> also<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:27.630> made<00:00:28.560> my<00:00:28.740> text<00:00:29.099> really<00:00:29.369> big

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
them and also I made my text really big

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.720 
them and also I made my text really big
so<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.630> it'll<00:00:31.019> be<00:00:31.109> easy<00:00:31.410> for<00:00:31.579> everyone<00:00:32.579> to

see but anyways let's get a very simple

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.889 
see but anyways let's get a very simple
project<00:00:38.629> put<00:00:39.629> together<00:00:40.489> inside<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.899> flash

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
project put together inside of flash

project name will be the same the file

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.600 
project name will be the same the file
that<00:02:00.149> opens<00:02:00.299> up<00:02:00.630> flash<00:02:01.020> develop<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:02.430> let's

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
that opens up flash develop so let's

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.280 
that opens up flash develop so let's
click<00:02:02.850> OK

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:11.400 

Oh<00:02:06.870> Oh<00:02:07.870> No<00:02:08.830> yeah<00:02:09.130> that's<00:02:09.430> alright<00:02:09.580> so<00:02:10.060> I<00:02:10.410> think

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
Oh Oh No yeah that's alright so I think

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.890 
Oh Oh No yeah that's alright so I think
I<00:02:11.680> have<00:02:11.830> something<00:02:12.100> set<00:02:12.550> up<00:02:12.670> already<00:02:12.910> but

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
I have something set up already but

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.560 
I have something set up already but
let's<00:02:14.560> just<00:02:14.830> go<00:02:15.040> over<00:02:15.130> first<00:02:15.970> how<00:02:16.240> to<00:02:16.270> bring

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
let's just go over first how to bring

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.880 
let's just go over first how to bring
Flixel<00:02:17.260> in<00:02:18.390> so<00:02:19.390> under<00:02:19.960> your<00:02:20.050> project<00:02:20.530> you'll

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
Flixel in so under your project you'll

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.850 
Flixel in so under your project you'll
go<00:02:21.070> to<00:02:21.130> properties<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:23.380> there<00:02:23.650> are<00:02:23.770> a<00:02:23.800> couple

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
go to properties and there are a couple

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.660 
go to properties and there are a couple
ways<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.730> get<00:02:25.150> that<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:26.170> get<00:02:26.260> Flixel<00:02:26.710> brought

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
ways to get that to get Flixel brought

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.500 
ways to get that to get Flixel brought
in<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.600> first<00:02:28.960> is<00:02:29.260> to<00:02:29.800> just<00:02:30.250> add<00:02:30.460> a<00:02:30.490> class<00:02:31.180> path

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
in the first is to just add a class path

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.420 
in the first is to just add a class path
for<00:02:31.930> this<00:02:32.230> project<00:02:32.520> so<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:34.840> also<00:02:35.830> you<00:02:36.040> can<00:02:36.310> do

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
for this project so and also you can do

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.800 
for this project so and also you can do
a<00:02:36.460> global<00:02:37.090> class<00:02:37.330> class<00:02:37.900> path<00:02:38.200> which<00:02:38.770> will<00:02:39.810> be

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
a global class class path which will be

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.650 
a global class class path which will be
available<00:02:41.350> for<00:02:41.650> all<00:02:42.180> projects<00:02:43.180> that<00:02:43.330> you<00:02:43.450> make

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
available for all projects that you make

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.260 
available for all projects that you make
I<00:02:44.410> don't<00:02:44.590> know<00:02:44.890> if<00:02:44.980> there's<00:02:45.310> any<00:02:45.640> difference

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
I don't know if there's any difference

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.990 
I don't know if there's any difference
if<00:02:47.400> it<00:02:48.400> effects<00:02:49.030> if<00:02:49.390> it's<00:02:49.630> included<00:02:50.850> like<00:02:51.850> if

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
if it effects if it's included like if

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.880 
if it effects if it's included like if
you<00:02:52.090> don't<00:02:52.300> use<00:02:52.570> Flixel<00:02:53.050> at<00:02:53.110> all<00:02:53.230> if<00:02:53.530> it<00:02:53.620> still

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
you don't use Flixel at all if it still

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.920 
you don't use Flixel at all if it still
puts<00:02:54.070> it<00:02:54.220> in<00:02:54.340> there<00:02:54.520> so<00:02:55.270> if<00:02:55.420> anyone<00:02:55.720> knows

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
puts it in there so if anyone knows

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.340 
puts it in there so if anyone knows
please<00:02:57.060> let<00:02:58.060> me<00:02:58.180> know<00:02:58.330> if<00:02:58.750> there's<00:02:59.170> any

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
please let me know if there's any

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.699 
please let me know if there's any
difference<00:02:59.500> I<00:02:59.920> prefer<00:03:00.990> using<00:03:01.990> global<00:03:02.500> class

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
difference I prefer using global class

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.590 
difference I prefer using global class
paths<00:03:03.100> because<00:03:03.370> if<00:03:03.760> I'm<00:03:03.970> doing<00:03:04.450> any

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
paths because if I'm doing any

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.680 
paths because if I'm doing any
ActionScript<00:03:05.320> 3<00:03:05.709> I'm<00:03:06.220> most<00:03:06.910> likely<00:03:07.120> using

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
ActionScript 3 I'm most likely using

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.110 
ActionScript 3 I'm most likely using
Flixel<00:03:08.320> so<00:03:08.950> I<00:03:08.980> just<00:03:09.400> put<00:03:09.550> it<00:03:09.610> in<00:03:09.670> there<00:03:09.820> but

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
Flixel so I just put it in there but

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.180 
Flixel so I just put it in there but
here's<00:03:10.450> how<00:03:10.630> you<00:03:10.690> do<00:03:10.840> it<00:03:10.959> let's<00:03:11.530> assume<00:03:11.860> that

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
here's how you do it let's assume that

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.130 
here's how you do it let's assume that
you<00:03:12.310> don't<00:03:12.550> have<00:03:12.790> this<00:03:13.060> here<00:03:13.390> so<00:03:13.600> let's<00:03:13.780> remove

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
you don't have this here so let's remove

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:20.550 
you don't have this here so let's remove
that<00:03:14.520> so<00:03:15.780> you'll<00:03:16.780> go<00:03:17.110> to<00:03:17.370> global<00:03:19.290> as3<00:03:20.290> class

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
that so you'll go to global as3 class

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.620 
that so you'll go to global as3 class
paths<00:03:20.860> make<00:03:21.489> sure<00:03:21.670> it's<00:03:21.850> on<00:03:21.940> a<00:03:22.000> nexus<00:03:22.360> crip

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
paths make sure it's on a nexus crip

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.930 
paths make sure it's on a nexus crip
degree<00:03:22.959> and<00:03:23.230> you'll<00:03:23.739> click<00:03:24.070> add<00:03:24.310> class<00:03:24.670> path

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
degree and you'll click add class path

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.370 
degree and you'll click add class path
then<00:03:25.930> you<00:03:26.590> will<00:03:26.739> navigate<00:03:27.360> to<00:03:28.360> where<00:03:28.660> we<00:03:29.019> saved

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
then you will navigate to where we saved

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.580 
then you will navigate to where we saved

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
so now let's oh yeah when you make a new

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.570 
so now let's oh yeah when you make a new
project<00:03:57.580> it<00:03:57.880> gives<00:03:58.060> you<00:03:58.209> this<00:03:58.390> main

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
project it gives you this main

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
to check and see if we have flixel

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.280 
to check and see if we have flixel

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.150 
oops import flixel flash developers very
smart<00:04:23.790> so<00:04:24.150> if<00:04:24.480> you<00:04:24.600> just<00:04:24.780> start<00:04:25.260> typing<00:04:25.470> flick

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
smart so if you just start typing flick

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.930 
smart so if you just start typing flick
so<00:04:26.550> as<00:04:27.350> you<00:04:28.350> can<00:04:28.500> see<00:04:28.650> here<00:04:28.920> it<00:04:29.040> already<00:04:29.250> does

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
so as you can see here it already does

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.520 
so as you can see here it already does
everything<00:04:30.300> for<00:04:30.930> you<00:04:31.110> and<00:04:31.140> you<00:04:31.380> can<00:04:31.500> just

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
everything for you and you can just

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.020 
everything for you and you can just
click<00:04:31.890> one<00:04:32.070> of<00:04:32.100> these<00:04:32.280> and<00:04:33.770> then<00:04:34.820> make<00:04:35.820> it<00:04:35.940> a

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
click one of these and then make it a

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.450 
click one of these and then make it a
star<00:04:36.300> so<00:04:37.050> that<00:04:37.200> way<00:04:37.350> it<00:04:37.500> brings<00:04:37.800> everything<00:04:38.130> in

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
star so that way it brings everything in

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.670 
star so that way it brings everything in
or<00:04:38.940> you<00:04:39.630> could<00:04:39.720> do<00:04:39.870> it<00:04:39.900> the<00:04:40.080> old-fashioned<00:04:40.650> way

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
or you could do it the old-fashioned way

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.660 
or you could do it the old-fashioned way
and<00:04:40.830> start<00:04:41.370> with<00:04:41.850> the<00:04:42.000> Borg<00:04:42.620> dot<00:04:43.620> and<00:04:44.400> then

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
and start with the Borg dot and then

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.550 
and start with the Borg dot and then
here<00:04:44.910> we<00:04:45.000> have<00:04:45.030> Flixel<00:04:45.570> see<00:04:45.870> it's<00:04:46.050> very<00:04:46.230> smart

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
here we have Flixel see it's very smart

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.860 
here we have Flixel see it's very smart
it<00:04:46.710> knows<00:04:46.860> what<00:04:47.250> we<00:04:47.370> want<00:04:47.580> clicks<00:04:48.570> a<00:04:48.660> little

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
it knows what we want clicks a little

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.920 
it knows what we want clicks a little
dot<00:04:49.740> and<00:04:50.520> then<00:04:50.670> if<00:04:51.060> we<00:04:51.180> wanted<00:04:51.450> to<00:04:51.510> bring<00:04:51.720> in<00:04:51.900> a

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
dot and then if we wanted to bring in a

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.630 
dot and then if we wanted to bring in a
specific<00:04:52.350> piece<00:04:53.160> we<00:04:53.430> could<00:04:55.280> but<00:04:56.280> for<00:04:56.520> now

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
specific piece we could but for now

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:05.890 
specific piece we could but for now
let's<00:04:57.030> just<00:04:57.150> bring<00:04:57.660> in<00:04:58.050> everything<00:05:02.510> with<00:05:03.510> star

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
let's just bring in everything with star

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.340 
let's just bring in everything with star
so<00:05:06.900> we<00:05:07.260> know<00:05:08.130> that<00:05:08.160> flixel<00:05:08.790> is<00:05:09.000> in<00:05:09.240> because<00:05:09.660> the

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
so we know that flixel is in because the

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.580 
so we know that flixel is in because the
flash<00:05:11.250> develop<00:05:12.290> sod

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
flash develop sod

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
flash develop sod
but<00:05:14.370> next<00:05:14.580> let's<00:05:14.880> bring<00:05:15.090> in<00:05:15.360> nape<00:05:16.230> so<00:05:17.160> once

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
but next let's bring in nape so once

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.120 
but next let's bring in nape so once
again<00:05:17.760> in<00:05:17.910> our<00:05:18.000> project<00:05:18.510> I<00:05:19.170> think<00:05:19.740> you<00:05:19.830> can<00:05:19.980> do

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
again in our project I think you can do

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.000 
again in our project I think you can do
this<00:05:20.310> in<00:05:20.520> any<00:05:20.670> of<00:05:20.850> these<00:05:20.970> folders<00:05:21.480> but<00:05:22.380> I<00:05:22.620> think

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
this in any of these folders but I think

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.550 
this in any of these folders but I think
this<00:05:23.250> Li<00:05:23.790> B<00:05:24.030> folder<00:05:24.480> is<00:05:24.540> specifically<00:05:25.290> made

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
this Li B folder is specifically made

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.260 
this Li B folder is specifically made
for<00:05:25.590> this<00:05:25.910> for<00:05:26.910> bringing<00:05:27.510> libraries<00:05:28.260> and<00:05:28.500> so

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
for this for bringing libraries and so

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.630 
for this for bringing libraries and so
let's<00:05:30.270> right-click<00:05:31.110> on<00:05:31.590> that<00:05:31.650> folder<00:05:32.370> or<00:05:32.580> I

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
let's right-click on that folder or I

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.310 
let's right-click on that folder or I
guess<00:05:33.030> any<00:05:33.180> of<00:05:33.270> these<00:05:33.390> folders<00:05:33.630> is<00:05:33.990> okay

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
guess any of these folders is okay

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.760 
guess any of these folders is okay
actually

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
actually

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:40.630 
actually
but<00:05:35.600> click<00:05:36.600> Add<00:05:36.810> and<00:05:37.350> then<00:05:38.120> library<00:05:39.120> asset

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
but click Add and then library asset

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.210 
but click Add and then library asset
then<00:05:41.640> we<00:05:41.970> will<00:05:42.300> once<00:05:42.480> again<00:05:42.920> navigate<00:05:43.920> to

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
then we will once again navigate to

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.020 
then we will once again navigate to
where<00:05:44.370> we<00:05:44.640> downloaded<00:05:45.510> nape<00:05:45.870> which<00:05:46.170> was<00:05:47.100> slash

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
where we downloaded nape which was slash

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.030 
where we downloaded nape which was slash
libraries<00:05:48.780> and<00:05:48.960> such<00:05:49.110> and<00:05:49.410> then<00:05:49.560> here<00:05:49.770> we<00:05:49.860> have

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.040 
libraries and such and then here we have

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.740 
libraries and such and then here we have
the<00:05:50.820> nape<00:05:51.270> that<00:05:51.540> we<00:05:51.860> downloaded<00:05:53.330> right<00:05:54.330> there

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
the nape that we downloaded right there

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.380 
the nape that we downloaded right there
and<00:05:54.920> if<00:05:55.920> you<00:05:56.010> look<00:05:56.160> at<00:05:56.250> your<00:05:56.370> project<00:05:56.580> again

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
and if you look at your project again

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.230 
and if you look at your project again
under<00:05:57.960> that<00:05:58.110> Lib<00:05:58.770> folder<00:05:59.070> we<00:05:59.460> have<00:05:59.490> nape<00:05:59.910> and

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
under that Lib folder we have nape and

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.180 
under that Lib folder we have nape and
it<00:06:00.690> should<00:06:01.020> be<00:06:01.170> highlighted<00:06:01.680> blue<00:06:01.860> which

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
it should be highlighted blue which

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.120 
it should be highlighted blue which
means<00:06:02.520> that<00:06:02.790> it's<00:06:03.170> using<00:06:04.170> it<00:06:04.260> essentially<00:06:04.950> and

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
means that it's using it essentially and

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.470 
means that it's using it essentially and
you<00:06:05.210> can<00:06:06.210> see<00:06:06.360> all<00:06:06.480> the<00:06:06.770> stuff<00:06:07.770> that's<00:06:08.010> inside

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:08.480 
you can see all the stuff that's inside

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.350 
you can see all the stuff that's inside
so<00:06:09.500> that's<00:06:10.500> what<00:06:10.740> this<00:06:10.830> swc<00:06:11.700> is<00:06:11.940> it's<00:06:12.210> a

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
so that's what this swc is it's a

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.570 
so that's what this swc is it's a
library<00:06:13.020> asset<00:06:13.440> night<00:06:13.740> I<00:06:13.980> believe

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
library asset night I believe

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.340 
library asset night I believe
maybe<00:06:15.420> it's<00:06:16.220> compiled<00:06:17.220> already<00:06:17.580> so<00:06:18.540> maybe

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:19.350 
maybe it's compiled already so maybe

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.890 
maybe it's compiled already so maybe
that<00:06:19.620> makes<00:06:20.130> compiling<00:06:20.730> faster<00:06:21.330> but<00:06:21.660> you

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
that makes compiling faster but you

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.770 
that makes compiling faster but you
know<00:06:22.200> I<00:06:22.230> really<00:06:22.590> don't<00:06:22.770> know<00:06:22.920> so

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 
know I really don't know so

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.020 
know I really don't know so
so<00:06:25.680> when<00:06:25.860> out<00:06:26.190> there<00:06:26.340> knows<00:06:26.520> let<00:06:26.789> me<00:06:26.880> know

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.030 
so when out there knows let me know

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.510 
so when out there knows let me know
again<00:06:27.750> I'm<00:06:28.410> still<00:06:28.680> kind<00:06:28.889> of<00:06:28.949> new<00:06:29.099> at<00:06:29.160> all<00:06:29.250> this

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 
again I'm still kind of new at all this

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.939 
again I'm still kind of new at all this
but<00:06:30.330> anyways<00:06:30.630> once<00:06:31.050> again<00:06:31.289> we<00:06:31.410> can<00:06:31.560> check<00:06:31.770> it

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:31.949 
but anyways once again we can check it

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:35.360 
but anyways once again we can check it
by<00:06:32.150> importing<00:06:33.150> something<00:06:33.479> from<00:06:34.020> nape<00:06:34.740> so<00:06:35.220> if

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370 
by importing something from nape so if

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.900 
by importing something from nape so if
we<00:06:35.460> do<00:06:35.580> import<00:06:36.000> nape<00:06:36.840> and<00:06:37.800> as<00:06:38.370> you<00:06:38.550> can<00:06:38.669> see<00:06:38.789> we

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:38.910 
we do import nape and as you can see we

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.420 
we do import nape and as you can see we
have<00:06:39.030> all<00:06:39.210> the<00:06:39.360> nape<00:06:39.539> stuff<00:06:39.930> there<00:06:40.229> but<00:06:41.009> we

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:41.430 
have all the nape stuff there but we

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:42.830 
have all the nape stuff there but we
don't<00:06:41.610> really<00:06:41.729> need<00:06:41.970> to<00:06:42.030> bring<00:06:42.389> anything<00:06:42.599> in

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 
don't really need to bring anything in

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:49.670 
don't really need to bring anything in
right<00:06:43.050> now<00:06:43.460> and<00:06:44.460> actually<00:06:45.889> so<00:06:46.889> that's<00:06:47.819> it<00:06:48.680> we

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 
right now and actually so that's it we

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.860 
right now and actually so that's it we
have<00:06:49.710> everything<00:06:50.160> set<00:06:50.340> up<00:06:50.580> ready<00:06:50.910> to<00:06:51.030> go<00:06:51.120> to

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:51.870 
have everything set up ready to go to

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.719 
have everything set up ready to go to
start<00:06:52.139> making<00:06:52.590> some<00:06:53.069> games<00:06:53.370> so<00:06:55.400> let's<00:06:56.400> do<00:06:56.699> that

00:06:56.719 --> 00:06:56.729 
start making some games so let's do that

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:01.580 
start making some games so let's do that
in<00:06:57.120> the<00:06:57.330> next<00:06:57.479> episode<00:06:58.280> see<00:06:59.280> you<00:06:59.400> then
