articles all said it but the video had
it<00:03:07.470> right<00:03:07.590> at<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.709> beginning<00:03:07.829> okay<00:03:08.700> June<00:03:09.420> 29th

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
it right at the beginning okay June 29th

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:10.640 
it right at the beginning okay June 29th
2014

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
2014

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.099 
2014
that<00:03:11.220> up<00:03:11.430> where<00:03:11.790> that<00:03:11.819> was<00:03:12.450> in<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.870> scheme<00:03:13.079> of

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
that up where that was in the scheme of

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.780 
that up where that was in the scheme of
things<00:03:13.260> on<00:03:13.650> that<00:03:13.799> date<00:03:14.099> it<00:03:14.400> was<00:03:14.959> at<00:03:15.959> least<00:03:16.790> 160

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
things on that date it was at least 160

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.490 
things on that date it was at least 160
million<00:03:18.060> miles<00:03:18.450> away<00:03:18.660> which<00:03:19.019> i<00:03:19.139> think<00:03:19.200> is

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
million miles away which i think is

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.180 
million miles away which i think is
about<00:03:20.299> 1.7<00:03:21.299> times<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.680> sun<00:03:22.919> so<00:03:23.069> it's

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
about 1.7 times the sun so it's

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.120 
about 1.7 times the sun so it's
basically<00:03:23.630> us<00:03:24.630> where<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.410> Sun<00:03:25.620> is<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:26.040> then

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
basically us where the Sun is and then

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.729 
basically us where the Sun is and then
another<00:03:26.700> half<00:03:27.030> away<00:03:27.750> from<00:03:27.780> us<00:03:28.169> so<00:03:28.669> alright<00:03:29.669> we

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
another half away from us so alright we

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.849 
another half away from us so alright we
can't<00:03:31.739> get<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.819> good<00:03:33.540> picture<00:03:33.989> of<00:03:34.109> front<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:34.560> mean

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
can't get a good picture of front I mean

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.050 
can't get a good picture of front I mean
this<00:03:34.950> is<00:03:35.129> what<00:03:35.250> we're<00:03:35.400> getting<00:03:35.730> this<00:03:35.879> is<00:03:36.030> a

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
this is what we're getting this is a

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.000 
this is what we're getting this is a
computer-generated<00:03:36.810> model<00:03:37.440> but<00:03:37.709> you<00:03:37.829> can

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
computer-generated model but you can

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.680 
computer-generated model but you can
only<00:03:38.129> get<00:03:38.370> very<00:03:38.700> little<00:03:38.940> pictures<00:03:39.359> from<00:03:39.540> Earth

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
only get very little pictures from Earth

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.690 
only get very little pictures from Earth
so<00:03:40.169> if<00:03:40.230> we<00:03:40.319> don't<00:03:40.560> have<00:03:40.739> any<00:03:41.010> asked<00:03:41.400> we<00:03:41.579> don't

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
so if we don't have any asked we don't

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.360 
so if we don't have any asked we don't
have<00:03:41.819> any<00:03:41.940> satellites<00:03:42.359> flying<00:03:42.510> by<00:03:42.750> right<00:03:43.049> now

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
have any satellites flying by right now

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.979 
have any satellites flying by right now
India<00:03:44.370> surely<00:03:44.819> doesn't<00:03:45.000> and<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.329> Neos<00:03:45.660> that

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
India surely doesn't and the Neos that

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.650 
India surely doesn't and the Neos that
Neos<00:03:46.889> at<00:03:47.160> is<00:03:47.400> definitely<00:03:47.819> Canadian<00:03:48.209> satellite

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
Neos at is definitely Canadian satellite

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.280

know this video and all these pictures

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.020 
know this video and all these pictures
of<00:04:36.720> it<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.380> resolution<00:04:38.100> is<00:04:38.310> of<00:04:38.640> something

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
of it the resolution is of something

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.550 
of it the resolution is of something
that<00:04:39.180> would<00:04:39.270> have<00:04:39.360> been<00:04:39.390> flying<00:04:39.720> by<00:04:39.990> somebody

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
that would have been flying by somebody

then they went put them on they put them

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.640 
then they went put them on they put them
on<00:04:47.120> basically<00:04:48.120> made<00:04:48.840> a<00:04:48.870> video<00:04:49.170> out<00:04:49.380> of<00:04:49.410> it

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
on basically made a video out of it

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.140 
on basically made a video out of it
stuck<00:04:49.800> it<00:04:49.950> out<00:04:50.040> but<00:04:50.280> it's<00:04:50.400> that<00:04:50.520> easy<00:04:50.730> to<00:04:50.970> fool

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150

legit with everybody as much as I
possibly<00:05:01.950> can<00:05:02.520> so<00:05:02.550> those<00:05:03.360> are<00:05:03.480> the<00:05:03.570> least<00:05:03.750> of

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
possibly can so those are the least of

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.140 
possibly can so those are the least of
five<00:05:04.080> reasons<00:05:04.500> I<00:05:04.590> see<00:05:05.070> that<00:05:05.700> are<00:05:05.820> messed<00:05:06.000> up

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
yourself you can but we're not getting

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.300 
yourself you can but we're not getting
that<00:05:15.630> high<00:05:15.810> resolution<00:05:16.050> from<00:05:16.770> any<00:05:17.070> of<00:05:17.220> these

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
that high resolution from any of these

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.610 
that high resolution from any of these
satellites<00:05:17.820> so<00:05:18.150> and<00:05:18.419> one<00:05:19.020> day<00:05:19.260> we're<00:05:19.470> going<00:05:19.560> to

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
satellites so and one day we're going to

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.550 
satellites so and one day we're going to
be<00:05:19.710> sending<00:05:19.890> out<00:05:21.020> you<00:05:22.020> know<00:05:22.110> there's<00:05:22.290> a<00:05:22.350> lot<00:05:22.470> of
