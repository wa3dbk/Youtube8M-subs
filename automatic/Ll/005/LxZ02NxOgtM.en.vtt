00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
reverse around the corner so I'm

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.399 
reverse around the corner so I'm
perfectly<00:01:07.210> satisfied<00:01:07.750> there<00:01:08.080> doesn't<00:01:08.380> seem

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409

the back window and in the side window

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.039 
the back window and in the side window
okay<00:01:15.729> now<00:01:15.850> there<00:01:16.149> is<00:01:16.240> a<00:01:16.270> car<00:01:16.540> approaching

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
they're turning so I'm just going to

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.399 
they're turning so I'm just going to
stop<00:01:18.460> as<00:01:18.670> they<00:01:18.790> approach<00:01:19.090> look<00:01:19.930> around<00:01:20.229> again

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
stop as they approach look around again

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.050

the<00:01:22.540> speed<00:01:22.840> you<00:01:22.960> want<00:01:23.049> to<00:01:23.170> be<00:01:23.259> doing<00:01:23.470> this<00:01:23.619> out

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
the speed you want to be doing this out

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:25.620 
the speed you want to be doing this out
generally<00:01:24.250> is<00:01:24.340> a<00:01:24.369> good<00:01:25.000> way<00:01:25.149> to<00:01:25.210> put<00:01:25.420> it<00:01:25.479> as

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
generally is a good way to put it as

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.719 
generally is a good way to put it as
maybe<00:01:25.780> at<00:01:25.960> a<00:01:25.990> walking<00:01:26.320> pace<00:01:26.530> if<00:01:26.979> you<00:01:27.430> notice

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
maybe at a walking pace if you notice

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.760 
maybe at a walking pace if you notice
I'm<00:01:27.850> looking<00:01:28.149> at<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.390> back<00:01:28.509> window<00:01:28.990> and<00:01:29.140> using

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
I'm looking at the back window and using

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.800 
I'm looking at the back window and using
my<00:01:29.890> side<00:01:30.159> mirror<00:01:30.430> the<00:01:30.880> side<00:01:31.119> mirror<00:01:31.420> would<00:01:31.600> not

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
my side mirror the side mirror would not

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.230 
my side mirror the side mirror would not
be<00:01:31.990> sufficient<00:01:32.200> on<00:01:32.619> its<00:01:32.649> own<00:01:33.000> when<00:01:34.000> I<00:01:34.030> get<00:01:34.210> a

be sufficient on its own when I get a

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.929 
be sufficient on its own when I get a
bit<00:01:34.390> halfway<00:01:35.189> because<00:01:36.189> the<00:01:36.340> phone<00:01:36.549> to<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:36.759> car

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
bit halfway because the phone to the car

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.819 
bit halfway because the phone to the car
is<00:01:37.090> kicking<00:01:37.420> out<00:01:37.539> slightly<00:01:37.869> I'm<00:01:38.500> just<00:01:38.710> going

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
is kicking out slightly I'm just going

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:41.520 
is kicking out slightly I'm just going
to<00:01:38.890> stop<00:01:39.130> knock<00:01:39.520> everywhere<00:01:40.000> again<00:01:40.530> once

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
to stop knock everywhere again once

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.899 
to stop knock everywhere again once
again<00:01:41.619> I'm<00:01:41.890> perfectly<00:01:42.250> satisfied<00:01:42.759> that

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
again I'm perfectly satisfied that

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.310 
again I'm perfectly satisfied that
there's<00:01:43.090> no<00:01:43.240> cars<00:01:43.570> coming<00:01:43.960> or<00:01:44.170> any

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
park position as I said already people

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.670 
park position as I said already people
do<00:01:58.030> have<00:01:58.450> a<00:01:58.509> lot<00:01:58.659> of<00:01:58.780> difficulty<00:01:59.200> with<00:01:59.229> this<00:01:59.469> if

you if you're out a little bit I
wouldn't<00:02:01.509> be<00:02:01.600> too<00:02:01.840> worried<00:02:02.170> just<00:02:02.469> try<00:02:02.680> and

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
wouldn't be too worried just try and

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.880 
wouldn't be too worried just try and
park<00:02:03.070> the<00:02:03.250> car<00:02:03.460> quite<00:02:03.729> well<00:02:03.909> at<00:02:04.000> the<00:02:04.119> end<00:02:04.890> okay
