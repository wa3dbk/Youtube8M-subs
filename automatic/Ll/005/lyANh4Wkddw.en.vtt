00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:39.059
 in the pre-Hispanic world in Mesoamerica 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:43.539
 the mountains had a great importance 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:46.180
 they were sacred places where they 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:48.789
 he believed he deposited a lot of 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.909
 water and all the goods that were the 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:54.430
 men were what they called some in 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:58.930
 the local a place a kind of Eden 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.969
 they call the first chroniclers in 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.309
 reality was a sacred space a 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:06.940
 Living space in general the mountains 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:09.429
 they had name they had gender they had power 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.679
 about the fate of men then 

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:16.420
 when we are here walking we are 

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:18.790
 walking on something alive were actually 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.299
 very important in the worldview 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.299
 Mesoamerican 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.070
 Y 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.820
 the first friars that begin to 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.640
 realize this from the 6th century are by 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.010
 sahagun example that narrates in concrete of 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.410
 these gaps that there were offerings in the 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.380
 water and that was a place where people 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:44.670
 he came on pilgrimages and for the century 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.430
 17 there are some writings of chroniclers that 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.770
 they talk about people who came to drink water and 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.650
 I was taking that water to your milpa to have 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.530
 a good harvest or even the case of 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.920
 a very daring Indian who comes to look 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:02.760
 idols and gets to put an idol to 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.580
 tabernacle with which there is a tremor and 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:09.080
 everybody panics and they take out the 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.080
 idol and then it is the tremor 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.590
 there are some some sources not of 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.989
 all reliable but but they exist that 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.299
 that here they were sacrificed in talk 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.860
 children to tlaloc in our jobs 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.709
 archaeological we have not met with 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.720
 that kind of archaeological remains without 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.519
 However we do not rule out that it is a 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.879
 possibility because if we know that in 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.110
 other points of geography 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:37.319
 prehispanic are carried out this type 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.409
 of sacrifices now we are going towards the 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.180
 snow crater of toluca the most part 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:45.810
 high where the two lagoons meet 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.440
 and where will I show you the places where 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.440
 we have worked 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.200
 we are inside the crater of 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.900
 snow-covered toluca in the lake of the sun 4200 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.750
 meters above sea level here in 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.180
 the 50s began the explorations 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:22.120
 by the men's club frogs of 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:25.219
 mexico with scuba and they started to find 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.349
 various pre-Hispanic offerings and 

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:29.629
 they started doing dives really 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:32.689
 without the awareness that they were 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:35.359
 diving in height and learned to 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:37.549
 lasted a bit were the museums the 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:40.040
 first museums in height that 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:42.739
 they did and it's in the 70s that 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:47.319
 precisely our chief the archaeologist 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:51.280
 pillar luna taking her diving course 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:55.180
 it comes to be your part 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.459
 of high water and realizes that 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.430
 the divers are looting the place that 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:03.160
 they are taking huge amounts of 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.250
 cup to the object wooden objects serpent 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.880
 reports and other things and then it's 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:13.180
 when the idea of ​​doing 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.840
 some time an underwater project in 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:19.109
 these gaps during the 80s the 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:24.180
 archaeologist otto schöndube on a walk 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:26.130
 down the slopes in that area over there 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.840
 of a stone that has some 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.620
 particular characteristics and 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.690
 approaching realizes that it is a wake 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:38.310
 a decapitated wake 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:39.700
 that has a character with a symbol 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.480
 solar 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:45.970
 and well then that adds another 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:49.890
 dimension to the interest to do 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.890
 archeology in the snow-covered of toluca 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.210
 value 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:09.479
 good we are on the south shore 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.849
 from the lagoon of the moon this lagoon 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:16.099
 It has approximately 10 12 meters of 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:16.099
 very clear water depth 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:22.080
 a temperature of 6 7 degrees 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:24.210
 approximately in 2007 we came and 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.880
 We started a series of trips to 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:30.440
 different levels of level covering all 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.840
 the northern portion of the lagoon 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.160
 through the three field seasons 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:39.190
 what we have done here in the new 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:42.650
 outlook 2007 of 2010 and 2012 we have 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.810
 documented a series of very objects 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.300
 interesting in the water as are the 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.430
 called centers the centers rays 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.740
 snake and they are extremely 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.690
 interesting because this type of objects 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:57.230
 of wood are not susceptible to 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:06:01.940
 to remain in a terrestrial environment is 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:04.330
 the cold water and the acidity of the water that has 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:08.930
 allowed its conservation also 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:12.380
 we record a lot of objects 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:14.450
 of copal spheres cones and some 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.880
 these figurines are very interesting 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:20.060
 because they reinforce the ritual character of 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.040
 this site were not used in the in 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.380
 the offerings and the interesting thing is that not 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:27.740
 they burned him but they offered him for 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:30.050
 so to say virgin as part of the rites 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:33.169
 that were carried out here equally 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:36.379
 a lot of maguey tips 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:39.630
 around 200 that were used in 

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:43.530
 the cars your buildings we believe 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:47.040
 what is on land in the northern part is 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:50.460
 located part of a structure we can 

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:53.490
 suppose there was some kind of 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:57.380
 structure that was central to the ritual 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:57.380
 because there is a lot of pottery 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:06.380
 one of the first questions that 

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:08.690
 we had around this great site 

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:12.610
 archaeological that takes to toluca was 

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:16.009
 what peoples came to do their rites 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:17.210
 prayers and at what times did the 

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:19.699
 most of the materials 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:22.130
 they correspond to the classic post especially 

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:23.900
 late classic in terms of 

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:28.630
 ceramics for example is this one 

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:31.480
 matlaltzinca and azteca 234 

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:33.660
 the pottery the Aztec pottery 

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:37.060
 it is practically all of a ritual nature 

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:41.920
 we found braziers censer 

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:45.370
 incense cajetes glasses 

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:47.800
 practically everything is ritual and good 

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:49.930
 because all this reinforces this question 

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:53.280
 of the ritual character of the Toluca snow 

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:57.570
 what they probably went up to do 

00:07:53.280 --> 00:08:00.640
 requests for rain and all this kind of 

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:02.500
 rituals that serve agriculture that 

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:07.440
 serving 

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:07.440
 to have a good a good harvest 

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.120
 do not 

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.080
 low
