decline Harvard researchers have come up

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.360 
decline Harvard researchers have come up
with<00:00:06.480> an<00:00:06.990> excellent<00:00:07.680> solution<00:00:08.420> robot<00:00:09.420> bees

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370 
with an excellent solution robot bees

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.810 
with an excellent solution robot bees
bees<00:00:11.370> that<00:00:11.820> are<00:00:12.120> robots<00:00:12.769> obviously<00:00:13.820> they

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
bees that are robots obviously they

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.109 
bees that are robots obviously they
operate<00:00:15.330> like<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.900> regular<00:00:16.230> bead<00:00:16.910> except<00:00:17.910> no

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
operate like a regular bead except no

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.590 
operate like a regular bead except no
stingers<00:00:18.570> that's<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:19.020> plus<00:00:19.580> so<00:00:20.580> it's<00:00:20.880> it's<00:00:21.210> more

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
stingers that's a plus so it's it's more

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.200 
stingers that's a plus so it's it's more
to<00:00:22.020> really<00:00:22.560> operate<00:00:23.130> like<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.400> regular<00:00:23.730> beam

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
to really operate like a regular beam

they<00:00:24.570> pollinate<00:00:25.199> Tim<00:00:25.680> they<00:00:26.340> will<00:00:26.730> take<00:00:26.910> over

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
they pollinate Tim they will take over

they pollinate Tim they will take over
the<00:00:27.269> pollinating<00:00:27.750> functions<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.410> our<00:00:28.590> bees

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
the pollinating functions of our bees

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.970 
the pollinating functions of our bees
that<00:00:28.949> are<00:00:29.179> dying<00:00:30.179> off<00:00:30.449> we<00:00:31.230> said<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.830> bees

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
that are dying off we said the bees

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.569 
that are dying off we said the bees
we<00:00:32.340> need<00:00:32.550> our<00:00:32.700> plants<00:00:33.410> may<00:00:34.410> be<00:00:34.469> restoring<00:00:35.399> the

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
we need our plants may be restoring the

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.610 
we need our plants may be restoring the
bee<00:00:35.700> population<00:00:35.730> wasn't<00:00:36.630> working<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.230> a

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
bee population wasn't working so a

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.680 
bee population wasn't working so a
robotics<00:00:38.280> team<00:00:38.550> did<00:00:38.790> what<00:00:38.940> they<00:00:39.149> could<00:00:39.180> in

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
robotics team did what they could in

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.810 
robotics team did what they could in
their<00:00:40.020> capacity<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.710> solve<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.250> problem<00:00:41.700> now

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820

for<00:00:42.059> number<00:00:42.149> one<00:00:42.510> no<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.379> selfish<00:00:43.890> we<00:00:44.070> need

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
for number one no so selfish we need

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.709 
for number one no so selfish we need
those<00:00:44.460> plants<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.059> world<00:00:45.270> needs<00:00:45.539> those

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
those plants the world needs those

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.020 
those plants the world needs those
plants<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.920> let's<00:00:47.129> announce<00:00:47.370> our<00:00:47.579> swarm<00:00:47.940> of

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
plants so let's announce our swarm of

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.840 
plants so let's announce our swarm of
robot<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.570> tell<00:00:48.719> me<00:00:48.840> about<00:00:48.899> robot<00:00:49.260> bees<00:00:49.440> so

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
robot to tell me about robot bees so

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.610 
robot to tell me about robot bees so
robot<00:00:50.850> bees<00:00:51.090> it's<00:00:51.780> pretty<00:00:51.989> cool<00:00:52.230> how<00:00:52.469> they

but it is a refueling station or a

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.920 
but it is a refueling station or a
recharging<00:01:32.040> station<00:01:32.450> would<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.479> freak<00:01:33.780> out

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
recharging station would you freak out

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.469 
recharging station would you freak out
if<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.409> saw<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.890> robot<00:01:35.310> be<00:01:35.460> flying<00:01:35.790> around<00:01:35.909> from

tell me more everything we don't need
anymore<00:01:45.390> let's<00:01:45.689> make<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.840> robot<00:01:46.049> out<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.350> it

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
anymore let's make a robot out of it

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.859 
anymore let's make a robot out of it
like<00:01:46.740> what<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.340> don't<00:01:47.610> know<00:01:47.670> all<00:01:48.210> things<00:01:48.570> that

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
like what I don't know all things that

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.870 
like what I don't know all things that
do<00:01:48.960> things<00:01:49.229> for<00:01:49.470> us<00:01:49.590> all<00:01:50.040> kinds<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.399> bugs<00:01:50.549> well

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
do things for us all kinds of bugs well

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.609 
do things for us all kinds of bugs well
let's<00:01:51.180> make<00:01:51.329> all<00:01:51.600> bugs<00:01:51.869> without<00:01:52.200> stingers

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
let's make all bugs without stingers

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.319 
let's make all bugs without stingers
they're<00:01:54.320> trying<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.470> teach<00:01:55.680> these<00:01:55.920> bees<00:01:56.329> to

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
they're trying to teach these bees to

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.929 
they're trying to teach these bees to
have<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.719> hivemind<00:01:58.439> mentality<00:01:59.340> oh<00:01:59.610> that's

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
have a hivemind mentality oh that's

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.130 
have a hivemind mentality oh that's
great<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.390> they're<00:02:00.509> gonna<00:02:00.600> have<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.899> take<00:02:00.960> like

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
great so they're gonna have to take like

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.649 
great so they're gonna have to take like
a<00:02:01.229> quality<00:02:01.710> let's<00:02:02.219> teach<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.670> robot<00:02:02.790> bees<00:02:03.270> to

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
a quality let's teach the robot bees to

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.170 
a quality let's teach the robot bees to
think<00:02:03.899> right<00:02:04.409> when<00:02:04.920> when<00:02:05.520> are<00:02:05.729> they<00:02:05.880> going<00:02:06.030> to

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
think right when when are they going to

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.730 
think right when when are they going to
use<00:02:06.329> these<00:02:06.509> robot<00:02:06.869> bees<00:02:07.079> for<00:02:07.320> drone<00:02:07.500> warfare

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
use these robot bees for drone warfare

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.830 
use these robot bees for drone warfare
that's<00:02:08.700> what<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:08.940> want<00:02:09.149> okay<00:02:09.209> they're<00:02:09.629> not

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
that's what I want okay they're not

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.900 
that's what I want okay they're not
equipped<00:02:10.530> yet<00:02:10.890> with<00:02:11.099> stingers

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
equipped yet with stingers

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.880 
equipped yet with stingers
or<00:02:12.030> many<00:02:12.360> cameras<00:02:12.870> just<00:02:13.170> kind<00:02:13.410> of<00:02:13.440> like<00:02:13.590> get<00:02:13.770> in

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
or many cameras just kind of like get in

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:14.960 
or many cameras just kind of like get in
your<00:02:14.010> face<00:02:14.190> though<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:14.460> think<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:14.850> would<00:02:14.910> be

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
your face though I think that would be

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.850 
your face though I think that would be
enough<00:02:15.120> for<00:02:15.390> me<00:02:15.540> they<00:02:15.840> just<00:02:16.050> all<00:02:16.560> they<00:02:16.710> do<00:02:16.770> is

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
enough for me they just all they do is

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.250 
enough for me they just all they do is
pollinate<00:02:17.490> and<00:02:17.670> it's<00:02:17.760> wonderful<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:18.510> they'd

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
pollinate and it's wonderful and they'd

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.400 
pollinate and it's wonderful and they'd
have<00:02:19.530> none<00:02:20.100> of<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.700> repercussions<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.690> real

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
have none of the repercussions of real

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.760 
have none of the repercussions of real
bees<00:02:22.680> in<00:02:23.010> fact<00:02:23.550> here<00:02:23.940> is<00:02:23.970> safety<00:02:24.720> chef<00:02:25.320> well

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
bees in fact here is safety chef well

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.740 
bees in fact here is safety chef well
let's<00:02:25.980> let's<00:02:26.250> look<00:02:26.520> at<00:02:26.670> this<00:02:26.790> video<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.480> the

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
let's let's look at this video of the

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.600 
let's let's look at this video of the
safety<00:02:27.990> problems<00:02:28.560> with<00:02:28.740> real<00:02:28.980> beans<00:02:29.250> that

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
safety problems with real beans that

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.940 
safety problems with real beans that
these<00:02:29.820> beans<00:02:30.090> will<00:02:30.300> solve<00:02:30.540> okay<00:02:31.110> what<00:02:31.650> what<00:02:31.800> is

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
these beans will solve okay what what is

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.590 
these beans will solve okay what what is
that<00:02:32.100> what<00:02:32.280> is<00:02:32.310> that<00:02:32.400> what<00:02:32.580> is<00:02:32.880> that<00:02:33.030> oh<00:02:35.600> not

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
that what is that what is that oh not

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:47.000 
that what is that what is that oh not
appear<00:02:44.450> see<00:02:45.450> that<00:02:46.020> will<00:02:46.200> never<00:02:46.380> happen<00:02:46.680> with

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
appear see that will never happen with

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.160 
appear see that will never happen with
robot<00:02:47.460> beads<00:02:47.730> unless<00:02:48.210> you<00:02:48.390> pour<00:02:48.630> them<00:02:48.810> into<00:02:48.990> a

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
robot beads unless you pour them into a

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.040 
robot beads unless you pour them into a
little<00:02:49.860> cage<00:02:50.070> over<00:02:50.370> your<00:02:50.520> head<00:02:50.900> but<00:02:51.900> it's

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
little cage over your head but it's

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.020 
little cage over your head but it's
probably<00:02:52.380> okay<00:02:52.950> yeah<00:02:53.340> because<00:02:53.820> they<00:02:53.910> won't

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
probably okay yeah because they won't

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.610 
probably okay yeah because they won't
sting<00:02:54.360> you<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.540> they<00:02:54.960> don't<00:02:55.140> produce<00:02:55.260> honey

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
sting you and they don't produce honey

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.340 
sting you and they don't produce honey
either<00:02:55.860> but<00:02:56.220> they<00:02:56.340> do<00:02:56.400> pollinate<00:02:57.200> so<00:02:58.200> we

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
either but they do pollinate so we

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.960 
either but they do pollinate so we
haven't<00:02:58.530> come<00:02:58.770> up<00:02:58.800> with<00:02:58.920> a<00:02:59.040> plan<00:02:59.460> B<00:02:59.670> for<00:02:59.700> honey

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
haven't come up with a plan B for honey

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.810 
haven't come up with a plan B for honey
yet<00:03:00.180> no<00:03:00.750> we<00:03:00.960> have<00:03:01.140> no<00:03:01.380> Robo<00:03:01.740> honey<00:03:02.010> because

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
yet no we have no Robo honey because

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.430 
yet no we have no Robo honey because
would<00:03:03.270> you<00:03:03.390> would<00:03:03.600> you<00:03:03.630> want<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:03.990> eat<00:03:04.140> honey

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
would you would you want to eat honey

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.440 
would you would you want to eat honey
that<00:03:04.770> was<00:03:04.890> produced<00:03:05.160> by<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:05.460> small<00:03:05.760> well<00:03:06.090> do<00:03:06.360> we

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
that was produced by a small well do we

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.940 
that was produced by a small well do we
want<00:03:06.600> to<00:03:06.630> eat<00:03:06.750> honey<00:03:06.900> now<00:03:07.080> it's<00:03:07.410> produced<00:03:07.830> by

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
want to eat honey now it's produced by

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.290 
want to eat honey now it's produced by
vomiting<00:03:08.160> so<00:03:08.550> I<00:03:08.580> guess<00:03:08.760> that's<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:09.000> good<00:03:09.120> point

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
vomiting so I guess that's a good point

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.110 
vomiting so I guess that's a good point
yeah<00:03:09.860> hmm<00:03:10.860> well<00:03:11.010> it's<00:03:11.190> um<00:03:11.280> honey<00:03:11.430> vomit<00:03:11.730> well<00:03:12.090> I

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
yeah hmm well it's um honey vomit well I

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.660 
yeah hmm well it's um honey vomit well I
don't<00:03:12.240> really<00:03:12.390> know<00:03:12.690> I<00:03:13.110> don't<00:03:14.040> think<00:03:14.370> they're

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
don't really know I don't think they're

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.480 
don't really know I don't think they're
they're<00:03:15.360> equipped<00:03:15.720> with<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.350> right<00:03:16.740> organic

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
they're equipped with the right organic

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.810 
they're equipped with the right organic
stomach<00:03:18.390> things<00:03:19.200> inside<00:03:19.620> bees<00:03:19.920> to<00:03:20.550> create

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
stomach things inside bees to create

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.090 
stomach things inside bees to create
honey<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.390> if<00:03:21.750> they<00:03:21.870> did<00:03:22.110> it<00:03:22.350> probably<00:03:22.890> tastes

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
honey and if they did it probably tastes

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.610 
honey and if they did it probably tastes
like<00:03:23.250> motor<00:03:23.400> oil<00:03:23.550> mmm<00:03:24.390> yeah<00:03:24.540> so<00:03:25.290> you<00:03:25.350> can't

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
like motor oil mmm yeah so you can't

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.260 
like motor oil mmm yeah so you can't
really<00:03:25.680> spread<00:03:26.010> that<00:03:26.070> on<00:03:26.130> your<00:03:26.280> toast<00:03:26.490> yet<00:03:26.730> but

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
really spread that on your toast yet but

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.210 
really spread that on your toast yet but
pollination<00:03:27.690> is<00:03:27.930> a<00:03:27.990> very<00:03:28.320> important<00:03:28.830> function

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
pollination is a very important function

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.240 
pollination is a very important function
of<00:03:29.370> these<00:03:29.940> beads<00:03:30.300> save<00:03:31.050> the<00:03:31.200> plants<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:31.770> not

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
of these beads save the plants and not

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.750 
of these beads save the plants and not
the<00:03:32.490> organic<00:03:33.060> bees<00:03:34.160> I'm<00:03:35.160> gonna<00:03:35.250> miss<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.580> bees

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
the organic bees I'm gonna miss the bees

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.080 
the organic bees I'm gonna miss the bees
I<00:03:36.030> won't<00:03:37.040> be<00:03:38.040> fit<00:03:38.280> my<00:03:38.459> bottom<00:03:38.940> no<00:03:39.420> my<00:03:39.630> bottom
