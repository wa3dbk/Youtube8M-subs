we<00:00:21.760> built<00:00:21.970> a<00:00:22.060> little<00:00:22.150> tiny<00:00:22.450> screen<00:00:22.779> room<00:00:22.990> and

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:23.290 
we built a little tiny screen room and

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.140 
we built a little tiny screen room and
then<00:00:23.410> we<00:00:23.529> put<00:00:23.710> a<00:00:23.740> little<00:00:23.830> tea<00:00:24.610> act<00:00:24.760> mixing

then we put a little tea act mixing
machine<00:00:25.450> in<00:00:25.660> and<00:00:25.930> yes<00:00:26.380> we<00:00:26.590> slowly<00:00:26.920> built<00:00:27.250> up

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
machine in and yes we slowly built up

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.890 
machine in and yes we slowly built up
because<00:00:27.430> we<00:00:27.610> had<00:00:27.760> a<00:00:27.790> place<00:00:28.119> to<00:00:28.270> mix<00:00:28.450> the<00:00:28.600> movies

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
because we had a place to mix the movies

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.330 
because we had a place to mix the movies
we<00:00:29.050> had<00:00:29.200> to<00:00:29.290> have<00:00:29.380> a<00:00:29.410> place<00:00:29.619> to<00:00:29.650> cut<00:00:29.920> the<00:00:30.070> movies

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
we had to have a place to cut the movies

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.569 
we had to have a place to cut the movies
and<00:00:30.520> we<00:00:31.240> had<00:00:31.390> to<00:00:31.509> have<00:00:31.599> so<00:00:32.400> everything<00:00:33.400> I've

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579 
and we had to have so everything I've

and we had to have so everything I've
done<00:00:33.850> I've<00:00:34.180> done<00:00:34.210> literally<00:00:35.200> to<00:00:35.500> be<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:36.730> know

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
done I've done literally to be you know

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.720 
done I've done literally to be you know
in<00:00:37.120> the<00:00:37.329> backwoods<00:00:37.660> by<00:00:37.900> myself<00:00:38.380> to<00:00:38.920> create<00:00:39.250> the

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
in the backwoods by myself to create the

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.290 
in the backwoods by myself to create the
capability<00:00:40.420> of<00:00:40.450> making<00:00:41.079> movies<00:00:41.380> and<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:43.120> was

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
capability of making movies and it was

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.120 
capability of making movies and it was
very<00:00:43.690> hard<00:00:44.050> then<00:00:44.320> as<00:00:44.500> I<00:00:44.620> said<00:00:44.800> you<00:00:44.950> know<00:00:45.010> the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.130 
very hard then as I said you know the

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.010 
very hard then as I said you know the
equipment<00:00:45.430> was<00:00:45.700> very<00:00:45.850> expensive<00:00:46.149> the<00:00:46.630> process

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
equipment was very expensive the process

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.060 
equipment was very expensive the process
was<00:00:47.170> very<00:00:47.230> expensive<00:00:47.650> but<00:00:49.080> and<00:00:50.080> that's<00:00:50.800> why<00:00:51.040> I

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
was very expensive but and that's why I

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.230 
was very expensive but and that's why I
developed<00:00:51.580> a<00:00:51.880> lot<00:00:52.030> of<00:00:52.150> the<00:00:52.210> technology<00:00:53.040> over

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:54.240 
developed a lot of the technology over

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.390 
developed a lot of the technology over
the<00:00:55.240> years<00:00:55.510> was<00:00:56.260> to<00:00:56.440> make<00:00:56.560> that<00:00:56.710> more<00:00:56.860> simply

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
the years was to make that more simply

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.720 
the years was to make that more simply
and<00:00:57.580> much<00:00:58.210> cheaper<00:00:59.220> much<00:01:00.220> more<00:01:00.400> simple

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
and much cheaper much more simple

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.619 
and much cheaper much more simple
process<00:01:01.090> so<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.920> was<00:01:03.360> really<00:01:04.360> how<00:01:04.570> the

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
process so that was really how the

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.469 
process so that was really how the
company<00:01:05.379> got<00:01:05.590> created<00:01:06.450> then<00:01:07.450> and<00:01:07.890> obviously<00:01:09.479> I

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
company got created then and obviously I

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.600 
company got created then and obviously I
was<00:01:10.840> not<00:01:11.080> happy<00:01:11.259> with<00:01:11.470> Hollywood<00:01:11.950> I<00:01:12.189> didn't

know I had to have all my own stuff as a
result<00:01:25.990> of<00:01:26.170> that<00:01:26.380> I<00:01:27.600> said<00:01:28.600> why<00:01:28.810> should<00:01:29.140> we<00:01:29.230> use

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
result of that I said why should we use

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.230 
result of that I said why should we use
this<00:01:29.710> equipment<00:01:30.370> in<00:01:30.430> this<00:01:30.610> stuff<00:01:30.850> when<00:01:31.000> we<00:01:31.090> can

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
this equipment in this stuff when we can

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.649 
this equipment in this stuff when we can
make<00:01:31.420> it<00:01:31.540> better<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:33.610> know<00:01:33.909> because<00:01:33.940> I<00:01:34.390> I've

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
said there's got to be a better way and

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.130 
said there's got to be a better way and
in<00:01:50.799> the<00:01:50.950> process<00:01:51.340> of<00:01:51.490> Star<00:01:51.729> Wars<00:01:52.049> there<00:01:53.049> were

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
in the process of Star Wars there were

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.620 
in the process of Star Wars there were
no<00:01:53.260> visual<00:01:54.130> effects<00:01:54.370> houses<00:01:54.670> so<00:01:55.360> I<00:01:55.420> had<00:01:55.570> to

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
no visual effects houses so I had to

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.990 
no visual effects houses so I had to
invent<00:01:55.900> one<00:01:56.110> and<00:01:56.440> so<00:01:57.100> I<00:01:57.130> did<00:01:57.340> that<00:01:57.549> and<00:01:57.850> then

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
invent one and so I did that and then

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.700 
invent one and so I did that and then
there's<00:01:58.180> a<00:01:58.270> process<00:01:58.720> of<00:01:58.840> that<00:01:58.960> learning<00:01:59.500> about

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
there's a process of that learning about

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.469 
there's a process of that learning about
digital<00:02:00.190> technology<00:02:00.340> and<00:02:00.909> learning<00:02:01.240> about

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
digital technology and learning about

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.750 
digital technology and learning about
you<00:02:02.409> know<00:02:02.440> that<00:02:02.860> sort<00:02:03.100> of<00:02:03.159> thing<00:02:03.340> I<00:02:03.460> said<00:02:03.670> you

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
you know that sort of thing I said you

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.250 
you know that sort of thing I said you
know<00:02:03.850> we<00:02:04.000> could<00:02:04.180> make<00:02:04.210> this<00:02:04.479> better<00:02:04.540> we<00:02:05.170> could

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
know we could make this better we could

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.770 
know we could make this better we could
take<00:02:05.470> the<00:02:05.619> computers<00:02:06.040> and<00:02:06.280> we<00:02:06.340> can<00:02:06.490> make

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
take the computers and we can make

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.139 
take the computers and we can make
editing<00:02:07.780> better<00:02:08.049> we<00:02:08.200> can<00:02:08.319> make

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
editing better we can make

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.070 
editing better we can make
cinematography<00:02:10.149> better<00:02:10.330> we<00:02:10.450> can<00:02:10.539> make<00:02:10.599> visual

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
cinematography better we can make visual

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.300 
cinematography better we can make visual
effects<00:02:11.379> but<00:02:11.560> it<00:02:11.680> really<00:02:11.830> started<00:02:12.189> with

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
effects but it really started with

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.240 
effects but it really started with
visual<00:02:12.640> effects<00:02:12.939> and<00:02:13.180> editing<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:14.010> so<00:02:15.010> it<00:02:15.129> was

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
visual effects and editing and so it was

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.759 
visual effects and editing and so it was
just<00:02:15.340> simply<00:02:15.670> a<00:02:15.730> matter<00:02:15.760> saying<00:02:16.560> there's<00:02:17.560> so

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
just simply a matter saying there's so

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.320 
just simply a matter saying there's so
much<00:02:17.920> stuff<00:02:18.159> you<00:02:18.310> can't<00:02:18.580> do<00:02:18.819> in<00:02:19.000> visual

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330

much stuff you can't do in visual
effects<00:02:20.159> that<00:02:21.159> you<00:02:21.250> want<00:02:21.549> to<00:02:21.700> do<00:02:21.819> because<00:02:22.060> you

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
effects that you want to do because you
