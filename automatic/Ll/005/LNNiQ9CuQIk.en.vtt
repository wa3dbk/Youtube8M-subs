own ginger and you just have a surplus
you<00:00:14.940> don't<00:00:15.120> know<00:00:15.299> what<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.630> do<00:00:15.780> with<00:00:15.929> it<00:00:16.109> and

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
you don't know what to do with it and

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.010 
you don't know what to do with it and
you<00:00:16.920> want<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.250> store<00:00:17.609> it<00:00:17.850> so<00:00:18.449> that's<00:00:18.840> where

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
you want to store it so that's where

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.769 
you want to store it so that's where
this<00:00:19.289> technique<00:00:19.800> would<00:00:20.010> come<00:00:20.250> in<00:00:20.369> handy<00:00:20.789> so

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
this technique would come in handy so

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.320 
this technique would come in handy so
what<00:00:22.260> we're<00:00:22.439> going<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.650> do<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:23.160> this<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.180> the

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
what we're going to do is this is the

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.259 
what we're going to do is this is the
step<00:00:24.720> before<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.470> actually<00:00:25.859> see<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.519> in<00:00:26.970> the

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
step before you actually see it in the

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.740 
step before you actually see it in the
market<00:00:27.750> as<00:00:27.930> dry<00:00:28.619> ginger<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.210> purchase

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
market as dry ginger that you purchase

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.190 
market as dry ginger that you purchase
off<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.080> shelves<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.619> spice<00:00:31.969> you<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.750> fill

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
off the shelves in the spice you it fill

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.459 
off the shelves in the spice you it fill
is<00:00:34.469> it's<00:00:34.890> not<00:00:35.100> ground<00:00:35.880> down<00:00:36.090> but<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.320> is

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
is it's not ground down but it is

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.020 
is it's not ground down but it is
dehydrated<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.399> that's<00:00:38.579> what<00:00:38.730> we're<00:00:38.879> going

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
dehydrated and that's what we're going

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.430 
dehydrated and that's what we're going
to<00:00:39.059> do<00:00:39.180> we're<00:00:39.360> going<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.570> dehydrate<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.290> and

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
to do we're going to dehydrate it and

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.400 
to do we're going to dehydrate it and
that<00:00:41.399> actually<00:00:41.640> gives<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.270> such<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.780> strong

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
that actually gives you such a strong

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.580 
that actually gives you such a strong
flavor<00:00:44.149> way<00:00:45.149> stronger<00:00:45.750> than<00:00:45.899> what<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.200> buy<00:00:46.410> on

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
flavor way stronger than what you buy on

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.610 
flavor way stronger than what you buy on
the<00:00:46.710> shelf<00:00:46.980> as<00:00:47.190> ground<00:00:47.940> ginger<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:48.960> when

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
the shelf as ground ginger so when

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.410 
the shelf as ground ginger so when
you're<00:00:49.860> done<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.309> object<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.270> to

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
you're done the object of this is to

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.150 
you're done the object of this is to
take<00:00:51.629> pieces<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:52.050> ginger<00:00:52.500> as<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.739> need<00:00:52.949> them

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
take pieces of ginger as you need them

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.400 
take pieces of ginger as you need them
and<00:00:53.370> then<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.180> can<00:00:54.210> grind<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.840> at<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.110> time

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
and then you can grind it at that time

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.400 
and then you can grind it at that time
and<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.710> flavor<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.190> just<00:00:56.550> incredible<00:00:57.410> here

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
and the flavor is just incredible here

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.930 
and the flavor is just incredible here
are<00:00:58.590> some<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.920> some<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.550> things<00:00:59.760> you're

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
are some of some of the things you're

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.060 
are some of some of the things you're
going<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.149> need<00:01:00.329> for<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:00.680> obviously<00:01:01.680> you're

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
going to need for this obviously you're

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.179 
going to need for this obviously you're
gonna<00:01:02.160> need<00:01:02.399> changer<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.359> here<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:04.019> just<00:01:04.979> some

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
gonna need changer and here is just some

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.100 
gonna need changer and here is just some
water<00:01:05.549> you're<00:01:05.970> gonna<00:01:06.060> actually<00:01:06.330> soak<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.020> in

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
water you're gonna actually soak it in

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
water you're gonna actually soak it in
this<00:01:07.260> water<00:01:07.500> for<00:01:07.799> two<00:01:08.070> hours<00:01:08.610> you're<00:01:09.360> going<00:01:09.600> to

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
this water for two hours you're going to

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.710 
this water for two hours you're going to
put<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.490> solution<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.330> doesn't<00:01:12.600> turn

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
put it in a solution so it doesn't turn

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.859 
put it in a solution so it doesn't turn
dark<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> three<00:01:15.060> percent<00:01:15.509> lime

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
dark and this is a three percent lime

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.730 
dark and this is a three percent lime
solution<00:01:16.729> so<00:01:17.729> it's<00:01:17.909> line<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.330> water<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:19.560> is

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
solution so it's line of water this is

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.130 
solution so it's line of water this is
simply<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.310> strain<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.820> when<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.509> take<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.080> out

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
simply to strain it when you take it out

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.899 
simply to strain it when you take it out
of<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.409> water<00:01:22.590> after<00:01:22.770> two<00:01:23.070> hours<00:01:23.250> and

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
of the water after two hours and

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.850 
of the water after two hours and
actually<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.720> lime<00:01:24.960> solution<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.530> keep<00:01:25.710> it

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
actually the lime solution you keep it

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.130 
actually the lime solution you keep it
in<00:01:25.950> for<00:01:26.100> six<00:01:26.369> hours<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:27.509> get<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.810> into<00:01:27.930> the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
in for six hours to get it into the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.170 
in for six hours to get it into the
pieces<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.829> want<00:01:29.009> I'm<00:01:29.460> actually<00:01:29.790> going

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
like working with this young ginger

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.170 
like working with this young ginger
because<00:01:56.410> the<00:01:56.950> skin<00:01:57.280> kind<00:01:57.520> of<00:01:57.670> just<00:01:57.850> comes

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
because the skin kind of just comes

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.770 
because the skin kind of just comes
right<00:01:58.510> off<00:01:58.540> under<00:01:59.290> some<00:01:59.650> good<00:01:59.860> water<00:02:00.190> pressure

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
right off under some good water pressure

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.200 
right off under some good water pressure
unlike<00:02:01.780> that<00:02:02.110> ginger<00:02:02.680> that<00:02:03.190> is<00:02:03.610> a<00:02:03.670> little<00:02:04.090> bit

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
unlike that ginger that is a little bit

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.930 
unlike that ginger that is a little bit
more<00:02:04.390> mature<00:02:04.890> where<00:02:05.890> the<00:02:06.130> skin<00:02:06.490> is<00:02:06.520> almost

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
more mature where the skin is almost

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.790 
more mature where the skin is almost
like<00:02:07.150> a<00:02:07.210> husk<00:02:07.630> and<00:02:07.930> you<00:02:08.080> have<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.289> cut<00:02:08.530> it<00:02:08.649> off

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
like a husk and you have to cut it off

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.680 
like a husk and you have to cut it off
it<00:02:09.310> just<00:02:09.429> comes<00:02:09.789> off<00:02:09.970> clean<00:02:10.360> see<00:02:10.929> right<00:02:11.110> there

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
it just comes off clean see right there

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.050 
it just comes off clean see right there
so<00:02:13.690> now<00:02:13.810> I<00:02:13.840> have<00:02:14.200> this<00:02:14.350> clean<00:02:14.770> I'm<00:02:15.700> going<00:02:15.850> to<00:02:15.940> go

as<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:19.630> can<00:02:19.900> my<00:02:20.110> little<00:02:20.230> portable<00:02:20.739> slicer<00:02:21.690> to

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
as I can my little portable slicer to

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.850 
as I can my little portable slicer to
slice<00:02:24.430> it<00:02:24.610> into<00:02:24.820> my<00:02:24.940> water<00:02:25.410> so<00:02:26.410> let's<00:02:26.560> see<00:02:26.739> how
