00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 Ukraine is ready for mutual withdrawal of troops 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.089
 and wide truth is necessary for this 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.880
 fulfill a number of conditions reported at headquarters 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.309
 atoms precisely this locality near 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.769
 Mariupol remains almost the main one. 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.570
 confrontation in the meantime on the outskirts 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.210
 to continue to build Mariupol 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.340
 defense structures we learn all the details from 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.130
 our correspondent lyudmila humpback she 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.689
 in contact with the studio rule how was 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.340
 the day is wide and what is known about 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.340
 withdrawal arrangements 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.399
 good evening she was reported to the headquarters 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.350
 antiterrorist operation the day before 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.270
 in the evening there were two shirokino shelling 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.950
 positions of the Ukrainian military militants 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.200
 opened fire from small arms a 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.969
 after that the conditional was established there 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.710
 silence is conditional because shelling like 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.660
 they were not told to headquarters 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.370
 several times for a very short time 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.960
 the enemy discovered such a self 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.090
 provocative small-arms fire 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.820

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.520
 no those positions 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.890
 Here is the calm still frames called a 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.890
 establishing a final truce 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.950

 the job of sniper them on just like a false you 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.690

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.680
 steep plague us for Galina Jarvis 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.090
 never at anyone he relieve pain in 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.649
 wide today worked again 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.720
 tripartite contact group on 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.090
 coordinating a ceasefire in this 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.100
 the region is Russian and Ukrainian

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.560
 until there is only such a conditional 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.180
 The scheme of the first stage shirokino should 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.790
 set silence on a certain 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.959
 time how much is the number in days possible 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.400

 one hundred millimeters and the final point 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:31.040
 this plan the final task will be 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.510
 establishment of a permanent observant 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.040
