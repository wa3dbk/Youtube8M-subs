leave it out on the counter I know
people<00:00:33.809> are<00:00:34.020> concerned<00:00:34.140> with<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.649> power<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:34.980> a

people are concerned with the power of a
juicers<00:00:35.610> motor<00:00:35.880> but<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.570> depends<00:00:36.989> on<00:00:37.079> how<00:00:37.260> the

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
juicers motor but it depends on how the

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
power is used the Omega puts out very

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.100 
power is used the Omega puts out very
little<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:41.040> its<00:00:41.430> power<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.059> speed<00:00:42.420> but<00:00:42.899> makes

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
little of its power and speed but makes

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.200 
little of its power and speed but makes
up<00:00:43.320> for<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.920> amount<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.219> torque<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:45.059> what

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
up for in the amount of torque and what

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.910 
up for in the amount of torque and what
that<00:00:45.360> means<00:00:45.570> for<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.840> consumer<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.739> it's

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
that means for the consumer that it's

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.799 
that means for the consumer that it's
the<00:00:47.070> most<00:00:47.250> efficient<00:00:47.879> method<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.329> juicing

the machine leave it on the entire time

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.890 
the machine leave it on the entire time
until<00:03:24.160> you've<00:03:24.460> completely<00:03:24.880> finished<00:03:25.420> juicing

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
until you've completely finished juicing

all<00:03:26.050> the<00:03:26.260> fruits<00:03:26.500> and<00:03:26.680> vegetables

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.929 

I<00:03:50.409> just<00:03:51.409> want<00:03:51.560> to<00:03:51.620> show<00:03:51.799> you<00:03:51.859> how<00:03:52.219> small<00:03:52.280> I've

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:52.939 
I just want to show you how small I've

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:55.959 
I just want to show you how small I've
cut<00:03:53.420> the<00:03:53.569> kale<00:03:53.870> apples<00:03:54.829> and<00:03:55.099> carrots<00:03:55.489> and<00:03:55.579> this

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:55.969 
cut the kale apples and carrots and this

00:03:55.969 --> 00:04:22.089 
cut the kale apples and carrots and this
seems<00:03:56.299> to<00:03:56.540> be<00:03:56.659> working<00:03:57.170> fine<00:03:57.379> in<00:03:57.709> the<00:03:57.799> juicer

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.099 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:26.059 

so<00:04:23.099> it<00:04:23.220> took<00:04:23.430> about<00:04:23.550> 20<00:04:24.210> minutes<00:04:24.240> to<00:04:24.800> prep<00:04:25.800> and

00:04:26.059 --> 00:04:26.069 
so it took about 20 minutes to prep and

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:28.670 
so it took about 20 minutes to prep and
juice<00:04:26.840> two<00:04:27.840> apples

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
juice two apples

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.369 
juice two apples
five<00:04:29.009> carrots<00:04:29.610> and<00:04:29.879> one<00:04:30.300> big<00:04:30.599> bunch<00:04:30.900> of<00:04:31.080> kale

00:04:31.369 --> 00:04:31.379 
five carrots and one big bunch of kale

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:35.930 
five carrots and one big bunch of kale
as<00:04:31.650> you<00:04:32.639> can<00:04:32.819> see<00:04:33.060> the<00:04:33.300> pulp<00:04:33.599> is<00:04:33.870> really<00:04:34.560> dry<00:04:34.940> so

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
as you can see the pulp is really dry so

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.710 
as you can see the pulp is really dry so
that<00:04:36.090> means<00:04:36.330> it<00:04:36.509> got<00:04:36.750> most<00:04:37.710> of<00:04:37.979> the<00:04:38.129> juice<00:04:38.340> out

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
that means it got most of the juice out

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.379 
that means it got most of the juice out
so<00:04:39.720> you<00:04:39.810> can<00:04:40.020> see<00:04:40.289> the<00:04:40.500> juice<00:04:40.800> and<00:04:41.280> there's<00:04:42.120> not

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
so you can see the juice and there's not

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.529 
so you can see the juice and there's not
that<00:04:42.449> much<00:04:43.020> foam<00:04:43.379> on<00:04:43.770> top<00:04:43.800> it's<00:04:44.340> a<00:04:44.430> very<00:04:44.669> little

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
that much foam on top it's a very little

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:47.480 
that much foam on top it's a very little
amount<00:04:45.840> of<00:04:46.139> foam<00:04:46.319> it's<00:04:46.620> less<00:04:46.949> than<00:04:47.220> the

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
amount of foam it's less than the

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.080 
amount of foam it's less than the
centrifugal<00:04:48.150> juicers<00:04:49.129> so<00:04:50.129> here<00:04:50.520> is<00:04:50.759> our

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
centrifugal juicers so here is our

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.980 
centrifugal juicers so here is our

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
nutrient rich green juice the omega

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.830 
nutrient rich green juice the omega
j8006<00:04:54.990> is<00:04:55.440> a<00:04:55.500> very<00:04:56.340> efficient<00:04:57.030> juicer<00:04:57.539> it

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
j8006 is a very efficient juicer it

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.839
