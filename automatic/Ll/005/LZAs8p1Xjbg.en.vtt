back<00:02:01.619> where<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:01.890> was<00:02:02.189> as<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:02.939> was<00:02:02.969> saying<00:02:03.360> in<00:02:03.570> the

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
back where I was as I was saying in the

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.010 
back where I was as I was saying in the
third<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.350> fourth<00:02:04.979> piece<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.759> wood<00:02:05.969> I<00:02:06.210> drilled

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
third and fourth piece of wood I drilled

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.490 
third and fourth piece of wood I drilled
two<00:02:07.380> more<00:02:07.649> holes<00:02:08.780> right<00:02:09.780> here<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.289> right<00:02:10.470> here

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
two more holes right here and right here

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.500 
two more holes right here and right here
going<00:02:11.160> into<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.640> second<00:02:12.480> piece

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
going into the second piece

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.740 
going into the second piece
not<00:02:14.200> not<00:02:14.769> at<00:02:14.950> level<00:02:15.280> with<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:15.670> initial<00:02:16.330> rebars

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
not not at level with the initial rebars

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.080 
not not at level with the initial rebars
that<00:02:17.170> were<00:02:17.290> out<00:02:17.470> there<00:02:17.650> but<00:02:17.709> a<00:02:18.250> little<00:02:18.970> more

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
that were out there but a little more

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.080 
that were out there but a little more
inwards<00:02:19.480> and<00:02:19.780> I<00:02:19.900> put<00:02:20.140> shorter<00:02:20.650> rebars<00:02:21.090> 12-inch

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
inwards and I put shorter rebars 12-inch

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.360 
inwards and I put shorter rebars 12-inch
ones<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.599> other<00:02:22.720> ones<00:02:22.840> were<00:02:23.340> two-foot<00:02:24.340> I

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
ones the other ones were two-foot I

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.059 
ones the other ones were two-foot I
believe<00:02:24.730> this<00:02:25.180> is<00:02:25.330> a<00:02:25.360> 12<00:02:25.690> 12<00:02:26.319> inch<00:02:26.500> rebar<00:02:27.040> I

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
believe this is a 12 12 inch rebar I

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.960 
believe this is a 12 12 inch rebar I
believe<00:02:27.400> so<00:02:28.000> there's<00:02:28.180> a<00:02:29.280> there's<00:02:30.280> rebars

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
believe so there's a there's rebars

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.059 
believe so there's a there's rebars
going<00:02:31.239> in<00:02:31.360> like<00:02:31.540> this<00:02:31.569> and<00:02:32.110> then<00:02:32.680> there's<00:02:32.920> the

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
going in like this and then there's the

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.850 
going in like this and then there's the
other<00:02:33.099> longer<00:02:33.730> ones<00:02:33.940> out<00:02:34.180> here<00:02:34.319> so<00:02:35.319> then<00:02:35.530> to

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
other longer ones out here so then to

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.699 
other longer ones out here so then to
finish<00:02:36.040> it<00:02:36.280> off<00:02:36.989> to<00:02:37.989> finish<00:02:38.170> it<00:02:38.379> off<00:02:38.500> like

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
finish it off to finish it off like

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.740 
finish it off to finish it off like
nicely<00:02:38.980> so<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:39.370> rebars<00:02:40.180> aren't<00:02:40.420> sticking

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
nicely so that rebars aren't sticking

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.920 
nicely so that rebars aren't sticking
out<00:02:40.840> of<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.019> top<00:02:41.260> this<00:02:41.920> top<00:02:42.250> cap<00:02:42.549> I<00:02:42.930> only

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
out of the top this top cap I only

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.229 
out of the top this top cap I only
drilled<00:02:44.230> halfway<00:02:44.620> through<00:02:44.920> it<00:02:45.099> so<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:46.090> right

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
drilled halfway through it so to right

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.479 
drilled halfway through it so to right
about<00:02:46.420> here<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:47.290> where<00:02:47.410> it<00:02:47.440> just<00:02:47.530> sits<00:02:48.340> as<00:02:48.459> a

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
about here to where it just sits as a

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.940 
about here to where it just sits as a
cap<00:02:48.819> on<00:02:49.090> top<00:02:49.360> of<00:02:49.569> the<00:02:50.230> rebars<00:02:50.560> that<00:02:50.769> are<00:02:50.860> in

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
cap on top of the rebars that are in

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.490 
cap on top of the rebars that are in
here<00:02:51.160> and<00:02:51.400> then<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.450> final<00:02:52.870> piece<00:02:53.290> of

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
here and then the final piece of

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.479 
here and then the final piece of
material<00:02:53.680> that<00:02:54.250> I<00:02:54.310> used<00:02:54.640> I<00:02:55.019> this<00:02:56.019> took<00:02:56.410> no<00:02:56.680> no

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
material that I used I this took no no

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.949 
material that I used I this took no no
nails<00:02:58.030> or<00:02:58.239> anything<00:02:58.660> or<00:02:59.790> any<00:03:00.790> drilling<00:03:01.569> it<00:03:01.870> was

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
nails or anything or any drilling it was

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.630 
nails or anything or any drilling it was
just<00:03:02.140> all<00:03:02.290> done<00:03:02.470> by<00:03:02.620> hand<00:03:02.650> by<00:03:03.160> drilling<00:03:03.519> into

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
just all done by hand by drilling into

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.130 
just all done by hand by drilling into
the<00:03:03.790> wood<00:03:03.970> that's<00:03:04.180> all<00:03:04.329> that<00:03:04.480> all<00:03:04.720> the

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
the wood that's all that all the

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.650 
the wood that's all that all the
drilling<00:03:05.410> I<00:03:05.560> use<00:03:05.799> but<00:03:06.160> you<00:03:06.640> know<00:03:06.730> what<00:03:06.819> I<00:03:06.879> mean

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
drilling I use but you know what I mean

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.259 
drilling I use but you know what I mean
the<00:03:08.319> final<00:03:08.680> thing<00:03:08.859> that<00:03:09.129> I<00:03:09.160> did<00:03:09.489> to<00:03:09.730> tie<00:03:10.030> all

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
the final thing that I did to tie all

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:15.210 
the final thing that I did to tie all
these<00:03:10.599> pieces<00:03:10.840> together<00:03:11.140> was<00:03:12.040> I<00:03:12.519> bought<00:03:14.220> these

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
these pieces together was I bought these

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.870 
these pieces together was I bought these
things<00:03:16.079> and<00:03:17.079> it<00:03:17.290> just<00:03:17.319> pretty<00:03:17.620> much<00:03:17.799> makes<00:03:18.700> the

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
things and it just pretty much makes the

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.569 
things and it just pretty much makes the
corners<00:03:19.269> a<00:03:19.299> little<00:03:19.599> tighter<00:03:20.079> like<00:03:20.500> you<00:03:21.489> guys

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
corners a little tighter like you guys

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.370 
corners a little tighter like you guys
you<00:03:21.760> can<00:03:21.880> see<00:03:22.090> these<00:03:22.269> bottom<00:03:22.780> ones<00:03:22.810> don't<00:03:23.169> even

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
you can see these bottom ones don't even

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.470 
you can see these bottom ones don't even
move<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:24.340> caps<00:03:24.579> are<00:03:24.760> a<00:03:24.790> little<00:03:24.940> bit<00:03:25.120> Wiggly

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
move the caps are a little bit Wiggly

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.809 
move the caps are a little bit Wiggly
but<00:03:25.630> the<00:03:26.620> tortoises<00:03:27.010> can't<00:03:27.280> even<00:03:27.639> get<00:03:27.790> up

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
but the tortoises can't even get up

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.120 
but the tortoises can't even get up
there<00:03:28.090> and<00:03:28.329> then<00:03:28.750> I<00:03:28.780> have<00:03:28.840> it<00:03:29.019> can't<00:03:29.590> put<00:03:29.829> flip

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
there and then I have it can't put flip

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.559 
there and then I have it can't put flip
them<00:03:30.280> over<00:03:30.519> like<00:03:30.669> even<00:03:31.090> I'm<00:03:31.209> having

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
them over like even I'm having

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.629 
them over like even I'm having
difficulty<00:03:32.109> flipping<00:03:32.500> this<00:03:32.620> over<00:03:32.859> so<00:03:33.609> I

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
difficulty flipping this over so I

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.220 
difficulty flipping this over so I
pretty<00:03:34.120> much<00:03:34.209> just<00:03:34.329> put<00:03:34.690> these<00:03:34.780> in<00:03:34.840> every

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
pretty much just put these in every

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.710 
pretty much just put these in every
corner<00:03:35.620> as<00:03:35.829> you<00:03:35.950> can<00:03:36.099> see<00:03:36.370> there<00:03:36.579> and<00:03:37.419> there

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
corner as you can see there and there

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.809 
corner as you can see there and there
and<00:03:39.419> there<00:03:40.950> every<00:03:41.950> single<00:03:42.099> corner<00:03:42.430> has<00:03:42.639> these

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
and there every single corner has these

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:44.220 
and there every single corner has these
and<00:03:43.060> I<00:03:43.090> just<00:03:43.269> drilled<00:03:43.480> them<00:03:43.599> together<00:03:43.900> and

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
and I just drilled them together and

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.890 
and I just drilled them together and
really<00:03:44.560> just<00:03:44.769> tighten<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.370> corners<00:03:45.730> up<00:03:45.940> so

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
really just tighten the corners up so

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.599 
really just tighten the corners up so
that<00:03:47.530> is<00:03:47.889> how<00:03:48.099> I<00:03:48.900> built<00:03:49.900> my<00:03:50.109> feeding<00:03:50.799> pens<00:03:51.069> and

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
that is how I built my feeding pens and

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.520 
that is how I built my feeding pens and
then<00:03:51.940> as<00:03:52.209> you<00:03:52.329> can<00:03:52.450> see<00:03:52.630> I<00:03:52.660> also<00:03:53.049> did<00:03:53.319> it<00:03:53.349> here

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
then as you can see I also did it here

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.670 
then as you can see I also did it here
on<00:03:53.680> a<00:03:53.709> smaller<00:03:54.130> scale<00:03:54.870> and<00:03:55.870> this<00:03:56.200> is<00:03:56.379> for<00:03:56.560> my

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
on a smaller scale and this is for my

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.879 
on a smaller scale and this is for my
Russian<00:03:56.889> tortoises<00:04:00.150> see<00:04:01.150> right<00:04:01.419> here<00:04:01.889> this

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
Russian tortoises see right here this

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:05.670 
Russian tortoises see right here this
part<00:04:03.609> I<00:04:03.910> just<00:04:04.450> didn't<00:04:04.930> really<00:04:05.109> care<00:04:05.349> about<00:04:05.530> I'm

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
part I just didn't really care about I'm

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.900 
part I just didn't really care about I'm
probably<00:04:05.859> going<00:04:06.069> to<00:04:06.129> solve<00:04:06.400> this<00:04:06.519> part<00:04:06.760> off

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
probably going to solve this part off

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.990 
probably going to solve this part off
but<00:04:07.450> I<00:04:07.480> hit<00:04:07.750> a<00:04:07.959> root<00:04:08.310> down<00:04:09.310> on<00:04:09.459> the<00:04:09.549> ground<00:04:09.760> so

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
but I hit a root down on the ground so

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.369 
but I hit a root down on the ground so
this<00:04:10.150> rebar<00:04:10.480> didn't<00:04:10.720> go<00:04:10.840> all<00:04:10.989> the<00:04:11.019> way<00:04:11.139> through

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:11.379 
this rebar didn't go all the way through

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:13.890 
this rebar didn't go all the way through
but<00:04:11.530> as<00:04:11.650> you<00:04:11.739> can<00:04:11.859> see<00:04:11.919> this<00:04:12.849> doesn't<00:04:13.090> move

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
but as you can see this doesn't move

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.319 
but as you can see this doesn't move
and<00:04:14.080> then<00:04:14.590> I<00:04:14.680> also<00:04:14.860> hit<00:04:15.160> a<00:04:15.370> roof<00:04:15.700> over<00:04:16.060> there

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
and then I also hit a roof over there

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.420 
and then I also hit a roof over there
and<00:04:18.120> this<00:04:19.120> one<00:04:19.299> doesn't<00:04:19.480> move<00:04:19.660> even<00:04:20.010> so<00:04:21.010> I<00:04:21.370> mean

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
and this one doesn't move even so I mean

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.610 
and this one doesn't move even so I mean
