other lip stains out there this rather
than<00:00:39.960> being<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.260> gloss<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.890> more<00:00:41.160> like<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> balm<00:00:41.700> I

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
than being a gloss is more like a balm I

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.670 
than being a gloss is more like a balm I
would<00:00:42.120> say<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.390> gives<00:00:42.570> lips<00:00:42.870> more<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.260> balmy

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
would say it gives lips more of a balmy

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.380 
would say it gives lips more of a balmy
finish<00:00:44.010> but<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.280> doesn't<00:00:44.579> affect<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:45.059> wear

not<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.490> bad<00:01:47.729> thing<00:01:48.030> but<00:01:48.270> if<00:01:48.450> you're<00:01:48.570> looking

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
not a bad thing but if you're looking

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.450 
not a bad thing but if you're looking
for<00:01:49.020> something<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.530> truly<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:50.040> liquid

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
lipstick like I kind of expect a liquid

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.620 
lipstick like I kind of expect a liquid
lip<00:01:52.680> stain<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.220> be<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.759> like<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.149> lot<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.509> those

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
lip stain to be and like a lot of those

out<00:01:54.840> there<00:01:54.869> are<00:01:55.200> including<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.920> new<00:01:56.100> one<00:01:56.340> from

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
out there are including the new one from

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.120 
out there are including the new one from
L'Oreal<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.600> don't<00:01:57.840> always<00:01:58.110> necessarily<00:01:58.409> get

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
L'Oreal you don't always necessarily get

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.609 
L'Oreal you don't always necessarily get
that<00:01:59.340> complete<00:01:59.820> opacity<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:00.869> it's<00:02:01.469> not

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
that complete opacity so it's not

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.230 
that complete opacity so it's not
necessarily<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.280> bad<00:02:02.490> thing<00:02:02.790> but<00:02:03.119> the

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
necessarily a bad thing but the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.969 
necessarily a bad thing but the
inconsistency<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:04.049> guess<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.380> what<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.560> dislike

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
inconsistency I guess is what I dislike

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.070 
inconsistency I guess is what I dislike
most<00:02:05.159> because<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.610> really<00:02:05.850> can

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
most because you really can

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
most because you really can
count<00:02:06.380> on<00:02:06.470> whether<00:02:06.650> you're<00:02:06.830> going<00:02:06.920> to<00:02:07.010> be

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
count on whether you're going to be

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.740 
count on whether you're going to be
getting<00:02:07.370> a<00:02:07.460> sheer<00:02:07.730> wash<00:02:07.910> of<00:02:08.030> color<00:02:08.210> or<00:02:08.509> a<00:02:08.540> nice

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
getting a sheer wash of color or a nice

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.110 
getting a sheer wash of color or a nice
opaque<00:02:09.200> liquid<00:02:09.770> lipstick<00:02:10.550> beyond<00:02:10.910> that

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
opaque liquid lipstick beyond that

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.120 
opaque liquid lipstick beyond that
