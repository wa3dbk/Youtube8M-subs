I call the best of times and the worst

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.130 
I call the best of times and the worst

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
unheard of 30 years ago and at the same

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.319 
unheard of 30 years ago and at the same
time<00:00:36.800> there's<00:00:37.039> been<00:00:37.190> an<00:00:37.309> increasing<00:00:37.670> backlash

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
time there's been an increasing backlash

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.779 
time there's been an increasing backlash
about<00:00:38.930> their<00:00:39.320> success<00:00:39.739> in<00:00:39.980> their<00:00:40.100> presence<00:00:40.550> I

00:00:40.779 --> 00:00:40.789 
about their success in their presence I

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:43.990 
about their success in their presence I
think<00:00:41.660> not<00:00:41.809> too<00:00:42.019> long<00:00:42.230> ago<00:00:42.289> it<00:00:42.920> was<00:00:42.980> very<00:00:43.670> easy

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
think not too long ago it was very easy

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.930 
think not too long ago it was very easy
to<00:00:44.210> equate<00:00:44.809> athleticism<00:00:45.640> strength<00:00:46.640> physical

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
to equate athleticism strength physical

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.259 
to equate athleticism strength physical
power<00:00:47.420> with<00:00:47.989> men<00:00:48.289> and<00:00:48.620> by<00:00:49.309> contrast<00:00:49.879> to<00:00:50.059> think

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:50.269 
power with men and by contrast to think

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:53.529 
power with men and by contrast to think
about<00:00:50.480> women<00:00:50.839> as<00:00:51.050> weak<00:00:51.620> as<00:00:52.039> supportive<00:00:53.000> for

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
about women as weak as supportive for

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:55.750 
about women as weak as supportive for
men<00:00:53.780> purely<00:00:54.589> as<00:00:54.710> sexual<00:00:55.129> objects

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
men purely as sexual objects

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.450 
men purely as sexual objects
now<00:00:56.600> that<00:00:56.929> landscape<00:00:57.410> has<00:00:57.589> changed<00:00:57.620> somewhat

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
now that landscape has changed somewhat

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.220 
now that landscape has changed somewhat
with<00:00:58.670> the<00:00:58.699> with<00:00:59.239> the<00:00:59.359> tremendous<00:00:59.929> growth<00:00:59.960> of

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
with the with the tremendous growth of

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.649 
with the with the tremendous growth of
girls<00:01:00.679> and<00:01:00.829> women's<00:01:01.129> sports<00:01:04.239> everybody<00:01:05.239> has

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
girls and women's sports everybody has

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.070 
girls and women's sports everybody has
the<00:01:05.900> opportunity<00:01:05.930> to<00:01:06.800> see<00:01:07.180> strong<00:01:08.180> powerful

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
the opportunity to see strong powerful

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.340 
the opportunity to see strong powerful
physically<00:01:10.010> competent<00:01:10.810> competitive<00:01:11.810> women

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
physically competent competitive women

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.710 
physically competent competitive women
and<00:01:13.040> I<00:01:13.130> think<00:01:13.370> that<00:01:13.490> really<00:01:13.670> challenges<00:01:14.450> that

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
and I think that really challenges that

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.530 
and I think that really challenges that
simple<00:01:15.620> gender<00:01:16.340> dichotomy<00:01:16.970> that<00:01:17.150> we<00:01:17.210> used<00:01:17.450> to

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
simple gender dichotomy that we used to

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.810 
simple gender dichotomy that we used to
take<00:01:17.750> so<00:01:17.960> much<00:01:18.110> for<00:01:18.320> granted<00:01:18.490> sport<00:01:19.490> is<00:01:19.610> not

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
take so much for granted sport is not

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.240 
take so much for granted sport is not
just<00:01:20.090> a<00:01:20.150> trivial<00:01:20.570> activity<00:01:21.140> for<00:01:21.350> fun<00:01:21.560> it<00:01:22.070> has

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
just a trivial activity for fun it has

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.280 
just a trivial activity for fun it has
real<00:01:22.550> deep<00:01:22.910> cultural<00:01:23.390> meaning<00:01:23.720> in<00:01:23.840> this

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
real deep cultural meaning in this

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.180 
real deep cultural meaning in this
society<00:01:24.710> and<00:01:25.250> I<00:01:25.700> think<00:01:25.940> that<00:01:26.150> to<00:01:26.680> to<00:01:27.680> challenge

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
society and I think that to to challenge

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.860 
society and I think that to to challenge
that<00:01:28.310> meeting<00:01:28.700> that<00:01:29.000> meaning<00:01:29.390> in<00:01:29.480> terms<00:01:29.690> of

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
that meeting that meaning in terms of

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.180 
that meeting that meaning in terms of
what<00:01:30.050> it<00:01:30.200> means<00:01:30.410> to<00:01:30.590> be<00:01:30.680> a<00:01:30.710> man<00:01:30.950> in<00:01:31.100> this

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
what it means to be a man in this

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.580 
what it means to be a man in this
culture<00:01:31.550> by<00:01:31.820> inviting<00:01:32.810> women<00:01:33.110> in<00:01:33.380> and

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
culture by inviting women in and

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.980 
culture by inviting women in and
acknowledging<00:01:34.250> that<00:01:34.280> women<00:01:34.670> are<00:01:34.760> also

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990

athletic and muscular and strong is a
real<00:01:38.870> challenge<00:01:39.140> to<00:01:39.470> that<00:01:39.560> cultural<00:01:40.070> norm

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
real challenge to that cultural norm

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.390 
real challenge to that cultural norm
that<00:01:40.790> we<00:01:40.820> live<00:01:41.090> in<00:01:41.240> over<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.320> course<00:01:43.100> of<00:01:43.280> a

that we see in the media and I think

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.470

particularly if you look at sports media

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.960 
particularly if you look at sports media
by<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.590> large<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:47.099> decisions<00:02:47.549> about<00:02:47.819> what

portrayed<00:02:56.280> in<00:02:56.519> a<00:02:56.670> more<00:02:56.880> feminine<00:02:57.090> way<00:02:57.450> it's

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.080 

I<00:03:00.620> think<00:03:00.950> it's<00:03:01.069> pretty<00:03:01.250> clear<00:03:01.550> that<00:03:01.610> if<00:03:01.940> you're

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
I think it's pretty clear that if you're

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.059 
I think it's pretty clear that if you're
a<00:03:02.120> female<00:03:02.330> athlete<00:03:02.900> and<00:03:03.080> you<00:03:03.170> want<00:03:03.440> corporate

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
a female athlete and you want corporate

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:05.830 
a female athlete and you want corporate
sponsorship<00:03:04.730> you'd<00:03:04.940> better<00:03:05.180> project<00:03:05.660> a

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
sponsorship you'd better project a

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.500 
sponsorship you'd better project a
wholesome<00:03:06.440> image<00:03:06.770> and<00:03:07.340> part<00:03:08.180> of<00:03:08.300> that

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
wholesome image and part of that

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.370 
wholesome image and part of that
wholesomeness<00:03:09.170> is<00:03:09.620> the<00:03:10.120> assumption<00:03:11.120> that<00:03:11.390> you

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
wholesomeness is the assumption that you

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.960 
wholesomeness is the assumption that you
are<00:03:12.410> not<00:03:12.860> lesbian<00:03:13.489> that<00:03:13.640> you<00:03:13.790> are

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
are not lesbian that you are

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.410 
are not lesbian that you are
heterosexual<00:03:16.000> so<00:03:17.000> you'll<00:03:17.180> have<00:03:17.390> a

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
heterosexual so you'll have a

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.330 
heterosexual so you'll have a
disproportionate<00:03:18.349> number<00:03:18.620> of<00:03:18.650> images<00:03:19.190> of
