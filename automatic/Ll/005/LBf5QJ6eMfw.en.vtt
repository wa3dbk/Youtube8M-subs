three renegade 800 s all three of them

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.640 
three renegade 800 s all three of them
are<00:00:29.859> running<00:00:30.160> and<00:00:30.880> exhaust<00:00:31.359> this<00:00:32.050> is<00:00:32.199> also<00:00:32.410> an

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650 
are running and exhaust this is also an

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.160 
are running and exhaust this is also an
eight<00:00:32.830> exhaust<00:00:33.250> which<00:00:34.059> had<00:00:34.239> great<00:00:34.570> results

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
eight exhaust which had great results

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.590 
eight exhaust which had great results
from<00:00:35.650> the<00:00:35.800> ant<00:00:35.949> exhaust<00:00:36.309> on<00:00:36.550> the<00:00:36.640> renegade<00:00:36.970> 800

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
from the ant exhaust on the renegade 800

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.939 
from the ant exhaust on the renegade 800
excellent<00:00:38.530> power<00:00:38.739> output<00:00:40.379> for<00:00:41.379> power<00:00:41.589> games

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:41.949 
excellent power output for power games

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:45.570 
excellent power output for power games
right<00:00:42.540> there<00:00:43.540> ceramic<00:00:44.110> coated<00:00:44.500> so<00:00:45.339> it

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
right there ceramic coated so it

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.640 
right there ceramic coated so it
actually<00:00:45.790> helps<00:00:46.449> you<00:00:46.629> with<00:00:46.900> heat<00:00:47.110> dissipation

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
actually helps you with heat dissipation

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.219 
actually helps you with heat dissipation
which<00:00:48.159> actually<00:00:48.430> gives<00:00:48.670> you<00:00:48.970> horsepower<00:00:49.449> so

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:50.229 
which actually gives you horsepower so

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:52.140 
which actually gives you horsepower so
you<00:00:50.830> get<00:00:50.949> to<00:00:51.040> see<00:00:51.190> the<00:00:51.309> first<00:00:51.519> time<00:00:51.729> just<00:00:51.760> like

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
you get to see the first time just like

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.049 
you get to see the first time just like
I<00:00:52.330> do<00:00:52.390> so<00:00:53.260> it<00:00:53.409> looks<00:00:53.440> like<00:00:53.710> is<00:00:54.339> you<00:00:54.580> know<00:00:54.729> under

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
I do so it looks like is you know under

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.869 
I do so it looks like is you know under
the<00:00:55.150> new<00:00:55.299> renegade<00:00:55.690> 1000<00:00:56.470> if<00:00:57.339> you've<00:00:57.580> seen<00:00:57.760> the

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
the new renegade 1000 if you've seen the

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:59.579 
the new renegade 1000 if you've seen the
pictures<00:00:58.299> of<00:00:58.479> it<00:00:58.629> the<00:00:58.839> exhaust<00:00:59.199> comes

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589 
pictures of it the exhaust comes

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:01.710 
pictures of it the exhaust comes
sideways<00:01:00.339> across<00:01:00.549> the<00:01:00.970> back<00:01:01.180> where<00:01:01.570> there

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
sideways across the back where there

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.200 
sideways across the back where there
used<00:01:01.750> to<00:01:02.080> be<00:01:02.140> a<00:01:02.530> storage<00:01:02.979> compartment<00:01:03.210> so

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
used to be a storage compartment so

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.850 
used to be a storage compartment so
they've<00:01:04.390> removed<00:01:04.720> the<00:01:04.900> storage<00:01:05.229> compartment

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
they've removed the storage compartment

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.590 
they've removed the storage compartment
and<00:01:06.010> now<00:01:06.280> the<00:01:06.340> exhaust<00:01:06.820> comes<00:01:07.090> across<00:01:07.330> the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
and now the exhaust comes across the

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.580 
and now the exhaust comes across the
back<00:01:08.159> I'm<00:01:09.159> sure<00:01:09.340> why<00:01:09.549> they<00:01:09.700> did<00:01:09.850> that<00:01:09.880> but

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
back I'm sure why they did that but

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.250 
back I'm sure why they did that but
anyway<00:01:11.590> we're<00:01:12.100> hoping<00:01:12.280> this<00:01:12.730> a.m<00:01:13.480> has<00:01:16.260> changed

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
anyway we're hoping this a.m has changed

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.310 
anyway we're hoping this a.m has changed
that<00:01:17.470> so<00:01:17.650> it's<00:01:17.770> coming<00:01:18.010> Fred<00:01:18.220> up<00:01:18.340> back<00:01:18.550> again

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
that so it's coming Fred up back again

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.600 
that so it's coming Fred up back again
it<00:01:20.320> does<00:01:20.530> look<00:01:20.560> like<00:01:20.890> this<00:01:21.070> is<00:01:21.220> a<00:01:21.310> straight

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
it does look like this is a straight

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.260 
it does look like this is a straight
exhaust<00:01:21.760> it's<00:01:22.510> going<00:01:22.720> to<00:01:22.780> be<00:01:22.900> a<00:01:22.930> slip-on<00:01:24.270> so

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
exhaust it's going to be a slip-on so

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:32.450 
exhaust it's going to be a slip-on so
let's<00:01:25.600> see<00:01:25.840> what<00:01:26.110> see<00:01:26.680> what<00:01:26.830> you<00:01:26.950> look

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.030 

you

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:50.230 

can<00:01:38.670> look<00:01:38.880> phone<00:01:39.210> call<00:01:39.480> or<00:01:39.660> come<00:01:39.930> back

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:02:02.580 

it<00:01:51.240> definitely<00:01:51.690> is<00:01:51.840> straight

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.730 

the<00:02:03.590> finish<00:02:03.950> looks<00:02:04.330> typical<00:02:05.330> 4am<00:02:05.810> by<00:02:06.200> ceramic

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
the finish looks typical 4am by ceramic

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.290 
the finish looks typical 4am by ceramic
coating<00:02:09.520> so<00:02:10.520> it's<00:02:10.640> going<00:02:10.729> to<00:02:10.820> come<00:02:10.910> thread<00:02:11.180> on

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
coating so it's going to come thread on

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.540 
coating so it's going to come thread on
the<00:02:11.420> back<00:02:11.600> this<00:02:12.050> has<00:02:12.230> got<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.740> drop<00:02:13.010> down<00:02:13.220> tip

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
the back this has got the drop down tip

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.880 
the back this has got the drop down tip
on<00:02:13.760> it<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:14.300> exhaust<00:02:14.630> that<00:02:15.020> we<00:02:15.140> have<00:02:15.380> on<00:02:15.650> all

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
on it the exhaust that we have on all

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.760 
on it the exhaust that we have on all
three<00:02:16.160> of<00:02:16.190> these<00:02:16.520> renegades<00:02:17.060> it's<00:02:17.450> got<00:02:17.600> a

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
three of these renegades it's got a

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.850 
three of these renegades it's got a
billet<00:02:19.360> aluminum<00:02:20.360> it's<00:02:21.350> got<00:02:21.470> a<00:02:21.500> billet

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
billet aluminum it's got a billet

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.750 
billet aluminum it's got a billet
aluminum<00:02:22.310> come<00:02:22.790> check<00:02:23.060> tip<00:02:23.560> so<00:02:24.560> I'm<00:02:25.430> imagining

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
aluminum come check tip so I'm imagining

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.610 
aluminum come check tip so I'm imagining
they're<00:02:26.150> probably<00:02:26.390> going<00:02:26.690> to<00:02:26.810> have<00:02:26.959> that<00:02:27.260> for

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
they're probably going to have that for

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.620 
they're probably going to have that for
this<00:02:27.770> one<00:02:28.040> looks<00:02:28.280> like<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.580> same<00:02:28.760> size<00:02:29.090> is<00:02:29.480> the

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
this one looks like the same size is the

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.010 
this one looks like the same size is the
one<00:02:29.780> for<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:29.990> ring<00:02:30.170> at<00:02:30.320> 1800<00:02:31.690> over<00:02:32.690> all<00:02:32.870> the

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
one for the ring at 1800 over all the

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.920 
one for the ring at 1800 over all the
finishes<00:02:34.060> impact<00:02:35.060> for<00:02:35.300> just<00:02:35.540> like<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:35.840> always

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
finishes impact for just like it always

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.830 
finishes impact for just like it always
has<00:02:36.410> been<00:02:36.709> from<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:37.790> system's<00:02:38.330> we've<00:02:38.510> gotten

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
has been from the system's we've gotten

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.570 
has been from the system's we've gotten
from<00:02:38.870> in<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.290> past<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:41.060> welding<00:02:41.480> looks<00:02:41.900> great

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
from in the past the welding looks great

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.180 
from in the past the welding looks great
I'm<00:02:43.580> sure<00:02:43.820> it's<00:02:43.970> going<00:02:44.060> to<00:02:44.150> sound<00:02:44.300> awesome<00:02:45.190> so

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
I'm sure it's going to sound awesome so

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.390 
I'm sure it's going to sound awesome so
anyway<00:02:46.959> that's<00:02:47.959> it<00:02:48.260> just<00:02:49.070> going<00:02:49.220> to<00:02:49.280> come

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
anyway that's it just going to come

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.910 
anyway that's it just going to come
straight<00:02:49.520> out<00:02:49.700> back<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.420> eliminate<00:02:51.380> the
