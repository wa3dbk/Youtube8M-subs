00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
together you know you have to have that

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.479 
together you know you have to have that
infrastructure<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:40.440> good<00:00:40.860> people<00:00:41.309> working

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
infrastructure of good people working

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.729 
infrastructure of good people working
with<00:00:41.879> other<00:00:42.059> good<00:00:42.300> people<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.840> create<00:00:43.050> synergy

so<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.309> lead<00:00:44.850> off<00:00:44.969> with<00:00:45.120> politoed<00:00:45.690> he<00:00:46.170> has

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
so I lead off with politoed he has

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.580 
so I lead off with politoed he has
deoxys<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.520> clearly<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.690> battle<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.410> was

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
deoxys this is clearly a battle that was

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.619 
deoxys this is clearly a battle that was
taken<00:00:49.980> place<00:00:50.160> before<00:00:50.460> day<00:00:50.820> ox's<00:00:51.149> speed<00:00:51.420> was

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
taken place before day ox's speed was

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.590 
taken place before day ox's speed was
banned<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.800> that's<00:00:53.129> why<00:00:53.309> he<00:00:53.520> has<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.149> I'm

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
banned so that's why he has it so I'm

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.479 
banned so that's why he has it so I'm
gonna<00:00:54.780> go<00:00:54.960> for<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.289> ice<00:00:55.469> beam<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.980> start<00:00:56.250> with

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
gonna go for the ice beam to start with

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.430 
gonna go for the ice beam to start with
I<00:00:56.699> know<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:57.180> he<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.360> most<00:00:57.629> likely<00:00:57.930> having<00:00:58.289> a

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
I know that he is most likely having a

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.529 
I know that he is most likely having a
focus<00:00:58.680> sash<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.309> therefore<00:00:59.879> I<00:00:59.910> would<00:01:00.059> prefer

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
focus sash and therefore I would prefer

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.049 
focus sash and therefore I would prefer
it<00:01:01.170> if<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.559> were<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.920> break<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.370> focus<00:01:02.730> ash<00:01:02.850> with

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
it if I were to break the focus ash with

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.240 
it if I were to break the focus ash with
ice<00:01:03.210> beam<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.660> then<00:01:04.080> follow<00:01:04.409> up<00:01:04.650> with<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.860> hydro

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
ice beam and then follow up with a hydro

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.920 
ice beam and then follow up with a hydro
pump<00:01:05.400> kill<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.939> don't<00:01:06.330> want<00:01:06.510> hydro<00:01:06.780> pump

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
pump kill I don't want hydro pump

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.050 
pump kill I don't want hydro pump

missing first turn as it usually doesn't

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.149 
missing first turn as it usually doesn't
squeeze<00:01:09.240> my<00:01:09.360> life<00:01:09.540> but<00:01:09.750> I'm<00:01:10.409> pretty<00:01:10.619> sure<00:01:10.740> that

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
squeeze my life but I'm pretty sure that

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.620 
squeeze my life but I'm pretty sure that

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
he's just a dual screen or a stealth

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.510 
he's just a dual screen or a stealth
rocker<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.170> he<00:01:13.229> says<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.890> stealth<00:01:14.100> rock<00:01:14.280> so

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
rocker and he says of stealth rock so

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.010 
rocker and he says of stealth rock so

with<00:01:18.210> from<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.110> off<00:01:19.259> with<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.530> politoed<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.189> he

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
with from the off with a politoed so he

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.590 
with from the off with a politoed so he
goes<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.610> matter<00:01:20.790> gross<00:01:21.000> hoping<00:01:21.360> he<00:01:21.479> can

take<00:01:21.810> an<00:01:22.170> ice<00:01:22.350> beam<00:01:22.590> I'm<00:01:22.770> guessin<00:01:23.189> thinking

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
take an ice beam I'm guessin thinking

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.789

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
that I'm probably no scarf door specs or

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.560 
that I'm probably no scarf door specs or
something<00:01:26.100> locked<00:01:26.430> into<00:01:26.640> ice<00:01:26.729> beam<00:01:26.970> but<00:01:27.180> no<00:01:27.360> I

go for hydro pump on the switch as he

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:30.920 
go for hydro pump on the switch as he
switches<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.060> in<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.329> takes<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.570> hell<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.869> lot

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
switches it in it takes a hell of a lot

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.539 
switches it in it takes a hell of a lot
of<00:01:31.049> damage<00:01:31.229> tries<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.920> dent<00:01:32.159> me<00:01:32.310> with<00:01:32.460> an

of damage tries to dent me with an
earthquake<00:01:33.030> I'm<00:01:33.600> not<00:01:33.810> really<00:01:33.960> sure<00:01:34.079> what<00:01:34.409> kind

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
earthquake I'm not really sure what kind

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.660 
earthquake I'm not really sure what kind
of<00:01:34.590> meta<00:01:34.740> grows<00:01:34.920> this<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.250> because<00:01:35.549> it

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
of meta grows this is because it

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.550 
of meta grows this is because it
definitely<00:01:35.820> wasn't<00:01:36.210> defensive<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.079> it

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
definitely wasn't defensive and it

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.770 
definitely wasn't defensive and it
definitely<00:01:37.770> wasn't<00:01:38.340> offensive<00:01:39.210> because<00:01:39.630> I

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
definitely wasn't offensive because I

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.480 
definitely wasn't offensive because I
mean<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.020> didn't<00:01:40.740> take<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.040> hydro<00:01:41.310> pump

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
mean it didn't take the hydro pump

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.490 
mean it didn't take the hydro pump
favorably<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.899> earthquake<00:01:43.229> didn't

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
favorably and the earthquake didn't

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.139 
favorably and the earthquake didn't
really<00:01:43.649> do<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:43.799> much<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.369> don't<00:01:44.909> really<00:01:45.060> know

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
really do that much so don't really know

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.850

going<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:07.950> do<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:08.190> I'm<00:02:08.280> going<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.459> into<00:02:08.700> mesprit

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
going to do is I'm going to into mesprit

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.089 
going to do is I'm going to into mesprit
now<00:02:09.479> knowing<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:09.989> he's<00:02:10.080> he<00:02:10.500> has<00:02:10.590> super<00:02:10.920> power
