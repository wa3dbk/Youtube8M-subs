00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
through this is way easier okay so we're

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.680 
through this is way easier okay so we're
going<00:02:50.110> to<00:02:50.200> go<00:02:50.230> composition<00:02:51.220> new<00:02:52.000> composition

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
going to go composition new composition

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.539 
going to go composition new composition
and<00:02:53.349> once<00:02:54.310> again<00:02:54.519> I<00:02:55.079> am<00:02:56.079> kind<00:02:57.010> of<00:02:57.040> a<00:02:57.220> little<00:02:57.459> bit

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.020 
4k and the 1080p preset for anamorphic
widescreen<00:03:07.769> so<00:03:08.769> since<00:03:09.370> we're<00:03:09.519> still<00:03:09.730> doing<00:03:09.819> in

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
widescreen so since we're still doing in

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.819 
widescreen so since we're still doing in
high<00:03:10.209> definition<00:03:10.420> i'm<00:03:11.019> going<00:03:11.170> to<00:03:11.230> go<00:03:11.530> to<00:03:11.590> this

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
high definition i'm going to go to this

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.930 
high definition i'm going to go to this
and<00:03:12.099> as<00:03:12.849> you<00:03:13.060> can<00:03:13.239> see<00:03:13.269> it<00:03:14.459> shows<00:03:15.459> up<00:03:15.670> with<00:03:15.819> the

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
and as you can see it shows up with the

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.670 
and as you can see it shows up with the
same<00:03:16.090> dimensions<00:03:16.739> 1920<00:03:17.739> x<00:03:18.269> 817<00:03:19.269> square<00:03:20.230> pixels

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
same dimensions 1920 x 817 square pixels

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.470 
same dimensions 1920 x 817 square pixels
so<00:03:21.370> make<00:03:21.849> sure<00:03:21.880> your<00:03:22.150> framerate<00:03:22.359> is<00:03:22.630> 24<00:03:23.139> or

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
so make sure your framerate is 24 or

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.089 
so make sure your framerate is 24 or
23.976<00:03:25.620> either<00:03:26.620> one<00:03:26.799> is<00:03:26.980> fine<00:03:27.010> and<00:03:28.950> i'm<00:03:29.950> going

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
23.976 either one is fine and i'm going

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:31.500 
23.976 either one is fine and i'm going
to<00:03:30.160> change<00:03:30.310> just<00:03:30.609> a<00:03:30.700> quarter<00:03:31.060> because<00:03:31.329> my

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
to change just a quarter because my

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.580 
to change just a quarter because my
computer<00:03:31.690> kind<00:03:32.109> of<00:03:32.169> freaks<00:03:32.380> out<00:03:32.530> sometimes

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
computer kind of freaks out sometimes

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.620 
computer kind of freaks out sometimes
and<00:03:33.250> set<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.180> duration<00:03:34.480> of<00:03:34.840> your<00:03:36.630> composition

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
and set the duration of your composition

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.330 
and set the duration of your composition
go<00:03:38.109> ahead<00:03:38.230> and<00:03:38.319> hit<00:03:38.380> OK<00:03:38.680> and<00:03:38.819> as<00:03:39.819> you<00:03:40.000> can<00:03:40.150> see

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
go ahead and hit OK and as you can see

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.190 
go ahead and hit OK and as you can see
voila<00:03:42.340> we<00:03:43.209> have<00:03:43.389> an<00:03:43.690> anamorphic<00:03:44.319> looking<00:03:44.950> box

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
voila we have an anamorphic looking box

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.809 
voila we have an anamorphic looking box
now<00:03:47.250> what<00:03:48.250> we're<00:03:48.370> going<00:03:48.459> to<00:03:48.549> do<00:03:48.700> is<00:03:49.359> import<00:03:50.019> a
