so<00:01:10.520> let's<00:01:10.670> do<00:01:10.850> this<00:01:11.119> laptop<00:01:11.840> one<00:01:12.229> is<00:01:12.470> the

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
so let's do this laptop one is the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.940 
so let's do this laptop one is the
Lenovo<00:01:13.460> y50<00:01:13.990> let's<00:01:14.990> get<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:15.290> specs<00:01:15.590> out<00:01:15.830> of

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
Lenovo y50 let's get the specs out of

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.790 
Lenovo y50 let's get the specs out of
the<00:01:16.040> way<00:01:16.220> it<00:01:16.610> has<00:01:16.940> a<00:01:16.970> Haswell<00:01:17.780> quad-core<00:01:18.500> i7

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
the way it has a Haswell quad-core i7

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.620 
the way it has a Haswell quad-core i7
CPU<00:01:19.759> nvidia<00:01:20.570> geforce<00:01:20.869> gtx<00:01:21.680> 860m<00:01:22.479> with<00:01:23.479> two

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
CPU nvidia geforce gtx 860m with two

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.740 
CPU nvidia geforce gtx 860m with two
gigabytes<00:01:23.750> of<00:01:24.259> video<00:01:24.560> memory<00:01:24.740> a<00:01:25.570> 15.6<00:01:26.570> inch

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
gigabytes of video memory a 15.6 inch

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.040 
gigabytes of video memory a 15.6 inch
LED<00:01:27.110> display<00:01:27.860> with<00:01:28.399> a<00:01:28.550> resolution<00:01:28.580> of<00:01:29.300> 1920<00:01:30.020> by

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
LED display with a resolution of 1920 by

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.520 
LED display with a resolution of 1920 by
1080<00:01:30.649> so<00:01:31.160> it's<00:01:31.340> full<00:01:31.550> HD<00:01:31.580> it<00:01:32.509> also<00:01:32.810> has<00:01:32.990> 8<00:01:33.320> 2

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
1080 so it's full HD it also has 8 2

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.940 
1080 so it's full HD it also has 8 2
gigabytes<00:01:33.920> of<00:01:34.039> RAM<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:34.700> a<00:01:35.060> 500<00:01:35.810> gigabyte<00:01:35.990> HDD

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
gigabytes of RAM and a 500 gigabyte HDD

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.969 
gigabytes of RAM and a 500 gigabyte HDD
with<00:01:37.220> an<00:01:37.729> 8<00:01:38.000> gigabyte<00:01:38.479> SSD<00:01:38.960> so<00:01:39.619> it<00:01:39.710> kind<00:01:39.890> of

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
with an 8 gigabyte SSD so it kind of

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.790 
with an 8 gigabyte SSD so it kind of
acts<00:01:40.100> as<00:01:40.369> a<00:01:40.430> fusion<00:01:41.060> drive<00:01:41.210> and<00:01:41.660> this<00:01:42.170> is<00:01:42.470> just

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
acts as a fusion drive and this is just

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.670 
acts as a fusion drive and this is just
the<00:01:42.920> base<00:01:43.160> model<00:01:43.670> of<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:44.060> Y<00:01:44.180> 54<00:01:45.170> just<00:01:45.350> a<00:01:45.410> little

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
the base model of the Y 54 just a little

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.740 
the base model of the Y 54 just a little
bit<00:01:45.770> extra<00:01:46.069> you<00:01:46.340> can<00:01:46.459> move<00:01:46.670> up<00:01:46.850> and<00:01:47.000> get<00:01:47.209> 16

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
bit extra you can move up and get 16

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.380 
bit extra you can move up and get 16
gigabytes<00:01:48.140> of<00:01:48.259> RAM<00:01:48.530> added<00:01:49.280> storage<00:01:49.759> and<00:01:49.970> so<00:01:50.209> on

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
gigabytes of RAM added storage and so on

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.389 
gigabytes of RAM added storage and so on
so<00:01:50.899> definitely<00:01:51.350> look<00:01:51.649> into<00:01:51.800> that<00:01:52.130> if<00:01:52.280> you're

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399

resolution of 3200 by 1800 and this is

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.610 
resolution of 3200 by 1800 and this is
one<00:02:47.060> of<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.209> main<00:02:47.420> selling<00:02:47.720> points<00:02:48.200> of<00:02:48.290> this

one of the main selling points of this

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.220 
one of the main selling points of this
device<00:02:48.980> it<00:02:49.550> also<00:02:49.670> has<00:02:50.000> 8<00:02:50.269> gigabytes<00:02:50.599> of<00:02:50.959> RAM

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
device it also has 8 gigabytes of RAM

and a 256 gigabyte solid state drive

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.760 
and a 256 gigabyte solid state drive
so<00:02:55.340> this<00:02:55.520> laptop<00:02:56.030> does<00:02:56.330> cost<00:02:56.660> about<00:02:57.110> twice<00:02:57.530> as

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
so this laptop does cost about twice as

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.580 
so this laptop does cost about twice as
much<00:02:58.010> as<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.640> y50<00:02:59.300> but<00:02:59.690> like<00:02:59.810> I<00:02:59.930> said<00:03:00.200> it<00:03:00.380> does

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
much as the y50 but like I said it does

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.820 
much as the y50 but like I said it does
have<00:03:00.830> an<00:03:01.010> amazing<00:03:01.520> 3200<00:03:02.390> by<00:03:02.540> 1800<00:03:02.930> display<00:03:03.530> and

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
it uses a high capacity SSD instead of

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.780 
it uses a high capacity SSD instead of

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
an HDD SSD combo and above all else this

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.270 
an HDD SSD combo and above all else this
machine<00:03:11.240> has<00:03:11.510> an<00:03:11.660> amazing<00:03:12.320> build<00:03:12.560> quality<00:03:12.890> and

is shockingly thin for a gaming notebook
the<00:03:16.190> design<00:03:16.640> is<00:03:16.880> actually<00:03:17.390> extremely<00:03:17.690> close

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
the design is actually extremely close

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.050 
the design is actually extremely close

display<00:03:20.660> and<00:03:20.960> that's<00:03:21.320> mostly<00:03:21.680> because<00:03:21.770> it

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
display and that's mostly because it

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.000 
display and that's mostly because it
does<00:03:22.790> implement<00:03:23.210> the<00:03:23.720> same<00:03:24.080> full<00:03:24.470> aluminum

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010

does implement the same full aluminum
unibody<00:03:25.310> design<00:03:25.670> and<00:03:26.270> I<00:03:26.570> did<00:03:26.780> say<00:03:26.990> that<00:03:27.020> this

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
unibody design and I did say that this

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.410 
unibody design and I did say that this
laptop<00:03:27.560> is<00:03:28.010> extremely<00:03:28.610> thin<00:03:28.880> and<00:03:29.060> it<00:03:29.390> is

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
don't choose the base model which is why

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.750 
don't choose the base model which is why
I<00:03:41.270> do<00:03:41.390> recommend<00:03:41.840> you<00:03:42.500> should<00:03:42.560> move<00:03:42.860> up<00:03:43.070> to<00:03:43.250> 16

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
I do recommend you should move up to 16

I do recommend you should move up to 16
gigabytes<00:03:43.790> of<00:03:44.270> RAM<00:03:44.540> if<00:03:44.780> you<00:03:45.020> can

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
gigabytes of RAM if you can

gigabytes of RAM if you can
the<00:03:45.950> only<00:03:46.130> flaws<00:03:46.520> I<00:03:46.730> could<00:03:46.880> find<00:03:47.150> is<00:03:47.480> that<00:03:47.510> the

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
the only flaws I could find is that the

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.170 
the only flaws I could find is that the
battery<00:03:48.050> life<00:03:48.380> isn't<00:03:48.680> the<00:03:48.950> best<00:03:49.220> on<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:49.580> y50

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
battery life isn't the best on the y50

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.240 
battery life isn't the best on the y50
but<00:03:50.720> when<00:03:50.900> you<00:03:51.020> game<00:03:51.260> you<00:03:51.590> should<00:03:51.860> have<00:03:52.070> the

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
but when you game you should have the

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.000 
but when you game you should have the
laptop<00:03:52.730> plugged<00:03:53.030> in<00:03:53.240> anyways<00:03:53.720> and<00:03:54.020> lastly<00:03:54.710> the

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
laptop plugged in anyways and lastly the

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.130 
laptop plugged in anyways and lastly the

display isn't as true to life as it

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.630 
display isn't as true to life as it
could<00:03:57.380> be<00:03:57.530> when<00:03:57.860> it<00:03:57.950> comes<00:03:58.130> to<00:03:58.280> the<00:03:58.400> color

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
could be when it comes to the color

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.580 
could be when it comes to the color
representation<00:03:59.270> on<00:03:59.810> the<00:04:00.020> panel<00:04:00.410> and
