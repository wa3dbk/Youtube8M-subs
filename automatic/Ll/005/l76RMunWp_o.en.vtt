 that all deadpool fans can 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:58.780
 rejoice but no matter how much I am 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:02.590
 I am a fan of a dedpl that I donâ€™t care 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:06.440
 but it will be interesting anyway 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.479
 so let's open it so it is artuno 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.600
 here is the actual top should by 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.240
 idea and loki somewhere to be these 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.050
 catalog helmet is not fully 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:23.300
 here is a woman loki or what name i dont 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:26.510
 I know this art tour is rebirth but 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:30.019
 Especially I, too, as with a halk, not particularly 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.820
 carried away by torus but still comics about 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.640
 what with pleasure because in it how 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.890
 Borisovka not like on 3 of us in people 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.750
 ix past days don't like 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.120
 on such a panache old after all 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:45.019
 follower 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:47.680
 modern well someone like it 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:54.850
 says the taste and color mates no 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:57.880
 here is 1 cover here as if 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:05.090
 the cosmic universe is depicted some 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:08.390
 I do not know who it is even I dreamed of dreams 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.940
 here is the torus team as i remember the groove by 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.610
 torda film these two people were 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.980
 it is generally very similar to that 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.430
 was the movie 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.660
 Well, I like the drawing 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.470
 sketching is already great that she is not 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.470
 old 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:34.780
 see here the font first comes here 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:38.810
 so much closer when talking 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.739
 characters then it becomes normal 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:45.859
 alternate 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:47.959
 and in such and in such as I know 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:51.109
 here we will have to tell how 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:54.079
 cake fought in asgard on the fall 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:56.319
 Asgarda with you does not change the memory force 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:04:00.459
 reluctant to believe too 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.459
 suddenly someone wants to read later 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:13.189
 the coffin 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:18.049
 Thunderstorm type here again , the torus is already 2 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:20.389
 cover then it will be interesting somehow 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:26.539
 intertwined as the plot of the first part 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:30.820
 the film here is interesting to me 0 sketch 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:37.250
 I put it perfectly I like panache 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:43.690
 I understand panache is not something that people in the X 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:43.690
 halka time we have tony stark 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:57.239
 and he fights our side 

00:04:54.049 --> 00:05:02.519
 it seems natural to win top 

00:04:57.239 --> 00:05:04.619
 boobs he is god and tony starck is normal 

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:07.559
 man it just his without his 

00:05:04.619 --> 00:05:14.059
 suit for her tony stark at all 

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:14.059
 asgard is useless 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:21.780
 and here is actually that dude who 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:27.469
 depicted on the very first March which 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:32.219
 I showed here by the way probably all the same 

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:34.139
 intertwined with the plot of the film yes here 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:36.810
 I remember this one too 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:39.509
 and in the first part of the film and then I do not remember 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:48.029
 as he called the type he flew there 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:51.680
 destroy the torus opan and this is very 

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:54.810
 cool is my favorite character doctor doom 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.029
 I just don't know what he lost here, but this 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.180
 very cool i hope someday 

00:05:56.029 --> 00:06:01.349
 will publish 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:03.449
 and a comic about doctor doom would be very 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:06.840
 cool well how would it be less popular to 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:09.960
 such a character marvel though he is 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:16.319
 burrows the most important enemy of the fantastic 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:21.169
 fours here is such a comic so 

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:24.300
