00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 hey niklas in the local cinemas it works 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.710
 by two are cooper undercover cop wants 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:13.200
 that a cash register is the stuff of the bond girl 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:15.480
 that's what you're experiencing now I'm too 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.279
 very much to become a cool spies and 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.869
 I am also bored as before 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.400
 you're so sure of number me 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.449
 just want my mother give yours 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.220
 seek out dreams 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.699
 She has me in the lunch box 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.439
 written trainer bayern to want a 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.179
 nuclear weapon to a terrorist 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.399
 You can only sell with us 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.540
 that does not work she knows the identity 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.950
 all our agents 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.630
 we need someone who bombs 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.860
 without flying up I do that 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:44.010
 you'd better with one of her 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.050
 cats as a fortification susan cooper 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.579
 works with that here a more exciting 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.930
 one should actually mean a job 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.280
 the analysts just behind the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.649
 sitting at the desk sees something 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.140
 unlike, however, an agent 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.340
 enemy falls victim and all active 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.890
 agents of a dangerous 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.079
 organization in thailand sees 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.809
 you have the chance on your big adventure 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.729
 if you can take advantage of this opportunity 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.740
 Everything happens to this huge adventure 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.450
 and what else is that going on 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.580
 you find out in the cinema 2 is a 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.409
 agent film but just an agent movie 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.610
 of a slightly different sort and so does that 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.439
 focus here not on exciting 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.180
 chases action or im 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.070
 Factors we use in an agent film 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.320
 expect no he rather lives on it 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.450
 Show that you are not for 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.920
 this job is created 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.930
 what should result from this clearly 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.490
 film English, however, that fails 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.229
 However, the inconsistency of 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.030
 but we first get to script 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.500
 cast willis americans know 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.079
 some series and various hollywood 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.270
 however, their series are running 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.159
 usually a little better that could be too 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.829
 be because that one has their one 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.530
 Liner likes to listen to 20 to 40 minutes 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.600
 but not two hours in spy 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.159
 will be exaggerated here again 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.290
 and above all things in the last third 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.939
 is verbally hewn so much on the plaster 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.250
 that you actually do that 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.590
 do not want to listen or watch anymore 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.899
 what do you mean serienstars he at 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.610
 stay in your series or do not write 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.189
 just below in the comments 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.409
 so jason statham actually has that 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.910
 funniest role of the film and he creates 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.619
 it's even one or the other scene 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.460
 It all sounds very good now 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.680
 dramatically it also has its 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.730
 good moment in a comedy 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.920
 to look for the unexpected, as a rule 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.810
 rather unnecessary but this film makes it 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.670
 actually a two good tests too 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.440
 pack and also the obvious 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.210
 exaggerations really lead to this 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.800
 However, funny posts will be accurate 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.450
 that as synonymous to the next problem 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.590
 yes because if you have a movie one 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.120
 clumsy woman does that 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.920
 probably the most important case of 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.050
 Then you should solve a story 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.400
 I remain loyal to his cause too 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.960
 remember johnny again 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.330
 english because he has his case back then 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.040
 more or less solved with accidents 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.640
 Susan Cooper, however, changes 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.540
 between clumsy and incompetent and 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.220
 breakneck bonns danis with 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.380
 stark fighting back and forth like it 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.320
 her beloved that does not just make the movie 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.150
 even less credible but annoying 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.110
 duration must also be summarized simply 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.240
 So you say more on shallow 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.070
 entertainment is and is not 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.170
 from illogical switch between bond 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.540
 Girl and English disturb housewife 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.310
 He will certainly like the film 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.440
 for everyone else he is rather nothing and 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.810
 Thus, the film gets four of us 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.280
 ten points is currently in the cinema 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.320
 We would rather go to the movies 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.190
 have blu-ray wait apropos blu ray 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.570
 of course, another prize draw 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.040
 for you to win this time 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.890
 there are one of three fan packages 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.630
 consisting of a cat shirt and 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.650
 a blu-ray to blackboard girls if you 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.360
 Wanting to win just write us

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.810

 The whole thing is read through and then 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.520
 decide what comes next now 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.700
 We want the opportunity, however 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.720

 fat off
