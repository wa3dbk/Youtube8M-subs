ready<00:01:37.500> at<00:01:37.619> dawn<00:01:37.799> has<00:01:37.950> pushed<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.310> idea<00:01:38.460> that

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
ready at dawn has pushed the idea that

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.120 
ready at dawn has pushed the idea that
is<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:38.970> filmic<00:01:39.570> cinematic<00:01:40.200> experience<00:01:40.350> it's

is a filmic cinematic experience it's

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.069 
is a filmic cinematic experience it's
like<00:01:41.280> playing<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.670> movie<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.270> by<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.750> look<00:01:42.990> of

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
like playing a movie and by the look of

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
the videos that were put up there not

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.580 
the videos that were put up there not
that<00:01:44.579> wrong<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.570> black<00:01:45.780> bars<00:01:46.079> across<00:01:46.320> the

seamlessly<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.540> game<00:01:51.720> itself<00:01:52.079> looks

seamlessly the game itself looks
fantastic<00:01:52.829> visually<00:01:53.490> which<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.060> impressive

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
fantastic visually which is impressive

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.840 
fantastic visually which is impressive
and<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:55.500> kind<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.829> looks<00:01:56.009> like<00:01:56.100> polish<00:01:56.640> then

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
and it kind of looks like polish then

polish<00:01:57.149> again<00:01:57.420> has<00:01:57.780> been<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.170> philosophy

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
polish again has been the philosophy

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.459 
polish again has been the philosophy
behind<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:59.299> on<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.450> one<00:02:00.600> hand<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:01.079> don't<00:02:01.290> think

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
behind it on the one hand I don't think

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.260 
behind it on the one hand I don't think
we<00:02:01.530> should<00:02:01.560> judge<00:02:01.860> too<00:02:02.070> quickly<00:02:02.100> because<00:02:02.939> even

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
we should judge too quickly because even

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.490 
we should judge too quickly because even
though<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.509> order<00:02:03.750> has<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.899> lot<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.140> stuff<00:02:04.380> that

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
though the order has a lot of stuff that

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.959 
though the order has a lot of stuff that
I<00:02:04.560> don't<00:02:04.710> really<00:02:04.799> want<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.070> see<00:02:05.250> in<00:02:05.310> my<00:02:05.490> games<00:02:05.759> I

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
I don't really want to see in my games I

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.730 
I don't really want to see in my games I
don't<00:02:06.450> think<00:02:06.540> writing<00:02:06.869> something<00:02:07.229> off<00:02:07.530> for

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
don't think writing something off for

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.949 
don't think writing something off for
being<00:02:07.890> too<00:02:08.069> expensive<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.700> clever<00:02:09.090> the

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
being too expensive is that clever the

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.510 
being too expensive is that clever the
biggest<00:02:10.170> issue<00:02:10.410> for<00:02:10.739> me<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:10.920> not<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.280> length

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
biggest issue for me is not the length

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.470 
biggest issue for me is not the length
of<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.819> campaign

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480

much money can get you a hell of a lot
of<00:02:31.470> game<00:02:31.769> I<00:02:31.980> think<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:32.580> order<00:02:32.790> is<00:02:32.879> going<00:02:33.000> to

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
of game I think the order is going to

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.580 
of game I think the order is going to
have<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.239> be<00:02:33.269> pretty<00:02:33.480> damn<00:02:33.870> good<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.290> justify

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
have to be pretty damn good to justify

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.770 
have to be pretty damn good to justify
its<00:02:34.890> price<00:02:35.099> if<00:02:35.370> it<00:02:35.760> can't<00:02:35.940> justify<00:02:36.299> its<00:02:36.540> price

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
its price if it can't justify its price

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.589 
its price if it can't justify its price
but<00:02:37.470> still<00:02:37.769> I<00:02:38.040> don't<00:02:38.879> want<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.150> write<00:02:39.299> it<00:02:39.480> off

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
but still I don't want to write it off

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.319 
but still I don't want to write it off
not<00:02:39.989> yet<00:02:40.200> I'd<00:02:40.739> say<00:02:41.280> be<00:02:41.459> wary<00:02:41.730> of<00:02:41.879> the<00:02:42.060> order

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
not yet I'd say be wary of the order

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.050 
not yet I'd say be wary of the order
don't<00:02:42.870> buy<00:02:43.079> it<00:02:43.140> don't<00:02:43.530> pre-order<00:02:43.860> it<00:02:44.190> look<00:02:44.940> at

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
don't buy it don't pre-order it look at

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.430 
don't buy it don't pre-order it look at
it<00:02:45.120> when<00:02:45.239> we<00:02:45.360> know<00:02:45.510> more<00:02:45.720> when<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.200> video

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
it when we know more when the video

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.930 
it when we know more when the video
start<00:02:46.829> coming<00:02:47.129> when<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.310> review<00:02:47.610> start

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
start coming when the review start

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.550 
start coming when the review start
appearing<00:02:48.209> hopefully<00:02:49.079> then<00:02:49.230> we'll<00:02:49.410> get<00:02:49.500> a

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
appearing hopefully then we'll get a

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.020 
appearing hopefully then we'll get a
better<00:02:49.769> idea<00:02:49.890> of<00:02:50.250> whether<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:50.609> order<00:02:50.879> has

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
better idea of whether the order has

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.610 
better idea of whether the order has
gone<00:02:51.209> for<00:02:51.390> quality<00:02:51.720> over<00:02:51.959> quantity<00:02:51.989> or

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
gone for quality over quantity or

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.380 
gone for quality over quantity or
whether<00:02:53.160> it's<00:02:53.370> just<00:02:53.519> going<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:53.819> under<00:02:54.090> deliver

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
whether it's just going to under deliver

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.039 
whether it's just going to under deliver
but<00:02:55.290> don't<00:02:55.500> write<00:02:55.739> it<00:02:55.920> off<00:02:56.040> not<00:02:56.790> yet<00:02:57.060> I<00:02:57.269> mean<00:02:57.900> if

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
but don't write it off not yet I mean if

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.809 
but don't write it off not yet I mean if
we're<00:02:58.230> really<00:02:58.440> lucky<00:02:58.560> it<00:02:59.370> could<00:02:59.670> actually

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
we're really lucky it could actually

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.979 
we're really lucky it could actually
surprised<00:03:00.359> us<00:03:00.569> I'll<00:03:01.340> see<00:03:02.340> you<00:03:02.400> next<00:03:02.430> time
