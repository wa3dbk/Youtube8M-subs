parallel turn and unlock the movements

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.970 
parallel turn and unlock the movements
for<00:00:23.320> you<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.850> get<00:00:25.210> to<00:00:25.540> how<00:00:26.290> to<00:00:26.350> create<00:00:26.950> a

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
for you to get to how to create a

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.800 
for you to get to how to create a
parallel<00:00:27.340> turn<00:00:27.610> without<00:00:27.940> pushing<00:00:28.330> the<00:00:28.510> skis

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
parallel turn without pushing the skis

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:35.869 
parallel turn without pushing the skis
away<00:00:28.960> but<00:00:29.289> staying<00:00:29.560> in<00:00:29.740> balance<00:00:30.010> over<00:00:30.460> the<00:00:30.580> ski

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.090 

one<00:00:36.879> of<00:00:37.000> the<00:00:37.090> things<00:00:37.420> that<00:00:37.690> we<00:00:37.840> do<00:00:38.140> in<00:00:38.470> skiing

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
one of the things that we do in skiing

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.250 
one of the things that we do in skiing
is<00:00:39.449> we<00:00:40.680> start<00:00:41.680> to<00:00:41.920> learn<00:00:42.160> get<00:00:43.000> a<00:00:43.239> movement<00:00:43.870> like

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
is we start to learn get a movement like

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.580 
is we start to learn get a movement like
tipping<00:00:44.829> the<00:00:45.040> ski<00:00:45.340> is<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.899> with<00:00:47.140> the<00:00:47.290> foot

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
tipping the ski is this with the foot

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.139 
tipping the ski is this with the foot
and<00:00:47.800> the<00:00:47.950> leg<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:49.660> movement<00:00:50.170> starts<00:00:50.880> with<00:00:51.880> my

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
and the leg that movement starts with my

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.200 
and the leg that movement starts with my
foot<00:00:52.570> inside<00:00:53.140> the<00:00:53.350> ski<00:00:53.590> boot<00:00:53.880> transfers<00:00:54.880> to<00:00:55.059> my

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
foot inside the ski boot transfers to my

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.930 
foot inside the ski boot transfers to my
ankle<00:00:55.750> my<00:00:55.930> ankle<00:00:55.960> pushes<00:00:56.829> to<00:00:57.280> the<00:00:57.430> side<00:00:57.700> of<00:00:57.850> the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
ankle my ankle pushes to the side of the

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.870 
ankle my ankle pushes to the side of the
boot<00:00:58.180> and<00:00:58.390> then<00:00:59.110> my<00:00:59.350> leg<00:00:59.620> moves<00:00:59.980> above<00:01:00.640> that

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880 
boot and then my leg moves above that

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.330 
boot and then my leg moves above that
push<00:01:01.210> so<00:01:01.930> if<00:01:02.079> I'm<00:01:02.230> going<00:01:02.379> to<00:01:02.440> push<00:01:02.649> my<00:01:02.680> ankle

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
push so if I'm going to push my ankle

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.719 
push so if I'm going to push my ankle
towards<00:01:04.210> the<00:01:04.979> outside<00:01:05.979> of<00:01:06.040> the<00:01:06.220> boot<00:01:06.399> here

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
towards the outside of the boot here

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.540 
towards the outside of the boot here
that<00:01:07.720> creates<00:01:08.200> a<00:01:08.380> tipping<00:01:08.770> action<00:01:09.100> of<00:01:09.160> the<00:01:09.280> ski

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
that creates a tipping action of the ski

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.609 
that creates a tipping action of the ski
and<00:01:09.729> the<00:01:10.030> leg<00:01:10.240> follow<00:01:10.600> so<00:01:11.020> you're<00:01:11.380> going<00:01:11.560> to

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
and the leg follow so you're going to

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.760 
and the leg follow so you're going to
see<00:01:11.920> this<00:01:12.220> movement<00:01:13.090> right<00:01:13.240> there<00:01:13.710> okay<00:01:14.710> so

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
see this movement right there okay so

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.440 
see this movement right there okay so
I'm<00:01:15.070> going<00:01:15.190> to<00:01:15.280> show<00:01:15.490> you<00:01:15.549> at<00:01:15.760> a<00:01:15.790> direct<00:01:16.240> angle

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
I'm going to show you at a direct angle

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.550 
I'm going to show you at a direct angle
like<00:01:16.810> so<00:01:17.080> if<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:18.430> tip<00:01:18.820> my<00:01:19.030> right<00:01:19.360> foot<00:01:19.720> towards

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
like so if I tip my right foot towards

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.880 
like so if I tip my right foot towards
the<00:01:21.460> little<00:01:21.700> toe<00:01:22.000> edge<00:01:22.320> I'm<00:01:23.320> going<00:01:23.650> to<00:01:23.710> get<00:01:23.860> a

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
the little toe edge I'm going to get a

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.830 
the little toe edge I'm going to get a
movement<00:01:24.400> where<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.640> ski<00:01:25.000> goes<00:01:25.390> on<00:01:25.600> to<00:01:25.720> the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
movement where the ski goes on to the

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.520 
movement where the ski goes on to the
edge<00:01:26.040> my<00:01:27.040> knee<00:01:27.150> follows<00:01:28.150> and<00:01:28.510> people<00:01:29.080> will<00:01:29.290> see

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
edge my knee follows and people will see

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.219 
edge my knee follows and people will see
the<00:01:29.710> knee<00:01:29.860> and<00:01:30.010> they'll<00:01:30.159> say<00:01:30.369> oh<00:01:30.750> yeah<00:01:31.750> he's

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
the knee and they'll say oh yeah he's

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:33.929 
the knee and they'll say oh yeah he's
pushing<00:01:32.439> his<00:01:32.740> knee<00:01:32.950> out<00:01:32.979> but<00:01:33.430> that's<00:01:33.549> not

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
pushing his knee out but that's not

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:35.820 
pushing his knee out but that's not
really<00:01:34.390> the<00:01:34.540> answer<00:01:34.900> that's<00:01:35.020> not<00:01:35.170> the<00:01:35.439> key<00:01:35.680> to

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
really the answer that's not the key to

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.130 
really the answer that's not the key to
unlocking<00:01:36.340> the<00:01:36.640> movement<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.689> key<00:01:37.990> to

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
unlocking the movement the key to

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.870 
unlocking the movement the key to
unlocking<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.770> movement<00:01:39.100> is<00:01:39.220> with<00:01:39.460> your<00:01:39.580> foot

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
unlocking the movement is with your foot

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.270 
unlocking the movement is with your foot
and<00:01:40.119> your<00:01:40.360> ankle<00:01:40.780> in<00:01:40.930> the<00:01:40.960> boot<00:01:41.320> it<00:01:41.890> creates

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
and your ankle in the boot it creates

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.039 
and your ankle in the boot it creates
that<00:01:42.369> movement<00:01:42.850> now<00:01:42.939> once<00:01:43.150> you<00:01:43.299> start<00:01:43.720> with

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
that movement now once you start with

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.710 
that movement now once you start with
that<00:01:44.259> movement<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.850> skis<00:01:46.210> going<00:01:46.390> to<00:01:46.479> want<00:01:46.630> to

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
that movement that skis going to want to

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.020 
that movement that skis going to want to
turn<00:01:47.080> and<00:01:47.470> it<00:01:47.560> will<00:01:47.710> help<00:01:47.890> turn<00:01:48.250> but<00:01:48.909> you're

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
turn and it will help turn but you're

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.880 
turn and it will help turn but you're
not<00:01:49.180> putting<00:01:49.420> weight<00:01:49.780> on<00:01:49.990> that<00:01:50.020> ski<00:01:50.500> you're

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
not putting weight on that ski you're

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.649 
not putting weight on that ski you're
not<00:01:51.009> pressing<00:01:51.549> that<00:01:51.790> ski<00:01:52.180> down<00:01:52.420> you're

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
not pressing that ski down you're

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.469 
not pressing that ski down you're
actually<00:01:52.930> lightening<00:01:53.470> it<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:55.060> may<00:01:55.240> leave<00:01:55.420> a

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
actually lightening it you may leave a

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.030 
actually lightening it you may leave a
little<00:01:55.750> pressure<00:01:56.140> on<00:01:56.350> the<00:01:56.470> tip<00:01:56.680> of<00:01:56.829> the<00:01:56.920> ski

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
little pressure on the tip of the ski

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.800 
little pressure on the tip of the ski
which<00:01:57.310> helps<00:01:57.670> it<00:01:57.790> make<00:01:58.060> this<00:01:58.210> curve<00:01:58.540> right

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
which helps it make this curve right

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.710 
which helps it make this curve right
here<00:01:59.460> now<00:02:00.460> what's<00:02:00.729> going<00:02:01.060> on<00:02:01.210> here<00:02:01.479> is<00:02:01.570> the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
here now what's going on here is the

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.830 
here now what's going on here is the
other<00:02:01.810> one's<00:02:02.079> got<00:02:02.229> to<00:02:02.380> do<00:02:02.500> the<00:02:02.650> same<00:02:02.860> thing<00:02:03.840> so

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
other one's got to do the same thing so

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.530 
other one's got to do the same thing so
when<00:02:05.710> you<00:02:05.829> make<00:02:06.009> this<00:02:06.310> movement<00:02:06.670> that<00:02:07.210> ski

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
when you make this movement that ski

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.300 
when you make this movement that ski
this<00:02:07.960> ski<00:02:08.200> is<00:02:08.259> lighter<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.769> one<00:02:08.890> I'm<00:02:08.979> picking

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
this ski is lighter the one I'm picking

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.160 
this ski is lighter the one I'm picking
up<00:02:09.399> is<00:02:09.579> obviously<00:02:10.000> a<00:02:10.119> not<00:02:10.360> on<00:02:10.540> the<00:02:10.660> snow<00:02:10.899> as

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
up is obviously a not on the snow as

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.350 
up is obviously a not on the snow as
much<00:02:11.620> and<00:02:11.920> my<00:02:12.820> focus<00:02:13.470> focus<00:02:14.470> of<00:02:14.620> my<00:02:14.739> whole<00:02:14.950> body

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.819 
much and my focus focus of my whole body
balance<00:02:16.360> is<00:02:16.540> switched<00:02:16.870> over<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.380> this<00:02:17.650> other

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829 
balance is switched over to this other

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.699 
balance is switched over to this other
leg<00:02:18.160> so<00:02:19.150> I'm<00:02:19.329> lightening<00:02:19.959> this<00:02:20.079> foot<00:02:20.410> which

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
leg so I'm lightening this foot which

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.670 
leg so I'm lightening this foot which
switch<00:02:21.070> is<00:02:21.250> my<00:02:21.430> balance<00:02:21.910> over<00:02:22.239> and<00:02:22.450> tip<00:02:23.380> this

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
switch is my balance over and tip this

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.660 
switch is my balance over and tip this
foot<00:02:23.980> which

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
foot which

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.990 
foot which
creates<00:02:25.030> and<00:02:25.360> a<00:02:26.020> reaction<00:02:26.800> to<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.520> other<00:02:27.640> ski

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
creates and a reaction to the other ski

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.600 
creates and a reaction to the other ski
as<00:02:28.150> well<00:02:28.360> so<00:02:29.170> now<00:02:29.380> I've<00:02:29.590> got<00:02:29.739> both<00:02:30.010> skis<00:02:30.400> on

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
as well so now I've got both skis on

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.370 
as well so now I've got both skis on
edge<00:02:30.849> and<00:02:31.180> I'm<00:02:32.110> creating<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.560> parallel<00:02:32.950> turn

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
edge and I'm creating a parallel turn

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.660 
edge and I'm creating a parallel turn
the<00:02:35.380> reason<00:02:35.800> that<00:02:35.920> happens<00:02:36.370> is<00:02:36.489> because

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
the reason that happens is because

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.750 
the reason that happens is because
you're<00:02:37.030> not<00:02:37.209> pushing<00:02:37.989> the<00:02:38.140> ski<00:02:38.410> away<00:02:38.760> you're

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
you're not pushing the ski away you're

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.030 
you're not pushing the ski away you're
leaving<00:02:40.330> it<00:02:40.480> right<00:02:40.870> under<00:02:41.230> your<00:02:41.410> hips<00:02:41.739> and

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
leaving it right under your hips and

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.940 
leaving it right under your hips and
that's<00:02:42.819> really<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.239> key<00:02:43.450> stay<00:02:44.200> over<00:02:44.739> your

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
that's really the key stay over your

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.660 
that's really the key stay over your
skis<00:02:45.190> and<00:02:45.459> stay<00:02:45.760> balanced<00:02:46.330> over<00:02:46.540> your<00:02:46.690> skis

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
skis and stay balanced over your skis

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.490 
skis and stay balanced over your skis
your<00:02:48.670> head<00:02:48.940> your<00:02:49.270> chin<00:02:49.600> should<00:02:49.900> be<00:02:50.050> over<00:02:50.350> your

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
your head your chin should be over your

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.800 
your head your chin should be over your
boots<00:02:51.040> between<00:02:51.550> your<00:02:51.730> boots<00:02:51.910> all<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.330> time

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
boots between your boots all the time

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.320 
boots between your boots all the time
so<00:02:53.560> when<00:02:53.950> you<00:02:54.040> start<00:02:54.370> your<00:02:54.430> chipping<00:02:54.760> action

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
so when you start your chipping action

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.930 
so when you start your chipping action
your<00:02:55.989> lower<00:02:56.410> body<00:02:56.800> moves<00:02:57.250> to<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.459> side<00:02:57.670> but

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
your lower body moves to the side but

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.150 
your lower body moves to the side but
notice<00:02:58.239> my<00:02:58.390> upper<00:02:58.569> body<00:02:58.930> did<00:02:59.380> not<00:02:59.410> move<00:02:59.920> to<00:03:00.130> the

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
notice my upper body did not move to the

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.680 
notice my upper body did not move to the
inside<00:03:00.450> this<00:03:01.500> causes<00:03:02.500> a<00:03:02.530> lien<00:03:02.890> and<00:03:03.160> it<00:03:03.280> causes

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
inside this causes a lien and it causes

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:10.350 
inside this causes a lien and it causes
you<00:03:04.690> to<00:03:04.720> fall<00:03:05.440> over<00:03:06.660> so<00:03:08.519> those<00:03:09.519> are<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:09.850> basic

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
you to fall over so those are the basic

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.930 
you to fall over so those are the basic
movements<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:11.110> that's<00:03:12.040> how<00:03:12.250> you<00:03:12.310> transfer

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
movements and that's how you transfer

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.690 
movements and that's how you transfer
balance<00:03:13.360> by<00:03:13.540> lightening<00:03:14.140> one<00:03:14.319> foot<00:03:14.700> rather

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
balance by lightening one foot rather

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.850 
balance by lightening one foot rather
than<00:03:16.030> pushing<00:03:16.540> yourself<00:03:17.140> into<00:03:17.530> a<00:03:17.560> turn

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
than pushing yourself into a turn

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.910 
than pushing yourself into a turn
whenever<00:03:18.670> you<00:03:18.850> push<00:03:19.239> with<00:03:19.480> your<00:03:19.510> legs<00:03:20.019> you

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
whenever you push with your legs you

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.289 
whenever you push with your legs you
push<00:03:21.190> your<00:03:21.430> body<00:03:21.640> you're<00:03:21.910> pushing<00:03:22.239> yourself

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
push your body you're pushing yourself

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.110 
push your body you're pushing yourself
out<00:03:22.720> of<00:03:22.870> balance<00:03:23.370> you're<00:03:24.370> sliding<00:03:24.640> your<00:03:24.910> ski

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
out of balance you're sliding your ski

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.860 
out of balance you're sliding your ski
away<00:03:25.410> now<00:03:26.410> I'm<00:03:26.680> my<00:03:27.400> head<00:03:27.610> is<00:03:27.760> inside<00:03:27.940> that<00:03:28.180> ski

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
away now I'm my head is inside that ski

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.530 
away now I'm my head is inside that ski
which<00:03:29.170> means<00:03:29.440> I'm<00:03:29.590> losing<00:03:29.980> my<00:03:30.160> balance<00:03:30.540> okay

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540
