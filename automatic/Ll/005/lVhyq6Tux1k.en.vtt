make the little tiny s hooks so I start

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.720 
make the little tiny s hooks so I start
by<00:00:43.050> grabbing<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.530> tip<00:00:45.590> like<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.620> it's<00:00:47.550> hard

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
by grabbing the tip like this it's hard

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.819 
by grabbing the tip like this it's hard
to<00:00:47.850> see<00:00:48.030> it's<00:00:48.210> blurry<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.719> know<00:00:48.870> I'm<00:00:49.200> sorry<00:00:49.440> but

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
to see it's blurry I know I'm sorry but

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.310 
to see it's blurry I know I'm sorry but
it's<00:00:50.039> camera<00:00:50.399> doesn't<00:00:50.579> like<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.969> focus<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.809> I

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
it's camera doesn't like the focus and I

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.970 
it's camera doesn't like the focus and I
just<00:00:52.530> rotate<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.070> around<00:00:54.410> so<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.620> have<00:00:55.949> a

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
just rotate it around so that I have a

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.330 
just rotate it around so that I have a
sort<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.550> like<00:00:57.420> fish<00:00:57.690> hook<00:00:57.989> if<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:59.010> can<00:00:59.129> see

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
sort of like fish hook if you can see

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.579 
sort of like fish hook if you can see
that<00:01:01.370> and<00:01:02.370> then<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.210> open<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.809> up<00:01:03.899> just<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.559> little

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
that and then I open it up just a little

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.050 
that and then I open it up just a little
bit<00:01:05.010> because<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.339> need<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.640> be<00:01:05.820> able<00:01:05.909> to

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
bit because you need it to be able to

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.170 
bit because you need it to be able to
take<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.510> hand<00:01:07.460> so<00:01:08.460> there<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.820> go

bend<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.460> back<00:01:41.760> and<00:01:41.970> forth

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.380 

now<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.450> have<00:01:48.660> a<00:01:48.690> little<00:01:48.870> s<00:01:49.050> hook<00:01:49.880> and<00:01:50.880> then<00:01:51.360> I

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
now you have a little s hook and then I

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.150 
now you have a little s hook and then I
use<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.810> pliers<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.380> flatten<00:01:52.410> it<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:53.010> little

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
smaller dolls like her just because her

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.729 
smaller dolls like her just because her
arms<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:11.440> stuff<00:02:11.650> are<00:02:11.890> so<00:02:12.130> small<00:02:13.440> so<00:02:14.440> that

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
arms and stuff are so small so that

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.170 
arms and stuff are so small so that
we'll<00:02:14.890> grab<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.400> cord<00:02:15.700> really<00:02:16.120> well<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:18.370> that

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
we'll grab the cord really well and that

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.880 
we'll grab the cord really well and that
is<00:02:19.330> how<00:02:19.480> I<00:02:19.510> do<00:02:19.660> my<00:02:19.780> restring<00:02:20.319> for<00:02:20.560> my<00:02:20.680> little
