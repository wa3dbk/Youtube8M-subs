00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:25.160
 hello people well answering questions 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:27.590
 made on the portal site br x.com today I 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.980
 I'll answer Julian's question 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:34.250
 Who asked me to talk about bottleneck? 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.950
 or those ones and have a good equipment 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.500
 and has a bottleneck to a fall of 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.110
 performance on your device 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.630
 I'll explain to you the main thing. 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.530
 cause you have a bottleneck 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:52.390
 What are you, an equipment that is not 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:56.120
 equivalent to everyone in all parts 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:01:00.050
 included in that example you have a board 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:04.339
 super powerful video you put 32gb 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:09.979
 memory puts a zero radius 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:12.259
 ssd sure and has a bad processor you 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.689
 will have a bottleneck that the processor will not 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.150
 Are you going to work all that? 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:20.300
 right there you have the equipment very 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.510
 Large ram is very potent 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.180
 Sometimes it is and it has equipment. 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.770
 every potent plus a quantity of 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.120
 low ram 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.220
 The secret to not having a bottleneck exists 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.600
 the issue of software also 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.640
 programmed wrong wrong computer 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.600
 configured mainly the most 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:47.150
 happens in the consultancies that I 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.570
 maintenance to optimize a computer is 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.790
 the computer is poorly configured to 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.770
 people and lowering both programs 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.840
 program the times the speed of 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.150
 internet this program to download more 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.040
 fast this program is to use a rack 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:07.430
 in the game making yours all that bad 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:10.480
 selected right or misconfigured you 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.560
 will lose performance this equipment at 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:16.489
 setting up a machine 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.189
 the pieces chosen according to the 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:23.870
 type of game you want for example 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:27.040
 games like mm it's dota love 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.260
 are games that do not require wide 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.170
 the performance of the video card but 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.180
 require a slightly higher 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.219
 processor does not mean that the 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.299
 processor has to be more powerful 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:43.329
 this is not a balance but there are 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:47.079
 levels of use games that require 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:49.299
 more frog games that requires more cpu more 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:52.180
 gpu and so on 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:55.620
 there is a wide variation of it by 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:00.280
 This is important for you to have the equipment 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:03.430
 well married those that are equivalent 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.319
 the work as a whole is no use 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.510
 very powerful video card one 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:12.370
 very powerful processor an overclocking 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:15.639
 on a part without the assembly being 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.609
 well balanced is this that brings the 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:20.620
 ideal performance and not choosing 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:23.650
 all with plenty who will spend one 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.439
 fortune and can still suffer from bottleneck 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:31.120
 in the same way if the machine has not 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:36.250
 well optimized well configured ok 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:39.639
 another detail is the bottleneck is you 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.859
 the temperature of the computer and has the 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:44.409
 equipment poorly designed it may 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:46.900
 that he will overcome heat and will 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:49.919
 decrease the performance of these parts 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.760
 well then everything has to be good 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:58.510
 the problem of the larger bottleneck is 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:00.310
 the poor choice of parts where you listen 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.440
 a lot of people, I do not want to know more 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.540
 I realized I bought the pc 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.720
 six months later it is already obsolete 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.419
 because it is obsolete because the parts that 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.720
 have been selected for you 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:16.239
 selected the store seller 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.250
 obviously selected seller goes 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.099
 select what he has to sell and 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:24.820
 not that you really need 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:27.610
 right then the most important is the 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.509
 correct selection of parts 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:33.610
 work well with each other a machine 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:34.690
 correctly configured to have the best 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.000
 performance 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.340
 If you want to get in 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.960
 to make an optimization do 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.419
 an analysis of the equipment 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.460
 You 're just getting in touch and kind of 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.680
 description of the video we make a 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.680
 I'm going to see the 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.810
 you remote access analyze photos and 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.240
 find out everything that is wrong 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:59.800
 to optimize for you to have the best 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:02.710
 performance in case you do not want to follow 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:06.190
 My right tips and analysis 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:10.210
 compare well the components of the 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:12.729
 the needs of the games that 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.330
 there is every game he has there 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:19.150
 recommended minimum average setting 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:22.539
 to run it helps a lot to 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:25.630
 You're trying to find this 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:28.509
 configuration it's up to you to analyze 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:31.360
 all the games you want to get 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:34.900
 to an ideal setting wedding that 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:38.409
 he will attend is my job 15 years ago 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:42.220
 I analyze the wrong software and games and 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:44.800
 I already know what fits best in 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:48.009
 all these cases only I need 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.900
 know the case of each person to join 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:51.070
 with my knowledge and determine the 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.830
 What 's best for her? 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:56.620
 Okay, a big personal hug does not get 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:59.770
 forget to subscribe to the channel leave 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:03.250
 Your name was meant to share. 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:06.610
 obviously ok and participate as always 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:09.610
 a big hug and until the next video to
