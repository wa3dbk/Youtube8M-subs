00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
screenshots of the game I think that's

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.609 
screenshots of the game I think that's
how<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.430> am<00:01:47.729> how<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.810> looks<00:01:49.049> but<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.439> graphics

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
how I am how it looks but the graphics

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.100 
how I am how it looks but the graphics
obviously<00:01:50.159> aren't<00:01:50.369> great<00:01:50.670> are<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.960> not

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
obviously aren't great are the not

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.889 
obviously aren't great are the not
obviously<00:01:52.350> full-blown<00:01:52.860> ps3<00:01:53.579> but<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.689> is

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
obviously full-blown ps3 but it is it is

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.530 
obviously full-blown ps3 but it is it is
only<00:01:55.140> like<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.470> PSN<00:01:56.100> game<00:01:56.310> but<00:01:56.640> I'd<00:01:56.850> still<00:01:57.210> think

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
only like a PSN game but I'd still think

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.090 
only like a PSN game but I'd still think
this<00:01:57.659> game<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:58.170> perfect<00:01:58.619> fit<00:01:58.770> on<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.950> beat
