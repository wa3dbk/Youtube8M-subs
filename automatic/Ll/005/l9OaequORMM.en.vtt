00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.600
 so what's going on my friends i am 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.430
 back to a start in this whole 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.379
 very big project in this very whole 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.780
 big house and we are at the moment 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.760
 this office inside in this corner you 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.800
 you can not see anything at all 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.600
 quasi this act is still empty and 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.040
 I have a question for my subscriber 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.000
 Of course, under the video in the 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.670
 Write comments 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.759
 what should best come here 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.499
 I hesitate another table what do I know for 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.199
 you a big trees write yours 

00:00:34.499 --> 00:00:39.420
 opinion to it and I will 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:41.940
 install later in this house so 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.039
 an open window is almost the first 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.719
 open windows in this very big 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:47.670
 This house has been almost ten years 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.519
 luck, he could theoretically 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.809
 make a game like this again 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:53.399
 one would have to rest altogether 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.139
 calculate how lucky we are at all 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.940
 the house has so I have 

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:58.889
 But that's just starting 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.769
 a little bit because of the interiors 

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:03.749
 so to speak, and that heals, but that lasts 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:04.799
 You could say that directly 

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:06.900
 It's over 10 million or already 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.580
 Local over 15 years of activity are included 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.890
 events now see same locked 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.750
 through the house fly direction street 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.720
 and the biggest one I've extended the web 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.030
 on 36 times that means we can continue 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.920
 not only build a house but even 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.380
 still quite different buildings for example 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.840
 Maybe a swimming pool will drive you 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.360
 completely different stuff and just the one 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.980
 Hammer because alone the house is even 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.650
 the Bernese among us if you are honest 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.320
 because that's about over the hours 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.840
 took all this build up, so to speak 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.300
 alone and together with friends and 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.760
 how you can see it that way 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.350
 just from whole perspectives 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.510
 You can not go hammergeil photos 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.280
 you are in these premises 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.140
 we have our turn, we have everything 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.460
 already built today and of course later 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.260
 and shopping center but as I said 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.570
 Of course that will happen too 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.100
 Here and here we have a small one 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.960
 cabinet as you can reintun paper 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.650
 donors as in real life then have 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.170
 here we have a computer a computer 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.310
 paper container or am 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.880
 Trash where to throw paper 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:12.450
 then we can have one 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:15.190
 exactly the same survival world a boy 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.750
 I have a tree directly like that 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.310
 implanted that you can see it too 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.019
 how tall that is now I imagine 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.640
 This year already I wanted that 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:34.420
 Of course not because they do otherwise 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:37.930
 we have the 11 01 2011 01 21 1 3112 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.180
 people at us already and that google 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.190
 bild 4 on the page for google knows yes 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.989
 Each of you and the Google definitely determines google 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.980
 whole files and facts then we have 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.080
 a copier 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.910
 that was a bit difficult now 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.709
 Let's go into the room of the gamer 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.180
 room inside and he is of course already 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.040
 more but the first picture already has 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.830
 Colleague of mine made the village picture 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.569
 I also did it myself 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.430
 do not walk but he has it alone 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.230
 made hammergeil thank you very much for this 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.849
 put on tight and now we fly 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.920
 times 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:07.959
 and here is over exaggerated construction site 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.640
 Alone here this is all still 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.530
 Built to be in this one now 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.630
 hobby space rhine sees you know the yes 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.910
 hobby room but without the coca cola wanted 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.489
 we get a bullet in the head 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.400
 wanted to head then it went up 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.780
 and when you are up we are here now 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.670
 to have these things too long 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.260
 extended here on the left side 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.540
 no idea what that is i have 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.739
 just built after me just once 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.139
 Maybe this is the only way to build it again 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:35.530
 make a 3d picture but still there 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:36.700
 my own truest already often yes me yes 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.959
 You can give me my comments 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.799
 we write the game so find 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.500
 in my opinion 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.180
 I have to tear it off so on the right 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.950
 side is the bedroom and again 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.109
 on the far right is the nursery if the 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.639
 want to look at the exact right up here 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.410
 youtube then you just go the 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:52.870
 previous videos with me on my channel 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.370
 there you will find the bedroom and the 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.220
 bmx if you use the bathroom 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.109
 Nursery bedroom national and 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.980
 also the garage as well as have several 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.900
 building or 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.790
 not yet that comes as I said but 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.599
 We have so many rooms already 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:10.359
 unlike this object so fabius the 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.230
 small fish then there's the obama 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:13.989
 small bathroom 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.930
 then we have this right here 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.959
 the pokÃ©mon species per day he is 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.500
 I believe 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:24.169
 so and next year the garage the picture 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.330
 I have done recently 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.919
 and how do you find the picture of the 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.240
 optics ago that was difficult own 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:31.009
 have a total of two and a half hours 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.910
 used the season so that goes 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:36.530
 gta 5 gt5 for that have six and a half 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:41.180
 hours needed as we go nevertheless times 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:44.479
 but only immediately or I think 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.970
 he is called there or he looks at the present 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:48.500
 I do not think so still there 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.849
 was still my picture what I was 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.180
 Now we are lying 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:52.639
 Out 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.289
 ok, I've changed my mind 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:56.240
 the videos have been there since you can find 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:57.620
 also that gta picture is the very fat logo 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.870
 used six and a half hours of staff 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.060

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.030

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:23.270
 tongue neeson has this blog this 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:27.190

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:39.650
 as I actually meant by the mass 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.330
 from the blocks the 100,000 gap who 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.919

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:46.969
 tenants and of course we have too 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:49.130
 Here we are in the dark lanterns

 press no circuit will be in the 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:56.930
 but it makes you completely alone 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:06:01.729
 Now we come here to the mass 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:06.080

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.560

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.990
