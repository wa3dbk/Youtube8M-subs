00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
like I said someone suggested that I

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.350 
like I said someone suggested that I
start<00:01:07.729> taking<00:01:08.710> biotin<00:01:09.710> or<00:01:10.040> vitamin<00:01:10.700> B<00:01:10.820> and<00:01:11.180> all

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
start taking biotin or vitamin B and all

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.959 
start taking biotin or vitamin B and all
that<00:01:11.600> to<00:01:12.500> kind<00:01:12.710> of<00:01:12.770> wean<00:01:12.979> myself<00:01:13.219> off<00:01:13.549> instead

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:13.969 
that to kind of wean myself off instead

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:16.330 
that to kind of wean myself off instead
of<00:01:14.270> just<00:01:14.450> stopping<00:01:14.750> cold<00:01:15.170> turkey<00:01:15.590> so<00:01:15.829> I<00:01:16.039> think

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
of just stopping cold turkey so I think

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.590 
of just stopping cold turkey so I think
that<00:01:16.819> is<00:01:17.030> worth<00:01:17.270> a<00:01:17.479> try<00:01:17.509> and<00:01:18.139> it's<00:01:18.350> a<00:01:18.530> good<00:01:18.799> idea

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
that is worth a try and it's a good idea

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.620 
that is worth a try and it's a good idea
to<00:01:20.600> kind<00:01:20.780> of<00:01:20.929> just<00:01:21.170> lower<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:22.039> dosage<00:01:22.670> and<00:01:22.969> not

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
to kind of just lower the dosage and not

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.359 
to kind of just lower the dosage and not
have<00:01:23.840> my<00:01:23.959> body<00:01:24.200> go<00:01:24.350> into<00:01:24.380> a<00:01:24.649> complete<00:01:25.100> state<00:01:25.340> of

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
vitamin again I didn't experience the

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.759 
vitamin again I didn't experience the
growth<00:04:08.230> like<00:04:08.620> I<00:04:08.769> said<00:04:09.069> with<00:04:09.340> Hairfinity<00:04:09.760> and

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
growth like I said with Hairfinity and

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.800 
growth like I said with Hairfinity and
all<00:04:11.769> the<00:04:12.069> properties<00:04:12.549> that<00:04:12.579> happen<00:04:13.090> he<00:04:13.180> has<00:04:13.209> it

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
all the properties that happen he has it

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.929 
all the properties that happen he has it
seems<00:04:14.079> like<00:04:14.230> it<00:04:14.409> has<00:04:14.469> most<00:04:15.040> of<00:04:15.250> that<00:04:15.370> stuff<00:04:15.670> in

00:04:15.929 --> 00:04:15.939 
seems like it has most of that stuff in

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:18.990 
seems like it has most of that stuff in
your<00:04:16.209> like<00:04:16.829> silica<00:04:17.829> I<00:04:18.160> know<00:04:18.250> her<00:04:18.549> fitting<00:04:18.880> is

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
your like silica I know her fitting is

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.539 
your like silica I know her fitting is
to<00:04:19.269> have<00:04:19.449> aloe<00:04:19.930> or<00:04:20.259> grape<00:04:20.560> skin<00:04:20.859> and<00:04:20.979> abstracts

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
to have aloe or grape skin and abstracts

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.820 
to have aloe or grape skin and abstracts
or<00:04:21.940> anything<00:04:22.210> but<00:04:22.509> it<00:04:22.599> does<00:04:22.750> have<00:04:22.960> the<00:04:23.110> MSM<00:04:23.650> in

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
or anything but it does have the MSM in

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.740 
or anything but it does have the MSM in
there<00:04:24.039> but<00:04:24.669> it<00:04:24.729> doesn't<00:04:25.030> have<00:04:25.180> as<00:04:25.330> much<00:04:25.509> as<00:04:25.720> a

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
there but it doesn't have as much as a

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.450 
there but it doesn't have as much as a
Hairfinity<00:04:26.229> so<00:04:26.259> maybe<00:04:27.009> that's<00:04:27.340> the

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
Hairfinity so maybe that's the

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.640 
Hairfinity so maybe that's the
difference<00:04:27.910> between<00:04:28.000> these<00:04:28.449> two<00:04:28.750> it's<00:04:29.380> the

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
difference between these two it's the

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.060 
difference between these two it's the
quantity<00:04:29.919> of<00:04:30.160> the<00:04:30.789> ingredients<00:04:31.419> that<00:04:32.349> are<00:04:32.919> in

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
quantity of the ingredients that are in

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.730 
quantity of the ingredients that are in
this<00:04:33.580> vitamin<00:04:34.000> but<00:04:34.360> after<00:04:35.020> I<00:04:35.080> did<00:04:35.289> a<00:04:35.320> whole<00:04:35.590> lot

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
this vitamin but after I did a whole lot

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.760 
this vitamin but after I did a whole lot
of<00:04:35.860> research<00:04:36.220> online<00:04:36.870> about<00:04:37.870> this<00:04:38.199> a<00:04:38.410> lot<00:04:38.680> of

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
of research online about this a lot of

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.469 
of research online about this a lot of
