you<00:00:30.060> know<00:00:30.090> interesting<00:00:30.390> features<00:00:31.050> we're

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
you know interesting features we're

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.620 
you know interesting features we're
basically<00:00:31.619> on<00:00:31.769> top<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.340> two<00:00:32.669> physical

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
basically on top of the two physical

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.660 
basically on top of the two physical
cores<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.290> this<00:00:34.440> thing<00:00:34.649> has<00:00:34.860> it'll<00:00:35.520> actually

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
cores that this thing has it'll actually

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.610 
cores that this thing has it'll actually
give<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.030> an<00:00:36.149> additional<00:00:36.360> two<00:00:36.840> virtual<00:00:37.290> cores

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
give you an additional two virtual cores

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.229 
give you an additional two virtual cores
when<00:00:38.250> you're<00:00:38.370> using<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.700> pretty<00:00:38.969> demanding

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
when you're using a pretty demanding

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.650 
when you're using a pretty demanding
application<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.320> with<00:00:40.860> i7<00:00:41.120> processor<00:00:42.120> you

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
application and with i7 processor you

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.360 
application and with i7 processor you
are<00:00:42.870> going<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.140> get<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:43.590> thing<00:00:43.800> called<00:00:43.980> turbo

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
are going to get this thing called turbo

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.040 
are going to get this thing called turbo
boost<00:00:44.579> we're<00:00:45.210> basically<00:00:45.539> it'll<00:00:45.840> actually

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
boost we're basically it'll actually

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.979 
boost we're basically it'll actually
overclock<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.860> processor<00:00:47.070> for<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.149> when

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
overclock the processor for you when

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.900 
overclock the processor for you when
it's<00:00:49.320> needed<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:49.860> also<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.370> know<00:00:50.640> when<00:00:50.820> you're

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
it's needed so also you know when you're

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.970 
it's needed so also you know when you're
using<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.270> pretty<00:00:51.719> demanding<00:00:51.989> application<00:00:52.770> now
