all the motion controls this could

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.610 
all the motion controls this could

fully portable gaming device it can do
more<00:05:04.560> than<00:05:04.590> that<00:05:04.770> we<00:05:04.890> can<00:05:05.070> do<00:05:05.190> and<00:05:05.400> it<00:05:06.060> can<00:05:06.210> be

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
more than that we can do and it can be

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.890 
more than that we can do and it can be
portable<00:05:07.010> so<00:05:08.010> why<00:05:08.850> buy<00:05:09.120> a<00:05:09.150> wii<00:05:09.450> when<00:05:09.690> you<00:05:09.750> can
