 and fanny the claudine scheme that you 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.279
 presents the series the different 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.260
 hypertrophy methods in bodybuilding 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.790
 today a very method 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.619
 interesting in this case will cut 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.710
 tired like his friend we'll be coming 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:32.140
 near tiredness is a muscle often a 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.480
 weak point moreover first on a 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.650
 analytical exercise today the wind 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.150
 to lembeye but beware a wind to 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.160
 very specific lambert that fanni is going 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.020
 to present to us at least glutes and 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.480
 we will follow behind with a super 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.340
 earth legs outstretched pay attention to these 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.739
 info to friends a young stretched leg 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.809
 have locked to solicit the fact 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.489
 if you tell us a little more about 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:56.710
 lesson that it was a bit that we believe 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:58.719
 weak the specifics of a lot 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.489
 out anyway I think a lot 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:03.100
 women who want to keep their 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.330
 the time is there so really the 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.340
 solitary is 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.800
 the movement to do to really have 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.780
 a curve and glutes so there we go 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.120
 to be on the moment towards art is in 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.350
 my on ie6 repetition have really 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.970
 loads long enough to stand ready 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.110
 tired of muscu to come lester 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.730
 logically stay there 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.530
 ten bodies in the ventricle the buttocks 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.910
 and then we will go on land 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.880
 I heard as you specified 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.950
 we really have to solicit 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.170
 my glutes in it's a movement 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.579
 of the asin clearly to solicit the 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.229
 glutes also obviously she 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:35.200
 exists only January even see the 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.549
 molars skis the back there certain some 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.159
 present save them money stretched 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.600
 for the pieces there in this case 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.640
 for my part I think we are ready no 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.799
 more on the gluteal part even though there is 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:50.619
 a static isometric work on 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:52.600
 on the bike the loan is tired what is it 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.380
 it can be different solutions 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.119
 today 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.100
 we use is the following a series of 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.110
 six buttons on the mass to his blunders 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.570
 on the analytic motion chained 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.460
 with a series of 10 repetitions on the 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.520
 basic movement 2 minutes 30 of recovery 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.329
 4 to 6 series maximum no need to go 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.979
 look further 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:09.940
 you're going to demo us because there 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.530
 we need a lot of explanations 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.030
 especially to see him lambert goes the 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.239
 seeing the girls is fabulous for them 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.239
 pc 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.510
 composition i'm going to get the weight this 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.239
 that I notice that six 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:35.769
 to go this time so I loved him 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:37.239
 for me I will make my job well I 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.260
 come to this height and when I roll 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.030
 I make boss 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.800
 so we go back down here 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.300
 is not at all safe a job of 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.760
 lombers ie it does not bend 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.130
 the back is just the same 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.890
 basins of extension of the basin that comes 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.080
 push on the hold and necessarily when 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.550
 the movement is constrained it is the back 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.410
 which comes to remedy it is clearly 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.540
 on a big gluteal motion 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.370
 buttocks to the maximum and rest they 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.370
 avenge immediately with the doubled because 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.770
 under the small tips 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.970
 for 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.450
 the only ones that do not necessarily have 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.260
 cages 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.269
 the squat gifts game 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.490
 already under the land we can position 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.060
 of step 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.670
 so tonight 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.400
 Alas 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.769
 precise on the banks heard I give 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.209
 as we lock 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.090
 so very important hands position 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.680
 Thu 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.959
 why the association l'autan six 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.840
 Nations 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:45.760
 and we will alternate people pushed 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.760
 I know this fortunately I am 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.560
 yeah up to 10 repetitions 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.560
 see look it's clearly 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.220
 and then slightly is standing 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.160
 avoid pulling on the benches 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.660
 especially when they go back 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.160
 gluteal pattern 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.950
 and for we get so be careful of step 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.010
 give us 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.140
 Well, no, we're still very happy after 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.440
 break down the bar let loose breath 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.030
 2032 repub tiredness 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.670
 very tired the big gluteus are 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.920
 amplified was much more solicited than 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:26.810
 its ischios a dorsal side that his 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.810
 calves the goal reached this morning 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.170
 I
