00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:06.400
 is a small mistake made and 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:10.900
 Although in the video equal to what I say 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:12.940
 that I can show such a gameplay there 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.610
 i do not say sorry because i play this 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.199
 deleted and not anymore 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.310
 but you can exist too 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:23.380
 Imagine or so welcome people 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.179
 an informative video has been around for a long time 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.859
 Her soap is the last information video 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:28.900
 have uploaded is synonymous does not matter 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:32.110
 right in front you see a solo 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.180
 had gameplay from me with the hit price 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:40.320
 luckily organ got that 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.320
 you again the penis bird ruppin is 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:49.210
 yes what is there to inform here 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.820
 So have noticed how you determined 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.590
 we do as hunger games or hardcore 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.859
 games better said so with the couple 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.690
 has prepared a little special 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:00.670
 and since we are still only at 90 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.170
 have new space in front of us have us 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.720
 Just thought that we few people 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.840
 of you invite as many of you 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.939
 have asked if we are with you 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.799
 can play and now we go 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:12.939
 Just go and now you can 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.100
 also play with us 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:17.470
 you just have to send us a message 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.600
 write on youtube but only if you 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.920
 these requirements fulfilled what 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.990
 which will explain you soon 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.850
 and that is similar to everyone 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.180
 if you will then last with us 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.299
 so to speak, so you alone and three 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.030
 you have to hold in any case 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.590
 logical micro because you have to 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.180
 somehow we will definitely understand something 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.369
 tell and so back and forth and it 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.630
 actually the only requirement for her 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.740
 you also do not have to hold back 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.659
 if now you think that somehow 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.610
 bad shows or just like that 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.810
 We sometimes want to help the people 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.590
 maybe get one 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.750
 So that's why so now like 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.960
 We do not post so no 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.920
 normal where I just so other people 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.590
 do not hold back and that is 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.000
 actually already 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:06.350
 he must not make no money must 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.789
 We really deserve to pay 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.759
 So have fun 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.680
 But he has to be careful that your headset 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.590
 sounds reasonably good because we now 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.019
 have none of it all the time 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.970
 to the exhibition audience that 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.519
 we invite you too, you can of 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.700
 I also record or came up with 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:28.250
 So it should be an acceptable headset 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.560
 its not always out that he 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.569
 actually everything already I know exactly 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.489
 not me probably at the gameplay 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.799
 so the kills just get off that now 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.099
 to currently come to convey I see 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:47.420
 just a bit longer to say that 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:51.110
 or is it so in the last round 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.970
 is the title of hardcore games japanese 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.610
 games 3 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.530
 that's the mcp it usually is the 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.459
 Most notice but for the people 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.470
 who do not know it now 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:05.750
 mcp has from lionsgate i think that was it 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.370
 a copyright infringement get that 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.040
 they should change the name otherwise the 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.930
 the ads and that's why we have 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.970
 now from hunger games the names too 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:18.160
 hardcore games is changed now always 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.160
 still okay because the abbreviation is still ag 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:32.030
 hardcore gamer hardcore games casting too 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.919
 shit on the cock unfamiliar 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.260
 One confuses october with flour 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:37.370
 and so i believe hardcore games can be there 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:44.959
 to think of even better names 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:50.410
 how quite simply no lust plays 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:50.410
 Definitely gamer 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:59.480
 he does not know it's more funny yes 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:03.870
 and we are going to pull ourselves straight 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.790
 actually already as you said you can 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:10.110
 immediately if you see this video the same 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:13.110
 write about youtube to this 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.840
 gina-lisa games hd resp 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.419
 germain hardcore games hd doing that 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:22.410
 now simply reference i'm so 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:23.850
 by simply favoring the ghb 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.280
 to be called but I think the 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.139
 Meanwhile, even the 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.970
 naturalized that some people do not 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:37.560
 know what that means expect me that 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:45.660
 one so I we do all the info 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:47.100
 informations other cards the badges 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.380
 we look like we do that 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.450
 actually random or more we have to 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.790
 So you do not know it yet 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.540
 So you do not have to have one like that 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.800
 write an application 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:00.300
 do not get it wrong but if now 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:02.340
 writes yes name and then either way is 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.080
 hold a little stupid because opponents calm 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.539
 there is nothing to write about it 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.710
 so I guess it is not 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:14.010
 only nine people write what so here 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:16.140
 Well, that's the way it is somehow 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.460
 reasoning is such a small and then 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.380
 we will then take back or 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.340
 several times already on the t it is quite simple 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.870
 then you can too 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.250
 you can not suggest if you 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.490
 because of us we can also with the 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.960
 tears if you want so that's it 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.820
 then, so to speak, that's your wish 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.510
 gameplay with us with us and we will 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.240
 so long 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.500
 well or who will take up with him until we 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.490
 have something good and not that we like that 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.430
 a 2 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:43.520
 yes, yes, we'll see that already 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.520
 uploaded and 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:48.629
 but you must also understand so if 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.590
 for example, you can not get it or something 

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:54.430
 I'm not saying evil or something right now 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:55.120
 But we would be the day we were 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.909
 want to record 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.789
 you have to go for it we have to go for it 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:02.650
 already know in advance say 'yes yeah 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:05.490
 that will be that will then everything regulates that 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:07.930
 widget mailbox 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.310
 but knows what else we can do 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.960
 but we know where we are all the sooner 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:14.189
 had less subscribers 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.539
 this 10 on the server with teamspeak 

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:17.409
 So where it all started we can you 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:19.000
 keep doing it 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:21.129
 that was funny even if they were one 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:26.319
 bit tiring is that is 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:28.180
 really because you can really 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:29.020
 private back that has me too 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:33.240
 getting bigger 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:35.650
 Then we have to look 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.419
 write us message for all the 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:39.099
 do not know how my news because 

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:40.599
 the description there is a link in it 

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:45.550
 Very often you can write us 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:47.529
 automatically a youtube message yes 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:50.139
 I think now you can do that through and 

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:52.810
 from the langsee builder they are more likely 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:57.100
 as what actually 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:57.100
 I would say good yes 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.640
 otherwise you are looking for questions 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.170
 writes in the comments and therefore 

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:08.810
 Again we said everything, I think 

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:20.890
 So until then work and happy hardcore 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:20.890
 games like graduation
