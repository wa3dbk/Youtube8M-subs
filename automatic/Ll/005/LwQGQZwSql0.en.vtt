shin Se allows me to circle and as me to

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.420 
shin Se allows me to circle and as me to
circle<00:00:23.480> and<00:00:23.720> hit<00:00:24.050> and<00:00:24.500> with<00:00:24.950> two<00:00:25.160> hand

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
circle and hit and with two hand

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.520 
circle and hit and with two hand
contacts<00:00:25.850> it<00:00:25.970> for<00:00:26.120> a<00:00:26.150> circle<00:00:26.570> of<00:00:26.660> one<00:00:26.930> I<00:00:27.140> can

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:27.530 
contacts it for a circle of one I can

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.640 
contacts it for a circle of one I can
also<00:00:27.710> strike<00:00:28.220> with<00:00:28.490> the<00:00:28.520> other<00:00:28.760> as<00:00:29.030> well

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
also strike with the other as well

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.290 
also strike with the other as well
striking<00:00:30.650> with<00:00:30.770> the<00:00:30.800> other<00:00:31.070> allows<00:00:31.850> me<00:00:32.119> to

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
striking with the other allows me to

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.140 
striking with the other allows me to
deflect<00:00:33.079> attention<00:00:33.350> from<00:00:33.739> one<00:00:34.040> arm<00:00:34.250> by

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.150 
deflect attention from one arm by

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.180 
deflect attention from one arm by
actually<00:00:35.570> circling<00:00:36.500> and<00:00:36.739> applying<00:00:37.100> pressure

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
actually circling and applying pressure

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.100 
actually circling and applying pressure
on<00:00:37.640> that<00:00:37.940> and<00:00:38.360> in<00:00:38.480> creates<00:00:38.840> an<00:00:38.960> opportunity

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
on that and in creates an opportunity

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:47.160 
on that and in creates an opportunity
for<00:00:39.649> the<00:00:39.770> free<00:00:40.040> arm

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.810 

in<00:00:48.170> my<00:00:48.350> opinion<00:00:48.770> I<00:00:48.830> think<00:00:48.860> ins<00:00:49.310> has<00:00:49.490> a<00:00:49.520> great

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
in my opinion I think ins has a great

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.520 
in my opinion I think ins has a great
self-defense<00:00:50.420> moves<00:00:50.630> a<00:00:50.990> great<00:00:51.260> move<00:00:51.500> for

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
self-defense moves a great move for

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.500 
self-defense moves a great move for
self-defense<00:00:52.250> especially<00:00:53.240> when<00:00:53.390> you're

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
self-defense especially when you're

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.240 
self-defense especially when you're
trying<00:00:53.690> to<00:00:53.870> bridge<00:00:54.170> against<00:00:54.500> an<00:00:54.680> attacker<00:00:55.010> or

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
trying to bridge against an attacker or

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.740 
trying to bridge against an attacker or
a<00:00:55.280> fighter<00:00:55.610> who<00:00:55.820> has<00:00:55.940> a<00:00:55.970> short<00:00:56.330> bridge<00:00:56.540> with

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
a fighter who has a short bridge with

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.680 
a fighter who has a short bridge with
his<00:00:56.900> hands<00:00:57.110> back<00:00:57.380> a<00:00:57.710> reason<00:00:58.580> being<00:00:58.790> is<00:00:59.090> that<00:00:59.360> he

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
his hands back a reason being is that he

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.480 
his hands back a reason being is that he
has<00:00:59.870> his<00:01:00.020> hands<00:01:00.260> back<00:01:00.500> is<00:01:00.740> quite<00:01:00.890> difficult<00:01:01.190> to

to get in a create to stick by hitting
into<00:01:06.229> the<00:01:06.410> arm<00:01:06.590> you<00:01:07.070> can<00:01:07.250> create<00:01:07.520> a<00:01:07.640> situation

where you can slap strike and open up so

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.870 
where you can slap strike and open up so
you<00:01:12.080> can<00:01:12.229> use<00:01:12.380> two<00:01:12.680> hands<00:01:12.979> effectively<00:01:13.700> that's

guy was too strong for me then

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.870 
guy was too strong for me then
effectively<00:02:18.110> I<00:02:18.440> chopped<00:02:18.800> off<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.220> just<00:02:19.430> changed

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
effectively I chopped off I just changed

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.990

the wrist shape from the circle by

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.760 
the wrist shape from the circle by

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
turning the wrist and the elbow out I

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.800 
turning the wrist and the elbow out I
chop<00:02:25.250> straight<00:02:25.580> to<00:02:26.120> a<00:02:26.150> straight<00:02:26.420> line<00:02:26.569> to<00:02:26.780> the

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.670 
chop straight to a straight line to the
throat<00:02:27.970> so<00:02:28.970> it's<00:02:29.090> a<00:02:29.150> great<00:02:29.330> move<00:02:29.569> it's<00:02:30.380> a<00:02:30.470> great

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
throat so it's a great move it's a great

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.309 
throat so it's a great move it's a great
move<00:02:30.920> because<00:02:31.130> Hugh<00:02:31.970> doesn't<00:02:32.180> work<00:02:32.450> I<00:02:32.810> have<00:02:33.290> a

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
move because Hugh doesn't work I have a

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.770 
move because Hugh doesn't work I have a
valid<00:02:33.709> technique<00:02:33.970> whether<00:02:34.970> I<00:02:35.120> change<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.720> a

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
valid technique whether I change to a

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.650 
valid technique whether I change to a
chop<00:02:36.080> or<00:02:36.680> even<00:02:36.920> a<00:02:37.010> jerked<00:02:37.340> because<00:02:38.150> sometimes

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
chop or even a jerked because sometimes

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.210 
chop or even a jerked because sometimes
you<00:02:38.900> get<00:02:39.020> to<00:02:39.170> this<00:02:39.260> situation<00:02:39.440> you<00:02:39.980> try<00:02:40.160> to

you get to this situation you try to

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.670 
you get to this situation you try to
circle<00:02:40.819> that<00:02:40.970> goes<00:02:41.330> too<00:02:41.660> strong<00:02:41.990> for<00:02:42.140> you<00:02:42.260> you

circle that goes too strong for you you

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.949 
circle that goes too strong for you you
can<00:02:42.830> judge<00:02:43.099> then<00:02:43.670> chop<00:02:44.030> so<00:02:44.660> you<00:02:44.750> can<00:02:44.840> now

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
can judge then chop so you can now

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.589 
can judge then chop so you can now
create<00:02:45.170> a<00:02:45.319> situation<00:02:45.560> where<00:02:46.280> you<00:02:47.030> circle

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
create a situation where you circle

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.920 
create a situation where you circle

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
around he's too strong you can chop you

around he's too strong you can chop you

can judge and chop it's really dependent

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.380 
can judge and chop it's really dependent
on<00:02:53.510> what<00:02:53.660> you<00:02:53.810> feel<00:02:54.110> how<00:02:54.680> strong<00:02:55.099> he<00:02:55.400> is<00:02:55.430> where

on what you feel how strong he is where

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.780 
on what you feel how strong he is where
