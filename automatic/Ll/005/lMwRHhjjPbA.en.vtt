00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.130

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.739
 I'm enjoying the story a bit with 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.309
 calmer then I decided to read these 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:39.410
 little ones not to be without video for 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.949

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.080
 I'm a sinner, God, forgive me and it's a 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:48.920
 thing faster I can read the 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:51.440
 book was the man she loves to hate that 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.090

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:04.040
 Any then move see 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:06.920
 story of this is young girl like 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.899
 young man of their adolescence, but they 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.259
 did not stay together as a teenager 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:15.200
 a reason for peace a good guy had a case 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.149
 with the mother of the girl and this case was 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.470
 discovered and the city the whole city 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:24.440
 small and co against the young lady's family 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:30.229
 including the good guy ten years after the 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:33.640
 When did you die and he died? 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:38.119
 he accidentally finds himself on a mountain 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.220
 where there was a little hut where the mother 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:44.240
 of the young lady was with the father of 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.810
 and that's where the little girl went in that cabin 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.530
 collect the personal belongings of the mother 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.420
 while the good guy appeared there only 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.849
 I do not know who is doing nothing then the two 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.630
 with prisoners in the midst of an avalanche 

00:01:55.849 --> 00:02:03.800
 roll on the mountain and they spend the night 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.289
 together sheltered in a place and then obvious 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.050
 Can not get the other one in the head in 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:11.910
 ball all if not 10 year old cooking 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.910
 they do not talk and 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.520
 all the adventures and confusions until 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.430
 they can stay together or forget 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.680
 to win is not the best I've read 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.790
 but it's also not the worst it's cute 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.940
 such an end 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:31.050
 only he thinks he's very fast on the 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:35.270
 story is solved very easily is 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:38.850
 story is too short so it's fast 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:42.390
 quickly everyone gets it's right up 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.880
 the disagreements are fast and finally 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:50.400
 Then I do not even make love. 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:52.980
 do not play oak henrique what 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.110
 he has a blog that used to be 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.780
 called the broom holster and I think that year 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.160
 Last I remember correctly name changed to 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.340
 the love code 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.820
 I'm very fan of the blog. I love the texts. 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.660
 ic I've been reading the many times the 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.270
 texts 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.000
 Who does not know the text? 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:15.540
 about love relationships and if not well 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.490
 funny and a couple of years ago or 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.330
 least the father of the i got sick and 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.720
 discovered that he had an illness 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.120
 degenerative that he was dying to 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.950
 the time has come for the 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.360
 his father's life that his father would not walk 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:33.480
 I was not going to talk and move and that 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.910
 changed the life of ipp's work from his family 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.980
 and also changed the blog texts 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.130
 prices have always been about love 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:44.670
 about the brevity of life about family 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:47.040
 and they have made that personal tone is 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.709
 because I was going to leave it well exposed 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.020
 same situation as his father 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.959
 empathy for everyone that he is 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.930
 innocent or book that is a collection in the 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:00.510
 truth of some blog services 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.960
 It made me upset because I found 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.020
 what are you trying 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:08.320
 doctors and I think only the one with exception 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:12.130
 the last that really unheard of 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:15.190
 I think I had an 8 text only that I did not 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:18.340
 I remembered reading the others all 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:22.780
 I already knew but it did not leave a book 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:25.690
 - sad because I cried again nor 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:29.560
 in the texts the bus is not much 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:33.070
 nice and also cute the project 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.330
 bottle in ic blog for 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.430
 who does not know too 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.100
 whenever he starts a post to 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:42.790
 a song that you can listen to while 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:47.980
 reads and first has the suggestion of the song 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:52.990
 text on mobile 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:58.950
 your name if you have an application on the 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:05:02.710
 sa cell phone passes the player the music plays 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.270
 in spite of the texts in texts that 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.810
 I already read it I still like it 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:10.240
 The very last text broke up with me. 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.580
 I was on the bus from work I cried that 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.110
 not crazy 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.030
 I've kind of cried have to stop because 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.460
 I was getting ashamed of fluoride 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.160
 bus but it's very beautiful I like 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.800
 too much of it more than marginal looks 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.220
 It's funny because some of my 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:30.160
 Preferred blog texts are here 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:32.980

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:40.060

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:42.810
 smiling for those who do not know the blog of 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:47.290
 it is very worth it 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:50.140

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.250

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:19.229

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:22.770

 which are very low performances and 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.669
 legal citizenship but my favorite is 

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:19.830
 of the look 

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:20.880
