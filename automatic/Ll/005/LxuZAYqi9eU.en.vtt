much like this and really nice build
quality<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:23.550> folds<00:00:24.150> up<00:00:24.240> like<00:00:24.510> this<00:00:25.080> very

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980

portable no very nice little cup comfy

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.670 
portable no very nice little cup comfy
and<00:00:32.149> pretty<00:00:33.149> nice<00:00:33.329> build<00:00:33.570> quality<00:00:33.780> but<00:00:34.649> I

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
and pretty nice build quality but I

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.720 
and pretty nice build quality but I
heard<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.920> lot<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.070> stories<00:00:35.370> about<00:00:35.460> people

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
heard a lot of stories about people

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.450 
heard a lot of stories about people
stretching<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.450> too<00:00:36.570> much<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:37.079> snapped

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
stretching it too much and it snapped

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.830 
stretching it too much and it snapped
but<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:39.120> don't<00:00:39.360> think<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.540> will<00:00:39.660> ever<00:00:39.719> happen

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
but I don't think that will ever happen

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.869 
but I don't think that will ever happen
to<00:00:40.079> me<00:00:40.730> well<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:42.829> isolation<00:00:45.980> isolation<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
to me well in isolation isolation the

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.430 
to me well in isolation isolation the
isolation<00:00:48.390> on<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.570> beats<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:49.020> actually

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
isolation on the beats is actually

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.560 
isolation on the beats is actually
really<00:00:49.680> really<00:00:49.890> good<00:00:50.149> when<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.210> put<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.480> on

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
really really good when you put it on

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.860 
really really good when you put it on
you<00:00:51.840> really<00:00:52.320> isolate<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.829> lot<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.129> sound<00:00:53.309> like<00:00:53.489> a

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
you really isolate a lot of sound like a

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.049 
you really isolate a lot of sound like a
lot<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:55.199> mean<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.800> barely<00:00:56.190> hear<00:00:56.460> anything<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:56.879> put

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
lot I mean I barely hear anything I put

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.270 
lot I mean I barely hear anything I put
them<00:00:57.210> on<00:00:57.469> it's<00:00:58.469> really<00:00:58.649> really<00:00:58.829> good<00:00:58.890> it's

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
them on it's really really good it's

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.130 
them on it's really really good it's
even<00:00:59.460> better<00:00:59.609> than<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.879> beach<00:01:00.359> studio<00:01:00.780> that

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
even better than the beach studio that

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.579 
even better than the beach studio that
have<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.410> active<00:01:01.859> in<00:01:02.039> noise<00:01:02.760> cancellation

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
have the active in noise cancellation

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.410 
have the active in noise cancellation
this<00:01:04.589> has<00:01:04.769> passive<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.729> think<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.090> passive

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
this has passive and I think the passive

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.300 
this has passive and I think the passive
here<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.659> better<00:01:06.900> than<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.830> active<00:01:08.130> noise

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
here is better than the active noise

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.120 
here is better than the active noise
cancellation<00:01:08.670> on<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.000> studio<00:01:09.860> the<00:01:10.860> sound

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
cancellation on the studio the sound

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.609 
cancellation on the studio the sound
quality<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.790> really<00:01:12.210> really<00:01:12.750> good<00:01:12.990> truly

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
quality is really really good truly

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.570 
quality is really really good truly
really<00:01:13.830> nice<00:01:14.240> deep<00:01:15.240> bass<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.840> little<00:01:15.900> too<00:01:16.290> much

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
really nice deep bass a little too much

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.390 
really nice deep bass a little too much
it's<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.670> very<00:01:17.939> dominant<00:01:18.799> the<00:01:19.799> midterm<00:01:20.189> highs

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
it's a very dominant the midterm highs

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.980 
it's a very dominant the midterm highs
are<00:01:20.729> okay<00:01:22.100> could<00:01:23.100> be<00:01:23.130> better<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:24.060> know<00:01:24.090> the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
are okay could be better you know the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.109 
are okay could be better you know the
vocals<00:01:25.409> aren't<00:01:25.680> really<00:01:25.890> know<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.430> they're

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
vocals aren't really know you they're

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.350 
vocals aren't really know you they're
not<00:01:27.240> shining<00:01:27.600> like<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.350> should<00:01:28.530> be<00:01:29.180> the<00:01:30.180> base

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
not shining like this should be the base

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.539 
not shining like this should be the base
is<00:01:30.540> good<00:01:30.750> but<00:01:30.930> like<00:01:31.500> i<00:01:31.590> said<00:01:31.619> it's<00:01:32.009> very<00:01:32.280> very

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
is good but like i said it's very very

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.660 
is good but like i said it's very very
strong<00:01:33.119> too<00:01:33.420> strong<00:01:33.450> i<00:01:33.810> think<00:01:34.490> i'm<00:01:35.490> going<00:01:35.610> to

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
strong too strong i think i'm going to

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.990 
strong too strong i think i'm going to
compare<00:01:36.000> them<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:37.100> my<00:01:38.100> skull<00:01:38.460> candy<00:01:38.790> mix

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
compare them to my skull candy mix

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.289 
compare them to my skull candy mix
masters<00:01:40.130> it's<00:01:41.130> about<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.549> same<00:01:41.700> price<00:01:41.909> maybe

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
amazing much better than the other than

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.370 
amazing much better than the other than
the<00:01:54.630> beat<00:01:54.780> studio<00:01:54.990> then<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.530> solos<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:56.790> solos

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
the beat studio then the solos the solos

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.679 
the beat studio then the solos the solos
like<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.619> live<00:01:58.979> incomparable<00:01:59.579> to<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.479> mix

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
like a live incomparable to the mix

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.569 
like a live incomparable to the mix
masters<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.290> mean<00:02:01.439> look<00:02:01.649> these<00:02:01.920> are<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.369> much

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
masters I mean look these are so much

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.860 
masters I mean look these are so much
better<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.170> it's<00:02:04.320> crazy

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
better that it is it's crazy

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.750 
better that it is it's crazy
I<00:02:05.930> wouldn't<00:02:06.620> recommend<00:02:06.920> buying<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.400> solos

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
I wouldn't recommend buying the solos

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.060 
I wouldn't recommend buying the solos
because<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:09.110> sound<00:02:09.320> quality<00:02:09.560> isn't<00:02:09.950> that

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
because the sound quality isn't that
