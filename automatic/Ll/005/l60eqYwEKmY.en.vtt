in the other video let's get a bunch of
videos<00:00:09.929> that<00:00:09.960> infrared<00:00:10.410> photography<00:00:10.620> anyway

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
videos that infrared photography anyway

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.530 
videos that infrared photography anyway
since<00:00:11.639> you<00:00:11.759> everybody<00:00:12.030> keeps<00:00:12.179> hounding<00:00:12.389> me

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
since you everybody keeps hounding me

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.750 
since you everybody keeps hounding me
about<00:00:12.570> it<00:00:15.170> now<00:00:16.170> one<00:00:16.859> of<00:00:16.890> us<00:00:17.039> awesome<00:00:17.490> things

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
about it now one of us awesome things

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.250 
about it now one of us awesome things
and<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.630> don't<00:00:18.750> have<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:18.930> be<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.020> color

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
and you don't have to be a color

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.880 
and you don't have to be a color
correction<00:00:19.800> infrared<00:00:20.250> photography<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:21.029> easy

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
correction infrared photography is easy

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.500 
correction infrared photography is easy
as<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:23.100> told<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.490> can<00:00:23.640> have<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.910> find<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.269> lens

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
as I told you can have to find the lens

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.310 
as I told you can have to find the lens
does<00:00:24.960> not<00:00:25.140> have<00:00:25.470> infrared<00:00:27.170> coating<00:00:28.170> on<00:00:28.289> it

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
does not have infrared coating on it

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.050 
does not have infrared coating on it
because<00:00:28.650> what<00:00:28.920> will<00:00:29.039> happen<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:29.519> people<00:00:29.580> think

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
because what will happen is people think

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.179 
because what will happen is people think
they<00:00:30.240> got<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.390> bad<00:00:30.570> filter<00:00:31.019> let's<00:00:31.769> ring<00:00:31.920> me<00:00:32.070> la

assume you got something with 52 million
in<00:00:54.120> front<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.480> more<00:00:54.750> than<00:00:54.930> one<00:00:55.079> lens

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
in front of it more than one lens

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.000 
in front of it more than one lens
hopefully<00:00:55.800> um<00:00:57.020> he'd<00:00:58.020> be<00:00:58.260> able<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.500> return<00:00:58.800> it

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
hopefully um he'd be able to return it

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
five-year G does it's better to use a

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.080 
five-year G does it's better to use a
nice<00:01:11.070> prime<00:01:11.490> lens<00:01:11.939> um<00:01:13.400> most<00:01:14.400> people<00:01:14.760> shoot<00:01:14.970> in

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
nice prime lens um most people shoot in

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.179

your<00:01:30.540> f<00:01:30.659> two<00:01:30.810> anyway<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.320> point<00:01:31.530> about<00:01:31.740> this

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
your f two anyway the point about this

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.520 
your f two anyway the point about this
video<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.840> color<00:01:33.840> correction<00:01:34.350> is

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
video is is it color correction is

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.590 
video is is it color correction is
always<00:01:35.009> an<00:01:35.189> issue<00:01:35.340> it's<00:01:35.939> not<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.240> much<00:01:36.270> many

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
always an issue it's not that much many

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.260 
always an issue it's not that much many
issue<00:01:36.810> um<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.979> can<00:01:38.100> choose<00:01:38.310> green<00:01:38.640> as<00:01:39.119> your

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
issue um you can choose green as your

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.999 
issue um you can choose green as your
wet<00:01:39.420> belt<00:01:39.689> choose<00:01:40.140> green<00:01:40.409> as<00:01:40.740> your<00:01:40.860> white
