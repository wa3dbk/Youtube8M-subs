00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.910
 I would feel ultra support gentlemen because 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.569

 well here is the part gentlemen the 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.720
 part of the sniper is the part that most 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.150
 it cost me I still remember I still 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.130
 agreement that in this part I lost the 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.560
 control in this part made me want to 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.349

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.510
