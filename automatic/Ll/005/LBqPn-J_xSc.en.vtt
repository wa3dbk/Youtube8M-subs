maybe another time to give or something
up<00:00:42.180> where<00:00:42.870> he's<00:00:43.079> gonna<00:00:43.230> get<00:00:43.379> more<00:00:43.590> powerful

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
up where he's gonna get more powerful

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.500 
up where he's gonna get more powerful
because<00:00:44.250> episodes<00:00:44.820> like<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:44.969> show<00:00:45.300> that

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
because episodes like this show that

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.690 
because episodes like this show that
he's<00:00:45.780> just<00:00:45.809> not<00:00:46.289> ready<00:00:46.320> for<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.100> top<00:00:47.460> tier

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
he's just not ready for that top tier

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.639 
he's just not ready for that top tier
level<00:00:47.879> yet<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.360> my<00:00:48.510> opinion<00:00:48.840> after<00:00:49.500> seeing

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
level yet in my opinion after seeing

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.439 
level yet in my opinion after seeing
this<00:00:49.829> because<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.129> Cordy<00:00:50.489> he's<00:00:51.030> just<00:00:51.270> a

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
this because I Cordy he's just a

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.680 
this because I Cordy he's just a
souped-up<00:00:52.050> pillhead<00:00:52.320> Fishman<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.489> that's<00:00:54.090> my

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
souped-up pillhead Fishman so that's my

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.389 
souped-up pillhead Fishman so that's my
stance<00:00:55.050> on<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.440> after<00:00:55.739> seeing<00:00:55.980> those

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
stance on that after seeing those

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.680 
stance on that after seeing those
particular<00:00:56.699> parts<00:00:57.059> where<00:00:57.180> loopy<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.480> still

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
the shoulder again kind of reminded me

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.450

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
the ship and it kind of looked a little

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.969 
the ship and it kind of looked a little
bit<00:02:02.430> simplistic<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.780> design<00:02:04.469> of<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.770> ship

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
bit simplistic the design of the ship

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.590 
bit simplistic the design of the ship
and<00:02:05.040> when<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.430> looked<00:02:05.610> like<00:02:05.820> very<00:02:06.240> stripped

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
and when I looked like very stripped

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.690

so<00:02:08.970> on<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.989> animation<00:02:10.530> wasn't<00:02:10.800> top-notch<00:02:11.280> in

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
so on the animation wasn't top-notch in

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
starts off slow and then picks up and

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.830 
starts off slow and then picks up and
then<00:03:08.400> takes<00:03:08.670> off<00:03:08.850> it<00:03:09.090> was<00:03:09.210> just<00:03:09.360> like<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:09.810> know
