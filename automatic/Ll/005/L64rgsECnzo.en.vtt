00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.990 

I've<00:00:01.110> always<00:00:01.380> believed<00:00:01.890> that<00:00:02.190> a<00:00:02.399> beautiful

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
I've always believed that a beautiful

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.760 
I've always believed that a beautiful
garden<00:00:03.419> can<00:00:03.629> make<00:00:03.810> a<00:00:03.840> real<00:00:04.140> difference

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:06.770 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.580 

so<00:00:07.430> my<00:00:07.609> team<00:00:07.790> and<00:00:07.850> I<00:00:08.059> are<00:00:08.299> transforming<00:00:09.049> spaces

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:09.590 
so my team and I are transforming spaces

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.039 
so my team and I are transforming spaces
around<00:00:09.769> the<00:00:10.190> country<00:00:10.760> blisteringly<00:00:11.719> hotter

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:12.049 
around the country blisteringly hotter

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:14.170 
around the country blisteringly hotter
that<00:00:12.440> the<00:00:12.860> narrow<00:00:13.129> end<00:00:13.400> of<00:00:13.519> the<00:00:13.639> garden<00:00:14.030> needs

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:14.180 
that the narrow end of the garden needs

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.759 
that the narrow end of the garden needs
a<00:00:14.299> bit<00:00:14.450> of<00:00:14.480> care<00:00:14.809> and<00:00:14.960> attention

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:15.769 
a bit of care and attention

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:17.679 
a bit of care and attention
so<00:00:16.219> David's<00:00:16.610> come<00:00:16.820> up<00:00:16.939> with<00:00:17.240> a<00:00:17.270> novel<00:00:17.509> solution

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:17.689 
so David's come up with a novel solution

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.609 
so David's come up with a novel solution
it<00:00:18.430> Alan<00:00:19.430> Francis<00:00:19.939> I<00:00:20.200> think<00:00:21.200> I've<00:00:21.259> solved<00:00:21.529> the

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
it Alan Francis I think I've solved the

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:23.050 
it Alan Francis I think I've solved the
problem<00:00:21.950> of<00:00:21.980> that<00:00:22.130> lower<00:00:22.369> area<00:00:22.789> have<00:00:22.910> a<00:00:22.939> look

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
problem of that lower area have a look

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.429 
problem of that lower area have a look
at<00:00:23.150> these<00:00:23.240> good<00:00:23.660> heavens

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
at these good heavens

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.700 
at these good heavens
so<00:00:25.039> what's<00:00:25.279> the<00:00:25.460> ice<00:00:26.029> for<00:00:26.480> a<00:00:26.750> focal<00:00:27.260> point<00:00:27.289> down

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
so what's the ice for a focal point down

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.859 
so what's the ice for a focal point down
there<00:00:27.949> yes<00:00:28.160> what<00:00:28.730> do<00:00:28.789> you<00:00:28.849> think<00:00:29.119> I<00:00:29.330> tell<00:00:29.750> you

like<00:01:05.420> a<00:01:05.449> pergola<00:01:06.020> we<00:01:06.470> can<00:01:06.619> train<00:01:06.860> climbers

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
like a pergola we can train climbers

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.310 
like a pergola we can train climbers
over<00:01:07.640> them<00:01:07.790> so<00:01:08.330> they'll<00:01:08.510> blend<00:01:08.780> in<00:01:09.020> with<00:01:09.200> the

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
over them so they'll blend in with the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.899 
over them so they'll blend in with the
rest<00:01:09.350> of<00:01:09.650> the<00:01:09.710> garden<00:01:10.040> can<00:01:10.490> you<00:01:10.610> move<00:01:10.729> the

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
middle one out a bit more that way go

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.289 
middle one out a bit more that way go
left<00:01:15.049> a<00:01:15.200> bit<00:01:15.409> oh<00:01:15.590> I'm<00:01:16.460> rather<00:01:16.640> liking<00:01:17.119> that
