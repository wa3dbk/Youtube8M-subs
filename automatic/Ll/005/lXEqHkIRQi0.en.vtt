depending<00:00:40.699> on<00:00:40.850> how<00:00:41.449> I<00:00:41.480> measure<00:00:41.749> it<00:00:42.019> it's<00:00:42.800> a

00:00:42.849 --> 00:00:42.859 
depending on how I measure it it's a

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:45.360 
depending on how I measure it it's a
little<00:00:42.980> bit<00:00:43.100> larger<00:00:43.489> than<00:00:43.579> a<00:00:43.670> quarter<00:00:44.079> so<00:00:45.079> it's

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
little bit larger than a quarter so it's

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.000 
little bit larger than a quarter so it's
definitely<00:00:46.370> a<00:00:46.870> lot<00:00:47.870> finer<00:00:48.320> and<00:00:48.559> a<00:00:48.589> lot<00:00:48.769> less

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
definitely a lot finer and a lot less

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.910 
definitely a lot finer and a lot less
hair<00:00:49.309> than<00:00:49.659> JJJ<00:00:50.659> and<00:00:50.929> obviously<00:00:51.559> a<00:00:51.679> lot

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
hair than JJJ and obviously a lot

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.750

out with a ponytail in the back of her

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
her neck and I have found that to be

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.740 
her neck and I have found that to be
completely<00:01:52.070> unnecessary<00:01:53.060> with<00:01:53.299> my<00:01:53.479> hair

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
completely unnecessary with my hair

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.090 
completely unnecessary with my hair
because<00:01:53.929> I<00:01:54.049> don't<00:01:54.200> have<00:01:54.289> as<00:01:54.439> much<00:01:54.560> of<00:01:54.619> it<00:01:57.070> so<00:01:58.070> I

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
because I don't have as much of it so I

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.160 
because I don't have as much of it so I
can<00:01:58.340> just<00:01:58.490> hold<00:01:58.729> my<00:01:59.119> ponytail<00:01:59.600> with<00:01:59.780> my<00:01:59.899> hand

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
can just hold my ponytail with my hand

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.289 
can just hold my ponytail with my hand
and<00:02:00.409> then<00:02:01.159> instead<00:02:01.700> of<00:02:01.789> wrapping<00:02:02.119> it<00:02:02.210> around

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
and then instead of wrapping it around

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.349 
and then instead of wrapping it around
my<00:02:02.600> entire<00:02:02.899> hand<00:02:03.380> as<00:02:03.679> I<00:02:03.979> believe<00:02:04.159> she<00:02:04.490> does<00:02:05.030> I

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:05.359 
my entire hand as I believe she does I

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:07.149 
my entire hand as I believe she does I
only<00:02:05.719> have<00:02:05.929> to<00:02:06.049> wrap<00:02:06.200> it<00:02:06.380> around<00:02:06.469> two<00:02:06.770> fingers

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
only have to wrap it around two fingers

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.410 
only have to wrap it around two fingers
because<00:02:07.520> there's<00:02:07.759> just<00:02:07.789> not<00:02:07.999> a<00:02:08.060> whole<00:02:08.149> lot<00:02:08.390> of

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
because there's just not a whole lot of

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.850 
because there's just not a whole lot of
hair<00:02:10.270> so<00:02:11.270> then<00:02:11.420> I<00:02:11.540> and<00:02:11.870> I<00:02:11.960> also<00:02:12.200> only<00:02:12.470> have<00:02:12.710> to

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
hair so then I and I also only have to

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.009 
hair so then I and I also only have to
wrap<00:02:13.010> it<00:02:13.190> around<00:02:13.280> like<00:02:13.519> that<00:02:13.580> one<00:02:14.000> time<00:02:14.239> so

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
wrap it around like that one time so

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.470 
wrap it around like that one time so
that's<00:02:15.739> it<00:02:15.950> and<00:02:16.159> then<00:02:16.670> just<00:02:16.879> pull<00:02:17.150> it<00:02:17.239> through

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
that's it and then just pull it through

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.289 
that's it and then just pull it through
the<00:02:17.629> loop

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
the loop

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.589 
the loop
and<00:02:20.299> then<00:02:20.750> take<00:02:21.079> this<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.500> tuck<00:02:21.920> it<00:02:22.099> under

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
and then take this and tuck it under

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:29.500 
and then take this and tuck it under
right<00:02:23.599> there<00:02:24.640> and<00:02:25.640> I<00:02:27.519> like<00:02:28.519> using<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:29.239> clips

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
right there and I like using the clips

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.839 
right there and I like using the clips
like<00:02:29.750> JJJ<00:02:30.379> does<00:02:30.590> because<00:02:31.040> it's<00:02:31.340> really<00:02:31.640> really

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
like JJJ does because it's really really

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.119 
like JJJ does because it's really really
comfortable<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:33.019> very<00:02:33.319> loose<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:33.890> that's

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
comfortable and very loose and that's

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:35.679 
comfortable and very loose and that's
nice<00:02:34.430> because<00:02:34.549> it<00:02:34.760> doesn't<00:02:35.000> cause<00:02:35.659> any

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:35.689 
nice because it doesn't cause any

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.059 
nice because it doesn't cause any
tension<00:02:36.140> on<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.680> hair

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
tension on the hair

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.009 
tension on the hair
one<00:02:37.879> thing<00:02:38.120> though<00:02:38.299> when<00:02:38.540> you<00:02:38.629> have<00:02:38.780> a<00:02:38.810> lot

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
one thing though when you have a lot

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.920 
one thing though when you have a lot
less<00:02:39.200> hair<00:02:39.579> and<00:02:40.579> a<00:02:40.640> smaller<00:02:40.909> bun<00:02:41.209> is<00:02:41.450> that<00:02:41.629> when

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
less hair and a smaller bun is that when

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.089 
less hair and a smaller bun is that when
you're<00:02:42.049> using<00:02:42.170> Clips<00:02:42.560> you<00:02:42.680> don't<00:02:42.859> want<00:02:42.980> to

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
you're using Clips you don't want to

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.250 
you're using Clips you don't want to
cover<00:02:43.760> up<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.150> entire<00:02:44.269> bun<00:02:44.750> with<00:02:44.900> your<00:02:45.049> clips

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
cover up the entire bun with your clips

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.140 
cover up the entire bun with your clips
which<00:02:45.439> can<00:02:45.950> happen<00:02:46.370> when<00:02:46.519> you<00:02:46.609> have<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:46.939> such

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
which can happen when you have the such

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.869 
which can happen when you have the such
a<00:02:47.180> loop<00:02:47.420> of<00:02:47.629> small<00:02:48.290> amount<00:02:48.560> of<00:02:48.650> hair<00:02:48.829> so<00:02:49.400> do<00:02:49.640> use

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
a loop of small amount of hair so do use

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.740 
a loop of small amount of hair so do use
a<00:02:49.909> clip<00:02:50.359> that's<00:02:50.569> really<00:02:50.870> small<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:51.530> then<00:02:52.750> just

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
a clip that's really small and then just

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.599 
a clip that's really small and then just
grab<00:02:54.139> the<00:02:54.170> edge<00:02:54.470> of<00:02:54.769> the<00:02:54.889> bun<00:02:55.069> with<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.370> clip

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609 
grab the edge of the bun with the clip

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:57.849 
grab the edge of the bun with the clip
and<00:02:55.849> get<00:02:56.450> mostly<00:02:56.930> your<00:02:57.079> scalp<00:02:57.409> hair<00:02:57.620> instead

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
and get mostly your scalp hair instead

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.490 
and get mostly your scalp hair instead
of<00:02:58.209> mostly<00:02:59.209> bun<00:02:59.510> and<00:02:59.720> only<00:02:59.930> a<00:02:59.959> little<00:03:00.170> scalp

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
of mostly bun and only a little scalp

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.240 
of mostly bun and only a little scalp
hair<00:03:00.739> and<00:03:00.980> that<00:03:01.909> will<00:03:02.209> keep<00:03:02.750> you<00:03:02.989> from

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
hair and that will keep you from

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:11.190 
hair and that will keep you from
covering<00:03:04.250> up<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:04.579> pre<00:03:04.760> design<00:03:05.180> of<00:03:05.389> your<00:03:05.420> bun

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.240 
I didn't accidentally cut them they
would<00:04:16.209> all<00:04:16.389> be<00:04:16.419> the<00:04:17.139> length<00:04:17.349> of<00:04:17.530> these<00:04:17.919> outer

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
would all be the length of these outer

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.819 
would all be the length of these outer
pieces<00:04:18.820> here<00:04:19.120> by<00:04:19.419> now<00:04:19.630> and<00:04:20.019> that's<00:04:20.650> right

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829
