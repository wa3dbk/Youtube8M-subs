00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.480 
a few months ago I set out on the rather
ambitious<00:00:03.720> challenge<00:00:03.959> of<00:00:04.770> creating<00:00:05.009> a<00:00:05.279> game

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
ambitious challenge of creating a game

typically<00:00:10.559> in<00:00:10.740> video<00:00:10.980> games<00:00:11.219> you'll<00:00:11.460> have<00:00:11.610> a

and on planet areas and I wanted to see

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.890 
and on planet areas and I wanted to see
if<00:00:17.160> we<00:00:17.279> can<00:00:17.400> get<00:00:17.520> rid<00:00:17.699> of<00:00:17.760> that<00:00:17.850> but<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.630> course

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
if we can get rid of that but of course

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.590 
if we can get rid of that but of course
that's<00:00:19.560> really<00:00:20.220> hard<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.910> way<00:00:21.029> modern<00:00:21.390> video

this<00:00:36.630> in<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.899> number<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.260> ways<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:38.190> most<00:00:38.309> common

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
this in a number of ways the most common

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.479 
this in a number of ways the most common
one<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.270> have<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.450> skybox<00:00:40.170> which<00:00:41.100> renders

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
one is to have a skybox which renders

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.610 
one is to have a skybox which renders
faraway<00:00:42.000> objects<00:00:42.540> at<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.809> much<00:00:43.140> smaller<00:00:43.469> scale

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
faraway objects at a much smaller scale

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.250 
faraway objects at a much smaller scale
and<00:00:44.250> then<00:00:44.399> later<00:00:44.640> renders<00:00:45.120> near<00:00:45.510> objects<00:00:45.989> at<00:00:46.200> a

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
and then later renders near objects at a

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.740 
and then later renders near objects at a
larger<00:00:46.710> scale<00:00:46.739> for<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.399> illusion<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:48.239> lard

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
larger scale for the illusion of lard

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.750 
larger scale for the illusion of lard
award<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.620> trouble<00:00:49.980> with<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.219> method<00:00:50.489> is

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
award the trouble with this method is

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.610 
award the trouble with this method is
that<00:00:50.940> typically<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.449> player<00:00:51.780> can't<00:00:52.199> interact

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
that typically a player can't interact

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.220 
that typically a player can't interact
with<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.070> skybox<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.910> solve<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:54.719> problem<00:00:55.110> by

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
with the skybox I solve this problem by

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.680 
with the skybox I solve this problem by
creating<00:00:55.260> multiple<00:00:55.980> render<00:00:56.610> levels<00:00:57.000> which

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
creating multiple render levels which

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.450 
creating multiple render levels which
phase<00:00:58.020> in<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.469> out<00:00:58.559> depending<00:00:58.770> on<00:00:59.340> the
