00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.710
 the already fresh air is a practice that has 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.200
 as a purpose to create better 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.540
 conditions for an air exchange e 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.450
 water or on the ground improving the 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:34.180
 water penetration and tannery thanks 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.190
 to less soil compaction 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.680
 the lawn in fact if it comes long 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.079
 used the trampled arrives to 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.980
 present a compact surface that 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:46.420
 leads to the degradation of the turf 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.640
 in addition to one can form over one 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.039
 ie felt layer of fabrics 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.829
 decomposed vegetables that give rise to 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:55.989
 to a semi permanent crust within the 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.780
 which can develop molds and 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.850
 diseases to overcome these two 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.129
 problems are usually used 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.430
 machines that act on the ground and on the 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.920
 turf the vertical for example 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.320
 removes the felt grace of knives 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.240
 rotary mounted on a cylinder 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.689
 horizontal and brings it to the surface 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.270
 where it can be easily picked up 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:21.520
 ventilated or scarified instead 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.100
 act on the ground level 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.600
 superficial making incisions a 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.340
 depth between 25 centimeters 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.009
 for a more incisive intervention yes 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.649
 instead they use other equipment that 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.350
 they are called carrots or buca 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.420
 trici and cause a puncture very 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.729
 thick grassy patch also a 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.740
 depth of 30 centimeters 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.590
 usually two types of are used 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.930
 the coring the stellar one provides 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.360
 series of dies mounted on a cylinder 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.810
 horizontal while in the vertical one 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.490
 the same items are pierced 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.789
 perpendicularly extracting the ground 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.979
 the earth cylinders in some cases yes 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.770
 can also use machines of 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:08.380
 soil compactors that work or 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.810
 with free honey or with jets of water 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.960
 high pressure directly into the 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.960
 ground 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.349
 subsequently the land of the 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.480
 perforated compactors can be 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.819
 recharged with other materials in 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.830
 detail with sand that protects the 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.819
 grass collar improving the 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.819
 trampling resistance 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.400
 we recommend using sand 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.010
 silica and not calcareous because 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.630
 the latter would modify the ph 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.520
 of the soil 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.980
 as for the quantities they vary to 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.290
 depending on the function of the lawn after 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.220
 a carrot operation on a field 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.710
 from soccer 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.620
 about 34 liters must be added 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:01.210
 per square meter while it a field from 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.210
 golf at most 11 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.450
 avoid these processes in moments 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.760
 in which the plant could suffer it 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.850
 cutting stress in the middle of summer or 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.340
 winter or when you could favor the 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.470
 germination of pests 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.310
 in general the most suitable period is 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.310
 the beginning of summer
