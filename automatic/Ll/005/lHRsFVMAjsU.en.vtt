00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.650
 many beginning knitters do not 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.680
 knows how to do 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.220
 and children 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.540
 check 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:24.210
 such brushes we are in our master class 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:29.710
 show you how to do it very quickly and easily 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:36.790
 join us now we will do 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:43.989
 tassels for ears I will do two 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:44.470
 the colors of the yarn that I knitted alone 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:56.550
 Colour 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:56.550
 wrapping my palm four times on 1 2 3 4 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:07.360
 I recognize the thread I take the next color and for sure 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:18.150
 also winding 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:18.150
 four times two three four now 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:41.700
 we need to cut the ring in two 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:41.700
 from this side and from this 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:03.990
 now cut long pieces of yarn 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:12.670
 I know how many centimeters 30 probably 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:14.520
 possible less and now we need 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.570
 bandage 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.570
 in the middle of each part 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:01.140
 in the same way we fasten the second part 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:09.690
 we cut off two more pieces 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:13.860
 such small now what we do 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:16.450
 fold in half 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:29.020
 knots where we tied 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:30.040
 inward this way and now to us 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:43.870
 need to dress 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:46.650
 at the base for this, I was cut off exactly 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.650
 also we 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:04.620
 pulling and tying on the knot 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.850
 everything 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.580
 Now we do exactly the same second 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:46.000
 tied up now we cut off dub like 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:50.760
 we need, in principle, this in its own way 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.760
 I just want to trim it to me 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:18.780
 just to be flat here too 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:18.780
 most now take the gun 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:41.840
 now from the wrong side so here 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:44.810
 we drive side by side here we take 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.810
 grab one thread stretch 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.810
 inside 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:58.520
 so now the second second on the other 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:06:07.200
 the sides here are also captured and 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:17.750
 stretched and now we need to tie them 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:17.750
 from the seamy side turn out the front sight here 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:29.560
 and tie on the knot 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:58.340
 the thread is cropped we turn out look what 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:58.340
 we did it perfectly 

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:22.580
 cut off the excess yarn and you can not 

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:28.550
 cut and leave the gun inside exactly 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:31.210
 we also fasten our second fly 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.210
 tassel
