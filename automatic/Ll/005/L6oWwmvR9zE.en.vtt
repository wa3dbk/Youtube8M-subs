00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.960
 Part 1. Undressing the interior 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.980
 Console in carbon 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.440
 Repair of the steering wheel tape 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.040
 Construction of the control panel and cockpit backlight 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.500
 Lighting fixture 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.500
 First attempts 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.054
 fitting 

00:03:20.054 --> 00:03:21.376
 lighting 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.400
 I have switched off the light especially 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.220
 the steering wheel is in front of me 

00:03:31.251 --> 00:03:33.251
 under the steering wheel, pedal lighting 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.300
 and here you can see an open console at the moment 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.180
 some say it's bad, others, no, I do not know 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.320
 I always wanted to have something like that 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.660
 not that in toyota, I just wanted to have something like that in the car 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.060
 Time to collect the toys and take out the trunk 

00:05:11.364 --> 00:05:12.724
 Time to build boxes 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.380
 I did not take a lot of photos with my hands from the resin 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.380
 There was no time, because the resin dried quickly 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.040
 And I've put a million layers
