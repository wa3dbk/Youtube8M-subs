render settings you can see we've got
loads<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.820> stuff<00:01:21.090> there<00:01:21.360> but<00:01:21.530> I'm<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:22.619> going

loads of stuff there but I'm just going
to<00:01:22.890> show<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.250> basics<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.850> just<00:01:24.119> how<00:01:24.240> to

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
to show you the basics of just how to

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.730 
to show you the basics of just how to
get<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.740> mover<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:26.400> load<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.820> YouTube<00:01:27.240> or<00:01:27.740> or

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
get a mover to load to YouTube or or

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.830 
get a mover to load to YouTube or or
whatnot<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.090> first<00:01:30.329> thing<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.720> we're

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
whatnot so the first thing is we're

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.910 
whatnot so the first thing is we're
going<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.020> do<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.380> if<00:01:32.070> we<00:01:32.189> click<00:01:32.430> on<00:01:32.579> save<00:01:33.920> and

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
going to do is if we click on save and

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.160 
going to do is if we click on save and
then<00:01:34.979> we<00:01:35.579> choose<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.329> destination<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:37.140> where

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
then we choose the destination of where

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.550 
then we choose the destination of where
to<00:01:37.470> save<00:01:37.680> if<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.920> will<00:01:38.040> just<00:01:38.189> call<00:01:38.400> this<00:01:39.560> render

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
to save if it will just call this render

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.100 
to save if it will just call this render
test<00:01:42.140> save<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.320> on<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.439> desktop<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:44.899> then<00:01:45.899> on

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
test save it on the desktop and then on

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.100 
test save it on the desktop and then on
the<00:01:46.259> format<00:01:47.210> we're<00:01:48.210> going<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.420> go<00:01:48.869> down<00:01:49.079> to

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
the format we're going to go down to

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:57.620 
the format we're going to go down to
QuickTime<00:01:49.530> mover<00:01:52.040> options<00:01:56.509> animation<00:01:57.509> you

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
QuickTime mover options animation you

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.609 
QuickTime mover options animation you
can<00:01:57.659> choose<00:01:58.430> whichever<00:01:59.869> format<00:02:00.869> best<00:02:01.320> works

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
can choose whichever format best works

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.889 
can choose whichever format best works
for<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.070> I'll<00:02:02.280> usually<00:02:02.520> choose<00:02:03.920> h.264<00:02:04.920> or

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
for you I'll usually choose h.264 or

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:11.660 
for you I'll usually choose h.264 or

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
either one of them is good

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.730 
either one of them is good
we'll<00:02:13.950> choose<00:02:14.130> that<00:02:14.190> for<00:02:14.550> now<00:02:16.730> h.264

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
we'll choose that for now h.264

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.880 
we'll choose that for now h.264
compressor<00:02:20.780> most<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.020> time<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.440> you

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
compressor most of the time you you

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.820 
compressor most of the time you you
always<00:02:23.220> want<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.490> have<00:02:23.610> it<00:02:23.640> up<00:02:23.820> to<00:02:23.970> best<00:02:24.830> and

and then under the preset tab here I'm

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.280 
and then under the preset tab here I'm
going<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.840> go<00:02:36.960> down<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.200> film<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.860> video<00:02:37.980> and

going to go down to film and video and

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.370 
going to go down to film and video and
we<00:02:40.290> get<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.440> bunch<00:02:40.680> of<00:02:40.920> presets<00:02:41.910> here<00:02:42.330> you<00:02:43.230> can

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
we get a bunch of presets here you can

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:50.000 
we get a bunch of presets here you can
either<00:02:43.470> use<00:02:44.930> HD<00:02:45.930> 720p<00:02:46.590> or<00:02:47.270> HD<00:02:48.270> 1080p<00:02:48.840> I'll<00:02:49.230> just

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
either use HD 720p or HD 1080p I'll just

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.880 
either use HD 720p or HD 1080p I'll just
like<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.340> go<00:02:50.490> with<00:02:50.670> 720p<00:02:51.330> because<00:02:51.680> that's<00:02:52.680> what

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
like to go with 720p because that's what

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.110 
like to go with 720p because that's what
all<00:02:53.130> my<00:02:53.550> videos<00:02:53.940> running<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:56.040> then<00:02:56.430> also<00:02:56.700> what

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
all my videos running and then also what

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.540 
all my videos running and then also what
you'd<00:02:57.270> want<00:02:57.300> to<00:02:57.660> do<00:02:57.840> is<00:02:58.080> within<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.250> frame

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
you'd want to do is within the frame

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.960 
you'd want to do is within the frame
range<00:03:00.320> select<00:03:01.320> all<00:03:01.620> frames<00:03:04.430> you<00:03:05.430> can<00:03:05.460> bump<00:03:05.820> the

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
range select all frames you can bump the

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.720 
range select all frames you can bump the
resolution<00:03:06.630> up<00:03:06.750> if<00:03:06.870> you<00:03:07.020> wish<00:03:07.280> but<00:03:08.280> that's<00:03:08.490> up

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
resolution up if you wish but that's up

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.770 
resolution up if you wish but that's up
to<00:03:08.760> you<00:03:10.910> general<00:03:11.910> you<00:03:12.210> want<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.450> make<00:03:12.570> sure

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
to you general you want to make sure

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.410 
to you general you want to make sure
it's<00:03:12.960> on<00:03:13.080> full<00:03:13.440> render<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:16.370> anti-aliasing

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
it's on full render and anti-aliasing

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.760 
it's on full render and anti-aliasing
this<00:03:18.420> is<00:03:18.570> more<00:03:18.780> for<00:03:19.050> if<00:03:19.260> you're<00:03:19.410> dealing<00:03:19.560> with

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
this is more for if you're dealing with

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.040 
this is more for if you're dealing with
reflections<00:03:20.670> so<00:03:21.030> if<00:03:21.480> you're<00:03:21.690> dealing<00:03:21.870> with

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
reflections so if you're dealing with

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.600 
reflections so if you're dealing with
reflections<00:03:22.800> instead<00:03:23.250> of<00:03:23.400> geometry<00:03:25.430> bump<00:03:26.430> it

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
reflections instead of geometry bump it

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.930 
reflections instead of geometry bump it
up<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:26.940> best<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:27.680> then<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:29.340> minimum<00:03:29.640> level

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
up to best and then the minimum level

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.760 
up to best and then the minimum level
one<00:03:30.630> by<00:03:30.780> one<00:03:31.080> maximum<00:03:31.860> level<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:33.270> bolter<00:03:33.810> now

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
one by one maximum level to bolter now

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.680 
one by one maximum level to bolter now
this<00:03:34.980> can<00:03:35.220> be<00:03:35.400> a<00:03:35.430> bit<00:03:35.640> of<00:03:35.760> a<00:03:35.850> render<00:03:36.270> hug

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
this can be a bit of a render hug

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.740 
this can be a bit of a render hug
so<00:03:37.230> if<00:03:37.500> you've<00:03:37.620> got<00:03:37.910> enough<00:03:38.910> powerful<00:03:39.390> machine

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
so if you've got enough powerful machine

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.199 
so if you've got enough powerful machine
to<00:03:39.959> do<00:03:40.140> it<00:03:40.290> then<00:03:40.470> you<00:03:40.620> can<00:03:40.800> bump<00:03:41.010> that<00:03:41.100> up<00:03:41.250> but

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
to do it then you can bump that up but

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.699 
to do it then you can bump that up but
if<00:03:42.330> you're<00:03:42.420> not<00:03:42.600> running<00:03:42.930> a<00:03:43.140> powerful<00:03:43.590> machine

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
if you're not running a powerful machine

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.660 
if you're not running a powerful machine
then<00:03:44.330> one<00:03:45.330> by<00:03:45.540> one<00:03:45.810> or<00:03:46.020> two<00:03:46.080> by<00:03:46.410> twos<00:03:46.740> usually

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
then one by one or two by twos usually

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.470 
then one by one or two by twos usually
what<00:03:47.820> what's<00:03:48.750> good<00:03:48.990> to<00:03:49.140> use<00:03:50.270> and<00:03:51.300> options

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
what what's good to use and options

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.240 
what what's good to use and options
options<00:03:54.480> you<00:03:54.780> don't<00:03:54.959> really<00:03:55.140> need<00:03:55.350> to<00:03:55.410> to<00:03:56.070> play

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
options you don't really need to to play

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.949 
options you don't really need to to play
around<00:03:56.490> if<00:03:56.700> that's<00:03:56.820> a<00:03:57.150> bit<00:03:57.390> more<00:03:57.540> advanced

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
around if that's a bit more advanced

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.490 
around if that's a bit more advanced
stuff<00:03:59.360> so<00:04:00.360> yeah<00:04:00.600> I<00:04:00.630> like<00:04:00.900> to<00:04:00.930> double<00:04:01.170> check

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
stuff so yeah I like to double check

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.449 
stuff so yeah I like to double check
everything<00:04:02.330> everything's<00:04:03.330> raw<00:04:03.660> everything's

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
everything everything's raw everything's

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.680 
everything everything's raw everything's
where<00:04:05.459> it's<00:04:05.670> supposed<00:04:05.820> to<00:04:06.060> be<00:04:06.150> save<00:04:06.420> to

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
where it's supposed to be save to

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.130 
where it's supposed to be save to
because<00:04:07.050> it<00:04:07.440> can<00:04:07.650> be<00:04:07.830> a<00:04:07.860> lengthy<00:04:08.220> process

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
because it can be a lengthy process

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.780 
because it can be a lengthy process
rendering<00:04:10.140> stuff<00:04:10.290> from<00:04:10.590> cinema<00:04:10.920> 4d<00:04:11.160> so<00:04:11.580> I

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
rendering stuff from cinema 4d so I

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.520 
rendering stuff from cinema 4d so I
always<00:04:12.360> like<00:04:12.690> to<00:04:12.720> double<00:04:13.140> check<00:04:13.170> that

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
always like to double check that

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.199 
always like to double check that
everything's<00:04:13.980> in<00:04:14.310> order<00:04:15.150> and<00:04:15.270> ready<00:04:15.450> to<00:04:15.540> go<00:04:15.780> so

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
everything's in order and ready to go so

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.490 
everything's in order and ready to go so
it<00:04:18.209> look<00:04:18.359> like<00:04:18.510> we're<00:04:18.750> all<00:04:18.840> good<00:04:19.080> here

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
it look like we're all good here

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.580 
it look like we're all good here
so<00:04:20.489> for<00:04:20.790> just<00:04:20.940> exit<00:04:21.330> out<00:04:21.419> of<00:04:21.450> that<00:04:21.630> bar<00:04:22.820> and

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
so for just exit out of that bar and

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.550 
so for just exit out of that bar and
then<00:04:25.590> if<00:04:25.830> we<00:04:25.950> click

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
then if we click

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.970 
then if we click
the<00:04:27.250> middle<00:04:27.670> button<00:04:28.260> second<00:04:29.260> from<00:04:29.410> the<00:04:29.440> left

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
the middle button second from the left

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:35.100 
the middle button second from the left
this<00:04:30.130> orange<00:04:31.020> orange<00:04:32.020> tab<00:04:32.260> here<00:04:32.550> and<00:04:34.110> that

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
this orange orange tab here and that

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.510 
this orange orange tab here and that
will<00:04:35.230> bring<00:04:35.410> up<00:04:35.620> the<00:04:35.770> render<00:04:36.130> and<00:04:36.250> it<00:04:36.430> will

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
will bring up the render and it will

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.510 
will bring up the render and it will
start<00:04:36.760> to<00:04:36.910> render<00:04:37.090> and<00:04:37.420> you'll<00:04:37.540> see<00:04:37.780> and<00:04:38.520> you

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
start to render and you'll see and you

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.610 
start to render and you'll see and you
can<00:04:39.700> monitor<00:04:39.910> the<00:04:40.120> render<00:04:41.110> as<00:04:41.260> it's<00:04:41.440> going

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
can monitor the render as it's going

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.490 
can monitor the render as it's going
along<00:04:41.800> frame<00:04:42.340> by<00:04:42.550> frame<00:04:42.580> it<00:04:43.540> can<00:04:43.870> take<00:04:44.170> a<00:04:44.200> while

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
along frame by frame it can take a while

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.770 
along frame by frame it can take a while
depending<00:04:44.530> on<00:04:45.250> the<00:04:45.850> sort<00:04:46.090> of<00:04:46.150> animation<00:04:46.750> that

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
depending on the sort of animation that

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.560 
depending on the sort of animation that
you're<00:04:47.050> doing<00:04:47.700> the<00:04:48.700> speed<00:04:49.060> of<00:04:49.270> your<00:04:49.300> computer

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
you're doing the speed of your computer

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.600 
you're doing the speed of your computer
and<00:04:50.350> all<00:04:50.950> that<00:04:51.130> good<00:04:51.340> stuff<00:04:51.400> so<00:04:52.440> yeah<00:04:53.610> that's

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
and all that good stuff so yeah that's

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.000 
and all that good stuff so yeah that's
pretty<00:04:54.700> much<00:04:54.910> it<00:04:55.180> for<00:04:55.330> today<00:04:55.390> how<00:04:56.380> to<00:04:56.410> render<00:04:56.980> a

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
pretty much it for today how to render a

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.460 
pretty much it for today how to render a
movie<00:04:57.400> out<00:04:57.520> cinema<00:04:57.940> 4d<00:04:58.150> don't<00:04:59.050> forget<00:04:59.290> to
