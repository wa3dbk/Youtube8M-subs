00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
doing it now we'll start with the the

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.059 
doing it now we'll start with the the
layout<00:02:21.510> of<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.930> thing<00:02:22.170> I<00:02:22.319> do<00:02:22.440> like<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.800> layout

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
layout of the thing I do like the layout

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.460 
layout of the thing I do like the layout
of<00:02:23.220> this<00:02:23.490> better<00:02:24.450> than<00:02:24.630> this<00:02:24.810> because<00:02:25.290> if<00:02:25.380> you

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
of this better than this because if you

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.980 
of this better than this because if you
look<00:02:25.590> at<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.740> size<00:02:25.950> of<00:02:26.100> my<00:02:26.190> hand<00:02:26.630> next<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:27.810> this

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
look at the size of my hand next to this

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.130 
look at the size of my hand next to this
it's<00:02:28.890> too<00:02:29.100> small<00:02:29.400> now<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:30.239> original<00:02:30.450> xbox

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
it's too small now the original xbox

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.199 
it's too small now the original xbox
controller<00:02:31.560> was<00:02:32.250> like<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:32.459> VCR<00:02:33.060> remote

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
controller was like a VCR remote

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.140 
controller was like a VCR remote
it<00:02:33.540> was<00:02:33.630> ridiculously<00:02:34.290> huge<00:02:34.680> but<00:02:35.430> i<00:02:35.610> like<00:02:35.850> how

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
it was ridiculously huge but i like how

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.650 
it was ridiculously huge but i like how
on<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:37.010> xbox<00:02:38.010> one<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.640> thumbsticks<00:02:39.270> aren't

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
on the xbox one the thumbsticks aren't

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.640 
on the xbox one the thumbsticks aren't
together<00:02:40.940> because<00:02:41.940> more<00:02:42.450> often<00:02:42.600> than<00:02:42.780> not<00:02:42.900> you

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
together because more often than not you

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.320 
together because more often than not you
use<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.069> thumbsticks<00:02:44.520> more<00:02:44.700> than<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:44.910> d-pad

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
use the thumbsticks more than the d-pad

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.780 
use the thumbsticks more than the d-pad
in<00:02:45.600> video<00:02:45.900> games<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.500> it<00:02:46.650> just<00:02:46.860> feels<00:02:47.100> it<00:02:47.580> just

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
in video games and it just feels it just

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.850 
in video games and it just feels it just
feels<00:02:48.000> better<00:02:48.330> to<00:02:48.630> have<00:02:48.780> one<00:02:48.840> up<00:02:49.260> here<00:02:49.500> than<00:02:49.769> it

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
feels better to have one up here than it

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.120 
feels better to have one up here than it
does<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:50.130> have<00:02:50.250> them<00:02:50.340> side<00:02:50.519> by<00:02:50.550> side<00:02:51.739> but<00:02:52.739> the

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
does to have them side by side but the

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.570 
does to have them side by side but the
movement<00:02:53.400> of<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.820> thumbsticks<00:02:54.480> however

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
movement of the thumbsticks however

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.479 
movement of the thumbsticks however
playstation<00:02:56.580> 3<00:02:56.820> is<00:02:57.060> definitely<00:02:57.450> better<00:02:58.310> but<00:02:59.310> i

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
playstation 3 is definitely better but i

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.000 
playstation 3 is definitely better but i
like<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.060> grip<00:03:00.390> like<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.140> indent<00:03:01.560> hear<00:03:01.800> that

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
like the grip like the indent hear that

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.430 
like the grip like the indent hear that
you<00:03:02.069> have<00:03:02.280> be<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:03.060> thumbstick<00:03:03.690> that<00:03:04.260> where

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
you have be the thumbstick that where

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.190 
you have be the thumbstick that where
this<00:03:04.590> one<00:03:04.830> is<00:03:05.040> just<00:03:05.069> like<00:03:05.459> a<00:03:05.489> mushroom<00:03:06.050> kind<00:03:07.050> of

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
this one is just like a mushroom kind of

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.340 
this one is just like a mushroom kind of
thing<00:03:07.550> so<00:03:08.550> now<00:03:09.330> who<00:03:09.959> would<00:03:10.140> win<00:03:10.319> the

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
thing so now who would win the

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.080 
thing so now who would win the
thumbstick<00:03:10.950> battle<00:03:11.340> I<00:03:11.489> would<00:03:11.700> say<00:03:11.880> it's<00:03:12.000> a

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
thumbstick battle I would say it's a

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.940 
thumbstick battle I would say it's a
draw<00:03:12.360> they're<00:03:12.660> both<00:03:12.810> equally<00:03:13.290> good<00:03:13.500> it's<00:03:13.769> just

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
draw they're both equally good it's just

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.350 
draw they're both equally good it's just
the<00:03:14.100> layout<00:03:14.280> that<00:03:14.610> would<00:03:14.790> be<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.060> biggest

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
the layout that would be the biggest

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.110 
the layout that would be the biggest
problem<00:03:15.750> for<00:03:16.560> most<00:03:16.709> people<00:03:17.160> well<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.730> biggest

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
problem for most people well the biggest

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.090

game<00:03:32.400> i<00:03:32.430> really<00:03:32.760> had<00:03:32.850> problems<00:03:33.150> with<00:03:33.239> fallout

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
game i really had problems with fallout

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.500 
game i really had problems with fallout
was<00:03:33.930> was<00:03:34.530> trying<00:03:34.829> to<00:03:34.920> push<00:03:35.160> down<00:03:35.910> and<00:03:36.120> right<00:03:36.360> or

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
was was trying to push down and right or

up and right or up and left and so forth

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.280 
up and right or up and left and so forth
so<00:03:38.310> on<00:03:38.430> but<00:03:39.030> definitely<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:39.630> d-pad<00:03:39.959> is<00:03:39.989> better

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
so on but definitely the d-pad is better

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.660 
so on but definitely the d-pad is better
on<00:03:40.410> this<00:03:40.500> but<00:03:40.680> I've<00:03:40.860> got<00:03:41.010> a<00:03:41.040> new<00:03:41.130> controller

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
on this but I've got a new controller

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.620 
on this but I've got a new controller
for<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.620> for<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.650> 360<00:03:44.250> with<00:03:44.489> a<00:03:44.519> better<00:03:45.120> d-pad

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
for the for the 360 with a better d-pad

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.509 
for the for the 360 with a better d-pad
I<00:03:45.840> haven't<00:03:46.140> got<00:03:46.260> one<00:03:46.380> of<00:03:46.500> them<00:03:46.590> nor<00:03:47.040> I<00:03:47.310> probably

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
I haven't got one of them nor I probably

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.580 
I haven't got one of them nor I probably
won't<00:03:47.730> either<00:03:47.910> I<00:03:48.450> have<00:03:48.600> like<00:03:48.780> seven<00:03:49.170> threes<00:03:49.410> is

won't either I have like seven threes is
two<00:03:49.739> controllers<00:03:50.130> um<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:51.870> buttons<00:03:52.350> they're

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
two controllers um the buttons they're

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.090 
two controllers um the buttons they're
all<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.310> same<00:03:53.340> I<00:03:53.850> must<00:03:54.450> say<00:03:54.870> these<00:03:55.650> are<00:03:55.680> more

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
all the same I must say these are more

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.300 
all the same I must say these are more
flat<00:03:56.549> and<00:03:56.790> these<00:03:57.120> are<00:03:57.359> more<00:03:57.510> rounded<00:03:58.170> which<00:03:58.829> on

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
flat and these are more rounded which on

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.449 
flat and these are more rounded which on
this<00:04:00.269> one<00:04:00.660> on<00:04:00.930> 360<00:04:01.620> I've<00:04:01.709> had<00:04:01.890> problems<00:04:02.100> with

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
this one on 360 I've had problems with

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.280 
this one on 360 I've had problems with
the<00:04:02.609> button<00:04:02.880> jamming<00:04:03.420> and<00:04:03.540> not<00:04:03.690> working<00:04:04.109> this

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
the button jamming and not working this

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.569 
the button jamming and not working this
one<00:04:04.500> I<00:04:04.530> haven't<00:04:04.890> had<00:04:04.950> that<00:04:05.010> problem<00:04:05.280> like<00:04:05.400> I've

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
one I haven't had that problem like I've

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.400 
one I haven't had that problem like I've
played<00:04:05.850> playstation<00:04:06.120> 2<00:04:06.690> and<00:04:06.900> they're

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
played playstation 2 and they're

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.990 
played playstation 2 and they're
essentially<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:07.950> exact<00:04:08.340> same<00:04:08.519> controller

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
essentially the exact same controller

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.420 
essentially the exact same controller
but<00:04:09.959> I've<00:04:10.079> also<00:04:10.350> had<00:04:10.680> that<00:04:10.890> problem<00:04:11.160> with

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
but I've also had that problem with

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.400 
but I've also had that problem with
PlayStation<00:04:12.030> kun<00:04:12.239> 2<00:04:12.570> controllers<00:04:12.989> now<00:04:13.230> I

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
PlayStation kun 2 controllers now I

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.340 
PlayStation kun 2 controllers now I
don't<00:04:13.709> play<00:04:13.950> this<00:04:14.609> as<00:04:14.970> much<00:04:15.299> as<00:04:15.329> this<00:04:15.720> so<00:04:16.140> maybe

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
don't play this as much as this so maybe

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.170 
don't play this as much as this so maybe
that's<00:04:16.709> why<00:04:16.950> it<00:04:17.010> made<00:04:17.340> it<00:04:17.519> probably<00:04:17.850> happens

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
that's why it made it probably happens

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.500 
that's why it made it probably happens
but<00:04:18.900> as<00:04:19.859> far<00:04:20.100> as<00:04:20.160> are<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:20.640> button<00:04:20.940> layouts

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.900 

they're<00:04:24.510> the<00:04:24.630> same<00:04:24.840> they<00:04:25.200> really<00:04:25.409> are<00:04:25.530> the

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
they're the same they really are the

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.760 
they're the same they really are the
the<00:04:25.970> thing<00:04:26.210> that<00:04:26.390> the<00:04:26.630> Xbox<00:04:27.020> would<00:04:27.230> win<00:04:27.410> for<00:04:27.590> me

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
the thing that the Xbox would win for me

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.730 
the thing that the Xbox would win for me
is<00:04:28.040> that<00:04:28.280> as<00:04:28.430> a<00:04:28.610> B<00:04:28.880> and<00:04:29.030> X<00:04:29.180> Y<00:04:29.450> instead<00:04:29.810> of<00:04:29.900> square

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
is that as a B and X Y instead of square

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.200 
is that as a B and X Y instead of square
and<00:04:31.100> all<00:04:31.280> that<00:04:31.400> kind<00:04:31.640> of<00:04:31.670> stuff<00:04:31.730> don't<00:04:32.120> know

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
and all that kind of stuff don't know

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.150 
and all that kind of stuff don't know
why<00:04:32.510> this<00:04:32.570> is<00:04:32.870> me<00:04:33.320> being<00:04:33.350> a<00:04:33.680> bitch<00:04:33.860> but<00:04:34.010> that

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
why this is me being a bitch but that

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.730 
why this is me being a bitch but that
doesn't<00:04:34.490> really<00:04:34.580> count<00:04:34.750> so<00:04:35.750> um<00:04:36.430> you<00:04:37.430> know<00:04:37.580> ah

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
doesn't really count so um you know ah

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.860 
doesn't really count so um you know ah
another<00:04:39.740> advantage<00:04:39.890> on<00:04:40.460> the<00:04:40.520> xbox<00:04:41.510> controller

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
another advantage on the xbox controller

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.210 
another advantage on the xbox controller
i<00:04:41.990> think<00:04:42.230> is<00:04:42.350> having<00:04:42.530> that<00:04:42.800> thing<00:04:42.980> at<00:04:43.130> the

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
i think is having that thing at the

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.010 
i think is having that thing at the
bottom<00:04:43.580> where<00:04:44.210> you<00:04:44.330> can<00:04:44.480> plug<00:04:44.660> the<00:04:44.840> microphone

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
bottom where you can plug the microphone

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.740 
bottom where you can plug the microphone
into<00:04:45.560> instead<00:04:46.460> of<00:04:46.550> using<00:04:46.880> bluetooth<00:04:47.480> or

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
into instead of using bluetooth or

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.470 
into instead of using bluetooth or
plugging<00:04:48.410> it<00:04:48.530> in<00:04:48.650> directly<00:04:49.130> to<00:04:49.280> the

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
plugging it in directly to the

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.640 
plugging it in directly to the
playstation<00:04:50.480> 3<00:04:50.690> again<00:04:51.020> that's<00:04:51.230> personal

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
playstation 3 again that's personal

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.410 
playstation 3 again that's personal
choice<00:04:51.860> but<00:04:52.130> i<00:04:52.190> prefer<00:04:52.490> to<00:04:52.550> have<00:04:52.760> it<00:04:52.790> plugged

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
choice but i prefer to have it plugged

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.080 
choice but i prefer to have it plugged
in<00:04:53.890> and<00:04:54.890> also<00:04:55.220> you<00:04:55.400> can<00:04:55.550> play<00:04:55.730> your<00:04:55.880> chat

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
in and also you can play your chat

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.760 
in and also you can play your chat
padding<00:04:56.450> which<00:04:56.630> makes<00:04:56.870> more<00:04:57.110> sense<00:04:57.350> having<00:04:57.560> it

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
padding which makes more sense having it

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.860 
padding which makes more sense having it
there<00:04:57.800> than<00:04:58.220> it<00:04:58.310> does<00:04:58.490> up<00:04:58.730> here<00:04:58.760> but<00:04:59.570> again

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
there than it does up here but again

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.300 
there than it does up here but again
that's<00:05:00.200> just<00:05:00.320> personal<00:05:00.560> preference<00:05:00.980> is

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
that's just personal preference is

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.320

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
really nothing better or worse um the

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.630 
really nothing better or worse um the

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
that is six axis which is pretty cool

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.630 
that is six axis which is pretty cool
let's<00:05:30.290> really<00:05:30.560> not<00:05:30.740> use<00:05:30.920> that<00:05:30.950> often<00:05:31.430> and<00:05:31.520> when

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 
let's really not use that often and when

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.130 
let's really not use that often and when
it<00:05:31.760> is<00:05:31.850> use<00:05:32.120> it's<00:05:32.330> kind<00:05:32.510> of<00:05:32.570> annoying<00:05:32.810> because

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 
it is use it's kind of annoying because

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.630 
it is use it's kind of annoying because
it'll<00:05:33.440> be<00:05:33.530> a<00:05:33.560> quick<00:05:33.770> time<00:05:33.980> a<00:05:34.010> bit<00:05:34.220> and<00:05:34.400> quickly

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:34.640 
it'll be a quick time a bit and quickly

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.700 
it'll be a quick time a bit and quickly
you'll<00:05:34.850> have<00:05:34.940> to<00:05:35.060> go<00:05:35.180> like<00:05:35.480> that<00:05:35.750> but<00:05:36.560> you<00:05:36.650> know

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
you'll have to go like that but you know

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.410 
you'll have to go like that but you know
if<00:05:36.800> the<00:05:36.860> games<00:05:37.040> like<00:05:37.280> heavy<00:05:37.490> rain<00:05:37.760> does<00:05:38.150> work

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:38.420 
if the games like heavy rain does work

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.170 
if the games like heavy rain does work
brilliantly<00:05:38.990> well<00:05:39.410> it's<00:05:39.980> rechargeable<00:05:40.820> which

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
brilliantly well it's rechargeable which

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.870 
brilliantly well it's rechargeable which
is<00:05:41.900> huge<00:05:42.290> if<00:05:42.770> under<00:05:43.010> the<00:05:43.130> xbox<00:05:43.460> 360

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
is huge if under the xbox 360

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.580 
is huge if under the xbox 360
could<00:05:44.090> do<00:05:44.210> that<00:05:44.360> because<00:05:44.630> then<00:05:45.320> you<00:05:45.440> wouldn't

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
could do that because then you wouldn't

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.080 
could do that because then you wouldn't
have<00:05:45.680> to<00:05:45.800> have<00:05:45.980> a<00:05:46.010> rechargeable<00:05:46.550> battery<00:05:46.580> pack

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
have to have a rechargeable battery pack

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.730 
have to have a rechargeable battery pack
on<00:05:47.300> it<00:05:47.450> if<00:05:47.570> you<00:05:47.690> don't<00:05:47.930> know<00:05:48.140> then<00:05:48.440> they<00:05:48.530> run<00:05:48.710> on

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
on it if you don't know then they run on

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.530 
on it if you don't know then they run on
double-a<00:05:49.190> batteries<00:05:49.930> as<00:05:50.930> you<00:05:51.080> can<00:05:51.200> see<00:05:51.380> there

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:52.540 
double-a batteries as you can see there

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.000 
double-a batteries as you can see there
so<00:05:53.540> that's<00:05:53.720> the<00:05:53.840> profits<00:05:54.169> probably<00:05:54.470> the<00:05:54.590> xbox

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.010 
so that's the profits probably the xbox

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:58.180 
so that's the profits probably the xbox
controllers<00:05:55.700> biggest<00:05:56.030> downfall<00:05:56.830> is<00:05:57.830> the

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
controllers biggest downfall is the

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.159 
controllers biggest downfall is the
battery<00:05:58.700> battery<00:05:59.330> is<00:05:59.630> really<00:05:59.840> annoying

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:00.169 
battery battery is really annoying

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:02.110 
battery battery is really annoying
because<00:06:00.380> it's<00:06:00.950> really<00:06:01.280> heavy<00:06:01.640> not<00:06:01.970> that<00:06:02.060> I

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
because it's really heavy not that I

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.159 
because it's really heavy not that I
have<00:06:02.240> a<00:06:02.300> problem<00:06:02.630> with<00:06:02.750> that<00:06:02.780> cause<00:06:03.050> I<00:06:03.110> do

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:03.169 
have a problem with that cause I do

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:05.170 
have a problem with that cause I do
prefer<00:06:03.410> it<00:06:03.740> heavier<00:06:04.010> and<00:06:04.220> bigger<00:06:04.340> than<00:06:04.700> this

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
prefer it heavier and bigger than this

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.350 
prefer it heavier and bigger than this
one<00:06:05.450> which<00:06:05.720> is<00:06:05.750> small<00:06:06.440> and<00:06:06.620> light<00:06:07.150> but<00:06:08.150> if<00:06:08.270> you

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
one which is small and light but if you

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.600 
one which is small and light but if you
like<00:06:08.510> a<00:06:08.540> little<00:06:08.840> kid<00:06:09.050> or<00:06:09.169> whatever<00:06:09.320> then<00:06:09.800> this

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
like a little kid or whatever then this

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.240 
like a little kid or whatever then this
is<00:06:10.760> pretty<00:06:10.940> heavy<00:06:11.230> compared<00:06:12.230> to<00:06:12.350> that<00:06:12.500> because

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
is pretty heavy compared to that because

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:14.500 
is pretty heavy compared to that because
of<00:06:13.400> the<00:06:13.430> battery<00:06:13.760> pack<00:06:13.790> so<00:06:14.090> if<00:06:14.150> you<00:06:14.240> take<00:06:14.390> the

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:14.510 
of the battery pack so if you take the

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.310 
of the battery pack so if you take the
battery<00:06:14.750> pack<00:06:14.780> out<00:06:15.110> slide<00:06:15.530> the<00:06:15.640> battery<00:06:16.640> pack

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320 
battery pack out slide the battery pack

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.360 
battery pack out slide the battery pack
makes<00:06:18.320> it<00:06:18.500> pretty<00:06:18.620> heavy<00:06:18.890> which<00:06:19.160> I<00:06:19.310> don't

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:19.370 
makes it pretty heavy which I don't

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.340 
makes it pretty heavy which I don't
really<00:06:19.730> care<00:06:20.060> but<00:06:20.300> you<00:06:20.450> know<00:06:20.510> some<00:06:21.080> people

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:21.350 
really care but you know some people

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.280 
really care but you know some people
probably<00:06:21.440> do<00:06:22.120> now<00:06:23.120> we'll<00:06:23.870> get<00:06:23.990> on<00:06:24.140> to<00:06:24.169> the

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:24.290 
probably do now we'll get on to the

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.170 
probably do now we'll get on to the
PlayStation<00:06:24.890> 3's<00:06:25.070> biggest<00:06:25.430> downfall<00:06:25.850> is<00:06:26.030> the

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 
PlayStation 3's biggest downfall is the

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.700 
PlayStation 3's biggest downfall is the
triggers<00:06:26.540> the<00:06:26.690> triggers<00:06:27.020> on<00:06:27.140> this<00:06:27.320> just

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 
triggers the triggers on this just

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.440 
triggers the triggers on this just
horrible<00:06:28.100> there's<00:06:28.460> really<00:06:28.640> no<00:06:28.850> way<00:06:28.880> around<00:06:29.030> it

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:29.450 
horrible there's really no way around it

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.540 
horrible there's really no way around it
they're<00:06:29.630> just<00:06:29.810> too<00:06:30.440> touchy<00:06:30.740> too<00:06:31.160> sensitive

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
they're just too touchy too sensitive

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.400 
they're just too touchy too sensitive
like<00:06:31.820> I<00:06:31.940> play<00:06:32.150> uncharted<00:06:32.690> 2<00:06:32.810> and<00:06:33.020> I<00:06:33.080> hold<00:06:33.290> it

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:33.410 
like I play uncharted 2 and I hold it

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.260 
like I play uncharted 2 and I hold it
like<00:06:33.560> this<00:06:33.590> and<00:06:34.039> then<00:06:34.669> all<00:06:34.820> of<00:06:34.850> a<00:06:34.910> sudden<00:06:34.940> I'll

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.270 
like this and then all of a sudden I'll

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.300 
like this and then all of a sudden I'll
throw<00:06:35.450> grenades<00:06:35.810> at<00:06:35.930> myself

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310 
throw grenades at myself

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.310 
throw grenades at myself
because<00:06:36.430> I<00:06:36.490> accidentally<00:06:37.000> went<00:06:37.870> a<00:06:37.990> little<00:06:38.140> bit

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:38.320 
because I accidentally went a little bit

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.320 
because I accidentally went a little bit
and<00:06:38.470> slightly<00:06:38.860> pushed<00:06:39.280> it<00:06:39.460> and<00:06:39.610> then<00:06:40.120> if

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 
and slightly pushed it and then if

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:41.790 
and slightly pushed it and then if
you're<00:06:40.570> like<00:06:40.810> on<00:06:41.020> the<00:06:41.110> way<00:06:41.260> owns<00:06:41.410> or<00:06:41.530> something

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 
the controller down for some reason it

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.810 
the controller down for some reason it
hits<00:06:46.870> one<00:06:47.080> of<00:06:47.110> these<00:06:47.350> and<00:06:47.590> it<00:06:47.680> goes<00:06:48.220> backwards

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:48.820 
hits one of these and it goes backwards

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.400

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:11.590 
about the xbox 360 controller for me is

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:14.570 
about the xbox 360 controller for me is
the<00:07:11.620> size<00:07:12.060> the<00:07:13.060> way<00:07:13.240> that<00:07:13.420> it<00:07:13.510> fits<00:07:13.750> one's<00:07:14.020> hand

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:14.580
