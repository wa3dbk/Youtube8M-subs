00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
it's because I remember growing up and I

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.080 
it's because I remember growing up and I
held<00:03:27.549> a<00:03:27.640> lot<00:03:27.819> of<00:03:27.849> things<00:03:28.269> in<00:03:29.730> so<00:03:30.730> I<00:03:30.790> was<00:03:30.940> going

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.699 
to a lot of different things at school
and<00:03:33.450> even<00:03:34.450> though<00:03:34.659> I<00:03:34.690> know<00:03:34.989> I<00:03:35.170> was<00:03:35.379> wearing<00:03:35.530> it

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
and even though I know I was wearing it

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.720 
and even though I know I was wearing it
on<00:03:35.859> my<00:03:35.980> face<00:03:36.250> and<00:03:36.670> I<00:03:37.390> wasn't<00:03:37.989> as<00:03:38.280> social<00:03:39.280> as<00:03:39.519> I

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
on my face and I wasn't as social as I

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.819 
on my face and I wasn't as social as I
should<00:03:39.970> have<00:03:40.000> been<00:03:40.239> none<00:03:41.019> of<00:03:41.170> my<00:03:41.349> teachers

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829

actually asked me what was going on I

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.000 
actually asked me what was going on I
think<00:03:46.329> the<00:03:46.389> biggest<00:03:46.599> obstacle<00:03:47.019> I<00:03:47.680> had<00:03:47.859> to

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
think the biggest obstacle I had to

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.229 
think the biggest obstacle I had to
overcome<00:03:48.190> is<00:03:48.430> that<00:03:48.549> I<00:03:48.700> have<00:03:48.940> a<00:03:48.970> speech

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
overcome is that I have a speech

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.170 
overcome is that I have a speech
impairment<00:03:49.569> when<00:03:50.410> I<00:03:50.500> was<00:03:50.680> in<00:03:50.889> fourth<00:03:51.880> or<00:03:52.000> fifth

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
of energy but I realized that in order

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.250 
of energy but I realized that in order
for<00:03:57.849> me<00:03:58.030> to<00:03:58.060> get<00:03:58.209> my<00:03:58.299> message<00:03:58.480> out<00:03:58.690> I'm<00:03:58.959> going
