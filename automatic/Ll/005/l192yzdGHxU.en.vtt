00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.820
 first to speak and mauro césar pereio pai speaks about soccer in the 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.489
 queen land 

00:00:09.489 --> 00:00:12.459
 the English Premier League clubs to negotiate together 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:17.460
 of the collected 50% is divided in equal parts by the other half according to the 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.759
 agency of each 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:23.059
 to just over two years was closed the last of the rights contracts contracts 

00:00:23.059 --> 00:00:25.839
 broadcast for the premier league games 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:29.989
 you should be gambling 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:33.620
 I think it's for example got the right to broadcast 115 matches 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.670
 by championship 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.140
 paying the equivalent only if she 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.890
 one million thousand thousand reais 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.100
 this amount of games equals just over 40% of the games that the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.590
 television channels to acquire by each Brazilian citizen at least until 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:48.650
 millions 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.550
 in the last negotiation the clubs of the first division of england 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.350
 an increase of approximately 840 million reais 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.810
 previous contract 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:04.559
 another operator paid for just 23 games something close to 400 and 30 million 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.280
 of real 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.100
 well more than you pay for 380 series air games here in Brazil 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.010
 already the bbc to hold the summaries of departures for about 530 million 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.560
 real 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.640
 because the more than the stipulated amount a minimum bid 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.080
 by the Brazilian championship from 2002 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.770
 such amounts do not include the right to for international 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.770
 are negotiated individually with each of the countries 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.770
 with the operators, that is to say a very rich richest league in the world 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.030
 distributes the money and looks like a proportionate form according to the size of the 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.690
 teams but the team is in the second division of ti between the types that goes 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.160
 with the awarding of the league, you can earn a lot more 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.040
 lives with another reality because there is a very reasonable division vcp in my 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.400
 pocket 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.750
 ronaldo and now we go with paulo calçade to talk about the type 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.230
 Spanish 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.840
 in spain barcelona and real madrid are not even there for the league do not want nor 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.290
 know how to trade separately 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:13.280
 that is why the distance difference between these two powers the other 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.869
 increases every season 

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:17.719
 unlike england 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:21.689
 they do not understand that there would be a condominium where everyone can win 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.650
 where we all need to win 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.959
 to have 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.709
 to form a friend 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:28.450
 strong 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.260
 of the strong league the sportif club of powers also 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:38.689
 the Spaniards do not think about it each one care their rights of television the 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:39.679
 small 

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:42.839
 take to sell the small sell 

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:48.069
 and the big ones swimming in cash that's why it's a leader of two prosthetics 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:49.439
 two clubs 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:51.059
 and this does not work 

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:56.339
 this only works for the architecture of the abyss an abyss that seems to have arrived 

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:59.339
 also to Brazilian football 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.930
 and in italy legal how it works 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.379
 in this area changed to this season until then it was season on behalf of the 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:10.710
 personal liberties discussed 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.460
 individually also near the end of this year and highlights the fact that 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.199
 an abyss of age is between the parties 

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:20.199
 then by intervention of the ministry of the island's ports in the state 

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:24.989
 antitrust authorities north of italy the right began to be used 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.420
 collectively 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.920
 the friends aline alleges to the separated catho in serious refers to see 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.799
 last week his exit sportively possible to brake 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.869
 and in what way money is divided 

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:39.639
 40% divided equally to all have the same share 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:42.549
 30% based on crowd size 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.929
 30% that way 5% 

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:47.679
 based on the population of the city to the 

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:51.549
 25% based on the number of team fans but search 

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:56.249
 research institutes he finished second the other 30% 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.949
 so what they call sports merit this leader 5% 

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:03.279
 the classification of the last championship 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:07.059
 15% considering the classification of the last five 

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:08.169
 championships 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:11.779
 the other 10% a green historic rating from the beginning of a 

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:13.389
 new life in titan 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:17.299
 it is evident that the steve mcclaren was lived a part alike 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:18.959
 a part of the value of the crowd 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.070
 I deal with the club that comes from within the field and the story he has 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.310
 so it works from now on start doing what you can for the distributor 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.689
 fast car if part of the day 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:34.019
 paulo and in germany how will it work in that band how 

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:37.219
 hello friends out of game 

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:42.939
 television rights to live football in Germany 

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:43.889
 a criterion 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.230
 this established criterion 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.400
 by the German Football League 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.650
 the bundesliga 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.139
 which is made up of 36 professional clubs 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.869
 18 in the first division and 18 in the second division 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:59.039
 every four years 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:02.039
 the league makes a competition 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.850
 various tevez particular 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.319
 to be able to broadcast all live games 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:14.649
 won this time in 2010 the company unloads the old tv to 'premier that 

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:17.479
 will pay the German football league 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:19.830
 the amount of conciliation 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.289
 and 500 million euros 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:24.680
 for four years of contract 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:31.300
 in the frigir of the eggs currently 75% of that value for the first division and 25% 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.960
 of this value for the second division 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.889
 and the clubs how they stay 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:40.020
 the clubs are thus the champion of the first division received 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.159
 about 

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:42.069
 per annum 

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:44.569
 EUR 25 million 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:47.380
 last placed 18th placed 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.189
 sb 

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:51.090
 on average 12 million and 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.290
 500 thousand euros is like this 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.330
 that works in germany 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.240
 is the form the German league found 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.810
 for what more or less actively quito team 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:02.759
 to satisfy 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:04.889
 at 36 with the professionals 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:05.889
 from bundesliga
