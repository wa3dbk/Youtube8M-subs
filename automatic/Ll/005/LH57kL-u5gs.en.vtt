00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:15.300
 we show the keys of milestones next to five of the best equipment of our 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.060
 country 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.369
 during the day five matches were played in five types of matches 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:22.339
 different 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:25.339
 all special modifications of the league 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.380
 the first game faced his opera ask to impose and that in victory in the 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.320
 asylum map 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.910
 both teams must take the flag that is in the base of the rival 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.440
 take her back to her own 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.860
 already in the first play inertia of shock takes the flag and advances for the part 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.760
 get off the map without resistance 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.760
 Maybe he's giving voice to a rival on the ramp 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.280
 Greece is about to score but it appears they are leaving or leaving you without a shield 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.420
 vermin from below is responsible for eliminating the threat and allows 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.420
 I was investing I wrote down finally 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.620
 on the opposite side in achieving two vienna 14 censors quickly 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.620
 and the flag is carried jumping through the fountains 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.750
 in a last attempt ludington from the other end of the map tries to stop it and what 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.070
 get 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.440
 but ancofe finn very attentive picks up the flag 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.929
 is directed to base of faith and gets the tie to one 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.600
 again players are free to invest in attacking the rival base 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.630
 rathy takes care of the coverage and manages to get down to two while 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.960
 He had fun on the left side, he took advantage to take the 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.520
 flag 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.830
 liberty advance bluntly towards your base where health and are to support you and 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.990
 get scoring in a great direct play 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.150
 and so we would reach the end of the game with 2 to 1 in favor of that which was 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:11.000
 small the second match faced SMEs cio against and allianz on the map 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.890
 reflection on a motorcycle like this has been by teams the objective to eliminate 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.679
 fifty rivals 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:23.269
 the match begins and we see as tarp sol the pyre mind taking command of the 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:28.059
 departure and thanks to his successes get several killer boats 

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:31.559
 thus achieving an important advantage in the scoreboard 

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:37.469
 Darcos does not want to be left behind and clinches the advantage with a demonstration 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:40.469
 of use of the writer 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:43.330
 investment 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.510
 He does not give up 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:51.330
 but the difference becomes insurmountable and finally the doctor notes the last and 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.239
 definitive point 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.439
 final result are 50 'anti-messi' another company 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.100
 we go to the countdown map in which they faced obvious hector ey 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.170
 mou sión have in assault mode the teams have to catch the bomb of the 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.170
 center of the map and detonate the in the rival base 

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:16.799
 they become objective players to anticipate and quickly collect the 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:17.689
 bomb 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:22.680
 it already carries with it and permanently a moment weakening cidh seen 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:29.290
 I was really waiting for the right moment to jump to the rival base to help 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.839
 to clean the area and get the first point for your team 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:42.439
 time passes and the marker does not move but kruger protected by his team already 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:46.869
 less than four minutes from the end equals the score 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:54.499
 everything suggested a draw but a little more than a minute before the end 

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:56.249
 have gone down 1 

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:59.249
 low towards the base it is passed to the second 

00:03:59.869 --> 00:04:05.279
 it comes out girona granada goes down to the third triple death nashville removes 

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:08.999
 to the fourth take the pump turns back 

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:15.900
 and get in-extremis with a victory for his team who nobody had 

00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:18.749
 provided 

00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:24.989
 productive and we decided londonense would dispute the territories of asylum 

00:04:24.989 --> 00:04:27.499
 in the next confrontation 

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:32.089
 three zones conquer them and one point per second and by controlled territory 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.840
 puma player who would eventually reveal himself as the key man of the 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.400
 party is done nothing else start with him is my power if he starts to deal 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.500
 shots thus controlling not only its base but also the central area of ​​the map 

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:52.289
 here we should end up with a fun player 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:58.779
 advancing and getting reconquer the most important territory the central 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:04.870
 and again that it goes up a killing streak is achieved and it becomes again 

00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:07.869
 with another territory it hits dance 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:11.930
 after going the first part below on the scoreboard 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.229
 and dress manages to turn the game around a few minutes from the end 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:21.270
 even controlling the three territories simultaneously 

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:27.269
 but finally motion to regain control largely thanks to some 

00:05:27.269 --> 00:05:32.489
 final minutes in which pumamarca again the differences 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:41.120
 with his second victory motion fear was confirmed as the revelation of this 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.099
 machine room etc 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:48.559
 the last match would face is altered come with the alliance in heat

 in the world crazy ball 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:55.430
 in this way the teams need to keep the ball in their possession to add 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:56.559
 points 

00:05:56.559 --> 00:06:01.379
 if we found from the beginning it was done with the ball prioritizing its defense 

00:06:03.249 --> 00:06:06.960
 a spectacular tarks chained 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.729
 death after his death until first getting a streak the idea is therefore a 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:17.530
 killer frenzy on one of the plays of the day 

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:25.080
 very well grouped beaches defended themselves from the constant attacks desire 

00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:30.509
 control of the second floor by the entire team and the 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:35.430
