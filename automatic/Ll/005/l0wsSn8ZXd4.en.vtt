and<00:01:47.799> trying<00:01:48.490> to<00:01:48.640> see<00:01:48.880> we<00:01:49.120> can<00:01:49.330> find<00:01:49.750> new<00:01:50.140> ways

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
and trying to see we can find new ways

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.820 
and trying to see we can find new ways
to<00:01:51.040> treat<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:52.210> patients<00:01:52.750> and<00:01:52.900> have<00:01:53.560> their

to treat the patients and have their
manage<00:01:54.790> the<00:01:55.030> diseases<00:01:55.540> so<00:01:55.780> they<00:01:55.930> can<00:01:56.229> have

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
manage the diseases so they can have

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.249 
manage the diseases so they can have
