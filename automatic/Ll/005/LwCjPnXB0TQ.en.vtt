cannula<00:02:00.770> here<00:02:01.479> to<00:02:02.479> create<00:02:02.750> what<00:02:03.080> we<00:02:03.229> call<00:02:03.500> as<00:02:03.740> I

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
cannula here to create what we call as I

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.460 
cannula here to create what we call as I
said<00:02:04.700> tunnels<00:02:05.180> and<00:02:05.420> he's<00:02:05.600> gonna<00:02:05.810> remove<00:02:06.229> a

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
said tunnels and he's gonna remove a

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.160 
said tunnels and he's gonna remove a
little<00:02:06.619> bit<00:02:06.860> of<00:02:06.979> fat<00:02:07.280> you<00:02:08.239> can<00:02:08.420> see<00:02:08.690> we<00:02:08.989> have

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
little bit of fat you can see we have

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.990 
little bit of fat you can see we have
just<00:02:09.379> a<00:02:09.470> bunch<00:02:09.649> of<00:02:09.769> flabby<00:02:10.069> skin<00:02:10.280> now<00:02:10.700> at<00:02:10.729> this

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
just a bunch of flabby skin now at this

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.600 
just a bunch of flabby skin now at this
point<00:02:11.330> we've<00:02:12.080> loosened<00:02:12.349> it<00:02:12.650> up<00:02:12.799> and<00:02:13.040> that<00:02:13.370> skin

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
point we've loosened it up and that skin

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.429 
point we've loosened it up and that skin
wants<00:02:13.879> to<00:02:14.000> tighten<00:02:14.209> and<00:02:14.510> we're<00:02:14.959> gonna<00:02:15.049> kick

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:15.439 
wants to tighten and we're gonna kick

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:17.229 
wants to tighten and we're gonna kick
start<00:02:15.769> it<00:02:15.860> with<00:02:16.099> using<00:02:16.489> some<00:02:16.700> heat<00:02:16.939> with<00:02:17.209> a

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
start it with using some heat with a

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.589 
start it with using some heat with a
laser<00:02:17.569> okay<00:02:18.110> yeah<00:02:19.040> she<00:02:19.420> enjoyed<00:02:20.420> and

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
laser okay yeah she enjoyed and

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.080 
laser okay yeah she enjoyed and
obviously<00:02:21.140> she<00:02:21.590> was<00:02:21.799> she<00:02:22.400> was<00:02:22.550> locally

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
obviously she was she was locally

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.270 
obviously she was she was locally
anesthetized<00:02:23.840> she's<00:02:24.110> falling<00:02:24.440> away<00:02:24.530> she's

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
anesthetized she's falling away she's

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.370 
anesthetized she's falling away she's
not<00:02:25.459> in<00:02:25.670> any<00:02:25.880> discomfort<00:02:26.360> well<00:02:26.750> Jordan<00:02:26.990> I<00:02:27.200> can

tell you
our<00:02:27.870> our<00:02:28.200> audience<00:02:28.860> I<00:02:29.130> think<00:02:29.430> was<00:02:29.550> struggling

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
our our audience I think was struggling

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.570 
our our audience I think was struggling
more<00:02:30.240> than<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.710> we're<00:02:31.710> gonna<00:02:31.800> check<00:02:32.070> back<00:02:32.130> in

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
more than you we're gonna check back in

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.920 
more than you we're gonna check back in
with<00:02:32.730> all<00:02:32.910> of<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.150> in<00:02:33.330> a<00:02:33.420> bit<00:02:33.600> but<00:02:33.780> right<00:02:33.900> now

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
with all of you in a bit but right now

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.620 
with all of you in a bit but right now
it's<00:02:36.930> time<00:02:37.170> for<00:02:37.230> Phase<00:02:37.530> two<00:02:37.830> of<00:02:38.550> this<00:02:39.000> process

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
it's time for Phase two of this process

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.840 
it's time for Phase two of this process
now<00:02:39.960> we<00:02:40.020> can<00:02:40.320> get<00:02:40.500> another<00:02:41.070> level<00:02:41.520> of

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
now we can get another level of

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.300 
now we can get another level of
shrinkage<00:02:42.360> by<00:02:42.990> using<00:02:43.530> this<00:02:43.680> great<00:02:44.070> little

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
shrinkage by using this great little

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.550 
shrinkage by using this great little
laser<00:02:44.610> and<00:02:45.000> as<00:02:45.360> I<00:02:45.510> put<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:45.900> my<00:02:46.050> hand<00:02:46.290> Wow

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
laser and as I put it to my hand Wow

laser and as I put it to my hand Wow
it's<00:02:46.800> starting<00:02:47.100> to<00:02:47.160> get<00:02:47.280> hot

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
it's starting to get hot

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.320 
it's starting to get hot
we're<00:02:48.000> shrink-wrapping<00:02:48.900> right<00:02:49.080> exactly<00:02:50.330> well

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
we're shrink-wrapping right exactly well

tunnelling with his cannulae removed a

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.550 
tunnelling with his cannulae removed a
little<00:03:17.850> bit<00:03:17.940> of<00:03:18.030> fat<00:03:18.270> but<00:03:18.780> now<00:03:19.020> it's<00:03:19.290> time<00:03:19.500> for

little bit of fat but now it's time for
skin<00:03:20.040> tightening<00:03:20.580> how's<00:03:21.030> that<00:03:21.240> being<00:03:21.510> done<00:03:21.690> is

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
skin tightening how's that being done is

that's<00:03:24.900> gonna<00:03:25.080> contract<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.890> skin<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.700> help

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
that's gonna contract the skin and help

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.470 
that's gonna contract the skin and help
form<00:03:27.690> new<00:03:28.100> collagen<00:03:29.100> exactly<00:03:29.700> now<00:03:29.910> we<00:03:29.970> can<00:03:30.300> get

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
form new collagen exactly now we can get

another level of shrinkage by using this
great<00:03:34.050> little<00:03:34.260> laser<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:34.950> as<00:03:35.310> I<00:03:35.490> put<00:03:35.670> it<00:03:35.760> to<00:03:35.880> my

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
great little laser and as I put it to my

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.880 
great little laser and as I put it to my
hand<00:03:36.240> wow<00:03:36.510> it's<00:03:36.780> starting<00:03:37.050> to<00:03:37.140> get<00:03:37.260> hot<00:03:37.500> and

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
hand wow it's starting to get hot and

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.590 
hand wow it's starting to get hot and
that's<00:03:38.250> exactly<00:03:38.880> what<00:03:39.030> it's<00:03:39.180> going<00:03:39.330> to<00:03:39.390> do

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
that's exactly what it's going to do

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.900 
that's exactly what it's going to do
shrink-wrapping<00:03:40.410> right<00:03:40.800> exactly<00:03:41.670> what

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
shrink-wrapping right exactly what

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
shrink wrap and what I'm doing with this

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.300 
shrink wrap and what I'm doing with this
little<00:03:45.030> device<00:03:45.209> I'm<00:03:45.690> holding<00:03:45.720> I'm<00:03:46.470> monitoring
