Henderson<00:01:57.119> Nevada<00:01:57.359> and<00:01:58.280> I<00:01:59.280> worked<00:01:59.759> with

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
Henderson Nevada and I worked with

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.059 
Henderson Nevada and I worked with
people<00:02:00.209> who<00:02:00.509> have<00:02:00.750> done<00:02:00.929> a<00:02:01.170> great<00:02:01.319> deal<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.619> 3d

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:02.069 
people who have done a great deal of 3d

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:06.679 
people who have done a great deal of 3d
research<00:02:02.459> and<00:02:03.200> I<00:02:05.149> have<00:02:06.149> looked<00:02:06.390> at<00:02:06.539> all<00:02:06.659> of

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
research and I have looked at all of

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.440 
research and I have looked at all of
this<00:02:06.929> research<00:02:07.349> and<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.489> have<00:02:08.640> concluded<00:02:08.910> that

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
this research and I have concluded that

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.400 
this research and I have concluded that
the<00:02:10.110> glasses<00:02:10.679> are<00:02:11.039> problematic<00:02:11.940> for<00:02:12.540> the

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
the glasses are problematic for the

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.289 
the glasses are problematic for the
larger<00:02:13.799> screens<00:02:14.129> because<00:02:14.400> there<00:02:14.790> is<00:02:14.910> no<00:02:15.060> one

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
larger screens because there is no one

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.800 
larger screens because there is no one
standard<00:02:15.840> out<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:17.370> also<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.120> viewing<00:02:18.420> angles

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
standard out and also the viewing angles

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.190 
standard out and also the viewing angles
have<00:02:18.989> to<00:02:19.049> be<00:02:19.290> far<00:02:19.739> more<00:02:20.360> calibrated<00:02:21.360> on<00:02:21.870> the

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
have to be far more calibrated on the

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.309 
have to be far more calibrated on the
other<00:02:22.379> hand<00:02:23.299> panasonic<00:02:24.299> has<00:02:24.329> just<00:02:24.690> launched<00:02:25.110> a

about small devices is that you don't
need<00:02:43.739> glasses<00:02:44.099> to<00:02:44.639> view<00:02:44.880> 3d<00:02:45.389> it's<00:02:46.170> almost<00:02:46.410> as

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
need glasses to view 3d it's almost as

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.979 
need glasses to view 3d it's almost as
