 Hi, Juliana. I'm here with Sony. 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.860
 our technique 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.720
 andressa, our propaganda girl 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.380
 will present to you step by step 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.940
 of the technical alignment system could 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.250
 enjoy an alignment system cap 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.740
 oil- based kalamo oil based 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.250
 process is not composed of shampoo that 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.149
 is client ph balanced at 11 and mask 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.839
 or foot 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:41.179
 step 2 it deals with carbohydrates purposes 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:42.649
 reducing the physical volume leaving the 

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:44.989
 hair with a natural movement and 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.089
 is compatible with any 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.579
 type of hair and chemicals and has 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:50.749
 36-month durability with the exception of 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.729
 growth 

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:55.460
 has a composite maintenance line 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:57.289
 by leave in conditioner shampoo 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.289
 mask after chemistry that prolongs the 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.819
 effect of the alignment to start the 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.589
 capillary momentum is required 

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:05.299
 check the health of the hair 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.560
 taking into account the resistance of the 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.830
 yarns used previously 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.930
 important 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.120
 the capillary alignment should not be used 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:19.220
 children and pregnant women 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:21.260
 make an opening of the cuticles eyes 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.660
 hair and apply the anti-waste shampoo 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.470
 flexing all the hair from the root to the 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.940
 tips 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.940
 avoiding to use the nail in the scalp 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.320
 to charm the wires and repeat the 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:43.090
 shampoo fictioning all the hair well 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:45.579
 again for hoes again 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.500
 hair shampoo again 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.899
 repeating the same process of fiction 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.360
 leaves the shampoo acts on the hair for not 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.659
 maximum 20 minutes checking the opening 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.659
 of cuticles 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.630
 then rinse all hair from 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.200
 dry it with a dryer in the hot air of the 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.200
 root to tips 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.270
 step 2 the application of the mask I want 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.270
 screen 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.390
 divide the hair into four courtyards tests 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.390
 nape and ear to ear 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.860
 application of the product begins with the 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.140
 Help depends brush on one of the 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.950
 participation in the product in 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.950
 bottom up 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.920
 after applying on all hair toss 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.930
 free drying 80-100 percent for 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.010
 that there is evaporation of alcohol who 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.010
 to cause discomfort 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.860
 step 3 alignment 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.530
 divide the hair into four parts in 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.010
 followed by part applied to wicks 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.010
 fine 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.280
 a board of a hurry and each in the 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.950
 queen 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.460
 hold the plank position the comb on the 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.320
 front and descend from root to tip 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:54.590
 slowly repeating this same process 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:57.260
 three times in the same wick do the same 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.780
 in all the parts applied or by 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:04.790
 wick to be sealed 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:06.710
 step 4 sealing the cuticles for the 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.050
 Cuticle training is necessary 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.060
 a plank of good quality high 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.780
 growth and that there is no 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:17.450
 its closed state separate fine wicks 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.940
 move the board slowly from the root 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.170
 tips to keep the heating up for 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.770
 15 times 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.300
 according to the type of hair repeat 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.130
 procedure in the rest of the 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.130
 hair doing one game at a time 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.870
 tip 1 for a perfect result 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:44.840
 the hair must be perfectly closed 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:47.030
 from root to tip indicators for 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.220
 blond hair should work with the 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.729
 plank with a maximum temperature of 180 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.729
 degrees 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.030
 tip 3 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.250
 in the case of hair that will be the 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.590
 it is necessary that first 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:07.280
 make an exploration and then do the 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:09.500
 sealing followed dramatizes hint 4 to 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.389
 the retouching of dark colors 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.910
 application must be made after the 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:17.509
 particle cancellation for color 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:19.039
 clear above 8 light blonde should be 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:25.310
 before sealing the 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:27.530
 cuticle tips for relaxed hair 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:30.800
 with chemical processes and thioglycolate 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:33.740
 ammonium and etalonamine can be 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.139
 application of the bridge the same day or 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.090
 measure sodium hydroxide to wait for a 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:41.240
 week due to the sensitivity of the 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:43.310
 scalp and neither reindeer wait 30 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.639
 days for application on metals 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.639
 heavy 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.180
 so washing 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.670
 after the cuticles are canceled in 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.960
 all hair now five minutes

 money for the maintenance of brightness and 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.700
 silkiness of threads 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.170
 recommended that the use of the 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.390
 maintenance per day 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:11.750
 the theme the dani is composed by shampoo

 chemistry and the sex with the 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:20.450
 help of a hair dryer tip tip 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.250
 is resected due to processes 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:24.770
 previous chemists 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.690
 It recommends the use of post mask 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.470
 chemical maintenance for money in place 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.470
 of the conditioner 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.450
 then this is the end result of 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:41.540
 alignment part and hope you guys 

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:44.900
 have enjoyed passions if you too
