00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
of course as you can tell here if you

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.590 
of course as you can tell here if you

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
didn't have the plastic gloves it would

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.630

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
your fingertips which doesn't really

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.420 
your fingertips which doesn't really
wash<00:01:17.189> off<00:01:17.460> very<00:01:17.790> well<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.479> i<00:01:19.350> think<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:20.220> gloves

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
wash off very well so i think the gloves

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.429 
wash off very well so i think the gloves
are<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.820> must<00:01:21.060> go<00:01:21.659> ahead<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:21.900> by<00:01:21.960> squeezing<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
are a must go ahead and by squeezing the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.530 
are a must go ahead and by squeezing the
top<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.520> cylinder<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.000> squeezing<00:01:24.450> the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
top of the cylinder and squeezing the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.789 
top of the cylinder and squeezing the
bottom<00:01:24.869> at<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.020> same<00:01:25.259> time<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.710> then

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
bottom at the same time and then

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.310 
bottom at the same time and then
rotating<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:27.360> can<00:01:27.479> get<00:01:27.570> quite<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.900> bit<00:01:28.200> of

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
rotating it you can get quite a bit of

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.490 
rotating it you can get quite a bit of
the<00:01:28.409> ink<00:01:28.590> out<00:01:29.210> but<00:01:30.210> at<00:01:30.390> some<00:01:30.659> point<00:01:30.689> here<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.470> i

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
the ink out but at some point here and i

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.109 
the ink out but at some point here and i
want<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.740> take<00:01:31.890> too<00:01:31.920> long<00:01:32.280> as<00:01:32.579> I'm<00:01:32.790> doing<00:01:33.030> this

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
want to take too long as I'm doing this

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.760 
want to take too long as I'm doing this
because<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.509> don't<00:01:33.659> want<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.990> concentration

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
because I don't want the concentration

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.640 
because I don't want the concentration
of<00:01:34.829> ink<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.189> be<00:01:35.280> diluted<00:01:35.700> too<00:01:36.060> much<00:01:36.210> right<00:01:36.509> now

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
of ink to be diluted too much right now

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.880 
blade and I had to cut a slit and
cheating<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.860> peel<00:01:44.130> away<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.850> cotton<00:01:45.890> this

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
cheating and a peel away the cotton this

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.850 
cheating and a peel away the cotton this
depends<00:01:47.340> on<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.700> whether<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.899> have<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.590> razor

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
depends on you whether you have a razor

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.679 
depends on you whether you have a razor
blade<00:01:49.979> if<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.520> don't<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:50.970> got<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.240> keep<00:01:51.390> doing

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
blade if you don't you got to keep doing

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.770 
blade if you don't you got to keep doing
this<00:01:51.780> process<00:01:52.130> but<00:01:53.130> as<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:54.030> can<00:01:54.119> tell<00:01:54.180> there's

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
this process but as you can tell there's

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.240 
this process but as you can tell there's
quite<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.020> bit<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.229> ink<00:01:55.409> still<00:01:55.649> in<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.829> center

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
quite a bit of ink still in the center

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.090 
quite a bit of ink still in the center
so<00:01:57.140> what<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.229> do<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.380> go<00:01:58.560> ahead<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.920> put<00:01:59.070> that

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
so what you do is go ahead and put that

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.760 
so what you do is go ahead and put that
slid<00:01:59.520> in<00:01:59.670> there<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.689> you'd<00:02:01.110> eventually<00:02:01.350> get

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
slid in there and you'd eventually get

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.410 
slid in there and you'd eventually get
all<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.009> ink<00:02:02.189> out<00:02:02.340> if<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:03.000> didn't<00:02:03.240> have<00:02:03.329> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
all the ink out if you didn't have the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.929 
all the ink out if you didn't have the
razor<00:02:03.600> blade<00:02:03.899> but<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:05.159> just<00:02:05.399> peel<00:02:05.700> away<00:02:05.820> the

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
razor blade but you just peel away the

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.969 
razor blade but you just peel away the
plastic<00:02:06.240> sheeting<00:02:07.049> tour<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.680> reveal<00:02:07.950> the
