00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:05.520
The Theatre Workgroup of
the Kelkheim Eichendorff School (Germany)
proudly presents

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.000
Friedrich Schiller's
"Cabals and Love"

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.360
The story of a great love...

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.200
...between the noble son of the president...

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.120
"My home country lies wherever Luise will love me!"

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.800
"You, Luise, and me - and Love!"

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.040
"What more could heaven mean to us?"

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.840
...and the daughter of a middle-class fiddler.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.840
"Ferdinand ... was made for me"

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.520
"When I saw him for the first time..."

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.080
"... all my veins were pulsing so happily!"

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.560
Their love is in danger

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.440
"Take her as his bride? Impossible!"

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.800
"Shall the father respect the wench of his son?"

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.800
"Let him go!"

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.960
"A pious, religious wife she will be for me."

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.920
An outrageous, extortionate fraud...

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.080
"We will make her write a love-letter to a third person..."

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.240
... that mankind has never witnessed before.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.480
"It just cannot be...!"

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.880
"How far did your connexion go?"

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.960
"Didst you write this letter?"

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.040
"Have you loved that marshal?"

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.600
"A terrible fate ..."

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.160
...tearing the intimacy of two hearts...

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.320
...asunder.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.320
The web of intrigue is satanically precise 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.800
"The very moment that separates these hands...

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.840
... will cut the thread between me and creation."

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.240
