00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
hello again and thank you for tuning in

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.140 
hello again and thank you for tuning in
this<00:00:03.780> video<00:00:04.140> is<00:00:04.470> about<00:00:04.620> a<00:00:05.279> contract<00:00:05.940> that<00:00:06.089> I

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
this video is about a contract that I

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.470 
this video is about a contract that I
had<00:00:06.480> when<00:00:07.730> actually<00:00:08.730> it<00:00:08.820> was<00:00:08.910> before<00:00:09.179> I

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
had when actually it was before I

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.499 
had when actually it was before I
started<00:00:09.660> doing<00:00:09.960> contracts<00:00:10.769> this<00:00:11.460> is<00:00:11.610> before<00:00:11.820> I

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
started doing contracts this is before I

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.499 
started doing contracts this is before I
did<00:00:12.929> my<00:00:13.080> six-year<00:00:13.620> stint<00:00:13.920> with<00:00:14.370> AT&amp;T<00:00:15.089> as<00:00:15.480> a

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
did my six-year stint with AT&amp;T as a

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.990 
did my six-year stint with AT&amp;T as a
special<00:00:16.080> investigator<00:00:18.470> before<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:20.130> was

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
special investigator before that I was

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.910 
special investigator before that I was
taking<00:00:21.300> on<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.449> whole<00:00:21.900> boatload<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.410> small

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
taking on a whole boatload of small

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.640 
taking on a whole boatload of small
contracts<00:00:23.760> maybe<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.689> week<00:00:24.960> two<00:00:25.230> weeks<00:00:25.260> long

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
contracts maybe a week two weeks long

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.140 
contracts maybe a week two weeks long
sometimes<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.970> month<00:00:27.180> at<00:00:27.480> most<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:29.090> one<00:00:30.090> of

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
sometimes a month at most and one of

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.970 
sometimes a month at most and one of
those<00:00:30.269> contracts<00:00:30.810> was<00:00:31.050> for<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.470> space-weapons

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
those contracts was for a space-weapons

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.060 
those contracts was for a space-weapons
defense<00:00:32.640> contractor<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.649> I'm<00:00:34.649> not<00:00:34.860> going<00:00:35.010> to

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
defense contractor and I'm not going to

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.400 
defense contractor and I'm not going to
say<00:00:35.160> who<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.430> was<00:00:35.579> but<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.450> will<00:00:36.870> say<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.290> they

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
say who it was but I will say that they

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.260 
say who it was but I will say that they
were<00:00:37.469> attached<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.370> naval<00:00:38.700> space<00:00:38.969> warfare

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
were attached to the naval space warfare

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.680 
were attached to the naval space warfare
Department<00:00:40.020> alright<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.160> this<00:00:42.120> video<00:00:42.300> is

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
Department alright so this video is

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.619 
Department alright so this video is
about<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.770> naval<00:00:44.340> space<00:00:44.610> warfare<00:00:44.879> department

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
about the naval space warfare department

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.440 
about the naval space warfare department
people<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:46.649> need<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.890> understand<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:48.149> Navy

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
people you need to understand the Navy

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.020 
people you need to understand the Navy
has<00:00:48.750> spaceships<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:50.160> army<00:00:50.520> has<00:00:50.700> spaceships

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
has spaceships the army has spaceships

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.930 
has spaceships the army has spaceships
the<00:00:51.719> Marines<00:00:52.160> okay<00:00:53.190> they're<00:00:53.550> not<00:00:53.699> really

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
the Marines okay they're not really

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.100 
the Marines okay they're not really
called<00:00:54.449> spaceships

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
called spaceships

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.610 
called spaceships
they're<00:00:55.649> more<00:00:56.100> like<00:00:56.250> UFOs<00:00:57.230> only<00:00:58.230> we<00:00:58.350> call<00:00:58.559> them

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
they're more like UFOs only we call them

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.520 
they're more like UFOs only we call them
other<00:00:59.100> things<00:00:59.370> like<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.149> wing<00:01:00.359> or<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.440> tr-3b

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
other things like the wing or the tr-3b

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.399 
other things like the wing or the tr-3b
Astro<00:01:04.530> locust<00:01:05.070> okay<00:01:05.909> these<00:01:06.240> ships<00:01:06.540> have<00:01:06.720> quasi

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
Astro locust okay these ships have quasi

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.710 
Astro locust okay these ships have quasi
crystals<00:01:07.799> on<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.010> outside<00:01:08.430> they<00:01:09.060> employ<00:01:09.420> a

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
crystals on the outside they employ a

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.660 
crystals on the outside they employ a
unique<00:01:10.049> engine<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.740> allows<00:01:11.010> them<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.460> have

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
unique engine that allows them to have

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.440 
unique engine that allows them to have
near<00:01:12.920> anti-gravity<00:01:13.920> qualities<00:01:14.430> they<00:01:15.150> make

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
near anti-gravity qualities they make

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.719 
near anti-gravity qualities they make
absolutely<00:01:15.720> zero<00:01:16.409> sound<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.070> quasi<00:01:17.400> crystals

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
absolutely zero sound the quasi crystals

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.160 
absolutely zero sound the quasi crystals
change<00:01:17.970> color<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.540> they<00:01:18.659> can<00:01:18.810> match<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:18.990> color

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
change color so they can match the color

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.859 
change color so they can match the color
of<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.500> sky<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.549> ship<00:01:20.820> can<00:01:21.030> appear<00:01:21.509> hidden

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
of the sky so the ship can appear hidden

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.050 
of the sky so the ship can appear hidden
above<00:01:22.170> us<00:01:22.520> some<00:01:23.520> people<00:01:23.670> have<00:01:23.909> actually

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
above us some people have actually

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.760 
above us some people have actually
captured<00:01:24.570> these<00:01:24.689> ships<00:01:24.990> in<00:01:25.259> remote<00:01:25.560> areas

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
captured these ships in remote areas

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.560 
captured these ships in remote areas
where<00:01:26.189> they<00:01:26.369> weren't<00:01:26.700> engaging<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.210> quasi

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
where they weren't engaging the quasi

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.819 
where they weren't engaging the quasi
crystals<00:01:27.930> because<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.290> does<00:01:28.470> take<00:01:28.650> an

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
crystals because it does take an

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.370 
crystals because it does take an
enormous<00:01:28.920> amount<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.430> power<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:30.200> cause<00:01:31.200> the

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
enormous amount of power to cause the

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.260 
enormous amount of power to cause the
quasi<00:01:31.710> crystals<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.159> change<00:01:32.400> color<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:33.150> order

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
quasi crystals to change color in order

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.710 
quasi crystals to change color in order
to<00:01:33.450> match<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.920> environment<00:01:34.920> around<00:01:35.009> them<00:01:35.720> so

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
to match the environment around them so

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.230 
to match the environment around them so
sometimes<00:01:37.350> they<00:01:37.770> don't<00:01:37.860> turn<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.670> some

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
sometimes they don't turn it on and some

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.460 
sometimes they don't turn it on and some
people<00:01:39.509> have<00:01:39.630> actually<00:01:39.810> captured<00:01:40.350> these

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
people have actually captured these

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.120 
people have actually captured these
ships<00:01:41.119> floating<00:01:42.119> or<00:01:42.299> hovering<00:01:42.659> above<00:01:43.130> forest

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
ships floating or hovering above forest

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.240 
ships floating or hovering above forest
areas<00:01:44.600> one<00:01:45.600> video<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:45.990> particular<00:01:46.259> captured<00:01:47.159> a

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
areas one video in particular captured a

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.100 
areas one video in particular captured a
ship<00:01:47.460> floating<00:01:47.700> above<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.240> forest<00:01:48.509> area<00:01:48.899> and

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
ship floating above the forest area and

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.160 
ship floating above the forest area and
then<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.290> engages<00:01:50.540> what's<00:01:51.540> basically<00:01:51.810> a

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
then it engages what's basically a

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.410 
then it engages what's basically a
transporter<00:01:52.920> beam<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.460> looks<00:01:53.970> like<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.119> white

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
transporter beam it looks like a white

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.789 
transporter beam it looks like a white
beam<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:54.930> shoots<00:01:55.140> out<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.470> front<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.740> the

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
beam that shoots out of the front of the

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.249 
beam that shoots out of the front of the
ship<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.280> what<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.030> does<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.780> literally

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
ship and what that does is it literally

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.310 
ship and what that does is it literally
converts<00:01:58.759> solid<00:01:59.759> matter<00:01:59.939> into<00:02:00.270> energy<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.899> a

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
converts solid matter into energy in a

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.620 
converts solid matter into energy in a
split<00:02:01.590> second<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.130> then<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:03.270> then<00:02:03.600> that

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
split second and then and then that

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.929 
split second and then and then that
matter<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.259> reka<00:02:04.649> converted<00:02:05.579> into<00:02:05.729> solid

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
matter is reka converted into solid

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.229 
matter is reka converted into solid
matter<00:02:06.329> on<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.810> ship<00:02:07.129> at<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.340> same<00:02:08.550> time<00:02:08.849> so

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
matter on the ship at the same time so

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.999 
matter on the ship at the same time so
you<00:02:09.810> only<00:02:09.929> see<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.259> beam<00:02:10.410> for<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.770> few

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
you only see the beam for a few

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.750 
you only see the beam for a few
milliseconds

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
milliseconds

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.850 
milliseconds
and<00:02:11.909> then<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.209> ship<00:02:12.420> takes<00:02:12.750> off<00:02:12.989> at<00:02:13.319> like<00:02:13.530> Mach

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
and then the ship takes off at like Mach

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.990 
and then the ship takes off at like Mach
6<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.629> that's<00:02:15.629> not<00:02:15.950> impossible<00:02:16.950> because<00:02:17.819> the

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
6 and that's not impossible because the

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000 
6 and that's not impossible because the
technology<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.840> ship<00:02:19.049> uses<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.739> can<00:02:19.890> do

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
technology that the ship uses you can do

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.460 
technology that the ship uses you can do
more<00:02:20.190> research<00:02:20.580> on<00:02:20.849> the<00:02:21.000> tr-3b<00:02:21.330> astral<00:02:22.049> locust

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
more research on the tr-3b astral locust

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.789 
more research on the tr-3b astral locust
and<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:23.400> technology<00:02:23.940> that<00:02:24.150> uses<00:02:24.690> on<00:02:25.470> other

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
and the technology that uses on other

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.250 
and the technology that uses on other
videos<00:02:26.010> but<00:02:26.670> this<00:02:27.060> video<00:02:27.390> is<00:02:27.629> particularly

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
videos but this video is particularly

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.600 
videos but this video is particularly
about<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:29.160> fact<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:29.549> our<00:02:31.040> secret<00:02:32.040> military

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
about the fact that our secret military

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.850 
about the fact that our secret military

people who control the money and there

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.190 
people who control the money and there
is<00:02:48.690> something<00:02:49.650> like<00:02:50.329> what<00:02:51.329> is<00:02:51.450> it<00:02:51.690> Star<00:02:51.930> Trek

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
is something like what is it Star Trek

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.800 
is something like what is it Star Trek
up<00:02:52.560> in<00:02:52.829> space<00:02:53.160> they<00:02:53.430> have<00:02:53.640> spaceships<00:02:54.540> they

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
up in space they have spaceships they

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.780 
up in space they have spaceships they
have<00:02:55.109> all<00:02:55.379> space<00:02:55.769> stations<00:02:56.280> they<00:02:56.459> have<00:02:56.579> all

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
have all space stations they have all

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.069 
have all space stations they have all
this<00:02:56.910> stuff<00:02:57.120> going<00:02:57.180> on<00:02:57.510> up<00:02:57.720> there

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
this stuff going on up there

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.410 
this stuff going on up there
but<00:02:58.769> if<00:02:59.310> you<00:02:59.459> remember<00:02:59.760> Star<00:03:00.000> Trek<00:03:00.299> II

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
but if you remember Star Trek II

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.300 
but if you remember Star Trek II
remember<00:03:00.720> there<00:03:00.840> was<00:03:00.959> one<00:03:00.989> episode<00:03:01.379> where

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
remember there was one episode where

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.390 
remember there was one episode where
they<00:03:02.849> show<00:03:03.329> this<00:03:03.989> alternate<00:03:04.680> universe<00:03:04.709> where

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
they show this alternate universe where

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.770 
they show this alternate universe where
a<00:03:05.459> Star<00:03:05.760> Trek<00:03:05.790> was<00:03:06.180> more<00:03:06.450> of<00:03:06.629> a<00:03:06.859> kilomole<00:03:07.859> and

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
a Star Trek was more of a kilomole and

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.780 
a Star Trek was more of a kilomole and
asked<00:03:09.780> no<00:03:09.900> questions<00:03:10.140> type<00:03:10.739> Star<00:03:11.459> Trek

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
asked no questions type Star Trek

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.119

evolved here and and the reason why we
don't<00:03:43.440> know<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.980> reason<00:03:44.190> why<00:03:44.310> they're<00:03:44.459> not

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
don't know the reason why they're not

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.180 
don't know the reason why they're not
telling<00:03:44.910> people<00:03:44.940> is<00:03:45.359> because<00:03:46.190> they're

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
telling people is because they're

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.490 
telling people is because they're
controlling<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:48.150> planets<00:03:48.630> using<00:03:48.930> implant

controlling the planets using implant

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.289 
controlling the planets using implant
technology<00:03:49.919> they<00:03:50.400> don't<00:03:50.549> want<00:03:50.849> you<00:03:51.000> to<00:03:51.030> know

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
technology they don't want you to know

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.050 
technology they don't want you to know
that<00:03:51.930> their<00:03:52.169> objective<00:03:52.680> is<00:03:52.829> to<00:03:52.889> kill<00:03:53.340> any<00:03:53.730> race

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
that their objective is to kill any race

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.670 
that their objective is to kill any race
that<00:03:54.299> comes<00:03:54.540> here<00:03:54.720> to<00:03:54.900> try<00:03:55.079> and<00:03:55.200> help<00:03:55.319> us<00:03:55.530> to

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
that comes here to try and help us to

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.330 
that comes here to try and help us to
advance<00:03:56.030> spiritually<00:03:57.030> and<00:03:57.590> to<00:03:58.590> show<00:03:59.069> us<00:03:59.220> how

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
advance spiritually and to show us how

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.159 
advance spiritually and to show us how
to<00:03:59.370> use<00:03:59.489> the<00:03:59.700> technology<00:03:59.910> for<00:04:00.660> defensive

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.169 
to use the technology for defensive

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:03.110 
to use the technology for defensive
purposes<00:04:01.200> instead<00:04:02.069> of<00:04:02.190> offensive<00:04:02.849> purposes

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
purposes instead of offensive purposes

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.280 
purposes instead of offensive purposes
and<00:04:03.629> so<00:04:04.410> they're<00:04:05.310> using<00:04:05.639> this<00:04:05.879> technology

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
and so they're using this technology

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.599 
and so they're using this technology
offensively<00:04:07.290> they<00:04:07.620> are<00:04:07.739> attacking<00:04:08.099> any<00:04:08.370> race
