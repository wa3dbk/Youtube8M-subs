00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.470
 a forest in Lower Saxony nearby 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.109
 from goddess 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.490
 here in 2007 the storm Cyril 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.340
 especially raging 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.990
 there is still much to be cleaned up 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.420
 Thursdays early in the morning are the 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.560
 Forest people are not there yet that has one 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.939
 good reason you do sport and that 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.369
 after a scientific program 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.029
 the smart name helps fit in the 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.410
 forest 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.630
 it was from the Lower Saxon 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.130
 Landesforsten initiated and in the 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.130
 University of GÃ¶ttingen developed 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.470
 sports scientist sabrina rudolf 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.420
 Why does movement for foresters know that 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.340
 important is 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.199
 many foresters are in there for years 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.660
 this profession does not work anymore 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:46.710
 to be resilient to other foresters 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.170
 work balance 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.460
 there must take over the tasks with it 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.559
 comes to a piling of 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.949
 Disability days to early 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.559
 Disability daily a lot of movement 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.019
 fresh air in the forest this is sport 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.399
 enough like the layman to think but the 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.800
 sports scientists have the 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.840
 activities of forest managers 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.940
 and found out that the 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.250
 work processes with heavy equipment around 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.009
 are healthy and especially responsive and 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.240
 shoulder hurt because they often demand 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.240
 an unnatural posture 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.080
 through targeted training creative backs 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.240
 and abdominal muscles 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.250
 so she can better the movement apparatus 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.140
 support and thus protect 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.240
 the foresters become regular 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.130
 examined and first results show 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.020
 a strengthening of the muscles and the 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:41.930
 spine as well as a better one 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:43.580
 Coordination will be with such 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.160
 Exercises and is special 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.500
 important because where the forest people 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.770
 there are no roads and no work 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.750
 forest floor lurk many stumbling blocks of 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.690
 Weekly sport has already brought many 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.820
 positive results of a questionnaire 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.729
 investigation also came out sees that 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.080
 the foresters of an improved 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.340
 health recommendations have spoken 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.479
 as they feel through this 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.650
 training fitter 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.720
 we feel that the 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.720
 Back pain has been reduced 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.140
 so the strong guys bend out 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.270
 Lower Saxony successfully before so they 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.910
 not blown away by spinal damage 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.900
 After all, only the 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.900
 trees in the forest
