hey guys so I wanted to test out the
galaxy<00:00:03.300> a8<00:00:03.480> here<00:00:04.170> to<00:00:04.410> see<00:00:04.770> how<00:00:05.069> strong<00:00:05.549> and

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
galaxy a8 here to see how strong and

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.169 
galaxy a8 here to see how strong and
durable<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.210> devices<00:00:06.899> using<00:00:07.550> my<00:00:08.550> keys<00:00:08.820> as

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
durable the devices using my keys as

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.660 
durable the devices using my keys as
well<00:00:09.360> as<00:00:09.660> my<00:00:10.260> knife<00:00:10.290> here<00:00:10.950> so<00:00:11.250> we<00:00:11.400> can

well as my knife here so we can

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.480 
well as my knife here so we can
basically<00:00:11.940> test<00:00:12.570> out<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.870> durability<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:13.769> the

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
basically test out the durability of the

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.590 
basically test out the durability of the
display<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.360> I<00:00:15.870> think<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.289> coming<00:00:16.500> with<00:00:16.920> a

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
display and I think is coming with a

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.179 
display and I think is coming with a
gorilla<00:00:18.600> glass<00:00:18.810> for<00:00:19.230> what<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.800> needs<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.130> be

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
gorilla glass for what that needs to be

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.099 
gorilla glass for what that needs to be
confirmed

you<00:04:22.019> can<00:04:22.590> see<00:04:22.830> it<00:04:22.979> seems<00:04:23.160> to<00:04:23.310> be<00:04:23.400> quite<00:04:23.639> durable

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
you can see it seems to be quite durable

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.230 
you can see it seems to be quite durable
also<00:04:25.800> obviously<00:04:26.310> we<00:04:26.370> want<00:04:26.550> to<00:04:26.760> check<00:04:27.060> these

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
also obviously we want to check these

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.340 
also obviously we want to check these
sides<00:04:27.570> here<00:04:28.080> and<00:04:28.370> see<00:04:29.370> if<00:04:29.760> they<00:04:30.690> can<00:04:30.990> survive

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
sides here and see if they can survive

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.740 
sides here and see if they can survive
as<00:04:31.590> well<00:04:31.830> and<00:04:32.550> unlike<00:04:33.060> last<00:04:33.090> time<00:04:33.419> you're

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
as well and unlike last time you're

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.820 
as well and unlike last time you're
going<00:04:33.870> to<00:04:33.990> use<00:04:34.080> a<00:04:34.110> key<00:04:34.470> first<00:04:35.060> just<00:04:36.060> to<00:04:36.710> see<00:04:37.710> if

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
going to use a key first just to see if

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:46.969 
going to use a key first just to see if
we<00:04:37.949> can<00:04:38.160> see<00:04:38.460> anything<00:04:40.039> when<00:04:41.039> I<00:04:45.320> you<00:04:46.320> see<00:04:46.590> I've

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
we can see anything when I you see I've

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.110 
we can see anything when I you see I've
just<00:04:47.120> done<00:04:48.120> that<00:04:48.360> and<00:04:48.539> I<00:04:48.599> can<00:04:48.840> see<00:04:49.760> already<00:04:50.760> is

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
just done that and I can see already is

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:58.360 
just done that and I can see already is
that<00:04:51.479> some<00:04:51.810> marks<00:04:53.479> maybe<00:04:54.479> you<00:04:54.690> can<00:04:54.870> see<00:04:55.169> that

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:06.170 

they<00:04:59.370> don't<00:04:59.520> seem<00:04:59.880> to<00:05:00.020> rub<00:05:01.020> off<00:05:04.970> so<00:05:05.970> I<00:05:06.000> think

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
they don't seem to rub off so I think

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.939 
they don't seem to rub off so I think
the<00:05:06.870> keys<00:05:07.169> here<00:05:07.680> may<00:05:08.479> actually<00:05:09.530> cause<00:05:10.530> a<00:05:10.560> mark

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949 
the keys here may actually cause a mark

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:14.750 
the keys here may actually cause a mark
on<00:05:11.160> the<00:05:11.280> side<00:05:11.520> there<00:05:11.880> so<00:05:12.530> that<00:05:13.530> is<00:05:13.760> something

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
on the side there so that is something

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.469 
on the side there so that is something
you<00:05:15.270> need<00:05:15.539> to<00:05:15.570> know<00:05:15.990> and<00:05:16.260> also<00:05:17.250> once<00:05:17.909> you<00:05:18.210> check

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
you need to know and also once you check

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:22.670 
you need to know and also once you check
out<00:05:18.690> the<00:05:18.870> knife<00:05:19.080> here<00:05:21.229> so<00:05:22.229> you<00:05:22.320> can<00:05:22.470> see

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
out the knife here so you can see

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.529 
out the knife here so you can see
straight<00:05:23.010> away<00:05:23.220> actually<00:05:23.460> before<00:05:24.120> you<00:05:24.240> can<00:05:24.419> do

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:24.539 
straight away actually before you can do

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:28.550 
straight away actually before you can do
it<00:05:24.659> hard<00:05:24.930> and<00:05:25.770> get<00:05:25.949> indents<00:05:26.370> there<00:05:26.820> and<00:05:27.560> I

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
it hard and get indents there and I

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.500 
it hard and get indents there and I
think<00:05:28.860> you<00:05:28.949> can<00:05:29.159> see<00:05:29.430> without<00:05:29.760> me<00:05:30.060> going<00:05:30.330> too

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
think you can see without me going too

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.719 
think you can see without me going too
far<00:05:30.840> into<00:05:31.050> it<00:05:31.260> it's<00:05:32.070> not<00:05:32.220> going<00:05:32.370> to<00:05:32.460> be<00:05:32.520> very

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
far into it it's not going to be very

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:36.020 
far into it it's not going to be very
durable<00:05:32.970> on<00:05:33.389> the<00:05:33.539> sides<00:05:34.130> so<00:05:35.130> do<00:05:35.760> you<00:05:35.820> bear<00:05:36.000> that

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
durable on the sides so do you bear that

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.620 
durable on the sides so do you bear that
in<00:05:36.270> mind<00:05:36.300> and<00:05:37.400> just<00:05:38.400> quickly<00:05:38.789> do<00:05:39.060> the<00:05:39.180> back<00:05:39.389> as

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
in mind and just quickly do the back as

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:54.980 
in mind and just quickly do the back as
well

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:02.150 

so<00:05:55.990> you<00:05:56.050> can<00:05:56.350> see<00:05:56.650> if<00:05:57.220> there's<00:05:57.520> anything<00:05:57.760> there

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.870 

and<00:06:04.230> it<00:06:05.230> looks<00:06:05.440> like<00:06:05.560> I<00:06:05.980> can<00:06:06.220> see<00:06:06.400> some<00:06:06.670> small

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 
and it looks like I can see some small

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.090 
and it looks like I can see some small
dents<00:06:07.600> maybe<00:06:07.870> you<00:06:08.080> can't<00:06:08.350> really<00:06:08.590> make<00:06:08.740> it<00:06:08.800> out

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
dents maybe you can't really make it out

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.150 
dents maybe you can't really make it out
too<00:06:09.430> much<00:06:09.670> but<00:06:10.150> I<00:06:10.360> can<00:06:10.900> see<00:06:11.080> some<00:06:11.380> very<00:06:11.410> small

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.160 
too much but I can see some very small

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.800 
too much but I can see some very small
dents<00:06:13.000> there<00:06:13.590> on<00:06:14.590> the<00:06:14.980> back<00:06:15.190> but<00:06:16.180> again<00:06:16.630> you

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
dents there on the back but again you

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.330 
dents there on the back but again you
know<00:06:16.930> it's<00:06:17.080> quite<00:06:17.320> difficult<00:06:17.530> to<00:06:17.800> make<00:06:17.920> out

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
know it's quite difficult to make out

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.570 
know it's quite difficult to make out
and<00:06:18.580> it<00:06:18.700> seems<00:06:18.940> to<00:06:19.120> mask<00:06:19.840> them<00:06:20.110> quite<00:06:20.410> well<00:06:20.580> you

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
and it seems to mask them quite well you

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:22.650 
and it seems to mask them quite well you
know<00:06:21.700> you<00:06:21.760> won't<00:06:21.880> be<00:06:22.030> able<00:06:22.150> to<00:06:22.300> see<00:06:22.510> it

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:22.660 
know you won't be able to see it

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.340 
know you won't be able to see it
normally<00:06:23.200> in<00:06:23.410> day-to-day<00:06:23.650> use<00:06:24.870> so<00:06:25.870> I<00:06:26.110> think

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:26.350 
normally in day-to-day use so I think

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:30.710 
normally in day-to-day use so I think
generally<00:06:27.220> here<00:06:27.670> the<00:06:28.630> device<00:06:29.250> has<00:06:30.250> passed

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 
generally here the device has passed

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.990 
generally here the device has passed
generally<00:06:31.800> when<00:06:32.800> it<00:06:32.830> comes<00:06:33.400> to<00:06:33.610> the<00:06:33.730> screen

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 
generally when it comes to the screen

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.870 
generally when it comes to the screen
strength<00:06:34.750> just<00:06:35.050> be<00:06:35.350> aware<00:06:35.560> of<00:06:35.710> the<00:06:35.920> sides<00:06:36.340> here

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 
strength just be aware of the sides here

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.580 
strength just be aware of the sides here
seem<00:06:37.390> to<00:06:37.420> be<00:06:37.630> a<00:06:37.660> little<00:06:37.810> bit<00:06:37.960> vulnerable<00:06:38.110> to

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:38.590 
seem to be a little bit vulnerable to

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.240 
seem to be a little bit vulnerable to
keys<00:06:38.890> and<00:06:39.190> the<00:06:39.790> knife<00:06:40.200> so<00:06:41.200> where<00:06:41.620> yes<00:06:41.950> just<00:06:42.190> a
