00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:08.670
 so hello everyone today I want to share 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.309
 thoughts about the knife from the company Boeing 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:17.850
 made model 810 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:22.130
 cant his very interesting need my 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.130
 a look though full of contradictions 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.619
 visual knife honestly me by 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.480
 pictures do not in any way caught when 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.329
 I took let's say in hand and held it in 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.860
 hands enjoyed this knife in principle 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.390
 I liked this knife despite 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.690
 some flaws which this knife 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.170
 still there is a major drawback 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.910
 which I consider it this here on 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.030
 first glance seeming ergonomic 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.930
 not at all ergonomic handle but 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.270
 that this handle is completely all such from 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.090
 aggressive notches from the back 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.120
 handles on the side of this finger grooves 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:04.670
 so also this one is so incomprehensible 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.409
 a ledge that probably should have 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.930
 somehow contribute to the handle here on my 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.820
 eyes and palms hurt me in the middle 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.770
 it means I have big palms rather big 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.860
 average all done to me really this one 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.970
 David come here to this finger 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.729
 middle fingers that is really uncomfortable 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.100
 for some minor works there are slicing 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.750
 products something is of course 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.590
 irrelevant 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.140
 but when cutting force when planing a tree 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.810
 let's cut the fibers from really 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.290
 really this handle is awkward and starts 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.369
 rub 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:46.470
 grace and all sorts of places is to blame 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:48.060
 also the fact that we allow the edges of the lining 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.670
 here with absolute how not processed 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.070
 processed here only this section 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.719
 trays which adjoins the blade 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.610
 these are all part of it sharp and 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.829
 still here the file is treated strange 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.259
 like places like the other way around 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.390
 could be sharp they handled these 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.450
 places that could be processed 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.490
 named acute additions to everything on the same 10 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.730
 here applied so 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.290
 here is a ribbed notch which is even bigger 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.050
 contribute to the fact that 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.360
 the hilt in the eyes and the queen in the skin therefore 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.300
 bare hand perform some kind of power 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.910
 working with a knife is very difficult though 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.530
 I will say right away that I suppose I do not spend 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.910
 all day at the computer and not 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:34.400
 working in some such areas there i 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.260
 I work on the physical work of my hand 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:41.120
 quite to themselves such not girlish not childish 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.840
 but this in the miniature feel it 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.210
 here is such a sharp handle barbed therefore 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.830
 I do not know let's carry 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.570
 gloves constantly tass as 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.940
 to use this knife i don't 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.530
 ready therefore all the same such a knife 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.030
 I probably would not have bought myself 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.650
 although in general the knife is very interesting 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.750
 uniquely serves the attention of you not 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:09.040
 wishes respect 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:12.110
 the blade here is a long 10 10 and 4 in my 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.320
 centimeter long thickness of 4 millimeters 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.410
 very so powerful moonblade tip 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.450
 it is very powerful to pick without 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.640
 no belt can break it 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.890
 while all the geometry of the knife is very 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.160
 lucky descent from almost butt 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:31.880
 4to mne general I was very surprised 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.460
 I thought that in appearance you look 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.590
 ambulance column the moon when measured 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.610
 the seat was shocked cut really 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:44.900
 ok very interesting steel knife here 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:46.430
 hard and now we 4 do not know in the edit 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.350
 it seemed to me somewhat complicated 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:55.070
 cotton although it is possible and enough for me 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.730
 ok rules relying either 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.150
 drag and drop 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.390
 then about Vityu will be easier here already micro 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.190
 supply unknown to formed therefore 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.670
 my rights as they say did not give 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:10.550
 almost no results but anyway 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.950
 forgiveness star very hard blade 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.280
 has a zera coating gray code 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.230
 seems very strong and cover it 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.670
 the owner of this knife used it 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.710
 tail and mane here already 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.080
 in several places of coatings is not that 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:28.130
 got down but some such acquired 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.410
 culture dullness or something up 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.860
 the coating is very strong and very strong 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:37.880
 cover itself as syslog 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:41.650
 everything works clearly opens absolutely 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:44.540
 without problems and at night under the Soviet falls 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.870
 the wreath is strictly centered in this plan 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.550
 no comments also in 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.300
 glass handle 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.750
 some small fight maybe 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.080
 anyone 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.700
 such a thing I need as it seems 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.490
 a little bit just a little 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.680
 so you can accept the fact that he 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.120
 there may be sometime 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.880
 very useful thing 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.770
 The clip here is very interesting looking 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.200
 these are not the small dimensions of a knife 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.330
 knife enough dimensional enough 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.730
 big enough so weighty 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.080
 this knife on his pocket practically no 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.350
 it is felt at what is very 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.480
 the right knife doesn't actually look out 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.840
 out of pocket because he 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:28.370
 so a little bit bad and let's say 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.460
 arm thickness here is almost 14 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.260
 13:09 millimeters to be exact he 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.300
 absolutely comfortable located in 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.050
 my pocket doesnâ€™t bother me at all 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:41.540
 made no comments 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:44.210
 awesome so seeming at first 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.340
 look such an unequal knife but very 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.910
 interesting and said today this here 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.800
 handle 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.950
 I think it would be just perfect 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:55.460
 such a tactical moon who is difficult 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:59.860
 call because it cuts awesome but 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:01.810
 such a tactical knife otherwise whole 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.400
 impression of him 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.530
 basically basically positive 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.960
 me this knife by and large 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.300
 liked but again I do not like such 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.880
 big knives this secondly this 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.440
 the handle me is a little embarrassed and kind 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.450
 this structure except that 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.580
 process these edges here anyway 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:23.450
 here this protrusion he will interfere 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:26.300
 personally he bothers me when took the first time 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:29.240
 can grandchildren immediately satio arose here with 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:32.270
 so here is monique himself 20 is dear to him 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:35.450
 also did you do notches takshaka 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:39.590
 this knife you see yes and notches 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:41.900
 very similar interesting too he is very 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:44.090
 so held well in hand but when 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.160
 all with this here is his protrusion 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:49.280
 also present it does not interfere 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.230
 It does not work so that this knife is just 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.850
 under my palm, that is, with clubs, here 

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:57.080
 clearly falls into this hole and this 

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:59.350
 cusp between fingers 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.730
 that is, no one discomfort here 

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:03.560
 a little bit they didnâ€™t calculate I donâ€™t know 

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:06.230
 be not taken under any thin fingers 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:09.820
 two fingers don't fit here 

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:12.770
 one finger gets here and this finger 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:14.960
 gets a very serious burden from 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:17.200
 this acute angle this is not for me 

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.200
 liked 

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:26.789
 Well, in principle, especially so something else to say 

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:29.430
 for this knife i can't reviews for this 

00:07:26.789 --> 00:07:34.500
 abound with the knife I just expressed my 

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:36.000
 such a short opinion such obvious cons 

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:39.719
 which this knife has 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.150
 the rest is all basically possible here 

00:07:39.719 --> 00:07:46.199
 say this knife is very positive 

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:49.080
 very pleasant and actually consists of 

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:50.389
 the pros if I say again not keen 

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:53.669
 by hand 

00:07:50.389 --> 00:07:55.740
 it is personal to just such and 

00:07:53.669 --> 00:07:57.270
 also dimensions this is personal for just 

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:59.940
 someone size does not matter 

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:01.979
 so the only negative is 

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:04.860
 take such a strange ending though many 

00:08:01.979 --> 00:08:06.599
 people are happy to use and grow young from 

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.979
 This knife and say that absolutely not 

00:08:06.599 --> 00:08:12.210
 it hinders the handle 

00:08:07.979 --> 00:08:14.250
 Well, that is what is here 

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:17.150
 interesting little legs everyone thanks for all 

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.150
 attention yet
