00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
 galera giving continuity and a video that 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.889
 I promised famous but I just did not go 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.719
 doing because you had other things there 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:15.000
 can see in the previous video in good that I 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.480
 rolÃª showed it comes here wants to make a 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.910
 circus had to make a 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.560
 a source of promising votes 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.410
 circuit'll bet for you circuit 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:33.149
 occurred on a website 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:37.050
 I ended up doing him here, executive with 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:40.920
 the transistor voltage regulator there 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.140
 oh just what happens with the staff commented 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.649
 that it is microwave it is not 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.870
 advisable to use for this type of 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.610
 source when used too long, do not 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.559
 because the primary return flow 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.300
 it is very high and it gets very hot 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:00.870
 really when I went to do the test 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:14.220
 really 500 angled it using 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:16.820
 primary then call them having fun and 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.680
 will have a low primary competitor 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.820
 low sea and has a lot of winding is a 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.130
 thin and will come out in approximately 18 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.220
 flights and making the following team 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.430
 can control the voltage to reach 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.680
 14.4 or 300 depending on the 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.390
 circuit that your call 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:50.280
 as those of others there at the exit of the 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:59.549
 12 of the regulator 14 it Reference 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:02:03.360
 what happens is a nobreak is strong and 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:08.729
 I think you can pull a 30 and 50 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:12.229
 Calm down. 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.229
 has to enlarge a little 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.830
 for these players here alone who 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.570
 I'll put on a heavy load and I will not 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.560
 this indicator the issue of disseminating 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.480
 computers 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.140
 You have to put the fan on 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.640
 What happens? I ended up doing just that. 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.430
 the staff ends up asking some 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.800
 things that I did wrong in the 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.270
 beginning as I am beast I am not 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.020
 professional 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:44.880
 I did it wrong and ended up studying and poison and 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:47.580
 such and graphics here to explain 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.210
 personal already knows personal beauty that does not 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:54.660
 It 's good, this part happens to 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:59.210
 voltage coming from the house 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:02.310
 She's the only goal that happens is alternated. 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:06.480
 there first question won measure 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:09.120
 220 volts in the last and only in the 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:23.150
 reality the peak attention is not 20 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:27.180
 is 310 because the value rs that the value 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:32.420
 request for a peak value 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:44.610
 / the winner is what it means 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:47.280
 that in most of them the majority of the team 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:52.860
 only this kind of tension that your 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:55.800
 dividing the value given different attention 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.540
 of the world at the last minute but there it is 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.400
 story for another video who knows where 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:05.430
 I explain the difference when 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:12.690
 changes the wave a lot here in ms 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:19.950
 he may not pay attention to what she has 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:22.460
 that's square she's cute that 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.460
 happens 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.040
 in the increase of tension fell from a bridge 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.330
 home rectifier wants the current 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.970
 continuous right 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.490
 after the bridge with the wave rectifier 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:40.210
 complete the attention stay this way here 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:42.160
 It is true that it is normal for 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.720
 only break with four gold one 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:05:02.620
 indicator bridge if I were to use 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:05:04.210
 only two gold get lost can 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.810
 gain or loss 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:10.510
 in the case of electronic power and 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.490
 such that it is a current that is a 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:17.140
 more cute continuous current 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:25.720
 using complete that happens only here 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:31.360
 in when we identify the one there is a 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:42.310
 capacitor then at first she that 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:47.440
 wave with the wines that happens in the case 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:51.850
 he uploaded download uploads this 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:06:05.860
 here is the alternating component changing 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:06:11.340
 direct current with continuous wave 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:15.010
 much bigger 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:19.720
 I use it so I looked studying at 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:23.200
 more or less identified internet 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:26.110
 so I've been left with something from a 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:29.680
 dangerous thousand apps if it goes like this with the foot 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:35.220
 I use 5000 I do not even know the value of r 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.220
 because it gives good is that so 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:47.660
 stronger and 45 helps to take as 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.800
 call to see if it will get hot do 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.800
 another video with the tests come
