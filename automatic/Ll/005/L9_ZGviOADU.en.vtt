that's so cool you can fill up with

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.960 
that's so cool you can fill up with
water<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:12.120> think

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.300 

and<00:02:18.110> they're<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.260> next<00:02:19.380> there's<00:02:19.830> separate

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
and they're the next there's separate

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.930 
and they're the next there's separate
that's<00:02:20.520> good<00:02:21.140> like<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.200> patch<00:02:22.700> comes<00:02:23.700> up<00:02:23.850> you

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
that's good like a patch comes up you

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.130 
that's good like a patch comes up you
can<00:02:23.970> have<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.300> slide<00:02:24.600> on<00:02:24.810> it

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
can have to slide on it

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.920 
can have to slide on it
they<00:02:25.320> look<00:02:25.470> around<00:02:28.310> um<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.850> it<00:02:30.450> separates

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
they look around um and it separates

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.540 
they look around um and it separates
like<00:02:31.200> that<00:02:31.380> already<00:02:31.680> cool<00:02:33.560> so<00:02:34.560> I<00:02:34.830> was<00:02:35.430> looking

like that already cool so I was looking

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.120 
like that already cool so I was looking
like<00:02:35.880> I<00:02:36.060> turn<00:02:36.270> about<00:02:36.540> with<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.840> puck<00:02:37.050> but<00:02:37.770> I

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
like I turn about with the puck but I

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:54.920
