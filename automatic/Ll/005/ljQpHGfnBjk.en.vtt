00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.650
 when we buy a frozen product and we must be guaranteed 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.650
 from the long cold chain 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.750
 the bed and the transport and the last link of the various passages the industry of the 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.210
 frozen products 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.669
 makes the most of cold application 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.630
 using first quality products that euro 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.029
 can be collected or directly from the field in the case of plant products 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.059
 or be processed directly in the farm ships 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.690
 at the time of fishing 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.900
 so we can have any kind of news fish product we talk about 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.820
 twinavi farm ships 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.210
 immediately dismissed when caught 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.979
 after which the whole cold chain must be dressed 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:53.370
 preserved hey 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.840
 these products must always remain at the temperature 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.840
 lower aim - 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.170
 18 photo because their organoleptic characteristics lend 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.390
 perfectly 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.780
 before the thesis we will have a product on our table 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.850
 as if he had been fishing immediately 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.830
 what risks we run when the cold chain is interrupted by torraca 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.570
 walls was for example 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.370
 and think 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.640
 singing when 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.810
 hdl disconnected the current certainly not for girls to our wanting the housewives that 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.160
 case they ask 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.820
 what to do xd all these stocks consume all omg 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.110
 first of all, then 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.690
 you always need to turn preventively 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.720
 a fundamental thing is to put a minimum and maximum thermometer inside the 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.630
 frizzart not so much over the products but alongside 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.110
 the way to realize if 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.220
 home appliance has lost temperature and therefore the products may alter into 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.230
 somehow 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.920
 keep in mind that the microbes find a considerable difficulty grew 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.469
 temperatures below -10 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:05.979
 the organoleptic characteristics of the product are lost when 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.170
 and we start to go up in temperature already -14- 13-12 we have some 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.129
 temperatures that 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:17.529
 they cause the aggregation of water crystals and therefore products no longer have 

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:19.019
 those features 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.979
 perfect as when they were fished immediately frozen 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:28.229
 the thermometer will allow us to see if temperatures have risen following me 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:29.120
 these products 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.849
 may have changed 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.930
 in case the temperature has risen too much and we went to 3 4 5 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.230
 10 degrees here then they could also begin to grow 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.540
 certain microbes and the product is better than the table there are indications 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.459
 precise storage conditions for these products 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.319
 all stanhome products 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.919
 and on the box with all the information given by the manufacturer 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.209
 villa the factor we say 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.329
 variable rt frizzano of our house 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:04.319
 which will have a series of little stars to indicate the temperature it maintains 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.549
 the producer will tell us depending on the stars of our frizzart how much 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.109
 we can hold 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:16.369
 conservatory within that period use it for the crops according to her 

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:21.869
 it is better to thaw at room temperature or use the lim is 

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:23.549
 from the to go faster 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:24.969
 twitter banks 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:29.899
 depending on the products we can behave differently than it usually is 

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:33.150
 the also in this case the producer who gives indications of the case 

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:38.519
 we have for example very small products a man who have been a lot 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.879
 usually the crop is fragmented 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:44.920
 it must be made immediately without thawing and remember and peas 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.720
 the example that should be thrown in boiling water cooked immediately or 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.920
 in hamburg and that must be put on the plate directly from frozen food 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.909
 in the case of meat, surely the microwave is not recommended because it causes 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:58.360
 already a start of 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.750
 almost boiling and therefore decarninne it was integral it is better to thaw them 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.020
 refrigerator but always reported by the label and by what is there 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.290
 written on the cool box hey the producer chessa actually like the 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.660
 its product must be used to the best of the consumer to have the 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.680
 maximum of features that that product. 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:23.289
 and consumers when to buy 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:27.629
 happybet using the thermal bag you are exactly the most 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.309
 but above all Neapolitan here, 

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:34.020
 door-to-door oral sex 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.690
 have one always at hand maybe linda 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:41.020
 car will make you comfortable mind 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.639
 it will guarantee the food that it should carry up to home especially 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.069
 in the season and warm 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:51.559
 even transportation from the supermarket to the home is really
