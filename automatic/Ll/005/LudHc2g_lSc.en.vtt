don't know why it's missing from that
build<00:03:29.400> because<00:03:30.400> it<00:03:30.670> really<00:03:30.880> saves<00:03:31.180> a<00:03:31.300> lot<00:03:31.390> of

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
battery life I don't use 3g all the time

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.560 
battery life I don't use 3g all the time
I<00:03:34.240> only<00:03:34.780> have<00:03:35.020> it<00:03:35.170> on<00:03:35.320> whenever<00:03:35.590> I<00:03:35.800> need<00:03:36.100> it<00:03:36.130> to

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
I only have it on whenever I need it to

I only have it on whenever I need it to
but<00:03:37.570> with<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:37.840> ji<00:03:38.110> 6<00:03:38.530> build<00:03:38.800> like<00:03:39.130> I<00:03:39.280> said<00:03:39.550> you

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
but with the ji 6 build like I said you

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.510 
but with the ji 6 build like I said you
get<00:03:39.880> a<00:03:39.910> better<00:03:40.209> data<00:03:41.200> connection<00:03:41.890> but<00:03:42.280> with

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
get a better data connection but with

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.600 
get a better data connection but with
the<00:03:42.640> ji<00:03:42.850> to<00:03:43.030> you<00:03:43.390> save<00:03:43.660> battery<00:03:44.050> life<00:03:44.110> and<00:03:44.610> I

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
the ji to you save battery life and I

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.910 
the ji to you save battery life and I
think<00:03:45.940> battery<00:03:46.209> life<00:03:46.450> is<00:03:46.480> better<00:03:46.870> than<00:03:47.170> the

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
think battery life is better than the

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.920 
think battery life is better than the
data<00:03:48.130> connection<00:03:49.110> so<00:03:51.180> you<00:03:52.180> didn't<00:03:52.390> change<00:03:52.540> too

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
data connection so you didn't change too

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.690 
data connection so you didn't change too
much<00:03:52.959> about<00:03:53.410> this<00:03:53.590> ROM<00:03:53.860> so<00:03:53.890> I'm<00:03:54.370> not<00:03:54.520> going<00:03:54.640> to

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
difference between 2.1 and 2.2 is but he

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.230 
difference between 2.1 and 2.2 is but he
said<00:04:20.170> he<00:04:20.320> installed<00:04:20.680> a<00:04:20.770> 2.2<00:04:21.340> version<00:04:21.370> of<00:04:22.060> the
