lay their eggs and while they're doing

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.999 
lay their eggs and while they're doing
that<00:04:53.939> they're<00:04:54.180> very<00:04:54.360> easy<00:04:54.569> to<00:04:54.750> target<00:04:55.009> anymore

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:56.009 
that they're very easy to target anymore

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:57.770 
that they're very easy to target anymore
think<00:04:56.340> it's<00:04:56.460> bad<00:04:56.639> for<00:04:56.939> us<00:04:57.180> going<00:04:57.449> out<00:04:57.629> and

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
think it's bad for us going out and

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.939 
think it's bad for us going out and
targeting<00:04:58.139> a<00:04:58.199> species<00:04:58.620> while<00:04:58.770> they're

00:04:58.939 --> 00:04:58.949 
targeting a species while they're

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:01.100 
targeting a species while they're
breeding<00:04:59.159> and<00:04:59.430> laying<00:04:59.610> eggs<00:04:59.819> but<00:05:00.780> you're<00:05:00.930> told

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
breeding and laying eggs but you're told

by<00:05:01.319> the<00:05:01.379> number<00:05:01.680> of<00:05:01.710> eggs<00:05:01.860> that<00:05:01.949> are<00:05:02.099> out<00:05:02.189> there

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
by the number of eggs that are out there

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.649 
by the number of eggs that are out there
these<00:05:02.550> things<00:05:02.909> have<00:05:03.060> already<00:05:03.300> had<00:05:03.419> a<00:05:03.449> good

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:03.659 
these things have already had a good

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:05.240 
these things have already had a good
crack<00:05:03.870> at<00:05:04.020> breeding<00:05:04.349> and<00:05:04.500> they<00:05:04.979> literally

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
crack at breeding and they literally

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.429 
crack at breeding and they literally
only<00:05:05.520> live<00:05:05.759> for<00:05:05.909> a<00:05:05.939> year<00:05:06.000> so<00:05:06.419> basically<00:05:07.139> once

00:05:07.429 --> 00:05:07.439 
only live for a year so basically once

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:08.330 
only live for a year so basically once
they've<00:05:07.590> laid<00:05:07.740> their<00:05:07.889> eggs<00:05:07.919> they're<00:05:08.219> just

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
they've laid their eggs they're just

great eating corn is gonna cook some of

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:15.140 
great eating corn is gonna cook some of
these<00:05:13.469> up<00:05:13.680> later<00:05:13.830> they're<00:05:14.580> quite<00:05:14.819> easy<00:05:14.849> to

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
these up later they're quite easy to

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.610 
these up later they're quite easy to
shoot<00:05:15.389> when<00:05:15.569> they're<00:05:15.719> breeding<00:05:15.870> like<00:05:16.440> they

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
shoot when they're breeding like they

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.260 
shoot when they're breeding like they
are<00:05:16.680> then<00:05:16.949> there's<00:05:17.129> a<00:05:17.190> bag<00:05:17.370> limit<00:05:17.669> of<00:05:17.759> 10<00:05:18.000> so

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
are then there's a bag limit of 10 so

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.909 
are then there's a bag limit of 10 so
they'll<00:05:18.750> three<00:05:18.960> of<00:05:19.050> us<00:05:19.169> diving<00:05:19.530> we<00:05:19.650> could<00:05:19.830> have

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
they'll three of us diving we could have

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.920 
they'll three of us diving we could have
got<00:05:20.039> 30<00:05:20.310> but<00:05:20.789> what's<00:05:21.060> the<00:05:21.120> point<00:05:21.300> in<00:05:21.449> that<00:05:21.569> we

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
got 30 but what's the point in that we

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.050 
got 30 but what's the point in that we
went<00:05:22.080> out<00:05:22.169> we<00:05:22.259> got<00:05:22.379> dyke<00:05:22.620> ten<00:05:22.860> between<00:05:23.190> us<00:05:23.340> if

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
went out we got dyke ten between us if

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.339 
went out we got dyke ten between us if
they're<00:05:24.180> pretty<00:05:24.300> Placid<00:05:24.780> you<00:05:24.870> can<00:05:24.990> just<00:05:25.139> speed

00:05:34.369 --> 00:05:34.379 
aiming at the largest surface area if

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:36.290 
aiming at the largest surface area if
they're<00:05:34.560> a<00:05:34.590> bit<00:05:34.800> more<00:05:34.979> standoffish<00:05:35.370> dive<00:05:36.120> down

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300
