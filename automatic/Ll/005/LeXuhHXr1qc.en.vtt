00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:13.289 
begin with this match it felt like a war

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:15.049 
begin with this match it felt like a war
from<00:00:13.500> start<00:00:13.709> to<00:00:13.770> finish<00:00:14.039> yeah<00:00:14.580> it<00:00:14.730> was<00:00:14.820> always

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
from start to finish yeah it was always

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.000 
from start to finish yeah it was always
gonna<00:00:15.209> be<00:00:15.360> like<00:00:15.480> that<00:00:15.629> I<00:00:15.660> think<00:00:15.860> not<00:00:16.860> because

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
gonna be like that I think not because

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.529 
gonna be like that I think not because
it's<00:00:17.310> pick<00:00:17.550> Portland<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.060> Seattle<00:00:18.210> but<00:00:18.480> i

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
it's pick Portland and Seattle but i

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.480 
it's pick Portland and Seattle but i
think<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:19.289> standard<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.980> two<00:00:20.160> teams<00:00:20.369> that

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
think the standard of the two teams that

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.850 
think the standard of the two teams that
they've<00:00:20.699> said<00:00:20.880> so<00:00:21.030> far<00:00:21.210> this<00:00:21.360> season<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.930> I

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:22.860 
they've said so far this season and I

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:23.810 
they've said so far this season and I
think<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.160> know<00:00:23.190> there<00:00:23.370> was<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.490> lot<00:00:23.610> said

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
think you know there was a lot said

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:24.860 
think you know there was a lot said
before<00:00:24.030> the<00:00:24.090> game<00:00:24.120> about<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.450> plays<00:00:24.690> they

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:24.870 
before the game about the plays they

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.360 
before the game about the plays they
were<00:00:24.990> missing<00:00:25.290> but<00:00:25.590> if<00:00:25.710> you<00:00:25.830> look<00:00:25.920> at<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.100> team

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:26.370 
were missing but if you look at the team

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.100 
were missing but if you look at the team
that<00:00:26.970> we<00:00:27.150> had<00:00:27.390> out<00:00:27.539> there<00:00:27.570> was<00:00:27.870> a<00:00:27.930> lot<00:00:28.080> of

Fishlock<00:00:42.630> flying<00:00:43.560> across<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.950> pond<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.820> think

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
Fishlock flying across the pond I think

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.700 
Fishlock flying across the pond I think
you<00:00:45.570> know<00:00:45.690> credit<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.170> players<00:00:46.380> i<00:00:46.560> thought

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
you know credit to the players i thought

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.110 
you know credit to the players i thought
they<00:00:46.800> dug<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.160> wasn't<00:00:47.760> our<00:00:47.820> best<00:00:47.850> performance

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
they dug in wasn't our best performance

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.729 
they dug in wasn't our best performance
I<00:00:48.720> didn't<00:00:48.960> think<00:00:48.989> we<00:00:49.170> were<00:00:49.230> played<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.620> well

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
I didn't think we were played that well

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.650 
I didn't think we were played that well
but<00:00:50.489> we<00:00:50.700> got<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.940> result<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.420> sought<00:00:51.630> to

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
but we got the result and that sought to

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.450 
but we got the result and that sought to
me<00:00:51.809> what<00:00:51.960> matters<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.470> know<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.590> think<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
me what matters you know I think the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.620 
me what matters you know I think the
port<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.760> we'll<00:00:53.850> probably<00:00:54.000> disappointed

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.630 
port and we'll probably disappointed

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.330 
port and we'll probably disappointed
that<00:00:54.870> they<00:00:54.960> didn't<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.500> get<00:00:55.800> points<00:00:56.130> out<00:00:56.219> of

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
that they didn't and get points out of

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.150 
that they didn't and get points out of
the<00:00:56.399> game<00:00:56.579> Nick<00:00:57.510> maybe<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.809> tie<00:00:58.440> probably<00:00:59.040> would

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
the game Nick maybe a tie probably would

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.830 
the game Nick maybe a tie probably would
have<00:00:59.219> been<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.370> fair<00:00:59.579> result<00:00:59.730> but<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.300> think

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
have been a fair result but I think

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.209 
have been a fair result but I think
credit<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.200> our<00:01:01.230> players<00:01:01.559> they<00:01:01.710> never<00:01:01.890> stop

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
credit to our players they never stop

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.920 
credit to our players they never stop
and<00:01:02.460> when<00:01:02.790> you've<00:01:02.910> got<00:01:03.059> plays<00:01:03.329> new<00:01:03.510> team<00:01:03.750> like

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
and when you've got plays new team like

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.660 
and when you've got plays new team like
Kim<00:01:04.140> little<00:01:04.409> you'll<00:01:04.920> always<00:01:05.100> get<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.369> chance

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
Kim little you'll always get a chance

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.510 
Kim little you'll always get a chance
and<00:01:05.909> she<00:01:06.600> had<00:01:06.719> probably<00:01:07.200> two<00:01:07.649> very<00:01:08.040> very<00:01:08.159> good

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520

chances today and she finishes one of
them<00:01:10.439> off<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:10.979> that's<00:01:11.280> why<00:01:11.490> she's<00:01:11.670> world

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.300 
think you know we doomed an odd about
playing<00:02:52.750> Kim<00:02:52.989> higher<00:02:53.170> up<00:02:53.440> prior<00:02:53.799> to<00:02:53.829> the<00:02:54.129> game

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
playing Kim higher up prior to the game

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.039 
playing Kim higher up prior to the game

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
and then your officers a game progressed

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.830 
and then your officers a game progressed
and<00:02:56.349> that's<00:02:56.980> why<00:02:57.190> she's<00:02:57.970> good<00:02:58.209> to<00:02:58.420> be<00:02:58.540> able<00:02:58.629> to

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
and that's why she's good to be able to

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.690 
and that's why she's good to be able to
play<00:02:58.959> up<00:02:59.140> there<00:02:59.260> because<00:02:59.470> she<00:02:59.799> goes<00:03:00.099> great

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
disrespect to any of the girls we had

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.099 
disrespect to any of the girls we had
last<00:03:21.190> year<00:03:21.400> but<00:03:21.790> when<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.629> chips<00:03:22.660> are<00:03:23.049> down

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
last year but when the chips are down

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.229 
last year but when the chips are down
when<00:03:23.739> we<00:03:23.769> don't<00:03:23.950> play<00:03:24.220> well<00:03:24.459> we<00:03:24.700> can<00:03:24.880> grind<00:03:25.060> out

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
when we don't play well we can grind out

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.180 
when we don't play well we can grind out
resorts<00:03:25.630> and<00:03:25.810> and<00:03:25.930> that's<00:03:26.349> why<00:03:26.620> today<00:03:26.889> was

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
resorts and and that's why today was

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.259 
resorts and and that's why today was
probably<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:27.549> most<00:03:27.669> pleasing<00:03:27.970> so<00:03:28.060> I<00:03:28.090> didn't

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
probably the most pleasing so I didn't

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.840 
probably the most pleasing so I didn't
think<00:03:28.419> I<00:03:28.450> played<00:03:28.569> that<00:03:28.630> well
