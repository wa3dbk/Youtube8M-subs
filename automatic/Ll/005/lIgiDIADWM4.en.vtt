00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.790
 very good to all people I am a machine 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.640
 welcome to a new guild video 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:09.700
 wars 2 look at my ashura piece that 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.550
 I have with the armor this is the 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.559
 cultural armor of rank 3 I think 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.880
 the most incredible armor of the game 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:21.519
 You know what's perfect is left of God 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.019
 you are amazing I would need to change 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:24.279
 a little about the sword the corner 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.050
 because there are some that are very cool 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.149
 but good little by little 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.039
 good in griquas all you know 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:32.079
 I do not play very often but I've 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.699
 entered because as you know now what of 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.109
 the story works in such a way that 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:37.660
 when you put on a new patch with a 

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:39.309
 new chapter if you do not enter then 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.679
 you will have to turn it off then why not 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.730
 it costs nothing to go look at it 

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:44.589
 look at the chapter even if 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.999
 unblock him so you already have it in this 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:49.300
 I want to do it whole I'm going to 

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:52.829
 teach and well nothing we go there we are going to 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.829
 start to see where to go 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.250
 to the grove is worth this I already saw it in the 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.600
 test server so surely 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.660
 this is what I cut because it's just 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.800
 talk and well nothing now we will go for 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.260
 there 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.000
 I do not know if you'll remember the end of 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.040
 first history of guild wars 2 the 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.500
 last trailer that came out at the end of the 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.990
 trailer was done as a tour of 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.520
 Map of warm up to what 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.250
 it was the eye of a dragon and there it 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.070
 they closed this as I imagined it was 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.619
 a great clue about the next story 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.390
 which we are living now and in this 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.310
 history this dragon is waking up 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.820
 and surely he will be the villain 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.810
 end of the second season now 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.399
 for the moment, it is only 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.990
 waking up we know that there is 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:37.880
 is waking up and that is dangerous and 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.530
 Therefore, many of his servants 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.910
 are starting to move around the map and 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.070
 with it, they are appearing a lot 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.560
 of new problems between races and so on 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.899
 the goal therefore here is to join another 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.610
 once to all races and try to 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.259
 so that they make a pineapple to be able 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.750
 face this dragon that I imagine 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.759
 It will take a long time to appear 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.920
 definitely in let's say what chapters 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.090
 already at the end but good for now 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.369
 update are a lot of events 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.380
 linked together is like a chain of 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.210
 events quite long the story itself 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.350
 It is not very long but as there is a lot 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.090
 of events to do and they are taking you 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.619
 side by side of warm thing that I 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.100
 I like it a lot because there were areas that 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.800
 mick and 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.870
 I was met as areas of other fats 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.590
 good is the story is the chapter it 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.300
 it's quite long 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.500
 remember that once you complete the 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.930
 chapter then you can return it to 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.849
 complete to achieve achievements and 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.430
 rewards there is a pretty reward 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.379
 cool that are some chests that go 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.180
 appearing randomly on the map and 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.340
 that give you the ability to get 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.900
 an object that makes you move more 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.730
 quick I can be out of combat is 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.790
 one of the sites I think more subtle of 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.730
 this chapter and good for a little longer 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.049
 more personally I think that the 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.660
 made to take out every two weeks a 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:48.239
 pretty interesting update on 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.459
 the story is something that I recognize that 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.650
 it's a good job from arenanet but to me 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.239
 personally as you know then as 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.220
 I just said a moment ago and I guess 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.069
 that you already know about other videos because 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.750
 the theme of the mpg's story is no 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.640
 It is not very strong game average basis 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.110
 suddenly for its history and clear as 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.480
 that spending is focused a lot on the 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.829
 history because that's why I guess it's the 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.540
 main reason why I have not 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.120
 hooked the game and do not play it all 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.440
 the days still like that I would like that 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.970
 in the comments you told me your 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.069
 opinions about what you like and what we 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.510
 like to continue uasd I'm going to start myself and 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.670
 the truth is that I have to admit that 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.250
 lately all the mpg is that I'm 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.380
 playing and clear when you look at an axis 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.300
 you have to create your character starting 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.850
 to level up, in all those that 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.520
 I've been playing lately of them 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.830
 cool online corts be ad age the 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.840
 game expansion even all these 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.420
 enemy fish that I'm playing when 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.580
 I begin to relieve my character echo of 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.770
 less a lot the video system of 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.740
 guild wars 2 but always I start to 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.750
 release and I say good I wish I had the 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.180
 x video system expenses the theme of 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.030
 the dynamic events that man 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.709
 logically when beams and several 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.510
 times because it is not as dynamic as 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.459
 it seems at the beginning but that of al 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.530
 principle of stopping of not having 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.989
 missions and move around the map 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.400
 doing 22 I loved the whole topic 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:09.349
 of the challenges as a plan went up 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.329
 to a mountain to catch a view or 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.849
 make a skill point all that 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:16.639
 it seemed good as a whole the best 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:18.410
 evelyn system of any mpg that 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.019
 I have played and not only the system of 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.479
 I see him but also the philosophy of 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.280
 game that is to be rewarded both in the 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.960
 cooperativity among the players that 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.880
 you can be doing an event 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.530
 although there are a lot of bugs and that 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.090
 all absolutely everyone gives you 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.530
 experience even if you're not in to bring and 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.030
 be in a group with the other players 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.800
 that's something that I love and that also 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.690
 you can block them and so on 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.430
 other smaller things but when 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.830
 you do not have them you throw them a lot 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.900
 missing as for example the button of the 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.030
 guild wars 2 inventory that tells you 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.740
 take the collectibles to the bank something 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.690
 as basic as that is something that 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.090
 I miss almost everything, it pissed me rps 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.160
 but as I tell you once you get to 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.110
 maximum level in the wash all as the 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.050
 game focused a lot on the story in 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.240
 making achievements and knowing better 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.889
 skins and such and from my point of view 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.610
 it is not something that motivates me to 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:09.430
 play it too for example would motivate me 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:12.550
 have sands in plan 2 against 2 3 against 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.439
 3 5 against 5 that the pvp team does not 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.789
 was for all the same but that then 

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:17.889
 although it is very important that 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:20.379
 have to play daily for 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:21.729
 get it that way because it would encourage me to 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:23.710
 enter every day and I will try to go 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:26.080
 thus improving my character with better 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.719
 objects improve more and better armors 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.669
 enchantments and so on for the 

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:33.610
 pvp and as for the gdp that is true 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:34.960
 I'm more of pvp but I guess the 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.699
 that are more than pvp are missing 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.770
 Content of root content that 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:40.529
 you need strategy and you need 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:44.560
 then enter every week at least 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:46.210
 me that I know five hours to be able to do 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.009
 the weekly raid content and be able to go 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.389
 getting better equipment also the 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:50.949
 theme of team progression so much 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.259
 in pvp with but I think it's the most 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:54.759
 important in 12 million fish 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:56.889
 normally he usually engages in the subject of 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:59.199
 to make your character better 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:01.449
 if your character is not doing better 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:05.139
 in the case of expenses it is seen above all 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:06.759
 The pp does not hook as much as other 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:08.289
 games but good as I tell you the game 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:10.029
 let's say I like a lot but not 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:12.039
 I was hooked so I'm still bringing videos 

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:13.540
 from time to time and all new 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:15.370
 features that go away 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.990
 in plan for example the update of 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.760
 day 15 that brought a lot of news 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.470
 Well, I'm going to do all that 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.150
 transforming into video and I could continue 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.320
 informing about the game so nothing 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.090
 more people I hope you also leave me 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.650
 your impressions about the game in 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.600
 the comments what do you think that you 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.610
 I wish he had no guild 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.330
 wars 2 and see you in the next video 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.330
 see you later
