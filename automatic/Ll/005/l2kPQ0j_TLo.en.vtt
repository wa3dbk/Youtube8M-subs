nearly massive enough to be a brown

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.719 
nearly massive enough to be a brown

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
dwarf so the odds are pretty good that

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.730

that there's no fusion going on inside
it<00:02:25.060> now<00:02:25.300> I'm<00:02:25.510> a<00:02:25.540> fan<00:02:25.840> of<00:02:25.870> calling<00:02:26.710> this<00:02:26.830> a<00:02:26.890> rogue

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
it now I'm a fan of calling this a rogue

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.980 
it now I'm a fan of calling this a rogue

hand the word rogue is kind of
problematic<00:02:37.570> in<00:02:37.840> that<00:02:37.960> it<00:02:38.050> gets<00:02:38.200> people

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
problematic in that it gets people
