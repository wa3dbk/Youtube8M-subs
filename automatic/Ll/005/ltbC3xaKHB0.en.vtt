00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.359 
came out you know what was it a year or
two<00:01:31.850> before<00:01:32.469> the<00:01:33.469> only<00:01:33.740> difference<00:01:34.070> for<00:01:34.250> it

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
two before the only difference for it

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.870 
two before the only difference for it
however<00:01:35.179> is<00:01:35.509> that<00:01:35.539> the<00:01:36.350> arm<00:01:36.920> or<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:37.340> hands<00:01:37.670> are

so<00:02:21.290> it's<00:02:21.470> accessory<00:02:21.980> time<00:02:22.280> and<00:02:22.549> now<00:02:22.640> we're

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
so it's accessory time and now we're

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.650 
so it's accessory time and now we're
just<00:02:22.970> gonna<00:02:23.090> show<00:02:23.840> everything

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
just gonna show everything

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.540 
just gonna show everything
it's<00:02:24.810> slightly<00:02:25.500> different<00:02:26.040> from<00:02:26.250> the

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
it's slightly different from the

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.660 
it's slightly different from the
original<00:02:27.360> version<00:02:27.720> of<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.110> GPO<00:02:28.470> -<00:02:28.670> the

original version of the GPO - the

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.880 
original version of the GPO - the
biggest<00:02:30.000> change<00:02:30.300> is<00:02:30.600> of<00:02:30.900> one<00:02:31.140> of<00:02:31.290> one<00:02:31.710> of<00:02:31.800> the

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
biggest change is of one of one of the

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.680 
biggest change is of one of one of the
biggest<00:02:32.040> changes<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.970> actual<00:02:33.450> shield

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
biggest changes is the actual shield

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.040 
biggest changes is the actual shield
itself<00:02:34.260> no<00:02:34.920> longer<00:02:34.950> do<00:02:35.640> these<00:02:36.060> top<00:02:36.420> pieces<00:02:36.690> of

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
itself no longer do these top pieces of

the<00:02:37.200> shield<00:02:37.440> swivel<00:02:38.070> out<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:39.360> whole

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
the shield swivel out and the whole

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.810 
the shield swivel out and the whole
plastic<00:02:40.140> or<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:40.890> whole<00:02:41.040> shield<00:02:41.280> is<00:02:41.430> one<00:02:41.610> big

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
plastic or the whole shield is one big

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.230 
plastic or the whole shield is one big
plastic<00:02:42.300> mold<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:43.650> inside<00:02:44.220> is<00:02:44.640> I<00:02:44.970> guess<00:02:45.210> a

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
plastic mold the inside is I guess a

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.970 
plastic mold the inside is I guess a
little<00:02:45.450> bit<00:02:45.690> different<00:02:46.080> but<00:02:46.260> nothing<00:02:46.800> really

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
little bit different but nothing really

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.100 
little bit different but nothing really
has<00:02:47.190> changed<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:47.820> it<00:02:48.270> does<00:02:48.420> share<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.870> same

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
has changed and it does share the same

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.890 
has changed and it does share the same
color<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.560> pattern<00:02:50.340> change<00:02:50.700> that<00:02:51.030> also<00:02:51.360> occurs

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
color a pattern change that also occurs

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.290 
color a pattern change that also occurs
on<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.140> figure<00:02:52.470> as<00:02:52.590> well<00:02:52.770> let's<00:02:53.760> put<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:54.150> to

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
on the figure as well let's put that to

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.470 
on the figure as well let's put that to
the<00:02:54.360> side<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:55.170> of<00:02:56.010> course<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.670> shield<00:02:57.060> does

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
the side and of course the shield does

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.610 
the side and of course the shield does
house<00:02:57.780> these<00:02:58.140> two<00:02:58.470> are<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:59.430> bazooka<00:03:00.620> the

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
house these two are the bazooka the

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.060 
house these two are the bazooka the
longer<00:03:01.920> end<00:03:02.100> of<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.340> bazooka<00:03:02.820> which<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:04.230> back

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
longer end of the bazooka which the back

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.700 
longer end of the bazooka which the back
Animas<00:03:05.670> of<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.060> bazooka<00:03:06.600> attaches<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.470> the

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
Animas of the bazooka attaches to the

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.920 
Animas of the bazooka attaches to the
shoulder<00:03:08.600> with<00:03:09.740> this<00:03:10.740> piece<00:03:11.010> of<00:03:11.190> course

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
shoulder with this piece of course

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.910 
shoulder with this piece of course
connecting<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.020> two<00:03:13.170> will<00:03:13.350> complete<00:03:13.770> them

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
connecting the two will complete them

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.000 
connecting the two will complete them
and<00:03:14.630> oops<00:03:15.630> there<00:03:16.230> we<00:03:16.320> got<00:03:16.470> a<00:03:16.500> full-sized

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
and oops there we got a full-sized

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.540 
and oops there we got a full-sized
bazooka<00:03:18.500> one<00:03:19.500> of<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.680> biggest<00:03:19.950> draws<00:03:20.160> I<00:03:20.340> guess

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
bazooka one of the biggest draws I guess

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.370 
bazooka one of the biggest draws I guess
for<00:03:20.820> this<00:03:21.000> figure<00:03:21.300> is<00:03:21.480> that<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.840> bazooka<00:03:22.200> is

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
for this figure is that the bazooka is

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.800 
for this figure is that the bazooka is
actually<00:03:22.920> able<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.340> fire<00:03:24.120> out<00:03:24.390> a<00:03:24.420> small

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
actually able to fire out a small

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.860 
actually able to fire out a small
missile<00:03:25.290> I<00:03:25.440> just<00:03:25.830> got<00:03:25.980> this<00:03:26.190> in<00:03:26.660> two<00:03:27.660> days<00:03:27.840> ago

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
missile I just got this in two days ago

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.199 
missile I just got this in two days ago
so<00:03:28.530> now<00:03:28.890> I'm<00:03:29.130> gonna<00:03:29.340> test<00:03:29.580> it<00:03:29.760> and<00:03:29.850> see<00:03:30.000> if<00:03:30.120> it

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
so now I'm gonna test it and see if it

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.690 
so now I'm gonna test it and see if it
works<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:30.959> it<00:03:31.590> does<00:03:31.800> and<00:03:32.010> I<00:03:32.070> actually<00:03:32.250> broke

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
works and it does and I actually broke

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.360 
works and it does and I actually broke
the<00:03:32.910> bazooka<00:03:33.450> how<00:03:34.100> sad<00:03:35.100> is<00:03:37.010> one<00:03:38.010> of<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.220> other

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
the bazooka how sad is one of the other

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.070 
the bazooka how sad is one of the other
things<00:03:38.790> is<00:03:39.030> that<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:39.420> still<00:03:39.660> get<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:39.930> two

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
things is that you still get the two

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.490 
things is that you still get the two
beam<00:03:40.320> sabers<00:03:40.860> unlike<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:41.880> version<00:03:42.209> two<00:03:42.500> they

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
beam sabers unlike the version two they

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.710 
beam sabers unlike the version two they
do<00:03:43.560> not<00:03:43.980> fit<00:03:44.370> inside<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:46.100> skirt<00:03:47.100> Armour<00:03:47.720> but

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
do not fit inside the skirt Armour but

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.870 
do not fit inside the skirt Armour but
you<00:03:49.080> I'm<00:03:49.440> sorry<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.800> Japanese<00:03:50.280> version<00:03:50.730> two

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
you I'm sorry the Japanese version two

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.540 
you I'm sorry the Japanese version two
I'm<00:03:51.180> gonna<00:03:52.010> tell<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.100> difference<00:03:53.400> between

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
I'm gonna tell the difference between

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.360 
I'm gonna tell the difference between
the<00:03:53.880> two<00:03:54.030> anyways<00:03:54.720> it<00:03:55.620> doesn't<00:03:55.680> fit<00:03:56.040> into<00:03:56.190> the

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
the two anyways it doesn't fit into the

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.729 
the two anyways it doesn't fit into the
skirt<00:03:56.580> armor<00:03:56.970> but<00:03:57.150> they<00:03:57.270> still<00:03:57.570> detached<00:03:58.530> from

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
skirt armor but they still detached from

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.570 
skirt armor but they still detached from
the<00:03:58.890> hilt<00:03:59.100> so<00:03:59.880> there's<00:04:00.239> that<00:04:01.040> you<00:04:02.040> do<00:04:02.190> get<00:04:02.400> one

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
the hilt so there's that you do get one

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.850 
the hilt so there's that you do get one
extra<00:04:02.790> hand<00:04:03.270> originally<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.380> figure<00:04:04.650> does

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
extra hand originally the figure does

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.390 
extra hand originally the figure does
come<00:04:05.250> with<00:04:05.970> two<00:04:06.300> beam<00:04:06.750> saber<00:04:07.080> hands<00:04:07.380> and<00:04:07.680> then

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
come with two beam saber hands and then

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.920 
come with two beam saber hands and then
you<00:04:09.360> get<00:04:09.570> a<00:04:09.810> whoops<00:04:10.260> came<00:04:10.800> out<00:04:10.980> a<00:04:11.930> trigger

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
you get a whoops came out a trigger

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.949 
you get a whoops came out a trigger
finger<00:04:13.170> hand<00:04:13.580> so<00:04:14.580> now<00:04:15.000> you<00:04:15.060> can<00:04:15.300> have<00:04:15.480> them<00:04:15.630> do

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
finger hand so now you can have them do

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.039 
finger hand so now you can have them do
a<00:04:15.989> double<00:04:16.440> wielding<00:04:17.030> saber<00:04:18.030> action<00:04:18.660> and<00:04:18.900> then

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
a double wielding saber action and then

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.680 
a double wielding saber action and then
you<00:04:19.080> can<00:04:19.530> take<00:04:20.250> the<00:04:20.370> hand<00:04:20.580> off<00:04:20.730> and<00:04:21.000> have<00:04:21.540> them

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
you can take the hand off and have them

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.140 
you can take the hand off and have them
just<00:04:21.870> aiming<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.380> bazooka<00:04:22.860> at<00:04:23.040> whatever<00:04:23.220> but

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
just aiming the bazooka at whatever but

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.110 
just aiming the bazooka at whatever but
that's<00:04:24.660> about<00:04:24.990> all<00:04:25.169> the<00:04:25.890> changes<00:04:26.370> you<00:04:26.550> get<00:04:26.730> and

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
that's about all the changes you get and

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.690 
that's about all the changes you get and
so<00:04:27.930> now<00:04:28.080> we've<00:04:28.320> come<00:04:28.560> to<00:04:28.590> price<00:04:29.010> value<00:04:29.550> and
