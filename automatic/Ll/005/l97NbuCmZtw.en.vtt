not trust I've been justified because
he's<00:04:13.500> really<00:04:13.769> looked<00:04:13.950> after<00:04:14.099> me<00:04:14.370> and<00:04:14.910> I<00:04:14.970> feel

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
he's really looked after me and I feel

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.879 
he's really looked after me and I feel
like<00:04:15.300> I'm<00:04:15.480> part<00:04:15.660> of<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:16.199> mcguigan<00:04:16.590> family

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
like I'm part of the mcguigan family

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.000 
like I'm part of the mcguigan family
that's<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.430> truth<00:04:17.639> you<00:04:17.820> know<00:04:17.910> so<00:04:18.859> no<00:04:19.859> it's<00:04:19.979> not

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
that's the truth you know so no it's not

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.920 
that's the truth you know so no it's not
to<00:04:20.190> do<00:04:20.280> a<00:04:20.310> pin<00:04:20.820> see<00:04:21.000> it's<00:04:21.329> just<00:04:21.479> just<00:04:21.690> a<00:04:21.780> nice

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
to do a pin see it's just just a nice

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:37.600 
to do a pin see it's just just a nice
guy<00:04:21.959> nice<00:04:22.620> guy<00:04:22.770> that's<00:04:23.010> it

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.130 

so<00:04:38.610> I<00:04:38.910> thought<00:04:39.150> why<00:04:39.330> he<00:04:39.390> says<00:04:39.690> a<00:04:39.720> lot<00:04:39.810> of<00:04:39.930> fun

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
so I thought why he says a lot of fun

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.060 
so I thought why he says a lot of fun
you<00:04:40.380> know<00:04:40.440> so<00:04:40.920> he<00:04:41.100> can<00:04:41.360> focus<00:04:42.680> on<00:04:43.680> cleanup

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
you know so he can focus on cleanup

00:04:44.070 --> 00:05:03.700 
you know so he can focus on cleanup
that's<00:04:44.670> a<00:04:45.060> mankini

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.370 

thanks
