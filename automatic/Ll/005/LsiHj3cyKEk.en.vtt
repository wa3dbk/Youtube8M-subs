one-percent on men agreed guarding now
the<00:00:16.820> trick<00:00:17.510> to<00:00:17.570> this<00:00:17.810> is<00:00:18.110> this<00:00:18.860> five-minute

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
the trick to this is this five-minute

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.760 
the trick to this is this five-minute
clock<00:00:19.700> of<00:00:20.599> this<00:00:20.779> clock<00:00:21.050> display<00:00:21.320> some

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
clock of this clock display some

clock of this clock display some
spawning<00:00:22.250> and<00:00:22.580> be<00:00:22.730> spawning<00:00:23.029> of<00:00:23.270> items<00:00:23.660> shout

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
spawning and be spawning of items shout

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.939 
spawning and be spawning of items shout
out<00:00:24.560> by<00:00:24.680> this<00:00:24.740> this<00:00:25.490> dispenser<00:00:26.090> and<00:00:26.600> it<00:00:27.260> if<00:00:27.470> I

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
out by this this dispenser and it if I

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:29.200 
out by this this dispenser and it if I
started<00:00:28.010> to<00:00:28.279> explain<00:00:28.550> it<00:00:28.730> you<00:00:28.820> probably<00:00:29.000> get

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
started to explain it you probably get

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.370 
started to explain it you probably get
confused<00:00:29.600> so<00:00:29.750> I'm<00:00:29.840> just<00:00:29.960> going<00:00:30.080> to<00:00:30.140> show<00:00:30.230> you

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
confused so I'm just going to show you

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.450 
confused so I'm just going to show you
the<00:00:30.500> building<00:00:31.180> hopefully<00:00:32.180> you'll<00:00:32.300> get<00:00:32.419> it

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
the building hopefully you'll get it

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.700 
the building hopefully you'll get it
okay<00:00:34.460> so<00:00:35.150> here's<00:00:35.570> the<00:00:35.660> recoil<00:00:36.199> over<00:00:36.440> here

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
okay so here's the recoil over here

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.890 
okay so here's the recoil over here
here's<00:00:37.519> a<00:00:37.610> circuit<00:00:38.000> so<00:00:38.480> we're<00:00:38.600> going<00:00:38.690> to<00:00:38.780> build

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
here's a circuit so we're going to build

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.070 
here's a circuit so we're going to build
this<00:00:38.989> block<00:00:39.199> and<00:00:39.860> have<00:00:40.070> to<00:00:40.280> note<00:00:40.460> blocks<00:00:41.080> like

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.080 
this block and have to note blocks like

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.079 
this block and have to note blocks like
then<00:00:42.260> I'm<00:00:42.830> going<00:00:42.979> to<00:00:43.040> have<00:00:43.129> circuits<00:00:43.820> coming

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:44.089 
then I'm going to have circuits coming

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:46.479 
then I'm going to have circuits coming
out<00:00:44.180> like<00:00:44.300> this<00:00:44.530> well<00:00:45.530> this<00:00:45.710> circuit<00:00:46.129> is<00:00:46.159> going

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
out like this well this circuit is going

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.229 
out like this well this circuit is going
to<00:00:46.550> come<00:00:46.760> right<00:00:47.180> here<00:00:47.420> we<00:00:48.350> have<00:00:48.559> place<00:00:48.860> a<00:00:48.890> block

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
to come right here we have place a block

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.729 
to come right here we have place a block
they're<00:00:50.239> going<00:00:50.390> to<00:00:50.479> place<00:00:50.750> a<00:00:50.780> torch<00:00:51.199> on<00:00:51.620> the

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
they're going to place a torch on the

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.430 
they're going to place a torch on the
other<00:00:51.920> side<00:00:52.129> of<00:00:52.159> the<00:00:52.309> circuit<00:00:52.720> and<00:00:53.720> now<00:00:53.900> i'm

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
other side of the circuit and now i'm

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.469 
other side of the circuit and now i'm
going<00:00:54.620> to<00:00:54.680> have<00:00:55.040> the<00:00:55.250> slide<00:00:55.580> by<00:00:55.820> some<00:00:56.059> circuit

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:56.479 
going to have the slide by some circuit

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:59.619 
going to have the slide by some circuit
that's<00:00:57.199> going<00:00:57.409> to<00:00:57.470> come<00:00:57.650> up<00:00:58.030> to<00:00:59.030> a<00:00:59.089> dispenser

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
that's going to come up to a dispenser

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.240 
that's going to come up to a dispenser
that's<00:01:00.470> raised<00:01:00.920> money<00:01:01.309> block<00:01:02.229> okay<00:01:03.250> we're

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
that's raised money block okay we're

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.120 
that's raised money block okay we're
going<00:01:04.400> to<00:01:04.460> place<00:01:04.670> it<00:01:04.699> dispenser<00:01:05.799> has<00:01:06.799> it<00:01:06.979> all

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
going to place it dispenser has it all

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.740 
going to place it dispenser has it all
behind<00:01:07.340> it<00:01:07.700> circles<00:01:09.970> like<00:01:10.970> that<00:01:11.150> okay<00:01:11.690> so

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
behind it circles like that okay so

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.090 
behind it circles like that okay so
that's<00:01:11.990> going<00:01:12.080> to<00:01:12.140> activate<00:01:12.470> this<00:01:12.740> dispenser

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
that's going to activate this dispenser

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.130 
that's going to activate this dispenser
now<00:01:13.969> we<00:01:14.180> have<00:01:14.539> to<00:01:14.689> place<00:01:14.960> a<00:01:15.850> pressure<00:01:16.850> plate

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
now we have to place a pressure plate

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.319 
now we have to place a pressure plate
right<00:01:18.140> here<00:01:19.600> right<00:01:20.600> here<00:01:21.759> now<00:01:22.759> this<00:01:22.909> pressure

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:23.329 
right here right here now this pressure

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:28.120 
right here right here now this pressure
cape<00:01:25.090> plays<00:01:26.090> a<00:01:26.119> key<00:01:26.420> role<00:01:26.530> so<00:01:27.530> now<00:01:27.679> we<00:01:27.740> connect

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
cape plays a key role so now we connect

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.510 
cape plays a key role so now we connect
these<00:01:28.250> circuits<00:01:29.109> okay<00:01:30.109> so<00:01:30.170> when<00:01:30.560> you<00:01:30.679> put<00:01:30.920> rent

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
these circuits okay so when you put rent

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.300 
these circuits okay so when you put rent
like<00:01:31.820> you<00:01:32.030> you<00:01:32.689> have<00:01:32.899> random<00:01:33.320> crap<00:01:33.590> like<00:01:34.100> we

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
like you you have random crap like we

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.440 
like you you have random crap like we
always<00:01:34.520> do<00:01:34.850> and<00:01:35.119> put<00:01:36.079> it<00:01:36.200> here<00:01:37.039> and<00:01:37.250> then<00:01:38.210> it

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
always do and put it here and then it

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.989 
always do and put it here and then it
will<00:01:38.570> get<00:01:38.719> shot<00:01:39.079> out<00:01:39.219> now<00:01:40.219> let<00:01:40.399> me<00:01:40.429> grab<00:01:40.759> some

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:40.999 
will get shot out now let me grab some

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:43.539 
will get shot out now let me grab some
of<00:01:41.030> this<00:01:41.499> that<00:01:42.499> will<00:01:42.619> get<00:01:42.740> shot<00:01:43.009> out<00:01:43.039> and<00:01:43.429> i'll

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
of this that will get shot out and i'll

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.130 
of this that will get shot out and i'll
get<00:01:43.640> put<00:01:43.880> here<00:01:43.909> we<00:01:44.390> all<00:01:44.509> have<00:01:44.630> right<00:01:44.810> oh<00:01:44.840> crap

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
get put here we all have right oh crap

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.660 
get put here we all have right oh crap
so<00:01:45.350> HSN<00:01:45.590> you<00:01:45.740> put<00:01:45.920> random<00:01:46.189> crap<00:01:46.429> in<00:01:46.579> the

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
so HSN you put random crap in the

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.459 
so HSN you put random crap in the
dispenser<00:01:47.119> and<00:01:47.570> sort<00:01:47.899> of<00:01:47.929> like<00:01:48.049> build<00:01:48.350> around

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:48.469 
dispenser and sort of like build around

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:50.410 
dispenser and sort of like build around
it<00:01:48.770> so<00:01:49.039> it's<00:01:49.579> shooting<00:01:49.969> on<00:01:50.119> the<00:01:50.149> pressure

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
it so it's shooting on the pressure

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:57.330 
it so it's shooting on the pressure
plate

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.929 

okay<00:01:58.340> so<00:01:58.999> now<00:01:59.179> if<00:02:00.049> I<00:02:00.319> read<00:02:00.770> like<00:02:01.219> we<00:02:01.670> do<00:02:01.819> the

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
okay so now if I read like we do the

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:07.569 
okay so now if I read like we do the
circuit<00:02:04.450> to<00:02:05.450> shoot<00:02:05.659> out<00:02:05.810> natural<00:02:06.200> and<00:02:06.319> now<00:02:07.250> if

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
circuit to shoot out natural and now if

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:12.820 
circuit to shoot out natural and now if
I<00:02:07.700> take<00:02:07.969> the<00:02:08.149> circuit<00:02:08.509> right<00:02:08.690> here<00:02:10.420> in<00:02:11.830> the

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
I take the circuit right here in the

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.330 
I take the circuit right here in the
next<00:02:13.040> five<00:02:13.370> minutes<00:02:13.780> this<00:02:14.860> will<00:02:15.860> be<00:02:16.010> spawned

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
next five minutes this will be spawned

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.559 
next five minutes this will be spawned
will<00:02:16.819> cause<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:18.640> reactivate<00:02:19.640> that<00:02:19.879> will

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
will cause the reactivate that will

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.320 
will cause the reactivate that will
cause<00:02:20.780> this<00:02:21.349> to<00:02:21.980> work<00:02:22.129> okay<00:02:22.459> guys<00:02:23.000> so<00:02:23.239> it's

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
cause this to work okay guys so it's

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.140 
cause this to work okay guys so it's
been<00:02:23.599> just<00:02:23.840> about<00:02:24.019> five<00:02:24.590> minutes<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.970> we

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
been just about five minutes and we
