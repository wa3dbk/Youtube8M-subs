00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.020
 without body language of the marking of 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.500

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.930
 there 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.760
 if you have an indication of a 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.640
 page people will not use much in this 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.189
 course but it's cool you had this 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.610

 during the course of the software you will 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.590

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.159
 want to pay the license or even not 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.860
 You want to use pirated software? 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.600
 also the netbeans hint is that it 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.450
 will replace your one of a free is a 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.250
 complete free software until you 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.189
 many functions better than those of a 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.439
 then release some cool software and 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.299
 to replace the firewall that people 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.540
 here is a jeep that also a software 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.490
 free and you get all the 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.469
 functions that have the firewall that's an 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.110
 bit different interface but all the 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.990
 functions there are both softwares ok 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.329
 so summarizing people there is the software 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.459
 that you chose between the data of the 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.760
 free is necessary to have a 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.380
 indicated at least or having from a book 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.390
 fire works or netbeans 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.650
 you have to have it installed on your 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.360
 machine here 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.100
 I advise you reading a book. 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.680
 fire works to follow the course 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.750
 because it will be much easier for you to see 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.660
 the same interface to work 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.580

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.650

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.950
 night prompts are well diverting will not 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.440
 cause no problem observe is 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.090
 It's necessary that we, after testing 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.840
