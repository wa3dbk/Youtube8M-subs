00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
separate materials from a single stream

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.820 
separate materials from a single stream
single<00:00:26.070> stream<00:00:26.369> recycling<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:27.060> really<00:00:27.830> a

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
single stream recycling is really a

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.429 
single stream recycling is really a
situation<00:00:29.310> where<00:00:29.880> we've<00:00:30.029> taken<00:00:30.269> sorting<00:00:30.990> your

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
situation where we've taken sorting your

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.700 
situation where we've taken sorting your
recycled<00:00:32.399> material<00:00:32.940> in<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.710> controlled

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
recycled material in a controlled

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.040 
recycled material in a controlled
environment<00:00:35.090> such<00:00:36.090> as<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.300> recycling<00:00:37.020> facility

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
environment such as a recycling facility

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.470 
environment such as a recycling facility
that's<00:00:37.649> able<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.010> sort<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.399> automatically<00:00:39.000> so

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
that's able to sort it automatically so

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.540 
that's able to sort it automatically so
recycle<00:00:40.140> your<00:00:40.320> old<00:00:40.379> multi-coloured<00:00:41.280> bins

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
recycle your old multi-coloured bins

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.910 
recycle your old multi-coloured bins
because<00:00:42.180> being<00:00:42.450> green<00:00:42.899> has<00:00:43.140> gotten<00:00:43.500> even

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
because being green has gotten even

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.850 
because being green has gotten even
easier<00:00:44.250> gets<00:00:44.730> dumped<00:00:45.120> in<00:00:45.629> in<00:00:46.079> one<00:00:46.289> large<00:00:46.559> pile

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
easier gets dumped in in one large pile

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.410 
easier gets dumped in in one large pile
on<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.190> what<00:00:47.489> we<00:00:47.640> call<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.969> tipping<00:00:48.270> floor

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
on it what we call the tipping floor

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.270 
on it what we call the tipping floor
from<00:00:49.350> there<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.649> tipping<00:00:49.950> floor<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.250> goes

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
from there the tipping floor it goes

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.600 
from there the tipping floor it goes
onto<00:00:50.670> conveyors<00:00:51.199> to<00:00:52.199> various<00:00:52.829> screen<00:00:53.250> so<00:00:53.520> it

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
onto conveyors to various screen so it

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.610 
onto conveyors to various screen so it
first<00:00:53.820> goes<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.360> cardboard<00:00:54.840> screen<00:00:55.410> and

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
first goes to a cardboard screen and

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.869 
first goes to a cardboard screen and
then<00:00:56.039> from<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.370> goes<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.760> another

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
then from that it goes to another

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.849 
then from that it goes to another
section<00:00:57.480> where<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.780> newspaper<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.469> removed

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
section where the newspaper is removed

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.360 
section where the newspaper is removed
and<00:00:59.070> then<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.649> remaining<00:01:01.649> material<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.219> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
and then the remaining material is the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.990 
and then the remaining material is the
containers<00:01:02.940> lumen<00:01:03.750> cans<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.379> tin<00:01:04.619> cans
