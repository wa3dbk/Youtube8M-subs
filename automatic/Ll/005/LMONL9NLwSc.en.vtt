had in the earlier part of garo pretty

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.330 
had in the earlier part of garo pretty
much<00:00:24.240> like<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.510> monster-of-the-week<00:00:25.340> format

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
that's pretty much what this episode was

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.769

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
perspective with these Lords like for

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.400 
perspective with these Lords like for
instance<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.570> how<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.750> two<00:00:36.960> Lords<00:00:37.290> were

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
instance to how the two Lords were

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.049 
instance to how the two Lords were
rivals<00:00:37.649> how<00:00:38.070> they<00:00:38.190> competed<00:00:38.640> even<00:00:38.940> though

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
rivals how they competed even though

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.729 
rivals how they competed even though
they<00:00:39.239> were<00:00:39.300> whores<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:40.020> at<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.230> exact<00:00:40.530> same

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
they were whores and at the exact same

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.950 
they were whores and at the exact same
time<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.280> have<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.700> where<00:00:41.960> technically

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
time you have it to where technically

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.869 
time you have it to where technically
Herman<00:00:43.410> goes<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:43.890> castle<00:00:44.160> without

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
Herman goes to that castle without

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.150 
Herman goes to that castle without
actually<00:00:45.690> knowing<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.200> castle<00:00:46.770> was<00:00:46.890> cursed

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
actually knowing that castle was cursed

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.790 
actually knowing that castle was cursed
so<00:00:47.550> episode<00:00:48.510> overall<00:00:48.989> it's<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.320> standard

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
so episode overall it's a standard

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.770 
so episode overall it's a standard

when it came to this episode voice
acting<00:02:08.819> wise<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.239> felt<00:02:09.509> like<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.780> voice<00:02:09.989> acting

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500

was pretty damn good this happens are

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.820 
was pretty damn good this happens are
actually<00:02:12.060> better<00:02:12.209> than

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
actually better than

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.740 
actually better than
episodes<00:02:13.400> besides<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.820> later<00:02:14.000> half<00:02:14.180> a<00:02:14.300> part<00:02:14.540> 1

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
episodes besides the later half a part 1

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.720 
episodes besides the later half a part 1
so<00:02:15.110> I<00:02:15.350> like<00:02:15.770> the<00:02:15.920> voice<00:02:16.040> acting<00:02:16.460> with<00:02:16.580> this
