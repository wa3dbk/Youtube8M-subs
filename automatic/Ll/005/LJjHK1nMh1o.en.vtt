the<00:00:22.439> garden<00:00:22.769> giant<00:00:25.430> these<00:00:26.430> grew<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:27.420> this<00:00:27.570> size

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
the garden giant these grew to this size

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.820 
the garden giant these grew to this size
in<00:00:28.199> two<00:00:28.439> days<00:00:30.170> it's<00:00:31.170> like<00:00:31.380> some<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.650> them

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
in two days it's like some of them

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.819 
in two days it's like some of them
probably<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.669> maybe<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.750> 1<00:00:33.960> foot<00:00:34.200> diameter<00:00:34.440> at

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
probably a maybe a 1 foot diameter at

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.080 
probably a maybe a 1 foot diameter at
the<00:00:34.860> biggest<00:00:36.020> stem<00:00:37.020> it's<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.879> guy<00:00:38.879> who<00:00:38.940> owns

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
the biggest stem it's the guy who owns

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.520 
the biggest stem it's the guy who owns
the<00:00:39.210> company<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.690> ordered<00:00:40.020> him<00:00:40.079> from<00:00:40.379> that

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
the company that I ordered him from that

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.130 
the company that I ordered him from that
claims<00:00:41.010> he's<00:00:41.160> got<00:00:41.239> got<00:00:42.239> him<00:00:42.360> up<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.660> about<00:00:42.840> two

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
claims he's got got him up to about two

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.760 
claims he's got got him up to about two
feet<00:00:43.170> in<00:00:43.469> diameter<00:00:43.649> before<00:00:44.840> so<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:46.079> use<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> bunch

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
feet in diameter before so I use a bunch

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.080 
feet in diameter before so I use a bunch
of<00:00:46.950> different<00:00:47.250> kinds<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.489> hardwood<00:00:47.879> these

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
of different kinds of hardwood these

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.610 
of different kinds of hardwood these
ones<00:00:48.270> don't<00:00:48.420> need<00:00:48.600> evergreen<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.410> can't

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
ones don't need evergreen so you can't

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.920 
ones don't need evergreen so you can't
go<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.860> like<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.460> landscaping<00:00:51.149> place<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.809> get<00:00:51.899> a

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
go to like a landscaping place and get a

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.709 
go to like a landscaping place and get a
bag<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.170> cedar<00:00:52.559> mulch<00:00:52.800> or<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.340> pine<00:00:53.730> mulch<00:00:53.969> it

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
bag of cedar mulch or a pine mulch it

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.330 
bag of cedar mulch or a pine mulch it
needs<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.989> be<00:00:55.079> hardwood<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:56.160> there's

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
needs to be hardwood and so there's

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.520 
needs to be hardwood and so there's
birch<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:57.510> see<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.690> lot<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.870> white<00:00:58.079> birch<00:00:58.320> in

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
birch you see a lot of white birch in

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.900 
birch you see a lot of white birch in
there<00:00:58.710> maple<00:00:59.340> oak<00:00:59.449> primarily<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:01.640> if<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.760> get

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
there maple oak primarily and if you get

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.130 
there maple oak primarily and if you get
them<00:01:03.000> nice<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.180> thin<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.570> think<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.870> get<00:01:03.989> more

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
them nice and thin I think you get more

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.050 
them nice and thin I think you get more
surface<00:01:04.470> area<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.040> my<00:01:05.159> cilia<00:01:05.549> that's<00:01:05.790> the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
surface area in the my cilia that's the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.940 
surface area in the my cilia that's the
the<00:01:06.420> white<00:01:06.659> sheets<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.320> stuff<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.799> the

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
the white sheets of stuff that the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.340 
the white sheets of stuff that the
mushrooms<00:01:08.280> grow<00:01:08.460> up<00:01:08.549> out<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:09.049> it'll<00:01:10.049> cover

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
mushrooms grow up out of it'll cover

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.020 
mushrooms grow up out of it'll cover
over<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.659> the<00:01:12.659> wood<00:01:12.869> as<00:01:13.680> its<00:01:14.100> as<00:01:14.580> its<00:01:14.760> growing

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
over the the wood as its as its growing

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.999 
over the the wood as its as its growing
and<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:15.450> if<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.659> maximize<00:01:15.840> surface<00:01:16.350> area<00:01:16.860> by

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
and so if you maximize surface area by

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.800 
and so if you maximize surface area by
getting<00:01:17.250> nice<00:01:17.369> thin<00:01:17.640> strips<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.509> they<00:01:18.659> get

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
getting nice thin strips and they get

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.929 
getting nice thin strips and they get
kind<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.080> like<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:20.070> know<00:01:20.100> shoots<00:01:20.700> pretty

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
kind of like you know shoots pretty

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.469 
kind of like you know shoots pretty
rapidly<00:01:21.270> if<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.900> grab<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> piece<00:01:22.320> here<00:01:23.360> see<00:01:24.360> it's

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
rapidly if I grab a piece here see it's

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.380 
rapidly if I grab a piece here see it's
really<00:01:25.220> all<00:01:26.220> stuck<00:01:26.549> together<00:01:26.729> kind<00:01:27.330> of

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
really all stuck together kind of

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.120 
really all stuck together kind of
sawdust<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.439> mycelium<00:01:28.799> from<00:01:29.070> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
sawdust and the mycelium from the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.289 
sawdust and the mycelium from the
mushroom<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.549> kind<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.729> like<00:01:29.880> holding<00:01:30.180> all

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
mushroom is kind of like holding all

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.780 
mushroom is kind of like holding all
that<00:01:30.420> stuff<00:01:30.750> together<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.579> it's<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.610> pretty

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
that stuff together so it's a pretty

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.620 
that stuff together so it's a pretty
strong<00:01:34.250> mycelial<00:01:35.250> growth<00:01:35.490> for<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.000> garden

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
strong mycelial growth for the garden

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.770 
strong mycelial growth for the garden
giant<00:01:37.759> I'm<00:01:38.759> hoping<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.240> be<00:01:39.329> able<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.600> make

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
giant I'm hoping to be able to make

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.480 
giant I'm hoping to be able to make
another<00:01:40.079> patch<00:01:40.380> off<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.829> this<00:01:40.920> using<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.340> little

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
another patch off of this using a little

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.850 
another patch off of this using a little
cardboard<00:01:41.820> like

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
cardboard like

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.800 
cardboard like
stem<00:01:44.490> it's<00:01:44.670> wrote<00:01:44.850> about<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.270> mycelium

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
stem it's wrote about in mycelium

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.570 
stem it's wrote about in mycelium
running<00:01:46.110> which<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.320> where<00:01:46.620> I<00:01:46.650> kind<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.370> got<00:01:47.490> the

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
running which is where I kind of got the

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.600 
running which is where I kind of got the
idea<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.910> ordering<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:49.160> mushroom<00:01:50.160> kit<00:01:50.400> from

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
idea of ordering the mushroom kit from

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.890 
idea of ordering the mushroom kit from
them<00:01:52.730> I<00:01:53.750> put<00:01:54.750> this<00:01:54.990> patch<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.620> and<00:01:55.860> oh<00:01:56.720> I<00:01:57.720> think

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
them I put this patch in and oh I think

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.440 
them I put this patch in and oh I think
like<00:01:58.200> April<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.920> it's<00:01:59.490> now<00:01:59.670> just<00:01:59.940> to<00:02:00.090> start<00:02:00.360> a

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
like April and it's now just to start a

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.690 
like April and it's now just to start a
September<00:02:01.040> we<00:02:02.040> had<00:02:02.160> some<00:02:02.310> good<00:02:02.460> hard

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
September we had some good hard

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.150 
September we had some good hard
September<00:02:03.480> late<00:02:03.750> August<00:02:04.140> rains<00:02:04.410> and<00:02:04.770> just

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
September late August rains and just

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.650 
September late August rains and just
poof<00:02:05.370> it<00:02:05.550> all<00:02:05.640> came<00:02:05.880> up<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.240> couple<00:02:06.510> days

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
poof it all came up in a couple days

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.850 
poof it all came up in a couple days
like<00:02:06.960> this<00:02:09.110> so<00:02:10.110> this<00:02:10.230> was<00:02:10.410> probably<00:02:10.530> good<00:02:10.830> for

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
like this so this was probably good for

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.810 
like this so this was probably good for
another<00:02:11.190> two<00:02:11.940> more<00:02:12.120> summers<00:02:12.390> like<00:02:13.820> 2013-2014

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
another two more summers like 2013-2014

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.730 
another two more summers like 2013-2014
and<00:02:15.000> if<00:02:15.090> I<00:02:15.180> add<00:02:15.360> wood<00:02:15.660> chips<00:02:15.990> and<00:02:16.200> sawdust<00:02:16.560> and

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
and if I add wood chips and sawdust and

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.080 
and if I add wood chips and sawdust and
kind<00:02:16.860> of<00:02:16.890> make<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.070> run<00:02:17.370> I<00:02:17.400> think<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:17.790> can<00:02:17.940> make

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.050 
kind of make a run I think I can make
the<00:02:18.210> patch<00:02:18.390> just<00:02:18.660> kind<00:02:18.870> of<00:02:18.960> grow<00:02:19.230> that<00:02:19.530> way

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
the patch just kind of grow that way

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.720 
the patch just kind of grow that way
it's<00:02:21.060> supposed<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.420> go<00:02:21.600> well<00:02:21.870> with<00:02:22.140> um<00:02:22.730> like

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
it's supposed to go well with um like

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.850 
it's supposed to go well with um like
grains<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.330> grasses<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:25.440> we're<00:02:25.590> hoping<00:02:25.800> to

I think stands for a really pronounced

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.199 
I think stands for a really pronounced
ring<00:03:10.409> from<00:03:11.129> the<00:03:11.190> Vale<00:03:11.459> that<00:03:11.700> but<00:03:12.030> as<00:03:12.180> a

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
ring from the Vale that but as a

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.210 
ring from the Vale that but as a
mushroom<00:03:12.629> opens<00:03:12.870> up<00:03:13.019> there's<00:03:13.260> a<00:03:13.319> thin

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
mushroom opens up there's a thin

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.770 
mushroom opens up there's a thin
membrane<00:03:14.459> here<00:03:14.879> that<00:03:15.030> kind<00:03:15.180> of<00:03:15.209> rolls<00:03:15.510> down

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
membrane here that kind of rolls down

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.229 
membrane here that kind of rolls down
the<00:03:15.810> stock<00:03:16.430> all<00:03:17.430> right<00:03:17.549> so<00:03:17.700> there's<00:03:17.879> one<00:03:18.090> with

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
the stock all right so there's one with

you see once we're there

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.539 
you see once we're there
whether<00:03:22.049> it's<00:03:22.200> hanging<00:03:23.040> down<00:03:23.190> farther

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
whether it's hanging down farther

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:24.979 
whether it's hanging down farther
they're<00:03:23.790> really<00:03:23.940> pretty<00:03:24.150> right<00:03:24.599> there<00:03:24.780> nice

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
um this past time I've got two kits so I

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.789 
um this past time I've got two kits so I
really<00:03:44.040> saturated<00:03:44.640> it<00:03:44.730> up<00:03:44.819> to<00:03:45.030> grow

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
really saturated it up to grow

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.199 
really saturated it up to grow
aggressively<00:03:46.799> here<00:03:46.980> in<00:03:47.099> the<00:03:47.190> fall<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.609> I'm

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
aggressively here in the fall and I'm

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.660 
aggressively here in the fall and I'm
really<00:03:48.390> happy<00:03:48.629> to<00:03:48.780> see<00:03:48.989> that<00:03:49.019> it<00:03:49.230> has<00:03:50.569> I<00:03:51.569> think

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
really happy to see that it has I think

like<00:03:53.670> next<00:03:54.120> year<00:03:54.209> I'm<00:03:54.420> hoping<00:03:54.540> I'll<00:03:54.810> get<00:03:54.959> two

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
like next year I'm hoping I'll get two

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
figure out the actual protein breakdown

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.630 
figure out the actual protein breakdown
and<00:04:13.620> all<00:04:13.710> that<00:04:13.890> you'd<00:04:14.100> have<00:04:14.220> to<00:04:14.340> look<00:04:14.460> it<00:04:14.580> up

and all that you'd have to look it up

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.199 
and all that you'd have to look it up
online<00:04:14.880> but<00:04:15.360> most<00:04:16.230> most<00:04:17.040> mushrooms<00:04:17.730> are<00:04:17.940> in

and look at all that mycelium on the
bottom<00:04:50.410> of<00:04:50.470> that<00:04:55.259> it's<00:04:56.259> a<00:04:56.319> good<00:04:56.470> patch<00:04:56.789> you<00:04:57.789> can

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
bottom of that it's a good patch you can

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.930 
bottom of that it's a good patch you can
see<00:04:58.150> the<00:04:58.440> in<00:04:59.440> the<00:04:59.590> gills<00:04:59.800> here<00:05:00.130> that<00:05:00.490> the<00:05:00.699> the

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
see the in the gills here that the the

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.629 
see the in the gills here that the the
spore<00:05:01.270> from<00:05:01.479> this<00:05:01.630> is<00:05:01.780> really<00:05:01.960> a<00:05:02.500> dark<00:05:02.860> black<00:05:03.250> I

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
spore from this is really a dark black I

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:05.670 
spore from this is really a dark black I
think<00:05:04.060> if<00:05:04.300> you<00:05:04.419> get<00:05:04.569> it<00:05:04.720> at<00:05:04.990> this<00:05:05.199> stage<00:05:05.470> where

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
think if you get it at this stage where

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.540 
think if you get it at this stage where
it's<00:05:05.770> starting<00:05:05.889> to<00:05:06.099> release<00:05:06.250> those<00:05:06.460> spores

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
it's starting to release those spores

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.129 
it's starting to release those spores
like<00:05:06.940> any<00:05:07.090> sauce<00:05:07.389> you<00:05:07.630> did<00:05:07.780> with<00:05:07.930> it<00:05:08.050> would

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
like any sauce you did with it would

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:10.050 
like any sauce you did with it would
just<00:05:08.349> turn<00:05:08.500> like<00:05:08.740> really<00:05:09.310> black<00:05:09.610> might<00:05:09.910> be<00:05:10.030> a

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
just turn like really black might be a

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.749 
just turn like really black might be a
bit<00:05:10.479> too<00:05:10.690> intense<00:05:11.020> you<00:05:11.919> know<00:05:11.949> just<00:05:12.310> black<00:05:12.580> my

bit too intense you know just black my
fingers<00:05:13.060> get<00:05:13.240> in<00:05:13.479> this<00:05:13.660> that's<00:05:14.169> poor<00:05:18.270> for

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
fingers get in this that's poor for
