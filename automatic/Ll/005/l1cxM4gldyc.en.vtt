00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.139 
my doctor did says should try to do 3k
but<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.250> think<00:02:05.460> she<00:02:05.520> was<00:02:05.579> just<00:02:05.729> being<00:02:05.909> really

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
but I think she was just being really

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.280 
but I think she was just being really
conservative

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
conservative

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.740 
conservative
I think<00:02:07.530> if<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:08.430> used<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.759> drink<00:02:08.940> five<00:02:09.060> k3k

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
I think if you used to drink five k3k

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.750 
I think if you used to drink five k3k
feels<00:02:09.990> like<00:02:10.170> nothing<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:11.100> me<00:02:11.220> at<00:02:11.400> least<00:02:11.580> I've

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
feels like nothing to me at least I've

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.090 
feels like nothing to me at least I've
been<00:02:11.910> doing<00:02:12.090> 5k<00:02:12.510> twice<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.780> week<00:02:13.080> for<00:02:13.380> years<00:02:13.740> she

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
dropping and take it easy I know when

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.730 
dropping and take it easy I know when
then<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:19.740> are<00:02:19.920> cute<00:02:20.810> no<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:21.840> wasn't<00:02:22.350> arguing

justifying her yet I think it's more

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.410

harmful<00:02:28.860> not<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.340> exercise<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:30.000> exercise
