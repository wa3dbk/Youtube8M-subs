00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
bit crispy it's not too soft so when the

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.930 
bit crispy it's not too soft so when the
juice<00:00:31.410> from<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.710> gravy<00:00:32.009> gets<00:00:32.340> on<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.910> the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
bread it kind of absorbs it without it

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.639 
bread it kind of absorbs it without it
getting<00:00:35.730> too<00:00:35.969> mushy<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.450> like<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.320> start<00:00:37.530> with

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
getting too mushy I like to start with

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.190 
getting too mushy I like to start with
cubing<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.190> into<00:00:39.120> nice<00:00:39.239> cubes<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.750> fits<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.050> lot

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
cubing it into nice cubes it fits a lot

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.830 
cubing it into nice cubes it fits a lot
better<00:00:40.410> into<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.770> bottom<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.250> jar<00:00:41.840> you

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
better into the bottom of the jar you

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.779 
better into the bottom of the jar you
certainly<00:00:43.170> could<00:00:43.440> keep<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.219> flat<00:00:44.430> like<00:00:44.460> this

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
certainly could keep it flat like this

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.160 
certainly could keep it flat like this
and<00:00:45.030> make<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.180> more<00:00:45.420> like<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.629> sandwich<00:00:45.960> but

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
and make it more like a sandwich but

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.720 
and make it more like a sandwich but
it's<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.350> lot<00:00:46.469> easier<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.829> eat<00:00:47.010> inside<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.520> jar

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
it's a lot easier to eat inside the jar

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.790 
it's a lot easier to eat inside the jar
with<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.210> fork<00:00:49.190> after<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:51.079> bread<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.410> like<00:00:52.649> to

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
with a fork after the bread I like to

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.130
