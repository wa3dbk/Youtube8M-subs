00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.370 
assassins
would<00:02:14.040> say<00:02:14.370> while<00:02:15.150> they're<00:02:15.420> not<00:02:15.630> anywhere

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.080 
would say while they're not anywhere
near<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.830> season<00:02:17.130> two<00:02:17.310> world<00:02:17.490> champions<00:02:17.910> they

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
near the season two world champions they

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.880 
near the season two world champions they
were<00:02:18.270> they<00:02:18.480> haven't<00:02:18.780> got<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.140> same<00:02:19.319> players

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
were they haven't got the same players

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.020 
were they haven't got the same players
in<00:02:20.130> their<00:02:20.250> folk<00:02:20.430> there's<00:02:20.580> not<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:20.760> single

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
in their folk there's not a single

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.690 
in their folk there's not a single
player<00:02:21.390> on<00:02:21.480> your<00:02:21.510> bb<00:02:21.930> had<00:02:22.440> retired<00:02:22.860> after<00:02:23.190> the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
player on your bb had retired after the

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.110 
player on your bb had retired after the
season<00:02:24.360> 4<00:02:24.540> 2014<00:02:25.190> World<00:02:26.190> Championships<00:02:26.760> we<00:02:26.910> had

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
season 4 2014 World Championships we had

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.020 
season 4 2014 World Championships we had
of<00:02:27.239> course<00:02:27.360> in<00:02:27.569> Taipei<00:02:28.580> so<00:02:29.580> there's<00:02:29.760> no<00:02:29.849> one<00:02:30.000> on

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
of course in Taipei so there's no one on

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.550 
of course in Taipei so there's no one on
that<00:02:30.150> roster<00:02:30.390> anymore<00:02:30.780> but<00:02:30.959> still<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:31.500> think

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
that roster anymore but still I think

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.050 
that roster anymore but still I think
it's<00:02:31.830> safe<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:31.980> say<00:02:32.100> they<00:02:32.340> are<00:02:32.459> favorites<00:02:32.880> they

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
it's safe to say they are favorites they

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.820 
it's safe to say they are favorites they
are<00:02:33.209> running<00:02:33.900> away<00:02:34.170> with<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.500> league<00:02:34.620> in

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
are running away with the league in

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.140 
are running away with the league in
Taipei<00:02:35.190> right<00:02:35.400> now<00:02:35.520> so<00:02:35.730> in<00:02:35.850> this<00:02:35.880> whole

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
Taipei right now so in this whole

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.250 
Taipei right now so in this whole
tournament<00:02:36.360> I'd<00:02:36.690> say<00:02:36.870> Taipei<00:02:37.200> assassins

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
tournament I'd say Taipei assassins

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.720 
tournament I'd say Taipei assassins

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
probably the big favourites the

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.370 
probably the big favourites the
Australian<00:02:39.330> team<00:02:39.540> haven't<00:02:39.900> got<00:02:40.019> a<00:02:40.050> sentient

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.770 
season to Taipei assassins funnily
enough and<00:03:23.030> Bangkok<00:03:24.030> Titans<00:03:24.239> were<00:03:24.450> actually

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
enough and Bangkok Titans were actually

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.620 
enough and Bangkok Titans were actually
completely<00:03:25.739> destroying<00:03:26.340> their<00:03:26.670> group<00:03:26.970> in<00:03:27.150> in

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
completely destroying their group in in

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.569 
completely destroying their group in in
GPL<00:03:28.049> currently<00:03:28.440> 60<00:03:28.890> and<00:03:28.980> not<00:03:29.070> even<00:03:29.250> dropped<00:03:29.459> a

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
GPL currently 60 and not even dropped a

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.849 
GPL currently 60 and not even dropped a
match<00:03:29.730> so<00:03:30.060> in<00:03:30.570> theory<00:03:30.930> this<00:03:31.230> should<00:03:31.290> be<00:03:31.530> very

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
match so in theory this should be very

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.680 
match so in theory this should be very
tight<00:03:32.130> game<00:03:32.370> but<00:03:32.640> it's<00:03:32.940> going<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.150> be<00:03:33.209> hard<00:03:33.480> for

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
tight game but it's going to be hard for

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.240 
tight game but it's going to be hard for
us<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:33.780> George<00:03:34.079> I<00:03:34.200> think<00:03:34.230> how<00:03:34.590> these<00:03:34.920> two

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
us to George I think how these two

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.670 
us to George I think how these two
regions<00:03:35.489> clash<00:03:36.030> yeah<00:03:36.660> it<00:03:36.870> may<00:03:36.959> be<00:03:37.230> interesting

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
regions clash yeah it may be interesting

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.800 
regions clash yeah it may be interesting
how<00:03:37.739> it<00:03:37.829> works<00:03:38.010> out<00:03:38.190> for<00:03:38.250> them<00:03:38.459> and<00:03:38.579> like<00:03:39.239> we

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
how it works out for them and like we

00:05:59.720 --> 00:05:59.730 
way think it's like a normally a

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.360 
way think it's like a normally a
two-week<00:06:00.090> gap<00:06:00.390> here<00:06:00.960> it<00:06:01.140> is<00:06:01.290> before<00:06:02.130> they<00:06:02.220> go

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
two-week gap here it is before they go

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.220 
two-week gap here it is before they go
through<00:06:02.669> but<00:06:03.330> pick<00:06:03.480> and<00:06:03.600> bans<00:06:03.720> are<00:06:03.870> started

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.230 
through but pick and bans are started

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.659 
through but pick and bans are started
what<00:06:04.350> are<00:06:04.410> we<00:06:04.500> expecting<00:06:04.950> we're<00:06:05.130> going<00:06:05.490> to<00:06:05.550> go

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:05.669 
what are we expecting we're going to go

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:08.150 
what are we expecting we're going to go
with<00:06:05.760> usuals<00:06:06.270> in<00:06:06.390> a<00:06:06.480> 5.1<00:06:07.140> we<00:06:07.530> haven't<00:06:07.860> seen<00:06:08.010> it

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 
with usuals in a 5.1 we haven't seen it

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.710 
with usuals in a 5.1 we haven't seen it
in<00:06:08.220> the<00:06:08.310> LCS<00:06:08.640> yet<00:06:08.970> I<00:06:09.000> think<00:06:09.240> what<00:06:09.450> would<00:06:09.570> think

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 
in the LCS yet I think what would think

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.110 
in the LCS yet I think what would think
it<00:06:09.810> was<00:06:09.870> for<00:06:10.080> 21<00:06:10.500> last<00:06:10.830> week<00:06:11.100> wasn't<00:06:11.400> it<00:06:11.550> yeah<00:06:12.090> I

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
it was for 21 last week wasn't it yeah I

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.460 
it was for 21 last week wasn't it yeah I
thought<00:06:12.480> this<00:06:12.780> would<00:06:12.930> be<00:06:13.050> like<00:06:13.080> the<00:06:13.260> first

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
thought this would be like the first

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:14.690 
thought this would be like the first
week<00:06:13.710> this<00:06:13.860> coming<00:06:14.130> through<00:06:14.310> so<00:06:14.430> guess

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
week this coming through so guess

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.060 
week this coming through so guess
effectively<00:06:15.690> we<00:06:15.930> are<00:06:16.110> the<00:06:16.230> first<00:06:16.410> to<00:06:16.650> have<00:06:16.800> pi

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.070 
effectively we are the first to have pi

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:18.980 
effectively we are the first to have pi
point<00:06:17.340> one<00:06:17.460> in<00:06:17.580> a<00:06:17.640> competitive<00:06:18.240> tournament<00:06:18.900> I

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
point one in a competitive tournament I

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.240 
point one in a competitive tournament I
don't<00:06:19.200> know<00:06:19.260> we<00:06:19.470> got<00:06:19.500> it<00:06:19.620> can<00:06:19.860> we<00:06:19.950> go<00:06:20.070> to<00:06:20.130> see

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250 
don't know we got it can we go to see

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.159
