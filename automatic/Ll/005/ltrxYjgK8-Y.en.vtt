can go up or down as necessary let's
talk<00:03:00.930> about<00:03:01.049> calibration<00:03:03.290> now<00:03:04.290> it's<00:03:04.530> time<00:03:04.739> to

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
talk about calibration now it's time to

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.129 
talk about calibration now it's time to
calibrate<00:03:05.400> if<00:03:06.239> you<00:03:06.450> notice<00:03:06.750> I<00:03:06.870> have<00:03:06.900> two

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.139 
calibrate if you notice I have two

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.199 
calibrate if you notice I have two
beakers<00:03:07.379> sitting<00:03:07.799> in<00:03:07.889> front<00:03:07.980> of<00:03:08.159> me<00:03:08.400> both<00:03:09.000> of

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
beakers sitting in front of me both of

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.420 
beakers sitting in front of me both of
them<00:03:09.359> have<00:03:09.540> exactly<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.169> same<00:03:10.200> solution<00:03:11.099> 12

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
them have exactly the same solution 12

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.940 
them have exactly the same solution 12
point<00:03:11.730> 88<00:03:12.180> milli<00:03:12.510> Siemens<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.439> reason<00:03:13.680> I<00:03:13.739> have

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
point 88 milli Siemens the reason I have

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.890 
point 88 milli Siemens the reason I have
two<00:03:14.489> beakers<00:03:14.819> in<00:03:14.970> front<00:03:15.180> of<00:03:15.239> me<00:03:15.329> is<00:03:15.510> because<00:03:15.689> I

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
two beakers in front of me is because I

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.199 
two beakers in front of me is because I
want<00:03:16.109> to<00:03:16.200> use<00:03:16.409> one<00:03:16.680> to<00:03:17.400> rinse<00:03:17.609> off<00:03:17.819> the<00:03:18.000> meter

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
want to use one to rinse off the meter

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.539 
want to use one to rinse off the meter
from<00:03:18.449> any<00:03:18.629> contamination<00:03:19.319> that<00:03:20.069> might<00:03:20.250> be<00:03:20.400> on

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
from any contamination that might be on

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:20.750 
from any contamination that might be on
it

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
it

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.119 
it
so<00:03:21.389> once<00:03:21.540> I'm<00:03:21.659> comfortable<00:03:22.079> with<00:03:22.229> that<00:03:22.290> I'm

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
so once I'm comfortable with that I'm

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:24.469 
so once I'm comfortable with that I'm
going<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.340> take<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.609> meter<00:03:23.790> out<00:03:24.000> of<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.239> first

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:24.479 
going to take the meter out of the first

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:27.619 
going to take the meter out of the first
beaker<00:03:25.190> simply<00:03:26.190> put<00:03:26.400> it<00:03:26.489> into<00:03:26.849> the<00:03:27.239> second

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
beaker simply put it into the second

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:31.129 
beaker simply put it into the second
beaker<00:03:28.879> push<00:03:29.879> the<00:03:30.030> left-hand<00:03:30.449> button<00:03:30.720> which

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
beaker push the left-hand button which

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:32.780 
beaker push the left-hand button which
is<00:03:31.260> going<00:03:31.379> to<00:03:31.440> take<00:03:31.590> me<00:03:31.769> into<00:03:31.889> cow<00:03:32.159> and<00:03:32.489> as<00:03:32.579> soon

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
is going to take me into cow and as soon

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.960 
is going to take me into cow and as soon
as<00:03:32.819> it<00:03:32.970> hits<00:03:33.150> cow<00:03:33.359> I'm<00:03:33.900> going<00:03:34.079> to<00:03:34.139> let<00:03:34.319> go<00:03:34.560> and

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
as it hits cow I'm going to let go and

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.280 
as it hits cow I'm going to let go and
it's<00:03:35.970> going<00:03:36.060> to<00:03:36.150> ask<00:03:36.269> for<00:03:36.389> twelve<00:03:36.720> point<00:03:37.049> eight

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
it's going to ask for twelve point eight

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.000 
it's going to ask for twelve point eight
eight<00:03:38.090> now<00:03:39.090> while<00:03:39.299> that's<00:03:39.449> calibrating<00:03:40.290> it's

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
eight now while that's calibrating it's

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.879 
eight now while that's calibrating it's
important<00:03:41.430> to<00:03:41.489> note<00:03:41.669> that<00:03:41.699> if<00:03:42.150> you<00:03:42.540> are

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:42.889 
important to note that if you are

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.250 
important to note that if you are
calibrating<00:03:43.889> for<00:03:43.919> TDS<00:03:44.819> then<00:03:45.599> you<00:03:45.989> follow

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
calibrating for TDS then you follow

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.680 
calibrating for TDS then you follow
exactly<00:03:46.859> the<00:03:46.979> same<00:03:47.190> steps<00:03:47.549> but<00:03:48.180> just<00:03:48.449> use<00:03:48.659> a

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
exactly the same steps but just use a

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.369 
exactly the same steps but just use a
different<00:03:49.109> calibration<00:03:49.919> solution<00:03:51.139> okay<00:03:52.139> this

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
different calibration solution okay this

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:54.379 
different calibration solution okay this
tells<00:03:52.620> me<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:52.769> meter<00:03:53.040> is<00:03:53.340> calibrated<00:03:54.030> ready

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
tells me the meter is calibrated ready

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:59.089 
tells me the meter is calibrated ready
to<00:03:54.540> go<00:03:54.720> and<00:03:55.019> it's<00:03:55.829> time<00:03:55.889> to<00:03:56.159> measure<00:03:58.099> final

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
to go and it's time to measure final

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:03.830 
to go and it's time to measure final
