in the future and I really want to go
back<00:01:45.840> on<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.729> finish<00:01:47.729> what<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:47.909> started

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
so even though I covered a lot of things

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.609 
so even though I covered a lot of things
on<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.420> mechanics<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:52.020> ultra<00:01:52.380> street<00:01:52.560> fighter

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
on the mechanics of ultra street fighter

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.039 
on the mechanics of ultra street fighter
4<00:01:53.070> um<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:54.210> course<00:01:54.270> there's<00:01:54.600> some<00:01:54.689> new<00:01:54.840> stuff

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
4 um of course there's some new stuff

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.929 
4 um of course there's some new stuff
like<00:01:55.320> red<00:01:55.500> focus<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.070> things<00:01:56.250> but<00:01:56.729> one<00:01:56.880> thing

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
like red focus and things but one thing

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.569 
like red focus and things but one thing
I<00:01:57.210> didn't<00:01:57.570> touch<00:01:57.840> on<00:01:58.110> my<00:01:58.619> entire<00:01:58.920> tutorial<00:01:59.159> is

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
I didn't touch on my entire tutorial is

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.630 
I didn't touch on my entire tutorial is
actually<00:02:00.090> how<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.390> play<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.079> game<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.649> I

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
actually how to play the game and I

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.370 
actually how to play the game and I
really<00:02:03.270> really<00:02:03.540> think<00:02:03.689> there's<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.170> lot<00:02:04.320> of

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
really really think there's a lot of

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.810 
really really think there's a lot of
stuff<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.740> can<00:02:04.890> cover<00:02:05.040> for<00:02:05.340> those<00:02:05.399> topics

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
stuff I can cover for those topics

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.080 
stuff I can cover for those topics
things<00:02:06.509> like<00:02:06.750> zoning<00:02:07.229> footsies<00:02:08.220> all<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.910> kind

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
things like zoning footsies all the kind

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.240 
things like zoning footsies all the kind
of<00:02:09.149> stuff<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:10.020> spacing<00:02:10.530> game

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
of stuff the spacing game

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.280 
of stuff the spacing game
and<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:12.120> think<00:02:12.480> there's<00:02:12.630> a<00:02:12.690> lot<00:02:12.720> of<00:02:12.870> content

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
and I think there's a lot of content

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.800 
and I think there's a lot of content
there<00:02:13.580> so<00:02:14.580> yeah<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.850> main<00:02:15.000> focus<00:02:15.570> thing<00:02:15.720> I

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
there so yeah the main focus thing I

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.930 
there so yeah the main focus thing I
want<00:02:15.990> to<00:02:16.020> work<00:02:16.140> on<00:02:16.320> right<00:02:16.560> now<00:02:16.590> is<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.460> do

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
want to work on right now is to do

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.300 
want to work on right now is to do
another<00:02:18.510> entire<00:02:19.050> ultra<00:02:19.590> street<00:02:19.800> fighter<00:02:19.860> 4

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
tutorial so we can expect that in the

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.160 
tutorial so we can expect that in the
future<00:02:22.740> if<00:02:23.040> everything<00:02:23.610> goes<00:02:23.730> as<00:02:23.790> planned<00:02:24.170> the

to basically scour forms and stuff and
find<00:02:47.070> videos<00:02:47.520> back<00:02:47.730> then<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.150> just<00:02:48.209> get<00:02:48.510> you

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
find videos back then and just get you

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:49.699 
find videos back then and just get you
know<00:02:49.020> make<00:02:49.230> sure<00:02:49.380> that<00:02:49.530> my<00:02:49.650> character

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
know make sure that my character

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.150 
know make sure that my character
tutorials<00:02:50.610> are<00:02:50.760> perfect<00:02:51.209> but<00:02:52.050> uh<00:02:52.110> it<00:02:52.860> was<00:02:52.980> just

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
tutorials are perfect but uh it was just

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.040 
tutorials are perfect but uh it was just
so<00:02:53.310> tough<00:02:53.610> to<00:02:53.640> do<00:02:53.880> back<00:02:54.090> then<00:02:54.300> but<00:02:54.480> now<00:02:54.780> I

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
so tough to do back then but now I

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.830 
so tough to do back then but now I
really<00:02:55.530> think<00:02:55.560> I<00:02:55.830> can<00:02:55.890> tackle<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.459> because

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
really think I can tackle it because

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.210 
really think I can tackle it because
there's<00:02:57.840> just<00:02:58.020> so<00:02:58.200> much<00:02:58.410> content<00:02:58.980> out<00:02:59.190> there

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
there's just so much content out there

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.280 
there's just so much content out there
on<00:02:59.550> YouTube<00:02:59.700> and<00:03:00.120> we<00:03:00.239> got<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.570> brady<00:03:01.020> guide

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
on YouTube and we got the brady guide

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.560 
on YouTube and we got the brady guide
and<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.590> forms<00:03:02.040> or<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.310> little<00:03:02.760> better<00:03:02.940> for

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
and the forms or a little better for

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.120 
and the forms or a little better for
getting<00:03:03.780> a<00:03:03.810> content<00:03:04.200> I<00:03:04.290> really<00:03:04.620> think<00:03:04.800> I<00:03:04.950> can

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
getting a content I really think I can

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.250 
getting a content I really think I can
do<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.310> properly<00:03:05.820> now<00:03:06.060> so<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:06.840> guys<00:03:07.050> can

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
do it properly now so you guys can

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.720 
do it properly now so you guys can
expect<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.650> get<00:03:07.739> some<00:03:07.920> character<00:03:08.280> specific
