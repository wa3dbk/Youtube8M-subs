00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
still taking place and they fixed black

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.469 
still taking place and they fixed black
lines<00:01:41.099> on<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.340> sides<00:01:41.550> of<00:01:41.670> dolls<00:01:42.000> which<00:01:42.330> is

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
lines on the sides of dolls which is

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.969 
lines on the sides of dolls which is
nice<00:01:42.690> the<00:01:43.020> graphics<00:01:43.410> look<00:01:43.530> better<00:01:43.770> for<00:01:43.890> the

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
nice the graphics look better for the

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.570 
nice the graphics look better for the
doors<00:01:44.190> and<00:01:44.789> they<00:01:45.000> being<00:01:45.239> enabled<00:01:45.420> OpenGL

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
version 3 and MIT maps I think they were

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.510 
version 3 and MIT maps I think they were
slow<00:01:50.340> I'm<00:01:50.929> disabled<00:01:52.099> temporarily<00:01:53.099> as<00:01:53.399> they

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
slow I'm disabled temporarily as they

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.919 
slow I'm disabled temporarily as they
were<00:01:53.580> doing<00:01:53.700> testing<00:01:54.209> for<00:01:54.420> things<00:01:54.599> i<00:01:54.720> think<00:01:54.869> it

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
were doing testing for things i think it

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:56.270 
were doing testing for things i think it
was<00:01:54.989> causing<00:01:55.349> problems<00:01:55.739> for<00:01:55.800> some<00:01:55.979> devices

talking to yourself but you understand
the<00:02:10.200> concept<00:02:10.649> if<00:02:10.770> you<00:02:10.860> were<00:02:10.950> an<00:02:11.069> observer

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
the concept if you were an observer

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.280 
the concept if you were an observer
anything<00:02:12.090> like<00:02:12.209> that<00:02:12.239> if<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:13.050> were<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.170> open

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
anything like that if you were to open

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.809 
anything like that if you were to open
up<00:02:13.500> another<00:02:13.650> one<00:02:13.830> of<00:02:13.950> your<00:02:14.040> worlds<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.550> chat

up another one of your worlds the chat
log<00:02:15.030> would<00:02:15.330> still<00:02:15.540> be<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.930> same<00:02:15.959> but<00:02:16.680> now<00:02:16.890> it

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
log would still be the same but now it

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.740 
log would still be the same but now it
no<00:02:17.280> longer<00:02:17.310> does<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:18.030> which<00:02:18.150> makes<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.540> feel

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
no longer does that which makes it feel

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.260 
no longer does that which makes it feel

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270

the<00:02:23.640> option<00:02:24.150> screen<00:02:24.390> now<00:02:24.660> I<00:02:24.900> think<00:02:25.530> my<00:02:25.680> device

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
the option screen now I think my device

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.290 
the option screen now I think my device
is<00:02:26.280> having<00:02:26.520> issues<00:02:26.610> with<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:26.910> I<00:02:27.060> don't<00:02:27.240> know

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
is having issues with that I don't know

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.910 
is having issues with that I don't know
if<00:02:27.390> that's<00:02:27.600> completely<00:02:28.440> what<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.650> problem

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
if that's completely what the problem

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.680 
if that's completely what the problem
was<00:02:29.010> but<00:02:29.190> my<00:02:29.250> settings<00:02:29.790> are<00:02:29.910> always<00:02:30.240> jacked<00:02:30.480> up

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
was but my settings are always jacked up

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.870 
was but my settings are always jacked up
it's<00:02:30.870> like<00:02:30.930> every<00:02:31.560> single<00:02:31.800> bit<00:02:31.950> time<00:02:32.130> I<00:02:32.160> play<00:02:32.580> I

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
it's like every single bit time I play I

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.670 
it's like every single bit time I play I
have<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.450> redo<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.840> bunch<00:02:34.050> of<00:02:34.320> things<00:02:34.530> so

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
have to redo a bunch of things so

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.040 
have to redo a bunch of things so
hopefully<00:02:35.220> that<00:02:35.760> rules<00:02:36.120> out<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.360> issues<00:02:36.840> I've

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
hopefully that rules out the issues I've

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.410 
hopefully that rules out the issues I've
been<00:02:37.290> having<00:02:37.590> with<00:02:37.710> that<00:02:38.180> they<00:02:39.180> big

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
been having with that they big

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.910 
been having with that they big
sensitivity<00:02:40.110> lowering<00:02:40.530> itself

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
sensitivity lowering itself

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.280 
sensitivity lowering itself
automatically<00:02:41.760> I've<00:02:42.300> never<00:02:42.750> had<00:02:42.990> that<00:02:43.020> one

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
automatically I've never had that one

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.440 
automatically I've never had that one
happened<00:02:43.680> but<00:02:43.830> I<00:02:44.100> guess<00:02:44.580> someone<00:02:44.790> has<00:02:45.120> it's

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
happened but I guess someone has it's

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.380 
happened but I guess someone has it's
been<00:02:45.630> reported<00:02:45.930> um<00:02:46.380> they're<00:02:47.370> also<00:02:47.700> destroying

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
been reported um they're also destroying

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.630 
been reported um they're also destroying
a<00:02:48.570> door<00:02:48.810> by<00:02:49.020> removing<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.920> underlying<00:02:50.370> block

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
a door by removing the underlying block

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.090 
a door by removing the underlying block
now<00:02:50.940> correctly<00:02:51.360> yields<00:02:51.840> an<00:02:51.960> item<00:02:52.380> door<00:02:52.710> so

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
now correctly yields an item door so

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.670 
now correctly yields an item door so
basically<00:02:53.820> what<00:02:53.910> that<00:02:53.940> means<00:02:54.090> is<00:02:54.510> I'm<00:02:55.500> not

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
basically what that means is I'm not

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.080 
basically what that means is I'm not
sure<00:02:55.860> how<00:02:56.010> well<00:02:56.220> it<00:02:56.370> will<00:02:56.460> represent<00:02:56.640> in

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
sure how well it will represent in

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.510 
sure how well it will represent in
creative<00:02:57.660> mode<00:02:57.690> but<00:02:58.200> we'll<00:02:58.350> try<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.620> anyway<00:02:59.040> if

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
creative mode but we'll try it anyway if

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.680 
creative mode but we'll try it anyway if
you<00:02:59.610> were<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.760> place<00:02:59.940> a<00:02:59.970> door<00:03:00.270> here<00:03:00.510> what

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
you were to place a door here what

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:01.790 
you were to place a door here what
they're<00:03:00.840> saying<00:03:01.080> is<00:03:01.230> if<00:03:01.350> you<00:03:01.410> were<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.620> break

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
they're saying is if you were to break

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.190 
they're saying is if you were to break
the<00:03:02.040> block<00:03:02.250> below<00:03:02.460> the<00:03:02.730> door<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:03.180> door<00:03:03.780> was<00:03:04.050> not

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
the block below the door a door was not

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.750 
the block below the door a door was not
popping<00:03:04.590> out<00:03:04.740> but<00:03:04.980> now<00:03:05.070> you<00:03:05.130> can<00:03:05.370> see<00:03:05.490> the<00:03:05.610> door

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
popping out but now you can see the door

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.430 
popping out but now you can see the door
pops<00:03:06.000> out<00:03:06.240> so<00:03:06.660> basically<00:03:06.930> it<00:03:07.050> was<00:03:07.110> destroying

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
pops out so basically it was destroying

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.720 
pops out so basically it was destroying
the<00:03:07.620> door<00:03:07.830> by<00:03:08.070> destroying<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.520> block

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
the door by destroying the block

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.190 
the door by destroying the block
underneath<00:03:09.000> so<00:03:09.210> they<00:03:09.300> fix<00:03:09.540> that<00:03:09.780> completely

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
underneath so they fix that completely

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.410 
underneath so they fix that completely
as<00:03:10.380> you<00:03:10.470> could<00:03:10.620> see<00:03:10.650> there<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.880> that<00:03:12.090> is<00:03:12.120> the

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
as you could see there and that is the

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.210 
as you could see there and that is the
end<00:03:12.600> of<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.990> changelog<00:03:13.470> so<00:03:13.680> you<00:03:13.740> like<00:03:13.920> I<00:03:14.040> said

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
end of the changelog so you like I said

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.460 
end of the changelog so you like I said
it's<00:03:14.370> actually<00:03:14.700> rather<00:03:15.000> small<00:03:15.510> list<00:03:15.870> for

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
it's actually rather small list for

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.080 
it's actually rather small list for
changelogs<00:03:16.890> but<00:03:17.130> that's<00:03:17.280> a<00:03:17.430> good<00:03:17.640> sign<00:03:17.910> it

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
changelogs but that's a good sign it

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.520 
changelogs but that's a good sign it
means<00:03:18.120> they're<00:03:18.390> getting<00:03:18.600> very<00:03:18.870> close<00:03:19.140> to

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
means they're getting very close to

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.230 
means they're getting very close to
having<00:03:20.070> this<00:03:20.280> ready<00:03:20.490> enough<00:03:20.730> to<00:03:20.880> publicly

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240
