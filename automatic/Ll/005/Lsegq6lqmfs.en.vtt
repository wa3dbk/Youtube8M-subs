this device can be used with the app and

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.480 
this device can be used with the app and
I'll<00:01:36.450> bring<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.780> app<00:01:36.899> up<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:38.069> show<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.340> a

I'll bring the app up to show you a

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.910 
I'll bring the app up to show you a
patient's<00:01:39.030> electrocardiogram<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.590> can<00:01:40.799> be

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
patient's electrocardiogram that can be

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.489

a<00:01:47.250> stethoscope<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:48.000> fact<00:01:48.599> we<00:01:49.079> call<00:01:49.319> it<00:01:49.469> an<00:01:49.590> ECG

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
a stethoscope in fact we call it an ECG

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.059 
a stethoscope in fact we call it an ECG
stethoscope<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:50.969> so<00:01:51.569> we<00:01:51.990> can<00:01:52.140> analyze<00:01:52.349> store

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069 
stethoscope and so we can analyze store

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:55.520

and do an immediate rhythm evaluation on

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.970 
and do an immediate rhythm evaluation on
that<00:02:36.630> patient<00:02:36.900> before<00:02:37.410> they're<00:02:37.739> able<00:02:37.769> to
