00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 again, dear friends with you developers 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.020
 today we'll talk for the program on 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.330
 smartphone and for platforms like ios and 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.040
 android namely the program which 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.139
 will be able to complement our reality and 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.170
 exhibits some kind of three-dimensional 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.210
 animated models our life 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.859
 Well let's start with the menu and 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.740
 First I would like to add that 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.980
 the program is absolutely free and yes 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.830
 let's start with the menu 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.080
 the first button or link is with whom to 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.320
 scan surfaces namely 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.230
 exactly qr-code or marker - on the picture 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.710
 on which we will display our 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.870
 models 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.129
 explorer ie model search and login 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.480
 so that you can log in through 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.600
 facebook or e-mail 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.289
 and then there already create models therefore 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.059
 let's click on the scan would like to 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.690
 add him to use this 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.760
 the program 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.399
 absolutely not necessarily special 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:02.940
 the picture that just now turn on 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:05.640
 the program works best 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.420
 it is on her and let's choose 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.430
 figure like a mazing animal troll call her 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.240
 exactly and choose i will show you that of 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.430
 represents himself 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.520
 it will be loaded for a little while 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.780
 because it is animated 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.740
 animation model that day and here 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.009
 not so much but still 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.990
 animated models are there and she will be well 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.600
 as if a little long loaded because 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.420
 which is pretty high quality model now 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.180
 everything will be a little podlagivaet here we are 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.840
 move it and we got here 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.000
 so here 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.340
 troll so as not to fall remove too much 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.560
 so this troll that is, it works 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.909
 exactly here on this very picture this 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.460
 picture can be downloaded and used 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.310
 It is the application that we can assume 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.229
 knew such games on playstation on vita 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.060
 or psp 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.100
 extra reality here 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.140
 They are called differently I know 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.810
 let's say one ipad is like tamagotchi 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.240
 with the help of special cards we lay down 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.770
 card and 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.250
 through the chamber is found similar images 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.009
 this image you can find where 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.410
 want that is let's say in google search 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.070
 pictures and so on so what 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.870
 now let me post then I will tell 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.480
 you how it will be possible to withdraw such 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.100
 pictures on regular drives if you don't have 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.470
 here such it can be downloaded 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.800
 free print 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.630
 that is, we can move our model 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.330
 show or hide shadows but for some reason 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.910
 here the shadow is just such a square given 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.560
 versions on apple of course the element is better 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.660
 because on this as always I do everything 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.490
 a little better than on android therefore 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.820
 here instead of the shadow here is such a square 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.860
 appears but it is not on all models here 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.400
 this model has its own you 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:53.880
 shadow yes that is we can do our 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.600
 models all we want to see it with 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.500
 all sides 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.390
 take a closer look at the camera 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.790
 animated and three-dimensional you yourself can 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.460
 make such a model for example in 3d max 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.360
 and i can also fill in here 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:14.550
 our model make her more god 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:18.150
 how big and move and let's 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.760
 slightly reduce here so this is our very 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.709
 augmented reality model so 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.120
 say and now let's try 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:29.010
 remove our tablet with our model 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.230
 the model is gone and you saw it 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.680
 followed the tablet and try 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.860
 Now 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.750
 work here are such a disk from this 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.209
 gum now we see we put it on 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.390
 drive our model for that you need to click 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.980
 on the key to create a marker here we need 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.840
 will put buy a poster and 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.820
 fill them with a screen and then click when 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.320
 light up green in the description is written 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.660
 you need to be sure that something is not 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.470
 pour ashe and for some reason 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.930
 did not try 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.209
 and books and boxes from board games and 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.970
 all sorts of posters are mostly with me 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.430
 reacted only to this disk already 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.260
 close 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.890
 then of course you have to with this pastor 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.890
 tinker a little 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.150
 everything went kind of pretty good and 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.040
 Now our what will be displayed on this 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.959
 disk what it means it may not be 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.959
 notebook sheet the most important thing is that he 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.790
 fit but would like to say that on 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.160
 display this disc is not very good and 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.750
 best displayed on the image either 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.560
 his printouts either output through 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.450
 tablet well 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.160
 like threads differently because given 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.730
 the image will constantly flicker she 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.650
 will more often disappear here if we 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.780
 let's turn it on like everything is in order 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.210
 turns over but disappears quickly and 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.210
 so on and does not appear quickly but necessary 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:46.120
 bring up like this and so on yes that is 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.040
 here's a little tank small yes I think 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.669
 moody's Kopeisk remove avatar blooms 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:55.060
 if of course you are interested and come back 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:57.240
 to our review namely on the tablet with 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.490
 this picture 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.080
 so here it is but it immediately appeared 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.690
 there is no need to add any markers 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.060
 there is also a screenshots feature then 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:12.790
 there is let's say I want to increase it about 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:16.389
 small what's his here and because 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:19.930
 screenshot sieve deal all yes that is with us 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:22.450
 A screenshot appears, that is, we can also 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.850
 consider our being on a by clicking on 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:28.060
 button 3 trees on all sides of it 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:33.430
 consider also need to move it 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:35.500
 was that we know that we have here that 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.360
 we will now have output 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.100
 back to the main menu here we have 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.970
 There is such a bullshit which is in many 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.530
 social networks 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:46.360
 here we can login through 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:49.060
 Facebook also has nominations so to speak 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:52.390
 about the nomination of the best models here 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:56.440
 there are stories all that well, we can 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:06:00.039
 add your models yes there is a search we 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.180
 we can find the model we need 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:01.510
 it seems there is a very interesting one 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.979
 model 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:07.360
 I remember how Hans doubles the mecca 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:09.700
 court i don't remember how to spell khan courts 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.710
 it's a character with some kind of anemia not exactly 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.660
 I remember from which one I don’t answer directly 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.490
 I remember from what you can try 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:18.310
 use some other model not 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:20.350
 everything is not all animated and no 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:24.970
 animated moves much slower 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:30.520
 that is, let him miss such a machine 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:32.879
 I have never tried quickly 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.229
 there is immediately clear that the animation is different 

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:37.030
 drawing to pretty not bother 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:40.270
 although at ninety percent she 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:44.440
 a little podlagivaet here everything appeared 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:47.020
 Our car is small. By the way, we can doctor 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.900
 can also rotate by pressing differently 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:52.150
 on the rotate button that's our shadow machine 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.069
 we hide so about play market i 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.729
 already said that the application is free and 

00:06:54.069 --> 00:07:01.319
 here about the appstore I do not know because 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:05.259
 in the app you do not really like there even 

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:06.849
 Type there play the market is written with this 

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:08.560
 set as well as with this 

00:07:06.849 --> 00:07:11.440
 sets this up when output 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.610
 type of dogs with an application well, how do you finish 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.880
 to this app in the appstore 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:17.770
 our customers also buy this 

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.470
 On I was of course rarely work therefore 

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:22.110
 I can't say much 

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:23.729
 Well, such a thing is called 

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:26.590
 extra reality 

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:27.880
 program and jam and reality in the market you 

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:30.639
 can download on your own 

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.860
 see above the name and you were 

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:36.240
 the developer is a review so wonderful 

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.240
 all programs for now
