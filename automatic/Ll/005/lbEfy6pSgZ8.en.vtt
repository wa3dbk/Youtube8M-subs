00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello I'm klaus rinke cordially 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.259
 welcome to the video blog astro 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.330
 easy navigation you are already 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.420
 fascinated by the possibility only after 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.250
 to navigate the stars to the sun 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.740
 you somehow hold the astro navigation 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.230
 for something mysterious something for higher wine 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.490
 are necessary 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.020
 Perhaps you ask yourself and the 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.650
 navigate trailing at all 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.810
 Contemporary is today in the time of gps 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.670
 then you are right here goal of the blog 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.380
 it is too close to some of the myths 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.809
 they are all about the astro navigation 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.280
 you just did not have to run 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.620
 have understood everything about 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.180
 to understand navigation before you 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.629
 you to the supposedly highest level 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.710
 the asso navigation is allowed to approach 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.570
 I claim who 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.090
 sport boat license has passed 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.420
 he has enough basic knowledge about himself 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.640
 to venture to the astro navigation 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.680
 you do not need a higher math if 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.980
 you can add and subtract 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.180
 that is perfectly adequate 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.699
 myths with which I am right now 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.979
 want to clean up they sank around the question 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.409
 do i need the asso navigation in the 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.830
 actually my time today 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.330
 answer to that is clearly no 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.490
 does one or the other now too 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.250
 amaze me just like that 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.900
 to hear in this blog but that one 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.280
 the astro navigation does not need 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.400
 does not mean that they are not 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.750
 authority would be quite the opposite 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.400
 But let's start with the first 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.310
 standard sayings to the everywhere 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.640
 be called as a gps device can 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.409
 break down 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:40.710
 so could such a handheld device as this 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:42.180
 fall in this case recommend 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.619
 I pick it up again 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.689
 that should have been it then 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.210
 however, a sextant falls down then 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.020
 he is definitely broken because of that 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.280
 I prefer not to do this 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.899
 but demonstrate electronic devices 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.799
 You can break it without it 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.560
 fall under this 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.090
 that's interesting here is that 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.590
 nowadays for the necessary 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.940
 calculations at the astro navigation 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.040
 such a program 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.570
 calculator is also used 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.730
 By the way, in the exams of the German 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.990
 Sailor's Association and this calculator is 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.740
 not even waterproof so who 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.750
 abysmal distrust against 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.700
 electronic has instead of 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.510
 pocket calculator prefer such tables 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:28.230
 use and above all things never in 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.230
 to climb a plane 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.120
 Still, I would never go with just one gps 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.950
 drive across the Atlantic as well 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.870
 I never with only one sextant 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.480
 would have driven over the Atlantic 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.250
 when there was no gp we had 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.460
 always two sextants on board if we 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.780
 at that time was on a big trip 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.880
 we also like to point out that 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.550
 GPS is an American system 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.450
 which at any time from 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.360
 Ministry of Defense switched off 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.980
 Now it could be that but then 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.850
 usa and the entire western world 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.860
 paralyze 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.990
 no plane could start more 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.150
 container are loaded and many 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.060
 other things without gps not today 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.320
 more conceivable are impossible 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.380
 in other words i hold this 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.970
 risk for calculable and should 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.489
 actually during a global 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.530
 nuclear war gps be shut down or 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.709
 fail then you have all the way 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.850
 other problems 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.620
 what happened is that 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.709
 fleet associations in their immediate 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.959
 surrounding the GPS signal then disturb 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.180
 you if you happen to be near for 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.400
 a short time no gps available 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.330
 you have the problem synonymous with the astro 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.920
 navigation when the sky is cloudy 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.290
 Nevertheless, I am by no means against astro 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.190
 navigation on the contrary I am one 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.590
 real fan 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:48.330
 it is so that the questions 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.560
 Do not ask about the need 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.350
 take a look at this beautiful ship 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.690
 my wife did it a few years ago 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.370
 It was photographed on the Baltic Sea 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.530
 really gorgeous sight like this 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.680
 ship in a splendid weather parallel 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.390
 broken in schlei to us that is what 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.390
 are your thoughts applied is closes 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.280
 that is not up-to-date anymore 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.830
 Sails should be made of carbon or at least 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.840
 basements are with the cloth that he up 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.200
 he never gets an optimal 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.940
 performance or the hull of the would be in 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.060
 a plastic sandwich construction lot 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.160
 lighter the rigging can not be 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.360
 trim enough 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.169
 In addition, the top weight by the 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.479
 Gasse too high and even one 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.840
 wing boat with a neat 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:36.729
 Drive machine would be much faster 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.930
 Now that help hardly your thoughts that 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.690
 were not crying too 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.669
 But let's not fool ourselves who follows 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.310
 the need for astro navigation 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.710
 also needs to ask about the need 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.850
 ask the sail 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.070
 I am about the time ago 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.740
 Atlantic sailed and it was great me 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:56.020
 Anyone can guess this too 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.430
 if he has the opportunity but 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.970
 I can also assure you of that 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.860
 return flight 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.030
 So I have the boat on the Caribbean 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.640
 leave in the caribbean 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.550
 the return flight was faster and cheaper 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:09.370
 comfortable so I see that synonymous with the 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.380
 astro navigation the fact that you 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.720
 with gps on a few meters exactly the 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.210
 position can not take me 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.860
 of the fascination only with the help of 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.690
 sun to determine the position 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.580
 so already our ancestors before 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.770
 have made a long time around your way 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.690
 to find over the seas 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.940
 it is not necessary but one 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.180
 art and it is not nearly so 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.590
 difficult as generally believed 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.000
 the fascination is transmitted in the 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.669
 general also with the 10th 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.530
 if you your sextants from the bast 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:41.310
 to shoot sun then grab yours 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:45.060
 cameras to take a picture 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:47.530
 I have a lot of such photos 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.160
 and so will it be with you when you 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.450
 Today I am concerned with the topic 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.039
 Now if you only care about the photo 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.490
 then you can of course finish here 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:56.500
 do 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.599
 otherwise I'm looking forward to the next one 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.450
 times when it's about the coordinate system 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:02.890
 the horizon is much on 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.349
 complicated expression for what 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.349
 actually behind it 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:07.349
 bye
