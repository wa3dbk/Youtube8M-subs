00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.570
 do not 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.570
 ah 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.360
 how many times have we not asked 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.040
 how that trunk is made where we keep 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.500
 the helmets or that suitcase that 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.960
 we transport in our trips today 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.000
 we visited the sat company for many 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.279
 unknown a leading Spanish company 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.660
 in this segment there they will show us how 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.880
 these elements are manufactured 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.380
 this is the prototype section here is 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.390
 where the life of a seat begins 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.770
 if this is really where the 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.050
 life of a seat in this section what 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.440
 what we do is we start from the first 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.270
 line that a customer can bring us 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.859
 from here we elaborate all the 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.829
 pieces by hand a mess we have is a 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:42.750
 base normally made the material of 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.820
 mold and the rest is a foam that we're going 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.969
 working by hand until we get 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.559
 get the form that the client can 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.449
 desire and give the level of comfort 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.789
 necessary and then afterwards we created 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.219
 the cover this can give us that we get 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.629
 have it in the first five pieces what 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.399
 that maybe we have to do fifteen 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.109
 or twenty until we get to have the 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.600
 perfect piece to be able to be 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.489
 industrialized once it is designed what 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.500
 manufactures jce let's see how it is manufactured 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.660
 here the manufacturing process starts 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.700
 of a seat tell us how it works 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.710
 well this is the injection process of 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.960
 foam we are in front of the carousel 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.299
 the foam is a carousel with 16 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.340
 different positions in each of 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.320
 they inject a foam model 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.759
 different in definite of the foam is 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.939
 an isocyanate soft composition 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.860
 polyols in a different ratio in the 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.439
 which will we obtain different hardness 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.600
 in each of the seats is for 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.939
 different types of motorcycle at the same time not yes 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.799
 yes this carousel has those 16 says 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.210
 different positions because 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.100
 evidently in each of them 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.610
 we inject a seat model 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.610
 different 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.950
 this is the process of marking by high 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.210
 frequency of the covers this machine what 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.340
 that you have here is an electrode in the 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.680
 which you can see the mark that our 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.020
 customer demands we can use 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.610
 serigraphs we can use marking by 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.950
 electrodes even this machine we 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.940
 can serve to make another type of 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.040
 different solders in which 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.510
 we could suppress a stitching like this 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.190
 welding where we have to have 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.110
 here in which you can observe that no 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.790
 We have no sewing level but we 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.220
 we have simply managed to melt the 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.959
 two plastics through heat and this is 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.330
 the final phase of a seat upholstery 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.070
 it means we have seen how 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.959
 we injected the foam we know that the 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.700
 injection base comes to us from the 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.080
 outside and we have also seen how it 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.610
 made a cover at the level of 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.550
 sewn now the only thing we do is 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.170
 assemble those three parts and the 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.850
 we record to the base of the seat with 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.980
 order to get a seat completely 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.310
 finished and ready to send to 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.310
 client 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.470
 we do not know that he has several trunks 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.940
 own manufacturing what is not 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.709
 we knew is that he manufactured for many 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.110
 important brands as an accessory 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.670
 original if done right now we are 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.150
 precisely in the assembly line of 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.910
 the product lines om 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.800
 us as a manufacturer of seat suitcases 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.209
 We have been around for about 20 years 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.030
 in fact this year we celebrated 20 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.310
 anniversary but as a manufacturer 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.140
 of motorcycle saddles we have 40 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.940
 that means we 've counted one 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.130
 little the two parts the part of our 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.209
 know-how in chad and our manufacturing and 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.610
 market knowledge 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.550
 motorcycle to be able to offer 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.510
 our regular customers 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.430
 different products that we develop 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.500
 completely in this company we 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.900
 we participate in themes of ccoo design 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.170
 from the start of the project until the 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.700
 product goes on the market or is in fact 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.680
 many of those trunks some design is 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.140
 your others participate the brands of 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.510
 this design if we have a little bit of everything 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.980
 deep down we are capable 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.480
 to offer to the customer as soon as possible 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.760
 come with a line and develop 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.860
 completely until you can attract a 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.720
 product fully developed and 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.140
 we put manufacturing manufacture 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.210
 all 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.319
 of accessories for this we like more the 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.530
 first option because we always 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:12.560
 allows to work the reverse technology 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.450
 It allows us to work in a better way and 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.970
 especially to be able to contribute everything was angry 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.419
 a customer many of the users are 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:23.000
 will ask what happens with the guarantee of 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.919
 these trunks vibrates a lot especially the 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.919
 people who make a roll receive many 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.330
 vibrations how this good is prepared 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:31.580
 us when we develop a 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.590
 product what we always do between 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.820
 another three is a vibration test in 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.100
 this test what we do is the 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.800
 simulation of what would happen to the motorcycle 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.380
 of the end user when 100 have passed 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.410
 thousand kilometers this test is done with 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.240
 weight of 3 kilos or without weight and there we noticed 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.880
 if there is resonance or vibration on the motorcycle 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.070
 which allows us to correct some 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.200
 way our product to get 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.720
 take a product to the market that is in 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.030
 the conditions in necessary to be able 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.690
 circular we have already seen the process of 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.550
 manufacturing 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.290
 but of course where it stores is all this 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.970
 what it makes is good because all this 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.220
 we store it in this warehouse 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.260
 We have a warehouse of approximately 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.880
 about 30,000 cubic meters 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.220
 and we have divided into two parts 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.170
 part of traditional warehouse and a part 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.030
 from smart store here we have some 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.920
 heights of 16 and a half meters connected 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.300
 with a factory with which what we do 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.010
 it's all the material that ends up coming to 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.900
 stop inside this warehouse and leave 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.780
 from here we issue our clients to 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.460
 The different types of customers are 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:31.640
 customers dealers directly or 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:35.420
 be importers in the countries that 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:38.720
 that we have presence as was born sad 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:41.300
 was born in a moment of crisis too 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.290
 as always things are done in the 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.290
 that I decided 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.840
 but start making seats for 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:54.040
 motorcycle that was one thing that in this 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:58.200
 who catalonia in the time of the 70s 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:06:00.940
 there were many manufacturers and they had 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.730
 capital possibilities in some 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:08.430
 blacks when little by little he came to 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:12.220
 rejoice of the 90 that Spain and Europe 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:14.620
 Europe was a continent with great 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.870
 possibilities and we in the 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:19.720
 camp with the decision that 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:21.850
 our market ceased to be the pure 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.840
 market spain baltasar the market 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.000
 European 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:28.180
 when the epicenter of our 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:32.860
 activities would have to be had 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:37.650
 to be located between Milan Paris and 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:39.249
 munich until today we are in Europe the 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:42.189
 leaders 

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:44.709
 of making seats and staying 

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:47.739
 also diverse in the manufacture of trunks 

00:06:44.709 --> 00:06:49.239
 for children teams if you are a 

00:06:47.739 --> 00:06:51.309
 company that has also always been 

00:06:49.239 --> 00:06:52.959
 looking to the future we see it by 

00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:57.759
 example with the new products of the 

00:06:52.959 --> 00:07:00.789
 upac I do not know if this this was that 

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:04.509
 we had also been trying for years 

00:07:00.789 --> 00:07:08.379
 a bag type product and we did it 

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:11.079
 along with Asian people who had little 

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:13.749
 experience that contributed little and even 

00:07:11.079 --> 00:07:17.559
 that we found ass pack that are about 

00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:19.239
 very good professionals and the 

00:07:17.559 --> 00:07:21.729
 inertias that we have been able to create between 

00:07:19.239 --> 00:07:24.669
 the two and between the two companies this 

00:07:21.729 --> 00:07:26.499
 is giving us very good results because 

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:28.449
 now they are great professionals in the 

00:07:26.499 --> 00:07:30.849
 bags that we know very well 

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:34.709
 the sector of the motorcycle thank you very much 

00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:34.709
 to you
