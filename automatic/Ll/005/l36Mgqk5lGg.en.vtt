00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
i'll just throw in the the other way

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.090 
i'll just throw in the the other way
first<00:00:52.269> so<00:00:52.540> the<00:00:53.019> regular<00:00:53.170> deck<00:00:53.589> i'm<00:00:53.769> not<00:00:53.890> sure

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
first so the regular deck i'm not sure

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.950 
first so the regular deck i'm not sure
which<00:00:54.280> is<00:00:54.309> which<00:00:54.699> this<00:00:55.180> is<00:00:55.330> here<00:00:55.540> this<00:00:55.809> one

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
which is which this is here this one

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.380 
which is which this is here this one
belongs<00:00:56.229> to<00:00:56.379> my<00:00:56.949> extra<00:00:57.220> cart<00:00:57.489> and<00:00:57.760> I'm<00:00:58.239> it

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
belongs to my extra cart and I'm it

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.780 
belongs to my extra cart and I'm it
doesn't<00:00:58.629> matter<00:00:58.750> which<00:00:58.989> cards<00:00:59.440> or<00:01:00.010> when<00:01:00.729> you

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
doesn't matter which cards or when you

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:01.829 
doesn't matter which cards or when you
do<00:01:00.909> it<00:01:01.000> this<00:01:01.030> way<00:01:01.239> doesn't<00:01:01.420> matter<00:01:01.570> with<00:01:01.809> which

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
do it this way doesn't matter with which

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:05.789 
do it this way doesn't matter with which
cards<00:01:02.409> are<00:01:02.500> where<00:01:02.699> because<00:01:04.379> Mick<00:01:05.379> so<00:01:05.560> doesn't

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
cards are where because Mick so doesn't

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.740 
cards are where because Mick so doesn't
matter<00:01:05.920> so<00:01:06.580> shove<00:01:06.820> the<00:01:06.939> deck<00:01:07.119> up<00:01:07.299> until<00:01:07.630> you're

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
matter so shove the deck up until you're

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.070 
matter so shove the deck up until you're
ready<00:01:07.900> and<00:01:08.170> then<00:01:08.860> all<00:01:09.070> you<00:01:09.159> do<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:10.810> you<00:01:10.960> to

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
ready and then all you do is you to

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.660 
ready and then all you do is you to
perform<00:01:11.230> was<00:01:11.590> a<00:01:11.620> double<00:01:11.980> lift<00:01:12.130> and<00:01:12.340> I<00:01:12.400> might've

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
perform was a double lift and I might've

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.010 
perform was a double lift and I might've
I<00:01:12.940> probably<00:01:13.270> get<00:01:13.510> a<00:01:13.540> swimming<00:01:13.870> performance

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
I probably get a swimming performance

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.620 
I probably get a swimming performance
because<00:01:14.650> double<00:01:15.430> lifting<00:01:15.790> I'm<00:01:16.240> not<00:01:16.390> that

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
because double lifting I'm not that

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.630 
because double lifting I'm not that
great<00:01:16.810> with<00:01:16.930> I'm<00:01:17.710> right<00:01:18.010> at<00:01:18.130> the<00:01:18.220> bat<00:01:18.430> I

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
great with I'm right at the bat I

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.100 
great with I'm right at the bat I
usually<00:01:19.150> make<00:01:19.240> mistake<00:01:19.690> unless<00:01:19.870> some

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
usually make mistake unless some

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.810 
usually make mistake unless some
practice<00:01:20.470> in<00:01:20.560> it<00:01:20.680> for<00:01:20.830> a<00:01:20.890> bit<00:01:21.040> so<00:01:21.520> basically

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
practice in it for a bit so basically

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.640 
practice in it for a bit so basically
what<00:01:22.000> double<00:01:22.300> lift<00:01:22.450> is<00:01:22.750> you're<00:01:22.930> taking<00:01:23.560> the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
what double lift is you're taking the

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:24.930 
what double lift is you're taking the
two<00:01:23.800> cars<00:01:24.100> and<00:01:24.340> you're<00:01:24.430> flipping<00:01:24.790> them<00:01:24.880> over

really confusing because all of a sudden
they<00:03:10.430> have<00:03:10.640> the<00:03:11.600> cars<00:03:11.870> in<00:03:12.049> the<00:03:12.260> magician's

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
they have the cars in the magician's

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.650 
they have the cars in the magician's
pocket<00:03:13.010> in<00:03:13.100> their<00:03:13.190> hand<00:03:13.400> and<00:03:13.610> their<00:03:14.329> card

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
pocket in their hand and their card

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.069 
pocket in their hand and their card
isn't<00:03:15.500> even<00:03:15.769> anywhere<00:03:16.459> so<00:03:16.760> that's<00:03:16.970> one<00:03:17.930> way<00:03:17.959> to

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
isn't even anywhere so that's one way to

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.800 
isn't even anywhere so that's one way to
do<00:03:18.290> it<00:03:18.700> so<00:03:19.700> if<00:03:19.790> you<00:03:19.880> make<00:03:20.090> it<00:03:20.120> confusing<00:03:20.510> like

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
do it so if you make it confusing like

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.090 
do it so if you make it confusing like
that<00:03:20.959> that's<00:03:21.110> a<00:03:21.170> good<00:03:21.290> way<00:03:21.350> to<00:03:21.440> do<00:03:21.560> it<00:03:21.680> the

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
that that's a good way to do it the

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.590 
that that's a good way to do it the
other<00:03:22.160> way<00:03:22.280> to<00:03:22.400> do<00:03:22.549> it<00:03:22.700> on<00:03:22.910> like<00:03:23.120> I<00:03:23.209> said<00:03:23.420> was

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
other way to do it on like I said was

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.560 
other way to do it on like I said was
with<00:03:23.810> the<00:03:24.049> double<00:03:24.769> card<00:03:25.060> all<00:03:26.060> you<00:03:26.299> got<00:03:26.390> to<00:03:26.420> do
