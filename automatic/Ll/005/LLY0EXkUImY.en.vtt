00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.940
 new video to everyone who knows me 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.690
 You already know that I'm Itzel and those who do not 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.269

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.379
 I am a chef on this day before 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.269
 let's start with this one 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:17.280
 I want to tell you that the weather here in 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.270
 the city of mexico has been crazy 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.270
 has been water 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:37.010
 good let's start with this such the tar 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.010
 today it is called 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.429
 they call diseases of books and 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.430
 it's a tag that I saw in the rise channel 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:49.620
 up from root to reveles 99 I'll leave you 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.620
 your channel here if we go with the video 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.070
 I already have a good chair this tag 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.470
 consists of saying several diseases and 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.510
 then a book that fits these 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.000
 diseases the first disease 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.070
 that I have is good diabetes not the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.770
 I have but you have the tag or that 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.229
 I hope the first disease is diabetes 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.390
 and it is a book that is very very sweet for 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.030
 this category choose the books in 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.590
 general of 'twilight' and so I 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.300
 missing the 'twilight' euro person 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.040
 He stopped lending and I have not returned it 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.290
 well these books really are 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.090
 too sweet I feel because these 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.190
 books can be summarized something like that or 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.360
 edward and so you are a vampire but 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.270

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.759
 then edward I can not live without you 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.100
 I love you, it matters that we have 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.220
 a daughter from the store our friends 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.240
 let's dedicate ourselves or our love something like that 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.640
 second category is chicken pox 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.070
 how is this marisela chair showing 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.869
 a book you read once and never 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.750
 never in life will the 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.180
 Siddhartha books and gay germán 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.000
 demián de hermann hesse and I do not say that of 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.229
 that hermann hesse is bad but if 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.110
 you're not used to this kind of 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.020
 reading as a loose philosophical analytic 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.729
 a bit of not recommended for 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.619
 people who are just beginning to 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.190
 read everything once is enough 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.060
 third question is about influenza a 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.370
 book 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.910
 I wanted to be in the recording I'm sorry 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.790
 so much good to the next question is 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.470
 influenza a book that looks like a 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.270
 well all the series that are going to have 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.709
 a movie or any book you see 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.690
 has a movie spreads 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.280
 quickly like a virus you feel 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.010
 very good for having found a book 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.870
 that you found it very entertaining and very 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.940
 father and you start recommending him 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.560
 everywhere and suddenly you realize 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.510
 that they are going to make a movie and that 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.310
 the whole background is already reading and everything 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.310
 the world already has it and you are like that 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.290
 first law before everyone else 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.690
 respect these things the next 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.130
 category is the cycle a book that is 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.650
 every month every year 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.020
 repeated in my illness does not have a 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.150
 name I think it could be half 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.990
 the saga that represents this disease 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.640
 is the books of Harry Potter 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.320
 look what happened to my book a 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.340
 week after I buy it 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.340
 pay close attention 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.620
 in the books of Harry Potter when I 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.140
 a child and were in vogue all 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.300
 books and all those things I read them 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.400
 many times I finished reading the 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.709
 series and I started it again for 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.290
 a very sociable girl that we say more the 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.300
 next category is insomnia is a 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.190
 book that kept you awake all the 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.959
 night and good to me there are books that I 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.030
 They keep you awake all night because 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.769
 I like them a lot and like they nailed me 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.980
 much in the story of the 'floor read and it's 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:43.099
 so not to compare that they finished it 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.470
 but some especially so I 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.750
 sleep deprived are usually the 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.030
 dan brown books and those of jon cats and 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.819
 more now I do not have many copies 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.489
 of them because I lent them almost all 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:58.760
 most of those from Jon Katzman me 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:00.950
 they keep awake and that is the suspense 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.049
 that he drives this canyon are the 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.000
 books that I finish reading I follow 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.849
 thinking about the story now we go with 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.130
 amnesia a book that you forgot that 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:12.290
 you had read and that you had read in this 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.420
 category I have the book of the second 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.579
 second life skill of bree 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.500
 tanner written by stephenie meyer and not 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.000
 it's because I do not like it though 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.340
 once someone talks about it or that 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.470
 they comment on themselves as if to me 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.979
 forget that I read it I do not know why the 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:30.050
 next category asthma a book that you 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.240
 stole the breath these books are from the 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.389
 most repeated books in all videos 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:39.400
 I believe but it was the burning book 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:42.919
 of the trilogy of the post of hunger and 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:45.350
 definitely harry potter 7 one of 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:47.419
 the best finals and I had been able 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.190
 read in a series if he was in the 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.169
 last pages when they were 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.940
 revealing the whole truth and the whole end 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.940
 and all that was like a 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.320
 we go with the following malnutrition a 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:04.520
 book that lacked food for the 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:06.380
 brain of bless by tonya hurley and ok yo 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.300
 I know that my first video I said that I 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.789
 I was dying to have a book and that 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.610
 I had read and all that I read the first 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:15.530
 chapters and they were very very well but 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.389
 as the story that 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.240
 we really did not understand that it is a 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:21.580
 bad story 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.009
 rather I think it was misspelled 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.349
 I feel like the story is written 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:29.560
 very quickly and does not give you time as 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:31.690
 to process the information as of 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:36.060
 find a meaning, that is, if you believe it 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.060
 in the things that are happening 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.190
 and if really a pity because I 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:44.289
 I really like the art that the book has 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.900
 that attracts from the first moment ay me 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:48.520
 liked the cover very much and also has 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.169
 Other illustrations have some 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.620
 very nice decorations 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:57.370
 there are some pages that are decorated 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.350
 and between and last question is whether net yes 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:03.610
 is a book that took you on a trip to 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:04.419
 through time and space and ok in 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.850
 this category 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:09.340
 I think all the books are already going to me 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.990
 on a journey through time and of 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.810
 space one of the things that most 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:16.630
 like to read that while you read that 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:20.310
 be 20-30 minutes or the time that you 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:22.060
 have in the day takes you to 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.330
 transport you to all situations 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.979
 who are telling you and really always 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.740
 it's a journey through time and the 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:32.320
 space in each book even if it's bad 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:34.120
 good thanks for the video remember that 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.400
