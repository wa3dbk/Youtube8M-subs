being<00:01:23.409> why<00:01:24.409> after<00:01:24.770> there<00:01:25.010> are<00:01:25.100> all<00:01:25.310> the

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
being why after there are all the

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.400 
being why after there are all the
hundreds<00:01:26.000> of<00:01:26.090> unboxing<00:01:26.690> videos<00:01:27.020> that<00:01:27.320> were

hundreds of unboxing videos that were

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.160 
hundreds of unboxing videos that were
online<00:01:27.590> I'm<00:01:28.010> not<00:01:28.100> doing<00:01:28.280> another<00:01:29.140> couple<00:01:30.140> of

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
online I'm not doing another couple of

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.980 
online I'm not doing another couple of
reasons<00:01:30.290> for<00:01:30.560> that<00:01:30.619> one<00:01:31.100> being<00:01:31.460> because<00:01:32.060> I<00:01:32.390> can

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
reasons for that one being because I can

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:42.670 
reasons for that one being because I can
and<00:01:35.680> two<00:01:36.680> being<00:01:38.020> because<00:01:41.140> this<00:01:42.140> one<00:01:42.380> is<00:01:42.649> a

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
and two being because this one is a

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.410 
and two being because this one is a
little<00:01:42.800> different<00:01:43.250> because<00:01:43.550> it<00:01:43.970> actually<00:01:44.119> has

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
little different because it actually has

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.029 
little different because it actually has
the<00:01:44.690> Wireless<00:01:45.080> HD<00:01:46.180> transmitter<00:01:47.320> built<00:01:48.320> inside
