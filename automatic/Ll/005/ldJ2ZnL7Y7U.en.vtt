00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
it for many many years I think I'll

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.890 
it for many many years I think I'll
probably<00:01:08.770> make<00:01:09.010> some<00:01:09.340> sort<00:01:09.520> of<00:01:09.580> a<00:01:09.900> maybe

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
probably make some sort of a maybe

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.840 
probably make some sort of a maybe
stainless<00:01:11.409> steel<00:01:11.650> screen<00:01:12.190> or<00:01:12.490> something<00:01:12.790> like

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
stainless steel screen or something like

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.360 
stainless steel screen or something like
that<00:01:12.940> to<00:01:13.180> go<00:01:13.270> in<00:01:13.360> behind<00:01:13.720> there<00:01:13.990> just<00:01:14.979> to<00:01:15.130> catch

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
that to go in behind there just to catch

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.800 
that to go in behind there just to catch
wherever<00:01:16.120> rocks<00:01:16.450> come<00:01:16.810> my<00:01:16.990> way<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:18.810> since

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
wherever rocks come my way and since

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:20.880 
wherever rocks come my way and since
them<00:01:19.960> in<00:01:20.020> the<00:01:20.080> business<00:01:20.200> I<00:01:20.530> might<00:01:20.740> as<00:01:20.860> well

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
them in the business I might as well

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.390 
them in the business I might as well
tape<00:01:21.250> this<00:01:21.900> light<00:01:22.900> up<00:01:23.080> as<00:01:23.229> well<00:01:23.440> the<00:01:23.710> problem

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
tape this light up as well the problem

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.250 
tape this light up as well the problem
of<00:01:24.460> these<00:01:24.580> things<00:01:24.820> is<00:01:24.940> they're<00:01:25.120> domed<00:01:25.360> and<00:01:25.690> so

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
of these things is they're domed and so

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.550 
of these things is they're domed and so
when<00:01:26.409> you<00:01:26.500> get<00:01:26.620> that<00:01:27.150> they're<00:01:28.150> sort<00:01:28.360> of

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
when you get that they're sort of

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.950 
when you get that they're sort of
rounded<00:01:29.560> I<00:01:29.680> don't<00:01:30.400> know<00:01:30.490> and<00:01:30.760> so<00:01:31.600> when<00:01:31.780> you<00:01:31.869> get

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
rounded I don't know and so when you get

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.680 
rounded I don't know and so when you get
that<00:01:32.170> fancy<00:01:32.950> tape<00:01:33.369> and<00:01:34.030> 3m<00:01:34.659> stuff<00:01:35.250> it's<00:01:36.250> quite
