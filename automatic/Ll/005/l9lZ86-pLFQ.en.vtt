00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.010
 tea 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.920
 This is what we call economics. Rational choice theory. 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.220
 I'm calling. 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.250
 In fact, 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:27.270
 We also criticize this very often in this time of neoliberalism that I always talk about 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:31.349
 The stem has a typical gain the most easily expressed in one won the first choice wood 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:35.070
 For example, 00 I could go to the logic of why not to produce 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:38.910
 I'm approaching from a very micro economic point of view. 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.040
 There is a person who has a lot of people. 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.250
 So now I think that 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.210
 There are four ways we can choose between street lights . 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:53.640
 RockThere..it here itgoyo individuals then he pulled the rest of the individual 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.390
 Let's think first of all, I will pay taxes to write street lights 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.230
 I did it. 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:02.400
 You do not have to pay taxes again . I do not want to use street lights 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.960
 But I paid for it to light the street lights, but other people 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.250
 I paid the money. 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:12.450
 So if you have a streetlight , give me your first kiss. 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.040
 I paid for it, and other people paid for it. 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.880
 The second Casser. 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.080
 I did not pay, but everybody else made money. 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.280
 Resulting'll calm 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.050
 What is the third castle? I paid for it. 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.010
 It is caused by the revolt 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:31.470
 Now what would be the fourth case? I do not have money . 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.740
 I do not have money, so I do not have street lights . 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.430
 Now, what are we all and what are we rational humans ? 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.680
 I'll try to think about it. 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.210
 It's okay. 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:48.240
 It's as good as the second kiss. Why did not I do it today? 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:52.140
 How long does this take'd written a street lamp come 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.810
 But this party matters mwonyamyeon John's the best case, then as a teacher 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:59.190
 Andoejyo private party bonde naeseyo cleansing 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:02.280
 So funny is not only rational, but everyone else. 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:06.180
 It's reasonable . So will not the others pay me or not? 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:11.160
 Give me a guide and then all the members of society will not pay taxes for powder etc. 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:14.970
 So guide me all those two won this time, but the conclusion is what emerges 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:18.870
 Annawaseo only four times streetlights did not happen this chair in economics 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:22.380
 This rational choice theory is a typical rational choice theory, 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:26.190
 Everywhere because the name comes from the settlement. 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:30.480
 So what doeneunya major policy theory is very hardened, so the original 5 days 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:33.150
 What is the logic that friends like W has come out of now is very easy 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.810
 The young person who wants to be a candidate is not elected 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:40.620
 There's not a great big party spots are important young friends 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:43.680
 Now we have Young Friends of the Young People, and it 's the same. 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.280
 There are four ways to make an election. 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:51.390
 What is your first blessing? 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.920
 Now is not inferior Young People Young friends itjyo even our young friends Yes 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.209
 Let's have a newsletter. 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.400
 Let's think about this as a candidate that next time we do not support young people 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.880
 Let 's have a candidate that does not have a b. 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:06.269
 Eojjae example, two 2 minutes and let the struggle Nice performance record 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:11.160
 For example, 1. 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:15.239
 What does this mean? My college tuition is very high. 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.120
 This is the guy I was graduating with. 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.110
 Populism. Someone who is talking to me. 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.430
 see 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.420
 That did exactly the same way there are lovers, for example two minutes of young people 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:30.090
 I support the part. 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:32.880
 Well, I vote, but the other young friends also voted . 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.390
 So there is a case where a is lost. 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:41.180
 What is the second one? I went to play without a vote. 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:45.620
 So you can vote a for your other young friends and win a . 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.330
 What's the third thing? I went to the polls like crazy, 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:52.910
 Friends go for a picnic 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:55.100
 The rain is elected yobeon I have not even vote, vote with your friends 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.410
 When the rain is elected. 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:01.080
 Here you'll either be good or something did 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:06.510
 Needless to say, this is three trillion seconds 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:08.160
 I drove to go outing, I love to go out to the movies to see the new punk 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.580
 What are you looking at? 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:16.380
 I played hard, but movies that she won the vote by the other children 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.730
 It's the best, but you saw it. It's the same. 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.720
 I'm not acting. 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:26.130
 Me and other friends also smart to act more term if I do not vote someone else 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.480
 So the conclusion is that all of this is going to rain out. 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.560
 Your best interest 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:34.890
 There are younger generations, and then there are those who are gathered together. 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:39.720
 But there is no second berry here This is our economy 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:43.110
 It should be noted that the higher the education level, the more 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:47.820
 Did it would be a rational choice adverse selection 2 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:49.830
 I wanted the results this time, but the reverse selection with 4 results is more advanced 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:53.130
 Young and Bright 1 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:57.150
 Expressing it easily means that it's good to have them sung in the West. 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:05:02.190
 Those young friends have voted and closed , and those who are loyal have a high turnout 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:06.660
 Do not you think that the 2 supportive candidates of the aged all the time are elected 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.740
 Why did a high probability that even a rational choice because it not such a good choice 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.280
 I will not. 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:16.350
 So, you guys, we have today - Yoko, but I'm not Tom. 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:21.840
 It's easy , but what's this? What's this? 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:25.770
 What do you mean you know what, so we folded our tails requirement election election 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:30.120
 I am the same as anyone who is my nation, so we are all together April 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:34.919
 In order to prevent such a reverse election for the 11th day of voting in April, 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:40.100
 We looked at these economic members of the economy, 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:40.100
 Let's go to the polls together.
