said<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.439> thought<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.680> was<00:01:28.770> excellent<00:01:28.920> at

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
said I thought it was excellent at

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.190 
said I thought it was excellent at
Anfield<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.180> only<00:01:30.329> played<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.540> think<00:01:30.689> 60

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
Anfield the only played I think 60

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.520 
Anfield the only played I think 60
minutes<00:01:31.470> 60<00:01:31.740> 70<00:01:32.100> minutes<00:01:32.479> so<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.290> the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
minutes 60 70 minutes so the the the

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.429 
minutes 60 70 minutes so the the the
plan<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:34.860> for<00:01:34.890> him<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.280> try<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.610> play<00:01:35.729> 90

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
plan is for him to try and play 90

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.870 
plan is for him to try and play 90
against<00:01:37.439> Bolton<00:01:37.829> at<00:01:37.950> Carrow<00:01:38.159> Road<00:01:38.280> and

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
against Bolton at Carrow Road and

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.160 
against Bolton at Carrow Road and
obviously<00:01:39.119> if<00:01:39.210> he<00:01:39.270> comes<00:01:39.450> through<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.930> then

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
obviously if he comes through that then

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.870 
obviously if he comes through that then
again<00:01:40.710> another<00:01:40.890> really<00:01:41.189> valuable<00:01:41.520> member<00:01:41.850> of

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
again another really valuable member of

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.889 
again another really valuable member of
the<00:01:41.970> squad<00:01:42.240> would<00:01:42.329> be<00:01:42.450> great<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.750> have<00:01:42.840> him

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
the squad would be great to have him

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.560 
the squad would be great to have him
back<00:01:43.189> moving<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.250> focus<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:45.180> follow<00:01:45.360> Neal

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
back moving the focus to follow Neal

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.719 
back moving the focus to follow Neal

them and of course they're at home but
obviously<00:02:07.530> with<00:02:07.829> what's<00:02:08.069> happened<00:02:08.399> here<00:02:08.489> this

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
obviously with what's happened here this

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.550 
obviously with what's happened here this
week<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.209> know<00:02:09.390> hopefully<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:10.050> gives<00:02:10.229> us<00:02:10.440> a

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
week you know hopefully that gives us a

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.160 
week you know hopefully that gives us a
fresh<00:02:10.800> impetus<00:02:11.099> and

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
fresh impetus and

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.140 
fresh impetus and
as<00:02:12.560> I<00:02:12.709> say<00:02:12.890> if<00:02:12.980> anything<00:02:13.310> to<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.640> training<00:02:14.060> is

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
as I say if anything to the training is

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.880 
as I say if anything to the training is
to<00:02:14.300> go<00:02:14.420> by<00:02:14.660> then<00:02:14.930> we<00:02:15.260> certainly<00:02:15.560> going<00:02:15.709> down

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
to go by then we certainly going down

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.229 
to go by then we certainly going down
there<00:02:16.099> with<00:02:16.220> confidence<00:02:16.700> so<00:02:16.819> you've<00:02:16.940> got<00:02:16.970> two

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
there with confidence so you've got two

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.570 
there with confidence so you've got two
teams<00:02:17.480> who<00:02:17.720> should<00:02:17.930> be<00:02:18.050> right<00:02:18.230> at<00:02:18.260> it<00:02:18.620> we've

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
teams who should be right at it we've

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.800 
teams who should be right at it we've
obviously<00:02:19.700> had<00:02:19.910> three<00:02:20.209> games<00:02:20.390> already<00:02:20.630> the

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
obviously had three games already the

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.809 
obviously had three games already the
season<00:02:21.050> against<00:02:21.319> Fulham<00:02:21.590> no<00:02:22.099> wins<00:02:22.340> thus<00:02:22.580> far

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
season against Fulham no wins thus far

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:23.890 
season against Fulham no wins thus far
as<00:02:23.030> there<00:02:23.239> is<00:02:23.330> something<00:02:23.540> you<00:02:23.630> could<00:02:23.690> put<00:02:23.840> your

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
as there is something you could put your

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.150 
as there is something you could put your
finger<00:02:24.140> on<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.319> say<00:02:24.470> this<00:02:24.590> is<00:02:24.739> what<00:02:24.860> we<00:02:24.920> can<00:02:25.040> do

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
finger on to say this is what we can do

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.710 
finger on to say this is what we can do
to<00:02:25.250> change<00:02:25.400> things<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:25.819> maybe<00:02:25.940> give<00:02:26.420> it<00:02:26.540> give

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
to change things and maybe give it give

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.780 
to change things and maybe give it give
them<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:26.930> bit<00:02:27.110> more<00:02:27.200> of<00:02:27.260> a<00:02:27.349> game<00:02:27.500> I<00:02:27.790> think

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
them a bit more of a game I think

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.760 
them a bit more of a game I think
confidence<00:02:29.000> is<00:02:29.330> a<00:02:29.390> big<00:02:29.600> thing<00:02:29.810> certainly<00:02:30.650> when

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
confidence is a big thing certainly when

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.260 
confidence is a big thing certainly when
you<00:02:30.890> when<00:02:31.010> you've<00:02:31.160> you're<00:02:31.819> racking<00:02:32.180> up

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
you when you've you're racking up

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.570 
you when you've you're racking up
defeats<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:33.080> you<00:02:33.440> know<00:02:33.560> it<00:02:33.800> can<00:02:34.040> become<00:02:34.160> a<00:02:34.340> bit

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
defeats and you know it can become a bit

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.000 
defeats and you know it can become a bit
of<00:02:34.610> a<00:02:34.730> stigma<00:02:34.940> really<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.680> whether<00:02:36.680> you<00:02:36.830> go

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
of a stigma really and whether you go

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.920 
of a stigma really and whether you go
into<00:02:37.250> games<00:02:37.459> almost<00:02:37.670> expecting<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.630> worst<00:02:38.780> I

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
into games almost expecting the worst I

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.180 
into games almost expecting the worst I
don't<00:02:39.140> know<00:02:39.290> that's<00:02:39.500> been<00:02:39.739> one<00:02:39.860> of<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.010> key

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
don't know that's been one of the key

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.220 
don't know that's been one of the key
messages<00:02:40.610> here<00:02:40.819> now<00:02:41.060> that<00:02:41.120> changes<00:02:41.720> now<00:02:41.900> we<00:02:41.959> go

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
messages here now that changes now we go

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.800 
messages here now that changes now we go
there<00:02:42.470> too<00:02:42.709> we<00:02:43.430> try<00:02:43.610> to<00:02:43.670> win<00:02:43.910> every<00:02:44.180> game<00:02:44.209> and

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
there too we try to win every game and

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.690 
there too we try to win every game and
we<00:02:45.380> know<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.620> games<00:02:45.800> that<00:02:45.890> we're<00:02:46.100> facing<00:02:46.220> but

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
we know the games that we're facing but

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.370 
we know the games that we're facing but
I<00:02:47.209> don't<00:02:47.480> think<00:02:47.540> you<00:02:47.660> can<00:02:47.780> go<00:02:47.930> into<00:02:48.080> anything

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
I don't think you can go into anything

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.930 
I don't think you can go into anything
other<00:02:48.650> than<00:02:48.769> with<00:02:48.980> confidence<00:02:49.489> and<00:02:49.610> trying<00:02:49.880> to

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
other than with confidence and trying to

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.580 
other than with confidence and trying to
go<00:02:50.060> and<00:02:50.180> give<00:02:50.299> it<00:02:50.330> everything<00:02:50.630> you've<00:02:50.900> got<00:02:50.930> so
