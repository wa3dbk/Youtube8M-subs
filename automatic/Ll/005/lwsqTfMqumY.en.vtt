reason<00:02:07.479> is<00:02:07.810> to<00:02:07.869> really<00:02:08.259> allow<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:08.470> cocktail

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
reason is to really allow the cocktail

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.220 
reason is to really allow the cocktail
ingredients<00:02:09.580> to<00:02:09.729> mix<00:02:10.000> and<00:02:10.270> really<00:02:10.690> get<00:02:11.110> to

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
ingredients to mix and really get to

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.650 
ingredients to mix and really get to
know<00:02:11.260> each<00:02:11.410> other<00:02:11.740> in<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:11.950> shaker<00:02:12.190> so<00:02:13.030> as<00:02:13.390> much

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
know each other in the shaker so as much

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.510 
know each other in the shaker so as much
ice<00:02:13.870> as<00:02:13.900> possible<00:02:14.560> means<00:02:14.800> that<00:02:14.950> we<00:02:15.040> can<00:02:15.190> really

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
ice as possible means that we can really

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.170 
ice as possible means that we can really
chill<00:02:15.820> down

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
chill down

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.929 
chill down

wedge<00:03:37.750> for<00:03:37.989> your<00:03:38.109> daiquiri<00:03:38.530> is<00:03:38.799> perhaps<00:03:39.729> your

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
wedge for your daiquiri is perhaps your

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.909 
wedge for your daiquiri is perhaps your
guests<00:03:40.329> on<00:03:40.629> the<00:03:40.720> first<00:03:41.019> step<00:03:41.260> think<00:03:41.560> that<00:03:41.799> it's

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:41.919 
guests on the first step think that it's

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:44.580 
guests on the first step think that it's
not<00:03:42.489> quite<00:03:42.699> tart<00:03:42.970> enough<00:03:43.299> can<00:03:43.989> simply<00:03:44.379> take

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
not quite tart enough can simply take

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.099 
not quite tart enough can simply take
the<00:03:44.769> wedge<00:03:44.949> squeeze<00:03:45.849> in<00:03:46.030> little<00:03:46.509> extra<00:03:46.840> fresh

the wedge squeeze in little extra fresh
lime<00:03:47.439> juice<00:03:47.639> so<00:03:48.639> that's<00:03:49.090> the<00:03:49.329> daiquiri<00:03:50.169> an

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:50.439 
lime juice so that's the daiquiri an

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:54.120 
lime juice so that's the daiquiri an
example<00:03:51.009> of<00:03:51.099> a<00:03:51.189> shaken<00:03:51.669> cocktail
