00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:07.009
 As you can see here, the error marks us 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.009
 of 13 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:12.320
 there you can see it 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.150
 13 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:19.450
 then the solution to this problem 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:22.880
 to do is press the rc stop button 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:27.110
 for a little more than five seconds 167 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:30.410
 enough seconds and then she 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.810
 begins to work this error is due 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.390
 to what 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.370
 the cartridge does not recognize the ink that 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.739
 it remains in him or rather the printer 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.190
 does not recognize the ink that remains in the 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.190
 cartridge 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.969
 then with this operation what 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:54.110
 we do is enable what we have said 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:56.180
 no longer have that order 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.620
 he passes right and we follow 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.620
 printing normally 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.440
 here as we see is doing the job 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.310
 of the respective order that we gave 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:22.799
 we wait a moment 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.799
 until the number 1 appears 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.509
 ah 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.960
 and this says that the list is ready 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:50.140
 the cartridge now let's proceed to 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.800
 print a copy to be a citizen of 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.800
 either 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.280
 here as you can see the impression there 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.650
 it was good because this cartridge has 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.520
 a problem in the head prints everything 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.320
 scratched and next to the head was made 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.320
 cleaning by means of software and 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.370
 cartridge does not work we install you another 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.580
 cartridge 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.330
 that we have also with just a little bit 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.330
 from ink 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:39.160
 here we make the same mistake again 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.540
 so I tell them the cartridge is very 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.420
 short of ink 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.620
 and the printer can not identify what 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.489
 so much ink law then 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.489
 we do the same procedure 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.420
 press for 56 seconds the button 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.420
 reset 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.420
 and the printer makes another the order that 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.420
 you gave him 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.110
 We wait for you to dial the number 1 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.110
 in the panel 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.520
 and this now we proceed to take out the copy 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.310
 and the copy is in perfect condition because 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.550
 this the head of this cartridge is 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.550
 all right 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:05.060
 then it 's all friend is the solution
