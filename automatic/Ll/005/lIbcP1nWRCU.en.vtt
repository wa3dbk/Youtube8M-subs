high little joke so first off I need to
make<00:00:06.450> a<00:00:06.810> prediction<00:00:08.389> so<00:00:09.389> let's<00:00:09.620> choose<00:00:13.940> to

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
make a prediction so let's choose to

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.290 
make a prediction so let's choose to
Punk<00:00:15.150> out<00:00:15.330> there<00:00:16.430> so<00:00:19.580> now<00:00:20.580> I'm<00:00:20.699> turn<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:21.000> over

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
Punk out there so now I'm turn it over

there isn't a spectator here I'll flip

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.230 
there isn't a spectator here I'll flip
stuff<00:00:27.000> for<00:00:27.240> ya<00:00:27.390> so<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:28.019> say<00:00:28.519> stop<00:00:29.519> there<00:00:29.820> too

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.540 
stuff for ya so you say stop there too
much<00:00:30.539> power<00:00:30.840> over<00:00:33.770> and<00:00:34.770> I'll<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.040> power<00:00:35.250> level

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
much power over and I'll a power level

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.880 
much power over and I'll a power level
as<00:00:35.670> up<00:00:37.370> right<00:00:38.370> now<00:00:39.270> I'll<00:00:39.660> get<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:40.020> spectator

as up right now I'll get you spectator
2.2<00:00:41.760> eve<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:41.969> these<00:00:42.329> two<00:00:42.540> paths<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.739> that's<00:00:43.860> a

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
2.2 eve of these two paths so that's a

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.389 
2.2 eve of these two paths so that's a
point<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.370> one<00:00:44.550> here<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.600> top<00:00:45.809> card

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
point to this one here so that top card

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.270 
point to this one here so that top card
just<00:00:47.399> think<00:00:47.899> that<00:00:48.899> means<00:00:49.140> need<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.070> count

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
just think that means need to count

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.889 
just think that means need to count
eight<00:00:50.520> from<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:51.000> pal<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:52.489> know<00:00:53.489> one<00:00:53.969> two<00:00:54.570> three

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
eight from this pal I know one two three

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.840 
eight from this pal I know one two three
four<00:00:55.590> five<00:00:55.829> six<00:00:56.640> seven<00:00:57.180> eight<00:00:58.250> and<00:00:59.250> download

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
four five six seven eight and download

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.779 
four five six seven eight and download
now<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:01.050> would<00:01:01.170> miss<00:01:01.320> stop<00:01:01.649> get<00:01:02.370> anywhere<00:01:02.730> in

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
now you would miss stop get anywhere in

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.690 
now you would miss stop get anywhere in
the<00:01:02.879> deck<00:01:03.619> and<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.769> stopped<00:01:05.540> at<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.720> 38<00:01:07.700> and

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
the deck and you stopped at the 38 and

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.660 
the deck and you stopped at the 38 and
that<00:01:08.880> prediction<00:01:09.590> was<00:01:11.299> the<00:01:12.299> ring<00:01:13.460> after<00:01:14.460> a

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
that prediction was the ring after a

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.050 
that prediction was the ring after a
simple<00:01:15.119> trick<00:01:15.330> I'll<00:01:15.509> explain<00:01:15.840> how<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.080> do<00:01:16.259> it

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
simple trick I'll explain how you do it

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.010 
simple trick I'll explain how you do it
first<00:01:18.060> off<00:01:18.299> just<00:01:18.450> take<00:01:18.720> out<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.200> 40<00:01:20.840> but<00:01:21.840> one

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
first off just take out the 40 but one

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.859 
first off just take out the 40 but one
on<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.200> top<00:01:23.000> and<00:01:24.000> go<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.360> bottom<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.659> a
