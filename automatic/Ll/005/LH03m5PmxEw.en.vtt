00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
all the same

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.910 
all the same
remember<00:03:05.269> they<00:03:05.420> they<00:03:05.630> first<00:03:05.930> came<00:03:06.500> out<00:03:06.709> in

2005 or 2015 and what it was what was so

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:11.949 
2005 or 2015 and what it was what was so
revolutionary<00:03:10.790> about<00:03:11.299> them<00:03:11.600> even<00:03:11.720> though<00:03:11.930> a

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
revolutionary about them even though a

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.449 
revolutionary about them even though a
lot<00:03:12.019> of<00:03:12.140> trainers<00:03:12.410> are<00:03:12.590> using<00:03:12.920> it<00:03:13.010> now<00:03:13.239> is<00:03:14.239> this

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
lot of trainers are using it now is this

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.210 
lot of trainers are using it now is this
computerized<00:03:16.459> up<00:03:17.530> computerized<00:03:18.530> material<00:03:19.070> up

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
computerized up computerized material up

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.890 
computerized up computerized material up
or<00:03:19.400> whatever<00:03:20.299> that<00:03:20.450> means

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
or whatever that means

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.660 
or whatever that means
I<00:03:20.930> don't<00:03:21.230> know<00:03:21.380> I'm<00:03:21.500> my<00:03:21.860> expert<00:03:22.310> and<00:03:22.519> don't

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
I don't know I'm my expert and don't

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.060 
I don't know I'm my expert and don't
work<00:03:22.850> for<00:03:23.060> night<00:03:23.269> I<00:03:23.480> just<00:03:23.989> think<00:03:24.350> it's<00:03:24.470> kind<00:03:24.980> of

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
work for night I just think it's kind of

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.160 
work for night I just think it's kind of
like<00:03:25.250> a<00:03:25.280> nylon<00:03:25.850> ish<00:03:26.090> across<00:03:26.480> between<00:03:26.630> nylon

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
like a nylon ish across between nylon

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.110 
like a nylon ish across between nylon
and<00:03:27.320> some<00:03:27.440> other<00:03:27.620> materials<00:03:28.220> very<00:03:28.820> breathable

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
and some other materials very breathable

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.310 
and some other materials very breathable
very<00:03:29.570> very<00:03:30.170> very<00:03:30.470> light<00:03:30.830> these<00:03:31.070> trainers<00:03:31.340> are

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
very very very light these trainers are

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.770 
very very very light these trainers are
at<00:03:33.320> the<00:03:33.500> back<00:03:34.030> that<00:03:35.030> is<00:03:35.180> supposed<00:03:35.510> to<00:03:35.600> be<00:03:35.750> a

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
at the back that is supposed to be a

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.220 
at the back that is supposed to be a
nice<00:03:36.049> sign<00:03:37.030> in<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:38.239> back<00:03:38.450> but<00:03:38.900> it<00:03:39.080> just

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
nice sign in the back but it just

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.320 
nice sign in the back but it just
doesn't<00:03:39.530> look<00:03:39.560> right<00:03:39.680> you<00:03:40.100> see<00:03:40.549> it<00:03:40.610> maybe<00:03:41.180> it's

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
doesn't look right you see it maybe it's

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:49.300 
doesn't look right you see it maybe it's
got<00:03:41.450> a<00:03:41.480> plastic<00:03:41.720> thing<00:03:42.080> over<00:03:46.239> anyway<00:03:47.269> um<00:03:48.310> then

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
got a plastic thing over anyway um then

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.550 
got a plastic thing over anyway um then
you<00:03:49.370> look<00:03:49.489> at<00:03:49.580> the<00:03:49.640> sole<00:03:49.940> like<00:03:50.870> ultimately<00:03:51.470> I

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
you look at the sole like ultimately I

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.110 
you look at the sole like ultimately I
think<00:03:51.769> these<00:03:51.860> are<00:03:51.980> just<00:03:52.040> for<00:03:52.340> that<00:03:52.459> these<00:03:52.940> are

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
think these are just for that these are

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.890 
think these are just for that these are
your<00:03:53.360> ultimate<00:03:53.540> walking<00:03:54.350> trainers

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.530 

I<00:03:58.099> can't<00:03:59.099> see<00:03:59.250> doing<00:03:59.519> much<00:03:59.640> else<00:03:59.819> in<00:04:00.000> them<00:04:00.150> or

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
I can't see doing much else in them or

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.910 
I can't see doing much else in them or
maybe<00:04:00.750> even<00:04:00.840> football<00:04:01.409> you<00:04:01.530> could<00:04:01.680> have<00:04:01.890> a

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
maybe even football you could have a

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.229 
maybe even football you could have a
little<00:04:02.159> kick<00:04:02.310> about<00:04:02.430> or<00:04:02.700> a<00:04:02.730> little<00:04:02.940> training

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
little kick about or a little training

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.670 
little kick about or a little training
session<00:04:03.510> in<00:04:03.599> these<00:04:03.780> and<00:04:03.989> because<00:04:04.470> obviously

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
session in these and because obviously

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.160 
session in these and because obviously
the<00:04:04.920> soul<00:04:05.159> is<00:04:05.280> very<00:04:05.489> flexible<00:04:05.870> and<00:04:06.870> then

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
the soul is very flexible and then

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.690 
the soul is very flexible and then
you've<00:04:07.290> got<00:04:07.470> I<00:04:07.680> think<00:04:07.860> they<00:04:08.190> call<00:04:08.430> it<00:04:08.459> a

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
you've got I think they call it a

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.890 
you've got I think they call it a
geometric<00:04:09.450> soul<00:04:11.330> maybe<00:04:12.330> because<00:04:12.540> clothes<00:04:12.720> got

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
geometric soul maybe because clothes got

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.750 
geometric soul maybe because clothes got
that<00:04:13.049> flows<00:04:13.290> kind<00:04:13.769> of<00:04:13.860> happens<00:04:14.280> there<00:04:14.579> and

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
that flows kind of happens there and

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.900 
that flows kind of happens there and
whatnot<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:18.060> red<00:04:18.299> kind<00:04:18.959> of<00:04:19.079> wacky<00:04:19.260> still<00:04:19.910> can

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
whatnot the red kind of wacky still can

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.270 
whatnot the red kind of wacky still can
you<00:04:21.060> wear<00:04:21.239> these<00:04:21.419> with<00:04:21.690> trousers<00:04:22.229> I'm<00:04:22.860> not

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
you wear these with trousers I'm not
