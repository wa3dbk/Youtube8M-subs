00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.200 

the<00:00:12.420> as3x<00:00:13.049> system<00:00:13.590> has<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.219> unique<00:00:14.670> option<00:00:14.879> and

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
the as3x system has a unique option and

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.030 
the as3x system has a unique option and
then<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:15.570> allows<00:00:15.780> you<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.080> set<00:00:16.290> two<00:00:16.590> types<00:00:16.890> of

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:17.040 
then it allows you to set two types of

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.490 
then it allows you to set two types of
failsafe<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.900> either<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:19.110> these<00:00:19.200> types<00:00:19.410> of

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
failsafe and either of these types of

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.100 
failsafe and either of these types of
failsafe<00:00:19.680> can<00:00:20.220> be<00:00:20.340> set<00:00:20.550> for<00:00:20.700> any<00:00:20.910> channel<00:00:21.570> so

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.110 
failsafe can be set for any channel so

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.530 
failsafe can be set for any channel so
you<00:00:22.170> have<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.680> preset<00:00:23.250> failsafe<00:00:23.520> and<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.390> have

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:24.540 
you have a preset failsafe and you have

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.560 
you have a preset failsafe and you have
a<00:00:24.570> hold<00:00:24.900> fail-safe<00:00:25.550> preset<00:00:26.550> failsafe<00:00:26.820> means

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
a hold fail-safe preset failsafe means

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.019 
a hold fail-safe preset failsafe means
that<00:00:27.750> if<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.080> have<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.289> loss<00:00:28.770> of<00:00:29.010> signal<00:00:29.189> that

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
that if you have a loss of signal that

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.780 
that if you have a loss of signal that
that<00:00:30.270> control<00:00:30.660> surface<00:00:31.080> will<00:00:31.800> be<00:00:31.980> driven<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.760> a

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
that control surface will be driven to a

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.750 
that control surface will be driven to a
preset<00:00:33.360> failsafe<00:00:33.660> position<00:00:34.489> hold<00:00:35.489> blast

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
preset failsafe position hold blast

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.060 
preset failsafe position hold blast
position<00:00:36.300> means<00:00:37.080> that<00:00:37.290> if<00:00:37.379> you<00:00:37.530> have<00:00:37.680> loss<00:00:37.890> of

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
position means that if you have loss of

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.880 
position means that if you have loss of
signal<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:39.059> surface<00:00:39.600> will<00:00:39.960> maintain<00:00:40.260> the

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
signal that surface will maintain the

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.250 
signal that surface will maintain the
last-known<00:00:41.460> position<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:42.690> course<00:00:42.899> when<00:00:43.140> the

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
last-known position of course when the

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260 
last-known position of course when the
signal<00:00:43.649> recovers<00:00:44.160> you'll<00:00:44.460> immediately<00:00:44.700> gain

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
signal recovers you'll immediately gain

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.389 
signal recovers you'll immediately gain
control<00:00:45.719> but<00:00:46.410> those<00:00:46.590> are<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.770> two<00:00:47.010> types<00:00:47.250> of

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
control but those are the two types of

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.130 
control but those are the two types of
fail<00:00:47.610> safes<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.000> are<00:00:48.149> available<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.780> as<00:00:49.110> I

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
fail safes that are available and as I

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.350 
fail safes that are available and as I
mentioned<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.739> screen<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.190> we<00:00:50.280> have

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
mentioned the screen that we have

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.150 
mentioned the screen that we have
available<00:00:51.360> here<00:00:51.420> shows<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.710> can<00:00:52.890> set

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
available here shows that you can set

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.000 
available here shows that you can set
either<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.610> preset<00:00:54.059> or<00:00:54.270> hold<00:00:54.719> for<00:00:55.140> any<00:00:55.320> or<00:00:55.710> all

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
either the preset or hold for any or all

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.040 
either the preset or hold for any or all
of<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.430> channels<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:56.940> in<00:00:57.210> fact<00:00:57.450> you<00:00:57.690> can<00:00:57.840> mix

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
of the channels and in fact you can mix

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.529 
of the channels and in fact you can mix
them<00:00:58.140> up<00:00:58.289> for<00:00:59.070> an<00:00:59.190> airplane<00:00:59.489> like<00:00:59.789> like<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
them up for an airplane like like the

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.500 
them up for an airplane like like the
yak<00:01:00.750> it's<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.649> very<00:01:01.770> common<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.579> have<00:01:03.030> preset

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
yak it's it's very common to have preset

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.690 
yak it's it's very common to have preset
failsafe<00:01:03.780> on<00:01:04.289> throttle<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.190> fact<00:01:05.460> we

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
failsafe on throttle and in fact we

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.219 
failsafe on throttle and in fact we
would<00:01:05.850> highly<00:01:06.210> recommend<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.720> on<00:01:06.810> throttle

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
would highly recommend it on throttle

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.440 
would highly recommend it on throttle
because<00:01:07.590> if<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.100> lose<00:01:08.430> signal<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.090> want<00:01:09.240> the

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
because if you lose signal you want the

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.050 
because if you lose signal you want the
airplane<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.960> throttle<00:01:10.289> back<00:01:10.580> all<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.850> other

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
airplane to throttle back all the other

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.730 
airplane to throttle back all the other
channels<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.750> pretty<00:01:12.990> typical<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.590> have<00:01:13.710> a

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
channels is pretty typical to have a

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.770 
channels is pretty typical to have a
hold<00:01:14.010> last<00:01:14.280> command<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:14.909> way<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.450> airplane

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
hold last command that way the airplane

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.600 
hold last command that way the airplane
continues<00:01:16.260> doing<00:01:16.470> what<00:01:16.830> it's<00:01:17.010> what<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.520> was

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
continues doing what it's what it was

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.250 
continues doing what it's what it was
previously<00:01:17.820> doing<00:01:18.210> if<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.930> were<00:01:19.049> going<00:01:19.170> to

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
previously doing if you were going to

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.530 
previously doing if you were going to
set<00:01:19.470> this<00:01:19.619> up<00:01:19.799> on<00:01:20.010> a<00:01:20.040> sail<00:01:20.340> plane<00:01:20.580> however<00:01:20.820> it's

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
set this up on a sail plane however it's

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.690 
set this up on a sail plane however it's
a<00:01:21.689> real<00:01:21.930> good<00:01:22.140> idea<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.770> have<00:01:22.950> preset<00:01:23.490> failsafe

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
a real good idea to have preset failsafe

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.370 
a real good idea to have preset failsafe
for<00:01:24.180> example<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.810> rudder<00:01:24.990> on<00:01:25.140> the

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
for example on the rudder on the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.940 
for example on the rudder on the
elevator

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
elevator

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.310 
elevator
imagine<00:01:26.490> your<00:01:26.610> thermal<00:01:26.970> really<00:01:27.420> high<00:01:27.600> you

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
imagine your thermal really high you

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.950 
imagine your thermal really high you
have<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.860> loss<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.640> signal<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.600> airplane

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
have a loss of signal and the airplane

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.050 
have a loss of signal and the airplane
just<00:01:30.990> continues<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.740> go<00:01:32.100> in<00:01:32.250> at<00:01:32.369> same<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.970> know

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
just continues to go in at same you know

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.640 
just continues to go in at same you know
direction<00:01:33.540> it'll<00:01:33.780> end<00:01:33.930> up<00:01:34.020> flying<00:01:34.290> away

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
direction it'll end up flying away

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.100 
direction it'll end up flying away
so<00:01:34.890> with<00:01:35.070> sailplanes<00:01:35.520> you'll<00:01:36.180> want<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.420> have<00:01:37.080> a

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
so with sailplanes you'll want to have a

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.499 
so with sailplanes you'll want to have a
preset<00:01:37.590> on<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.220> elevator<00:01:38.670> rudder<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.420> that

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
preset on the elevator rudder so that

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.080 
preset on the elevator rudder so that
the<00:01:39.600> airplane<00:01:39.930> will<00:01:40.079> descend<00:01:40.439> come<00:01:40.680> down

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
the airplane will descend come down

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.330 
the airplane will descend come down
aerobatic<00:01:42.090> airplanes<00:01:42.479> like<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:43.020> or<00:01:43.320> any<00:01:43.950> gas

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
aerobatic airplanes like this or any gas

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.429 
aerobatic airplanes like this or any gas
or<00:01:44.520> glow<00:01:44.729> powered<00:01:45.060> airplane<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.720> always<00:01:46.200> want

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
or glow powered airplane you always want

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.530 
or glow powered airplane you always want
to<00:01:46.500> have<00:01:46.650> preset<00:01:47.100> on<00:01:47.310> throttle<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.360> want

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
to have preset on throttle and you want

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.679 
to have preset on throttle and you want
to<00:01:48.659> set<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.290> low<00:01:49.470> throttle<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.040> other<00:01:51.000> the

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
to set it to low throttle and other the

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.780 
to set it to low throttle and other the
other<00:01:51.990> surfaces<00:01:52.560> generally<00:01:53.250> you'll<00:01:53.520> have<00:01:53.670> it

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
other surfaces generally you'll have it

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.030 
other surfaces generally you'll have it
set<00:01:53.939> up<00:01:53.970> on<00:01:54.240> hold<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:55.140> also<00:01:55.409> allows<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:55.979> to

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
set up on hold this also allows you to

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.730 
set up on hold this also allows you to
set<00:01:56.310> up<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.700> gear<00:01:56.939> channel<00:01:57.329> so<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:58.649> know

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
set up the gear channel so you know

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.020 
set up the gear channel so you know
wherever<00:01:58.950> you're<00:01:59.310> going<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.490> have<00:01:59.640> your<00:01:59.820> gear

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
wherever you're going to have your gear

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.100 
wherever you're going to have your gear
plugged<00:02:00.270> in<00:02:00.420> if<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.659> have<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.780> retractable

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
plugged in if you have a retractable

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.620 
plugged in if you have a retractable
gear<00:02:01.590> some<00:02:02.430> guys<00:02:02.610> like<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.880> have<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.270> gear<00:02:03.479> go

gear some guys like to have the gear go

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.469 
gear some guys like to have the gear go
down<00:02:03.960> automatically<00:02:04.920> that's<00:02:05.820> an<00:02:06.090> indicator

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
down automatically that's an indicator

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.259 
down automatically that's an indicator
that<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.869> have<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.409> loss<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.799> signal<00:02:08.090> but<00:02:09.090> the

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
that you have a loss of signal but the

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.660 
that you have a loss of signal but the
choice<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.690> yours<00:02:09.720> now<00:02:10.590> in<00:02:10.799> order<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.370> store

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
choice is yours now in order to store

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.090 
choice is yours now in order to store
those<00:02:12.030> preset<00:02:12.570> failsafe<00:02:12.900> positions<00:02:13.799> that

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
those preset failsafe positions that

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.800 
those preset failsafe positions that
occurs<00:02:14.459> just<00:02:14.760> like<00:02:14.970> with<00:02:15.150> any<00:02:15.360> spectrum

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
occurs just like with any spectrum

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.780 
occurs just like with any spectrum
system<00:02:16.260> that<00:02:16.709> occurs<00:02:16.980> during<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.580> buying

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
system that occurs during the buying

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.030 
system that occurs during the buying
process<00:02:18.060> so<00:02:19.050> now<00:02:19.260> we're<00:02:19.560> going<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.709> go<00:02:19.920> ahead

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
process so now we're going to go ahead

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.990 
process so now we're going to go ahead
and<00:02:20.310> bind<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.940> system

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
and bind the system

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.790 
and bind the system
like<00:02:22.270> you<00:02:22.420> normally<00:02:22.660> would<00:02:23.050> with<00:02:23.650> the

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
like you normally would with the

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.470 
like you normally would with the
intention<00:02:24.220> of<00:02:24.280> using<00:02:24.430> preset<00:02:24.820> on<00:02:25.210> throttle

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
intention of using preset on throttle

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.840 
intention of using preset on throttle
only<00:02:25.960> so<00:02:26.440> as<00:02:26.740> I<00:02:27.160> mentioned<00:02:27.520> in<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:27.670> previous

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
only so as I mentioned in the previous

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.120 
only so as I mentioned in the previous
video<00:02:28.150> I<00:02:28.540> actually<00:02:28.900> have<00:02:29.230> an<00:02:29.350> extension<00:02:29.860> this

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
video I actually have an extension this

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.830 
video I actually have an extension this
extension<00:02:30.580> exits<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.480> front<00:02:31.690> of<00:02:31.780> the

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
extension exits the front of the

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.330 
extension exits the front of the
airplane<00:02:31.990> so<00:02:32.320> it's<00:02:32.470> very<00:02:32.620> easy<00:02:32.920> but<00:02:33.190> this

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
airplane so it's very easy but this

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.130 
airplane so it's very easy but this
actually<00:02:33.730> plugs<00:02:33.970> into<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.300> bind<00:02:34.540> programming

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
actually plugs into the bind programming

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.600 
actually plugs into the bind programming
port<00:02:35.350> I'm<00:02:35.770> going<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.040> go<00:02:36.130> ahead<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:36.460> put<00:02:36.580> a

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
port I'm going to go ahead and put a

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.390

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
to go so you'll see here that everything

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.699 
to go so you'll see here that everything
is<00:03:31.690> now<00:03:31.900> working<00:03:33.900> driving<00:03:34.900> the<00:03:35.170> throttle<00:03:35.590> and

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
is now working driving the throttle and

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.740 
is now working driving the throttle and
I've<00:03:36.489> just<00:03:36.760> bound<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.120> system<00:03:37.510> now<00:03:38.410> the

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
I've just bound the system now the

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.600 
I've just bound the system now the
everything<00:03:40.750> was<00:03:40.930> set<00:03:41.140> to<00:03:41.290> hold<00:03:41.530> so<00:03:42.100> let<00:03:42.519> me

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
everything was set to hold so let me

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.520 
everything was set to hold so let me
show<00:03:42.790> you<00:03:42.820> how<00:03:43.060> this<00:03:43.269> works<00:03:43.570> if<00:03:43.810> I<00:03:44.290> have<00:03:44.500> a

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
show you how this works if I have a

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.280 
show you how this works if I have a
little<00:03:44.830> bit<00:03:44.950> of<00:03:45.040> throttle<00:03:45.220> in<00:03:45.519> here<00:03:45.760> and<00:03:46.360> if<00:03:47.140> I

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
little bit of throttle in here and if I

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.199 
little bit of throttle in here and if I
have<00:03:47.320> some<00:03:47.440> ailerons<00:03:47.950> an<00:03:48.100> elevator<00:03:48.549> and<00:03:48.760> if<00:03:49.120> I

see the exclamation mark what that means

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.439 
see the exclamation mark what that means
is<00:05:10.800> it<00:05:10.919> hasn't<00:05:11.099> been<00:05:11.400> written<00:05:11.610> to<00:05:11.759> flash<00:05:12.150> yet
