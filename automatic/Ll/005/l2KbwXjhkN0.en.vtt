into<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.300> wall<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.690> you'll<00:00:57.809> be<00:00:57.899> good<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.109> go

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
into the wall and you'll be good to go

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.790 
into the wall and you'll be good to go
we<00:01:00.270> get<00:01:00.390> multiple<00:01:00.899> options<00:01:01.320> right<00:01:01.469> here<00:01:01.500> these

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
we get multiple options right here these

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.990 
we get multiple options right here these
are<00:01:01.859> just<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.280> case<00:01:02.460> if<00:01:02.670> your<00:01:02.820> little

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
are just in case if your little

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.759 
are just in case if your little
propellers<00:01:03.510> break<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.870> haven't<00:01:04.290> had<00:01:04.409> any

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
propellers break I haven't had any

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.000 
propellers break I haven't had any
problems<00:01:05.220> with<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:05.790> that's<00:01:06.180> good<00:01:06.479> a

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
problems with that so that's good a

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.620 
problems with that so that's good a
little<00:01:08.010> screwdriver<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.880> open<00:01:08.909> up<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.450> back

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
little screwdriver to open up the back

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.149 
little screwdriver to open up the back
of<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.840> remote<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.560> controller<00:01:10.890> takes

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
of the remote this the controller takes

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.250 
of the remote this the controller takes
3<00:01:11.430> or<00:01:11.549> 4<00:01:11.760> AAA<00:01:11.970> batteries<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.570> believe<00:01:12.780> it's<00:01:12.930> 3

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
3 or 4 AAA batteries I believe it's 3

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.560 
3 or 4 AAA batteries I believe it's 3
and<00:01:14.130> here<00:01:14.580> are<00:01:14.640> some<00:01:14.729> more<00:01:14.790> pieces<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
and here are some more pieces to the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.929 
and here are some more pieces to the
quadcopter

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
quadcopter

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.580 
quadcopter
so<00:01:17.939> here's<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.270> controller<00:01:18.630> itself<00:01:19.080> as<00:01:19.380> you

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
so here's the controller itself as you

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.260 
so here's the controller itself as you
can<00:01:19.710> see<00:01:19.860> we<00:01:20.009> have<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> little<00:01:20.280> LCD<00:01:20.850> screen<00:01:21.150> when

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
can see we have a little LCD screen when

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.090 
can see we have a little LCD screen when
you<00:01:21.330> turn<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.570> on<00:01:21.689> right<00:01:22.049> hand<00:01:22.680> side<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:23.040> is

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
you turn that on right hand side this is

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.980 
you turn that on right hand side this is
gonna<00:01:23.369> be<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.880> controls<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.600> turn<00:01:24.630> the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
gonna be the controls to turn the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.870 
gonna be the controls to turn the
quadcopter<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.890> here's<00:01:26.220> me<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.460> little<00:01:26.640> power

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
quadcopter and here's me a little power

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.460 
quadcopter and here's me a little power
and<00:01:26.970> as<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.240> see<00:01:27.420> as<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.750> pull<00:01:27.930> this<00:01:28.020> up<00:01:28.259> it

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
and as you see as you pull this up it

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.580 
and as you see as you pull this up it
goes<00:01:28.619> up<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.159> down<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.549> we're<00:01:29.670> at<00:01:29.729> 100%<00:01:30.590> we

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
we have mode 1 and mode 2 mode warnings

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.770 
we have mode 1 and mode 2 mode warnings
for<00:01:38.220> beginners<00:01:38.670> but<00:01:38.850> motors<00:01:39.240> for<00:01:39.479> people<00:01:39.720> are

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
for beginners but motors for people are

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.749 
for beginners but motors for people are
more<00:01:39.900> advanced<00:01:40.170> for<00:01:40.650> me<00:01:40.680> I'm<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.009> beginner<00:01:41.400> at

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
more advanced for me I'm a beginner at

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.399 
more advanced for me I'm a beginner at
this<00:01:41.790> but<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.090> found<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.420> mode<00:01:42.689> 2<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:42.990> actually

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
this but I found that mode 2 is actually

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.280 
this but I found that mode 2 is actually
easier<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.950> control<00:01:44.630> on<00:01:45.630> top<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.140> right

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
easier to control on top of the right

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.389 
easier to control on top of the right
hand<00:01:46.320> side<00:01:46.649> wheel<00:01:46.829> button<00:01:47.130> that's<00:01:47.250> gonna

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
hand side wheel button that's gonna

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.100 
hand side wheel button that's gonna
control<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.790> lights<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.270> then<00:01:48.630> be<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> button

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
control the lights and then be a button

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.600 
control the lights and then be a button
that's<00:01:49.170> gonna<00:01:49.350> allow<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.680> quadcopter<00:01:50.100> do<00:01:50.579> a

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
that's gonna allow the quadcopter do a

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.490 
that's gonna allow the quadcopter do a
little<00:01:50.850> flip<00:01:51.149> which<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.450> pretty<00:01:51.659> now<00:01:52.290> here's

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
little flip which is pretty now here's

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.780 
little flip which is pretty now here's

the star of the show the quadcopter

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.880 
the star of the show the quadcopter
itself<00:01:54.540> as<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:55.110> see<00:01:55.350> it's<00:01:55.590> called<00:01:55.829> a

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
itself as you see it's called a

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:56.929 
itself as you see it's called a
quadcopter<00:01:56.100> because<00:01:56.579> we<00:01:56.670> have<00:01:56.759> four

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
quadcopter because we have four

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.910 
quadcopter because we have four
propellers<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.689> camera<00:01:58.530> right<00:01:58.680> here<00:01:58.829> and

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
propellers the camera right here and

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.249

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.219 

something<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.119> had<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.420> problem<00:02:09.750> with<00:02:10.020> was<00:02:10.200> I

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
something I had a problem with was I

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.750 
something I had a problem with was I
could<00:02:10.590> not<00:02:10.709> figure<00:02:10.920> out<00:02:11.099> how<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.370> get<00:02:11.580> the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
could not figure out how to get the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.490 
could not figure out how to get the
battery<00:02:12.120> on<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.930> quadcopter

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
battery on the quadcopter

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.869 
battery on the quadcopter
I<00:02:13.590> thought<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.010> battery<00:02:14.310> would<00:02:14.459> go<00:02:14.640> in<00:02:14.790> the

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
I thought the battery would go in the

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.850 
I thought the battery would go in the
back<00:02:15.090> but<00:02:15.660> it<00:02:15.750> doesn't<00:02:16.050> go<00:02:16.140> there<00:02:16.379> what<00:02:16.800> you

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
back but it doesn't go there what you

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.080 
back but it doesn't go there what you
have<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.129> do<00:02:17.250> is<00:02:17.430> you<00:02:17.520> have<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.760> fold<00:02:17.940> this

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
have to do is you have to fold this

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.210 
have to do is you have to fold this
little<00:02:18.390> flap<00:02:18.599> down<00:02:18.810> up<00:02:18.930> here<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.379> this<00:02:19.890> little

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
little flap down up here and this little

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.860 
little flap down up here and this little
power<00:02:20.459> will<00:02:20.670> come<00:02:20.849> out<00:02:21.000> in<00:02:21.360> all<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.599> do<00:02:21.720> so

cool to see what's up there I was really

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.920 
cool to see what's up there I was really
impressed<00:03:41.909> when<00:03:42.090> I<00:03:42.180> plugged<00:03:42.390> to<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.540> appeared

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
impressed when I plugged to the appeared

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.800 
impressed when I plugged to the appeared
just<00:03:43.019> see<00:03:43.409> the<00:03:43.530> quality<00:03:43.980> of<00:03:44.069> it<00:03:44.450> so<00:03:45.450> charge<00:03:45.689> of

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
just see the quality of it so charge of

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.869 
just see the quality of it so charge of
the<00:03:45.870> batteries<00:03:46.260> takes<00:03:46.439> about<00:03:46.560> 90<00:03:47.099> to<00:03:47.129> 120

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
the batteries takes about 90 to 120
