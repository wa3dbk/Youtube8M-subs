00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
common question that people have the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.929 
common question that people have the
reason<00:01:44.270> that<00:01:44.990> people<00:01:45.619> do<00:01:45.829> not<00:01:46.009> eat<00:01:46.369> egg<00:01:46.579> yolks

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
reason that people do not eat egg yolks

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.510 
reason that people do not eat egg yolks
is<00:01:47.240> because<00:01:47.659> they<00:01:47.869> think<00:01:47.990> that<00:01:48.289> it<00:01:48.919> has<00:01:49.159> a<00:01:49.189> lot

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
is because they think that it has a lot

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.639 
is because they think that it has a lot
of<00:01:49.549> cholesterol<00:01:50.149> in<00:01:50.479> fact<00:01:50.869> and<00:01:51.169> that's

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
of cholesterol in fact and that's

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.980 
of cholesterol in fact and that's
correlated<00:01:52.099> with<00:01:52.490> heart<00:01:52.729> disease<00:01:53.060> or<00:01:53.389> causes

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
correlated with heart disease or causes

correlated with heart disease or causes
heart<00:01:54.200> disease<00:01:54.259> well<00:01:55.099> yes<00:01:55.909> it<00:01:56.060> has

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
heart disease well yes it has

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:58.359 
heart disease well yes it has

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
between the cholesterol and eggs and

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.300 
between the cholesterol and eggs and
your<00:02:00.679> body's<00:02:02.560> resulting<00:02:03.560> heart<00:02:03.829> disease<00:02:04.130> if

you develop it what ends up happening is
that<00:02:07.509> cholesterol<00:02:08.509> is<00:02:08.810> produced<00:02:09.110> in<00:02:09.380> your

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
that cholesterol is produced in your

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:10.730 
that cholesterol is produced in your
liver<00:02:10.009> and

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
liver and

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.060 
liver and
as<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.890> result<00:02:11.490> of<00:02:11.820> free<00:02:12.600> radical<00:02:13.500> damage<00:02:13.530> and

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
as a result of free radical damage and

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.170 
as a result of free radical damage and
acidic<00:02:15.860> toxins<00:02:16.860> in<00:02:17.160> your<00:02:17.220> bloodstream<00:02:17.640> and

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
acidic toxins in your bloodstream and

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.490 
acidic toxins in your bloodstream and
your<00:02:18.510> blood<00:02:18.720> vessels<00:02:19.080> actually<00:02:19.200> become

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
your blood vessels actually become

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.020 
your blood vessels actually become
scarred<00:02:19.980> imagine<00:02:20.400> taking<00:02:20.670> an<00:02:20.730> agent<00:02:21.000> just

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
scarred imagine taking an agent just

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.250 
scarred imagine taking an agent just
kind<00:02:21.300> of<00:02:21.330> cutting<00:02:21.660> yourself<00:02:21.750> that's<00:02:22.140> what

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
kind of cutting yourself that's what

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.480 
kind of cutting yourself that's what
happens<00:02:22.740> in<00:02:22.830> your<00:02:22.920> arteries

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
happens in your arteries

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.460 
happens in your arteries
cholesterol<00:02:24.120> is<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.660> secrete<00:02:25.080> from<00:02:25.290> your

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
cholesterol is and secrete from your

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.330 
cholesterol is and secrete from your
liver<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:26.370> kind<00:02:26.700> of<00:02:26.760> band-aid<00:02:27.420> patch<00:02:27.750> up<00:02:28.080> and

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
liver to kind of band-aid patch up and

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.080 
liver to kind of band-aid patch up and
smooth<00:02:29.340> things<00:02:29.550> out<00:02:29.850> so<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:31.020> reason<00:02:31.590> I<00:02:32.090> really

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
smooth things out so the reason I really

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.670 
smooth things out so the reason I really
don't<00:02:33.270> know<00:02:33.330> why<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.600> reason<00:02:34.110> people<00:02:34.560> think

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
don't know why the reason people think

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.650 
don't know why the reason people think
the<00:02:34.890> cholesterol<00:02:35.310> is<00:02:35.430> bad<00:02:35.640> for<00:02:35.910> us<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.630> know

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
the cholesterol is bad for us you know

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.270 
the cholesterol is bad for us you know
it<00:02:36.960> is<00:02:37.200> really<00:02:37.470> about<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.740> sugar<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.190> the

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
it is really about the sugar and the

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.890 
it is really about the sugar and the
acidic<00:02:38.670> dye<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.060> all<00:02:39.210> the<00:02:39.270> free<00:02:39.420> radicals<00:02:39.840> are

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
acidic dye and all the free radicals are

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.170 
acidic dye and all the free radicals are
dirty<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:40.140> that<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.070> really<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.370> cause<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.700> lot

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
dirty and that is really the cause a lot

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.270 
dirty and that is really the cause a lot
of<00:02:42.330> a<00:02:42.390> lot<00:02:42.600> of<00:02:42.630> cardiovascular<00:02:43.080> issues<00:02:43.440> so

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
of a lot of cardiovascular issues so

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.700 
of a lot of cardiovascular issues so
don't<00:02:45.150> worry<00:02:45.300> about<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.870> eggs<00:02:46.020> the<00:02:46.410> eggs<00:02:46.530> are

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
don't worry about the eggs the eggs are

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.210 
don't worry about the eggs the eggs are
fine<00:02:46.950> for<00:02:46.980> you<00:02:47.280> we<00:02:47.490> will<00:02:47.670> look<00:02:47.850> exactly<00:02:48.300> at<00:02:48.750> why

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
fine for you we will look exactly at why

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.310 
fine for you we will look exactly at why
you<00:02:50.220> need<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.460> eat<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.700> whole<00:02:50.730> egg<00:02:51.150> versus<00:02:52.110> egg

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
you need to eat the whole egg versus egg

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.790 
you need to eat the whole egg versus egg
whites<00:02:52.560> alone<00:02:53.310> so<00:02:54.170> let<00:02:55.170> me<00:02:55.260> just<00:02:55.410> give<00:02:55.590> you<00:02:55.620> an

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
whites alone so let me just give you an

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.000 
whites alone so let me just give you an
idea<00:02:55.830> here<00:02:57.050> protein<00:02:58.050> right<00:02:58.470> that's<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.800> big

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
idea here protein right that's the big

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.350 
idea here protein right that's the big
reason<00:02:59.040> people<00:02:59.550> like<00:02:59.820> you<00:03:00.000> know<00:03:00.090> their<00:03:00.240> egg

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
reason people like you know their egg

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.000 
reason people like you know their egg
whites<00:03:00.570> I'm<00:03:01.350> just<00:03:01.530> going<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.680> give<00:03:01.800> you<00:03:01.860> some

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
whites I'm just going to give you some

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.800 
whites I'm just going to give you some
stats<00:03:02.220> here<00:03:02.430> this<00:03:02.670> again<00:03:02.910> this<00:03:03.060> is<00:03:03.120> based<00:03:03.480> on

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
stats here this again this is based on

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.790 
stats here this again this is based on
the<00:03:04.470> USDA<00:03:05.010> nutrient<00:03:05.820> database<00:03:06.560> so<00:03:07.560> this<00:03:07.710> is

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
the USDA nutrient database so this is

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.760 
the USDA nutrient database so this is
obviously<00:03:07.950> kind<00:03:08.340> of<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.460> big<00:03:09.680> encyclopedia<00:03:10.680> of

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
obviously kind of a big encyclopedia of

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.200 
obviously kind of a big encyclopedia of
all<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.010> new<00:03:11.100> tree<00:03:11.250> break<00:03:11.460> downs<00:03:11.670> pretty<00:03:12.060> much

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
all the new tree break downs pretty much

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.860 
all the new tree break downs pretty much
all<00:03:12.330> food<00:03:12.680> and<00:03:13.680> in<00:03:14.370> a<00:03:14.640> typical<00:03:14.760> egg<00:03:15.180> you're

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
all food and in a typical egg you're

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.040 
all food and in a typical egg you're
looking<00:03:16.230> at<00:03:16.320> about<00:03:16.500> 6<00:03:16.830> grams<00:03:17.130> of<00:03:17.310> protein<00:03:17.700> and

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
looking at about 6 grams of protein and

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.600 
looking at about 6 grams of protein and
57%<00:03:19.050> of<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.470> protein<00:03:19.890> will<00:03:20.010> be<00:03:20.100> found<00:03:20.400> in<00:03:20.550> the

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
57% of the protein will be found in the

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.300 
57% of the protein will be found in the
egg<00:03:20.760> whites<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.300> the<00:03:21.420> other<00:03:21.570> you<00:03:21.960> know<00:03:22.310> 43%

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
egg whites and the other you know 43%

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.770 
egg whites and the other you know 43%
will<00:03:23.430> be<00:03:23.520> in<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.730> egg<00:03:23.880> yolk<00:03:24.210> so<00:03:24.540> if<00:03:24.630> you're

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
will be in the egg yolk so if you're

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.030 
will be in the egg yolk so if you're
just<00:03:24.900> using<00:03:25.020> egg<00:03:25.260> white<00:03:25.470> you're<00:03:25.650> just<00:03:25.830> getting

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
just using egg white you're just getting

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.160 
just using egg white you're just getting
a<00:03:26.100> little<00:03:26.340> bit<00:03:26.490> more<00:03:26.610> than<00:03:26.790> a<00:03:26.850> half<00:03:26.880> of<00:03:27.390> the

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
a little bit more than a half of the

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.550 
a little bit more than a half of the
protein<00:03:28.650> in<00:03:28.860> that<00:03:28.890> egg<00:03:29.810> other<00:03:30.810> than<00:03:31.080> that<00:03:31.230> you

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
protein in that egg other than that you

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.820 
protein in that egg other than that you
know<00:03:32.270> 99%<00:03:33.270> of<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.720> fat<00:03:33.930> is<00:03:34.230> found<00:03:34.440> in<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.710> egg

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
know 99% of the fat is found in the egg

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.290 
know 99% of the fat is found in the egg
yolk<00:03:35.070> and<00:03:35.250> that's<00:03:35.430> where<00:03:35.580> people<00:03:35.700> have<00:03:35.970> you

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
yolk and that's where people have you

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.170 
yolk and that's where people have you
know<00:03:36.420> problem<00:03:37.200> but<00:03:38.070> again<00:03:38.130> that<00:03:38.730> is<00:03:38.760> good

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
know problem but again that is good

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.930 
know problem but again that is good
right<00:03:39.690> most<00:03:40.200> fats<00:03:40.560> are<00:03:40.770> good<00:03:40.800> you<00:03:41.610> know<00:03:41.700> some

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
right most fats are good you know some

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.610 
right most fats are good you know some
are<00:03:42.060> not<00:03:42.150> some<00:03:42.450> animal<00:03:42.780> fats<00:03:43.020> are<00:03:43.200> not<00:03:43.230> great

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
are not some animal fats are not great

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.070 
are not some animal fats are not great
but<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.820> beautiful<00:03:45.210> thing<00:03:45.330> about<00:03:45.390> egg<00:03:45.750> yolks

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
but the beautiful thing about egg yolks

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.720 
but the beautiful thing about egg yolks
is<00:03:46.710> that<00:03:47.670> they<00:03:47.790> contain<00:03:48.530> DHA<00:03:49.530> which<00:03:50.160> is<00:03:50.310> a<00:03:50.340> form

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
is that they contain DHA which is a form

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.970 
is that they contain DHA which is a form
of<00:03:50.850> omega-3<00:03:51.300> fatty<00:03:51.540> acid<00:03:51.960> which<00:03:52.500> is<00:03:52.650> actually

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
of omega-3 fatty acid which is actually

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.220 
of omega-3 fatty acid which is actually
very<00:03:53.010> very<00:03:53.250> good<00:03:53.490> for<00:03:53.640> you<00:03:54.450> know<00:03:54.570> brain

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
very very good for you know brain
