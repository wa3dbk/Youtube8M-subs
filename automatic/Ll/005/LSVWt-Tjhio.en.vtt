 dani 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:46.890
 the rest 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.030
 affiliates that are called the transmitters located in the other 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.719
 other capitals of the country they should 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.439
 but when you do not arrive you will surely notice the differences 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:16.280
 for technicians to digital TV means better coding and 'economy

 bandwidth 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.860
 but for the lay public the digital signal means an image improvement in the 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.150
 tv in some cases even without their scorer were in the logic a great 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.080
 digital advantage in the case of the hfa even in the case of italy is feign 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.770
 It matters how often 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.190
 once received decoder 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.030
 the impeccable image quality it is 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.790
 100% digital so there is no variation if you are 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.260
 5 kilometers to ten kilometers to 100 kilometers of the transmitter 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.180
 mainly in moments of complaint analogical relationship not 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.420
 analog in irs 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.850
 if you are closer you have much better quality you are more 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:56.679
 distant 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:58.070
 this is all digital 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.070
 end this situation with us 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.610
 to receive the digital signal the viewer needs to have an uhf antenna 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.750
 the common network parts that are already for sale years in the stores but so that the 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.740
 sign is decoder it is necessary for him to buy the already famous the voting sector 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.610
 one of the main mysteries that surround them is the price the government had 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.390
 promised low price close to 200 reais but in the end the manufacturers are 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.330
 developing models ranging from simpler to more complex products some 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.620
 bring even the entrance to karaoke eva says with capacity for 160 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.080
 gigabytes the processing 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.119
 heavy 

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:42.809
 and it's good it's very close to flying from a computer it has outlets

 p is a series of days if your turn can be incorporated into the system 

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:52.309
 so it has a very large range 

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:55.149
 among a product its fall that yes 

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:57.649
 low cost per product 

00:02:57.649 --> 00:03:00.719
 cocaine 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:04.770
 much talk about the interactivity that digital TV will provide 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.390
 but for this it is necessary that the set top box that is connected to a line 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.079
 or to an Internet network 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.269
 only then can your information be sent to the 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:21.109
 possibilities for this new communication are several and the broadcasters already 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:24.659
 to study how they have established contact with their 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:28.729
 viewer the future project during the saw a realization of a program 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:30.519
 Yes, it's possible 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.309
 Click above for example a tie 

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:35.749
 know that the manufacturer's tie 

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:39.779
 Then get the information where you buy a tie from tie to tie 

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:43.199
 and it's the ultimate goal is to buy this on television 

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:46.979
 always talk to anyone without talking to anyone by typing 

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:49.599
 card and everything is is this is the project 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.979
 doda activity complete interactivity
