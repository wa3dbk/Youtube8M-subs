there's only 13 people left in the game

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:22.779 
there's only 13 people left in the game
because<00:00:21.019> some<00:00:21.289> originally<00:00:22.220> there<00:00:22.429> was<00:00:22.489> a<00:00:22.550> clan

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
because some originally there was a clan

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:24.489
