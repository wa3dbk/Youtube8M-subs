00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
on this later and also have like one of

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.860 
on this later and also have like one of
my<00:05:39.430> review<00:05:39.730> videos<00:05:40.030> on<00:05:40.270> if<00:05:40.480> it's<00:05:40.660> worth

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:40.870 
my review videos on if it's worth

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.290 
my review videos on if it's worth
getting<00:05:41.230> the<00:05:41.320> structure<00:05:41.560> day<00:05:41.740> and<00:05:42.340> yeah<00:05:43.270> I

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
getting the structure day and yeah I

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.340 
getting the structure day and yeah I
figured<00:05:43.570> I'd<00:05:43.660> do<00:05:43.720> that<00:05:43.840> separate<00:05:44.140> videos

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.350 
figured I'd do that separate videos

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:45.300 
figured I'd do that separate videos
because<00:05:44.530> some<00:05:44.650> people<00:05:44.860> just<00:05:44.980> want<00:05:45.100> City

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
you're excited about it like I said we

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.010 
you're excited about it like I said we
don't<00:06:09.460> have<00:06:09.580> a<00:06:09.700> release<00:06:10.030> date<00:06:10.090> for<00:06:10.300> the<00:06:10.810> US

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.320 
don't have a release date for the US
Army<00:06:11.320> the<00:06:11.470> I<00:06:12.010> think<00:06:12.430> the<00:06:12.520> six<00:06:12.760> samurai<00:06:13.060> one

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
Army the I think the six samurai one

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.080 
Army the I think the six samurai one
can't<00:06:13.600> pushed<00:06:13.840> it<00:06:13.990> back<00:06:14.140> for<00:06:14.410> us<00:06:14.500> so<00:06:14.860> I<00:06:15.160> would

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
can't pushed it back for us so I would

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.300 
can't pushed it back for us so I would
guess<00:06:16.630> that<00:06:16.660> we<00:06:17.080> might<00:06:17.260> get<00:06:17.440> this<00:06:17.590> late<00:06:18.010> this

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
guess that we might get this late this

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:18.750 
guess that we might get this late this
year

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:18.760 
year

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.090 
year
you<00:06:19.480> know<00:06:19.570> maybe<00:06:19.750> November<00:06:20.290> or<00:06:20.440> something<00:06:20.830> to

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:21.100 
you know maybe November or something to

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.890 
you know maybe November or something to
maybe<00:06:21.340> early<00:06:21.790> next<00:06:21.970> year<00:06:22.180> would<00:06:22.360> be<00:06:22.420> my<00:06:22.630> guess

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
maybe early next year would be my guess

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.600 
maybe early next year would be my guess
