00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
bunch of collateral here um i guess it's

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.959

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
rocket launchers and it's good for

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.380

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.250 
but yeah there we get a new king double
points<00:02:39.490> but<00:02:39.850> we<00:02:40.180> don't<00:02:40.390> think<00:02:40.600> do<00:02:40.780> it<00:02:40.900> because

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
points but we don't think do it because

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.720 
points but we don't think do it because
and<00:02:41.620> just<00:02:41.770> keep<00:02:41.920> running<00:02:42.190> out<00:02:42.459> of<00:02:42.490> that

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
and just keep running out of that

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.720 
and just keep running out of that
hallway<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:46.090> other<00:02:46.240> dragon<00:02:46.930> off<00:02:47.020> obviously

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
hallway the other dragon off obviously

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.000 
hallway the other dragon off obviously
semi-auto<00:02:48.730> it<00:02:49.240> gets<00:02:49.690> extended<00:02:50.440> mags<00:02:50.769> think

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
semi-auto it gets extended mags think

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.800 
semi-auto it gets extended mags think
remember<00:02:54.010> I<00:02:56.310> don't<00:02:57.310> know<00:02:57.400> but<00:02:57.700> you<00:02:58.000> guys<00:02:58.510> can

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
remember I don't know but you guys can

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.930 
remember I don't know but you guys can
look<00:02:58.959> back<00:02:59.230> in<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.500> video<00:02:59.769> I<00:02:59.860> guess<00:03:00.190> oh<00:03:00.340> no<00:03:00.910> I

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
look back in the video I guess oh no I

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.120 
look back in the video I guess oh no I
don't<00:03:01.120> think<00:03:01.269> it<00:03:01.450> does<00:03:01.600> only<00:03:02.260> has<00:03:02.470> 10<00:03:02.860> right

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
don't think it does only has 10 right

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.780 
don't think it does only has 10 right
now<00:03:03.420> so<00:03:04.420> I<00:03:04.480> probably<00:03:05.380> should<00:03:06.100> have<00:03:06.250> another

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
now so I probably should have another

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.290 
now so I probably should have another
attachment<00:03:08.070> like<00:03:09.070> I<00:03:09.220> said<00:03:09.280> before<00:03:09.640> I<00:03:09.880> did<00:03:10.150> not

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
attachment like I said before I did not

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.270 
attachment like I said before I did not
press<00:03:10.750> or<00:03:12.150> press<00:03:13.150> out<00:03:13.570> three<00:03:14.080> we<00:03:14.500> said<00:03:14.980> it<00:03:15.130> was

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
press or press out three we said it was

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.550 
press or press out three we said it was
for<00:03:15.970> variable<00:03:16.450> zoom<00:03:16.600> I<00:03:16.870> don't<00:03:17.290> even<00:03:17.380> know<00:03:17.530> if

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
for variable zoom I don't even know if

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.259 
for variable zoom I don't even know if
he<00:03:17.680> can<00:03:17.920> get<00:03:18.100> variables<00:03:18.519> into<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.850> dragon<00:03:19.150> up

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
he can get variables into the dragon up

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.910 
he can get variables into the dragon up
never<00:03:19.840> use<00:03:20.080> it<00:03:20.110> but<00:03:21.810> it's<00:03:22.810> definitely<00:03:22.989> not<00:03:23.650> as

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
never use it but it's definitely not as

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.960 
never use it but it's definitely not as
good<00:03:24.430> for<00:03:24.700> getting<00:03:25.620> collaterals<00:03:26.820> because<00:03:27.820> you

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
good for getting collaterals because you

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.970 
good for getting collaterals because you
usually<00:03:28.120> have<00:03:28.450> to<00:03:28.480> fire<00:03:28.780> a<00:03:28.810> couple<00:03:29.200> shots<00:03:29.440> to

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
usually have to fire a couple shots to

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.930 
usually have to fire a couple shots to
kill<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.720> person<00:03:31.989> in<00:03:32.290> front<00:03:32.320> end<00:03:32.799> and<00:03:32.920> back<00:03:33.160> so

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
kill the person in front end and back so

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.360 
kill the person in front end and back so
i<00:03:34.269> think<00:03:34.390> the<00:03:34.720> l96<00:03:35.380> would<00:03:35.530> be<00:03:35.650> more<00:03:36.010> fun<00:03:36.160> if<00:03:36.220> you

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
i think the l96 would be more fun if you

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.240 
i think the l96 would be more fun if you
want<00:03:36.519> to<00:03:36.610> mess<00:03:36.730> around<00:03:37.290> cuz<00:03:38.290> it's<00:03:38.799> really<00:03:39.100> good

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
want to mess around cuz it's really good

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.800 
want to mess around cuz it's really good
