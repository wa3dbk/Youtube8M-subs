00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
house in general is very very slow so I

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.240 
house in general is very very slow so I
at<00:04:29.389> first<00:04:29.630> like<00:04:29.990> loading<00:04:30.350> issues<00:04:30.650> that<00:04:31.220> I

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
at first like loading issues that I

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.770 
at first like loading issues that I
thought<00:04:31.520> were<00:04:31.669> happening<00:04:32.150> apparently<00:04:32.690> were

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
thought were happening apparently were

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.600 
thought were happening apparently were
happening<00:04:33.169> to<00:04:33.260> everybody<00:04:33.590> so<00:04:34.160> that<00:04:34.310> was<00:04:34.460> good

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
happening to everybody so that was good

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.740 
happening to everybody so that was good
to<00:04:34.730> know<00:04:34.850> but<00:04:35.660> um<00:04:35.930> but<00:04:36.380> like<00:04:37.040> premier<00:04:37.790> was

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
to know but um but like premier was

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.000 
to know but um but like premier was
acting<00:04:39.169> Craig<00:04:39.919> ray<00:04:40.190> and<00:04:41.410> at<00:04:42.410> first<00:04:42.650> I<00:04:42.860> thought

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
acting Craig ray and at first I thought

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.700 
acting Craig ray and at first I thought
maybe<00:04:43.370> it's<00:04:43.790> a<00:04:44.000> problem<00:04:44.540> with<00:04:44.750> the<00:04:44.810> file<00:04:45.200> which

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
maybe it's a problem with the file which

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.200 
maybe it's a problem with the file which
it<00:04:45.950> might<00:04:46.100> still<00:04:46.430> be<00:04:46.580> a<00:04:46.610> problem<00:04:46.910> with<00:04:47.120> the

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
it might still be a problem with the

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.360 
it might still be a problem with the
file<00:04:47.479> I<00:04:47.810> don't<00:04:47.990> know<00:04:48.110> but<00:04:48.440> since<00:04:48.620> everything
