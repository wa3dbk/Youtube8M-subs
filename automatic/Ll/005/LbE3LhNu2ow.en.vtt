paying attention to the soy curls so

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.960 
paying attention to the soy curls so
much<00:04:59.350> as<00:04:59.500> I'm<00:04:59.620> just<00:04:59.650> paying<00:05:00.070> attention<00:05:00.700> to<00:05:00.850> the

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
onion and waiting for it to become

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.270 
onion and waiting for it to become
translucent<00:05:03.910> now<00:05:04.810> there's<00:05:05.020> enough<00:05:05.710> water<00:05:05.950> in

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
translucent now there's enough water in

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.100 
translucent now there's enough water in
the<00:05:06.460> soy<00:05:06.640> curls<00:05:07.090> to<00:05:07.300> kind<00:05:07.480> of<00:05:07.540> keep<00:05:07.720> the<00:05:07.900> pan

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
the soy curls to kind of keep the pan

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.630 
the soy curls to kind of keep the pan
moist<00:05:08.380> but<00:05:08.680> you're<00:05:08.830> still<00:05:09.040> going<00:05:09.250> to<00:05:09.310> need<00:05:09.370> to

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
moist but you're still going to need to

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.350 
moist but you're still going to need to
add<00:05:10.320> to<00:05:11.320> keep<00:05:11.770> watch<00:05:12.100> and<00:05:12.340> add<00:05:12.580> water<00:05:12.940> to<00:05:13.240> the

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
pan and keep it from burning so I still

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.060 
pan and keep it from burning so I still
probably<00:05:16.030> had<00:05:16.300> to<00:05:16.360> end<00:05:16.720> up<00:05:16.870> adding<00:05:17.290> 1/4<00:05:17.440> cup<00:05:17.919> of

probably had to end up adding 1/4 cup of

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.220 
probably had to end up adding 1/4 cup of
water<00:05:18.340> to<00:05:18.880> keep<00:05:19.030> things<00:05:19.300> going<00:05:19.690> and<00:05:19.810> then
