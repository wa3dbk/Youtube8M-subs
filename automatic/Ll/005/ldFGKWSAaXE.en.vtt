basically just better picture quality
and<00:02:08.429> then<00:02:09.149> as<00:02:09.420> full<00:02:09.810> 1080p<00:02:10.649> HD

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
and then as full 1080p HD

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000 
and then as full 1080p HD
and<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.630> has<00:02:14.750> sixty<00:02:15.750> percent<00:02:15.990> power<00:02:16.470> saving

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
and it has sixty percent power saving

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.530 
and it has sixty percent power saving
technology<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:18.420> it's<00:02:19.490> mercury-free<00:02:20.540> switch

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
technology and it's mercury-free switch

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.310 
technology and it's mercury-free switch
I<00:02:21.900> guess<00:02:22.080> is<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.290> big<00:02:22.530> plus<00:02:22.770> and<00:02:23.390> I'll<00:02:24.390> show<00:02:25.260> you
