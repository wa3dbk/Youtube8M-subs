00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.559
 well guys here enoch knew he was back on 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.719
 my second channel with this new one 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.250
 video where under great demand of 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.000
 all to show how to download and 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.980
 install pro cycling manager 2013 e 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.470
 I only did this game now because 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.650
 it came out about two days ago if not 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.689
 wrong and therefore for this 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.240
 previously it did not, it was given that 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.250
 yet there was not the cracked version 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.260
 so let's start right away by going to 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.070
 download the game from torrent files 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.790
 or give us new der as you see 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.800
 you the link description and note anyway 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.690
 she has always if you have downloaded 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.320
 downloaded fertilize I recommend it 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.210
 because it will take very little 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.980
 will download these other files 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.350
 rar 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.109
 after which if it is programmed it has been is 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.879
 exit this folder starting with 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:07.400
 a fairly long number 984 1224 not 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.780
 we open it and this folder will come out 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.880
 automatically then without and do 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.659
 nothing if we downloaded file 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.640
 torrent 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.340
 but I advise you to download it with 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.530
 torrent ie as the last option who is 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.259
 quite slow however also of 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.680
 download we have this iso file 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.380
 precisely with damon tools we wait for that 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.670
 as you assemble the image now 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.479
 click on an Aquila country share 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:39.329
 point x and leave the Italian language here 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:42.320
 ok forward we accept ahead i peak on 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:45.479
 browse because if they are another folder 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.630
 there is another disp where those are 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:52.789
 game rooms 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:55.750
 ok go ahead install and insert now 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:58.939
 the game at the end of the installation 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.039
 this activation screen will appear 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:04.820
 we who have to crack the game 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:06.950
 we click on exit and so we find the 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.110
 check and click on end 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.670
 now let's go to the computer we open better 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.810
 bd rom we go to the crack folder is 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.519
 one thing we have to do like 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.890
 administrator then studies now 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:23.660
 run the worst as an administrator 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:27.319
 will transform the game to version 1.0.0 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.510
 to version 1.0.2 point zero so if 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:33.160
 there is an italian language ok 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:36.319
 we click on next and install and so 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.720
 will insert the patch now click on 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.880
 forward we always want to check 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.519
 we care about ending for last thing 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.250
 we have to copy this pcm file 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.900
 protection point dll and the folders of the 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.739
 here we have the icon created 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.530
 on the desktop 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:54.470
 pro cycling managers do button 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.859
 right avi path file let's go 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.310
 back then in the folder 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:03.200
 main and here we do right click 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.680
 paste and shake and replace 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.930
 and so we will have cracked game and for 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.430
 start takes place the icon on the desktop 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.630
 which will be created previously 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.510
 so there is no need to pull at 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:21.549
 links and well this what now 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:25.069
 ends here I tell you that the game will be 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:27.920
 I believe the texts in Italian this is 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:31.280
 sure though with regards to audio 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.980
 of the video that is the general I think that 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.680
 will be in English then Silvia Liano e 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.450
 even better, I don't think anyway 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.670
 the important thing is that at least the tests are in 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.590
 so at least you can play Italian 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.799
 now we will have to proceed with activation 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.810
 of the game then we open the launcher in 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.420
 this case I took it from mini start 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.989
 click on play now let's go to 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.520
 computer download let's open signs in 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.190
 practice where we have 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:03.290
 game download and we have the block 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:07.370
 note the file ncp pcm of a 13 we do 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:10.250
 ap and mo with the file ie the file 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:13.400
 the cp5 serial one that convinces with 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:16.360
 this is your copy we make copy 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.840
 and we glue it inside 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.790
 activation 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.550
 then we click on the key of 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:25.640
 released activation so we will have to 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:31.340
 put this in here there are foods without 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:35.360
 any number we copy we make copy e 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.940
 we glue it here we go forward after 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.220
 a few seconds 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.020
 the game screen will appear you 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.050

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.960
 registration 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.480
 so in summary we have first 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.540
 copy this code 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.160
 the second the second is that which 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.020
 we have to use what started 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.000
 with cpi it is the third and last one 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.310
 we must use in the registration 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.760
 when we're on this here 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.980
 what begins with zero foods and 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:19.490
 that 's all with regards to the 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:21.590
 registration and nothing yet 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.000
