microwave safe plate a paper plate

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.760 
microwave safe plate a paper plate
so<00:02:13.330> I<00:02:13.360> took<00:02:13.450> a<00:02:13.600> paper<00:02:13.840> plate<00:02:14.170> I<00:02:14.410> poured<00:02:14.710> the

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
so I took a paper plate I poured the

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.530 
so I took a paper plate I poured the
whole<00:02:14.950> bag<00:02:15.160> on<00:02:15.430> it<00:02:15.580> here<00:02:15.730> here's<00:02:16.030> how<00:02:16.180> it<00:02:16.330> looks
