00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:19.180
 and here's the ritz in minecraft and today 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:23.680
 Friday I bring you a new curiosity 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:28.029
 very curious and desks and tnt stadiums 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:31.360
 and that I come to browse today because today 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:34.190
 I come to talk about the scores 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.770
 there are three types of dantes ons the 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.160
 Discreet those of zombies and spiders 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.960
 normal not the spider spoilers of 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.120
 cave that is not a tension a tension 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.620
 it's a room like this where there's love 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:52.280
 sexton and covers tom vale there is from 0 to 2 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.190
 trunks there may be 0 1 2 and there is a block 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.550
 in the middle with 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.379
 with bars, good is a strange block that 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.309
 generates monsters vale can generate 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.780
 skeletons zombies or spiders in those of 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.490
 AndrÃ© is worth 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.950
 inside the trunks that by the way 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.150
 there may be this type of trunks only 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.909
 there may be two therefore 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:20.000
 would eliminate us and it would remain that way 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.860
 generate sathers bullion metal bread 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.670
 wheat 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:28.790
 spider gunpowder 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:34.270
 cocoa bean cubes and if I remember correctly 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:36.860
 also remains and with less percentage 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.170
 music discs and with a lot less 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.420
 percentage as you saw in the last 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.930
 always view you can generate apples 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.289
 of gold with 0.7 percent of appearing 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.630
 OK 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:52.310
 that is, one in every 1,100 trunks has 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:55.729
 a black apple well well nothing I hope 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.130
 that you liked this one now I'm not going 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.560
 teach the different types of so jones 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.189
 so so far 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.710
 Well, we just saw the afternoon this 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:10.880
 it's a tangerian herd and it's very very very 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:14.870
 rare I tell you, you have never found me 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.030
 and well here you see that there are kobe rest and 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.220
 so these are all so many that 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.580
 have united and the truth is that now 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.920
 very much this seed because it looks in 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.410
 you put yourself there a little more 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.620
 away and they are about 60 cubes and come by 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.400
 here without breaking anything and you're already in a 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.950
 double scoring 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.210
 here you have bashir in case you need 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.040
 now you want or something 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.040
 let's go to the next type of champion 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.810
 simple 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.239
 this song is the one generated in the 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.310
 deserts and if it is possible 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.920
 generate in the deserts 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.290
 think special because nothing basically you 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.810
 you are walking through the desert lalalala a 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.480
 cactus lalalala a dead stubble 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.910
 lalalala a hole my god is a 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.849
 tension but what would happen then if 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.680
 you remove all the sand that is going to have 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:10.590
 will see a lot of sand you can start 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:16.110
 see that it is a real mansion 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:18.569
 with Boston with trunks and that when 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.269
 let's remove all this will be very cute 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.549
 how are you going to be able to see like that would it be in the 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.870
 late voucher 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:28.700
 let's see what's in the trunks the 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.730
 opportunity would be 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.650
 a mansion of pigs this is not because 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.280
 I have it in pittsburgh probably not 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.290
 this is a good bug no matter what 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.420
 well nothing this chair of the tension of 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.810
 the deserts are worth generating 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.150
 the deserts and we go to the last type 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.180
 of tension and the rarest of all so 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.910
 that so far is worth this song is the 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.670
 the rarest of all the deserts is worth 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.690
 I have found more than five times 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.640
 enough more and I even found 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.680
 all in the same desert and this is the 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.810
 the first one that I find I have not used yes 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.220
 because this one I found a little bit in 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:08.260
 one in a game that I had out there and 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.959
 nothing we are going to explore nadal is the 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.550
 first time you explore one of these 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:16.700
 I'm going to put advanced lime so that 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:20.360
 You can see better a moment like this 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:23.210
 great good if you let me put like that and so 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.950
 and we are going to remove 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.170
 to see that it really is a 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:31.840
 tension and there's the block 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:36.850
 in power we are going to put more 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:39.940
 more little things around here, these are not 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:43.600
 I had never investigated one are quite 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:47.280
 cures and as you will see are the most 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.280
 complicated to detect vale 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:54.440
 and one more of all after a lot and 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:58.879
 As you can see, only one trunk has been generated 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:00.710
 we go in here they were not and nothing a 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:03.139
 couple of tips for you to find them 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.639
 if there are many monsters the same or 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:06.470
 we imagine that you are six zombies 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:09.500
 or five guards as zombies or zombies 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:12.889
 look around because there may be and if 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:16.300
 you listen to a lot of monsters together ' 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.300
 they go in plan you do not listen 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:22.360
 you can look around because it can be 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:24.009
 that many zombies are being generated like this 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.929
 I hope you liked it a lot 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:28.370
 this very curious curiosity about 

00:05:25.929 --> 00:05:29.930
 pretty ons 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.590
 and careful that a pig will come out 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:35.960
 infernal there was not until another I do not think that 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:39.490
 a normal pig comes out or nothing comes out or 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.490
 it's just another bug
