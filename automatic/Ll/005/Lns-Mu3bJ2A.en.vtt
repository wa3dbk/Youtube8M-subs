00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
it matters too much you know gang speed

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.899 
it matters too much you know gang speed
is<00:01:10.650> also<00:01:11.040> what<00:01:11.250> really<00:01:11.549> matters<00:01:12.590> well<00:01:13.700> and<00:01:14.700> I'm

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
is also what really matters well and I'm

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.149 
is also what really matters well and I'm
wondering<00:01:15.360> about<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.869> they<00:01:16.020> don't<00:01:16.380> have

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
wondering about this they don't have

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.120 
wondering about this they don't have
anything<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:18.049> will<00:01:19.049> measure<00:01:19.290> your<00:01:19.500> ability

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
anything that will measure your ability

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.429 
anything that will measure your ability
to<00:01:20.369> make<00:01:21.000> people<00:01:21.150> miss<00:01:21.570> or<00:01:21.930> break<00:01:22.140> tackles

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
to make people miss or break tackles

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.289 
to make people miss or break tackles
that's<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.280> most<00:01:23.430> important<00:01:23.939> thing<00:01:24.000> with<00:01:24.270> a

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
that's the most important thing with a

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.300 
that's the most important thing with a
running<00:01:24.630> back<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:24.810> would<00:01:25.380> imagine<00:01:25.650> not<00:01:26.040> just

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
running back I would imagine not just

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.240

how<00:01:26.460> fast<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.970> run<00:01:27.000> straight<00:01:27.479> ahead<00:01:27.770> yeah<00:01:28.770> so

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
how fast you run straight ahead yeah so

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.859 
how fast you run straight ahead yeah so

like if they're definitely two different
different<00:03:58.829> personalities<00:03:59.610> I<00:03:59.820> think<00:04:00.239> uh

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
different personalities I think uh

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.740 
different personalities I think uh
Winston<00:04:01.500> is<00:04:01.890> just<00:04:02.130> like<00:04:02.400> you<00:04:03.329> know<00:04:03.480> just<00:04:03.630> a

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
Winston is just like you know just a

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.560 
Winston is just like you know just a
little<00:04:03.989> bit<00:04:04.140> more<00:04:04.290> outgoing<00:04:04.470> um<00:04:05.360> he's<00:04:06.360> just

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
little bit more outgoing um he's just

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.270 
little bit more outgoing um he's just
waiting<00:04:06.720> while<00:04:06.930> I<00:04:06.959> was<00:04:07.140> gone<00:04:07.260> I<00:04:07.560> thinking<00:04:08.040> and

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
waiting while I was gone I thinking and

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.289 
waiting while I was gone I thinking and
Mariota<00:04:09.180> is<00:04:09.360> just<00:04:09.630> a<00:04:09.750> quiet<00:04:10.650> guy<00:04:10.950> and<00:04:11.280> you<00:04:12.180> know

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
Mariota is just a quiet guy and you know

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.020 
Mariota is just a quiet guy and you know
I<00:04:12.329> think<00:04:12.750> Jost<00:04:13.170> office<00:04:13.680> you<00:04:14.280> know<00:04:14.400> he's<00:04:14.790> more

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
I think Jost office you know he's more

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.490 
I think Jost office you know he's more
of<00:04:15.090> a<00:04:15.150> quiet<00:04:15.390> guy<00:04:15.630> and<00:04:15.870> they<00:04:15.959> both<00:04:16.140> you<00:04:16.410> know

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
of a quiet guy and they both you know

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.930 
of a quiet guy and they both you know
you<00:04:16.620> can<00:04:16.769> you<00:04:16.890> could<00:04:17.039> be<00:04:17.130> a<00:04:17.160> leader<00:04:17.430> you<00:04:17.850> know

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
you can you could be a leader you know

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.779 
you can you could be a leader you know
being<00:04:18.150> quiet<00:04:18.450> too<00:04:18.780> but<00:04:19.109> I<00:04:19.320> think<00:04:19.829> in<00:04:19.890> NFL<00:04:20.340> you

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
being quiet too but I think in NFL you

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:22.580 
being quiet too but I think in NFL you
probably<00:04:21.000> have<00:04:21.180> to<00:04:21.390> you<00:04:21.870> know<00:04:21.989> open<00:04:22.200> up<00:04:22.470> a

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
probably have to you know open up a

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.560 
probably have to you know open up a
little<00:04:22.710> bit<00:04:22.950> more<00:04:23.160> or<00:04:23.490> you<00:04:23.520> know<00:04:24.180> you've<00:04:24.539> got

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
little bit more or you know you've got

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.060 
little bit more or you know you've got
to<00:04:24.810> take<00:04:24.930> control<00:04:25.169> of<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:25.380> team<00:04:25.590> i'm<00:04:25.710> not<00:04:25.890> sure

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
to take control of the team i'm not sure

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.860 
to take control of the team i'm not sure
but<00:04:26.099> i'm<00:04:26.370> just<00:04:26.640> guessing

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
but i'm just guessing

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.680 
but i'm just guessing
bigger<00:04:28.110> stage<00:04:28.440> so<00:04:28.889> um<00:04:29.190> but<00:04:29.940> I<00:04:30.030> think<00:04:30.240> Mariota

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
bigger stage so um but I think Mariota

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.170 
bigger stage so um but I think Mariota
can<00:04:30.930> can<00:04:31.380> can<00:04:31.410> do<00:04:32.160> that<00:04:32.340> as<00:04:32.460> well<00:04:32.490> I<00:04:32.669> think<00:04:33.030> he's

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
can can can do that as well I think he's

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.420 
can can can do that as well I think he's
just<00:04:33.330> I<00:04:33.540> was<00:04:34.199> just<00:04:34.380> in<00:04:34.560> a<00:04:34.620> shell<00:04:34.860> more<00:04:35.160> with<00:04:35.310> us

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
just I was just in a shell more with us

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.490 
just I was just in a shell more with us
I<00:04:35.580> really<00:04:35.850> didn't<00:04:36.060> get<00:04:36.150> to<00:04:36.360> you<00:04:37.110> know<00:04:37.229> get<00:04:37.380> to

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
I really didn't get to you know get to

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.290 
I really didn't get to you know get to
fill<00:04:37.680> that<00:04:37.710> once<00:04:38.340> it<00:04:38.490> was<00:04:38.610> just<00:04:38.820> a<00:04:38.910> little<00:04:39.150> bit

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
fill that once it was just a little bit

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.530 
fill that once it was just a little bit
more<00:04:39.660> open<00:04:40.080> so<00:04:40.530> it<00:04:41.460> was<00:04:41.550> hard<00:04:41.580> to<00:04:41.760> tell<00:04:41.970> Mariota

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
more open so it was hard to tell Mariota

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.689 
more open so it was hard to tell Mariota
so<00:04:42.780> I<00:04:42.900> can't<00:04:43.440> really<00:04:43.530> say<00:04:43.800> he's<00:04:44.220> Melvin<00:04:44.580> Gordon

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
so I can't really say he's Melvin Gordon

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:46.610 
so I can't really say he's Melvin Gordon
