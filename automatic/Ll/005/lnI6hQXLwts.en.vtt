00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.790
 hello everyone my name is hope and in this 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.940
 video I want to show you my next one 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.230
 purchase of goods for creativity 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.730
 I made this purchase in 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.279
 online store doll base 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.130
 reference you will find below and now 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.240
 let's see everything in order let's start 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.189
 from the most important 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.250
 This is this bottle Mr. 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.769
 super glue is the same claire who 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.510
 uses walker and for their models 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.030
 to fix the picture on the dolls 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.489
 this cover is frosted 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.190
 sura filter that is how promises 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.200
 manufacturer this filter will protect 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.719
 material of which the doll is made 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.870
 against yellowing when exposed to solar 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.910
 rays 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.770
 Spro is used and as a base 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.789
 coatings and as a topcoat 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:03.239
 and for fixing individual stages 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:07.920
 we work here it turns out very thin 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.110
 In this case, I took a matte flat this 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.330
 the cover is really matte she doesn't 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.420
 leave no glossy shine and 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.090
 the pupa's face will look tender 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.710
 matte velvety very really 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.710
 beautiful and natural 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:32.420
 spray is made in japan practically 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.880
 everything in japanese needs to be used 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.000
 its only well ventilated 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.640
 the premises 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:45.130
 here is a small instruction 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:45.130
 in English we see each other we put a cream 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:55.370
 I bought it because I'm going 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:58.250
 try yourself redrawing dolls and me 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.960
 I realized that acrylic paints are simply not 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.930
 achieve interesting results 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.300
 which I wanted you which can 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.650
 achieve using watercolor pencils 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.610
 and pastel and just this clear 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:13.700
 designed to fasten 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.250
 drawing with it you can 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.320
 secure and bed and watercolor 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.690
 pencil and because of it they are not 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:24.350
 blurred not lubricated unlike 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.300
 the case when applied any varnish 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.490
 or fixer some kind of coating with 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.380
 using a brush anyway i 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.990
 I tried watercolor pencil and 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.120
 varnish and they right there 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.260
 spread out turn into such 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.490
 blurry paint 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:45.440
 which of course spoil the work and this spray 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:48.590
 it is a must and very important 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.800
 a tool that is useful to you if you 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.910
 decide to redraw the dolls and do 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.310
 really beautiful and interesting 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.739
 work 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.370
 Further it here such here the leaves are 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.400
 butterflies 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.610
 These are grinding sponges with different sizes. 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:08.050
 grain from what was available I took 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:11.510
 super fine and ultra fine 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:14.209
 I will use for polishing products 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.780
 polymer clay sponge very 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:20.850
 comfortable 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:23.330
 they wander soft 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.920
 they can be washed repeatedly 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.780
 also took such a metal one 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.920
 tool 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.880
 I will use it when 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.760
 modeling 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:37.290
 when working with polymer clay on one 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:40.560
 end of a small ball another tip 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:48.090
 slightly flattened and looks like this 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:52.740
 a small spatula and the last one in this 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:54.750
 ordering this is such a silicone brush i 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.860
 I will use it also to work with 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.590
 polymer clay for modeling 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.990
 to smooth out some areas 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:07.830
 trim it seemed to me very 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:09.780
 funny in this brush is what is applied 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.070
 not the logo of any particular 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.930
 producer to find applied logo 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:20.520
 the store where I was making the whole purchase 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:23.780
 this doll base is so very nice 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:29.790
 fun detail especially as the logo 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:32.340
 pretty here so small 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:35.130
 but I really liked everything 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.490
 happy everyone tell me what you buy 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.080
