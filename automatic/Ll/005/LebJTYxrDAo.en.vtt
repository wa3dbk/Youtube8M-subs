during<00:00:24.420> this<00:00:24.539> tutorial<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:25.289> will<00:00:25.380> go<00:00:25.650> over<00:00:25.859> how

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
during this tutorial I will go over how

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.650 
during this tutorial I will go over how
to<00:00:26.010> create<00:00:26.099> an<00:00:26.519> object<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:27.060> be<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.269> source<00:00:27.510> of

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
to create an object to be the source of

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.230 
to create an object to be the source of
the<00:00:27.720> particles<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.500> simple<00:00:29.340> driver<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.939> trigger

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
the particles a simple driver to trigger

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.810 
the particles a simple driver to trigger
the<00:00:30.480> exploding<00:00:30.960> glass<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.619> using<00:00:32.520> shape

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
the exploding glass and using shape

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.000 
the exploding glass and using shape
instances<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.600> create<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.020> glass<00:00:34.260> chart<00:00:34.649> i

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
instances to create the glass chart i

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.220 
instances to create the glass chart i
will<00:00:35.700> then<00:00:35.880> conclude<00:00:36.300> with<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.600> basic<00:00:37.110> overview

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
will then conclude with a basic overview

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.670 
will then conclude with a basic overview
of<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.890> compositing<00:00:38.550> for<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.850> final<00:00:39.149> shot<00:00:39.680> so

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
of the compositing for the final shot so

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.160 
of the compositing for the final shot so
i've<00:00:40.800> loaded<00:00:41.010> up<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.430> starter<00:00:41.790> scene<00:00:42.059> which<00:00:42.989> i

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
i've loaded up the starter scene which i

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.020 
i've loaded up the starter scene which i
will<00:00:43.230> include<00:00:43.710> with<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.950> tutorial<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.700> this

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
will include with the tutorial and this

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.010 
will include with the tutorial and this
is<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.329> max<00:00:45.680> 2008<00:00:47.059> and<00:00:48.059> basically<00:00:48.570> what<00:00:48.690> i<00:00:48.719> have

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
is in max 2008 and basically what i have

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.459 
is in max 2008 and basically what i have
here<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:50.430> very<00:00:51.270> very<00:00:51.420> simple<00:00:51.690> skyscraper

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
here is a very very simple skyscraper

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.410 
here is a very very simple skyscraper
that's<00:00:52.860> just<00:00:53.070> made<00:00:53.309> out<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.940> standard

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
that's just made out of the standard

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.600 
that's just made out of the standard
primitive<00:00:54.840> box<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.590> i<00:00:55.860> created<00:00:56.370> some

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
primitive box and i created some

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.549 
primitive box and i created some
dividers<00:00:57.120> in<00:00:57.360> here<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.809> make<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.109> look<00:00:58.260> like<00:00:58.410> it

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
dividers in here to make it look like it

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.240 
dividers in here to make it look like it
has<00:00:58.739> windows<00:00:59.449> i<00:01:00.449> also<00:01:01.020> added<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.829> just<00:01:02.160> a

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
has windows i also added in a just a

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.889 
has windows i also added in a just a
very<00:01:02.280> simple<00:01:02.670> camera<00:01:03.120> movement<00:01:03.660> that's<00:01:03.809> going

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
very simple camera movement that's going

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.780 
very simple camera movement that's going
to<00:01:04.049> track<00:01:04.350> as<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.129> building's<00:01:05.519> exploding

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
to track as the the building's exploding

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.740 
to track as the the building's exploding
out<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.740> I<00:01:07.740> have<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.280> plane<00:01:08.939> in<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.270> background

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
out and I have a plane in the background

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.499 
out and I have a plane in the background
that<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.710> 3d<00:01:11.100> studio<00:01:13.549> map<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.820> Hong<00:01:15.240> Kong

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
that is the 3d studio map of Hong Kong

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.770 
that is the 3d studio map of Hong Kong
and<00:01:15.750> then<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.350> also<00:01:16.530> created<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.659> duplicate<00:01:18.659> of

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
and then I also created a duplicate of

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.420 
and then I also created a duplicate of
that<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.259> stuck<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.650> front<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.310> that

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
that that I stuck in front of it so that

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.280 
that that I stuck in front of it so that
it<00:01:20.549> we<00:01:20.670> reflect<00:01:21.060> off<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.479> skyscraper

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
it we reflect off of the skyscraper

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.230 
it we reflect off of the skyscraper
just<00:01:23.220> all<00:01:23.369> for<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.640> purpose<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.119> this

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
just all for the purpose of this

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.499 
just all for the purpose of this
tutorial<00:01:25.189> the<00:01:26.189> skyscraper<00:01:26.880> has<00:01:27.119> already<00:01:27.390> been

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
tutorial the skyscraper has already been

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.770 
tutorial the skyscraper has already been
texturized<00:01:28.200> I'm<00:01:28.619> using<00:01:29.430> mental<00:01:29.909> ray<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.540> this

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
texturized I'm using mental ray and this

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.990 
texturized I'm using mental ray and this
is<00:01:30.930> just<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.229> basic<00:01:31.650> chrome<00:01:32.040> inside<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.880> the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
is just the basic chrome inside of the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.710 
is just the basic chrome inside of the
architecture<00:01:33.689> design<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.049> then<00:01:35.009> the

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
architecture design and then the

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.990 
architecture design and then the
dividers<00:01:36.720> here<00:01:36.990> are<00:01:37.140> just<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.409> simple<00:01:37.770> mat<00:01:38.000> so

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
dividers here are just a simple mat so

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.660 
dividers here are just a simple mat so
the<00:01:39.119> first<00:01:39.329> thing<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.509> we<00:01:39.720> wanted<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.140> create

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
the first thing that we wanted to create

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.630 
the first thing that we wanted to create
to<00:01:41.670> do<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.630> actual<00:01:43.229> area<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:44.369> this

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
to do this is the actual area of this

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.609 
to do this is the actual area of this
skyscraper<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:45.930> going<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.320> have<00:01:46.500> the

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
skyscraper that is going to have the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.069 
skyscraper that is going to have the
glass<00:01:46.860> blowing<00:01:47.280> out<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.880> we're<00:01:48.720> going<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.869> do

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
glass blowing out and we're going to do

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.050 
glass blowing out and we're going to do
that<00:01:49.290> by<00:01:49.530> just<00:01:49.560> creating<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.399> very<00:01:50.640> simple

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
that by just creating a very simple

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.179 
that by just creating a very simple
piece<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.360> geometry<00:01:51.630> that's<00:01:52.200> going<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.590> act<00:01:52.799> as

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
piece of geometry that's going to act as

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.850 
piece of geometry that's going to act as
the<00:01:53.579> emitter<00:01:53.880> for<00:01:54.180> that<00:01:54.380> so<00:01:55.380> I'm<00:01:55.560> going<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.770> go

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
the emitter for that so I'm going to go

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.510 
the emitter for that so I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.509> jump<00:01:57.509> or<00:01:57.780> expand<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.280> top

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
ahead and jump or expand the the top

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.789 
ahead and jump or expand the the top
front<00:01:59.880> window<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.600> I'm<00:02:01.380> just<00:02:01.560> going<00:02:01.710> to

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
front window and I'm just going to

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.539 
front window and I'm just going to
create<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.219> very<00:02:02.759> simple<00:02:03.479> Jaggi<00:02:04.170> pattern<00:02:05.009> here

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
create a very simple Jaggi pattern here

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.850 
create a very simple Jaggi pattern here
that<00:02:05.700> is<00:02:06.509> going<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.899> be<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.140> emitter<00:02:07.469> but<00:02:07.740> I'm

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
that is going to be the emitter but I'm

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.360 
that is going to be the emitter but I'm
also<00:02:08.069> going<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.459> use<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.879> as<00:02:09.060> my<00:02:09.539> mask

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:10.370 
also going to use it as my mask

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.569 
also going to use it as my mask
to<00:02:11.370> show<00:02:11.879> where<00:02:12.420> there's<00:02:12.719> a<00:02:12.810> nail<00:02:13.439> a<00:02:13.739> hole<00:02:14.370> in

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:14.579 
to show where there's a nail a hole in

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.729 
to show where there's a nail a hole in
the<00:02:14.700> building<00:02:15.030> after<00:02:15.299> this<00:02:15.689> explosion<00:02:16.200> rips

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
the building after this explosion rips

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.179 
the building after this explosion rips
through<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.389> and<00:02:18.389> you<00:02:19.200> know<00:02:19.230> this<00:02:19.469> is<00:02:19.590> very

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:20.189 
through it and you know this is very

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:22.489 
through it and you know this is very
simple<00:02:20.579> and<00:02:20.730> nobody<00:02:21.659> is<00:02:21.780> really<00:02:21.989> going<00:02:22.109> to<00:02:22.290> see

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:22.499 
simple and nobody is really going to see

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:30.770 
simple and nobody is really going to see
it<00:02:22.879> exactly<00:02:28.010> so<00:02:29.010> I<00:02:29.040> I<00:02:29.579> want<00:02:29.969> to<00:02:30.060> position<00:02:30.359> it<00:02:30.599> so

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
it exactly so I I want to position it so

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.160 
it exactly so I I want to position it so
it's<00:02:30.930> just<00:02:30.989> sitting<00:02:31.590> right<00:02:31.680> on<00:02:31.859> the<00:02:32.129> front<00:02:32.400> and

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
it's just sitting right on the front and

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.509 
it's just sitting right on the front and
I'm<00:02:34.170> going<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.319> go<00:02:34.469> ahead<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:34.829> rename<00:02:35.159> it<00:02:35.219> now

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
I'm going to go ahead and rename it now

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.280 
I'm going to go ahead and rename it now
so<00:02:35.819> that<00:02:35.969> it<00:02:36.060> has<00:02:36.209> a<00:02:36.239> name<00:02:36.450> that<00:02:36.659> I'll<00:02:36.750> be<00:02:37.109> able

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
so that it has a name that I'll be able

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.739 
so that it has a name that I'll be able
to<00:02:37.379> find<00:02:37.650> later<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:39.060> I'm<00:02:39.269> going<00:02:39.389> to<00:02:39.450> call<00:02:39.629> it

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:39.749 
to find later and I'm going to call it

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:44.390 
to find later and I'm going to call it
particle<00:02:40.739> position<00:02:41.249> object<00:02:42.409> I<00:02:43.409> don't<00:02:44.129> need<00:02:44.310> to

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
particle position object I don't need to

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.159 
particle position object I don't need to
keep<00:02:44.609> it<00:02:44.790> as<00:02:44.969> a<00:02:45.030> spline<00:02:45.599> I'm<00:02:45.870> going<00:02:45.989> to<00:02:46.049> go

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:46.169 
keep it as a spline I'm going to go

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:49.069 
keep it as a spline I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.469> convert<00:02:46.650> it<00:02:46.919> into<00:02:47.069> a<00:02:47.219> poly<00:02:47.579> and<00:02:48.079> as

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
ahead and convert it into a poly and as

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.539 
ahead and convert it into a poly and as
you<00:02:49.230> see<00:02:49.439> now<00:02:49.620> it's<00:02:49.799> a<00:02:49.889> solid<00:02:50.310> piece<00:02:50.489> of

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
you see now it's a solid piece of

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.569 
you see now it's a solid piece of
geometry<00:02:51.230> that<00:02:52.230> will<00:02:52.799> be<00:02:52.949> able<00:02:53.099> to<00:02:53.250> be<00:02:53.340> used

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
geometry that will be able to be used

00:02:53.579 --> 00:03:07.099 
geometry that will be able to be used
for<00:02:54.199> our<00:02:55.790> particles<00:03:01.250> okay<00:03:03.709> so<00:03:05.959> we're<00:03:06.959> going<00:03:07.049> to

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
for our particles okay so we're going to

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:08.869 
for our particles okay so we're going to
go<00:03:07.260> ahead<00:03:07.409> and<00:03:07.799> we're<00:03:07.919> going<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.099> use<00:03:08.250> particle

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
go ahead and we're going to use particle

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.179 
go ahead and we're going to use particle
flow<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.150> do<00:03:09.389> this<00:03:09.599> so<00:03:10.409> I'm<00:03:10.530> going<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.709> go<00:03:10.829> ahead

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189 
flow to do this so I'm going to go ahead

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:15.259 
flow to do this so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:03:11.519> bring<00:03:11.760> particle<00:03:12.269> flow<00:03:12.480> up<00:03:14.030> I'm<00:03:15.030> going<00:03:15.180> to

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
and bring particle flow up I'm going to

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.280 
and bring particle flow up I'm going to
create<00:03:15.449> it<00:03:15.540> here<00:03:17.720> and<00:03:18.720> we'll<00:03:18.840> go<00:03:18.989> ahead<00:03:19.079> and

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
create it here and we'll go ahead and

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.619 
create it here and we'll go ahead and
open<00:03:19.560> up<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.799> window<00:03:20.129> now<00:03:21.030> I<00:03:21.060> have<00:03:21.329> a<00:03:21.359> dual

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
open up the window now I have a dual

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.569 
open up the window now I have a dual
monitor<00:03:21.870> system<00:03:22.530> so<00:03:22.709> sometimes<00:03:23.129> these<00:03:23.310> things

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
monitor system so sometimes these things

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.399 
monitor system so sometimes these things
pop<00:03:23.849> up<00:03:24.030> in<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.239> other<00:03:24.359> window<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:25.019> sometimes

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:25.409 
pop up in the other window and sometimes

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:27.740 
pop up in the other window and sometimes
I'll<00:03:25.560> just<00:03:25.590> drag<00:03:25.979> them<00:03:26.129> off<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.459> screen<00:03:26.750> which

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
I'll just drag them off the screen which

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.390 
I'll just drag them off the screen which
is<00:03:27.900> quicker<00:03:28.169> than<00:03:28.259> closing<00:03:28.919> and<00:03:29.220> opening

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
is quicker than closing and opening

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.990 
is quicker than closing and opening
these<00:03:30.109> so<00:03:31.109> right<00:03:31.319> now<00:03:31.439> it's<00:03:31.739> all<00:03:32.069> the<00:03:32.669> default

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
these so right now it's all the default

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.939 
these so right now it's all the default
settings<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.629> it's<00:03:33.750> hooked<00:03:34.049> to<00:03:34.319> actually

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:34.949 
settings and it's hooked to actually

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:37.099 
settings and it's hooked to actually
emit<00:03:35.220> particles<00:03:35.459> from<00:03:35.939> this<00:03:36.180> part<00:03:36.479> position

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
emit particles from this part position

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.830 
emit particles from this part position
icon<00:03:37.560> what<00:03:38.340> we<00:03:38.459> wanted<00:03:38.759> to<00:03:38.819> do<00:03:39.030> instead<00:03:39.569> though

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
icon what we wanted to do instead though

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.689 
icon what we wanted to do instead though
is<00:03:40.019> we<00:03:40.169> wanted<00:03:40.409> to<00:03:40.470> actually<00:03:41.129> emit<00:03:41.459> particles

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:41.699 
is we wanted to actually emit particles

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:43.759 
is we wanted to actually emit particles
from<00:03:42.180> this<00:03:42.419> new<00:03:42.599> piece<00:03:42.810> of<00:03:42.840> geometry<00:03:43.259> we

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
from this new piece of geometry we

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.580 
from this new piece of geometry we
created<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:44.519> that's<00:03:45.090> very<00:03:45.299> simple<00:03:45.569> to<00:03:45.689> do<00:03:45.900> we

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
created and that's very simple to do we

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.740 
created and that's very simple to do we
just<00:03:46.799> need<00:03:46.949> to<00:03:47.069> replace<00:03:47.220> this<00:03:47.759> position<00:03:48.239> icon

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
just need to replace this position icon

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.209 
just need to replace this position icon
with<00:03:49.259> the<00:03:49.979> position<00:03:50.879> object<00:03:51.560> instead<00:03:52.560> so<00:03:53.129> I'm

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:53.219 
with the position object instead so I'm

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:54.319 
with the position object instead so I'm
just<00:03:53.370> going<00:03:53.519> to<00:03:53.549> go<00:03:53.639> ahead<00:03:53.849> and<00:03:53.969> just<00:03:54.060> drag

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
just going to go ahead and just drag

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.050 
just going to go ahead and just drag
that<00:03:54.389> up<00:03:54.810> and<00:03:55.169> over<00:03:55.379> the<00:03:55.500> top<00:03:55.680> of<00:03:55.739> it<00:03:56.009> and<00:03:56.879> then

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
that up and over the top of it and then

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.059 
that up and over the top of it and then
I'll<00:03:57.180> click<00:03:57.389> on<00:03:57.569> it<00:03:57.750> and<00:03:57.959> then<00:03:58.319> I<00:03:58.349> can<00:03:58.590> say<00:03:58.799> add

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
I'll click on it and then I can say add

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.550 
I'll click on it and then I can say add
from<00:03:59.400> a<00:03:59.489> list<00:03:59.759> and<00:04:00.060> there's<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:01.109> particle

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
from a list and there's the particle

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.020 
from a list and there's the particle
position<00:04:01.919> object<00:04:02.310> that<00:04:02.459> we<00:04:02.579> just<00:04:02.790> created<00:04:03.209> and

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
position object that we just created and

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.219 
position object that we just created and
I'm<00:04:06.030> going<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.239> go<00:04:06.329> ahead<00:04:06.449> and<00:04:06.750> change<00:04:06.930> the

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:07.229 
I'm going to go ahead and change the

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:09.709 
I'm going to go ahead and change the
birth<00:04:07.439> right<00:04:08.099> now<00:04:08.250> it's<00:04:08.459> going<00:04:09.030> from<00:04:09.269> emitting

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:09.719 
birth right now it's going from emitting

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:11.899 
birth right now it's going from emitting
from<00:04:09.900> 0<00:04:10.229> to<00:04:10.349> 30<00:04:10.919> and<00:04:11.219> I<00:04:11.310> actually<00:04:11.459> just<00:04:11.729> want

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:11.909 
from 0 to 30 and I actually just want

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:14.920 
from 0 to 30 and I actually just want
everything<00:04:12.120> to<00:04:12.269> emit<00:04:12.659> from<00:04:12.840> frame<00:04:13.560> 0<00:04:14.039> to<00:04:14.250> 0<00:04:14.549> and

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
everything to emit from frame 0 to 0 and

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.529 
everything to emit from frame 0 to 0 and
as<00:04:15.930> you<00:04:16.049> can<00:04:16.169> see<00:04:16.229> here<00:04:17.070> we<00:04:18.060> have<00:04:18.090> the

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
as you can see here we have the

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.620 
as you can see here we have the
particles<00:04:19.019> are<00:04:19.169> stuck<00:04:19.409> onto<00:04:19.709> this<00:04:19.829> object<00:04:20.070> and

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
particles are stuck onto this object and

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.990 
particles are stuck onto this object and
if<00:04:21.630> we<00:04:21.779> scroll<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.289> slider<00:04:23.219> forward<00:04:23.729> you<00:04:23.849> see

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
if we scroll the slider forward you see

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.150 
if we scroll the slider forward you see
the

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
the

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.530 
the
particles<00:04:24.550> are<00:04:24.640> already<00:04:24.970> starting<00:04:25.120> to<00:04:25.300> fall

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
particles are already starting to fall

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.570 
particles are already starting to fall
which<00:04:26.110> is<00:04:26.230> not<00:04:26.380> actually<00:04:26.890> what<00:04:27.040> we<00:04:27.190> wanted<00:04:27.460> to

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
which is not actually what we wanted to

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.090 
which is not actually what we wanted to
do<00:04:27.730> at<00:04:27.850> this<00:04:27.970> point<00:04:28.380> and<00:04:29.380> that's<00:04:29.560> happening

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
do at this point and that's happening

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.100 
do at this point and that's happening
because<00:04:30.250> we<00:04:30.580> have<00:04:30.820> this<00:04:31.210> the<00:04:31.480> default<00:04:31.870> speed

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
because we have this the default speed

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.890 
because we have this the default speed
is<00:04:32.470> on<00:04:32.820> and<00:04:33.820> we<00:04:34.000> actually<00:04:34.180> don't<00:04:34.510> need<00:04:34.750> the

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
is on and we actually don't need the

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.260 
is on and we actually don't need the
speed<00:04:35.170> at<00:04:35.320> all<00:04:35.500> so<00:04:35.890> we'll<00:04:36.640> just<00:04:36.820> go<00:04:36.940> ahead<00:04:36.970> and

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
speed at all so we'll just go ahead and

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.190 
speed at all so we'll just go ahead and
delete<00:04:37.360> that<00:04:37.600> we<00:04:38.200> also<00:04:38.350> don't<00:04:38.620> need<00:04:38.830> the

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
delete that we also don't need the

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.770 
delete that we also don't need the
rotation<00:04:41.200> and<00:04:41.380> we<00:04:41.530> don't<00:04:41.710> need<00:04:41.830> a<00:04:41.890> shape<00:04:42.780> so

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
rotation and we don't need a shape so

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.360 
rotation and we don't need a shape so
now<00:04:43.990> if<00:04:44.140> we<00:04:44.290> scroll<00:04:44.530> through<00:04:44.590> we<00:04:44.950> see<00:04:45.130> that<00:04:45.250> the

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
now if we scroll through we see that the

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.910 
now if we scroll through we see that the
particle<00:04:45.910> actually<00:04:46.300> does<00:04:46.480> nothing<00:04:46.930> which<00:04:47.890> is

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
particle actually does nothing which is

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.920 
particle actually does nothing which is
exactly<00:04:48.430> what<00:04:48.670> we<00:04:48.820> wanted<00:04:49.090> to<00:04:49.150> do<00:04:49.330> at<00:04:49.600> this

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
exactly what we wanted to do at this

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.440 
exactly what we wanted to do at this
point<00:04:50.320> because<00:04:51.250> we<00:04:51.610> are<00:04:51.820> actually<00:04:52.000> going<00:04:52.390> to

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
point because we are actually going to

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.170 
point because we are actually going to
be<00:04:52.570> using<00:04:52.990> these<00:04:53.110> particle<00:04:53.680> points<00:04:54.130> as<00:04:54.280> our

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
be using these particle points as our

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.270 
be using these particle points as our
collision<00:04:55.720> objects<00:04:56.220> and<00:04:58.410> at<00:04:59.410> this<00:04:59.680> point<00:05:00.070> this

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
collision objects and at this point this

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.940 
collision objects and at this point this
is<00:05:00.340> really<00:05:00.790> just<00:05:00.820> a<00:05:01.090> triggering<00:05:01.570> mechanism<00:05:01.950> so

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
is really just a triggering mechanism so

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.220 
is really just a triggering mechanism so
we<00:05:03.550> don't<00:05:03.760> want<00:05:03.940> these<00:05:04.090> particles<00:05:04.600> to<00:05:04.720> move<00:05:04.900> we

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
we don't want these particles to move we

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.630 
we don't want these particles to move we
don't<00:05:05.380> want<00:05:05.530> to<00:05:05.590> do<00:05:05.800> anything<00:05:06.040> we<00:05:06.280> just<00:05:06.310> want

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
don't want to do anything we just want

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.520 
don't want to do anything we just want
them<00:05:06.700> to<00:05:06.820> sit<00:05:07.000> on<00:05:07.030> this<00:05:07.240> object<00:05:07.570> and<00:05:07.960> wait<00:05:08.260> for

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
them to sit on this object and wait for

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.410 
them to sit on this object and wait for
some<00:05:08.770> object<00:05:09.310> to<00:05:09.430> collide<00:05:09.820> with<00:05:09.850> them<00:05:10.180> and

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
some object to collide with them and

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.110 
some object to collide with them and
then<00:05:10.570> we'll<00:05:10.750> generate<00:05:11.170> our<00:05:11.410> next<00:05:12.120> particles

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
then we'll generate our next particles

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.910 
then we'll generate our next particles
which<00:05:13.270> will<00:05:13.390> be<00:05:13.540> the<00:05:13.660> glass<00:05:13.900> shards<00:05:14.290> exploding

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:14.920 
which will be the glass shards exploding

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.340 
which will be the glass shards exploding
out<00:05:15.070> of<00:05:15.100> the<00:05:15.220> building<00:05:15.780> what<00:05:16.780> we<00:05:16.930> want<00:05:17.110> to<00:05:17.230> do

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
out of the building what we want to do

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.170 
out of the building what we want to do
is<00:05:17.620> we<00:05:17.920> actually<00:05:17.950> need<00:05:18.460> to<00:05:18.490> create<00:05:19.000> the

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
is we actually need to create the

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.270 
is we actually need to create the
collision<00:05:19.660> object<00:05:20.110> that's<00:05:20.320> going<00:05:20.740> to<00:05:20.980> hit

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
collision object that's going to hit

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.790 
collision object that's going to hit
these<00:05:21.490> particles<00:05:22.090> and<00:05:22.390> trigger<00:05:22.990> the<00:05:23.410> glass

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
these particles and trigger the glass

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.330 
these particles and trigger the glass
shards<00:05:24.100> shooting<00:05:24.550> out<00:05:25.020> into<00:05:26.020> the<00:05:26.470> open<00:05:27.130> space

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
shards shooting out into the open space

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.780 
shards shooting out into the open space
so<00:05:28.240> to<00:05:28.300> do<00:05:28.630> that<00:05:28.860> we're<00:05:29.860> going<00:05:29.980> to<00:05:30.040> create<00:05:30.490> a

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
so to do that we're going to create a

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.360 
so to do that we're going to create a
really<00:05:31.360> simple<00:05:31.750> object<00:05:32.230> which<00:05:33.010> is<00:05:33.160> just

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
really simple object which is just

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.390 
really simple object which is just
another<00:05:33.640> primitive<00:05:34.030> box<00:05:34.600> and<00:05:35.100> I'm<00:05:36.100> going<00:05:36.130> to

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
another primitive box and I'm going to

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.820 
another primitive box and I'm going to
just<00:05:36.690> draw<00:05:37.690> it<00:05:37.840> in<00:05:37.960> here<00:05:38.470> and<00:05:40.680> get<00:05:41.680> it

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
just draw it in here and get it

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.420 
just draw it in here and get it
positioned<00:05:42.450> and<00:05:43.830> I'm<00:05:44.830> going<00:05:44.950> to<00:05:44.980> go<00:05:45.100> ahead<00:05:45.220> and

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
positioned and I'm going to go ahead and

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.850 
positioned and I'm going to go ahead and
turn<00:05:45.550> AutoKey<00:05:46.060> on<00:05:46.480> so<00:05:47.230> we<00:05:47.500> want<00:05:47.710> it<00:05:47.800> to

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
turn AutoKey on so we want it to

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.370 
turn AutoKey on so we want it to
actually<00:05:48.430> hit<00:05:48.760> these<00:05:49.210> particles<00:05:49.870> and<00:05:50.080> start

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
actually hit these particles and start

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.810 
actually hit these particles and start
it's<00:05:51.630> emitting<00:05:52.630> or<00:05:53.050> triggering<00:05:53.650> right<00:05:54.490> here

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
it's emitting or triggering right here

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.930 
it's emitting or triggering right here
at<00:05:55.000> frame<00:05:55.330> 10<00:05:55.690> and<00:05:56.070> then<00:05:57.070> we<00:05:57.280> want<00:05:57.550> it<00:05:57.610> to<00:05:57.760> get

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
at frame 10 and then we want it to get

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.640 
at frame 10 and then we want it to get
all<00:05:58.240> the<00:05:58.480> way<00:05:58.600> to<00:05:58.630> the<00:05:58.930> end<00:05:59.080> of<00:05:59.200> the<00:05:59.290> building

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
all the way to the end of the building

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:07.110 
all the way to the end of the building
by<00:05:59.919> frame<00:06:03.030> 60

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.990 

so<00:06:08.120> there<00:06:08.300> we<00:06:08.419> have<00:06:08.630> it<00:06:08.660> now<00:06:08.930> in<00:06:09.889> order<00:06:10.699> for<00:06:10.970> us

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
so there we have it now in order for us

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.760 
so there we have it now in order for us
to<00:06:11.120> actually<00:06:11.750> use<00:06:11.900> this<00:06:12.050> as<00:06:12.229> a<00:06:12.259> collision

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
to actually use this as a collision

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.040 
to actually use this as a collision
object<00:06:13.340> we<00:06:13.550> need<00:06:13.880> to<00:06:14.090> go<00:06:14.300> ahead<00:06:14.630> and<00:06:14.810> add<00:06:15.020> a

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
object we need to go ahead and add a

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.499 
object we need to go ahead and add a
deflector<00:06:15.949> so<00:06:16.580> I'm<00:06:16.699> going<00:06:16.820> to<00:06:16.880> go<00:06:16.970> over<00:06:17.300> and

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:17.509 
deflector so I'm going to go over and

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:19.120 
deflector so I'm going to go over and
there's<00:06:17.660> many<00:06:17.840> deflectors<00:06:18.440> to<00:06:18.590> choose<00:06:18.830> from

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.130 
there's many deflectors to choose from

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:20.350 
there's many deflectors to choose from
but<00:06:19.460> I'm<00:06:19.580> going<00:06:19.729> to<00:06:19.789> go<00:06:19.850> ahead<00:06:19.940> and<00:06:20.150> just<00:06:20.270> use

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 
but I'm going to go ahead and just use

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.090 
but I'm going to go ahead and just use
the<00:06:20.780> u<00:06:20.930> deflector<00:06:23.080> and<00:06:24.080> it<00:06:24.440> allows<00:06:24.650> me<00:06:24.830> to<00:06:24.919> pick

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:25.100 
the u deflector and it allows me to pick

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.180 
the u deflector and it allows me to pick
a<00:06:25.310> geometry<00:06:25.759> to<00:06:26.210> act<00:06:26.419> as<00:06:26.800> the<00:06:27.800> collision

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190 
a geometry to act as the collision

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.230 
a geometry to act as the collision
object<00:06:28.610> so<00:06:29.419> now<00:06:29.630> I<00:06:30.020> have<00:06:30.350> that<00:06:30.560> set<00:06:31.000> so<00:06:32.000> I<00:06:32.060> can

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 
object so now I have that set so I can

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:40.270 
object so now I have that set so I can
go<00:06:32.360> back<00:06:32.570> into<00:06:32.900> our<00:06:33.350> particle<00:06:33.889> view<00:06:36.820> and<00:06:39.280> add

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.280 
go back into our particle view and add

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.610 
go back into our particle view and add
in<00:06:40.490> a<00:06:40.580> collision<00:06:40.849> so<00:06:41.720> basically<00:06:42.169> this<00:06:42.410> is<00:06:42.590> just

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:42.620 
in a collision so basically this is just

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.310 
in a collision so basically this is just
an<00:06:42.860> event<00:06:43.220> I<00:06:43.400> drag<00:06:43.820> it<00:06:43.940> up<00:06:44.060> into<00:06:44.270> my<00:06:44.570> event<00:06:44.840> 1

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:45.320 
an event I drag it up into my event 1

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.939 
an event I drag it up into my event 1
and<00:06:46.000> I<00:06:47.000> have<00:06:47.389> the<00:06:47.900> list<00:06:48.169> of<00:06:48.289> deflectors<00:06:48.800> that

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:48.949 
and I have the list of deflectors that

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:49.810 
and I have the list of deflectors that
can<00:06:49.099> choose<00:06:49.310> from

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:49.820 
can choose from

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:54.580 
can choose from
and<00:06:49.910> I<00:06:50.780> pick<00:06:51.470> my<00:06:51.500> u<00:06:51.710> deflector<00:06:52.400> and<00:06:53.289> now<00:06:54.289> if<00:06:54.560> we

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:54.590 
and I pick my u deflector and now if we

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.260 
and I pick my u deflector and now if we
scrub<00:06:55.009> through<00:06:55.039> we<00:06:55.550> should<00:06:55.580> actually<00:06:55.880> see

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.270 
scrub through we should actually see

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.820 
scrub through we should actually see
this<00:06:56.449> working<00:06:57.430> so<00:06:58.430> as<00:06:58.550> you<00:06:58.669> see<00:06:58.910> it's<00:06:59.830> pushing

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:00.830 
this working so as you see it's pushing

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.830 
this working so as you see it's pushing
the<00:07:01.099> particles<00:07:01.550> off<00:07:04.300> now<00:07:05.300> we<00:07:05.419> got<00:07:05.570> a<00:07:05.599> couple

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:05.840 
the particles off now we got a couple

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.070 
the particles off now we got a couple
particles<00:07:06.380> that<00:07:06.530> are<00:07:06.650> stuck<00:07:06.860> in<00:07:07.039> there<00:07:07.220> that

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 
particles that are stuck in there that

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.930 
particles that are stuck in there that
are<00:07:09.080> not<00:07:09.380> moving<00:07:09.710> and<00:07:10.070> that's<00:07:10.159> because<00:07:10.639> this

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:10.940 
are not moving and that's because this

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.839 
are not moving and that's because this
box<00:07:11.380> that<00:07:12.380> frame<00:07:12.710> tin<00:07:13.039> maybe<00:07:13.340> needs<00:07:13.610> to<00:07:13.760> be

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:13.849 
box that frame tin maybe needs to be

00:07:13.849 --> 00:07:15.760 
box that frame tin maybe needs to be
over<00:07:14.090> just<00:07:14.120> a<00:07:14.419> slight<00:07:14.930> bit<00:07:15.199> more

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:15.770 
over just a slight bit more

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:19.060 
over just a slight bit more
so<00:07:16.760> we'll<00:07:16.909> just<00:07:17.030> correct<00:07:17.780> that<00:07:17.960> right<00:07:18.169> now<00:07:18.380> and

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:19.070 
so we'll just correct that right now and

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.409 
so we'll just correct that right now and
we'll<00:07:19.190> move<00:07:19.340> this<00:07:19.550> just<00:07:19.820> a<00:07:19.940> little<00:07:20.060> bit<00:07:20.270> this

00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:20.419 
we'll move this just a little bit this

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:24.070 
we'll move this just a little bit this
way<00:07:20.690> and<00:07:21.020> now<00:07:21.919> if<00:07:22.099> we<00:07:22.250> scrub<00:07:22.550> through<00:07:22.870> we<00:07:23.870> see

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.080 
way and now if we scrub through we see

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.010 
way and now if we scrub through we see
everything<00:07:24.349> is<00:07:24.620> moving
