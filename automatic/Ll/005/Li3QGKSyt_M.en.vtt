00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:09.480
 hello the viewer as promised express 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.469
 its constructive and about this 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:17.180
 Here are the silver things from Canon 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:20.160
 which name is canon powershot a2300 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.830
 full review will not do not see 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.960
 I’m going to talk about what we’re talking about 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.960
 I wonder whether it is possible or not 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.960
 use it as a camera for 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:37.640
 shooting blog posts or video reviews 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:40.370
 no matter what that means, consider 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.320
 whose main parameters can be judged 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.250
 the camera 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.809
 picture that is video video picture 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.930
 what she has for this is not for this 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.850
 there are 16 megapixel sensors 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.300
 it is used not all but nonetheless 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:59.150
 he has she has a lens very 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.879
 doubtful I honestly weakly catching up 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.710
 this marking that is there 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:07.310
 on this lens it says that 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:11.210
 focal length from 5 to 25 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:15.220
 millimeters how to understand this sorry not 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:18.140
 no no no not understand how can u 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.770
 dublin 25 millimeters same fish it 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.590
 this is something correct me if I'm wrong 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:29.350
 but something here smacks of some kind not 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:32.240
 I know stupid marketing okay drove 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:36.860
 how to take a picture picture takes 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:39.340
 the camera on the solid top three zire is not even 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.259
 despite the fact that now 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.570
 Well, that is, the past video was filmed at 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.570
 the same conditions the same two spotlights 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.390
 which pancake generally has power 1 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.700
 kilowatt 2 halogen vectors of 500 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.399
 watt and with all this extremely 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.950
 will deploy to use any mode 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.960
 for video maybe and i can but if 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.200
 honestly didn’t look I mean I trusted 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.500
 to shoot the machine as best he can see 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.609
 There are on such devices as a rule 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.220
 best result because you start 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:14.420
 delve make you worse in the end 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:18.200
 well troechka picture troechka autofocus 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.270
 autofocus it is it works when 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.320
 artificial lighting it works not 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:27.020
 very good again the same spotlight and 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.060
 Glare for autofocus is not very 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.460
 OK 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.800
 I have no softboxes therefore 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.960
 I do not know how it will work in the sun 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.480
 held her in his arms 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:41.260
 the older brother of this camera too 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.720
 powershot and the only thing is that instead of 2300 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.700
 there was tsiferka 4000 I do not know how much 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.540
 they are a friend of a friend and differ there with 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.850
 autofocus was all very good I him 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:56.980
 kept the camera on as if natural 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:03:00.590
 sun lighting the camera worked 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:04.090
 excellent for objects that 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:07.580
 were at a distance idiot don't know 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.160
 there may be up to ten centimeters class 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.020
 here this is not observed whether it is guilty 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.930
 in this coverage or blame for this 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.880
 the camera can not say yes to the word 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.050
 say the camera has 5 times 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.940
 optical zoom everything works all honest 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.100
 plus there is something else he has digital 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.710
 zoom but it is absolutely useless 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.850
 function 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:34.660
 further about sound recording here 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:38.000
 you can even put a solid four 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.770
 some big part I don’t know well 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.130
 saying sound like a barrel after all 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:48.170
 present but records very much 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:52.370
 tolerably say so without an external microphone 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:55.400
 5100 DSLR she records the sound 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:04:00.220
 worse well, as it were already nice though 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:03.620
 cameras stand but substantially in different ways 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:08.030
 The controls in this camera are simple. 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:11.300
 like a corner of the house at the top of the shutter button but 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.040
 sense of a button he of to start 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.830
 record video that is enough 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.200
 red button and further after 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.090
 confirmation autofocus video starts 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.350
 recorded with photos 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.600
 all about the same click on 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:29.000
 start and everything and the camera is ready to shoot 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:33.080
 cold start at the camera very well 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.919
 which is also nice as it pleases Well 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.710
 can still be said on this device 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:42.370
 yes, probably everything is a bad moment 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.050
 the fact that the internal memory does not have 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:49.669
 is it useful to know for video probably 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:52.610
 no but nevertheless as if to be honest 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.620
 long time did not spin soap dish in the hands but 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.050
 all those soap dishes that once were 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.360
 me in the distant past we all had 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.780
 built-in memory let it be not 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.300
 I know 50 megabytes but still somehow 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.539
 I do not know a little unpleasant can be 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:13.150
 trend trend fashion marketing don't know 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:15.830
 good or bad, too, will not judge 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.600
 on picking again how much 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.820
 This is important for shooting video not know 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.979
 she has very poor equipment 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.650
 standard here is such a mega 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:26.120
 tactical lanyard charger 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.250
 battery all 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.880
 she is a manual little book there some 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:35.330
 corr such memory disks in set 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:39.590
 Again, no, I don’t know at least 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:42.410
 some kind of gigabyte tag might 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:45.289
 it is very nice to put a penny 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:51.169
 it would get a complete kit exactly 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:53.180
 out of the box so well it seems like everything is well if 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:56.210
 to recap it again 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.009
 you can shoot the sound on it 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:02.430
 not good enough 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:04.590
 fountain but splashes fly picture 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:08.760
 Well, solid C grade again you can 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:10.100
 put such things here thanks for 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.570
 view bye 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:17.000
 still decided to try me like this 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:20.400
 miracle works that is ist lighting and 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.800
 found one interesting feature 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:28.290
 the fact that in the video mode autofocus works 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.510
 Well, does not work in general, not as it is 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.640
 independence of that 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:35.400
 halogens or sun out of the window 

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:38.580
 build that is here can not here 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:41.430
 he somehow and they even if semi descend 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:43.890
 how to do nothing that is 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:47.490
 I don't want to focus, but if 

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:51.210
 back to photo mode, everything works 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:53.490
 very good carnot here is a photo 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:56.190
 which was shot using the same 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:59.510
 from the same angle at which I 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:04.440
 tried to hang on the distance scale 

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:05.000
 on my favorite bells Soviet gay 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.060
 rusi 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.500
 Here is such an interesting thing to everyone else 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.500
 thanks again ways
