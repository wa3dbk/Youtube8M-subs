00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:07.649
 Hi everyone , Today's video I recorded 4 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.500
 hairstyles is inspired fighting and I love 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.990
 thunder's photos 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.820
 so that's why I decided to make this video 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.619
 and also involves other videos 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.380
 inspired in the field he here in the channel and 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.960
 I hope you like it. 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.090
 So that's it, it was very fast and it's okay. 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.740
 easy I hope you like 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:34.260
 come on then the first hairstyle I 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:36.480
 I'll start by dividing my hair in the middle and 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.460
 then I'll take one side and 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:44.820
 will start braiding 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:48.809
 I leave it embedded a couple of or three 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.090
 It moves neither and each side and then I 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.489
 I continue to make a normal child until 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.430
 the end and then I give a 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.910
 explosions - so on each wick to 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:05.489
 braiding gets wider does the same 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:10.470
 thing on the other side and then I go with 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:13.979
 clip clip it back and then I go 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.280
 pick up another wick and hide underneath 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.509
 the final infidel ending of her in france 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.509
 and also learn from grains 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:28.780
 to or if you want instead of holding 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:33.579
 with the clamp can pick up another elastic and 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:37.229
 join two braids then release the 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:37.229
 Rest of the child and leaves South 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.649
 second hairstyle I'm going to split the hair 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.299
 sideways and I'm going to start braiding 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.009
 well from the top of the head 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:00.149
 so I'll start braiding 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:02.310
 built-in normal only adding is a 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.149
 little hair in the house next door that 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.920
 I arrive 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.780
 so when you get a wick in the 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.310
 right side I add more hair 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.440
 when you arrive with a wick on the side 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.660
 left and I add more hair 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.810
 the built-in braid is a matter of practice 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.190
 because I did not know they did before but I 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:22.049
 I insisted and I was doing several tests 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:24.510
 myself and then I learned then I 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.519
 I'm going to make this braid built in after I 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.100
 I'll get it on the other side of the 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.000
 hair and will pull to continue 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.549
 braid 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.819
 When I get more or less there in the 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:40.080
 end of the ear or at the beginning of the neck 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:41.940
 I'll learn with elastic and then I 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.040
 I'll start making a braid spine 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.760
 from fish to fishbone is very easy 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.440
 it's just you add a wick 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.120
 from the right side to the left side and 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.900
 from the left side to the right side 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:58.590
 then I'll cut the elat out of what I had 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.459
 to separate the two braids and I'll 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.459
 give a start 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:08.329
 nor two braids to stay longer 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:11.150
 stripped and destroyed and the intention is 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.950
 really this being two braids of 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:19.159
 start with formal and end as 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:21.650
 Fishbone was the third hairstyle 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:24.200
 I'm going to roll my hair so I did 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.120
 curls with babyliss and I already have one 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.099
 video as I do with the boxes 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.340
 here on the channel and leave the link 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:34.010
 here below in the information box and 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.739
 after curling my hair I made the 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.889
 curls well stripped of me I go 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:44.900
 split your hair well and get a 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:47.090
 begin to make a built-in grace 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.219
 also taking back 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.849
 so I'll do the braiding and taking 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:51.849
 she behind 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:58.299
 I'll make it to the end and fasten with a 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.299
 elastic 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:09.379
 I 'll open the braid to let it go later. 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:11.420
 it is wider and has more volume and 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:13.610
 then I'll pull it all into a 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.130
 horse and fasten with a rubber band leaving 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.109
 france in evidence as my hair is 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:22.250
 dark could not see very well in the 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:25.900
 video to braid but it looks good 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:29.210
 looks pretty beautiful for the room and last 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:32.270
 hairstyle I'll separate the top 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.520
 and I will learn how elastic and 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.440
 I'll start braiding later. 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.300
 spine and fish here on youtube has 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.880
 several more detailed tutorials on how to 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.680
 make the customer leave but it's very simple 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.840
 on the unit is easier than a 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.199
 common child 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:51.020
 Then I learn with a rubber band and then 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:53.120
 very carefully I'll cut the 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:58.070
 first elastic from above with a 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:01.300
 scissors and I'll leave the braid over 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:03.770
 crush and I will open it to become more 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.289
 destroyed and that hairstyle was mine 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:09.099
 favorite and is very expensive and the campaign 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:09.099
 the sun 

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:19.059
