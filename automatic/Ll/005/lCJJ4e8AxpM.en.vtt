playstation 4 but the downside to it is
that<00:00:14.880> an<00:00:15.420> average<00:00:15.630> 4k<00:00:16.320> movie<00:00:16.650> download<00:00:17.010> would

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
that an average 4k movie download would

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.760 
that an average 4k movie download would
pull<00:00:17.580> down<00:00:17.789> 100<00:00:18.570> gigabytes<00:00:19.020> or<00:00:19.199> more<00:00:19.380> worth<00:00:19.590> of

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
pull down 100 gigabytes or more worth of

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.130 
pull down 100 gigabytes or more worth of
data<00:00:20.010> which<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:20.789> likely<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.330> mean<00:00:21.600> overnight

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
data which is likely to mean overnight

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.410 
data which is likely to mean overnight
downloading<00:00:22.830> now<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.580> just<00:00:23.939> think<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:24.390> a

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
downloading now I just think that is a

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.870 
downloading now I just think that is a
huge<00:00:24.930> inconvenience<00:00:25.529> for<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.400> lot<00:00:26.699> of

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
huge inconvenience for a lot of

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.560 
huge inconvenience for a lot of
customers<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:28.560> have<00:00:28.800> slow<00:00:29.699> broadband

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
customers and that have slow broadband

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.920 
customers and that have slow broadband
speeds<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:31.289> some<00:00:31.500> territories<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:33.420> don't

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
speeds and some territories and I don't

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.440 
speeds and some territories and I don't
think<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.200> will<00:00:34.320> be<00:00:34.469> everyone's<00:00:34.890> cup<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.280> tea

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
think it will be everyone's cup of tea

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.880 
think it will be everyone's cup of tea
initially<00:00:36.450> when<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.690> playstation<00:00:37.170> 4<00:00:37.410> slow<00:00:37.680> so

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
initially when the playstation 4 slow so

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.200 
initially when the playstation 4 slow so
i<00:00:37.920> just<00:00:38.100> think<00:00:38.309> about<00:00:38.399> solids<00:00:38.820> trying<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.120> do

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
i just think about solids trying to do

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.549 
i just think about solids trying to do
is<00:00:39.360> they<00:00:39.480> just<00:00:39.629> thinking<00:00:40.020> ahead<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.410> game

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
is they just thinking ahead of the game

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.799 
is they just thinking ahead of the game
I<00:00:40.829> had<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.430> time<00:00:41.790> like<00:00:42.300> they<00:00:42.450> did<00:00:42.600> with<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
I had a time like they did with the

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.110 
I had a time like they did with the
PlayStation<00:00:43.379> 3<00:00:43.649> on<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.280> PlayStation<00:00:44.879> 3

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
PlayStation 3 on the PlayStation 3

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.479 
PlayStation 3 on the PlayStation 3
launch<00:00:45.390> they<00:00:46.039> supported<00:00:47.039> hasty<00:00:47.610> TVs<00:00:48.440> by<00:00:49.489> by

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
launch they supported hasty TVs by by

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.510 
launch they supported hasty TVs by by
having<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.899> hdmi<00:00:52.469> port<00:00:52.739> on<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.949> playstation

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
having the hdmi port on the playstation

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.819 
having the hdmi port on the playstation
3<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.789> allowing<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.750> connection<00:00:55.170> between<00:00:55.199> HD

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
3 and allowing the connection between HD

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.670 
3 and allowing the connection between HD
tvs<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.940> playstation<00:00:57.449> 3<00:00:57.690> through<00:00:57.989> hdmi

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
tvs on the playstation 3 through hdmi

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.189 
tvs on the playstation 3 through hdmi
cable<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.910> i<00:00:59.940> think<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.480> 20-somethings

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
cable so i think the 20-somethings

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.250 
cable so i think the 20-somethings
similar<00:01:01.530> here<00:01:01.739> because<00:01:02.489> microsoft<00:01:03.260> didn't

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
similar here because microsoft didn't

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.100 
similar here because microsoft didn't
actually<00:01:04.769> support<00:01:05.430> HD<00:01:05.850> tvs<00:01:06.240> from<00:01:06.540> their

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
actually support HD tvs from their

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.240 
actually support HD tvs from their
launch<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.710> 360<00:01:08.570> and<00:01:09.570> they<00:01:10.470> only<00:01:10.650> recently

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
launch of the 360 and they only recently

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.210 
launch of the 360 and they only recently
got<00:01:11.490> into<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.909> by<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.450> lot<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.290> putting<00:01:13.590> hdmi

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
got into it by a lot of putting hdmi

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.640 
got into it by a lot of putting hdmi
port<00:01:14.520> on<00:01:14.670> there<00:01:15.000> later<00:01:15.360> version<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.049> 360

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
port on there later version of the 360

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.410 
port on there later version of the 360
so<00:01:17.159> i<00:01:17.220> think<00:01:17.280> sean<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.729> just<00:01:17.759> trying<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.180> think

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
so i think sean is just trying to think

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.700 
so i think sean is just trying to think
ahead<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.810> game<00:01:18.990> like<00:01:19.290> we<00:01:19.409> did<00:01:19.560> with<00:01:19.650> the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
ahead of the game like we did with the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.649 
ahead of the game like we did with the
playstation<00:01:20.280> 3<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.700> i<00:01:21.299> think<00:01:21.540> they're<00:01:21.630> just

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
playstation 3 and i think they're just

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.490 
playstation 3 and i think they're just
anticipate<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.439> fork<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:23.009> high<00:01:23.250> resolution<00:01:23.460> and

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
anticipate a fork a high resolution and

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.670 
anticipate a fork a high resolution and
picture<00:01:25.500> quality<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:26.040> be<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:27.259> huge<00:01:28.259> and

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
picture quality to be a huge and

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.499 
picture quality to be a huge and
movement<00:01:29.490> just<00:01:29.790> how<00:01:30.380> the<00:01:31.380> HDTV<00:01:32.220> was<00:01:32.610> back<00:01:33.060> a

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
movement just how the HDTV was back a

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.660 
movement just how the HDTV was back a
few<00:01:33.750> years<00:01:33.810> ago<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.590> i<00:01:34.799> just<00:01:35.280> think<00:01:35.460> it's<00:01:35.610> a

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
few years ago so i just think it's a

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.310 
few years ago so i just think it's a
strategic<00:01:36.240> being<00:01:36.479> from<00:01:36.689> Sony<00:01:36.960> on<00:01:37.140> their

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
strategic being from Sony on their

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.230 
strategic being from Sony on their
behalf<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.860> it's<00:01:38.549> not<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.759> bad<00:01:38.909> thing<00:01:39.060> that's

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
behalf and it's not a bad thing that's

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.010 
behalf and it's not a bad thing that's
all<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:40.340> they<00:01:41.340> go<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.880> was<00:01:41.970> my<00:01:42.090> video<00:01:42.360> just

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
all and they go that was my video just

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.990 
all and they go that was my video just
