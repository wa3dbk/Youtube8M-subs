00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 car model Muscovite 356 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.970
 manufacturer to guests not 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.900
 magazine series auto legends of the USSR 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.089
 This model comes under number 80 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:20.100
 is also a conceptual 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:23.060
 car or prototype too 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.490
 interesting model is made in this 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.760
 green 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.439
 Basically, this model is very color 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.920
 This machine is quite large if by 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.570
 size and can be compared with the Volga already 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.520
 not as small a class as basically 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.250
 from the heap were already quite large 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:46.800
 car is made very well is 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.469
 separate headlamps the headlight itself and 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:55.350
 turn signal they answers along with the grille 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:56.219
 chrome and glue them on top 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.449
 small such 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:04.710
 from transparent plastic like glass 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.840
 and when buying, note that 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.460
 some models may be this here itself 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.909
 plastinochka lost 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.580
 it is difficult to see it therefore to pay 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.659
 attention model also has a separate 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.630
 front bumper 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.549
 separate wipers this car is not 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.860
 has rearview mirrors 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.460
 but on the prototype they also did not have door 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.360
 pens 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:34.369
 moldings and small air of water it 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.909
 all vyshtampovka just painted 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.600
 rear lights 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.700
 performed on the principle as the front 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.600
 also made a plate 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.270
 chromed 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:50.009
 and pasted on top of it 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.890
 from transparent plastic this case he 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.810
 it is painted and besides such a block 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:00.180
 headlight has a separate rear bumper 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:05.729
 pretty simple wheels they are painted 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:07.170
 silver paint shod in a tire on 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.270
 I really like this model 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.360
 made tread but tires but also 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.550
 they will argue can he on the original 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:20.750
 the same was but not very somehow he 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.750
 It looks like this is not a luxury salon and 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.849
 yourself are these very conceptual models 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.930
 interesting poet because i'm generally here 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:34.500
 I see them for the first time not very fond of 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:38.940
 history of Muscovite but these models are very 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:43.530
 interesting that only you can and do not know 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:46.099
 and such machines existed very much 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.099
 simple bottom 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.730
 so who collects Muscovites 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.230
 for this price i think it's cheaper you donâ€™t 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:04.310
 here you will find such cars 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.310
 conceptual than for hotels
