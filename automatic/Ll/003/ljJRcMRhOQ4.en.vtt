00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.130

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.890
 in a new video so for a 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.410
 time not on minecraft but sharon on 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.240
 internet to show you so incited 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.189
 to create a minecraft server within this 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.570
 lot with I think is better 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.710
 maurane however plugin tablecloth all this 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.350
 that you want with dignity the surf 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.309
 deathnote and so this is late me 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:38.190
 so here is the very very reliable site that 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.929
 is your server will not ram I you 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.149
 promise so here's so starman it's a 

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:46.859
 French site that will write your know 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.539
 so here it is a little knowledge so he 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:51.690
 absolutely free but he welcomes 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:55.079
 also bigger and bigger server 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.149
 web for example a server with the state 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.309
 as many seconds but it's mostly the 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.749
 ramq and other so we'll go on 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.739
 their site to show you from the 

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:06.120
 first it works 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:09.060
 their style so after you take in 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.430
 first league he does not need to go 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.689
 so far this one 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.950
 underneath there is reported to have disappointed you 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.469
 do not go on this one though 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.180
 the universe stargate minecraft this litigation 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:24.210
 a title is completely different 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.009
 so we 're already doing pretty well 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.130
 did it even here it's the mom that's fine 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:33.149
 scroll through these challenges the back some sense 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.430
 but with threads so to go so 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:38.280
 full rhythm highlighted everything that 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.149
 you can have that I will present 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.969
 a little bit so that's it that's the 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.280
 free version so years during us 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:49.530
 allow our ten meters per second 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.499
 server addresses they your ideas 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.469
 dedicated so there you put your address 

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:57.869
 mail to the house was nothing to 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:00.270
 combined that we then draw the address 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.909
 from your simple your name your card 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.899
 you consider it's even our way of 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:10.740
 game other type of terrain so standard 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:13.740
 pavano then that here you agree to be 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.780
 acquired here we do not accept them and 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.280
 it's the nickname during the night by 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.140
 example if your home is 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.050
 in the usa land is a spa reasons 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.720
 possible and so your dough for it 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.769
 normal scenographer mccarter of the worlds 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.060
 thank 4,48 and all that is just going to know 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:37.049
 not really what it is and after the holidays 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:42.560
 orders and so I presented the 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:46.860
 other there the other offers and offers 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.780
 so so there really not put everything 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:55.890
 we want because I feel but it 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:03:01.049
 pissed off but hey we won 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:06.030
 so that's the same thing until you can 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:08.310
 pay me the parking meter and disk space 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.040
 really everything increases and it's the same 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.190
 something that seems unlikely for 12 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.069
 month study frankly here we can 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.010
 have a good waiter that for twenty three 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:24.180
 hours and 23 hours a good waiter who 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.620
 turn out well so here you are so the 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.239
 crapule very surprising if he is more 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.109
 a utopia sound it's thirty eight 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:34.739
 months ago so after there is the version 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:36.750
 after the handle off it is 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.049
 really poor must start doing 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.870
 a humble man will therefore still not serve 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:46.200
 so need the same thing there so there 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.569
 look good we are chara such 50 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.099
 euros super reliable samar i would think 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:53.579
 not perfectly 20 people on it 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:58.230
 even if the cac who can not have peace 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:04:00.450
 dedicated his mother came to dispute a 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.849
 little bit as if we see there against 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.630
 on metals thoroughly because we can have 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:09.780
 for a lot to sleep in is not that 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:12.720
 it's not supplements and finally 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:18.209
 hockey as usual the object of all 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:22.550
 widgets and 1.1 last month 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:27.970
 latest offers this one so the xx is 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:31.330
 more and more memory for that 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:36.090
 your skin we can have for 160 euros 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:40.030
 on the other hand still heavy secret until 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:46.960

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:49.750

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:57.520
 but that's just money one of the 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:00.160
 best to start again - 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.070
 translated us wide for a little knowledge 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.020
