brown well it's dark it has a lot of

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.639 
brown well it's dark it has a lot of
translucency<00:00:45.420> what<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.110> means<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.620> that

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
translucency what that means is that

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.830 
translucency what that means is that
it's<00:00:46.980> sort<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.660> semi-transparent<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.719> can

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
it's sort of semi-transparent you can

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.420 
it's sort of semi-transparent you can
actually<00:00:48.960> see<00:00:49.320> through<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.710> if<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.219> leave

crimson as you can see here there's a
section<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.610> combination<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.600> two

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:22.130 
colors and I'm just gonna blend those
two<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:17.869> just<00:01:18.869> like<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:20.270> in<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.479> same<00:01:21.750> motion

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
two in just like that in the same motion

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.080 
two in just like that in the same motion
that<00:01:22.860> I've<00:01:22.979> been<00:01:23.130> doing<00:01:23.460> everything<00:01:23.700> which<00:01:23.970> is

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
that I've been doing everything which is

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.230 
that I've been doing everything which is
a<00:01:24.119> 45-degree<00:01:24.960> angle<00:01:24.990> from<00:01:25.350> left<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.740> right<00:01:26.240> and

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
a 45-degree angle from left to right and

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.780 
a 45-degree angle from left to right and
all<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.810> sudden<00:01:27.840> I'm<00:01:28.560> beginning<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.310> see

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
all of a sudden I'm beginning to see

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.249 
all of a sudden I'm beginning to see
that<00:01:30.210> there<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.979> some<00:01:31.979> kind<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:33.259> shape

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
that there is some kind of shape

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.499 
that there is some kind of shape
evolving<00:01:35.159> because<00:01:35.430> I'm<00:01:35.549> basically<00:01:35.700> blending

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
evolving because I'm basically blending

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.359 
evolving because I'm basically blending
the<00:01:36.630> two<00:01:36.659> colors<00:01:37.140> together<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.829> smoothing

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
the two colors together and smoothing

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.899 
the two colors together and smoothing
them<00:01:38.430> out<00:01:42.770> I'm<00:01:43.770> not<00:01:44.070> putting<00:01:44.369> any<00:01:44.490> light<00:01:44.729> on

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
them out I'm not putting any light on

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.170 
them out I'm not putting any light on
