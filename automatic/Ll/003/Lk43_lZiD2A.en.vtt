00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:11.759
 easy ear well what do you dig 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.610

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:22.710
 leave you know better I'm just looking like a snake 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.550

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.349
 what do we need 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:31.740

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:51.680
 we put here signs and on the 3rd floor it 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:55.079
 good to do on the north series though 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.710
 first amongst anything to avoid because 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:03.920
 a meter here we leave a place here 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:07.030
 digging down to 2 blocks here width 3 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:11.909

 it is sticky and simple either 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.360
 Well, here we set up a repeater and Igno 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.759
 be and put the block so it should be 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:33.430
 what if you put here not yet 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:35.920
 will work there is how you dig and draw 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:40.600
 attention here is even pump 1 for this 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:45.700
 lines should one block stay here 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:48.369
