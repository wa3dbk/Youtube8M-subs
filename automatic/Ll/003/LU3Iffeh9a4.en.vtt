got a couple of items from their own one

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.629 
got a couple of items from their own one
of<00:00:10.710> which<00:00:10.950> is<00:00:11.250> this<00:00:11.639> pair<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:12.000> jeans<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:13.639> these

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.859 
were just 498 but they are actually Earl
jeans<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:23.060> I'm<00:00:24.060> thinking<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.600> thrift<00:00:24.840> store

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
jeans and I'm thinking the thrift store

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.450 
jeans and I'm thinking the thrift store
was<00:00:25.109> not<00:00:25.230> familiar<00:00:25.680> with<00:00:25.800> this<00:00:25.920> brand<00:00:26.220> because

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
was not familiar with this brand because

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.140 
was not familiar with this brand because
they<00:00:26.730> price<00:00:26.970> them<00:00:27.269> sort<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:27.900> low<00:00:28.910> but<00:00:29.910> this<00:00:30.000> is

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
they price them sort of low but this is

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.340 
they price them sort of low but this is
actually<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:31.340> pretty<00:00:32.340> expensive<00:00:32.930> jeans<00:00:33.930> brand

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
actually a pretty expensive jeans brand

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.729 
actually a pretty expensive jeans brand
so<00:00:35.250> I've<00:00:35.579> actually<00:00:35.820> never<00:00:36.090> owned<00:00:36.450> any<00:00:36.870> of

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.059 
were also I couldn't try them on and
they<00:02:06.540> ended<00:02:06.689> up<00:02:06.810> being<00:02:07.020> too<00:02:07.200> tight<00:02:07.409> but<00:02:07.950> they

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
they ended up being too tight but they

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.980 
they ended up being too tight but they
were<00:02:08.129> size<00:02:08.369> 24<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.780> can

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
were size 24 and you can

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.670

see<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.320> these<00:02:10.470> are<00:02:10.740> size<00:02:11.040> 25<00:02:12.500> so<00:02:13.500> I<00:02:13.530> thought

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
see that these are size 25 so I thought

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.070 
see that these are size 25 so I thought
that<00:02:13.830> these<00:02:13.920> might<00:02:14.130> actually<00:02:14.310> fit<00:02:14.850> but<00:02:15.330> um<00:02:15.600> I

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
that these might actually fit but um I

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.140 
that these might actually fit but um I
was<00:02:17.040> able<00:02:17.100> to<00:02:17.280> sell<00:02:17.460> the<00:02:17.550> pair<00:02:17.730> that<00:02:17.880> didn't
