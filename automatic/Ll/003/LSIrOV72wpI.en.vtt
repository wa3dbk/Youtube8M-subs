00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.540
 yes 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.730
 i 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.020
 Now I am legend and nothing of the call of duty 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.140
 ghosts 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.850
 I 'm going to talk about my impressions 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.560
 some things are so controversial and 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:31.430
 other things that seem pretty good to me 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.410
 and I think the games to be 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.260
 100% competitive than some do 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.670
 changes to see what happens and about the 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.910
 changes keeps talking along the 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.910
 video 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.980
 the advantages in this game after 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.989
 the innovation that black ops 2 had 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.210
 to be able to make to have points for 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.680
 that the classes can put you different 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.420
 things do not always put the same 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.020
 this game have wanted to do the same 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:03.500
 they have innovated a little more and have put what 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.230
 you had 8 points to create all 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.820
 your own advantage each one has 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:14.810
 different points this is new in this 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.230
 game is innovated and you can get up to 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.630
 8 or expose yourself 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.520
 all of a point if you want three 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.880
 It depends on our each one to make 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.250
 that every day is taking out new things 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.590
 new combinations and the truth is that 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.360
 this is pretty good the weapons of 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:36.560
 this game I put it I could see is that 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.560
 the long guns 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:43.070
 they have very little recoil 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.380
 you mean that it moves very very little 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.780
 the look compared to the previous 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.579
 game that we have been playing the black ops 2 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.259
 in this game you will see much more 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:56.899
 happy is how it happened in new to far 3 and 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:02:01.429
 there is a rafa weapon that is very very 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:04.070
 powerful is this the mss and then the 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:07.039
 rx 160 what i'm going to try on every 12 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.509
 the truth is that I also see her weapons 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:13.260
 strong for the competition these 3 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.690
 and on his rifles he could try the 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.710
 mink in cvg 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.640
 and the cassette 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:24.510
 7 is a bit strange soul because 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.370
 It carries integrated muffler is something 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.130
 new in this game that some souls 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.130
 this well integrated and the laser mine or 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:38.020
 silencer is quite strong just like 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:42.160
 the mink and sbg not low ss when the 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:46.110
 bits is the amount that they tested in the 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.090
 presentation of the game in Germany 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.490
 It is a fire that has had a lot of controversy 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.770
 because you do not know if it's going to be 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.290
 competitive or not by the mere fact of 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.620
 what 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.239
 it's a little 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.860
 how to play baseball but in the call of 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.830
 duty 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.630
 you have nothing more enemy and enter 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.690
 as a kind of portal 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.520
 what does it do when you enter the 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.570
 portal twice is a point you do not have 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.290
 what to expect nothing you have to enter 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.880
 You can directly enter in front of 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.210
 all rival equipment and get in there without you 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.210
 they see you 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.180
 Y 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.900
 about what has been commented these days 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:33.920
 that they have that competition could 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.920
 do the 55 after trying it some 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:40.170
 players from america have seen that the 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.970
 maps are too big 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.620
 this can be seen that it is very large 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.990
 they have obstacles 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.630
 they have seen what 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.670
 that can be fine 5 to 5 for the 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.970
 theme that the map is very big other 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.580
 for 4 same it becomes very very boring 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:01.680
 surely do not try and you will see what 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.680
 happens when the game is more advanced 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:09.069
 in the previous one with white 2 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:11.319
 felt the streak of points in 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:14.470
 this game is already known to be gusts of 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.480
 low 9 times of points the difference of 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.670
 this game is that the streaks you can 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.910
 get 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:23.370
 by gusts of casualties the more 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.910
 more dull then get that what 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.570
 encourages people to be more stopped 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.890
 you can not so much do not go so much to 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.480
 load and then you can do the game 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.720
 much more passive in the other was very 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.190
 different because to get you a streak 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.050
 you had to charge many points 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.450
 we have to enter it was easier to get you out 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:47.130
 a streak within a goal that 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:49.380
 out and I do not know how this was not the truth 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.060
 I do not know what they are going to do but from my 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.310
 point of view to have the gusts of 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.090
 losses in this game would be a mistake 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.090
 quite serious
