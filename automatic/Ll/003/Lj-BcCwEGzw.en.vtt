spigen for the galaxy s6 edge now I've
seen<00:00:09.000> some<00:00:09.660> people<00:00:09.929> online<00:00:10.080> have<00:00:10.469> some

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
seen some people online have some

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.039 
seen some people online have some
skepticism<00:00:11.340> on<00:00:11.460> how<00:00:11.730> you<00:00:12.240> could<00:00:12.450> put<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.750> screen

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
skepticism on how you could put a screen

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.110 
skepticism on how you could put a screen
protector<00:00:13.230> or<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.740> case<00:00:14.099> on<00:00:14.340> this<00:00:14.580> duel<00:00:14.820> curved

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
protector or a case on this duel curved

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.300 
protector or a case on this duel curved
display<00:00:15.570> and<00:00:15.809> how<00:00:16.320> it<00:00:16.470> might<00:00:16.590> cover<00:00:16.949> and

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
display and how it might cover and

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.370 
display and how it might cover and
protect<00:00:17.699> your<00:00:18.060> device<00:00:18.180> so<00:00:18.690> hopefully<00:00:19.140> today<00:00:19.289> I

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
protect your device so hopefully today I

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.560 
protect your device so hopefully today I
can<00:00:19.470> have<00:00:19.740> some<00:00:19.920> answers<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:21.000> your<00:00:21.119> questions

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
on what it might be like to throw a case

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.250 
on what it might be like to throw a case
or<00:00:23.670> screen<00:00:23.760> protector<00:00:24.269> on<00:00:24.420> it<00:00:24.449> so<00:00:24.960> let's<00:00:25.140> get

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
or screen protector on it so let's get

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.410 
or screen protector on it so let's get
into<00:00:25.320> it

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:32.420 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.090 

okay<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.750> two<00:00:33.870> cases<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.380> have<00:00:34.410> today<00:00:34.710> again

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
okay so the two cases I have today again

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.979 
okay so the two cases I have today again
they're<00:00:35.280> both<00:00:35.430> from<00:00:35.579> speaking<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.239> have<00:00:36.780> the

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
they're both from speaking I have the

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.310 
they're both from speaking I have the
Neo<00:00:37.470> Hybrid<00:00:37.590> for<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.460> s6<00:00:38.879> edge<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.570> this

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
Neo Hybrid for the s6 edge and this

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.530 
Neo Hybrid for the s6 edge and this
doesn't<00:00:40.559> have<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.829> specific<00:00:41.309> name<00:00:41.790> on<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.300> but

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
doesn't have a specific name on it but

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.780 
doesn't have a specific name on it but
it<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.840> bumper<00:00:43.410> case<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.920> i'm<00:00:44.520> putting<00:00:44.730> that

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:44.790 
it is a bumper case and i'm putting that

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.720 
it is a bumper case and i'm putting that
again<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.180> quotes<00:00:45.449> because<00:00:45.710> it<00:00:46.710> spent<00:00:47.640> you

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
again in quotes because it spent you

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.820 
again in quotes because it spent you
know<00:00:47.760> they<00:00:48.120> kind<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.510> focus<00:00:49.140> on<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.470> bumper

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
know they kind of focus on the bumper

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.310 
know they kind of focus on the bumper
here<00:00:50.309> with<00:00:50.519> the<00:00:50.730> rubber<00:00:51.030> design<00:00:51.420> but<00:00:51.720> there<00:00:52.170> is

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
here with the rubber design but there is

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.350 
here with the rubber design but there is
a<00:00:52.350> clear<00:00:52.949> plastic<00:00:53.309> back<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.970> it<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.120> it's<00:00:54.239> not<00:00:54.300> a

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
a clear plastic back to it so it's not a

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.720 
a clear plastic back to it so it's not a
true<00:00:54.629> bumper<00:00:54.960> your<00:00:55.110> back<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.440> not<00:00:55.620> exposed<00:00:56.070> but

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
true bumper your back is not exposed but

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.400 
true bumper your back is not exposed but
in<00:00:56.820> this<00:00:56.910> case<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.360> actually<00:00:57.510> do<00:00:57.930> want<00:00:58.140> that

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
in this case I actually do want that

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.649 
in this case I actually do want that
because<00:00:58.620> again<00:00:59.129> like<00:00:59.400> I<00:00:59.489> mentioned<00:00:59.519> it<00:01:00.059> is

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:00.659 
because again like I mentioned it is

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:02.390 
because again like I mentioned it is
covered<00:01:01.050> in<00:01:01.140> glass<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.829> whole<00:01:01.949> device<00:01:02.220> is

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
covered in glass so the whole device is

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.910 
covered in glass so the whole device is
susceptible<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:03.059> scratches<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.750> cracks<00:01:03.890> so<00:01:04.890> I

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
susceptible to scratches and cracks so I

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.490 
susceptible to scratches and cracks so I
do<00:01:05.070> want<00:01:05.759> the<00:01:06.180> protection<00:01:06.810> on<00:01:06.899> the<00:01:06.990> back<00:01:07.170> but

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
do want the protection on the back but

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.870 
do want the protection on the back but
it's<00:01:07.619> clear<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.160> kind<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.490> don't<00:01:08.640> lose

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
it's clear so you kind of don't lose

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.540 
it's clear so you kind of don't lose
design<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.690> the<00:01:09.720> color<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.619> whatever<00:01:11.009> device

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
design and the color of whatever device

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.060 
design and the color of whatever device
you<00:01:11.729> have<00:01:11.759> now<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.090> have<00:01:12.300> the<00:01:12.450> sapphire<00:01:13.070> black

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
you have now I have the sapphire black

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.620 
you have now I have the sapphire black
but<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.700> right<00:01:14.880> sunlight<00:01:15.300> it<00:01:15.420> kind<00:01:15.570> of

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
but in the right sunlight it kind of

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.420 
but in the right sunlight it kind of
looks<00:01:15.810> blue<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.440> kind<00:01:16.649> of<00:01:16.680> like<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.070> so

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
looks blue and I kind of like that so

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.820 
looks blue and I kind of like that so
this<00:01:17.970> won't<00:01:18.180> take<00:01:18.300> that<00:01:18.479> away<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:19.440> let's<00:01:19.680> go

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
this won't take that away so let's go

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.710 
this won't take that away so let's go
ahead<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.130> get<00:01:20.430> into<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:21.060> one<00:01:21.270> first<00:01:21.509> this

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
ahead and get into this one first this

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:30.260 
ahead and get into this one first this
is<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.960> Neo<00:01:22.170> Hybrid<00:01:28.460> so<00:01:29.460> what<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.789> is<00:01:29.850> is

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
is the Neo Hybrid so what this is is

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.960 
is the Neo Hybrid so what this is is
it's<00:01:30.600> basically<00:01:30.750> just<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.560> rubber<00:01:31.770> case<00:01:32.580> got

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
it's basically just a rubber case got

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.340 
it's basically just a rubber case got
nice<00:01:33.179> little<00:01:33.420> texture<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.899> it<00:01:33.929> on<00:01:34.080> the<00:01:34.200> inside

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
nice little texture to it on the inside

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.770 
nice little texture to it on the inside
and<00:01:34.950> it's<00:01:35.429> rubber<00:01:35.700> on<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.000> outside<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:36.660> it

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
and it's rubber on the outside so it

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.880 
and it's rubber on the outside so it
won't<00:01:37.020> slide<00:01:37.740> rule<00:01:38.130> easily<00:01:38.610> but<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:40.289> has<00:01:40.500> kind

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
won't slide rule easily but it has kind

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.669 
won't slide rule easily but it has kind
of<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.130> fake<00:01:41.700> looking<00:01:42.300> metal<00:01:42.750> just<00:01:43.319> a<00:01:43.410> harder

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679 
of a fake looking metal just a harder

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:46.880 
of a fake looking metal just a harder
plastic<00:01:43.940> bumper<00:01:44.940> around<00:01:45.330> it<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.410> you<00:01:46.590> can

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
plastic bumper around it so that you can

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.210 
plastic bumper around it so that you can
have<00:01:47.459> a<00:01:47.489> little<00:01:47.759> bit<00:01:47.910> of<00:01:47.940> extra<00:01:48.830> comfort<00:01:49.830> when

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
have a little bit of extra comfort when

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.639 
have a little bit of extra comfort when
you're<00:01:50.250> holding<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.910> and<00:01:51.080> it<00:01:52.080> kind<00:01:52.319> of<00:01:52.349> helps

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
you're holding it and it kind of helps

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.499

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
in my unboxing that the phone is

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.699 
in my unboxing that the phone is
actually<00:02:20.879> pretty<00:02:21.209> sharp<00:02:22.020> when<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:22.290> hold<00:02:22.530> it

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
actually pretty sharp when you hold it

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.190 
actually pretty sharp when you hold it
the<00:02:22.739> edges<00:02:23.190> are<00:02:23.310> kind<00:02:23.550> of<00:02:23.640> sharp<00:02:23.849> and<00:02:24.270> I<00:02:24.930> didn't

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
the edges are kind of sharp and I didn't

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.809 
the edges are kind of sharp and I didn't
know<00:02:25.260> how<00:02:25.290> I<00:02:25.470> would<00:02:25.620> like<00:02:25.950> that<00:02:25.980> at<00:02:26.250> first<00:02:26.280> and

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
know how I would like that at first and

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.309 
know how I would like that at first and
I<00:02:27.060> kind<00:02:27.270> of<00:02:27.300> got<00:02:27.450> used<00:02:27.629> to<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.020> it's<00:02:28.170> not

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
I kind of got used to it and it's not

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.860 
I kind of got used to it and it's not
too<00:02:28.470> bad<00:02:28.650> but<00:02:28.680> this<00:02:29.069> really<00:02:29.550> helps<00:02:30.030> get<00:02:30.599> a<00:02:30.629> nice

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
too bad but this really helps get a nice

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.710 
too bad but this really helps get a nice
grip<00:02:31.170> on<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.410> phone<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.540> know<00:02:33.660> it

doesn't cover the edge there and that's

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.240 
doesn't cover the edge there and that's
on<00:02:36.810> purpose<00:02:37.140> obviously<00:02:37.739> you<00:02:37.860> want<00:02:38.069> to<00:02:38.129> be<00:02:38.190> able

not touching it not even the edge part
everything<00:02:51.300> is<00:02:51.480> lifted<00:02:51.990> off<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.260> ground<00:02:52.290> now

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
everything is lifted off the ground now

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.790

if<00:02:52.860> you<00:02:53.010> were<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.160> drop<00:02:53.459> it<00:02:53.670> face<00:02:53.910> down<00:02:53.940> if<00:02:54.800> you

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
if you were to drop it face down if you

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.190 
if you were to drop it face down if you
drop<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.130> on<00:02:56.190> concrete<00:02:56.840> chances<00:02:57.840> are<00:02:57.990> there's

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
drop it on concrete chances are there's

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.750 
drop it on concrete chances are there's
going<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.410> be<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:58.560> little<00:02:58.680> rock<00:02:59.010> or<00:02:59.310> some<00:02:59.550> raised

going to be a little rock or some raised

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.000 
going to be a little rock or some raised
edges<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.390> that<00:03:00.450> will<00:03:00.810> catch<00:03:01.110> it<00:03:01.140> so<00:03:01.800> this

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
edges and that will catch it so this

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.949 
edges and that will catch it so this
isn't<00:03:02.310> drop<00:03:02.550> proof<00:03:02.850> no<00:03:03.120> case<00:03:03.360> will<00:03:03.630> unless<00:03:03.810> you

I'm going to snap the case on here this
is<00:04:44.080> a<00:04:44.110> nice<00:04:44.320> case<00:04:44.560> too<00:04:44.910> there<00:04:45.910> is<00:04:46.030> no<00:04:47.700> just<00:04:48.700> make

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
is a nice case too there is no just make

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.700 
is a nice case too there is no just make
sure<00:04:49.030> it's<00:04:49.180> snap<00:04:49.360> down<00:04:49.540> there<00:04:49.720> there<00:04:50.410> are<00:04:50.530> no

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.580 
sure it's snap down there there are no
buttons<00:04:51.040> so<00:04:51.790> it's<00:04:52.120> kind<00:04:52.510> of<00:04:52.660> hard<00:04:53.070> for<00:04:54.070> me<00:04:54.130> to

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
buttons so it's kind of hard for me to

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.540 
buttons so it's kind of hard for me to
differentiate<00:04:56.590> where<00:04:56.920> the<00:04:57.100> buttons<00:04:57.400> are

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
differentiate where the buttons are

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.030 
differentiate where the buttons are
actually<00:04:58.030> at<00:04:58.240> so<00:04:59.230> that's<00:04:59.440> going<00:04:59.710> to<00:04:59.830> be<00:04:59.920> a

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
actually at so that's going to be a

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.910 
actually at so that's going to be a
bummer<00:05:00.330> you<00:05:01.330> really<00:05:01.810> don't<00:05:02.050> know<00:05:02.290> at<00:05:02.860> all

it's not really a button just kind of an
indent<00:05:24.370> it's<00:05:24.520> really<00:05:25.030> hard<00:05:25.270> to<00:05:25.420> tell<00:05:25.830> you<00:05:26.830> have

indent it's really hard to tell you have
your<00:05:27.100> cutouts<00:05:27.490> for<00:05:27.730> your<00:05:28.030> 3.5<00:05:28.720> millimeter

down<00:05:43.540> again<00:05:44.320> it's<00:05:44.500> very<00:05:44.560> hard<00:05:45.100> this<00:05:45.190> is

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
down again it's very hard this is

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.530 
down again it's very hard this is
probably<00:05:45.520> the<00:05:45.730> hardest<00:05:45.760> one<00:05:46.180> when<00:05:46.330> you're<00:05:46.450> not

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.540 
probably the hardest one when you're not

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.330 
probably the hardest one when you're not
looking<00:05:47.020> you<00:05:47.590> don't<00:05:47.740> you're<00:05:47.980> clicking<00:05:48.160> a

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
looking you don't you're clicking a

looking you don't you're clicking a
button<00:05:48.370> you<00:05:48.850> don't<00:05:49.060> really<00:05:49.270> know<00:05:49.510> which<00:05:49.720> one

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
button you don't really know which one

button you don't really know which one
you're<00:05:50.230> clicking<00:05:50.470> so<00:05:51.480> kind<00:05:52.480> of<00:05:52.540> have<00:05:52.660> to<00:05:52.690> use

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
you're clicking so kind of have to use

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.780 
you're clicking so kind of have to use
your<00:05:53.050> best<00:05:53.230> judgment<00:05:53.650> there<00:05:53.800> and<00:05:54.010> on<00:05:54.460> the<00:05:54.580> top

you have your cutouts for your necessary
ports<00:05:57.850> up<00:05:58.000> here<00:05:58.330> and<00:05:58.510> your<00:05:58.930> microphone<00:06:00.240> also

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.660 
ports up here and your microphone also
you<00:06:01.300> have<00:06:01.540> a<00:06:01.570> cutout<00:06:01.840> in<00:06:02.050> the<00:06:02.080> back<00:06:02.340> for<00:06:03.340> your

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:03.670 
you have a cutout in the back for your

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:08.130 
you have a cutout in the back for your
heart<00:06:04.300> rate<00:06:04.480> monitor<00:06:05.020> and<00:06:05.290> your<00:06:06.090> camera<00:06:07.140> but

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:08.140 
heart rate monitor and your camera but

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.610 
heart rate monitor and your camera but
it's<00:06:08.590> clear<00:06:09.070> you<00:06:09.430> know<00:06:09.520> you<00:06:09.610> can<00:06:10.320> see<00:06:11.320> through

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
it's clear you know you can see through

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.130 
it's clear you know you can see through
it<00:06:11.650> it's<00:06:11.890> got<00:06:12.010> just<00:06:12.430> a<00:06:12.550> nice<00:06:12.730> matte<00:06:13.390> kind<00:06:14.050> of

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:14.140 
it it's got just a nice matte kind of

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.000 
it it's got just a nice matte kind of
finish<00:06:14.440> to<00:06:14.650> it<00:06:14.680> I<00:06:14.980> actually<00:06:16.110> the<00:06:17.110> feel<00:06:17.380> is<00:06:17.560> okay

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
finish to it I actually the feel is okay

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.250 
finish to it I actually the feel is okay
but<00:06:18.070> this<00:06:18.310> is<00:06:18.490> more<00:06:18.670> sharp<00:06:19.090> than<00:06:19.660> the<00:06:20.050> Neo

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:20.260 
but this is more sharp than the Neo

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.870 
but this is more sharp than the Neo
Hybrid<00:06:20.350> that's<00:06:20.920> probably<00:06:21.250> the<00:06:21.430> best<00:06:21.610> one<00:06:21.820> out

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 
Hybrid that's probably the best one out

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.120 
Hybrid that's probably the best one out
of<00:06:22.030> the<00:06:22.180> two<00:06:22.360> let<00:06:23.140> me<00:06:23.230> bring<00:06:23.440> that<00:06:23.650> case<00:06:23.860> back

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.130 
of the two let me bring that case back

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:27.600 
of the two let me bring that case back
into<00:06:24.430> there<00:06:25.320> this<00:06:26.320> is<00:06:26.530> kind<00:06:26.830> of<00:06:26.920> the<00:06:27.130> more<00:06:27.340> for

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 
into there this is kind of the more for

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.370 
into there this is kind of the more for
solid<00:06:27.910> feel<00:06:28.090> in<00:06:28.240> the<00:06:28.300> hand<00:06:28.330> and<00:06:28.750> it's<00:06:28.930> rounded

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:29.380 
solid feel in the hand and it's rounded

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.320 
solid feel in the hand and it's rounded
so<00:06:29.620> it<00:06:29.680> doesn't<00:06:29.950> feel<00:06:30.070> sharp<00:06:30.430> this<00:06:30.970> is<00:06:31.150> super

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330 
so it doesn't feel sharp this is super

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.570 
so it doesn't feel sharp this is super
thin<00:06:31.810> so<00:06:32.050> you're<00:06:32.560> going<00:06:32.680> to<00:06:32.740> get<00:06:32.890> away<00:06:33.010> with<00:06:33.130> a

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:33.580 
thin so you're going to get away with a

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.120 
thin so you're going to get away with a
little<00:06:34.030> bit<00:06:34.180> of<00:06:34.210> a<00:06:34.360> thinner<00:06:34.630> case<00:06:34.960> to<00:06:35.230> it<00:06:35.350> so

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:36.130 
little bit of a thinner case to it so

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.790 
little bit of a thinner case to it so
yeah<00:06:36.280> it's<00:06:36.460> a<00:06:36.550> thinner<00:06:36.790> case<00:06:37.120> not<00:06:38.050> by<00:06:38.230> much<00:06:38.470> but

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
yeah it's a thinner case not by much but

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.310 
yeah it's a thinner case not by much but
I'm<00:06:39.760> not<00:06:40.000> it's<00:06:40.330> really<00:06:40.480> hard<00:06:40.720> to<00:06:40.780> describe<00:06:41.080> how

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:41.320 
I'm not it's really hard to describe how

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.260 
I'm not it's really hard to describe how
this<00:06:41.530> feels<00:06:41.770> but<00:06:42.130> this<00:06:42.580> one<00:06:42.820> the<00:06:43.000> Neo<00:06:43.180> Hybrid

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.270 
this feels but this one the Neo Hybrid

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.450 
this feels but this one the Neo Hybrid
definitely<00:06:43.990> feels<00:06:44.170> better<00:06:44.440> than<00:06:45.040> the<00:06:45.130> bumper

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:45.460 
definitely feels better than the bumper

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.100 
definitely feels better than the bumper
so<00:06:45.640> if<00:06:45.760> you<00:06:45.880> have<00:06:46.030> twenty<00:06:46.390> dollars<00:06:46.690> to<00:06:46.840> spend

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.110 
so if you have twenty dollars to spend

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.170 
so if you have twenty dollars to spend
or<00:06:47.410> a<00:06:47.440> little<00:06:47.560> bit<00:06:47.740> less<00:06:47.920> than<00:06:48.550> that<00:06:48.790> I<00:06:49.060> think

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.180 
or a little bit less than that I think

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.470 
or a little bit less than that I think
it's<00:06:49.420> about<00:06:49.570> 17<00:06:50.140> and<00:06:50.500> 12<00:06:50.800> I<00:06:51.760> would<00:06:52.120> go<00:06:52.270> with

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:52.480 
it's about 17 and 12 I would go with

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.670 
it's about 17 and 12 I would go with
this<00:06:52.660> one<00:06:52.900> this<00:06:52.990> one<00:06:53.170> might<00:06:53.290> be<00:06:53.320> the<00:06:53.500> more

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 
this one this one might be the more

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.920 
this one this one might be the more
expensive<00:06:53.920> one<00:06:54.250> too<00:06:54.390> but<00:06:55.390> you're<00:06:55.720> definitely

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:55.930 
expensive one too but you're definitely

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.960 
expensive one too but you're definitely
getting<00:06:56.230> a<00:06:56.440> better<00:06:56.590> feel<00:06:56.950> and<00:06:57.190> a<00:06:57.760> better

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:57.970 
getting a better feel and a better

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:59.580 
getting a better feel and a better
protection<00:06:58.570> for<00:06:58.690> your<00:06:58.720> phone<00:06:58.930> in<00:06:59.050> my<00:06:59.230> opinion

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:08.770 
found a better case for the s6 edge that
