especially<00:00:07.890> when<00:00:08.040> you<00:00:08.160> get<00:00:08.309> them<00:00:08.519> stuck<00:00:09.090> at

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
especially when you get them stuck at

especially when you get them stuck at
the<00:00:09.510> a<00:00:09.540> spawn<00:00:10.110> so<00:00:10.320> let's<00:00:10.500> go<00:00:10.590> ahead<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:10.769> get

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
the a spawn so let's go ahead and get

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.950 
the a spawn so let's go ahead and get
into<00:00:11.099> it<00:00:11.280> when<00:00:11.670> you're<00:00:11.790> spotting<00:00:12.150> down<00:00:12.300> at<00:00:12.719> the

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960

into it when you're spotting down at the
bottom<00:00:13.170> of<00:00:13.440> see<00:00:13.740> this<00:00:13.920> is<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.160> best<00:00:14.340> area<00:00:15.059> to

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
bottom of see this is the best area to

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.210 
bottom of see this is the best area to
be<00:00:15.240> spawning<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.960> sometimes<00:00:16.740> you<00:00:16.920> can<00:00:17.039> end<00:00:17.160> up

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
be spawning and sometimes you can end up

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.859 
be spawning and sometimes you can end up
getting<00:00:17.490> quads<00:00:17.730> from<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.330> beginning<00:00:18.480> which

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
getting quads from the beginning which

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.510 
getting quads from the beginning which
is<00:00:18.990> always<00:00:19.199> exciting<00:00:19.470> but<00:00:19.800> basically<00:00:20.340> you're

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
is always exciting but basically you're

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.890 
is always exciting but basically you're
going<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.760> use<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.910> javelin<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.420> run<00:00:21.510> out<00:00:21.630> here

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
going to use a javelin to run out here

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.840 
going to use a javelin to run out here
and<00:00:22.080> above<00:00:22.769> there<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.189> actually<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.580> glass

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
and above there is actually a glass

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.370 
and above there is actually a glass
piece<00:00:24.150> right<00:00:24.330> there<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.510> just<00:00:24.720> usually<00:00:24.990> shoot

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
piece right there I just usually shoot

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.259 
piece right there I just usually shoot
it<00:00:25.470> off<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.859> then<00:00:25.890> actually<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.640> aim<00:00:26.910> right<00:00:27.210> for

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
it off and then actually I aim right for

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.029 
it off and then actually I aim right for
that<00:00:27.480> little<00:00:27.660> black<00:00:27.960> camera<00:00:28.619> spot<00:00:28.920> or

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
that little black camera spot or

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.710 
that little black camera spot or
whatever<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.429> right<00:00:29.640> there<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:30.029> aim<00:00:30.449> right

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
whatever it is right there I aim right

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.510 
whatever it is right there I aim right
on<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.080> when<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.289> lock<00:00:31.470> on<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:31.980> for<00:00:32.340> some

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
on it when you lock on to that for some

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.000 
on it when you lock on to that for some
reason<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:33.600> just<00:00:33.809> seems<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.440> touch<00:00:34.860> down

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
reason it just seems to touch down

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.620 
reason it just seems to touch down
perfectly<00:00:35.399> sometimes<00:00:35.820> when<00:00:36.030> i<00:00:36.059> use<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.360> spot

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
perfectly sometimes when i use that spot

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.959 
perfectly sometimes when i use that spot
if<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.380> hit<00:00:37.620> up<00:00:37.649> too<00:00:37.980> high<00:00:38.160> on<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.489> beam<00:00:38.700> it

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
if I hit up too high on that beam it

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.700 
if I hit up too high on that beam it
will<00:00:39.360> touch<00:00:39.660> down<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.379> won't<00:00:40.530> actually

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
will touch down and it won't actually

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.430 
will touch down and it won't actually
work<00:00:41.070> very<00:00:41.309> well<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.540> best<00:00:42.750> kind

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
work very well so that is the best kind

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.229 
work very well so that is the best kind
of<00:00:43.559> spot<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:44.129> lock<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.460> if<00:00:44.820> you're<00:00:45.000> feeling

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
of spot to lock in if you're feeling

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.520 
of spot to lock in if you're feeling
brave<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.750> want<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.930> be<00:00:46.020> in<00:00:46.110> this<00:00:46.200> building

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
brave and want to be in this building

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.500 
brave and want to be in this building
this<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.800> ultimately<00:00:47.760> probably<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.360> best

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
this is ultimately probably the best

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.139 
this is ultimately probably the best
spot<00:00:48.719> in<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.870> game<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.649> use<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.250> javelin<00:00:50.670> when

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
spot in the game to use a javelin when

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.220 
spot in the game to use a javelin when
they<00:00:51.270> have<00:00:51.420> them<00:00:51.600> when<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.020> have<00:00:52.140> them

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
they have them when you have them

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.500 
they have them when you have them
spawned<00:00:52.620> at<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.920> use<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.789> javelin<00:00:54.059> spot<00:00:54.360> you

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
spawned at a use that javelin spot you

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.450 
spawned at a use that javelin spot you
lock<00:00:54.989> on<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.379> beam<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:55.829> just<00:00:56.039> did<00:00:56.250> and

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
lock on to that beam that I just did and

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.220 
lock on to that beam that I just did and
it's<00:00:56.940> amazing<00:00:57.329> now<00:00:57.420> for<00:00:57.660> right<00:00:57.780> here<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.109> can

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
it's amazing now for right here you can

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.979 
it's amazing now for right here you can
also<00:00:58.379> lock<00:00:58.739> on<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.239> dream<00:01:00.420> part<00:01:00.780> where<00:01:00.930> it

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
also lock on to the dream part where it

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.389 
also lock on to the dream part where it
says<00:01:01.020> dream<00:01:01.379> at<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.590> top<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:01.980> believe<00:01:02.190> it's<00:01:02.309> his

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
says dream at the top I believe it's his

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.340 
says dream at the top I believe it's his

dream or something lock on to the top
and<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.739> actually<00:01:04.920> ends<00:01:05.369> up<00:01:05.400> working<00:01:05.610> perfect

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
and it actually ends up working perfect

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.460 
and it actually ends up working perfect

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
off and it will actually touch down in

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.200 
off and it will actually touch down in
there<00:01:13.590> as<00:01:13.680> well<00:01:13.710> when<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.729> have<00:01:14.880> them<00:01:15.030> trapped

at a spawn that's amazing and you can
get<00:01:17.850> doubles<00:01:18.240> triples<00:01:18.450> quads<00:01:18.960> all<00:01:19.799> day<00:01:20.009> long

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.969 
get doubles triples quads all day long
from<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.880> spot<00:01:21.090> now<00:01:21.270> if<00:01:21.600> there<00:01:22.080> are<00:01:22.320> pushing

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.830 
from that spot now if there are pushing
up<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.460> they're<00:01:23.670> pushing<00:01:23.970> over<00:01:24.240> towards<00:01:24.540> see

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
up and they're pushing over towards see

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.660 
up and they're pushing over towards see
and<00:01:25.140> they're<00:01:25.229> stuck<00:01:25.590> in<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.770> middle<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.159> can

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
and they're stuck in the middle you can

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.609 
and they're stuck in the middle you can
lock<00:01:26.939> on<00:01:27.150> back<00:01:27.450> here<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.020> if<00:01:28.170> they're<00:01:28.380> usually

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
lock on back here and if they're usually

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.560 
lock on back here and if they're usually
if<00:01:28.979> they're<00:01:29.130> really<00:01:29.579> busy<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.090> moving<00:01:30.420> back

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
if they're really busy and moving back

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.749 
if they're really busy and moving back
and<00:01:30.720> forth<00:01:31.009> or<00:01:32.009> they're<00:01:32.369> just<00:01:32.400> kind<00:01:32.729> of

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
and forth or they're just kind of

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:33.980 
and forth or they're just kind of
camping<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.180> there<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.390> can<00:01:33.479> use<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.750> spot

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
camping in there you can use that spot

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.380 
camping in there you can use that spot
and<00:01:34.020> sometimes<00:01:34.470> it'll<00:01:34.619> kill<00:01:34.770> them<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:35.729> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
and sometimes it'll kill them in the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.969 
and sometimes it'll kill them in the
very<00:01:36.630> back<00:01:36.840> now<00:01:37.350> let's<00:01:37.530> try<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.680> figure<00:01:37.799> out

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
very back now let's try to figure out

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.440 
very back now let's try to figure out
how<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.130> hit<00:01:38.310> see<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.700> actually<00:01:38.790> showed<00:01:39.180> up<00:01:39.299> I

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
how to hit see it actually showed up I

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.609 
how to hit see it actually showed up I
did<00:01:39.720> figure<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:40.020> out<00:01:40.110> at<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.290> end<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.530> this

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
did figure it out at the end of this

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.190 
did figure it out at the end of this
video<00:01:41.100> on<00:01:41.759> how<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:41.970> actually<00:01:42.180> hit<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.780> people

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
video on how to actually hit the people

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.359 
video on how to actually hit the people
that<00:01:43.320> are<00:01:43.350> camping<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.799> top<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.100> C<00:01:44.189> which<00:01:44.340> is

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
that are camping the top of C which is

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.639 
that are camping the top of C which is
pretty<00:01:44.549> cool<00:01:44.810> but<00:01:45.810> i'll<00:01:46.229> show<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.470> guys<00:01:46.590> that

pretty cool but i'll show you guys that
in<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:46.950> second<00:01:47.250> there's<00:01:47.610> not<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.729> ton<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:47.970> javelin

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
in a second there's not a ton of javelin

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.789 
in a second there's not a ton of javelin
spots<00:01:48.570> but<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.780> ones<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.079> are<00:01:49.350> on<00:01:49.470> here<00:01:49.500> are

spots but the ones that are on here are

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.469 
spots but the ones that are on here are
very<00:01:50.040> effective<00:01:50.460> some<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.060> them<00:01:51.119> are<00:01:51.210> quads

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
very effective some of them are quads

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.359 
very effective some of them are quads
were<00:01:51.689> sure<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:51.899> this<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.320> spot<00:01:52.649> if<00:01:53.100> they<00:01:53.340> are

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.830 
were sure and this is a spot if they are
spawning<00:01:53.729> seaside<00:01:54.210> i'm<00:01:54.420> just<00:01:54.630> showing<00:01:54.720> you

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
spawning seaside i'm just showing you

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.600 
spawning seaside i'm just showing you
guys<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.229> can<00:01:55.439> get<00:01:55.619> clearance<00:01:56.009> from<00:01:56.430> the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
guys you can get clearance from the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.609 
guys you can get clearance from the
plane<00:01:56.820> if<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.119> sit<00:01:57.360> back<00:01:57.509> far<00:01:57.780> enough<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.200> you

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
plane if you sit back far enough and you

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.899 
plane if you sit back far enough and you
can<00:01:58.799> see<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.009> if<00:01:59.250> they're<00:01:59.399> spawning<00:01:59.640> down

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
can see that if they're spawning down

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.399 
can see that if they're spawning down
there<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.240> will<00:02:00.390> touch<00:02:00.630> down<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.110> can<00:02:01.229> get

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
there it will touch down and you can get

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.980 
there it will touch down and you can get
some<00:02:01.500> nice<00:02:01.680> kills<00:02:01.950> but<00:02:02.610> unfortunately<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.869> is

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
some nice kills but unfortunately it is

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.359 
some nice kills but unfortunately it is
a<00:02:04.020> tough<00:02:04.229> one<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.530> pull<00:02:04.680> off<00:02:04.860> on<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.130> regular

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
a tough one to pull off on a regular

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.029 
a tough one to pull off on a regular
basis<00:02:05.820> now<00:02:06.600> if<00:02:06.899> you're<00:02:07.350> spawning<00:02:07.770> at<00:02:07.950> the

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
basis now if you're spawning at the

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.100 
basis now if you're spawning at the
other<00:02:08.190> end<00:02:08.489> just<00:02:09.479> showing<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:09.690> guys<00:02:09.780> some<00:02:09.869> of

other end just showing you guys some of

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.860 
other end just showing you guys some of
the<00:02:10.170> javelins<00:02:10.530> blocks<00:02:10.739> from<00:02:10.860> this<00:02:11.069> side

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
the javelins blocks from this side

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.870 
the javelins blocks from this side
ideally<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:12.959> would<00:02:13.050> run<00:02:13.200> over<00:02:13.260> here

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
ideally you would run over here

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.670 
ideally you would run over here
now<00:02:14.090> you<00:02:14.150> know<00:02:14.360> that<00:02:14.600> it's<00:02:14.990> the<00:02:15.230> worst<00:02:15.440> when

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
now you know that it's the worst when

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.500 
now you know that it's the worst when
you<00:02:15.740> get<00:02:15.860> trapped<00:02:16.130> inside<00:02:16.400> of<00:02:16.850> the<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:17.000> spawn

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
you get trapped inside of the a spawn

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.270 
you get trapped inside of the a spawn
right<00:02:18.080> in<00:02:18.230> this<00:02:18.410> little<00:02:18.650> building<00:02:18.800> because

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
right in this little building because

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.100 
right in this little building because
they<00:02:19.580> just<00:02:19.850> they<00:02:20.090> go<00:02:20.240> ham<00:02:20.450> they<00:02:20.690> knew<00:02:20.810> two<00:02:21.050> of

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
they just they go ham they knew two of

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.860 
they just they go ham they knew two of
you<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:21.440> you<00:02:22.100> stop<00:02:22.730> get<00:02:23.060> sniped<00:02:23.270> the<00:02:23.540> entire

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
you and you stop get sniped the entire

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.360 
you and you stop get sniped the entire
time<00:02:24.080> it's<00:02:24.290> horrible<00:02:24.530> but<00:02:24.650> you<00:02:25.010> can<00:02:25.160> see<00:02:25.280> the

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
time it's horrible but you can see the

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.440 
time it's horrible but you can see the
clearance<00:02:25.640> at<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.760> top<00:02:25.940> right<00:02:26.090> there<00:02:26.300> I

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
clearance at the top right there I

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.300 
clearance at the top right there I
usually<00:02:27.020> just<00:02:27.050> lock<00:02:27.350> on<00:02:27.530> over<00:02:27.860> here<00:02:28.040> to<00:02:28.190> this

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
usually just lock on over here to this

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.610 
usually just lock on over here to this
building<00:02:28.610> if<00:02:29.210> you<00:02:29.360> fire<00:02:29.660> from<00:02:29.990> right<00:02:30.140> there<00:02:30.350> it

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
building if you fire from right there it

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.140 
building if you fire from right there it
will<00:02:30.740> go<00:02:30.920> up<00:02:31.100> through<00:02:31.370> that<00:02:31.400> hole<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:31.940> you<00:02:31.970> can

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
will go up through that hole and you can

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.790 
will go up through that hole and you can
actually<00:02:32.330> kill<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.750> guys<00:02:32.960> on<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.260> back

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.360 
actually kill the guys on the back
camping<00:02:34.490> or<00:02:35.360> in<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.810> back<00:02:35.990> area<00:02:36.260> of<00:02:36.920> that<00:02:36.950> area

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.680 
camping or in the back area of that area
where<00:02:37.640> they're<00:02:37.760> just<00:02:37.940> kind<00:02:38.300> of<00:02:38.330> hugged<00:02:38.540> up

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
where they're just kind of hugged up

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.710 
where they're just kind of hugged up
against<00:02:39.020> the<00:02:39.440> wall<00:02:39.680> or<00:02:40.180> under<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.270> bunker<00:02:41.570> if

against the wall or under the bunker if
you<00:02:42.020> will<00:02:42.880> anyway<00:02:43.880> so<00:02:43.940> you<00:02:44.630> can't<00:02:44.810> get<00:02:44.900> them

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
you will anyway so you can't get them

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.480 
you will anyway so you can't get them
inside<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:45.350> bunker<00:02:45.560> though<00:02:45.770> I<00:02:45.800> just<00:02:46.250> to

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
inside the bunker though I just to

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.310 
inside the bunker though I just to
clarify<00:02:46.790> but<00:02:47.390> this<00:02:47.600> is<00:02:47.720> another<00:02:47.870> spot<00:02:48.200> you<00:02:48.290> can

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
clarify but this is another spot you can

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.930 
clarify but this is another spot you can
actually<00:02:48.590> use<00:02:48.860> to<00:02:49.040> clear<00:02:49.250> them<00:02:49.340> from<00:02:49.370> see<00:02:49.760> if

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
actually use to clear them from see if

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.460 
actually use to clear them from see if
they're<00:02:50.060> pushing<00:02:50.330> up<00:02:50.420> seaside<00:02:51.170> and<00:02:51.350> I'm

here it's kind of crazy you can shoot

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.660 
here it's kind of crazy you can shoot
the<00:03:24.440> javelin<00:03:24.830> up<00:03:24.920> there<00:03:25.130> and<00:03:25.280> it<00:03:25.340> will<00:03:25.460> touch

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
the javelin up there and it will touch

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.100 
the javelin up there and it will touch
down<00:03:25.700> and<00:03:26.120> hit<00:03:26.270> them<00:03:26.450> you<00:03:26.630> can<00:03:26.780> get<00:03:26.930> some

down and hit them you can get some
doubles<00:03:27.410> quads<00:03:28.070> if<00:03:28.280> you<00:03:28.400> end<00:03:28.580> up<00:03:28.640> timing<00:03:28.970> it

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
doubles quads if you end up timing it

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.820 
doubles quads if you end up timing it
perfectly<00:03:29.090> but<00:03:29.540> it's<00:03:29.780> hard<00:03:29.960> to<00:03:30.050> do<00:03:30.200> and<00:03:30.410> this

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
perfectly but it's hard to do and this

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.440 
perfectly but it's hard to do and this
is<00:03:30.980> me<00:03:31.130> showing<00:03:31.280> you<00:03:31.400> can<00:03:31.790> do<00:03:31.910> it<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.120> opposite

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
is me showing you can do it the opposite

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.450 
is me showing you can do it the opposite
way<00:03:32.510> as<00:03:32.750> well<00:03:32.900> you<00:03:33.770> can<00:03:33.920> shoot<00:03:34.040> it<00:03:34.160> down<00:03:34.280> the

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:34.460 
way as well you can shoot it down the

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.650 
way as well you can shoot it down the
hallway<00:03:34.700> right<00:03:34.880> there<00:03:35.090> and<00:03:35.270> you<00:03:35.330> can<00:03:35.450> actually

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
hallway right there and you can actually

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.540 
hallway right there and you can actually
go<00:03:35.990> up<00:03:36.020> and<00:03:36.410> it<00:03:36.950> will<00:03:37.040> touch<00:03:37.160> down<00:03:37.190> on<00:03:37.400> the

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
go up and it will touch down on the

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.760 
go up and it will touch down on the
other<00:03:37.670> side<00:03:37.850> pretty<00:03:38.420> cool<00:03:38.600> jalen<00:03:38.960> spot<00:03:39.200> but

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
other side pretty cool jalen spot but

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.710 
other side pretty cool jalen spot but
definitely<00:03:40.490> the<00:03:40.580> one<00:03:40.700> to<00:03:40.760> a<00:03:40.970> is<00:03:41.270> the<00:03:41.480> best

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
definitely the one to a is the best

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.660 
definitely the one to a is the best
probably<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:42.770> best<00:03:42.950> javelin<00:03:43.280> spot<00:03:43.490> in<00:03:43.580> the

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
probably the best javelin spot in the

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.520 
probably the best javelin spot in the
game<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:44.000> easiest<00:03:44.360> one<00:03:44.510> to<00:03:44.540> get<00:03:44.720> multi<00:03:45.260> kills

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
game the easiest one to get multi kills

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.920 
game the easiest one to get multi kills
consistently<00:03:46.270> well<00:03:47.270> actually<00:03:47.420> I<00:03:47.630> take<00:03:47.870> that
