00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:09.100
 they present that if they give it to the 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.100
 green will go up 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:24.439
 and we would not miss the words 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.510
 good if missing but less and less 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:30.109
 because that 's what luis piedrahita and 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.360
 that certainly does not miss your appointment this 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.400
 weekend is with his show the 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.590
 Castilian is a laudable praiseworthy language and 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.230
 praiseworthy this weekend in theaters 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.050
 Callao in Madrid as always next 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.340
 is when will be in Bilbao at the theater 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.770
 Elysian Fields 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.010
 right truth is that's how it is good 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.270
 I'll wait for Bilbao and here I'll wait for you 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.990
 Madrid missing the words are missing 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:57.110
 the words roberto because the words 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.910
 they are scarce as a cyclops legaÃ±a 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.190
 you have to find words that give 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.339
 name to what we feel sometimes for 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:08.390
 example urgently find a word that 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:11.150
 designate those things that one takes 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.790
 of bath to not get bored to the set of 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.770
 all things that's something is almost worth 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.670
 anything is worth a catalog of 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.520
 Wheel offers wheels and a boat of 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.320
 shampoo to read a one - eyed hamster one 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.750
 pineapple yogurt anything 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.030
 It entertains you when you're on the toilet 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.030
 why then because when the 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.119
 Busy stools you need something that 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.580
 accompany you and how can we call it 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:41.090
 that we take to the toilet to 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:46.149
 cope with those minutes of loneliness like 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.450
 I propose constipation constipation 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.640
 constipation 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.640
 and the definition would be such that 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.439
 constipation 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.920
 what is not yet carried to the bathroom 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:03.750
 to make the deposition entertaining and 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:08.490
 distract the depositor 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:11.280
 trousseau or bathroom 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.230
 that's entertainment strategy let's go 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.870
 to another first word another thing and 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.210
 more look at this more we know all but 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.450
 no no no no we do not practice 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:24.030
 vacations are to rest for tours 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.070
 I say it now in Holy Week the 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.860
 vacations are to rest without 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.510
 But there is a type of vacation from 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.900
 that one returns worse than it was 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.360
 those atrocious family trips in the 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.750
 that you do everything that you never do 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.840
 see a museum with children visit 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.690
 monuments with children trace 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.150
 ravines with children will leave rivers 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.300
 with children is to dine in a helicopter 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.580
 the controls kids clear if they left you a 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.239
 more day would be to finish your own 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.130
 grave with children too and that happens 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.690
 always when you just do not propose not 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.910
 these holidays are going to be for 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.490
 rest because we actually get 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.000
 in those berenjenales 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.530
 as we can call I wonder myself and it 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.360
 will ask all the people who will 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.660
 certain questions are now as 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:18.850
 we can call that kind of trip in the 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:21.650
 that one dies a little bit I propose 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.110
 torture and short tourism that's the guy 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.940
 of travel we do for tourism and 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.940
 definition would be such that 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.180
 For tourism 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:38.600
 rest misunderstanding holiday period 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.660
 of which one gets more tired than 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.210
 it was the trip from which one returns 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:48.160
 exhausted and battered but with the 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:52.640
 hope to repeat the following summer 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:55.700
 read summer suicide with children that 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.470
 is for tourism next again more 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.250
 that we want something else that does not have 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.080
 name and obviously he needs 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.610
 When we wait for a person, look 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.800
 this very feeling of anguish and 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:10.220
 anxiety when we wait for a person 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.170
 and we looked to see if we were 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.210
 we look to see if it is today 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.890
 noise and you look like a little dog that 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:19.360
 listen to your master's keys 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.360
 I will not tell you 20 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:32.870
 25 25 and slowly and effectively more today is 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.040
 a noise and you look like a dog you look 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.890
 to the window 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.230
 If you have stayed in the portal, you approach 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.820
 the corner because it gives you the feeling of 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.620
 that if you do it is sure it will appear 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.680
 I'll do it before, like counting up 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.410
 come or pick up telephony 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.840
 a friend is simply hung up 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.780
 also how can we call that 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.720
 feeling so noble that it brings us to 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:00.250
 look to see if the expected person is coming 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.910
 idea I propose to unsettle you are 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:06.400
 restless dance 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.400
 and the definition would be such that 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:13.750
 restless dance 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:17.139
 look anxious with the illusion of seeing 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:20.139
 come to the one who does not arrive feeling that 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:22.960
 takes to look at the horizon of the 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:23.800
 unpunctuality that is disturbing gives very 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.229
 all right 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.860
 we are learning a lot and trying 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:32.229
 to study one that I love is 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:35.889
 Alegre is optimistic and smiling with a 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:38.830
 wonderful there are fits of laughter 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:41.139
 very difficult to control and also one 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.819
 as it is that it is rogue and with the 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:44.919
 friends when you get a fit of laughter 

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:47.199
 and you have to keep it inside of you 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:49.090
 those fits of laughter those that it seems that 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:52.120
 they're not going to end you 'll never get to the 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:54.969
 laugh if you look at your accomplice and it is worse 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.979
 that you see him holding everything red 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:58.900
 tearful that comes out through the ears the 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:01.439
 reid actively see it shining 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.909
 shining patent like an amygdala 

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:05.830
 You think you are going to die and I will not be able to 

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:08.560
 go to his funeral home or to his funeral 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:11.199
 because it's going to make me laugh to see him with that 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:14.200
 face you can not breathe you cry 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:17.500
 eyes you snot fall hahaha 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:20.530
 and suddenly to suddenly to the sun 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:24.490
 that does not stop and does not come back and one comes back in 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:27.400
 yes and you have like laces you hurt the 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:29.790
 head your stomach hurts your muscles 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.260
 of the face you are as untidy 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:35.830
 you discover that you have always looked at yourself 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:37.960
 there have always been cases of a friend 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:41.410
 it has happened not to me not as to my friend not 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:44.290
 how can we call all those 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:47.140
 physical hardships that you experience a 

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:50.100
 organism after a fit of laughter 

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:53.950
 And what do you propose, I propose laughter 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:55.810
 arrixaca is the pain the pain of the day of 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:59.460
 the moment after the laughter is in 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.460
 definition would be such that 

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:05.190
 arrixaca 

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:08.940
 discomfort that is experienced when returning 

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:11.970
 from a fit of laughing laces of 

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:14.940
 hilarity and if you want to experience 

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:18.240
