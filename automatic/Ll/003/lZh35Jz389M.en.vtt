that's<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.369> easier<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:33.120> adapt<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.660> but<00:00:33.930> it

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
that's the easier to adapt it but it

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.049 
that's the easier to adapt it but it

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
that at the moment but i'm sure they

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.529 
that at the moment but i'm sure they
will<00:00:44.219> in<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.430> future<00:00:44.460> presence<00:00:45.300> you've<00:00:45.390> got<00:00:45.510> a

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
will in the future presence you've got a

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.330 
will in the future presence you've got a
fully<00:00:45.870> functional<00:00:46.289> control<00:00:46.649> center<00:00:47.039> we've

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
fully functional control center we've

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.490 
fully functional control center we've
got<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.640> home<00:00:48.329> screen<00:00:48.629> which<00:00:48.750> looks<00:00:48.930> identical

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
got a home screen which looks identical

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.529 
got a home screen which looks identical
to<00:00:49.530> hire<00:00:49.680> 7<00:00:50.160> but<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.120> think<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.329> best

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
to hire 7 but that I think the best

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.600 
to hire 7 but that I think the best
thing<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.199> control<00:00:52.530> center<00:00:52.949> just<00:00:53.399> how

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
thing is the control center just how

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.610 
thing is the control center just how
much<00:00:53.820> they've<00:00:54.120> just<00:00:54.600> pulled<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.199> off<00:00:55.320> so

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
much they've just pulled that off so

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.290 
much they've just pulled that off so
well<00:00:55.800> you've<00:00:56.070> got<00:00:56.219> an<00:00:56.309> adapted<00:00:56.760> camera<00:00:57.149> which

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
well you've got an adapted camera which

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.930 
well you've got an adapted camera which
looks<00:00:57.510> almost<00:00:58.199> identical<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.250> iOS<00:00:59.609> 7

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
looks almost identical to the iOS 7

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.610 
looks almost identical to the iOS 7
camera<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.510> also<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.199> don't<00:01:01.320> get<00:01:01.500> the

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
camera and also you don't get the

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.439 
camera and also you don't get the
autofocus<00:01:01.980> but<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.340> get<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.489> fake<00:01:02.760> autofocus

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
autofocus but you get a fake autofocus

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.630 
autofocus but you get a fake autofocus
you<00:01:03.780> have<00:01:03.960> got<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.080> very<00:01:04.199> similar<00:01:05.070> music<00:01:05.489> app

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
you have got a very similar music app

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.550 
you have got a very similar music app
widget<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.360> isn't<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.750> best<00:01:06.960> polished<00:01:07.380> way

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
widget this isn't the best polished way

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.289 
widget this isn't the best polished way
but<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.010> definitely<00:01:08.189> looks<00:01:08.520> much<00:01:08.700> like<00:01:09.060> the

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
but it definitely looks much like the

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.719 
but it definitely looks much like the
iowa<00:01:09.570> 71<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.740> works<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.280> works<00:01:11.369> very<00:01:11.610> well

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
iowa 71 and it works it works very well

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.149 
iowa 71 and it works it works very well
and<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.570> be<00:01:12.689> honest<00:01:12.930> it's<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.260> very<00:01:13.500> very<00:01:13.619> lag

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
and to be honest it's a very very lag

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.249 
and to be honest it's a very very lag
free<00:01:14.490> operating<00:01:14.820> system<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.540> soon<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.140> is

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
free operating system and soon this is

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.840 
free operating system and soon this is
an<00:01:16.350> old<00:01:16.500> device<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:17.070> runs<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.610> really

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
an old device it runs it really

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.270 
an old device it runs it really
optimizes<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.750> hardware<00:01:19.170> very<00:01:19.380> well<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:20.130> talk

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
optimizes the hardware very well to talk

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.740 
optimizes the hardware very well to talk
about<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.549> camera<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:20.939> do<00:01:21.240> actually<00:01:21.570> also

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
about the camera you do actually also

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.749 
about the camera you do actually also
get<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> video<00:01:22.229> capability<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.640> done

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
get a video capability so this is done

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.070 
get a video capability so this is done
by<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.000> cydia<00:01:24.479> tweak<00:01:24.720> which<00:01:24.840> comes

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
by a cydia tweak which comes

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.140

adverse effects could happen to your
device<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.310> so<00:01:59.610> things<00:01:59.820> like<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.030> but<00:02:00.390> it

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
device and so things like that but it

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.810 
device and so things like that but it
just<00:02:00.540> allows<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.229> really<00:02:01.430> maximize<00:02:02.430> the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
just allows you to really maximize the

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.370 
just allows you to really maximize the
performances<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:03.600> say<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:03.840> find<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.259> your

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
performances so say you find that your

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.139 
performances so say you find that your
folders<00:02:04.829> are<00:02:04.950> slowing<00:02:05.189> down<00:02:05.369> your<00:02:05.490> device<00:02:05.759> can

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
folders are slowing down your device can

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.089 
folders are slowing down your device can
actually<00:02:06.360> just<00:02:06.479> disable<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.140> folders<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.710> it

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
actually just disable the folders and it

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.219 
actually just disable the folders and it
just<00:02:08.280> speeds<00:02:08.459> up<00:02:08.729> she<00:02:09.239> also<00:02:09.360> have<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.660> iOS<00:02:09.959> 7

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
just speeds up she also have the iOS 7
