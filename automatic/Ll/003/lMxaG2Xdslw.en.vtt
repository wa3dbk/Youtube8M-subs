via Molly he played with spirit last

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.400 
via Molly he played with spirit last
year<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.000> he<00:00:39.149> was<00:00:39.180> pretty<00:00:39.870> strong<00:00:40.170> for<00:00:40.379> us

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
year and he was pretty strong for us

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.869 
year and he was pretty strong for us
from<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.680> outside<00:00:40.950> backs<00:00:41.160> last<00:00:41.430> year<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:41.790> i'm

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
from the outside backs last year so i'm

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.940
