00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
you can go ahead and speed that up a

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.700 
you can go ahead and speed that up a
little<00:00:44.820> bit<00:00:44.940> if<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.149> want<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.539> we<00:00:46.440> will<00:00:46.590> do

little bit if you want to we will do

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.170 
little bit if you want to we will do
this<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.890> few<00:00:47.010> hundred<00:00:47.399> times<00:00:47.579> until<00:00:47.969> we<00:00:48.030> get

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
this a few hundred times until we get

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.490 
this a few hundred times until we get
pretty<00:00:48.420> accurate<00:00:48.870> with<00:00:48.899> pointing<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:49.440> the

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
pretty accurate with pointing in the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.290 
pretty accurate with pointing in the
direction<00:00:49.530> we<00:00:50.190> want<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.430> throw<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.910> then<00:00:51.149> get

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
direction we want to throw and then get

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.569 
direction we want to throw and then get
it<00:00:51.420> right<00:00:51.719> into<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.020> court<00:00:52.280> now<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.340> only

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
it right into the court now the only

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.700 
it right into the court now the only
difference<00:00:53.879> between<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:55.050> serve<00:00:55.320> is

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
difference between this and a serve is

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.160 
difference between this and a serve is
now<00:00:56.399> we're<00:00:56.789> going<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:56.969> toss<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.420> ball<00:00:57.449> we're

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
now we're going to toss the ball we're

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.540 
now we're going to toss the ball we're
going<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.379> point<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.949> ball<00:00:59.100> up<00:00:59.309> in<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.460> air

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
going to point to the ball up in the air

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.920 
going to point to the ball up in the air
and<00:00:59.940> then<00:01:00.210> we're<00:01:00.300> going<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.480> try<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.690> throw

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
and then we're going to try to throw

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.990 
and then we're going to try to throw
another<00:01:01.289> ball<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.739> hit<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.399> out<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.550> there

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
another ball and hit it out of there

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.579 
another ball and hit it out of there
very<00:01:03.270> difficult<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.780> do<00:01:03.930> we're<00:01:04.409> going<00:01:04.530> to

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
very difficult to do we're going to

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.020 
very difficult to do we're going to
practice<00:01:04.799> this<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.189> we<00:01:05.369> can<00:01:05.460> get<00:01:05.549> used<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.909> that

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
practice this so we can get used to that

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.850 
practice this so we can get used to that
point<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.659> throw<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.170> then<00:01:07.590> we're<00:01:07.680> going<00:01:07.799> to

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
point and throw and then we're going to

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.890 
point and throw and then we're going to
incorporate<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.400> racquet<00:01:08.700> later<00:01:08.880> okay<00:01:09.840> so

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
incorporate the racquet later okay so

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.390 
incorporate the racquet later okay so
the<00:01:10.200> first<00:01:10.320> thing<00:01:10.530> we<00:01:10.619> want<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.799> do<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.189> we<00:01:11.280> want

sure<00:01:29.909> we<00:01:30.030> get<00:01:30.119> nice<00:01:30.390> extension<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.350> really<00:01:32.040> go

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
sure we get nice extension and really go

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.130 
sure we get nice extension and really go
pretty<00:01:32.909> hard<00:01:33.180> when<00:01:33.329> we're<00:01:33.509> doing<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:33.900> now

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140

that's not the idea the idea is to get
comfortable<00:01:38.100> with<00:01:38.400> this<00:01:38.579> type<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:38.790> motion<00:01:39.090> but

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
comfortable with this type of motion but

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.969 
comfortable with this type of motion but

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
break down pronation into three simple

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.330

moves<00:03:30.900> that<00:03:31.380> you<00:03:31.530> can<00:03:31.650> incorporate<00:03:31.890> into<00:03:32.280> your

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
moves that you can incorporate into your

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.940 
moves that you can incorporate into your
own<00:03:32.520> game<00:03:32.790> let's<00:03:33.360> go<00:03:33.480> and<00:03:33.630> get<00:03:33.720> started<00:03:33.950> okay

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
own game let's go and get started okay

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.140 
own game let's go and get started okay
so<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.190> first<00:03:35.370> thing<00:03:35.520> we<00:03:35.610> need<00:03:35.730> to<00:03:35.790> understand

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
so the first thing we need to understand

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.310 
so the first thing we need to understand
is<00:03:36.300> when<00:03:36.450> we're<00:03:36.570> talking<00:03:36.690> about<00:03:36.870> pronation

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
is when we're talking about pronation

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.650 
is when we're talking about pronation
how<00:03:37.590> does<00:03:37.770> this<00:03:37.860> add<00:03:38.070> speed<00:03:38.670> to<00:03:38.910> our<00:03:39.060> serve<00:03:39.330> and

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
how does this add speed to our serve and

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.350 
how does this add speed to our serve and
when<00:03:40.170> I<00:03:40.230> see<00:03:40.410> many<00:03:41.010> beginner<00:03:41.430> tennis<00:03:42.120> players

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
when I see many beginner tennis players

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.060 
when I see many beginner tennis players
when<00:03:42.810> they<00:03:42.930> were<00:03:43.050> very<00:03:43.410> first<00:03:43.680> starting<00:03:43.980> to

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
when they were very first starting to

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.560 
when they were very first starting to
play<00:03:44.220> tennis<00:03:44.460> a<00:03:44.730> lot<00:03:44.910> of<00:03:45.120> times<00:03:45.300> what<00:03:45.450> they'll

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
play tennis a lot of times what they'll

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:46.370 
play tennis a lot of times what they'll
want<00:03:45.660> to<00:03:45.780> do<00:03:45.870> when<00:03:45.990> they're<00:03:46.110> hitting<00:03:46.290> their

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
service keep the strings facing the

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.510 
service keep the strings facing the
opposing<00:03:49.200> side<00:03:49.830> of<00:03:49.860> the<00:03:49.950> court<00:03:50.040> so<00:03:50.370> let's

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520
