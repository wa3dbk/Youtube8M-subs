00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.809
 hello friends with you again I 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:15.400
 Yuri Timoschuk You are on my 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.740
 channel balls and decor 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.750
 we are engaged in arched us 2 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.810
 sting and everything related to the decor and 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:26.500
 balls mostly today still want 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:29.650
 raise such a question than you can 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.359
 draw on the inflatable balls because sometimes 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.059
 I have to paint them 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:37.750
 for example you need to draw some 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:39.309
 face muzzle eyes don't know yes all that 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.590
 anything or just decorate 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.500
 sometimes you have to paint so what 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.920
 all the same you can draw on them if you 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.200
 I will give some examples such 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.079
 things like paint pencils can be immediately 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.149
 throw them on the balls nothing at all 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.010
 don't draw and fail or 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:01.059
 felt-tip pens in water based 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:04.210
 I want to start with them they draw but there is 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:09.880
 one but the first 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:15.849
 we try a felt pen ordinary as we see 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:19.509
 he draws paint like and not bad with 

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:22.569
 first side on one side but if 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.880
 take it with your finger 

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:27.209
 wiped off you say maybe she doesn't 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.889
 dried up yes I tried already tested 

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:31.719
 even if the ball lies for a while 

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:34.569
 still tones are very easy to erase 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:36.939
 as if he was not at all so 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:42.929
 we also drop it further we take 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:42.929
 ordinary ballpoint pen try 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:50.720
 and in my opinion not bad ballpoint pen 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.570
 I'll tell you decide even much better 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.580
 than the window ordinary marker so 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.770
 that you can take ordinary ball 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.260
 colored pens or draw a ball 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.500
 to like you try it with your finger 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:08.690
 erase how we see human revenues too 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:11.780
 erased but the trace still remains 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:17.330
 there is it will be better already 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:22.400
 take the marker permanent marker and 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:26.240
 try to draw something like im 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.760
 rides i 'll see a marker draws pretty well 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:33.290
 my best of all options 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.940
 he fits distraction high can 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.760
 be already dry let's try it 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.830
 wipe off 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:43.130
 here guys can not erase the marker 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:47.150
 it turns out on the hands nothing remains 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.690
 last and erase impossible for us by 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:54.290
 mine is even better than a ballpoint pen and 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:56.980
 I just want to talk about one more thing 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.590
 than you can even draw it 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.570
 corrector without corrector guys we are and 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.140
 further treat you just not 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.410
 because sometimes we can draw 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.160
 any 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:13.370
 face or eyes as I spoke our 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.500
 colored balls not only on white and us 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.230
 you need to make the teeth white correctly 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.870
 for this 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.030
 just need correctors because 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.280
 white markers do not happen probably yes we 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.940
 at least I haven't seen them yet 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.799
 to use 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:32.760
 we take a simple paper our marker 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:36.900
 we press on it we extrude some 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:40.920
 amount of this white matter a 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:44.480
 next just dunk and like a brush 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.480
 we draw on our ball 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:58.549
 dunk draw dunk 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:01.489
 you draw a white base here 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:05.650
 I hope we can see there is already a 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:08.120
 then you can already connect with the marker 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.189
 pen and so on here if you look 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.890
 it needs some kind of painted see 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:15.019
 teeth white eyes are white and very beautiful 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.720
 very bright so contrast I get 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:21.019
 First, we will do this with a corrector. 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.699
 then circled around the marker is obtained 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.770
 very cool these thin lines 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:27.430
 I poured it with a pen, although you can also take it 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:31.099
 the marker has markers 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:34.970
 a thin rod to draw NASA 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:39.349
 fine lines but basically this 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:41.479
 tricks with proofreader advise everyone 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:43.789
 enjoy very bright and beautiful 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:47.930
 drawings will be erased 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:51.470
 I, too, is not very reliable here so 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:54.470
 let's summarize in first place 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.990
 us remains a marker and 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:00.199
 corrector if we need a white base 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:04.550
 markers can be used in different colors 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:06.919
 in second place we have a pen if 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:10.970
 no at hand in the marker and also possible 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:14.090
 draw a ball well I donâ€™t know on the third 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:16.220
 place don't even want to send our 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.229
 markers because quickly erased 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.820
 so discard them altogether with 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.490
 pencils and paints and so on 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:27.039
 I advise you to use these 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:29.630
 things but all the guys are at it all 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:34.419
 comment write questions put 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.419
 likes all the best bye guys 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.990
 there
