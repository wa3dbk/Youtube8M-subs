00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.520 
do laughs but yes level 3 without dying
i<00:02:33.940> think<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.480> first<00:02:34.629> few<00:02:34.900> levels<00:02:35.079> they<00:02:35.379> make

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
i think the first few levels they make

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.369 
i think the first few levels they make
it<00:02:35.739> nice<00:02:36.730> and<00:02:36.760> sort<00:02:37.299> of<00:02:37.360> easy<00:02:37.870> though<00:02:38.140> don't

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
it nice and sort of easy though don't

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.199 
it nice and sort of easy though don't
like<00:02:38.560> so<00:02:38.860> i<00:02:38.890> guess<00:02:38.920> i'm<00:02:39.640> not<00:02:39.790> saying<00:02:40.000> that<00:02:40.060> was

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
like so i guess i'm not saying that was

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.910 
like so i guess i'm not saying that was
easy<00:02:40.450> for<00:02:40.540> you<00:02:40.810> but<00:02:40.900> I<00:02:40.989> make<00:02:41.170> it<00:02:41.319> just<00:02:41.470> oh<00:02:41.620> yeah

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
easy for you but I make it just oh yeah

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.619 
easy for you but I make it just oh yeah

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
progressively harder you all said it was

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:45.809
