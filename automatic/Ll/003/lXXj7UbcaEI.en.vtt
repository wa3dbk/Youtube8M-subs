listeners<00:00:54.269> little<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.689> separate<00:00:55.140> these<00:00:55.350> two

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:55.409 
listeners little to separate these two

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:57.560 
listeners little to separate these two
sides<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.129> think<00:00:56.309> one<00:00:56.549> chance<00:00:56.879> could<00:00:57.119> make<00:00:57.330> all

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
sides I think one chance could make all

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:23.420 
sides I think one chance could make all
the<00:00:57.600> difference

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:46.230
