challenge to a title at that division he

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.870

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:17.409 
real trick to the farthest movement here

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:19.139 
real trick to the farthest movement here
and<00:06:17.439> why<00:06:17.709> should<00:06:17.919> you<00:06:18.069> strike<00:06:18.339> off<00:06:18.550> balances

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:19.149 
and why should you strike off balances

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:20.820 
and why should you strike off balances
as<00:06:19.300> you<00:06:19.419> see<00:06:19.659> it's<00:06:19.929> a<00:06:19.959> good<00:06:20.080> job<00:06:20.289> of<00:06:20.439> moving<00:06:20.559> in

as you see it's a good job of moving in
both<00:06:21.009> directions<00:06:21.369> and<00:06:22.059> the<00:06:22.209> natural<00:06:22.659> movement

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110
