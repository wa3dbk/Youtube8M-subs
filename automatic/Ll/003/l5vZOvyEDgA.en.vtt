00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.620
 hi all guys this video is a 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.589
 particular 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.519
 I usually prefer to make the video in 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:15.299
 which shows the beauty of of games of 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.279
 everything I like usually doesn't 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.970
 I feel so comfortable doing blogs 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.750
 so this will be one of the first is 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.810
 probably one of the few anyway 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:31.349
 will be on a topic that is not 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:35.760
 literally relevant to the channel e 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.380
 it doesn't concern me in first person but us 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.890
 they are concepts that sincerely 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.450
 I would like to reiterate on youtube for a moment 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:52.680
 lately there has been a question between 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:55.410
 zeb 89 and jules kitten I don't want 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.680
 sticking in none in the high person 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.670
 absolutely because this is not me 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.670
 it is not interested 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.540
 I have nothing to say about the 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.720
 person to these two people why not 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.260
 I know what I want 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:17.310
 centralizing this blog is what it has 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:24.390
 said Serbian 89 about meaning 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:29.009
 of opinion because zeb 89 said that 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.900
 opinions must also be expressed 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.850
 offending others 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:40.290
 if then these are offended 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.780
 it's their fault now there's a problem here 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:48.090
 because this definition of opinion 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:51.030
 there is no user of the sat channel 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:55.880
 what a long time so you know that for 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.880
 agos is very very very important 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:04.799
 the free dissemination of opinions, however 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:10.110
 the meaning of opinion is not to say 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:11.740
 what you want and all the others don't 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.120
 I have to say nothing 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:18.720
 if you insult the other Sticazzi this 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.200
 it is not the meaning of opinion 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:27.070
 opinion is a shareable thing 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.500
 opinion able in practice an opinion not 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.600
 can be an insult does not exist one 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.290
 something like that 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:37.450
 an opinion must be able to be 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.270
 counterattacked you have to know how to accept the 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.920
 criticism of others and above all not 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.500
 you must not even offend the acts because 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.810
 if you offend a person you don't want that 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.610
 this person answers in a logical and if 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.820
 scams of a person 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.130
 you absolutely don't want a dialogue 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:58.650
 that is not an opinion is an offense 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:04.900
 point an opinion seeks a dialogue 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:08.800
 because an opinion by definition is a 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:11.410
 judgment or at least an idea and you do it 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:15.370
 through various people through one 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.290
 community to try to approach 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.840
 what can be a definition 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.420
 more correct more exact then search 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:28.870
 therefore a dialogue cannot be 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:32.730
 an offense that I wanted therefore to point out in 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:38.350
 this point cannot be expressed 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:40.360
 freely offending others 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.690
 people because this is no longer freedom 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.450
 it is simply selfishness 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:50.010
 freedom is also respect for others 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.010
 if you are in a community 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.760
 and I would also like to point out that there is a need 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.620
 also respect for other people 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:05.320
 because no one is superior to 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:08.770
 others have no social classes 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:12.640
 respect is important because we are 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:15.520
 all the same as was said in the 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.730
 story fortunately from people who 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.900
 they sacrificed their lives and that 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.900
 of others 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:35.330
 this is not a thing to be overlooked 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:37.520
 that is, I am not involved in the speech 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:42.110
 of zeb 89 giu kitty then 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:45.070
 probably do this video not 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:48.710
 I shouldn't even do it, but I feel myself 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:53.600
 taken because our channel 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:59.260
 above all, he wants a free person 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:09.530
 exchange of opinions and meanwhile they are there 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:13.970
 these these these these these 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:16.900
 no statements that must be accepted 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.220
 quietly offend others 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.800
 expressing itself is normal because union has 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.410
 right to express yourself if you want 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:28.430
 respect to express yourself then bring 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:30.560
 even to those who express yourself I think it is not 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.660
 so hard 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.280
 with this I repeat that I did not want 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.530
 absolutely sticking 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.710
 no person I think he has not 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:43.280
 done or just wanted to stay 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:46.570
 on the subject and therefore what there is 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.880
 I simply want to say eh 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:52.720
 remember the opinions are always 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:56.540
 accompanied by respect because if not 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:06:02.540
 they are nothing are not opinions are 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:04.690
 just words to baby ok this is 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.690
 all
