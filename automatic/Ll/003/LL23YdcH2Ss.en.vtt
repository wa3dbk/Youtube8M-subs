00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 knew that a third of the world's population 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.720
 directs the left of the road which for 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:13.290
 Brazilians means driving to the 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:15.540
 contrary there is in the report the 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.910
 first country that comes to mind is the 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.130
 England is not because everything started 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.390
 there the English hand became 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.400
 obligatory in 1773 precisely in this 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.980
 when the horse was the only means of 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.510
 of transport to the left 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.850
 was more convenient since the majority 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.190
 people was right-handed and 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.800
 easy the rider will use spear against a 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.079
 from the right up to the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.790
 time to ride the horse is more usual 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.129
 turn left 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.730
 on the other hand in the 18th century in the states 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.739
 United 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.500
 drivers of larger carts 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.379
 they sat on the left to whip the 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.980
 animals with the right hand 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:58.379
 in 1792 in Pennsylvania became worth the 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.020
 first American law determining that 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.730
 the drivers kept the right to 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.530
 Tell this story better, I decided 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.909
 try the right direction 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.460
 but I'm not alone did not bring 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.920
 marcelo journalist of portal brum and the 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.280
 We are collectors of old people. 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.860
 directing this German fusca from 1953 and 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.270
 Let's see who makes the best time 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.820
 Do you think Marcelo is headed? 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.210
 audi r8 err and so on 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.710
 but the right steering wheel like that is never there 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.299
 out in that car that everything the opposite 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.549
 So we have to think exactly 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.470
 so try to drive the way 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.130
 the vehicle is right, and then we're going to 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.930
 well or not 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.060
 Of course, love for reasons is 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.490
 to make everything very sure would be 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.380
 good when we prepare you 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.790
 continues the information on the 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.159
 direction of the 19th century when 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.020
 car models were born 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.759
 initials had a central steering wheel 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.280
 following the example of benz patent 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.070
 motorwagen the world's first car 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.560
 time has passed and every nation 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.270
 adapted to what was more coherent 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.520
 will continue to adopt the 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.830
 transit with the other English hand 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.020
 opted for the right side 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.899
 beyond the uk today this standard 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.240
 in more than 70 countries, many of them 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.850
 colonized by england and that you 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:19.940
 nor imagined as South Africa and New 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.940
 south africa 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.730
 and there we will unravel the curves of the 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:33.360
 lane thinking all the time around 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:35.490
 to see who gets the best in my 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.770
 It's really complicated 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.440
 with the left hand he saw no more is well 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.390
 So far fun in the end 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.310
 The last place was for me. 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.490
 ah but I believe the last will be the 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.490
 first 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.700
 it's hard to make turns in the right 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.410
 that we are the opposite then who 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.850
 to think otherwise keep talking more 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.890
 It's like I already knew the car took 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.020
 advantage clearly not I thought the 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.650
 otherwise and I made sure only that 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.650
 fine
