it's<00:00:08.240> been<00:00:08.480> a<00:00:08.510> little<00:00:08.690> tough<00:00:08.780> on<00:00:09.460> us<00:00:10.460> we<00:00:10.820> hadn't

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:11.059 
it's been a little tough on us we hadn't

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:12.459 
it's been a little tough on us we hadn't
got<00:00:11.150> into<00:00:11.270> some<00:00:11.570> of<00:00:11.660> the<00:00:11.719> rodeos<00:00:12.080> this<00:00:12.260> year

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:12.469 
got into some of the rodeos this year

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:14.110 
got into some of the rodeos this year
because<00:00:12.830> we're<00:00:12.980> worried<00:00:13.370> rookies<00:00:13.790> this<00:00:13.910> year

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.120 
because we're worried rookies this year

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.080 
because we're worried rookies this year
and<00:00:14.860> like<00:00:15.860> you<00:00:16.010> had<00:00:16.160> to<00:00:16.250> have<00:00:16.400> some<00:00:16.610> some<00:00:16.910> money

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
and like you had to have some some money

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.400 
and like you had to have some some money
one<00:00:17.270> from<00:00:17.480> last<00:00:17.630> year<00:00:17.750> whatever<00:00:18.080> site<00:00:18.230> it's

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
one from last year whatever site it's

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.230 
one from last year whatever site it's
it's<00:00:18.830> made<00:00:19.010> it<00:00:19.100> a<00:00:19.130> little<00:00:19.279> tough<00:00:19.550> at<00:00:19.789> the<00:00:19.940> start

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
it's made it a little tough at the start

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.990 
it's made it a little tough at the start
but<00:00:20.449> but<00:00:20.960> now<00:00:21.140> we<00:00:22.130> can<00:00:22.250> get<00:00:22.340> into<00:00:22.400> the<00:00:22.670> rodeos

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
but but now we can get into the rodeos

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.080 
but but now we can get into the rodeos
and<00:00:23.119> stuff<00:00:23.300> now<00:00:23.510> and<00:00:23.540> so<00:00:23.840> we<00:00:24.410> started

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.320 

we've<00:00:30.240> got<00:00:30.390> about<00:00:30.540> 10<00:00:30.900> 5:1<00:00:31.530> right<00:00:31.740> now<00:00:31.890> we're

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.330 
we've got about 10 5:1 right now we're

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.950 
we've got about 10 5:1 right now we're
so<00:00:33.330> I<00:00:33.360> think<00:00:33.780> 16<00:00:34.590> or<00:00:34.770> 15th<00:00:35.160> probably<00:00:35.490> has

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
so I think 16 or 15th probably has

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.780 
so I think 16 or 15th probably has
17,000

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.610 

I<00:00:41.820> think<00:00:42.090> I'm<00:00:42.240> second<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.200> think<00:00:43.410> he's

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
I think I'm second and I think he's

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.630 
I think I'm second and I think he's
second<00:00:44.370> third

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.770 

that's<00:00:50.790> right

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.189 

probably<00:00:56.469> the<00:00:56.559> best<00:00:56.829> thing<00:00:57.100> is<00:00:57.690> not<00:00:58.690> having<00:00:59.110> to
