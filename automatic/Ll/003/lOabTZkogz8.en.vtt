00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
you think about sled dragon what do you

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.440 
you think about sled dragon what do you
think<00:00:13.080> about<00:00:13.190> you<00:00:14.190> think<00:00:14.429> about<00:00:14.549> walking

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
think about you think about walking

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.019 
think about you think about walking
forward<00:00:15.990> with<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.369> you<00:00:17.369> think<00:00:17.580> about<00:00:17.640> walking

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
forward with it you think about walking

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.359 
forward with it you think about walking
backwards<00:00:18.710> you<00:00:19.710> might<00:00:19.859> even<00:00:19.890> think<00:00:20.250> about

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
backwards you might even think about

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.480 
backwards you might even think about
rotational<00:00:21.240> movements<00:00:21.980> I'm<00:00:22.980> about<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.340> show

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
rotational movements I'm about to show

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.420 
rotational movements I'm about to show
you<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.640> variation<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.330> came<00:00:24.539> up<00:00:24.660> with<00:00:25.430> that

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
you a variation I came up with that

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.120 
you a variation I came up with that
totally<00:00:27.080> revolutionizes<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.680> gives<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.099> a

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
totally revolutionizes it gives you a

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.229 
totally revolutionizes it gives you a
whole<00:00:29.460> new<00:00:29.519> dimension<00:00:30.230> for<00:00:31.230> sled<00:00:31.439> dragon<00:00:32.239> now

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
whole new dimension for sled dragon now

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.190 
whole new dimension for sled dragon now
when<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:33.899> look<00:00:34.110> at<00:00:34.260> sport<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.860> linear<00:00:35.640> know

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
when you look at sport is a linear know

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.350 
when you look at sport is a linear know
when<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.260> look<00:00:37.410> at<00:00:37.559> sport<00:00:37.920> can<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.850> patterns

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
when you look at sport can the patterns

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.420 
when you look at sport can the patterns
that<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.750> athletes<00:00:40.170> move<00:00:40.469> can<00:00:41.250> they<00:00:41.370> be

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
that the athletes move can they be

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.049 
that the athletes move can they be
predicted<00:00:42.030> know<00:00:42.239> they're<00:00:43.050> chaotic<00:00:43.850> now<00:00:44.850> once

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
predicted know they're chaotic now once

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.729 
predicted know they're chaotic now once
you<00:00:45.180> look<00:00:45.300> at<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.510> sled<00:00:45.750> dragging<00:00:46.170> variation

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
you look at the sled dragging variation

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.330 
you look at the sled dragging variation
and<00:00:47.489> imagine<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.840> body<00:00:49.050> position<00:00:49.649> what<00:00:50.250> does

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
and imagine the body position what does

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.510 
and imagine the body position what does
it<00:00:50.370> look<00:00:50.610> like<00:00:51.079> does<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.199> look<00:00:52.320> like<00:00:52.559> Barry

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
it look like does it look like Barry

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.920 
it look like does it look like Barry
Sanders<00:00:54.030> cutting

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.680 

okay<00:00:57.860> this<00:00:58.010> it<00:00:58.190> looked<00:00:58.370> like<00:00:58.520> you<00:00:59.270> know<00:00:59.390> a

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
okay this it looked like you know a

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.780 
okay this it looked like you know a
basketball<00:01:00.590> player<00:01:00.740> breaking<00:01:01.280> some<00:01:01.430> ankles

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.110 

yes<00:01:05.380> look<00:01:06.380> at<00:01:06.500> the<00:01:06.590> angle<00:01:06.770> of<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:07.130> ankle<00:01:07.610> knee

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120 
yes look at the angle of the ankle knee

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.100 
yes look at the angle of the ankle knee
the<00:01:08.420> hip<00:01:09.070> what's<00:01:10.070> the<00:01:10.220> body<00:01:10.430> position<00:01:11.110> check

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
the hip what's the body position check

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.200 
the hip what's the body position check
out<00:01:12.230> the<00:01:12.410> sled<00:01:12.680> dragon<00:01:13.040> variation<00:01:13.550> it's

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
out the sled dragon variation it's

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:34.600 
out the sled dragon variation it's
pretty<00:01:14.420> unique

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:48.700
