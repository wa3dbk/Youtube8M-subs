00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.439
 hello good envelopes how are we and you 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.150
 I bring 1 video in which I will teach 

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:07.160
 something less strange is that it has 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.320
 happened today after good I was 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.850
 attacking with pigs like he's doing 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.170
 lately with pigs and such that is the 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.139
 true that being pretty well deformed 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.779
 or the 400,000 over here and for that too 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:19.310
 in short that is not bad and it turns out that in 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:23.779
 an attack 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:26.570
 the king then let's say he does something weird 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.550
 very rare it's worth it then it's about jobs 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.169
 of the Clan Bull and let's see the 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.489
 repetition because it has no waste 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.489
 the mind then 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.960
 is looking for that has enough ebro and 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:43.180
 resources and is semi abandoned by the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.040
 King's attention and the castle has to 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.410
 does not have and not to let go and with barbara 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.720
 up and attentive the king who has just 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.690
 be frozen or is it just 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.210
 stay still 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.500
 without moving or be such that it releases one that 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.969
 was down here to call the queen and 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.469
 the king but the king does not come loose a 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.019
 bar bar has gone what the fuck do seven 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.460
 that is standing there here and I 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.290
 puzzled 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.880
 then I say good then and another 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.640
 barbarian already to see if it goes but no bases already 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.020
 is completely person statue of the 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.359
 Queen 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.340
 as queen I had to do it 

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:17.530
 portal kills the queen 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.479
 and now I release the pigs there we are and 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.799
 good and typical as a cure for 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.920
 one side one healing for the other 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:26.950
 which and the king 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.719
 the king is still with a statue 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.570
 they are destroying the village in their 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:34.150
 noses and Zionism 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.890
 I call him with the hill and then he released 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.010
 barbarians and the guy stays still with 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.920
 a statue says to see why for what 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.720
 I'm moving from my pedestal yes 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.880
 that I'm going to go out 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.580
 Calling the barber wolf and going outside 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.440
 to drop more and now put candle and I'll 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.750
 to die then then I stay here 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.670
 still and so they hurt us if 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.970
 I can prevent them from killing me, better than 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.380
 best 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.479
 then the guy stays shot and you 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.220
 I'm going to do that as well as I'm not and 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.910
 to see if they rise from me and do not hurt me 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.340
 but we'll see now that he's attacking 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.399
 one hundred percent and the king and is still 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.929
 there for the pigs and soft attention 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.380
 pedestal study then now uncle 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.330
 he gets up he wakes up like that 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.040
 dream in which I was say support my 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.930
 less pedestal to write and some 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.520
 noses and this gets up and starts to 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.350
 give the pig but of course with all the 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.950
 pigs there destroy him a moment and 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.950
 there it ends 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.150
 the truth is that it is very rare very strange 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.730
 that is 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.470
 I feel like I'm going to go that values ​​that 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.270
 they're going to fuck me they're going to destroy me for 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.540
 kill him so I do not want that I do not want 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:49.860
 is another average performance is stopped already 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:52.230
 see if staying for one attack me 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:56.330
 they destroy the village a bit and if I do not 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:59.330
 they can kill better but not because I 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.330
 do not 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:10.390
 queen as the city council 80% 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:14.019
 taken equal but that destroys my 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.599
 pedestal and a nose is my pedestal not 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.950
 Nobody destroys it to me so, well, that's what 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.299
 that has passed from the pedestal study and the 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.760
 great uncle, like a beast but 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:26.640
 clear 20 pig well I like that you 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.360
 As it bursts you, we go rafa, there's no 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.220
 other 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.960
 this is all kids and I hope that you 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.940
 I liked it is very strange 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.890
 It is very rare is the first time 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.600
 I see a book of this type in the game and 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.080
