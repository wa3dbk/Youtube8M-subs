00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:23.820
 Often during cornering 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:30.660
 If you hear words such as under hair or oversteer 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:37.990
 I think, but if you know why that is the case , you can take action now 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:41.500
 In this case the accelerator to have run at a constant speed stepping acceleration is also said constant speed 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:48.070
 It is a certain reason angle to cut the handle Te 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:49.000
 Able to understand it is you that it is cornering that post very stable even in wet road surface 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.960
 I think 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.100
 Obtained would at Yeah intends uhh go stepping on the accelerator in such a scene location and f club 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.780
 Hmm 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:01.510
 It means that 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:02.350
 Now handle does not move at all to try one more time have inflated more and more car out 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.489
 Let's go 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.570
 Step on the accelerator 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.570
 I lost my case and lost 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:19.369
 Fe is in It is the so-called understeer that automotive technical bit 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:23.630
 It's not a precise wording , but it often comes out in car magazines and the like 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:27.710
 That's the situation like it is now 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:30.650
 inadvertently stepped on the accelerator, but I'm a good, if you will a constant speed to try one more time 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:35.770
 I 'm going to bulge out of the car and so on 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:37.550
 That's not to say it's back &amp; it's in a state where it bulges out 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:42.760
 It is at this time 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:46.750
 If the car swells a little, you just need to release the accelerator. 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:49.680
 The car will come back naturally to the original cornering line 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.680
 Let's go one more time 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:57.990
 Yes I just stepped on the accelerator and just let it go 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:05.220
 Yes home is back 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:11.130
 Well, it is a car that many people who just make mistakes often fail in this kind of scene 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:12.680
 It is that I cut out the handle just because it bulges outside 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.350
 Let's look 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.860
 During cornering 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:24.420
 I 'm stepping out of the car because I've stepped on the price of the accelerator and it 's a bulging out of the car. 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:28.080
 Even if it cuts out, the frame doesn't respond as I said, let's do it once more 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.370
 I 'm inadvertently stepping on the accelerator while cornering- bloated Clark-- 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.209
 The handle is perfect 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:37.799
 Another car does n't react at all outside 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:39.930
 It is whether is first Why become understeer because the cause of understeer because 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:44.970
 Think and Accel 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.750
 The reason is that the speed is too high, which has been a little too much 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.360
 Because 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:54.670
 At first only the steering wheel operation which was releasing the accelerator 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:57.900
 I did not rely on good cornering a, especially during sports driving 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.900
 Needs a gun
