00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.690
 mature is complicated a little more if 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.960
 we leave as for a jam 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.960

 vinaigrette very simple provided that 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.290
 we make a vinaigrette equal you know is 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.780
 If it's a classic vinaigrette, let's 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.300
 put one of vinegar for three parts of 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.130
 salt or one tablespoon of vinegar per 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.750
 three tablespoons of oil not salt 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.360
 let's go to a friend if I say one thing 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.150

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.620

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.080
 vinegar are you using this 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.420

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.360
 It's fine but let's put a little 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.700
 of three parts of oil I'm going to leave 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.560
 So normally when we're putting 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.710
 the oil we are beating in many 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.350

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.600
 the peppers do not make emulsion 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.330
 it's perfectly fine without any 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.870
