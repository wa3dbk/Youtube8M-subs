00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.020
 and well hello to all is spike 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.369
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.279
 any new video 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.820
 so it's for discovery a 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.930
 htc application a car game 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.369
 unfortunately not slightly 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.260
 unpronounceable mail 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.980
 it will now appear your screen in 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.930
 white so I put the sky tati but I 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.210
 will leave it all because 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.760
 it's slow so here we go 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.579
 start the game has three modes of 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.370
 race elimination playoff mode 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.070
 pardon so it means that all 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.989
 turns the last is eliminated there is the 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.899
 normal race mode ben there it's a 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.590
 banal race so three rounds the first 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.109
 who gets to the 3rd round wins and then the 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.030
 chrono mode chrono mode this is the 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.920
 chrono so you have to break the record 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.850
 of the round to win the race 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.960
 we will start hop we will start everything 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:15.110
 immediately from the death of chrono 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:17.180
 so here's his load a little bit 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.340
 so 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.170
 that's it before I do anything 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.080
 First, I 'll show you how to handle 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.700
 so in alain tilt commands 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.670
 automatic gasoline that is to say that 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:32.060
 you do not have to do anything he's ahead he 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.320
 brake only manual inclination so 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.910
 there you have to turn your phone 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.050
 in gasoline and press 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.540
 accelerator and brake 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.890
 how to touch automatic gasoline so 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.470
 there it's the arrows to turn and 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.330
 for he advances alone you have to 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.950
 just Rennes and how to touch 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.610
 of manual gasoline so there you have to 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.020
 turn with the arrows and accelerate and 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.940
 to brake with the penal ones so me it's 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.869
 the mode that I personally prefer 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:59.690
 so here we are going to make you a little 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.390
 turn in stopwatch mode for you for 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:07.100
 make you see what it's going to do so 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.649
 that's it yes also think to tell me what 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.420
 you think of the new overlay so if 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.100
 you do not know what it's like 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.020
 small edges that you see there 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.730
 now on the video 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.670
 that would make me happy that you 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.860
 know that I know what you're doing 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.110
 forgive me forgive me there is 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.650
 slightly late so I could but he's 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.690
 all clear so I also took advantage of this 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.460
 moment to tell you that I'm going out 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.160
 a little less two videos than usual 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.110
 but I will try really found 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.350
 great trick if you see what I want 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.930
 say 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.510
 before I went out maybe videos or 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.590
 more even less work while here 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.070
 I'm really going to try to make a 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.280
 maximum for it to be good and ben 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.620
 so here is the music I know absolutely 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.459
 not tell you this several emmy 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.870
 but if you look so in 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.030
 description of the video you have some 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.900
 music titles that I use it's 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.849
 yet handy and know 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.069
 so yes I forgot to specify as 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.439
 me youtube and flash there a fake boost 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.599
 skid so that sledding down 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:14.000
 increase and you can use 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:16.159
 the boost so here I went for a ride 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.359
 I have a little delay it does not matter 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:22.430
 will immediately go to the mode we are going 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:25.010
 see this so either normal or is 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.730
 eliminatory so we will go to the mode 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.650
 normal 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.959
 so it's quite the same circuit 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.959
 for the three races it's not great 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.450
 so we'll change that's normal mode on 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.010
 another circuit 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.159
 at least it'll make a little gameplay 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.290
 richer 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:48.200
 so we'll start right away 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:51.260
 2 yes if you click now so on 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.359
 the pretty little lady to banished if you 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.909
 click on the screen now you'll see 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:57.200
 my video because I just started a team 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:00.019
 on android 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.970
 so the conditions to go in and everything 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.209
 it's now clicking on the screen to 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.209
 the man 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.080
 so 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.730
 as you see the normal mode must 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.450
 just be first 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.650
 and must win no matter what I have not 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.009
 other 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.419
 advice to give you yes shred them 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:23.030
 only when it is necessary because 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:25.250
 that otherwise you lose place of 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.289
 places sorry for the rankings so like 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.580
 you see here offers manageable ways 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:29.120
 will gilera to make me a nice little 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.669
 skid 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.100
 yes I skid to make a bouquet of 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:37.990
 the march not strong French but it's 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.990
 no serious words you understood me 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:44.040
 we will start a little bit knowing 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.040
 after that I have to introduce the mode 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.040
 playoff 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:52.439
 so here we go 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:54.389
 you've seen a little fashion run the 

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:56.699
 opponents level etc 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:59.999
 we will immediately go to the mode 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:00.599
 playoffs no I do not want to post my 

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:04.409
 progression 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:07.529
 here is the playoff mode which race I 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:10.169
 want to take a walk to show you that 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:12.749
 the last one will be eliminated while trying 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:14.639
 being last to prove your so that 

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:18.209
 we are well eliminated by being last 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.889
 and then after that I'll leave you in 

00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:25.480
 here 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:27.910
 so here's go 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:30.730
 if I remember correctly unfortunately 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:34.110
 I have already done the chrono on this 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.110
 circuit you will excuse me 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.430
 I did not pay attention and I just 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.520
 launch I realized that 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:43.880
 it was this circuit there so I'm going 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:46.420
 keep moving forward just while 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.420
 being last 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:53.820
 an agreement with behind me everything is 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:55.680
 really long will go by and how he 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.080
 must say that the guy rolls 90 miles 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:01.979
 by the hour in the race may need 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.920
 explained that it's not too small 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:06.110
 health walk 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.240
 here is the best game to speed up 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.300
 without going beyond 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.300
 2 

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.680
 that's more so I thought about telling myself 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.620

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.360
