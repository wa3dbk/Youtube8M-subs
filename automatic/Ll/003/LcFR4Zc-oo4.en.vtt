00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:04.950
 yes, I am vinícius 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.660
 This is my comic book and mine. 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.059
 Friends release will hit the pews 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.010
 so they should be commented on in this 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.719
 please excuse my voice 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.309
 I sick subject today are the 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.500
 two origins of wolverine 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.880
 one being the Salvatti and I think 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.130
 which has not yet reached the stands of all 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.080
 Brazil, I think the river is only São Paulo. 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.670
 some states and another by the panini that 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.619
 arrived yesterday in porto alegre 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.869
 we started with wolverine origin number 1 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.940
 originally published in 2001 as a 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.030
 miniseries in six editions bovidino 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.780
 origin is to tell the origin of the bo 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.610
 né 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.829
 finally this generated much controversy at the time 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.600
 that she left until today has readers who 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.730
 I gave this story because many 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.219
 fans felt that the great grace of the 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.800
 It is precisely this not knowing the 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.410
 His past but I enjoyed it, I thought it was cool. 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.289
 it basically deals with childhood 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.789
 from the long to the beginning of adolescence 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:59.579
 shows how he lived a full family 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.079
 of dark secrets and I can not 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.550
 talk much more so as not to ruin the 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.799
 surprise that they have in the first 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.689
 serious issues I think wolverine origin 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.939
 a very well built story 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.950
 I do not treat the reader as Buster soap 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.170
 stay explaining everything does not have everything 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.939
 it makes a lot of room for 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.799
 You have to interpret things. 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.900
 seeing something until I did not wait for 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.939
 a story so immense in know how to bounce 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.500
 telling the origin of the wolverine not a 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.090
 of the most popular characters in 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.830
 comics and the guys instead of doing 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.110
 something obvious they tried to build 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.170
 something this is a fan of the character and 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.509
 I did not want to know where he ignores and 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.640
 ignore the final volume has forgotten everything 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.799
 then even the creative team behind 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.869
 the defense who she is very good 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.970
 the story was originally conceived 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.700
 the bill gems in partnership with joe 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.689
 question and the script is the jacques people 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.729
 who is a guy who already wrote a 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.829
 miniseries of humans that what I think 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.320
 and other art and Cambria with equity 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.970
 the colors of Richard and 19 table now to 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.219
 People already said good things, let's go to a 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.100
 comic and useless good old man 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.229
 Serious number 2 is a comic and useless is 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.689
 a story that goes from nowhere to place 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.310
 no call this source is slutty 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.110
 with the reader it is no wonder that there 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.179
 United States the people hated when 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.580
 it went well marvel was not satisfied 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.410
 and decided to continue the limbo 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.470
 wolverine 13 years 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.300
 because the origin is not government and did it 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.070
 with a creative team completely 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.620
 different the scripts are from I want one 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.390
 bad day and art is donated a pocketknife that 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.860
 sick brother cameras who designed the 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.810
 first miniseries there the colorist 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.520
 also changed is frank martin but the 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.500
 people are still very good I think the 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.960
 drawings are not the problem of history 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.340
 it starts very seriously when 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.800
 I was going to first issue, I thought so. 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.690
 Wow, I'm reading a new classic, she 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.150
 shows the wolverine living in the middle of 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.280
 wolves having to hunt to eat 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.380
 there suddenly appears a polar bear in the 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.060
 middle of the place where you are living until 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.800
 remembered a little lost and finished 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.660
 something terrible is happening only in the 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.610
 sequence soon in edition number 2 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.530
 the barter story for a plot like this 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.450
 the useless man appears the sinister in the 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.390
 story he's wanting to capture the 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.220
 wolverine and studying his biotype ends 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.530
 appearing also a girl who 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.060
 worries about wolverine who help him 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.920
 that in the end they do not reveal 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.510
 absolutely nothing 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.760
 in the origin of the wolverine then why 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.590
 source title is another reason 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.370
 this bound is a bitch with the 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.020
 reader 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.670
 if you go to see it against cover says 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.310
 what is presented the first 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.690
 meeting of the film with a man called 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.700
 believe 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.050
 Then you think of who, anyway, I will not go 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.880
 speak no more not to ruin 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.990
 no surprise although he found a 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.040
 very bad picture 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.600
 I think it's not legal to ruin the 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.280
 your experience is the best of everything 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.950
 by the way the story ends 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.950
 we will probably have wolverine origin 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.240
 number 3 to stay the recommendation is not 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.820
 It's amazing how the guys got it. 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.590
 To err on such a beautiful cover looks like this 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.940
 Bound it's not like the guy does not 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.709
 have an interest in buying when you see 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.170
 look banking this is the back of the 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.420
 back I hear that is an origin of vm 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.010
 seek to pick up original miniseries that 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.390
 is being salvatti or even 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.190
 look for elma chips which I think is a 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.930
 origin even more interesting than 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.950
 These are my dude, I feel better. 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.950
 now that I've unbuttoned 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.560
 good people this really i hope 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.060

 about marvel and with daniel hdr the people 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.459
 sought to explain what consisted of 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.530
 this process that has revolutionized 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.850
 comic 60s created by 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.530
