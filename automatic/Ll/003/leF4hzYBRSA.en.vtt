00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 simone velasco as you discovered the bce 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.680
 at what age you started running 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.500
 well the bike was the discovery that I was still 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.380
 very young I was about five years old 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.540
 because my dad was running with the 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.699
 mountain bike amateurs and then unfortunately 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.920
 when she stopped I moved away 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.130
 for quite a few years I started that 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.810
 I was 15 and mountain first 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.539
 bike and or do the seasons on the mountain 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.580
 bike and then I passed 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.320
 the road achieved excellent results 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.870
 and now I am in this very great 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.880
 team that the zalf and come on I am 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.579
 behaving quite well and we will try 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.010
 not to stop here and to coordinate 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.989
 going further and further it arises who it was 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.930
 your idol when you were a child 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:50.700
 well I remember the great mark 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:53.730
 swamps with sticking on the climbs gave 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.879
 an incredible emotion but now it is 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.980
 nibali my say our pupil 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.199
 what do you like about cycling that 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.409
 plays vincenzo nibali 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.290
 well it always runs to the attack and it doesn't 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.700
 only go fast uphill but 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.250
 it goes strong even in time trial and downhill 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.049
 which here are excellent qualities because 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.770
 in cycling from today we must excel 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.630

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.500
 between all 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.979
 well the wind triptych was one 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.600
 fantastic victory because it was more 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.299
 a team victory not just one 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.670

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.040
 support to all my companions indeed 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.560
 I dedicated it to them and it really was 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.350
 one of the most beautiful victories the race 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.259
 that one day you would dream of winning well 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.110
 for an Italian the tour of Italy is 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:48.390
 always the tour of italy what also 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.979
 there are world championships 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.829
 too many that I would like to win in the meantime 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.850

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.500

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.399
 florence a day that has not gone 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.799
 very well, in short, an experience that 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.590
 will bring into the heart both an experience and 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.479
 I will carry in my heart a great emotion and 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.940
 just wear the national team shirt 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.130

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.190
 who are the chills and then 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.620
 even in a world championship at home with 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.720
 all the people who do it for you 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.210
 it was a fantastic emotion and I hope 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.800
 to be able to repeat it if you want what it is 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.330
 what do you feel for cycling when 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.090
 riding a bicycle 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:30.680
 well for me cycling is everything I try 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:33.830
 freedom and I like to suffer and feel the 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.490
 fatigue and let's get excited when I hear 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.620
 these things 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.450
 we want to give the boys advice 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.840
 that today the bicycle is approaching 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:45.020
 well a piece of advice I'm still young 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.990
 but the only thing I can say to do 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:51.350
 what he likes and to ride a bike 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.350
 when they want not to spare themselves and to 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.600
 always continue on the road of the 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.830
 running clean and why a cycling 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.830
 the future is clean
