an alternative little strike but

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.610 
an alternative little strike but
definitely<00:02:44.110> as<00:02:44.200> a<00:02:44.230> good<00:02:44.470> all-around

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
definitely as a good all-around

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.740 
definitely as a good all-around
cricketer<00:02:45.460> especially<00:02:46.060> when<00:02:46.210> you<00:02:46.330> go<00:02:46.450> to<00:02:46.510> some

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
cricketer especially when you go to some

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.560 
cricketer especially when you go to some
continent<00:02:47.670> playing<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.790> good<00:02:48.940> spin<00:02:49.180> is<00:02:49.330> there

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
continent playing the good spin is there

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.500 
continent playing the good spin is there
a<00:02:49.810> sweep<00:02:50.620> I<00:02:50.920> would<00:02:51.250> say<00:02:51.430> is<00:02:51.490> essential<00:02:52.120> because

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
a sweep I would say is essential because

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.750 
a sweep I would say is essential because
some<00:02:52.990> players<00:02:53.200> don't<00:02:53.410> player<00:02:53.680> but<00:02:54.010> I<00:02:54.340> think

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
some players don't player but I think

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.300 
some players don't player but I think
you<00:02:54.880> develop<00:02:55.870> into<00:02:56.200> a<00:02:56.230> much<00:02:56.440> better<00:02:56.680> player<00:02:57.070> if

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
you develop into a much better player if

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.949 
you develop into a much better player if
you<00:02:57.430> do<00:02:57.610> have<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.880> sweep<00:02:58.150> in<00:02:58.330> your<00:02:58.480> repertoire

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
you do have the sweep in your repertoire

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.440 
you do have the sweep in your repertoire
and<00:02:59.320> it's<00:02:59.650> harder<00:02:59.920> to<00:02:59.950> ball<00:03:00.160> against<00:03:00.640> and<00:03:01.300> it

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
and it's harder to ball against and it

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.850 
and it's harder to ball against and it
creates<00:03:01.780> a<00:03:01.900> hearing<00:03:02.530> for<00:03:02.740> the<00:03:02.890> captain<00:03:03.280> and

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
creates a hearing for the captain and

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.520 
creates a hearing for the captain and
what<00:03:05.860> about<00:03:06.130> situations<00:03:07.030> where<00:03:07.120> a<00:03:07.720> spin<00:03:08.380> and

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
what about situations where a spin and

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.440 
what about situations where a spin and
bowling<00:03:08.890> really<00:03:09.190> well<00:03:09.340> are<00:03:09.489> here<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:09.880> you<00:03:10.300> get

bowling really well are here and you get
a<00:03:10.510> bit<00:03:10.690> bogged<00:03:10.930> down<00:03:11.080> but<00:03:11.590> you've<00:03:11.739> got<00:03:12.070> a<00:03:12.100> start

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
a bit bogged down but you've got a start

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.390 
a bit bogged down but you've got a start
scoring<00:03:13.390> what<00:03:14.380> sort<00:03:14.650> of<00:03:14.709> thoughts<00:03:14.980> would<00:03:15.220> you

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:14.770 
what would be the best way to practice
those<00:04:11.780> sort<00:04:11.989> of<00:04:12.049> go-to<00:04:12.230> shots<00:04:12.739> I<00:04:13.239> think<00:04:14.239> it

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
those sort of go-to shots I think it

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.870 
those sort of go-to shots I think it
depends<00:04:15.290> what<00:04:15.920> you've<00:04:16.100> got<00:04:16.280> at<00:04:16.400> your<00:04:16.519> disposal

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
depends what you've got at your disposal

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.449 
depends what you've got at your disposal
if<00:04:17.630> you've<00:04:17.810> got<00:04:17.989> a<00:04:18.019> bowling<00:04:18.410> machine<00:04:18.530> whether

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
if you've got a bowling machine whether

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.550 
if you've got a bowling machine whether
you<00:04:19.609> got<00:04:19.729> bowlers<00:04:20.239> when<00:04:20.630> you<00:04:20.750> really<00:04:21.410> got<00:04:21.500> a

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
you got bowlers when you really got a

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.950 
you got bowlers when you really got a
good<00:04:21.739> outside<00:04:22.100> neck<00:04:22.660> situation<00:04:23.660> where<00:04:23.900> you

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
good outside neck situation where you

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.440 
good outside neck situation where you
can<00:04:24.110> rough<00:04:24.320> up<00:04:24.470> the<00:04:24.620> surface<00:04:25.150> just<00:04:26.150> trying<00:04:26.389> to

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
can rough up the surface just trying to

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.430 
can rough up the surface just trying to
be<00:04:26.539> adaptable<00:04:26.990> but<00:04:27.830> and<00:04:28.990> and<00:04:29.990> then<00:04:30.169> just

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
be adaptable but and and then just

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.129 
be adaptable but and and then just
experiment<00:04:31.370> see<00:04:31.760> what<00:04:31.910> works<00:04:32.090> for<00:04:32.210> you<00:04:32.419> you

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
experiment see what works for you you

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.040 
experiment see what works for you you
know<00:04:33.260> the<00:04:33.470> pickups<00:04:33.860> week<00:04:34.100> for<00:04:34.490> inside<00:04:35.300> are<00:04:35.990> two

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
just try and work out maybe all the

just try and work out maybe all the
shots<00:04:40.880> you<00:04:41.150> know<00:04:41.750> going<00:04:41.990> over<00:04:42.229> my<00:04:42.470> week<00:04:42.650> ago

shots you know going over my week ago
now<00:04:43.160> be<00:04:43.280> extra<00:04:43.639> sweet<00:04:43.820> big<00:04:44.120> maybe<00:04:44.630> you<00:04:44.780> can

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
now be extra sweet big maybe you can

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.930 
now be extra sweet big maybe you can
play<00:04:45.110> them<00:04:45.260> but<00:04:45.950> try<00:04:46.160> and<00:04:46.220> work<00:04:46.400> out<00:04:46.520> for<00:04:46.760> you

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
play them but try and work out for you

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.350 
play them but try and work out for you
what<00:04:47.930> shot<00:04:48.320> is<00:04:48.470> best<00:04:48.740> but<00:04:49.490> experiment<00:04:50.150> in<00:04:50.270> the

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
what shot is best but experiment in the

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.779 
what shot is best but experiment in the
knees<00:04:50.570> and<00:04:51.410> and<00:04:51.770> do<00:04:51.950> a<00:04:51.979> lot<00:04:52.220> of<00:04:52.250> it<00:04:52.460> because<00:04:52.550> the

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:52.789 
knees and and do a lot of it because the

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:56.890 
knees and and do a lot of it because the
best<00:04:53.000> plays<00:04:54.760> they<00:04:55.760> do<00:04:55.820> a<00:04:55.970> lot<00:04:56.150> of<00:04:56.210> drills<00:04:56.570> and

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
best plays they do a lot of drills and

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.850 
best plays they do a lot of drills and
so<00:04:57.530> they<00:04:57.680> know<00:04:57.889> when<00:04:58.669> it<00:04:58.760> comes<00:04:58.970> to<00:04:59.150> a<00:04:59.180> game<00:04:59.860> if

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
so they know when it comes to a game if

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.710 
so they know when it comes to a game if
the<00:05:01.039> pressures<00:05:01.430> on<00:05:01.580> they<00:05:01.789> can<00:05:02.030> execute<00:05:02.360> there

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
the pressures on they can execute there

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.150 
the pressures on they can execute there
probably<00:05:03.080> but<00:05:03.349> they've<00:05:03.500> done<00:05:03.680> the<00:05:03.800> hard<00:05:03.830> work

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
probably but they've done the hard work

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.969 
probably but they've done the hard work
in<00:05:04.340> the<00:05:04.370> net<00:05:04.690> and<00:05:05.690> sort<00:05:06.349> of<00:05:06.380> final<00:05:06.650> question

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
in the net and sort of final question

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:08.800 
in the net and sort of final question
and<00:05:07.130> what<00:05:07.639> are<00:05:07.700> your<00:05:07.820> thoughts<00:05:08.000> on<00:05:08.150> on<00:05:08.389> reverse

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.050 
and what are your thoughts on on reverse
sweep<00:05:09.110> or<00:05:09.380> the<00:05:10.070> switch<00:05:10.310> hit<00:05:10.520> we've<00:05:10.760> seen<00:05:10.940> that

sweep or the switch hit we've seen that

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.969 
sweep or the switch hit we've seen that
quite<00:05:11.270> a<00:05:11.300> bit<00:05:11.360> in<00:05:11.620> particularly<00:05:12.620> one-day

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
quite a bit in particularly one-day

quite a bit in particularly one-day
cricket<00:05:13.130> a<00:05:13.550> lot<00:05:13.880> of<00:05:14.000> kids<00:05:14.240> watch<00:05:14.720> television

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
cricket a lot of kids watch television

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.589 
cricket a lot of kids watch television
will<00:05:15.380> try<00:05:15.889> to<00:05:15.950> mimic<00:05:16.160> those<00:05:16.490> shots<00:05:16.789> do<00:05:17.510> you

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:17.599 
will try to mimic those shots do you

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:18.940 
will try to mimic those shots do you
think<00:05:17.780> they're<00:05:17.930> productive<00:05:18.229> shots<00:05:18.680> or<00:05:18.830> do<00:05:18.889> you

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 
think they're productive shots or do you

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.909 
think they're productive shots or do you
think<00:05:18.979> the<00:05:19.160> shots<00:05:19.370> that<00:05:19.520> aren't<00:05:19.849> necessary<00:05:20.919> no

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
think the shots that aren't necessary no

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.010 
think the shots that aren't necessary no
I<00:05:21.950> think<00:05:22.070> they're<00:05:22.340> very<00:05:22.550> productive<00:05:22.970> and<00:05:23.630> I

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
I think they're very productive and I

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.850 
I think they're very productive and I
think<00:05:24.349> if<00:05:24.440> you<00:05:24.560> can<00:05:24.710> execute<00:05:25.070> them

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
think if you can execute them

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.100 
think if you can execute them
brilliant<00:05:26.460> but<00:05:26.879> maybe<00:05:27.090> it's<00:05:27.389> not<00:05:27.539> for<00:05:27.750> you<00:05:27.870> and

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
brilliant but maybe it's not for you and

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.779 
brilliant but maybe it's not for you and
that's<00:05:28.169> something<00:05:28.710> you<00:05:28.919> gotta<00:05:29.099> work<00:05:29.580> up

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:29.789 
that's something you gotta work up

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:32.029 
that's something you gotta work up
yourself<00:05:30.270> but<00:05:30.569> obviously<00:05:31.439> the<00:05:31.620> more<00:05:31.770> shots

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 
yourself but obviously the more shots

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:35.510 
yourself but obviously the more shots
you<00:05:32.159> got<00:05:32.189> the<00:05:32.729> harder<00:05:33.860> you<00:05:34.860> are<00:05:35.039> to<00:05:35.250> ball

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
you got the harder you are to ball

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.429 
you got the harder you are to ball
against<00:05:36.000> but<00:05:36.599> at<00:05:36.659> the<00:05:36.750> same<00:05:36.960> time<00:05:37.199> you<00:05:37.379> don't

00:05:37.429 --> 00:05:37.439 
against but at the same time you don't

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:39.409 
against but at the same time you don't
want<00:05:37.530> to<00:05:37.680> over<00:05:37.830> complicate<00:05:38.159> things<00:05:38.580> if<00:05:39.210> you

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
want to over complicate things if you

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:41.959 
want to over complicate things if you
can<00:05:39.629> play<00:05:39.900> like<00:05:40.349> Ricky<00:05:40.650> Ponting<00:05:40.860> who<00:05:41.310> doesn't

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:41.969 
can play like Ricky Ponting who doesn't

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:44.149 
can play like Ricky Ponting who doesn't
really<00:05:42.090> play<00:05:42.300> the<00:05:42.509> sweep<00:05:42.750> and<00:05:42.870> score<00:05:43.740> hundreds

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:44.159 
really play the sweep and score hundreds

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:45.920 
really play the sweep and score hundreds
with<00:05:44.430> Arthur<00:05:44.729> sweet<00:05:44.939> then<00:05:45.330> great

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
with Arthur sweet then great

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.110 
with Arthur sweet then great
but<00:05:46.349> if<00:05:46.590> you're<00:05:46.860> a<00:05:46.889> lesser<00:05:47.099> platinum<00:05:47.759> and<00:05:47.969> you

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
but if you're a lesser platinum and you

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.939 
but if you're a lesser platinum and you
need<00:05:48.270> to<00:05:48.419> score<00:05:48.629> in<00:05:48.719> other<00:05:48.870> areas<00:05:49.199> you<00:05:49.830> know<00:05:49.919> I

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:49.949 
need to score in other areas you know I

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:51.110 
need to score in other areas you know I
think<00:05:50.009> that's<00:05:50.219> something<00:05:50.729> you've<00:05:50.849> got<00:05:51.000> to

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
think that's something you've got to

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.140 
think that's something you've got to
work<00:05:51.689> out<00:05:51.840> for<00:05:51.990> yourself<00:05:52.460> what<00:05:53.460> one<00:05:53.729> message

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
work out for yourself what one message

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.749 
work out for yourself what one message
would<00:05:54.300> you<00:05:54.360> give<00:05:54.659> to<00:05:54.689> any<00:05:55.530> young<00:05:56.250> bass<00:05:56.520> when

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:56.759 
would you give to any young bass when

00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:58.610 
would you give to any young bass when
watching<00:05:56.939> this<00:05:57.180> now<00:05:57.419> who<00:05:57.750> wants<00:05:58.259> to<00:05:58.379> learn<00:05:58.500> how
