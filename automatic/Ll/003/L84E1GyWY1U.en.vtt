00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
his when it's on the other side of

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.709 
his when it's on the other side of
course<00:00:36.030> he's<00:00:36.239> not<00:00:36.329> turning<00:00:36.570> around<00:00:36.840> right

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:43.940

there<00:00:40.309> and<00:00:41.360> he<00:00:42.360> also<00:00:42.510> has<00:00:42.870> Popeye<00:00:43.410> going<00:00:43.739> on

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
there and he also has Popeye going on

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.090 
there and he also has Popeye going on
and<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.730> think<00:00:46.760> started<00:00:47.760> pine<00:00:48.059> cutting<00:00:48.890> so<00:00:49.890> he's

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
and I think started pine cutting so he's

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.240 
and I think started pine cutting so he's
been<00:00:50.250> moved<00:00:50.460> out<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.270> main<00:00:51.449> tank<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.590> into

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
been moved out of the main tank and into

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.340 
been moved out of the main tank and into
quarantine<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.539> really<00:00:54.750> do<00:00:54.899> think<00:00:54.930> that

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
quarantine and I really do think that

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.170 
quarantine and I really do think that
his<00:00:56.149> bacterial<00:00:57.149> issues<00:00:57.510> were<00:00:58.410> caused<00:00:58.649> by<00:00:58.980> the

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
his bacterial issues were caused by the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.590 
his bacterial issues were caused by the
the<00:01:00.180> wind<00:01:01.399> and<00:01:02.399> my<00:01:03.210> big<00:01:03.930> telescope<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.890> Calico

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
the wind and my big telescope the Calico

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.450 
the wind and my big telescope the Calico
she<00:01:06.600> did<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.110> him<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.439> accident

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
catch it really really quickly and I

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.370 
catch it really really quickly and I
think<00:02:41.870> with<00:02:42.380> him<00:02:42.710> I<00:02:43.990> really<00:02:44.990> could<00:02:45.200> not<00:02:45.320> have

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
think with him I really could not have

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.950 
think with him I really could not have
caught<00:02:45.710> it<00:02:45.740> any<00:02:45.980> sooner

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.590 

my<00:02:50.960> last<00:02:51.200> fish<00:02:51.700> she<00:02:52.700> drops<00:02:52.970> it<00:02:53.120> overnight<00:02:53.570> and

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
she's fully coming home she didn't have

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.230 
she's fully coming home she didn't have
a<00:02:57.820> good<00:02:59.920> outcome<00:03:00.920> from<00:03:01.370> that<00:03:01.430> one<00:03:01.790> and

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
a good outcome from that one and

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:12.150 
a good outcome from that one and
unfortunately<00:03:03.110> he<00:03:03.980> is<00:03:04.280> her<00:03:04.520> mate

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160
