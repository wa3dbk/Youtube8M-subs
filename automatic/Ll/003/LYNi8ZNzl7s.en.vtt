00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
one inch flat iron which is a ceramic

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.950 
one inch flat iron which is a ceramic
and<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.380> have<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.740> on<00:01:53.329> 360<00:01:54.329> I'm<00:01:54.479> not<00:01:54.659> sure<00:01:54.810> if<00:01:54.869> you

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
and I have it on 360 I'm not sure if you

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.389 
and I have it on 360 I'm not sure if you
can<00:01:55.140> see<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.470> because<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.009> blue<00:01:56.189> light

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
can see that because of the blue light

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.969 
can see that because of the blue light
but<00:01:56.969> it's<00:01:57.090> on<00:01:57.210> 360<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:58.049> it's<00:01:58.170> not<00:01:58.320> even<00:01:58.590> on<00:01:58.740> the

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
but it's on 360 so it's not even on the

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.679 
but it's on 360 so it's not even on the
highest<00:01:59.570> temperature<00:02:00.570> at<00:02:00.810> all<00:02:01.640> if<00:02:02.640> flat<00:02:03.299> irons

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
highest temperature at all if flat irons

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.560 
highest temperature at all if flat irons
really<00:02:04.259> well<00:02:04.439> like<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.100> hell<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.969> really

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
really well like the hell that is really

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.109 
really well like the hell that is really
really<00:02:06.750> well<00:02:07.020> if<00:02:07.290> not<00:02:07.979> it's<00:02:08.369> human<00:02:08.879> hair<00:02:08.910> so

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
really well if not it's human hair so

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.900 
really well if not it's human hair so
it's<00:02:09.420> not<00:02:09.569> one<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.649> guess<00:02:11.069> it's<00:02:11.280> human<00:02:11.640> blend

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
it's not one I guess it's human blend

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.790 
it's not one I guess it's human blend
but<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.450> feels<00:02:13.110> like<00:02:13.319> you

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
but it feels like you

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.970 
but it feels like you
