00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.520 
right now and 10 what I want to move
them<00:01:25.710> but<00:01:25.890> it's<00:01:26.759> going<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:26.970> take<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.240> long<00:01:27.500> so<00:01:28.500> I

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
them but it's going to take so long so I

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.859 
them but it's going to take so long so I
guess<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.520> really<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.970> just<00:01:30.000> shows<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.509> hand

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
guess this really it just shows the hand

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.580 
guess this really it just shows the hand
so<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.350> covers<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.250> hands<00:01:33.110> so<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.140> guess<00:01:34.470> you

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
so it covers the hands so I guess you

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.469
