at one point and say you want to change

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.569 
at one point and say you want to change
it<00:02:41.230> to<00:02:41.349> red<00:02:41.379> it<00:02:41.709> actually<00:02:42.040> changes<00:02:42.459> the

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
it to red it actually changes the

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.910 
it to red it actually changes the
dynamic<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:43.629> we'll<00:02:43.810> show<00:02:44.019> that<00:02:44.260> on<00:02:44.409> the<00:02:44.440> final

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
dynamic and we'll show that on the final

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.420 
dynamic and we'll show that on the final
video<00:02:45.549> that<00:02:45.849> we<00:02:45.940> do<00:02:46.379> we<00:02:47.379> have<00:02:47.590> these<00:02:47.799> three

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
video that we do we have these three
