00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.449 
finally onwards slice and dice let's say
I'm<00:02:28.270> doing<00:02:28.570> 60<00:02:29.140> miles<00:02:29.380> per<00:02:29.620> hour<00:02:29.770> I'm<00:02:30.040> doing

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
I'm doing 60 miles per hour I'm doing

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.430 
I'm doing 60 miles per hour I'm doing
100<00:02:30.910> kilometres<00:02:31.180> per<00:02:31.450> hour<00:02:31.600> which<00:02:32.080> we<00:02:32.290> know

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
100 kilometres per hour which we know

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.980 
100 kilometres per hour which we know
beforehand<00:02:33.010> at<00:02:33.160> 60<00:02:33.580> miles<00:02:33.760> per<00:02:33.910> hour<00:02:34.150> how<00:02:34.930> do

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
beforehand at 60 miles per hour how do

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.600 
beforehand at 60 miles per hour how do
you<00:02:35.110> convert<00:02:35.470> that<00:02:36.030> simple<00:02:37.030> you<00:02:37.560> take<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:39.070> 60

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
you convert that simple you take the 60

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.730 
you convert that simple you take the 60
there<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.360> 100<00:02:40.959> and<00:02:41.170> then<00:02:42.160> remove<00:02:42.790> half<00:02:43.180> of<00:02:43.330> it

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
there the 100 and then remove half of it

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.440 
there the 100 and then remove half of it
cut<00:02:44.740> it<00:02:44.860> in<00:02:45.010> half<00:02:45.040> that's<00:02:45.520> the<00:02:45.760> slice<00:02:46.030> parts

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
cut it in half that's the slice parts

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.670 
cut it in half that's the slice parts
then<00:02:46.900> it<00:02:47.110> becomes<00:02:47.410> 50<00:02:47.830> and<00:02:48.750> then<00:02:49.750> you<00:02:50.410> take

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
then it becomes 50 and then you take

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.729 
then it becomes 50 and then you take
depth<00:02:51.040> 100<00:02:51.730> do<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.660> dice<00:02:52.870> which<00:02:53.230> is<00:02:53.410> removed

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
depth 100 do the dice which is removed

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.300 
depth 100 do the dice which is removed
the<00:02:53.890> last<00:02:54.130> digit<00:02:55.030> so<00:02:55.930> get<00:02:56.170> 10<00:02:56.440> instead<00:02:56.860> of<00:02:56.950> 100

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
the last digit so get 10 instead of 100

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.970 
the last digit so get 10 instead of 100
and<00:02:57.459> Yvette's<00:02:57.970> to<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.300> previous<00:02:58.690> number<00:02:59.050> so

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
and Yvette's to the previous number so

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.360 
and Yvette's to the previous number so
that's<00:03:00.190> 10<00:03:00.489> plus<00:03:00.790> 50<00:03:01.239> that's<00:03:01.510> 60<00:03:02.190> sounds<00:03:03.190> a<00:03:03.250> bit

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
that's 10 plus 50 that's 60 sounds a bit

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.170 
that's 10 plus 50 that's 60 sounds a bit
complicated<00:03:03.850> but<00:03:04.269> it's<00:03:04.420> not<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:05.890> this<00:03:06.760> ok

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
complicated but it's not and this ok

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.120 
complicated but it's not and this ok
this<00:03:07.330> is<00:03:07.480> not<00:03:07.600> the<00:03:07.750> correct<00:03:07.900> way<00:03:08.320> obviously

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
this is not the correct way obviously

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.009 
this is not the correct way obviously
but<00:03:09.880> it's<00:03:10.150> close<00:03:10.600> enough<00:03:10.630> for<00:03:10.870> government

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
but it's close enough for government

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.020 
but it's close enough for government
work<00:03:11.500> doesn't<00:03:12.190> really<00:03:12.430> matter<00:03:12.670> if<00:03:12.880> you're

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
work doesn't really matter if you're

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.180 
work doesn't really matter if you're
going<00:03:13.180> 61<00:03:13.780> or<00:03:13.930> 62<00:03:14.230> miles<00:03:14.530> per<00:03:14.680> hour<00:03:14.800> does<00:03:15.070> it

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
going 61 or 62 miles per hour does it

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.900 
going 61 or 62 miles per hour does it
and<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:16.180> actual<00:03:16.420> figure<00:03:16.810> is<00:03:16.840> like<00:03:17.340> 59.8<00:03:18.340> this

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
and the actual figure is like 59.8 this

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.910 
and the actual figure is like 59.8 this
is<00:03:19.060> a<00:03:19.090> very<00:03:19.209> good<00:03:19.510> present<00:03:20.080> approximation<00:03:20.290> I

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
is a very good present approximation I

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.660 
is a very good present approximation I
know<00:03:20.980> from<00:03:21.220> experience

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.400 

for<00:03:24.670> example<00:03:25.090> let's<00:03:25.209> say<00:03:25.599> I'm<00:03:25.810> doing<00:03:26.080> like<00:03:26.230> now

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
for example let's say I'm doing like now

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.960 
for example let's say I'm doing like now
I'm<00:03:26.560> doing<00:03:26.800> 40<00:03:27.550> km/h<00:03:28.319> let's<00:03:29.319> slice<00:03:29.830> that's<00:03:30.280> 20

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
I'm doing 40 km/h let's slice that's 20

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.559 
I'm doing 40 km/h let's slice that's 20
miles<00:03:31.569> per<00:03:31.780> hour<00:03:31.900> plus<00:03:32.800> the<00:03:33.160> fur<00:03:33.520> in<00:03:33.790> 40<00:03:34.330> so

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
miles per hour plus the fur in 40 so

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:36.690 
miles per hour plus the fur in 40 so
that's<00:03:34.750> 24<00:03:35.470> What's<00:03:35.890> Wrong<00:03:35.980> it<00:03:36.220> up<00:03:36.310> i'm<00:03:36.459> doing

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
that's 24 What's Wrong it up i'm doing

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.270 
that's 24 What's Wrong it up i'm doing
about<00:03:36.880> 25<00:03:37.390> miles<00:03:37.660> an<00:03:37.810> hour<00:03:37.930> i'm<00:03:38.680> going<00:03:38.950> to<00:03:39.099> try

about 25 miles an hour i'm going to try

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.490 
about 25 miles an hour i'm going to try

there<00:03:48.459> is<00:03:48.489> some<00:03:49.300> margin<00:03:49.810> of<00:03:49.930> error<00:03:50.110> but<00:03:50.380> it's

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
there is some margin of error but it's

there is some margin of error but it's

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
not really that big I don't want the

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
found i will not filter here it doesn't

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.300 
found i will not filter here it doesn't
really<00:03:54.700> matter<00:03:55.180> for<00:03:55.300> me<00:03:55.480> now<00:03:55.950> this<00:03:56.950> is<00:03:57.100> visor

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
really matter for me now this is visor

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.130 
really matter for me now this is visor
up<00:03:57.549> sorry<00:03:59.040> it<00:04:00.040> should<00:04:00.489> sound<00:04:00.730> weird<00:04:01.030> let's<00:04:01.840> say

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
up sorry it should sound weird let's say

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.890 
up sorry it should sound weird let's say
I'm<00:04:02.470> doing<00:04:02.830> zero<00:04:03.069> like<00:04:03.519> now<00:04:03.700> I<00:04:03.910> divide<00:04:04.330> 0<00:04:04.569> x<00:04:04.840> 2

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
I'm doing zero like now I divide 0 x 2

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.470 
I'm doing zero like now I divide 0 x 2
which<00:04:05.350> is<00:04:05.560> zero<00:04:05.590> and<00:04:05.950> then<00:04:06.130> abs<00:04:06.340> removed<00:04:07.000> digit

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
which is zero and then abs removed digit

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.120 
which is zero and then abs removed digit
and<00:04:07.630> then<00:04:07.810> universe<00:04:08.410> implodes<00:04:08.769> because<00:04:09.069> it

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
and then universe implodes because it

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.839 
and then universe implodes because it
makes<00:04:09.250> no<00:04:09.400> sense<00:04:09.840> so<00:04:10.840> let's<00:04:11.110> say<00:04:11.260> I'm<00:04:11.620> doing<00:04:12.069> 70

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
makes no sense so let's say I'm doing 70

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:16.050 
makes no sense so let's say I'm doing 70
like<00:04:12.970> I<00:04:13.030> was<00:04:13.299> on<00:04:13.450> that<00:04:13.599> moon<00:04:13.959> on<00:04:14.170> that<00:04:14.349> film<00:04:15.060> 70

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
like I was on that moon on that film 70

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.580 
like I was on that moon on that film 70
by<00:04:16.239> half<00:04:16.540> its<00:04:16.810> 35<00:04:17.609> +<00:04:18.609> 7<00:04:19.090> is<00:04:19.239> ok<00:04:20.049> now<00:04:20.229> this<00:04:20.410> is

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
by half its 35 + 7 is ok now this is

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.330 
by half its 35 + 7 is ok now this is
weird<00:04:20.769> so<00:04:21.280> that's<00:04:21.579> good<00:04:21.930> 40s<00:04:22.930> ding<00:04:23.169> 42<00:04:23.919> 43

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
weird so that's good 40s ding 42 43

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.110 
weird so that's good 40s ding 42 43

American V loggers the other way around
is<00:04:37.330> easier<00:04:37.810> you<00:04:37.960> just<00:04:37.990> add<00:04:39.000> fifty<00:04:40.000> percent<00:04:40.330> and

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
is easier you just add fifty percent and

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.890 
is easier you just add fifty percent and
then<00:04:41.260> add<00:04:41.470> a<00:04:41.500> bit<00:04:41.740> more<00:04:41.770> in<00:04:42.190> that<00:04:42.340> bit<00:04:42.610> that

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
then add a bit more in that bit that

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.590 
then add a bit more in that bit that
bits<00:04:43.900> can<00:04:44.200> also<00:04:44.440> be<00:04:44.770> the<00:04:45.039> last<00:04:45.700> the<00:04:46.390> front

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
bits can also be the last the front

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.710 
bits can also be the last the front
digit<00:04:47.220> for<00:04:48.220> example<00:04:48.729> let's<00:04:48.850> say<00:04:49.210> the<00:04:49.539> guy<00:04:49.660> is

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
digit for example let's say the guy is

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.040 
digit for example let's say the guy is
doing<00:04:49.990> 60<00:04:50.500> you<00:04:50.830> add<00:04:51.039> half<00:04:51.550> of<00:04:51.700> 60<00:04:52.120> which<00:04:52.270> is<00:04:52.510> 30

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
doing 60 you add half of 60 which is 30

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.250 
doing 60 you add half of 60 which is 30
so<00:04:53.620> you<00:04:53.680> got<00:04:53.830> 90<00:04:54.280> km/h<00:04:54.760> long<00:04:55.240> and<00:04:55.479> then<00:04:56.110> you

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
so you got 90 km/h long and then you

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.340 
so you got 90 km/h long and then you
have<00:04:56.410> to<00:04:56.560> add<00:04:56.590> a<00:04:56.979> bit<00:04:57.250> and<00:04:58.169> okay<00:04:59.169> I<00:04:59.200> know

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
have to add a bit and okay I know

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.560 
have to add a bit and okay I know
beforehand<00:04:59.800> it's<00:04:59.950> supposed<00:05:00.250> to<00:05:00.310> go<00:05:00.460> 10<00:05:00.700> so

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
beforehand it's supposed to go 10 so

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.010 
beforehand it's supposed to go 10 so
he's<00:05:01.750> going<00:05:01.930> 60<00:05:02.470> you<00:05:02.740> had<00:05:03.010> like<00:05:03.669> six<00:05:04.180> and<00:05:04.570> you

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
he's going 60 you had like six and you

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.320 
he's going 60 you had like six and you
got<00:05:05.200> 96<00:05:05.950> and<00:05:06.190> you<00:05:06.280> still<00:05:06.460> have<00:05:06.610> to<00:05:06.820> add<00:05:06.880> a<00:05:06.910> bit

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
got 96 and you still have to add a bit

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.940 
got 96 and you still have to add a bit
more

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
more

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.470 
more
because<00:05:09.950> you're<00:05:10.100> actually<00:05:10.310> adding<00:05:10.820> sixty

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:11.480 
because you're actually adding sixty

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.270 
because you're actually adding sixty
percent<00:05:11.630> since<00:05:12.440> one<00:05:13.430> mile<00:05:14.240> is<00:05:14.510> 1.6<00:05:15.200> 09<00:05:15.860> 3

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
percent since one mile is 1.6 09 3

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.010 
percent since one mile is 1.6 09 3
kilometers<00:05:16.850> just<00:05:17.300> go<00:05:17.600> I<00:05:17.630> don't<00:05:17.780> want<00:05:17.960> to

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
kilometers just go I don't want to

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.410 
kilometers just go I don't want to
filter<00:05:18.230> I<00:05:18.560> don't<00:05:19.280> want<00:05:19.400> to<00:05:19.460> filter<00:05:19.670> much<00:05:19.970> on<00:05:20.210> to

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:20.420 
filter I don't want to filter much on to

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.630 
filter I don't want to filter much on to
filter<00:05:20.690> behind<00:05:20.990> you<00:05:21.110> guys<00:05:21.260> when<00:05:22.100> everyone

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640 
filter behind you guys when everyone

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:35.540 
filter behind you guys when everyone
knows<00:05:22.670> bikes<00:05:23.030> are<00:05:23.180> passing<00:05:23.480> oh<00:05:23.630> that<00:05:24.230> hurts

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.120 

yes<00:05:36.270> bikes<00:05:36.570> are<00:05:36.750> passing<00:05:37.140> to<00:05:37.410> not<00:05:37.560> squeeze<00:05:37.950> as

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
yes bikes are passing to not squeeze as

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.380 
yes bikes are passing to not squeeze as
you<00:05:38.220> Fox

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.410 

yeah<00:05:43.020> so<00:05:43.260> it's<00:05:43.530> really<00:05:43.860> that<00:05:44.190> simple<00:05:44.240> you<00:05:45.240> have

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:45.420 
yeah so it's really that simple you have

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.180 
yeah so it's really that simple you have
to<00:05:45.570> add<00:05:45.690> sixty<00:05:46.050> percent<00:05:46.170> from

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
to add sixty percent from

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.330 
to add sixty percent from
kilometres<00:05:48.970> from<00:05:49.780> miles<00:05:50.020> to<00:05:50.170> kilometers<00:05:50.340> so

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
kilometres from miles to kilometers so

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.130 
kilometres from miles to kilometers so
let's<00:05:51.670> say<00:05:51.880> 100<00:05:52.450> miles<00:05:52.630> an<00:05:52.810> hour<00:05:52.900> r<00:05:53.340> 160<00:05:54.340> kph

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.140 
let's say 100 miles an hour r 160 kph

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.460 
let's say 100 miles an hour r 160 kph
and<00:05:56.140> that's<00:05:57.100> I<00:05:57.400> 35<00:05:58.270> miles<00:05:58.600> an<00:05:58.750> hour<00:05:58.870> that's<00:05:59.380> a

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
and that's I 35 miles an hour that's a

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.770 
and that's I 35 miles an hour that's a
good<00:05:59.620> number<00:06:00.120> some<00:06:01.120> experience<00:06:01.600> should<00:06:01.720> be

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
good number some experience should be

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.530 
good number some experience should be
something<00:06:02.350> you're<00:06:02.530> on<00:06:02.740> the<00:06:03.070> range<00:06:03.250> of<00:06:03.400> 50<00:06:03.850> kph

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:04.540 
something you're on the range of 50 kph

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.780 
something you're on the range of 50 kph
or<00:06:04.900> something<00:06:05.350> like<00:06:05.410> that<00:06:05.500> but<00:06:05.830> let's<00:06:06.100> see<00:06:06.250> 35

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:06.790 
or something like that but let's see 35

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:14.910 
or something like that but let's see 35
should<00:06:07.090> be<00:06:08.550> plus<00:06:09.550> half<00:06:09.820> half<00:06:10.480> of<00:06:10.660> 45<00:06:11.260> is<00:06:11.670> 15<00:06:13.920> 17

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:14.920 
should be plus half half of 45 is 15 17

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.790 
should be plus half half of 45 is 15 17
and<00:06:15.220> something<00:06:15.760> so<00:06:16.720> let's<00:06:16.930> have<00:06:17.110> 17<00:06:17.500> something

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
and something so let's have 17 something

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.260 
and something so let's have 17 something
for<00:06:17.920> 35<00:06:18.400> that's<00:06:18.700> 40<00:06:19.360> 50<00:06:20.080> something<00:06:20.710> hey<00:06:21.670> 35

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
for 35 that's 40 50 something hey 35

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.570 
for 35 that's 40 50 something hey 35
should<00:06:22.450> be<00:06:22.540> around<00:06:22.690> 60<00:06:23.200> kph<00:06:23.590> not<00:06:24.040> 50s<00:06:24.400> I<00:06:24.460> was

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580 
should be around 60 kph not 50s I was

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:31.380 
should be around 60 kph not 50s I was
expecting<00:06:25.230> 30<00:06:26.460> 30<00:06:27.460> s<00:06:27.670> plus<00:06:28.450> 20<00:06:28.900> plus<00:06:29.140> 15<00:06:30.390> which

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:31.390 
expecting 30 30 s plus 20 plus 15 which

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:35.670 
expecting 30 30 s plus 20 plus 15 which
means<00:06:31.420> it's<00:06:31.960> 45<00:06:32.560> was<00:06:33.010> a<00:06:33.040> bit<00:06:33.490> more<00:06:33.760> 50<00:06:34.690> ish<00:06:34.900> yeah

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 
means it's 45 was a bit more 50 ish yeah

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.970 
means it's 45 was a bit more 50 ish yeah
that's<00:06:36.010> it<00:06:36.160> it<00:06:36.370> works<00:06:36.670> really<00:06:36.880> works<00:06:37.210> oh<00:06:37.980> and

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:44.980 
using the metric system it's so much

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.160 
using the metric system it's so much
simpler<00:06:45.370> and<00:06:45.670> the<00:06:45.790> whole<00:06:45.970> you<00:06:46.690> are<00:06:46.810> basically

the only country in the world which

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.880 
the only country in the world which
still<00:06:48.640> uses<00:06:48.910> it<00:06:49.030> don't<00:06:49.990> go<00:06:50.140> with<00:06:50.320> tradition

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:50.890 
still uses it don't go with tradition

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.910 

we<00:06:55.400> had<00:06:55.580> a<00:06:56.020> 600<00:06:57.020> year<00:06:57.050> old<00:06:57.350> tradition<00:06:57.770> of<00:06:57.890> using

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:57.920 
we had a 600 year old tradition of using

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.860 
we had a 600 year old tradition of using
other<00:06:58.400> measuring<00:06:58.880> units<00:06:59.210> and<00:06:59.390> then<00:06:59.510> we<00:06:59.660> just

00:06:59.860 --> 00:06:59.870 
other measuring units and then we just

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.290 
other measuring units and then we just
switch<00:07:00.230> the<00:07:00.260> two<00:07:00.590> metric<00:07:00.950> because<00:07:01.100> it's<00:07:01.370> that

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:02.300 
switch the two metric because it's that
