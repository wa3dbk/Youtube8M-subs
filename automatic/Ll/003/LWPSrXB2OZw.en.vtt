the thermo scientific night on Excel 2

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.380 
the thermo scientific night on Excel 2
is<00:00:22.410> used<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.190> analyze<00:00:23.520> a<00:00:23.550> couple<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.060> different

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
is used to analyze a couple of different

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.770 
is used to analyze a couple of different
samples<00:00:24.780> of<00:00:24.960> gold<00:00:25.410> jewelry<00:00:26.330> first<00:00:27.330> off<00:00:27.570> what

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:27.780 
samples of gold jewelry first off what

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.020 
samples of gold jewelry first off what
we'll<00:00:27.930> do<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.230> we'll<00:00:28.350> measure<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.890> gold<00:00:29.760> link

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:30.030 
we'll do is we'll measure a gold link

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.389 
we'll do is we'll measure a gold link
bracelet<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.720> it's<00:00:31.500> as<00:00:31.650> simple<00:00:31.680> as<00:00:32.009> taking

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
bracelet and it's as simple as taking

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.639 
bracelet and it's as simple as taking
the<00:00:32.430> analyzer<00:00:32.879> putting<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.840> directly<00:00:33.989> on<00:00:34.469> the

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
the analyzer putting it directly on the

the analyzer putting it directly on the
sample<00:00:35.390> squeezing<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.510> holding<00:00:36.539> a<00:00:36.870> trigger

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
sample squeezing and holding a trigger

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.240 
sample squeezing and holding a trigger
and<00:00:37.670> in<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:39.030> couple<00:00:39.720> of<00:00:39.780> seconds<00:00:40.140> we<00:00:40.860> can<00:00:40.890> see

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
and in a couple of seconds we can see

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.710 
and in a couple of seconds we can see
the<00:00:41.370> results<00:00:41.790> indicating<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.360> it's<00:00:42.570> got

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
the results indicating that it's got

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.200 
the results indicating that it's got
about<00:00:42.960> 58<00:00:43.530> percent<00:00:43.560> gold<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.760> that

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
about 58 percent gold and that

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.170 
about 58 percent gold and that
translates<00:00:45.750> into<00:00:45.960> 14<00:00:46.590> carat<00:00:47.040> we<00:00:47.489> can<00:00:47.640> also<00:00:47.790> see

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
translates into 14 carat we can also see

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.170 
translates into 14 carat we can also see
the<00:00:48.450> roughly<00:00:49.050> 6<00:00:49.350> percent<00:00:49.440> silver<00:00:50.070> as<00:00:50.730> well<00:00:51.030> as

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
the roughly 6 percent silver as well as

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.600 
the roughly 6 percent silver as well as
the<00:00:51.390> zinc<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.840> about<00:00:52.079> 28<00:00:53.010> percent<00:00:53.190> copper

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
the zinc and about 28 percent copper

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.299 
the zinc and about 28 percent copper
present<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.329> sample<00:00:54.510> now<00:00:55.350> let's<00:00:56.100> take<00:00:56.280> a

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
present in the sample now let's take a

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.100 
present in the sample now let's take a
look<00:00:56.460> at<00:00:56.579> this<00:00:56.730> wedding<00:00:56.940> band<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.510> see<00:00:57.930> how

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
look at this wedding band and see how

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.010 
look at this wedding band and see how
the<00:00:58.170> results<00:00:58.500> differ<00:00:59.450> so<00:01:00.450> it's<00:01:00.630> as<00:01:00.719> easy<00:01:00.840> as

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
the results differ so it's as easy as

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.540 
the results differ so it's as easy as
placing<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.649> instruments<00:01:02.100> back<00:01:02.219> on<00:01:02.460> the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
placing the instruments back on the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.880 
placing the instruments back on the
sample<00:01:06.110> placing<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.170> instrument<00:01:07.560> back<00:01:07.680> on

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
sample placing the instrument back on

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.889 
sample placing the instrument back on
the<00:01:07.979> sample<00:01:08.450> squeezing<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.569> holding<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
the sample squeezing and holding the

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.899 
the sample squeezing and holding the
trigger

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.120 

and<00:01:13.060> in<00:01:13.630> a<00:01:13.720> few<00:01:13.930> seconds<00:01:14.320> we<00:01:14.530> can<00:01:14.560> see<00:01:14.920> pretty

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
and in a few seconds we can see pretty

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.050 
and in a few seconds we can see pretty
clearly<00:01:15.250> that<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.990> is<00:01:17.049> also<00:01:17.680> a<00:01:17.890> 14<00:01:18.729> karat

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
clearly that this is also a 14 karat

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.800 
clearly that this is also a 14 karat
gold<00:01:19.299> with<00:01:19.509> 50<00:01:19.960> with<00:01:20.170> it's<00:01:20.770> got<00:01:20.950> 58%<00:01:21.610> gold<00:01:22.119> it's

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
gold with 50 with it's got 58% gold it's

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.870 
gold with 50 with it's got 58% gold it's
got<00:01:23.049> a<00:01:23.080> little<00:01:23.380> bit<00:01:23.590> less<00:01:23.860> silver<00:01:24.220> now<00:01:24.670> what's

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
got a little bit less silver now what's

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.670 
got a little bit less silver now what's
interesting<00:01:25.240> and<00:01:25.600> different<00:01:26.080> between<00:01:26.380> this

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
interesting and different between this

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.679 
interesting and different between this
sample<00:01:27.190> and<00:01:27.399> the<00:01:27.820> bracelet<00:01:28.240> that<00:01:28.270> we<00:01:28.479> just

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
sample and the bracelet that we just

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.930 
sample and the bracelet that we just
measured<00:01:28.930> is<00:01:29.229> that<00:01:29.799> this<00:01:29.979> sample<00:01:30.250> has<00:01:30.610> both

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
measured is that this sample has both

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.660 
measured is that this sample has both
white<00:01:31.330> and<00:01:31.509> yellow<00:01:32.049> gold<00:01:32.380> this<00:01:32.710> ring<00:01:32.979> and<00:01:33.190> so

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
white and yellow gold this ring and so

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.160 
white and yellow gold this ring and so
we<00:01:33.820> can<00:01:34.000> see<00:01:34.180> not<00:01:34.360> only<00:01:34.630> that<00:01:34.780> we<00:01:34.869> have<00:01:35.049> the

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
we can see not only that we have the

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.649 
we can see not only that we have the
copper<00:01:35.560> present<00:01:36.310> in<00:01:36.369> the<00:01:36.430> sample<00:01:36.640> but<00:01:37.390> we<00:01:37.509> also

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
copper present in the sample but we also

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.660 
copper present in the sample but we also
picked<00:01:38.020> up<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.350> nickel<00:01:38.710> which<00:01:39.220> is<00:01:39.250> indicative

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
picked up the nickel which is indicative

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.539 
picked up the nickel which is indicative
of<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.690> element<00:01:41.320> that's<00:01:41.409> added<00:01:41.890> to<00:01:42.369> make
