of them because my nails are quite short

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.369 
of them because my nails are quite short
so<00:00:55.760> I'm<00:00:55.850> just<00:00:56.089> measuring<00:00:56.390> out<00:00:56.780> to<00:00:56.989> see<00:00:57.170> which

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
so I'm just measuring out to see which

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.439 
so I'm just measuring out to see which
size<00:00:57.799> actually<00:00:58.250> fits<00:00:58.699> my<00:00:58.909> nail<00:00:59.089> best<00:01:01.449> you're

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
size actually fits my nail best you're

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.329 
size actually fits my nail best you're
just<00:01:02.689> going<00:01:02.960> to<00:01:03.199> peel<00:01:03.710> it<00:01:03.739> off<00:01:04.040> the<00:01:04.070> backing

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
just going to peel it off the backing

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:11.100 
just going to peel it off the backing
sheet<00:01:04.760> and<00:01:05.330> place<00:01:06.260> it<00:01:06.530> onto<00:01:06.740> your<00:01:07.220> fingernail

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.800 

so<00:01:12.110> these<00:01:12.260> are<00:01:12.470> actually<00:01:12.920> great<00:01:13.250> for<00:01:13.810> natural

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
so these are actually great for natural

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.870 
so these are actually great for natural
nails<00:01:15.020> and<00:01:15.440> last<00:01:15.860> year<00:01:16.130> I<00:01:16.160> was<00:01:16.430> told<00:01:16.640> they

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
nails and last year I was told they

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.420 
nails and last year I was told they
aren't<00:01:17.090> very<00:01:17.240> good<00:01:17.330> for<00:01:17.740> acrylics<00:01:18.740> but<00:01:18.890> this

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
aren't very good for acrylics but this

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.490 
aren't very good for acrylics but this
year<00:01:19.670> they<00:01:19.820> told<00:01:20.060> me<00:01:20.270> that<00:01:20.420> they<00:01:20.570> were<00:01:20.630> fine<00:01:20.990> so

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
year they told me that they were fine so

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.040 
year they told me that they were fine so
let's<00:01:22.130> see<00:01:22.340> how<00:01:22.520> they<00:01:22.670> goes<00:01:22.910> so<00:01:23.780> I've<00:01:23.870> just

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
let's see how they goes so I've just

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.690 
let's see how they goes so I've just
pasted<00:01:24.350> it<00:01:24.530> onto<00:01:24.710> my<00:01:24.860> nail<00:01:25.040> and<00:01:25.310> I'm<00:01:25.400> just

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
pasted it onto my nail and I'm just

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.730 
pasted it onto my nail and I'm just
heating<00:01:26.060> up<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.720> foil<00:01:27.020> or<00:01:27.200> now<00:01:27.320> I've<00:01:27.470> seen

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
heating up the foil or now I've seen

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.730 
heating up the foil or now I've seen
this<00:01:27.950> done<00:01:28.250> without<00:01:28.460> heat<00:01:29.180> but<00:01:29.990> apparently

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
this done without heat but apparently

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.130 
this done without heat but apparently
they<00:01:30.980> work<00:01:31.220> best<00:01:31.580> if<00:01:31.909> you<00:01:32.150> heat<00:01:32.450> up<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.900> foil

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
they work best if you heat up the foil

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.410 
they work best if you heat up the foil
just<00:01:33.440> a<00:01:33.650> little<00:01:33.920> bit<00:01:36.670> I'm<00:01:37.670> just<00:01:37.909> going<00:01:38.150> to<00:01:38.180> take

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
just a little bit I'm just going to take

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.750 
just a little bit I'm just going to take
my<00:01:38.600> nail<00:01:38.780> scissors<00:01:39.260> now<00:01:39.470> and<00:01:39.770> cut<00:01:40.250> off<00:01:40.460> the

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
my nail scissors now and cut off the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.850 
my nail scissors now and cut off the
excess<00:01:41.180> if<00:01:41.840> you've<00:01:42.140> got<00:01:42.380> longer<00:01:42.590> nails

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
excess if you've got longer nails

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.640 
excess if you've got longer nails
obviously<00:01:43.670> you<00:01:43.850> can<00:01:44.030> skip<00:01:44.330> this<00:01:44.570> part<00:01:44.630> but<00:01:45.500> if

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
obviously you can skip this part but if

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.440 
obviously you can skip this part but if
you've<00:01:45.770> got<00:01:45.800> shorter<00:01:46.370> nails<00:01:46.520> like<00:01:46.820> me<00:01:47.120> you<00:01:47.240> can

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
you've got shorter nails like me you can

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.080 
you've got shorter nails like me you can
keep<00:01:47.750> that<00:01:47.960> extra<00:01:48.409> bit<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:48.830> then<00:01:49.220> reuse<00:01:49.550> it

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
keep that extra bit and then reuse it

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.430 
keep that extra bit and then reuse it
and<00:01:50.600> you'll<00:01:51.140> get<00:01:51.320> an<00:01:51.560> extra<00:01:52.690> hair<00:01:53.690> out<00:01:54.050> of<00:01:54.260> this

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
and you'll get an extra hair out of this

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.950 
and you'll get an extra hair out of this
set<00:01:54.830> so<00:01:55.670> I'm<00:01:55.729> just<00:01:55.940> smoothing<00:01:56.240> it<00:01:56.540> out<00:01:56.690> now

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
set so I'm just smoothing it out now

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.110 
set so I'm just smoothing it out now

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.340 
and fold it under make sure it's nice
and<00:02:19.640> smooth<00:02:19.970> you<00:02:20.240> can<00:02:20.300> heat<00:02:20.660> it<00:02:20.690> up<00:02:20.870> at<00:02:21.110> this

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
and smooth you can heat it up at this

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.440 
and smooth you can heat it up at this
stage<00:02:21.650> if<00:02:21.950> you<00:02:22.100> like

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
stage if you like

off<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:26.870> edges<00:02:27.230> and<00:02:27.500> follow<00:02:27.830> it<00:02:28.010> downwards

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
off the edges and follow it downwards

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.280 
off the edges and follow it downwards
you<00:02:28.670> don't<00:02:28.850> want<00:02:29.000> to<00:02:29.060> push<00:02:29.270> it<00:02:29.450> up<00:02:29.630> because<00:02:29.990> you

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
you don't want to push it up because you

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.160 
you don't want to push it up because you
might<00:02:30.470> actually<00:02:30.860> lift<00:02:31.100> up<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.400> foil<00:02:31.670> so

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
might actually lift up the foil so

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.190 
might actually lift up the foil so
that's<00:02:33.170> my<00:02:33.380> nail<00:02:33.980> done<00:02:34.450> I'll<00:02:35.450> show<00:02:35.750> you<00:02:35.810> again

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
what I did with that leftover piece from

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.680 
what I did with that leftover piece from
my<00:02:39.440> other<00:02:39.620> hand<00:02:39.980> so<00:02:40.670> you<00:02:40.730> can<00:02:41.180> see<00:02:41.390> it<00:02:41.510> doesn't

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
my other hand so you can see it doesn't

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.510 
my other hand so you can see it doesn't
have<00:02:41.930> a<00:02:41.960> round<00:02:42.320> edge<00:02:42.620> so<00:02:42.980> I<00:02:43.010> just<00:02:43.250> took<00:02:43.460> my

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
have a round edge so I just took my

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.370 
have a round edge so I just took my
scissors<00:02:44.090> which<00:02:44.270> you<00:02:44.420> can't<00:02:44.660> see<00:02:44.780> me<00:02:44.990> doing<00:02:45.170> at

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
scissors which you can't see me doing at

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.260 
scissors which you can't see me doing at
the<00:02:45.500> moment<00:02:45.650> but<00:02:46.040> I<00:02:46.070> just<00:02:46.370> rounded<00:02:46.910> off<00:02:47.060> the

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
the moment but I just rounded off the

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.210 
the moment but I just rounded off the
edges<00:02:47.630> there<00:02:47.840> so<00:02:48.110> I<00:02:48.140> could<00:02:48.440> push<00:02:48.650> it<00:02:48.680> up<00:02:49.010> next

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
edges there so I could push it up next

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.890 
edges there so I could push it up next
to<00:02:49.370> my<00:02:49.490> cuticle<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.030> it<00:02:50.210> would<00:02:50.330> be<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.660> right

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
to my cuticle and it would be the right

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.490 
to my cuticle and it would be the right
shape

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.170

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
then I'm just going to apply it straight

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.039
