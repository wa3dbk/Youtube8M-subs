00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
for a few miles so they're kind of

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.490 
for a few miles so they're kind of
broken<00:00:31.949> in<00:00:32.070> but<00:00:32.669> not<00:00:32.820> fully<00:00:33.149> broken<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:33.750> but

broken in but not fully broken in but
they<00:00:34.649> work<00:00:34.829> just<00:00:35.130> amazingly<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:36.090> we'll<00:00:36.210> go<00:00:36.300> to

they work just amazingly so we'll go to

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.720 
they work just amazingly so we'll go to
spin<00:00:36.719> here<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.020> see<00:00:37.170> how<00:00:37.230> long<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.649> goes

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
spin here and see how long it goes

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.790 
spin here and see how long it goes
starting<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:38.879> around<00:00:39.230> 50<00:00:40.230> seconds<00:00:40.680> by<00:00:40.770> the

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
starting this around 50 seconds by the

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.860 
starting this around 50 seconds by the
time<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.100> spin<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:42.120> we'll<00:00:42.270> see<00:00:42.300> how<00:00:42.540> long<00:00:42.690> it

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
time I spin it so we'll see how long it

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:51.630 
time I spin it so we'll see how long it
spins<00:00:43.140> for

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.729

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
but you never know how long they've been

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:03.930 
but you never know how long they've been
sitting<00:01:02.920> on<00:01:03.010> the<00:01:03.070> shelf<00:01:03.309> and<00:01:03.460> everything<00:01:03.760> so

anything that's fine but I'm just gonna
stop<00:01:21.100> talking<00:01:21.130> and<00:01:21.610> let<00:01:21.700> it<00:01:21.820> spin<00:01:22.030> till<00:01:22.240> it

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
stop talking and let it spin till it

00:01:22.330 --> 00:02:51.440 
stop talking and let it spin till it
stops<00:01:22.600> and<00:01:22.810> we'll<00:01:22.900> see<00:01:23.020> how<00:01:23.110> long<00:01:23.229> it<00:01:23.409> goes<00:01:23.560> for

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.449 

all<00:02:51.990> right<00:02:52.140> so<00:02:52.380> it<00:02:52.470> looks<00:02:52.650> like<00:02:52.830> a<00:02:52.860> little<00:02:53.310> bit

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
all right so it looks like a little bit

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.220 
all right so it looks like a little bit
over<00:02:53.670> two<00:02:53.849> minutes<00:02:54.060> not<00:02:54.660> bad

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
over two minutes not bad

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.750 
over two minutes not bad
I've<00:02:55.530> seen<00:02:55.770> some<00:02:55.980> videos<00:02:56.069> where<00:02:56.400> people<00:02:56.430> get

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
I've seen some videos where people get

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.580 
I've seen some videos where people get
you<00:02:56.910> know<00:02:56.940> three<00:02:57.630> four<00:02:57.660> minutes<00:02:58.260> I'm<00:02:58.380> some

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
you know three four minutes I'm some

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.920 
you know three four minutes I'm some
bearings<00:02:58.950> but<00:02:59.730> two<00:03:00.060> minutes<00:03:00.360> spin<00:03:00.630> very

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
bearings but two minutes spin very

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.260 
bearings but two minutes spin very
smoothly<00:03:01.319> you<00:03:01.470> heard<00:03:01.650> no<00:03:01.800> noise<00:03:02.120> they<00:03:03.120> work

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
smoothly you heard no noise they work

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.180 
smoothly you heard no noise they work
really<00:03:03.480> nice<00:03:03.750> I<00:03:04.020> mean<00:03:04.140> you<00:03:04.590> can<00:03:04.709> get<00:03:04.860> cheaper

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
really nice I mean you can get cheaper

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.570 
really nice I mean you can get cheaper
bearings<00:03:05.550> but<00:03:06.239> I<00:03:06.270> had<00:03:06.450> some<00:03:06.599> a<00:03:06.720> bike<00:03:06.900> sevens

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
bearings but I had some a bike sevens

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.740 
bearings but I had some a bike sevens
don't<00:03:08.580> know<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.790> exact<00:03:09.060> brand<00:03:09.270> but<00:03:09.569> I<00:03:09.600> had

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
don't know the exact brand but I had

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.000 
don't know the exact brand but I had
some<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:09.989> back<00:03:10.170> sevens<00:03:10.590> in<00:03:10.709> there<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:10.950> they

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
some a back sevens in there and they

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.170 
some a back sevens in there and they
spun<00:03:11.220> for<00:03:11.459> like<00:03:11.580> 20<00:03:12.000> 30<00:03:12.180> seconds<00:03:12.840> so<00:03:14.180> bearing

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
spun for like 20 30 seconds so bearing

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.160 
spun for like 20 30 seconds so bearing
definitely<00:03:15.540> makes<00:03:15.660> a<00:03:15.750> difference<00:03:15.780> you're

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
definitely makes a difference you're

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.720 
definitely makes a difference you're
gonna<00:03:16.260> get<00:03:16.440> farther<00:03:16.680> ride<00:03:17.010> with<00:03:17.280> each<00:03:17.400> push

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
gonna get farther ride with each push

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.509 
gonna get farther ride with each push
and<00:03:18.440> you<00:03:19.440> know<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.590> little<00:03:19.680> bit<00:03:19.860> faster<00:03:20.280> speed

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
and you know a little bit faster speed

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.520 
and you know a little bit faster speed
if<00:03:20.730> you're<00:03:20.849> going<00:03:21.030> downhill<00:03:21.209> or<00:03:21.480> even<00:03:21.870> faster

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
if you're going downhill or even faster

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.320 
if you're going downhill or even faster
just<00:03:22.709> pushing<00:03:23.099> and<00:03:23.250> longer<00:03:23.730> you<00:03:24.239> know

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
just pushing and longer you know

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.820 
just pushing and longer you know
maintain<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.930> speed<00:03:25.170> longer<00:03:25.530> with<00:03:25.680> nice

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
maintain the speed longer with nice

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.300 
maintain the speed longer with nice
bearings<00:03:26.280> so<00:03:26.519> definitely<00:03:27.420> recommend<00:03:27.840> the

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
bearings so definitely recommend the

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.699
