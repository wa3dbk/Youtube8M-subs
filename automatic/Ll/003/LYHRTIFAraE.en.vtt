let's<00:00:29.010> go<00:00:29.130> with<00:00:29.279> what<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.820> so<00:00:30.449> this<00:00:30.660> is

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
let's go with what it is so this is

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.780 
let's go with what it is so this is
pretty<00:00:30.960> much<00:00:31.080> you<00:00:31.949> get<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.160> free<00:00:32.250> minecraft

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
pretty much you get a free minecraft

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.470 
pretty much you get a free minecraft
server<00:00:33.000> these<00:00:33.450> specs<00:00:33.780> are<00:00:34.940> it's<00:00:35.940> running<00:00:36.360> on

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
server these specs are it's running on

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.619 
server these specs are it's running on
1.6<00:00:37.200> by<00:00:37.500> one<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.610> has<00:00:38.760> half<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.329> gig<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.600> ram

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
1.6 by one and it has half a gig of ram

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.020 
1.6 by one and it has half a gig of ram
with<00:00:40.200> 24<00:00:40.649> players<00:00:40.920> slots<00:00:41.219> so<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.640> should<00:00:41.879> not

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
with 24 players slots so it should not

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.150 
with 24 players slots so it should not
like<00:00:42.360> I'll<00:00:42.989> recommend<00:00:43.350> just<00:00:43.710> playing<00:00:43.980> with

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
like I'll recommend just playing with

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.180 
like I'll recommend just playing with
the<00:00:44.460> two<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.570> 10<00:00:46.020> friends<00:00:46.350> because<00:00:46.829> more<00:00:47.039> than

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
the two to 10 friends because more than

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.310 
the two to 10 friends because more than
that<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.520> think<00:00:47.550> it'll<00:00:48.090> like<00:00:48.239> 512<00:00:48.960> megabytes

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
that it I think it'll like 512 megabytes

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.139 
that it I think it'll like 512 megabytes
of<00:00:49.410> RAM<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.770> actually<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.399> much<00:00:50.820> for<00:00:51.059> a

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
of RAM is actually that much for a

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.139 
of RAM is actually that much for a
server<00:00:51.649> the<00:00:52.649> next<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.699> catch<00:00:53.879> though

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
server the next this is the catch though

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.000 
server the next this is the catch though
the<00:00:54.690> server<00:00:54.930> gets<00:00:55.079> destroyed<00:00:55.379> after<00:00:55.559> six

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
the server gets destroyed after six

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.459 
the server gets destroyed after six
hours<00:00:56.160> or<00:00:56.550> one<00:00:56.730> hour<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:57.030> inactivity<00:00:57.260> but<00:00:58.260> you

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
hours or one hour of inactivity but you

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.200 
hours or one hour of inactivity but you
can<00:00:58.590> extend<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.010> time<00:00:59.190> for<00:00:59.489> just<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.760> few<00:00:59.910> cents

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
can extend the time for just a few cents

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.729 
can extend the time for just a few cents
if<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.449> purchase<00:01:00.780> extra<00:01:01.050> time<00:01:01.289> your<00:01:01.559> server

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
if you purchase extra time your server

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.240 
if you purchase extra time your server
will<00:01:01.800> not<00:01:02.010> be<00:01:02.160> deleted<00:01:02.340> for<00:01:02.609> an<00:01:02.699> activity<00:01:02.940> so

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
will not be deleted for an activity so

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.469 
will not be deleted for an activity so
let's<00:01:05.250> just<00:01:05.430> get<00:01:05.519> into<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:05.909> if<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.240> click<00:01:06.420> this
