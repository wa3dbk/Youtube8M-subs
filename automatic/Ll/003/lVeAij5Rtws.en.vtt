00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.200
 ntn24 establishes direct contact in 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.539
 Bogota Colombia with Jorge Enrique 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.099
 robledo he is a senator of the opposition 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.860
 for the democratic pole party 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:23.200
 alternative senator robledo welcome to 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.460
 ntn24 to the informative for our 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.519
 teleaudience in the American continent 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.769
 Good evening, come back nights and many 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:32.080
 thanks for your very kind communication 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:33.940
 thank you very much as in your opinion 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.210
 configures then the political struggle of 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.410
 colombia if the president saints 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.070
 will effectively be launched already 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.900
 re-election 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.800
 Well, I would say it's bad news 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.850
 even a terrible news because 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.760
 finally the president saints has 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.620
 announced today as well including I think 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.780
 violating the rules because he has had 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.710
 to wait until November but today 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.720
 launches even when you try to hide it and it 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.000
 launches is to reelect your project or 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.290
 what he has been doing and without a doubt what 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.300
 what he has been doing has been 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.310
 tremendously negative for the country in 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.800
 its features in its fundamental features 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.039
 so I say it's negative because 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.170
 we are at risk of reelecting those 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:17.180
 policies and re-elect the president 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.039
 saints let's say that in danger of 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.350
 re-elect these things that come 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:24.590
 working pretty badly 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.460
 then the news is definitely 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.380
 a violence a negative news 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.810
 I hope yes of course in the process 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.210
 let's create a different option 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.430
 that ends up defeating this project 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.200
 reeleccionista that nothing good would leave him 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.700
 to the country senator oakwood good night 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.130
 Andrea Bernal greets you 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.780
 consequences will have on these new 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.070
 elections the division between the forces 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.360
 policies that lead 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.520
 in his time to saints to the presidency 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.580
 this is a matter that is fine 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.590
 interesting and that threatens in matter 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.170
 important the success of that project 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.910
 reelectionist first let's say this in 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.220
 the surveys all say that the 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.990
 Colombians do not want the re - election of 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.090
 president hugo less high not the 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.399
 they want and that's one thing that's fine 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.410
 known but it is also evident that 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.930
 forces that chose Juan Manuel 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.390
 saints today are divided into a part 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.790
 fundamental of those who took the 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.890
 let's say they decided the election in 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.320
 general we can call it the uribismo not 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.000
 is already accompanying that project later 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.740
 here opens a very possibility 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.390
 interesting what is it that we 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.950
 we aspire to represent in the pole 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.630
 democratic with a project of 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.700
 convergence and that is that our candidate 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.770
 the clear doctor lopez with a kind 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.780
 of the third-party phenomenon 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.450
 appearing in the middle as one might 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.970
 say and finish let's say earning the 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.720
 state address and of course 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.239
 defeating the reelectionist aspiration 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.080
 of the president saints and their squire 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.520
 the doctor german vargas lleras 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.740
 senator now that is talking about this 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.450
 then of those political forces you 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.680
 he is an emblematic man of the left 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.020
 and we must also say that the left 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.730
 has received very strong blows in 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.610
 Colombia for allegations of corruption and 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.990
 deep divisions with a left 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.150
 weakened and divided with the right 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.300
 also divided with the former president 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.160
 Uribe in a corner and with the president 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.870
 saints in half who is the 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.810
 opportunity to be the next president 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.570
 from colombia then I would say that the 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.250
 opportunity, let's say in terms 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.070
 theoreticians any of the three parties 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.320
 I could win but I hope that this 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.880
 end up working out for the benefit of the 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.410
 candidacy of the author clara lópez 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.450
 among other things for one thing that there 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.520
 to say with all clarity and about 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.400
 which there is confusion in the country that is 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.560
 very struggle is the controversy between juan 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.959
 Manuel Santos and Álvaro Uribe and their 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.520
 respective friends can not be confused 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.680
 with that being a contradiction 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.620
 really background they are pretty 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.240
 more similar similar ones that 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.070
 different have we say a 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.020
 important contradiction no doubt in the 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.580
 theme of the peace process but in all 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.330
 the other matters of national life 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.360
 they represent basically the same thing 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.550
 Juan Manuel Santos was minister of 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.470
 álvaro uribe not in part not in vain 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.270
 álvaro uribe was finally the one who 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.410
 he chose otherwise saints never 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.820
 had come to the address of 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.470
 been then we then 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.720
 we hope that Colombians 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.490
 understand this and understand that Colombia 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.890
 you need a deep turn of your 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.019
 economic and social policy and of all 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.540
 your orientations because the truth is 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.250
 that Colombia is increasingly a country 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.930
 failed in what it has to do 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.300
 particularly with the needs 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.650
 citizens the economy of the country is very 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:31.000
 badly and poverty is falling is going to 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.670
 grow each time in proportions more 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.190
 big the industry is a disaster the 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.810
 levels of unbalanced external debt 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.700
 of the balance of the current account are 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.620
 very serious and if there is no change here 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.140
 deep and that change we only propose it 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.880
 we colombia will end up in the 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.460
 next government in very serious problems 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.140
 economic and social jorge enrique 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.850
 oakdo opposition party senator 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.990
 alternative democratic pole we 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.910
 accompanied here tonight in the 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.580
 information for all Latin America '
