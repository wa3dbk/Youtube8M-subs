00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
here I'm going to be flipping this

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.900 
here I'm going to be flipping this
switch<00:00:55.230> which<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.800> my<00:00:55.949> flaps<00:00:56.309> it's<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.640> three

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
switch which is my flaps it's a three

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.849 
switch which is my flaps it's a three
position<00:00:57.090> switch<00:00:57.800> one<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.160> two<00:00:59.520> okay<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.859> you

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
position switch one and two okay and you

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.500 
position switch one and two okay and you
will<00:01:01.980> see<00:01:02.449> that<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.510> have<00:01:03.600> flaps<00:01:04.760> okay<00:01:05.760> even

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
will see that I have flaps okay even

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.190 
will see that I have flaps okay even
though<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.600> have<00:01:06.810> flaps<00:01:07.280> I<00:01:08.280> still<00:01:09.030> have<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.689> long

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
though I have flaps I still have a long

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.350 
though I have flaps I still have a long
control<00:01:10.650> list<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.400> I'm<00:01:11.520> able<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.790> have<00:01:12.000> flaps

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
control list so I'm able to have flaps

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.560 
control list so I'm able to have flaps
and<00:01:12.780> ailerons<00:01:13.320> control<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.760> for<00:01:14.970> takeoffs

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
and ailerons control so for takeoffs

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.600 
and ailerons control so for takeoffs
I've<00:01:16.200> also<00:01:16.409> slowed<00:01:16.830> down<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.130> speed<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.490> we're

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
I've also slowed down the speed so we're

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.410 
I've also slowed down the speed so we're
going<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.759> talk<00:01:17.850> about<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.330> little

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
going to talk about that in a little

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.530 
going to talk about that in a little
while<00:01:18.570> for<00:01:18.840> takeoffs<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.470> use<00:01:19.830> one<00:01:20.540> for

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
while for takeoffs I use one for

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.620 
while for takeoffs I use one for
landings<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.439> use<00:01:22.650> two<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.159> if<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.520> notice<00:01:23.939> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
landings I use two and if you notice the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.370 
landings I use two and if you notice the
elevator<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:26.180> also<00:01:27.180> moving<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.900> conjunction

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
elevator is also moving in conjunction

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.760 
elevator is also moving in conjunction
with<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.430> flaps<00:01:29.729> it's<00:01:30.060> ever<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:30.390> slight<00:01:30.869> but

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
with the flaps it's ever so slight but

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.249 
with the flaps it's ever so slight but
it<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.009> moving<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.579> we'll<00:01:32.850> explain<00:01:33.210> why<00:01:33.450> here

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
it is moving and we'll explain why here

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.170 
it is moving and we'll explain why here
in<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.439> little<00:01:34.619> bit<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.100> remember<00:01:35.490> one<00:01:35.909> side

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
in a little bit so remember one side

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.960 
in a little bit so remember one side
goes<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.710> aileron<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.490> other<00:01:38.610> side<00:01:38.850> is

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
goes to aileron and the other side is

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.819 
goes to aileron and the other side is
going<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.119> go<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.360> ox<00:01:40.259> for<00:01:40.799> K<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.400> now<00:01:42.829> to

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
going to go to ox for K so now to

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.700

unplug<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.570> plane<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:55.079> make<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.350> safe<00:01:55.590> while<00:01:56.310> I

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
unplug the plane to make it safe while I

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.950 
unplug the plane to make it safe while I
do<00:01:56.490> some<00:01:56.729> explanations<00:01:57.329> for<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.600> guys<00:01:57.780> so

okay so first thing you're going to need

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.340 
okay so first thing you're going to need
a<00:02:10.200> digital<00:02:11.160> controller<00:02:11.760> that<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.600> capable<00:02:13.080> of

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
a digital controller that is capable of

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.670 
a digital controller that is capable of
doing<00:02:13.670> mixing<00:02:14.670> okay<00:02:14.970> if<00:02:15.420> you<00:02:16.020> have<00:02:16.200> this<00:02:16.410> style

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
doing mixing okay if you have this style

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.380 
doing mixing okay if you have this style
controller<00:02:17.190> of<00:02:17.430> one<00:02:17.580> of<00:02:17.700> those<00:02:17.819> ready-to-fly

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
controller of one of those ready-to-fly

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.590 
controller of one of those ready-to-fly
controllers<00:02:19.170> that<00:02:19.350> has<00:02:19.560> four<00:02:19.830> channels

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
controllers that has four channels

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
controllers that has four channels
something<00:02:21.600> like<00:02:21.720> that<00:02:21.870> this<00:02:22.050> is<00:02:22.230> not<00:02:22.260> going<00:02:22.560> to

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
something like that this is not going to

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.650 
something like that this is not going to
work<00:02:22.860> this<00:02:23.370> can<00:02:23.610> do<00:02:23.700> your<00:02:23.850> four<00:02:24.090> channel<00:02:24.420> stuff

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
work this can do your four channel stuff

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.449 
work this can do your four channel stuff
if<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:24.930> wasn't<00:02:25.200> using<00:02:25.440> flat<00:02:25.860> prongs<00:02:26.100> I<00:02:26.310> could

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
if I wasn't using flat prongs I could

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:27.770 
if I wasn't using flat prongs I could
probably<00:02:26.640> fly<00:02:26.850> this<00:02:26.910> plane<00:02:27.239> with<00:02:27.390> this<00:02:27.510> and

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
probably fly this plane with this and

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.910 
probably fly this plane with this and
you<00:02:27.930> know<00:02:27.959> actually<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.319> would<00:02:28.530> because<00:02:28.800> this

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
you know actually I would because this

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.059 
you know actually I would because this
is<00:02:29.190> can<00:02:29.819> bind<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.120> it<00:02:30.300> it's<00:02:31.020> its<00:02:31.380> spectrum<00:02:31.830> but

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
is can bind to it it's its spectrum but

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.080 
is can bind to it it's its spectrum but
doesn't<00:02:35.069> fly<00:02:35.190> good<00:02:35.400> with<00:02:35.550> these<00:02:35.640> controllers

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
doesn't fly good with these controllers

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.620 
doesn't fly good with these controllers
and<00:02:36.540> this<00:02:37.350> is<00:02:37.530> not<00:02:37.680> programmable<00:02:38.280> for<00:02:38.730> rates

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
and this is not programmable for rates

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.750 
and this is not programmable for rates
or<00:02:40.110> throw<00:02:40.739> or<00:02:40.950> anything<00:02:41.130> like<00:02:41.370> that<00:02:41.400> so<00:02:41.730> you

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
or throw or anything like that so you

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.759 
or throw or anything like that so you
need<00:02:42.150> you<00:02:42.870> know<00:02:42.959> something<00:02:43.320> like<00:02:43.440> this<00:02:43.560> this

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
need you know something like this this

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.100 
need you know something like this this
is<00:02:43.830> entry<00:02:44.220> level<00:02:44.250> dx6i<00:02:45.000> does<00:02:45.450> ten<00:02:45.660> birds<00:02:45.900> it's

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
is entry level dx6i does ten birds it's

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.670

once<00:04:02.730> you<00:04:02.820> have<00:04:02.970> that<00:04:03.090> set<00:04:03.150> up<00:04:03.680> the<00:04:04.680> only<00:04:04.950> thing

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
once you have that set up the only thing

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.569 
once you have that set up the only thing
you<00:04:05.220> need<00:04:05.370> to<00:04:05.640> do<00:04:05.940> now<00:04:06.180> is<00:04:06.739> go<00:04:07.739> to<00:04:07.769> your<00:04:08.280> main

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
you need to do now is go to your main

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.129 
you need to do now is go to your main
screen<00:04:08.900> so<00:04:09.900> I'm<00:04:09.989> going<00:04:10.170> to<00:04:10.230> go<00:04:10.290> to<00:04:10.350> main<00:04:10.650> ok

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
screen so I'm going to go to main ok

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:15.620 
screen so I'm going to go to main ok
then<00:04:13.139> we're<00:04:13.230> going<00:04:13.350> to<00:04:13.380> enter<00:04:13.859> our<00:04:14.310> menu<00:04:14.970> we're

then we're going to enter our menu we're

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.509 
then we're going to enter our menu we're
going<00:04:15.750> to<00:04:15.840> go<00:04:15.900> to<00:04:15.959> servo<00:04:16.290> setup

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
going to go to servo setup

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.930 
going to go to servo setup
we're<00:04:17.579> going<00:04:17.699> to<00:04:17.759> go<00:04:17.849> down<00:04:18.060> to<00:04:19.190> reverse<00:04:20.190> I'm

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
we're going to go down to reverse I'm

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.200 
we're going to go down to reverse I'm
going<00:04:21.150> to<00:04:21.209> go<00:04:21.449> to<00:04:22.129> right<00:04:23.129> aileron<00:04:23.490> and<00:04:23.819> I'm

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
going to go to right aileron and I'm

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.879 
going to go to right aileron and I'm
going<00:04:24.360> to<00:04:24.419> reverse<00:04:24.720> that<00:04:24.780> one<00:04:25.169> okay<00:04:25.500> you<00:04:25.740> see

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
going to reverse that one okay you see

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:30.830 
going to reverse that one okay you see
that<00:04:25.919> then<00:04:28.819> left<00:04:29.819> aileron<00:04:30.030> because<00:04:30.629> this

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
that then left aileron because this

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.649 
that then left aileron because this
already<00:04:31.050> figured<00:04:31.530> out<00:04:31.680> that<00:04:32.300> ox1<00:04:33.300> is<00:04:33.449> going<00:04:33.599> to

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:33.659 
already figured out that ox1 is going to

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:35.360 
already figured out that ox1 is going to
be<00:04:33.720> my<00:04:33.840> left<00:04:34.020> aileron<00:04:34.229> because<00:04:34.710> how<00:04:34.860> I<00:04:34.889> set<00:04:35.280> it

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
be my left aileron because how I set it

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.520 
be my left aileron because how I set it
up<00:04:35.460> in<00:04:35.669> the<00:04:35.909> previous<00:04:36.300> setup<00:04:36.509> menu<00:04:36.900> for

up in the previous setup menu for

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.159 
up in the previous setup menu for
flapper<00:04:38.400> ons<00:04:38.669> I'm<00:04:39.150> going<00:04:39.360> to<00:04:39.419> set<00:04:39.599> this<00:04:39.750> up<00:04:40.020> as

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
flapper ons I'm going to set this up as

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.710 
flapper ons I'm going to set this up as
reverse<00:04:40.830> and<00:04:41.069> for<00:04:41.220> some<00:04:41.400> reason<00:04:41.789> that<00:04:42.449> seems

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
reverse and for some reason that seems

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.540 
reverse and for some reason that seems
to<00:04:42.870> work<00:04:42.900> for<00:04:43.319> this<00:04:43.470> particular<00:04:43.680> plane<00:04:44.220> you

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
to work for this particular plane you

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.119 
to work for this particular plane you
may<00:04:44.580> not<00:04:44.909> you<00:04:45.330> may<00:04:45.360> need<00:04:45.659> to<00:04:45.810> reverse<00:04:46.169> one<00:04:47.009> or

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:47.129 
may not you may need to reverse one or

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:48.710 
may not you may need to reverse one or
the<00:04:47.220> other<00:04:47.370> channel<00:04:47.759> or<00:04:47.879> maybe<00:04:48.030> both<00:04:48.240> channels

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
the other channel or maybe both channels

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.420 
the other channel or maybe both channels
I'm<00:04:48.900> not<00:04:49.110> too<00:04:49.289> sure<00:04:49.530> but<00:04:49.889> something<00:04:50.250> you're

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
I'm not too sure but something you're

going to need to play around with a

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.640 
going to need to play around with a
little<00:04:51.630> bit<00:04:51.750> and<00:04:51.870> then<00:04:51.990> you<00:04:52.110> can<00:04:52.259> get<00:04:52.409> it<00:04:52.500> done

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
little bit and then you can get it done

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:59.170 
little bit and then you can get it done
okay<00:04:55.550> this<00:04:56.550> will<00:04:56.759> actually<00:04:57.000> get<00:04:57.449> it<00:04:57.599> working

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
okay this will actually get it working

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.790 
okay this will actually get it working
but<00:05:00.180> what<00:05:00.780> you<00:05:00.900> want<00:05:01.080> to<00:05:01.169> do<00:05:01.289> is<00:05:01.409> you<00:05:01.500> want<00:05:01.680> to

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
adjust the speed now okay so I go down

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.210 
adjust the speed now okay so I go down
to<00:05:04.740> flaps<00:05:05.449> okay<00:05:06.449> let's<00:05:07.229> see<00:05:07.440> on<00:05:07.650> normal<00:05:08.039> I<00:05:08.099> have

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.800 
take off I have 30 percent flap and five
percent<00:05:13.620> elevation<00:05:14.130> for<00:05:14.969> landing<00:05:15.330> I<00:05:15.389> have<00:05:15.509> 50

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810

percent<00:05:16.169> flaps<00:05:16.409> 10<00:05:16.710> percent<00:05:17.069> elevator<00:05:17.629> what

00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:18.629 
percent flaps 10 percent elevator what

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:20.540 
percent flaps 10 percent elevator what
having<00:05:19.169> the<00:05:19.259> elevator<00:05:19.650> does<00:05:19.919> for<00:05:20.190> you<00:05:20.310> is<00:05:20.490> it

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
having the elevator does for you is it

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.909 
having the elevator does for you is it
stops<00:05:21.300> the<00:05:21.509> nose<00:05:21.659> from<00:05:21.870> pitching<00:05:22.319> up<00:05:22.469> when<00:05:22.830> you

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
stops the nose from pitching up when you

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.070 
stops the nose from pitching up when you
give<00:05:23.099> it<00:05:23.219> flaps<00:05:23.520> okay<00:05:24.240> so<00:05:24.569> you<00:05:24.659> need<00:05:24.780> to<00:05:24.900> give<00:05:25.050> a

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
give it flaps okay so you need to give a

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.059 
give it flaps okay so you need to give a
little<00:05:25.259> bit<00:05:25.469> of<00:05:25.590> negative<00:05:25.740> elevator<00:05:26.340> to<00:05:28.069> bring

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:29.069 
little bit of negative elevator to bring

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:31.370 
little bit of negative elevator to bring
the<00:05:29.250> nose<00:05:29.430> back<00:05:29.819> down<00:05:30.120> basically<00:05:30.659> you<00:05:31.229> don't

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
the nose back down basically you don't

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.930 
the nose back down basically you don't
want<00:05:31.500> the<00:05:31.590> nose<00:05:31.740> to<00:05:31.889> pitch<00:05:32.069> up<00:05:32.280> violently<00:05:32.639> okay

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
want the nose to pitch up violently okay

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.240 
want the nose to pitch up violently okay
I'll<00:05:33.360> have<00:05:33.479> the<00:05:33.630> speed<00:05:33.960> set<00:05:34.259> to<00:05:34.409> three<00:05:34.740> seconds

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
I'll have the speed set to three seconds

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.719 
I'll have the speed set to three seconds
okay<00:05:35.669> you<00:05:36.659> can<00:05:36.810> adjust<00:05:37.169> the<00:05:37.319> speed<00:05:37.590> in<00:05:37.770> here<00:05:38.039> so

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
okay you can adjust the speed in here so

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:40.070 
okay you can adjust the speed in here so
that<00:05:38.759> it<00:05:38.909> goes<00:05:39.150> a<00:05:39.180> little<00:05:39.330> slower<00:05:39.719> you<00:05:39.900> don't

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
that it goes a little slower you don't

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.570 
that it goes a little slower you don't
want<00:05:40.229> it<00:05:40.319> to<00:05:40.380> go<00:05:40.500> super<00:05:40.949> fast<00:05:40.979> cos<00:05:41.340> and<00:05:41.490> it's

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
want it to go super fast cos and it's

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.620 
want it to go super fast cos and it's
going<00:05:41.669> to<00:05:41.729> pitch<00:05:41.940> up<00:05:42.120> unless<00:05:42.300> you're<00:05:42.539> doing
