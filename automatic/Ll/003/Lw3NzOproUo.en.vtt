here<00:01:10.609> I'm<00:01:10.700> using<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:11.090> mechanical<00:01:12.049> keyboard

00:01:12.669 --> 00:01:12.679 
here I'm using the mechanical keyboard

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:15.069 
here I'm using the mechanical keyboard
red<00:01:12.860> switches<00:01:13.130> the<00:01:14.030> MX<00:01:14.270> red<00:01:14.420> switches<00:01:14.689> and

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:15.079 
red switches the MX red switches and

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:16.569 
red switches the MX red switches and
that<00:01:15.649> doesn't<00:01:15.890> really<00:01:16.039> have<00:01:16.189> a<00:01:16.219> tactile

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579 
that doesn't really have a tactile

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:18.999 
that doesn't really have a tactile
feedback<00:01:16.880> more<00:01:17.329> of<00:01:17.420> a<00:01:17.479> smooth<00:01:17.750> travel<00:01:18.170> so<00:01:18.950> you

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
feedback more of a smooth travel so you

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.100 
feedback more of a smooth travel so you
don't<00:01:19.340> get<00:01:19.460> that<00:01:19.579> really<00:01:19.789> clicky<00:01:20.149> sound<00:01:20.179> on<00:01:20.780> a

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
don't get that really clicky sound on a

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.480 
don't get that really clicky sound on a
blue<00:01:21.679> or<00:01:21.710> brown

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
blue or brown

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.550 
blue or brown
when<00:01:22.729> you<00:01:22.880> click<00:01:23.289> but<00:01:24.289> if<00:01:24.350> you<00:01:24.439> actually

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
when you click but if you actually

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.440 
when you click but if you actually
bottom<00:01:25.009> out<00:01:25.130> the<00:01:25.280> keys<00:01:25.520> and<00:01:25.789> it<00:01:25.880> does<00:01:26.060> kind<00:01:26.270> of

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
bottom out the keys and it does kind of

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.529 
bottom out the keys and it does kind of
give<00:01:27.380> like<00:01:27.619> a<00:01:27.649> weird<00:01:27.920> like<00:01:28.209> clicking<00:01:29.209> sound

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
give like a weird like clicking sound

give like a weird like clicking sound
which<00:01:29.899> I<00:01:29.990> guess<00:01:30.200> is<00:01:30.350> all<00:01:30.500> right<00:01:31.060> and<00:01:33.130> moving

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
which I guess is all right and moving

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.089

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:16.609 
and two ports for USB but how cube had

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:18.490 
and two ports for USB but how cube had
have<00:02:16.730> done<00:02:16.760> it<00:02:16.970> is<00:02:17.060> they've<00:02:17.510> just<00:02:17.720> put<00:02:18.470> a

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
have done it is they've just put a

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.520 
have done it is they've just put a
rubber<00:02:18.739> rubberized<00:02:19.400> a<00:02:19.930> bit<00:02:20.930> of<00:02:20.989> plastic<00:02:21.170> on<00:02:21.500> it

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
rubber rubberized a bit of plastic on it

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.379 
rubber rubberized a bit of plastic on it
and<00:02:21.769> it<00:02:22.250> it<00:02:22.730> doesn't<00:02:22.880> really<00:02:23.120> suit<00:02:23.329> the

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:23.389 
and it it doesn't really suit the

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:25.059 
and it it doesn't really suit the
keyboard<00:02:23.750> that<00:02:23.810> well<00:02:24.019> but<00:02:24.200> you<00:02:24.680> don't<00:02:24.709> really

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
keyboard that well but you don't really

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.830 
keyboard that well but you don't really
see<00:02:25.310> it<00:02:25.370> that<00:02:25.519> much<00:02:25.549> so<00:02:25.940> it's<00:02:26.209> not<00:02:26.329> too<00:02:26.600> much<00:02:26.720> of

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
see it that much so it's not too much of

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.300 
see it that much so it's not too much of
a<00:02:26.870> complaint<00:02:27.139> but<00:02:27.319> that<00:02:27.859> is<00:02:27.980> something<00:02:28.250> that

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
a complaint but that is something that

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.770 
a complaint but that is something that
could<00:02:28.519> be<00:02:28.670> improved<00:02:28.850> in<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.090> future<00:02:30.609> so<00:02:31.780> now

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
could be improved in the future so now

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.830 
could be improved in the future so now
looking<00:02:32.989> at<00:02:33.139> any<00:02:33.290> key<00:02:33.470> switches<00:02:33.739> itself<00:02:34.840> using

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
looking at any key switches itself using

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.920 
looking at any key switches itself using
this<00:02:35.989> key<00:02:36.410> cameras<00:02:36.980> really<00:02:37.190> easy<00:02:37.630> it<00:02:38.630> doesn't

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
this key cameras really easy it doesn't

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.150 
this key cameras really easy it doesn't
take<00:02:39.079> anything<00:02:39.319> at<00:02:39.530> all<00:02:39.650> it's<00:02:39.980> going<00:02:40.069> to

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
take anything at all it's going to

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.800 
take anything at all it's going to
remove

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.300 

now<00:02:44.810> you<00:02:44.870> can<00:02:45.080> see<00:02:46.180> with<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.330> red<00:02:47.480> switches<00:02:48.310> it

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
now you can see with the red switches it

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.670 
now you can see with the red switches it
really<00:02:49.670> Z's<00:02:49.880> press<00:02:50.210> it's<00:02:50.540> like<00:02:50.720> compared<00:02:51.530> to<00:02:51.620> a

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
really Z's press it's like compared to a

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.800 
really Z's press it's like compared to a
member<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:52.130> keyboard<00:02:52.490> is<00:02:52.700> so<00:02:53.300> much<00:02:53.450> easier<00:02:53.780> to

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
member and keyboard is so much easier to

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.720 
member and keyboard is so much easier to
press<00:02:54.110> because<00:02:54.380> you<00:02:54.920> didn't<00:02:55.100> get<00:02:55.220> that<00:02:55.340> really

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
press because you didn't get that really

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.130 
press because you didn't get that really
squishy<00:02:56.120> feeling<00:02:56.600> when<00:02:56.720> you<00:02:56.810> press<00:02:57.020> the

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
squishy feeling when you press the

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.550 
squishy feeling when you press the
normal<00:02:57.440> red<00:02:57.560> normal<00:02:58.490> main<00:02:58.670> membrane<00:02:59.150> keyboard

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
normal red normal main membrane keyboard

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.800 
normal red normal main membrane keyboard
but<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.650> MX<00:03:00.980> red<00:03:01.220> is<00:03:01.370> actually<00:03:01.630> really<00:03:02.630> good

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
but the MX red is actually really good

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.540 
but the MX red is actually really good
this<00:03:02.960> feels<00:03:03.500> nice<00:03:03.830> when<00:03:03.860> you<00:03:04.070> press<00:03:04.250> it<00:03:04.400> down

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
this feels nice when you press it down

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.110 
this feels nice when you press it down
and<00:03:06.130> there<00:03:07.130> isn't<00:03:07.340> it<00:03:07.460> there<00:03:07.610> isn't<00:03:07.700> a<00:03:07.820> tactile

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
the extra key caps are given the orange

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.190 
the extra key caps are given the orange
ones<00:03:21.620> I<00:03:22.270> really<00:03:23.270> found<00:03:23.450> a<00:03:23.600> purpose<00:03:23.930> for<00:03:24.110> it

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
ones I really found a purpose for it

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.310 
ones I really found a purpose for it
because<00:03:24.530> I<00:03:24.890> like<00:03:25.580> the<00:03:25.610> design<00:03:26.270> of<00:03:26.570> how<00:03:26.840> it<00:03:26.960> goes

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.770 

but<00:03:30.320> I<00:03:30.380> suppose<00:03:31.070> you<00:03:31.490> could<00:03:32.030> use<00:03:32.060> it<00:03:32.330> for<00:03:32.420> this

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
but I suppose you could use it for this

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.290 
but I suppose you could use it for this
I<00:03:33.020> mean<00:03:33.830> I'm<00:03:34.070> sure<00:03:34.130> I<00:03:34.340> look<00:03:34.610> good<00:03:34.760> around<00:03:35.030> but

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
I mean I'm sure I look good around but

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.700 
I mean I'm sure I look good around but
you<00:03:35.390> just<00:03:35.510> start<00:03:35.780> it<00:03:35.870> around<00:03:36.020> any<00:03:36.170> and

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:36.710 
you just start it around any and

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.230 
you just start it around any and
keyboard<00:03:37.130> you<00:03:37.220> get<00:03:37.370> four<00:03:37.820> of<00:03:37.850> these<00:03:38.000> so

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
keyboard you get four of these so

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.900 
keyboard you get four of these so
there's<00:03:38.420> three<00:03:38.690> more<00:03:39.550> but<00:03:40.550> yeah<00:03:40.670> it<00:03:40.760> looks

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
there's three more but yeah it looks

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.630 
there's three more but yeah it looks
good<00:03:41.180> and<00:03:41.440> it<00:03:42.440> feels<00:03:42.740> pretty<00:03:43.160> much<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.460> same

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
good and it feels pretty much the same

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.430 
good and it feels pretty much the same
so<00:03:43.910> they<00:03:44.600> can<00:03:44.780> paint<00:03:44.990> so<00:03:45.140> that

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.110 

and<00:03:49.440> just<00:03:49.980> talk<00:03:50.190> about<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.430> build<00:03:50.610> quality<00:03:50.730> as

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
and just talk about the build quality as

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.620 
and just talk about the build quality as
well<00:03:51.330> the<00:03:51.660> keyboard<00:03:52.080> it<00:03:53.120> flexes<00:03:54.120> a<00:03:54.150> little<00:03:54.480> bit

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
well the keyboard it flexes a little bit

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.930 
well the keyboard it flexes a little bit
but<00:03:55.200> for<00:03:55.380> around<00:03:55.500> fifty<00:03:55.890> five<00:03:56.040> pounds<00:03:56.280> that

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
but for around fifty five pounds that

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.640 
but for around fifty five pounds that
you<00:03:56.970> very<00:03:57.330> solidly<00:03:57.750> built<00:03:58.020> compared<00:03:58.500> to<00:03:58.620> a

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
you very solidly built compared to a

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.920 
you very solidly built compared to a
membrane<00:03:58.950> keyboard<00:03:59.220> which<00:04:00.150> like<00:04:00.450> flexes<00:04:00.870> a

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
membrane keyboard which like flexes a

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.180 
membrane keyboard which like flexes a
lot<00:04:01.140> mean<00:04:01.319> you<00:04:01.380> could<00:04:01.530> snap<00:04:01.770> it<00:04:01.890> quite<00:04:02.040> easily

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
lot mean you could snap it quite easily

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.729 
lot mean you could snap it quite easily
whereas<00:04:02.640> this<00:04:02.849> you<00:04:03.780> know<00:04:03.900> it<00:04:04.170> would<00:04:04.349> take<00:04:04.530> one

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
whereas this you know it would take one

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.309 
whereas this you know it would take one
for<00:04:05.099> specially<00:04:05.610> get<00:04:06.330> a<00:04:06.390> reasonable<00:04:06.930> bent<00:04:07.140> in

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
for specially get a reasonable bent in

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:14.900 
for specially get a reasonable bent in
it<00:04:07.519> so<00:04:08.519> yep<00:04:12.170> now<00:04:13.170> full<00:04:13.410> of<00:04:13.440> price<00:04:13.860> let<00:04:14.610> it<00:04:14.730> say
