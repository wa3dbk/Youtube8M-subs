like<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.019> static<00:00:31.349> much<00:00:31.560> static<00:00:31.800> route<00:00:32.070> is

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
like the static much static route is

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.240 
like the static much static route is
going<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.399> stick<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:32.820> anyway<00:00:33.180> uh<00:00:34.250> and

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
going to stick to that anyway uh and

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.840 
going to stick to that anyway uh and
then<00:00:35.520> moving<00:00:36.300> over<00:00:36.719> here<00:00:36.750> i'll<00:00:38.030> be<00:00:40.850> putting

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850

then moving over here i'll be putting
some<00:00:42.180> dirt<00:00:42.570> here<00:00:43.079> on<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:44.430> path<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:47.360> for<00:00:48.360> as

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
some dirt here on this path and for as

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.180 
some dirt here on this path and for as
little<00:00:49.110> path<00:00:49.410> going<00:00:49.770> up<00:00:50.149> into<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.180> park<00:00:51.680> so<00:00:52.680> and

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
little path going up into a park so and

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.369 
little path going up into a park so and
that's<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.660> trailhead<00:00:54.660> shop<00:00:54.930> i<00:00:55.170> may<00:00:55.320> be

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
that's the trailhead shop i may be

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.900 
that's the trailhead shop i may be
moving<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.800> out<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.129> way<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.280> don't<00:00:56.520> mess

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
moving that out of the way so don't mess

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.340 
moving that out of the way so don't mess
it<00:00:56.940> up<00:00:57.149> but<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.600> just<00:00:57.660> kind<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.079> give<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.260> an

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
it up but that just kind of give you an

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.130 
it up but that just kind of give you an
idea<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:59.300> lay<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.480> land<00:01:00.750> here<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:03.140> space

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
idea of lay of the land here and space

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.230 
idea of lay of the land here and space
is<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> little<00:01:04.619> tight<00:01:04.799> here<00:01:04.830> but<00:01:05.309> it'll<00:01:06.030> work

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
is a little tight here but it'll work

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.179 
is a little tight here but it'll work
and<00:01:06.479> then<00:01:07.340> after<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.400> if<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.860> doesn't<00:01:10.860> get<00:01:10.979> too

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
and then after that if I doesn't get too

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.149 
and then after that if I doesn't get too
late<00:01:11.490> I'll<00:01:11.880> probably<00:01:12.150> start<00:01:13.010> working<00:01:14.010> on

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
late I'll probably start working on

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.030 
late I'll probably start working on
making<00:01:14.580> some<00:01:15.060> more<00:01:15.299> trees<00:01:16.140> making<00:01:16.500> some<00:01:16.799> trees

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
making some more trees making some trees

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.429

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
wire trees and actually trying to refine

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.670 
wire trees and actually trying to refine
my<00:01:25.710> technique<00:01:25.740> some<00:01:27.170> had<00:01:28.170> some<00:01:28.350> time<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.560> think

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
my technique some had some time to think

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.030 
my technique some had some time to think
about<00:01:28.890> what<00:01:29.070> I'd<00:01:29.340> done<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:30.619> in<00:01:31.619> some<00:01:31.770> ways<00:01:31.890> I

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
about what I'd done and in some ways I

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.800 
about what I'd done and in some ways I
like<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.340> in<00:01:32.430> other<00:01:32.549> ways<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.939> can<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.299> see<00:01:33.600> some

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
like it in other ways I can I see some

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.980 
like it in other ways I can I see some
room<00:01:34.079> for<00:01:34.229> improvement<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:35.540> anyway<00:01:36.540> that's

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
room for improvement so anyway that's

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.780 
room for improvement so anyway that's
what's<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.650> agenda<00:01:37.680> tonight<00:01:39.380> alrighty

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
what's on the agenda tonight alrighty

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.539 
what's on the agenda tonight alrighty
stupid<00:01:41.790> hoarding<00:01:42.180> here<00:01:43.130> it's<00:01:44.130> not<00:01:44.280> going<00:01:44.460> to

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
stupid hoarding here it's not going to

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:54.590 
stupid hoarding here it's not going to
take<00:01:44.729> too<00:01:45.240> long<00:01:45.450> do

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.770
