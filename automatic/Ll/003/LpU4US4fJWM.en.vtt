00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
22 80s taken out of the dell these fins

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.749 
22 80s taken out of the dell these fins
here<00:01:52.469> at<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.799> back<00:01:52.979> there<00:01:53.310> i<00:01:53.340> think<00:01:53.490> they're

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
here at the back there i think they're

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.330 
here at the back there i think they're
used<00:01:54.000> for<00:01:54.149> stabilization<00:01:54.630> when<00:01:55.340> dell

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
used for stabilization when dell

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.850 
used for stabilization when dell
computers<00:01:56.909> are<00:01:57.090> shipped<00:01:57.439> because<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.590> locks

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
computers are shipped because it locks

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.770 
computers are shipped because it locks
the<00:01:58.979> cards<00:01:59.460> rigid<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.060> they<00:02:00.149> don't<00:02:00.299> move

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
the cards rigid and they don't move

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.109 
the cards rigid and they don't move
during<00:02:01.320> delivery<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:02.040> that's<00:02:02.850> what<00:02:03.000> these

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
during delivery so that's what these

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:11.060 
during delivery so that's what these
fins<00:02:03.420> are<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.930> can<00:02:04.799> see<00:02:04.979> their<00:02:05.159> 22<00:02:05.579> 80s<00:02:09.590> go<00:02:10.590> cards

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
fins are I can see their 22 80s go cards

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.789 
fins are I can see their 22 80s go cards
and<00:02:11.430> still<00:02:11.700> put<00:02:11.970> your<00:02:12.150> cards<00:02:12.480> but<00:02:13.350> hopefully

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.800 
okay guys now I have my two carton cross
my<00:03:25.739> bridge<00:03:25.950> in<00:03:26.220> I've<00:03:26.430> had<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:27.000> align<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:27.660> two

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
my bridge in I've had to align the two

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.830 
my bridge in I've had to align the two
cards<00:03:28.200> together<00:03:28.580> as<00:03:30.410> d<00:03:31.410> see<00:03:31.950> this<00:03:32.570> pci<00:03:33.570> express

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
cards together as d see this pci express

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.199 
cards together as d see this pci express
here<00:03:34.430> no<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.880> SLI<00:03:36.360> bridge<00:03:36.660> was<00:03:37.320> longer<00:03:38.209> so

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
here no the SLI bridge was longer so

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.449 
here no the SLI bridge was longer so
that's<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:40.250> one<00:03:41.250> of<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:42.500> g1<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.620> 280s<00:03:44.100> was<00:03:44.310> in

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
that's the one of the g1 the 280s was in

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.140 
that's the one of the g1 the 280s was in
here<00:03:45.500> so<00:03:46.500> I've<00:03:46.680> had<00:03:46.860> to<00:03:47.070> move<00:03:47.280> this<00:03:47.489> same<00:03:47.760> card

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
here so I've had to move this same card

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.040 
here so I've had to move this same card
down<00:03:48.480> as<00:03:48.989> you<00:03:49.140> see<00:03:50.030> so<00:03:51.030> some<00:03:51.300> carrots<00:03:51.660> be<00:03:51.780> move

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
down as you see so some carrots be move

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.930 
down as you see so some carrots be move
down<00:03:52.260> these<00:03:52.920> are<00:03:53.160> two<00:03:53.280> together<00:03:53.430> they're

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
down these are two together they're

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.759 
down these are two together they're
quite<00:03:54.330> flush<00:03:54.720> so<00:03:55.320> I'm<00:03:55.560> just<00:03:55.769> a<00:03:55.830> bit<00:03:55.980> concerned

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
quite flush so I'm just a bit concerned

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.430 
quite flush so I'm just a bit concerned
very<00:03:58.769> tight<00:03:59.130> indeed<00:03:59.340> this<00:04:00.209> cable<00:04:00.900> for<00:04:01.410> the

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
very tight indeed this cable for the

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.810 
very tight indeed this cable for the
sound<00:04:01.709> card<00:04:02.010> is<00:04:02.430> literally<00:04:03.590> barely<00:04:04.820> barely

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
sound card is literally barely barely

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.710 
sound card is literally barely barely
get<00:04:06.330> going<00:04:06.600> into<00:04:06.810> Center<00:04:07.850> so<00:04:08.850> it's<00:04:09.180> very

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
get going into Center so it's very

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.479 
get going into Center so it's very
compact<00:04:10.850> it<00:04:11.850> must<00:04:12.090> be<00:04:12.239> almost<00:04:12.510> made<00:04:12.780> I'm<00:04:12.930> a<00:04:13.140> bit

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
compact it must be almost made I'm a bit

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.320 
compact it must be almost made I'm a bit
hmm<00:04:14.489> hesitant<00:04:15.440> but<00:04:16.440> hopefully<00:04:16.980> this<00:04:17.970> card

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
hmm hesitant but hopefully this card

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.150 
hmm hesitant but hopefully this card
first<00:04:18.780> card<00:04:19.080> will<00:04:19.500> take<00:04:19.680> all<00:04:19.799> the<00:04:19.950> pressure

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
first card will take all the pressure

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.600 
first card will take all the pressure
and<00:04:20.640> second<00:04:21.209> card<00:04:21.419> will

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
and second card will

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.899 
and second card will
act<00:04:23.000> as<00:04:23.240> a<00:04:23.560> maybe<00:04:24.560> not<00:04:24.830> as<00:04:25.039> house<00:04:25.370> movie<00:04:25.729> I

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:25.909 
act as a maybe not as house movie I

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:29.230 
act as a maybe not as house movie I
don't<00:04:26.780> know<00:04:26.930> I<00:04:27.490> just<00:04:28.490> have<00:04:28.759> to<00:04:28.789> see<00:04:29.030> how<00:04:29.210> things

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
don't know I just have to see how things

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.879 
don't know I just have to see how things
go<00:04:29.840> but<00:04:30.229> I<00:04:30.259> say<00:04:30.560> it<00:04:30.830> looks<00:04:31.099> very<00:04:31.219> tight<00:04:32.889> anyway

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
go but I say it looks very tight anyway

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:37.529 
go but I say it looks very tight anyway
so<00:04:34.580> this<00:04:34.849> is<00:04:34.909> the<00:04:35.120> case<00:04:35.349> it's<00:04:36.349> been<00:04:36.469> upgraded<00:04:37.069> I

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
so this is the case it's been upgraded I

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:40.480 
so this is the case it's been upgraded I
will<00:04:38.539> now<00:04:38.719> connect<00:04:39.560> it<00:04:39.680> up<00:04:39.740> and<00:04:39.949> see<00:04:40.099> if<00:04:40.219> I<00:04:40.310> can

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
will now connect it up and see if I can

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.179 
will now connect it up and see if I can
get<00:04:40.580> the<00:04:40.759> drivers<00:04:41.210> going<00:04:41.650> this<00:04:42.650> keep<00:04:43.039> my
