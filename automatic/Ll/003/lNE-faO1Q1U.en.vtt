00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:22.140
 Hello, long suffering today jjaja 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:32.180
 This is n mold and mold. 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:36.100
 I do not know what you can do with LeGo. 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.100
 I'll make jelly in English. 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.900
 Ah 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:49.410
 It's gelatin. 7 grams of powdered gelatin. 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:53.090
 I put in a gelatinous hen. 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.090
 Call it cold water. 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:01:00.020

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.020

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.840
 I will 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:10.500
 I need gelatin and put it in cold water. 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.500
 Just put a little water 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:26.979
 I'll mix it up and call you. 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:32.310
 I feel like a retailer and I will be at 2 o'clock next time. 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:35.590
 I have to decide what to do with the color. 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:40.740
 I'll make it blue. 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.740
 The yogeo 100 to spend more pre-commitment 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.319
 Ah 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:57.260
 It's a bit tighter than I thought. 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.260
 I have a few blue pigments. 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.730
 Uh, I think it's going to be a color. 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:12.960
 Element of the moon 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.960
 Let me warm up for a minute in the microwave. 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.030
 Huh 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:28.940
 I'm so sick of microwave 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.940
 Blue Blue Hawaiian That Cake. 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:35.720
 I have already called 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:41.560
 We only have gelatin . 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.560
 It looks like this in gel form . 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:49.080
 Write to the input of a pack 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.480

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.480
 Can you please mark well to commit Wall 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:08.790
 I'm worried about it . It's not a bubble . 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:11.519
 I'll pour a little bit out of it to get rid of the bubbles . 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.480
 Because when making a joint 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:19.670
 When air bubbles enter, 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.670
 It's not pretty. 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.360
 You can arrange it around. 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:35.900
 I've put all the gelatin in it. 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:40.080
 Hope for a new drink + gelatin 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:42.890
 Pour the gelatin into the mold. 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.890
 It's very simple. 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:51.390
 The fighting red mold is a good match for the blue premium. 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:04:01.480
 As it is in the refrigerator, paste it for 3 hours. 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.480
 Les 9 jelly is finished 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.050
 I'm a jelly. 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.150
 I'm stiffening it. I'll take it out.

 It's cleaner than I thought . 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.710
 I think the two guys are running out and I can not do it slowly. 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.710
 Ah 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.789

 Pick 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:06.280
 Almost like a pudding. 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.070
 lee 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.440
 Let's do it this way. 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:24.310
 Eoyeo if one can stand 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:28.750
 Be awake 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:31.810
 I know when a drunken person goes to use 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.800
 Well , this is our guy. 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.800

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.210
 Uh oh. 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.370
 Book your feet and you will start 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:59.910
 Then I'll take a taste of n. 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:07.510
 Oh cruel but your hair again 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.510
 I left my head. 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.160
 I 'll write it down. 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.380
 U 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:32.440

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:45.180
 I'll try to create one of the various flavors of jelly Lego 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.070
