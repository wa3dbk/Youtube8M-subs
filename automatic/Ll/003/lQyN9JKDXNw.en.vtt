00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.309
 step over to the video friends after all I be 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.320
 slightly odd in game format 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.310
 the point is that I have it here 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.680
 in front of me well here 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.050
 from you here as if here before 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.970
 I am worth a computer pit asked 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.010
 they sent me absolutely random 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.859
 interesting questions unknown to me 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.660
 I will read and give you on them 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.079
 some kind of completely random 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.360
 i don't know unexpected answer maybe 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.129
 he will be with Azov already on everything 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.989
 funny maybe he will be strange i 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.350
 absolutely do not know what happens well 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:47.390
 let's try it now i will say 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:51.410
 so as not to start sending ok 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:56.430
 what will happen if you eat 3 tablespoons of salt 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:58.680
 god for brand ok if you eat three 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.730
 spoons of salt I will probably turn you 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:08.119
 pickles when you go with him 2015 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:13.920
 year in may why not celebrate 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:15.659
 40th anniversary this is the way of discharge and 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.909
 know philosophical questions not at all 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.240
 believe in no superstition and black cats 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.700
 40th anniversary and 13th floor and all of it all to me 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.810
 it seems to be complete bullshit and so much 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.670
 as far as you can imagine 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.310
 so the 40th anniversary 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.180
 why it is impossible to celebrate the 40th anniversary because 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.180
 what are you probably 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:39.680
 perhaps it's called a ritualchik 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:42.950
 why do snowmen always do round 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:47.150
 because they ate a lot of olivier salad 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:50.820
 boxes 1 why you can not give a clock 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:53.190
 why can't I give a watch like that 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.720
 I knew that I could not give a watch damn I 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.080
 hit the clock so many times 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.450
 think of my first gift if no 2 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.140
 Olya gift and it was shorter than the first 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.690
 clock 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.740
 second gift clean him so many times 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.899
 gave and watch it can not be done why 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.959
 why you can not give a clock - write in 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:17.330
 I didn't know the comments why 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:20.880
 take pictures of sleeping people and this is clearly 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.830
 sleeping people because sometime long 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.570
 long ago when they just invented the camera 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.040
 Yes, I will tell the right story right now 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.530
 but you really when just invented 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.810
 fotik then people photographed 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.770
 have photographed several times in my life 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.380
 family portrait 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.880
 and then photographed when they 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.070
 to lock in general and they made a photo 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.630
 there with eyes closed and therefore went 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.780
 what if a man eyes closed you 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.489
 he can't be taken a funny type sigh and 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.860
 sleeping people, therefore, too, well, like he 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.140
 dead and all that shorter remember 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.980
 invent 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:56.100
 why came up love damn about this question 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.230
 from the series why did they invent food 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.930
 came up with 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.420
 why did they come up with a river for example 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.640
 love on mine is such a thing just 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.549
 I don't know how about us 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.739
 accompanying pineapple drenches your discounts 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.690
 to heels and then you walk so drenched 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.090
 think damn but 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.010
 the type was cool it was still taken from 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.860
 joy I can not say that to me 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:24.930
 It was like a lot and all that cold and 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.740
 why came up with it seems to come up with me 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.930
 in order that well here people called everything 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:35.330
 in a row this beautiful word of them can 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.830
 be so understand us pets 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:41.340
 Yes 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:44.370
 understand but not all cats seem to me 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.260
 more stupid than dogs to be honest 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.180
 lash cat lovers and please don't 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.730
 pounce on something i love cats too 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.010
 I also have a cat but just by 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.380
 perception of the world although damn it can be 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.660
 dogs are more stupid they are joy 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.170
 and hell knows it seems to me that not us 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:06.260
 somehow understand but you know at the level 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:10.820
 give me something to eat 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:16.290
 my pillow at night did not take away the pillow 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:17.609
 yes why when with the execution of the task 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.340
 problems arise 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:23.669
 the boss always stands above the soul and 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:26.100
 hurries tin this is the situation damn 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.930
 I had a billion times at work 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.910
 and for some reason I did not ask myself this 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.860
 The question is not just in such moments when 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.720
 you know me, this is coming to me 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.690

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.840
 something sent to the printer such 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.800
 I am pleased to meet my way 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.040
 the market boss is right where I have 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.080
 proclaiming not 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.360
 I attach to this printer and printer 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.120
 so slowly she writes me an inscription 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.120

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.280

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.720
 I open a new pack of paper although we 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.910
 it was impossible to do it yourself only 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.390
 needed some dude i thought she 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:17.750
 herself in sso in this paper so that he is 5 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:20.160
 Dear user writes immediately. 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:23.220

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.940
 I think Christ's me cartridge to him 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.130
 end up pushing 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.080
 button he does not write pay on the workbench 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.810
 administrator because the printer is not at home 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:34.110
 the shorter it was already there it was 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:36.360
 tin and then just recently stood 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.640
 not just one boss but in general 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.530
 and the director of the firm's skull and everyone wanted my 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.050
 the report that I worked for 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:45.240
 few days but they got out of it 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.550
 fucking printer what happened next 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.360
 so silent on why the harmful 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:54.680
 products are always tastier than healthy and 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:57.090
 just a mystery of nature guys and me 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.830
 I am worried about this question myself 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.950
 it seems somehow connected 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:05.700
 know with yin and yang 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:08.130
 I think it has something to do with fat 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:12.360
 assholes and and skinny assholes and it seems to me somehow 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:15.030
 what is this related to some festive 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:19.110
 dinner and on which bound chips 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:22.830
 who are sure to gobble up chips with 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:25.500
 taste of garlic or onion or sour cream 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:32.190
 who knows what kind of chips my God 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:34.919
