00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.700
 good friends of hdblog we are in Milan for 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.799
 the presentation of the gigi 4 we leave 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.440
 talking about the rear bodywork 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.210
 because this is the big novelty shell 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.400
 back which is available both in 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.279
 leather in three different colors of course 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.740
 rear body that is removable there 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.400
 behind the 3000 milliamp battery 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.800
 now you see memory expansion e 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.449
 nano sim then in contrast 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.519
 compared to competitors 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.590
 in addition to this version in leather there is 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.630
 also the plastic version in three 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.989
 color you evict yourself for a second 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.309
 only here it is when plastic version 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.930
 that this in three colors you 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.809
 release ok also here the sensor remains 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.730
 laser for camera focusing from 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.110
 16 megapixels with the double 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.230
 image stabilization on two 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.579
 two serious axes even of excursions 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.489
 on the axis of the aics and 2 degrees on the axis 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.190
 of the y also the flash to a novelty 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.809
 or to a reader of him a rag 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.750
 of lighting temperature 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.479
 and based on the brightness that is present 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.299
 in the environment it regulates the 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.950
 power of the flash we go to light it 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.460
 the display is 5 and a half inches 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.580
 2000 and 1400 40 diagonal for 2500 160 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.710
 definition pixels like g3 but la 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.000
 technology is different they explained to us 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.550
 which is 20 percent brighter 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.160
 much more faithful color reproduction 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.630
 in short, unfortunately we are in the environment 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.310
 very dark so we can't 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.140
 grasp these differences when 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.320
 we will then test it thoroughly 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.270
 surely we hope to notice them 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.270
 camera have been implemented 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.040
 much more advanced professional controls 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.380
 but still the simplicity of use remains 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.410
 see in the classic interface 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.119
 of the camera's camera 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:54.500
 front that has been improved both 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.700
 as a grip but also as an opening e 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.710
 Also as a gesture you can make me the 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.550
 gesture to capture more photos at 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.440
 same instant 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.690
 we are connected under wifi we go to 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.680
 see how it turns chrome that's the only one 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.179
 browser present on this new lg g4 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.800
 see if I go here in the list of 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.600
 impostor settings that seem to me 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.680
 diminished so also here there is a 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.540
 general simplification of 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:19.430
 interfaces that arrive at version 4.0 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.200
 in the settings you see we have the 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.540
 various possibilities for customization 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.250
 uniforms there is the notification we go to 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.049
 see the possibility of the display of 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.239
 put it in brightness of course 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:31.910
 automatic and we have below in the 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:35.269
 phone information we have one 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.840
 version here that will allow 5.1 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.670
 even 5.1 of android already 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.549
 installed will be presented will come 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.010
 marketed in June for 699 euros 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.720
 comma 90 cents back cover in 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.100
 leather included in the true price will not have 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.530
 a surcharge compared to the cover 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:55.130
 traditional one here 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.959
 a shot close to gt3 to say that 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.740
 more or less see the dimensions are the 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.850
 same 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.650
 we hope to have him on trial soon 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.300
 because it is a product that so at first 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.810
 view really looks very much 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.810
 Interesting
