00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.730
 hello friends were this tutorial what 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.170
 I want to dedicate below the video 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.910
 previous that I did to you on already some 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.009
 techniques that are being taught for the 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.810
 that you are starting in spinning and 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.880
 I was talking about the reel of 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.009
 fishing line and there is a moment of 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.579
 show it because when I talk to you about 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:30.230
 I told you that the terminal was the one 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.939
 monofilament furgo carbonell was for 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.420
 that I told him not to see 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:37.160
 because the bad feature so 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.870
 say it is defective that you have the 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.370
 braided is that it's under water like this 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.710
 that we have to need a terminal and 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.539
 we have to unite both children I'm going to 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.120
 teach two very simple knots that 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:49.699
 have worked that is the aldridge knot 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.739
 or when applied in English it's 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:52.940
 Lousy but it is not the best 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.199
 just be that it works for me and 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.579
 I teach it to you because also 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.229
 I understand among all there is very 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.479
 simple but there are many police 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:02.179
 then you must make the ready the wine 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:03.010
 and shelton internight there are many types of 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:04.989
 Dollars 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.990
 and what I 'm going to do is show it 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.400
 with 2 lanyards because it's like 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.990
 will do so for using so that what 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.729
 you see is easier and is more colorful is 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.890
 bigger agree I'll say that 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.270
 this one that is yellow or good this 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.549
 that has many colors like that yellowish 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.619
 If this is going to be fluorocarbon or 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.810
 of monofilament an agreement and this one goes to 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.850
 braiding 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.829
 imagine that this one comes from the cane 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.189
 comes from the cane and is like that 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:33.100
 now we have to join the now comes 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:35.200
 the knot exists very simple we have to 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.960
 catch the fragment demographically 2 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.009
 one and a half meters and make a bullet look 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:45.130
 Look how simple a shovel 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:48.600
 we hold slavic agreement easy sight 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.600
 nothing has changed is a vague 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.460
 now so it's a children's game but 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.690
 so you do not forget forever 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.390
 remember one thing for what you 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.729
 are you starting 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.250
 imagine that it is like a snake that 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.500
 enter a lake 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:09.660
 that comes through here and leave it 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.970
 practically like that hanging with the other 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.400
 You click on the entrance of the studi 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.660
 let go and now you have to look 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:22.920
 you have to 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:24.920
 roll over about you see wheels over 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.950
 and one more 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.380
 and another case once I saw that I had 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.319
 to leave a line to finish 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.840
 agreement 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:38.420
 so once you have it that way you have to 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.120
 search for the place you entered 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.440
 I mean the vague but you see the vague entered 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.610
 as well as a snake that enters the 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.959
 Lake okay then now you have to 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.640
 do it the other way, say you have to do 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.440
 that the snake so to speak comes out 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.270
 where he entered 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.420
 important since this moment arrives 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.310
 your stop dipping the knot moisten it for 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.780
 that when you tighten the abrasion do not damage 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.580
 the knot is very important maybe the most 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.860
 important of the good world for imagine 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.990
 or is sucked or obeyed and then vice 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.980
 pulling you're pulling you're pulling 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.980
 all the strips of all 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.860
 It's costing me a little bit and I'm not saying 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.420
 because this is not he will be the most 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.210
 appropriate to do this of tickets are 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.790
 cords well stays like this 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.440
 once this has been left if what 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.110
 has to do is with a short scissors 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.270
 this extreme and this extreme is to say the 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.360
 two that have been left loose and this 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.460
 it would be more or less okay according to 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.490
 A) Yes 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.440
 this would go to the ra to say to the 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.060
 artificial and this one would be in the cane 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.120
 hung that goes our reel you already have 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.330
 in the union this is the knot back or the 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.770
 bric easy to do and very easy 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.150
 effective do not think that this is lost 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.730
 it breaks or something I was not using 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.650
 practically my whole life in the spin and 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.060
 I've never lost a piece for 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.640
 I never left and I took a piece 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.980
 before quite that good what development 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.180
 showed he showed the following next 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.180
 knot that is practically very graphic 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.560
 and in this next what I'm going to do 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.659
 that is to say is the knot or number two we are going to 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.340
 say the joint knot number two is from 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:10.870
 the family of galp grip so to speak 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.390
 but it's a bit safer or at least what 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.950
 who understand they say that we are going to do what 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.130
 we take the flower or carbon or the 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.940
 monofilament we make a vague and 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.040
 we hold on the low 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.900
 and this time instead of going through 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.210
 up as we did on another occasion 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.560
 let's do it below but let's 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.560
 enter and fix what we are going to do 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:36.520
 another easy vague truth you do not pay and now 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.500
 the braided cow that is the blue the 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.780
 we're not going, we 're not going, we're going to 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.580
 get forgiveness inward towards 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.440
 in inward far more or 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.590
 less 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:51.180
 and here the clamp we go back and with that 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.670
 it was loose we rolled over the three on 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.470
 the three that have been 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.570
 we do not arrive decade after decade after 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.430
 decade ago you see what you know is that it is 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.960
 difficult even with cord was to do it 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.300
 because it's my hands are always going 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.210
 above and all that well once I 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.040
 we have here we have arrived here 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.220
 remember where we enter we enter through 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.780
 down then it goes up 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.660
 in sections from bottom to top and now 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.740
 let's do it like this again with what 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.320
 that I tell you once we have arrived 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.450
 here sucks or moistens the knot for 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.750
 that the abrasion does not damage it and we started 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:25.620
 tense fixes tense saiz of all 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:28.330
 you think of everyone look how it looks 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.220
 this knot I assure you that this is a 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.650
 wonder this knot is a wonder 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.740
 now they cut here we would cut off the 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.890
 two extremes and this would be united 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.890
 A) Yes 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.699
 good friends and I have said is not the 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:43.110
 better what I do, and I'm not the best 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:43.770
 simply this is one of the many 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.130
 waths up 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.449
