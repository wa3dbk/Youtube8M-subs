00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.470 
much the same as a normal Formula One
car<00:04:48.320> you<00:04:49.190> live<00:04:49.370> in<00:04:49.520> the<00:04:49.610> future<00:04:50.000> of<00:04:50.120> the<00:04:50.270> six

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.480 
car you live in the future of the six

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
car you live in the future of the six
wheeled<00:04:50.720> car

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
wheeled car

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.060 
wheeled car
I<00:04:53.180> think<00:04:54.180> that<00:04:54.510> there<00:04:55.170> is<00:04:55.290> a<00:04:55.320> place<00:04:55.620> for<00:04:55.830> it<00:04:55.950> and

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
I think that there is a place for it and

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.040 
I think that there is a place for it and
Grand<00:04:56.250> Prix<00:04:56.400> racing<00:04:56.760> I<00:04:56.880> think<00:04:57.180> that<00:04:57.390> perhaps

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
Grand Prix racing I think that perhaps

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.800 
Grand Prix racing I think that perhaps
it's<00:04:58.530> still<00:04:58.920> a<00:04:58.950> little<00:04:59.280> premature<00:05:00.240> to<00:05:00.300> say

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
it's still a little premature to say

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.050 
it's still a little premature to say
categorically<00:05:01.170> that<00:05:01.860> the<00:05:02.310> six<00:05:02.610> wheel<00:05:02.790> car

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
categorically that the six wheel car

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.180 
categorically that the six wheel car
will<00:05:03.300> be<00:05:03.450> the<00:05:03.570> car<00:05:03.780> of<00:05:03.810> the<00:05:04.050> future<00:05:04.160> but<00:05:05.160> I

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
will be the car of the future but I

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.340 
will be the car of the future but I
think<00:05:05.490> it<00:05:05.640> has<00:05:05.790> a<00:05:05.820> much<00:05:06.150> better<00:05:06.450> chance<00:05:06.900> of

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
think it has a much better chance of

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.520 
think it has a much better chance of
being<00:05:08.250> successful<00:05:08.540> than<00:05:09.540> most<00:05:09.750> people<00:05:10.200> give

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
being successful than most people give

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.340 
being successful than most people give
it<00:05:10.710> when<00:05:11.400> it<00:05:11.550> was<00:05:11.700> first<00:05:11.910> introduced<00:05:12.480> a<00:05:13.020> few

no chance at all I I enjoy today I feel

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.380 
no chance at all I I enjoy today I feel
that<00:05:24.840> I<00:05:25.020> was<00:05:25.290> like<00:05:25.470> a<00:05:26.040> little<00:05:26.850> boy<00:05:27.180> at

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
that I was like a little boy at

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.810 
that I was like a little boy at
Christmastime<00:05:28.169> having<00:05:28.620> been<00:05:29.280> given<00:05:29.460> a<00:05:29.700> great

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
Christmastime having been given a great

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.420 
Christmastime having been given a great
present<00:05:30.390> the<00:05:30.690> privilege<00:05:31.440> of<00:05:31.620> coming<00:05:31.680> back<00:05:32.190> and

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.220 
present the privilege of coming back and
enjoying<00:05:32.880> the<00:05:33.810> adventure<00:05:34.710> of<00:05:34.740> driving<00:05:35.400> this

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:36.230 
enjoying the adventure of driving this

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.870 
enjoying the adventure of driving this
revolutionary<00:05:37.230> new<00:05:37.500> car<00:05:37.740> because<00:05:38.070> I<00:05:38.190> think<00:05:38.250> it

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
revolutionary new car because I think it

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.640 
revolutionary new car because I think it
is<00:05:39.060> the<00:05:39.210> most<00:05:39.330> revolutionary<00:05:39.690> car<00:05:40.410> that's

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
is the most revolutionary car that's

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.950 
is the most revolutionary car that's
come<00:05:40.890> in<00:05:41.040> to<00:05:41.220> Grand<00:05:41.430> Prix<00:05:41.550> racing<00:05:41.970> for<00:05:42.150> her<00:05:42.270> to

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
come in to Grand Prix racing for her to

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.120 
come in to Grand Prix racing for her to
the<00:05:43.530> last<00:05:43.710> two<00:05:43.890> decades<00:05:44.180> so<00:05:45.180> for<00:05:45.540> me<00:05:45.690> I<00:05:46.260> enjoyed

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
the last two decades so for me I enjoyed

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.680 
the last two decades so for me I enjoyed
it<00:05:47.340> I<00:05:47.520> loved<00:05:47.970> it<00:05:48.150> but<00:05:48.450> not<00:05:49.260> for<00:05:49.320> the<00:05:49.560> future
