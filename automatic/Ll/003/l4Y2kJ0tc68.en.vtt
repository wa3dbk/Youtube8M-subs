00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.050
 to see what we can do on this occasion 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.740
 we are seeing that here in the middle 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.230
 there were some greens and some blues me 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.140
 I'm still on the red team so we're going to 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.660

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.059
 servers where and you become invisible and 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.950
 then you have been visible by any 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.700
 thing is very complicated to bother 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.770
 invisible 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.980

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:05.150
 where you can so for the moment 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:08.000
 Well now we can throw ourselves away and 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.960

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.909
 so we have left of this little one that 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:26.909

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.000
 channel where in your view you are going to give 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.060
 mind that we're going to give you some 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.750

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:12.520

 being invisible on this server 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.210
