aren't there there's those that you can
say<00:00:10.620> sort<00:00:10.889> of<00:00:10.919> later<00:00:11.129> in<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.459> year<00:00:11.580> which<00:00:11.969> a

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
say sort of later in the year which a

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.190 
say sort of later in the year which a
bit<00:00:12.599> hard<00:00:12.839> you<00:00:12.929> want<00:00:13.709> earlier<00:00:14.959> these<00:00:15.959> are<00:00:16.020> the

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:16.200 
bit hard you want earlier these are the

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.939 
bit hard you want earlier these are the
ones<00:00:16.430> are<00:00:17.430> autumn<00:00:18.060> autumn<00:00:18.359> sowing<00:00:18.869> ones<00:00:19.080> that

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
ones are autumn autumn sowing ones that

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.250 
ones are autumn autumn sowing ones that
are<00:00:20.130> much<00:00:20.699> harder<00:00:21.179> and<00:00:21.420> they're<00:00:22.050> much

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
are much harder and they're much

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.769 
are much harder and they're much
smoother<00:00:22.830> P<00:00:23.150> these<00:00:24.150> ones<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.599> we're<00:00:24.689> going

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
smoother P these ones that we're going

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.160 
smoother P these ones that we're going
to<00:00:24.840> show<00:00:25.050> today<00:00:25.109> are<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.570> more<00:00:27.570> tender<00:00:27.839> ones

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
to show today are the more tender ones

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.109 
to show today are the more tender ones
which<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.589> so<00:00:28.740> from<00:00:28.980> March<00:00:29.220> onwards<00:00:29.730> really

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
which is so from March onwards really

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.150 
which is so from March onwards really
and<00:00:31.050> they're<00:00:31.380> going<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.560> go<00:00:31.650> straight<00:00:31.980> into

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
and they're going to go straight into

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.370 
and they're going to go straight into
the<00:00:32.310> ground<00:00:32.750> so<00:00:33.750> we're<00:00:33.870> going<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.050> do<00:00:34.170> that

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
the ground so we're going to do that

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.980 
the ground so we're going to do that
today<00:00:34.880> and<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.970> way<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.150> do<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.810> make<00:00:36.840> a

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:36.990 
today and the way you do it is to make a

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.320 
today and the way you do it is to make a
nice<00:00:37.200> wide<00:00:37.500> trench<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:38.130> the<00:00:38.250> soil<00:00:38.490> with<00:00:39.060> a<00:00:39.090> hoe

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:39.330 
nice wide trench in the soil with a hoe

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.200 
nice wide trench in the soil with a hoe
and<00:00:39.630> we'll<00:00:40.410> show<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.620> how<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.920> do<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
and we'll show you how to do that the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.210 
and we'll show you how to do that the
width<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.600> hose<00:00:42.780> blade<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.410> about<00:00:43.530> about

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
width of a hose blade is about about

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.980 
width of a hose blade is about about
right<00:00:44.460> for<00:00:44.730> peas<00:00:44.970> and<00:00:45.360> you're<00:00:45.480> gonna<00:00:45.570> use<00:00:45.810> this

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:45.990 
right for peas and you're gonna use this

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.980 
right for peas and you're gonna use this
to<00:00:46.050> make<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.800> nice<00:00:47.190> wide<00:00:47.490> trench<00:00:47.910> it's<00:00:48.870> gonna

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:48.990 
to make a a nice wide trench it's gonna

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.430 
to make a a nice wide trench it's gonna
be<00:00:49.200> about<00:00:49.320> two<00:00:50.010> inches<00:00:50.310> deep<00:00:51.110> and<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.230> suppose

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
be about two inches deep and I suppose

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.140 
be about two inches deep and I suppose
about<00:00:52.680> six<00:00:52.950> inches<00:00:53.250> across<00:00:53.430> by<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.880> time

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
about six inches across by the time

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.910 
about six inches across by the time
we're<00:00:54.330> finished<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:55.290> we're<00:00:55.440> just<00:00:55.470> rake<00:00:55.770> that

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
we're finished so we're just rake that

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.980 
we're finished so we're just rake that
across<00:00:56.220> the<00:00:56.490> bed<00:00:57.240> as<00:00:57.420> straight<00:00:57.690> as<00:00:57.810> we<00:00:57.930> can

00:00:59.980 --> 00:00:59.990 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.570 

I've<00:01:00.990> got<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.170> straight<00:01:01.470> edge<00:01:01.680> there<00:01:01.950> is<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.130> bit

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:02.580 
I've got a straight edge there is a bit

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.880 
I've got a straight edge there is a bit
of<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.760> guide<00:01:02.910> for<00:01:03.300> me<00:01:03.480> as<00:01:03.600> I'm<00:01:03.750> going<00:01:03.960> going

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
of a guide for me as I'm going going

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.300 
of a guide for me as I'm going going
along<00:01:06.320> so<00:01:07.320> that's<00:01:07.500> literally<00:01:07.770> all<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.130> do

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
along so that's literally all you do

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.090 
along so that's literally all you do
make<00:01:08.729> sure<00:01:08.759> it's<00:01:09.030> got<00:01:09.149> nice<00:01:09.890> bottom<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:13.100> now

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
make sure it's got nice bottom to it now

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.870 
make sure it's got nice bottom to it now
Emma's<00:01:14.369> gonna<00:01:14.460> serve<00:01:14.759> the<00:01:14.880> peas<00:01:15.259> okay<00:01:16.850> time<00:01:17.850> to

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
Emma's gonna serve the peas okay time to

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.989 
Emma's gonna serve the peas okay time to
start<00:01:18.179> sewing<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.539> peas<00:01:18.749> and<00:01:19.579> you<00:01:20.579> say<00:01:20.820> these

00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:20.999 
start sewing the peas and you say these

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:26.840 
start sewing the peas and you say these
in<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.200> zigzag<00:01:23.299> down<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.960> row<00:01:25.460> so<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.520> get<00:01:26.640> sort

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
in a zigzag down the row so you get sort

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.319 
in a zigzag down the row so you get sort
of<00:01:26.880> double<00:01:27.299> double<00:01:27.810> row<00:01:28.369> and<00:01:29.369> about<00:01:29.640> three<00:01:30.240> or

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
of double double row and about three or

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.300 
of double double row and about three or
four<00:01:30.509> inches<00:01:30.539> apart<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:33.590> actually<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.890> like<00:01:35.009> to

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
four inches apart and actually I like to

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.630 
four inches apart and actually I like to
put<00:01:35.490> an<00:01:36.420> extra<00:01:36.689> couple<00:01:36.990> along<00:01:37.350> just<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.399> case

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
put an extra couple along just in case

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.959 
put an extra couple along just in case
one<00:01:39.299> or<00:01:39.329> two<00:01:39.569> failed<00:01:39.929> and<00:01:40.200> don't<00:01:40.319> germinate<00:01:40.969> in

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:41.969 
one or two failed and don't germinate in

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:43.489 
one or two failed and don't germinate in
this<00:01:42.119> case<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.509> mice<00:01:42.719> don't<00:01:43.020> come<00:01:43.200> along<00:01:43.350> and

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:43.499 
this case the mice don't come along and

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:48.349 
this case the mice don't come along and
tie<00:01:43.649> them<00:01:45.979> and<00:01:46.979> that's<00:01:47.130> all<00:01:47.700> there<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.210> it

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:48.359 
tie them and that's all there is to it

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:50.270 
tie them and that's all there is to it
and<00:01:48.539> the<00:01:48.780> next<00:01:49.109> stage<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.829> literally<00:01:50.249> just

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
and the next stage is literally just

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.809 
and the next stage is literally just
covering<00:01:51.119> them<00:01:51.299> over<00:01:51.630> just<00:01:52.109> use<00:01:52.350> your<00:01:52.499> hand<00:01:52.819> if

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
covering them over just use your hand if

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:56.149 
covering them over just use your hand if
you've<00:01:53.969> got<00:01:54.090> really<00:01:54.240> long<00:01:54.359> row<00:01:54.719> you<00:01:55.319> can<00:01:55.530> use<00:01:56.130> a

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
you've got really long row you can use a

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.910 
you've got really long row you can use a
hole<00:01:56.429> just<00:01:57.179> reach<00:01:57.420> over<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.380> seeds<00:01:58.619> need<00:01:58.799> to

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
hole just reach over the seeds need to

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.529 
hole just reach over the seeds need to
be<00:01:59.009> about<00:01:59.219> two<00:01:59.459> inches<00:01:59.789> deep<00:02:00.090> five

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
be about two inches deep five

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.249 
be about two inches deep five
centimeters<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:02.569> just<00:02:03.569> cover<00:02:03.780> them<00:02:03.959> over

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
centimeters and just cover them over

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.480 
centimeters and just cover them over
lightly<00:02:04.469> like<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.100> then<00:02:05.219> we'll<00:02:05.340> give

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
lightly like that and then we'll give

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.489 
lightly like that and then we'll give
them<00:02:05.609> a<00:02:05.670> water<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.689> then<00:02:07.229> we're<00:02:07.319> going<00:02:07.409> to

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:07.499 
them a water and then we're going to

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:09.530 
them a water and then we're going to
start<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.920> new<00:02:07.950> row<00:02:08.280> it's<00:02:08.700> gonna<00:02:08.789> be<00:02:08.970> about<00:02:09.119> 18

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
start a new row it's gonna be about 18

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.140 
start a new row it's gonna be about 18
inches<00:02:09.750> from<00:02:09.990> the<00:02:10.229> first<00:02:10.440> one<00:02:10.710> 45<00:02:11.340> centimeters

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
inches from the first one 45 centimeters

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.360 
inches from the first one 45 centimeters
and<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.480> leaves<00:02:13.140> enough<00:02:13.500> room<00:02:13.650> between<00:02:13.950> the

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
and that leaves enough room between the

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.200 
and that leaves enough room between the
two

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
two

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.690 
two
to<00:02:15.510> put<00:02:15.660> some<00:02:15.840> supports<00:02:16.680> in<00:02:17.010> which<00:02:17.370> can<00:02:17.610> either

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
to put some supports in which can either

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.180 
to put some supports in which can either
be<00:02:17.820> some<00:02:18.120> net<00:02:18.480> sink<00:02:18.720> pin<00:02:19.080> beam<00:02:19.320> netting<00:02:19.770> or

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
be some net sink pin beam netting or

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.510 
be some net sink pin beam netting or
some<00:02:20.430> pea<00:02:20.580> sticks<00:02:21.770> these<00:02:22.770> peas<00:02:23.070> are<00:02:23.250> climbers

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
some pea sticks these peas are climbers

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.490 
some pea sticks these peas are climbers
so<00:02:23.910> they<00:02:24.060> do<00:02:24.120> need<00:02:24.390> support<00:02:24.570> straight<00:02:25.170> away

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
so they do need support straight away

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.800 
so they do need support straight away
otherwise<00:02:26.040> they<00:02:26.220> just<00:02:26.250> flop<00:02:26.640> over<00:02:26.820> it<00:02:27.510> starts

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
otherwise they just flop over it starts

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.440 
otherwise they just flop over it starts
to<00:02:27.870> grow<00:02:27.990> along<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.350> ground

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
to grow along the ground

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.970 
to grow along the ground
the<00:02:30.450> alternative<00:02:30.960> to<00:02:31.080> sign<00:02:31.290> peas<00:02:31.620> straight

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
the alternative to sign peas straight

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.770 
the alternative to sign peas straight
into<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.370> soil<00:02:32.610> is<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.940> sow<00:02:33.120> them<00:02:33.210> into<00:02:33.480> the

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
into the soil is to sow them into the

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.990 
into the soil is to sow them into the
containers<00:02:34.440> like<00:02:34.650> this<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:35.580> we've<00:02:35.790> done<00:02:35.940> that

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
containers like this and we've done that

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.670 
containers like this and we've done that
obviously<00:02:36.570> though<00:02:36.750> if<00:02:36.810> they've<00:02:36.990> come<00:02:37.200> up<00:02:37.230> the

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
obviously though if they've come up the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.280 
obviously though if they've come up the
perfect<00:02:38.100> stage<00:02:38.340> for<00:02:38.370> for<00:02:39.360> planting<00:02:39.780> out<00:02:39.930> if

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
perfect stage for for planting out if

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.900 
perfect stage for for planting out if
actually<00:02:40.590> leave<00:02:41.010> them<00:02:41.190> any<00:02:41.310> longer<00:02:41.520> as<00:02:41.790> they

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
actually leave them any longer as they

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.270 
actually leave them any longer as they
start<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.240> twine<00:02:42.660> together<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:44.040> can't

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
start to twine together and you can't

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.550 
start to twine together and you can't
get<00:02:44.460> them<00:02:44.580> apart<00:02:44.690> without<00:02:45.690> damaging<00:02:46.170> them<00:02:46.290> so

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
get them apart without damaging them so

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.170 
get them apart without damaging them so
we're<00:02:46.650> going<00:02:46.740> to<00:02:46.800> plant<00:02:47.070> these<00:02:47.310> today<00:02:47.580> and

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
we're going to plant these today and

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.240 
we're going to plant these today and
we're<00:02:48.330> going<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.480> use<00:02:48.750> some<00:02:49.440> pea<00:02:49.620> sticks<00:02:49.980> which

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
we're going to use some pea sticks which

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.400 
we're going to use some pea sticks which
are<00:02:50.370> going<00:02:50.490> to<00:02:50.550> go<00:02:50.670> in<00:02:50.820> first<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.540> support<00:02:51.720> them

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.410 

now<00:02:55.410> these<00:02:55.560> are<00:02:55.770> just<00:02:55.970> prunings<00:02:56.970> are<00:02:57.120> from<00:02:57.240> no

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
now these are just prunings are from no

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.090 
now these are just prunings are from no
birch<00:02:57.690> tree<00:02:58.050> we've<00:02:58.200> gotten<00:02:58.470> another<00:02:58.680> part<00:02:58.980> of

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
birch tree we've gotten another part of

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.590 
birch tree we've gotten another part of
the<00:02:59.190> garden<00:02:59.370> but<00:02:59.790> they're<00:03:00.210> ideal<00:03:00.570> for

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
the garden but they're ideal for

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.560 
the garden but they're ideal for
supporting<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.470> peas<00:03:01.970> so<00:03:02.970> we<00:03:03.060> just<00:03:03.210> push<00:03:03.420> them

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
supporting the peas so we just push them

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.180 
supporting the peas so we just push them
well<00:03:03.780> into<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.200> soil<00:03:04.440> looks<00:03:04.830> like<00:03:05.070> we're

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
well into the soil looks like we're

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.710 
well into the soil looks like we're
planting<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.640> mini<00:03:05.820> forest<00:03:06.270> looks<00:03:06.600> a<00:03:06.690> bit

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
planting a mini forest looks a bit

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.170 
planting a mini forest looks a bit
strange<00:03:07.050> but<00:03:08.040> they<00:03:08.550> do<00:03:08.610> need<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:09.030> height

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
strange but they do need the height

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.120 
strange but they do need the height
please<00:03:09.690> are<00:03:09.870> very<00:03:10.020> vigorous<00:03:10.470> and<00:03:10.500> now<00:03:10.800> easily

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
please are very vigorous and now easily

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.110 
please are very vigorous and now easily
reach<00:03:11.520> four<00:03:11.820> feet<00:03:12.060> high<00:03:12.270> so<00:03:13.550> it<00:03:14.550> may<00:03:14.760> look<00:03:14.970> odd

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
reach four feet high so it may look odd

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.150 
reach four feet high so it may look odd
now<00:03:15.390> but<00:03:15.870> they're<00:03:16.620> going<00:03:16.710> to<00:03:16.770> be<00:03:16.950> really

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
now but they're going to be really

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.560 
now but they're going to be really
useful<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.760> peas<00:03:17.970> are<00:03:18.120> going<00:03:18.270> to<00:03:18.330> cling<00:03:18.540> to

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
useful the peas are going to cling to

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.440 
useful the peas are going to cling to
those<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.400> rocket<00:03:20.400> rocket<00:03:20.820> that<00:03:21.090> woods

those and rocket rocket that woods

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.780 
those and rocket rocket that woods
we<00:03:22.170> could<00:03:22.320> put<00:03:22.470> some<00:03:22.500> smaller<00:03:23.010> Twiggy<00:03:23.400> bits<00:03:23.580> in

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
we could put some smaller Twiggy bits in

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.310 
we could put some smaller Twiggy bits in
between<00:03:24.150> just<00:03:24.390> to<00:03:24.540> help<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.810> peas<00:03:25.020> when<00:03:25.230> you

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
between just to help the peas when you

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.510 
between just to help the peas when you
first<00:03:25.500> put<00:03:25.800> them<00:03:25.890> in<00:03:26.070> because<00:03:26.250> they're<00:03:26.400> only

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
first put them in because they're only

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.710 
first put them in because they're only
tiny<00:03:26.790> little<00:03:27.000> plants

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
tiny little plants

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.210 
tiny little plants
yeah<00:03:28.260> don't<00:03:28.530> always<00:03:28.650> grip<00:03:28.950> on<00:03:29.130> the

yeah don't always grip on the
straightaway<00:03:29.580> do<00:03:29.820> them<00:03:30.120> you<00:03:30.270> don't<00:03:30.480> have<00:03:30.780> to

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
straightaway do them you don't have to

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.660 
straightaway do them you don't have to
help<00:03:31.050> him<00:03:31.200> out<00:03:33.800> push<00:03:34.800> those<00:03:35.010> willing<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.460> the

help him out push those willing to the
soil<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:36.180> will<00:03:36.270> firm<00:03:36.510> around<00:03:36.870> at<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.500> base

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
soil and will firm around at the base

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.010 
soil and will firm around at the base
it's<00:03:38.490> best<00:03:38.670> to<00:03:38.790> put<00:03:39.000> these<00:03:39.180> in<00:03:39.390> first<00:03:39.720> before

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
it's best to put these in first before

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.990 
it's best to put these in first before
you<00:03:40.320> plant<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:40.890> peas<00:03:41.280> because<00:03:41.730> you<00:03:41.850> could

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
you plant the peas because you could

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.240 
you plant the peas because you could
damage<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.330> roots<00:03:42.690> of<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.020> piece<00:03:43.290> when<00:03:44.160> you

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
damage the roots of the piece when you

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.130 
damage the roots of the piece when you
inserting<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:44.910> sticks

he's quite a quite a deep hole we've
already<00:04:42.660> prepared<00:04:42.960> this<00:04:43.410> soil<00:04:43.710> it's<00:04:44.460> had<00:04:44.610> some

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
already prepared this soil it's had some

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.570 
already prepared this soil it's had some
fertilizer<00:04:45.360> dug<00:04:45.660> into<00:04:45.870> it<00:04:46.140> about<00:04:46.400> 710<00:04:47.400> days

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
fertilizer dug into it about 710 days

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.030 
fertilizer dug into it about 710 days
ago<00:04:47.940> and<00:04:48.480> that<00:04:48.660> should<00:04:48.870> have<00:04:48.990> got<00:04:49.620> down<00:04:49.800> into

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
ago and that should have got down into

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.560 
ago and that should have got down into
the<00:04:50.160> soil<00:04:50.430> and<00:04:50.580> starting<00:04:50.940> to<00:04:51.000> dissolve<00:04:51.300> that<00:04:51.540> a

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
the soil and starting to dissolve that a

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.210 
the soil and starting to dissolve that a
lot<00:04:51.750> of<00:04:51.780> rain<00:04:52.020> just<00:04:52.050> recently<00:04:52.710> so<00:04:52.980> that<00:04:53.100> we

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
lot of rain just recently so that we

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.640 
lot of rain just recently so that we
have<00:04:53.340> helped<00:04:53.640> now<00:04:54.270> peas<00:04:54.600> are<00:04:54.870> a<00:04:55.050> quite<00:04:55.440> special

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
have helped now peas are a quite special

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.920 
have helped now peas are a quite special
win<00:04:56.160> that<00:04:56.340> they<00:04:56.370> have<00:04:56.910> little<00:04:57.240> nodules<00:04:57.630> on<00:04:57.810> the

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
win that they have little nodules on the

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.630 
win that they have little nodules on the
roots<00:04:58.169> and<00:04:58.530> they'll<00:04:58.680> start<00:04:58.979> to<00:04:59.130> produce<00:04:59.280> their

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
roots and they'll start to produce their

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.159 
roots and they'll start to produce their
own<00:04:59.669> nitrogen<00:05:00.030> so<00:05:00.540> you<00:05:00.630> don't<00:05:00.780> need<00:05:00.900> a<00:05:00.930> lot<00:05:01.140> of

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
own nitrogen so you don't need a lot of

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.740 
own nitrogen so you don't need a lot of
fertilizer<00:05:01.410> in<00:05:02.040> the<00:05:02.070> soil<00:05:02.220> and<00:05:02.700> who<00:05:03.570> would

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
fertilizer in the soil and who would

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.390 
fertilizer in the soil and who would
have<00:05:03.870> all<00:05:04.229> will<00:05:04.380> do<00:05:04.530> is<00:05:04.710> for<00:05:04.919> having<00:05:05.220> dug<00:05:05.370> a

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
have all will do is for having dug a

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.430 
have all will do is for having dug a
hole<00:05:05.640> there<00:05:05.880> is<00:05:06.000> just<00:05:06.150> pop<00:05:06.330> them<00:05:06.479> in<00:05:06.660> try<00:05:07.290> not

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
hole there is just pop them in try not

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.710 
hole there is just pop them in try not
to<00:05:07.560> disturb<00:05:07.890> the<00:05:07.950> roots<00:05:08.340> too<00:05:08.640> much<00:05:08.850> and<00:05:09.600> just

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
to disturb the roots too much and just

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.980 
to disturb the roots too much and just
gently<00:05:10.080> bring<00:05:10.830> the<00:05:10.890> soil<00:05:11.220> round<00:05:11.580> and<00:05:12.090> then

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
gently bring the soil round and then

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.040 
gently bring the soil round and then
just<00:05:13.200> firm<00:05:13.440> them<00:05:13.680> in<00:05:13.830> just<00:05:14.100> very<00:05:14.400> gently<00:05:15.050> now

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
just firm them in just very gently now

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.840 
just firm them in just very gently now
you<00:05:16.110> can<00:05:16.290> see<00:05:16.440> they're<00:05:16.620> still<00:05:16.800> flopping<00:05:17.460> about

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
you can see they're still flopping about

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:18.980 
you can see they're still flopping about
and<00:05:18.120> it's<00:05:18.210> going<00:05:18.330> to<00:05:18.390> take<00:05:18.600> them<00:05:18.750> awhile<00:05:18.840> to

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
and it's going to take them awhile to

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.980 
and it's going to take them awhile to
cling<00:05:19.500> onto<00:05:19.680> the<00:05:20.010> thing<00:05:20.820> onto<00:05:21.000> the<00:05:21.300> supports

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
cling onto the thing onto the supports

that we've got there so we'll just tease

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.750 
that we've got there so we'll just tease
the<00:05:24.450> plants<00:05:24.870> through<00:05:25.140> without<00:05:26.130> damaging<00:05:26.640> them

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
the plants through without damaging them

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.550 
the plants through without damaging them
and<00:05:27.180> just<00:05:27.419> leave<00:05:27.600> them<00:05:27.780> there<00:05:27.990> and<00:05:28.320> the

I wouldn't necessarily have to take the

tubes off if they're paper they can just

go straight in the soil and they'll just

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.540 
go straight in the soil and they'll just

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
like firming and then just lean them

like firming and then just lean them
against<00:06:06.289> the<00:06:06.530> the<00:06:07.460> sticks<00:06:07.930> if<00:06:08.930> you<00:06:09.080> can<00:06:09.349> just

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:10.599 
against the the sticks if you can just

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:13.510 
against the the sticks if you can just
twiddle<00:06:11.599> them<00:06:11.750> in<00:06:11.900> there<00:06:12.139> and<00:06:12.740> before<00:06:13.490> very

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
long as I say they'll start to start to

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:24.380 
long as I say they'll start to start to
grip<00:06:16.729> on
