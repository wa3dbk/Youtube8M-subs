00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.970
 In a world 

00:00:11.399 --> 00:00:13.589
 do not 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.980
 says Luis BuÃ±uel in his indispensable autobiography 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.329
 my last breath 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:21.359
 It has happened to you in bars 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.819
 delicious hours 

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:27.039
 it is for me a place of meditation and meditation 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.789
 without which life is inconceivable 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.260
 old custom strengthened with the years 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.460
 like San Simeon the stylist who from the top his column spoke with his 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.650
 invisible god 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.390
 me in the bars 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.520
 I have spent long periods of sleep 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.770
 talking rarely with the waiter and almost always with myself 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.250
 invaded by collisions of images which more surprising 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.280
 so I've also spent long hours of sleep in bars and talking 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.020
 hungry if with myself 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.050
 but especially with my favorite drink 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.000
 that was the second b 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.820
 that the king is dry 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.630
 the real Madrid 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.740
 puyol eric cobo some pages my last sigh to this drink 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.760
 and they want to share them and according to him 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.380
 just like all the papers probably the problem you have a 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.220
 American invention 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.310
 basically it's made up 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.120
 from gin 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.070
 and some boots we will have 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.830
 preferably 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.180
 does not invite 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.560
 the good tasters who take the auction and very dry have even said 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.430
 it's enough to let a ray of sunlight pass through a bottle of wine and 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.340
 prats before giving 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.150
 in the glass of g 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.160
 a time when in North America it was said that a story to the malki 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.990
 it should look like the conception of the virgin 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.770
 indeed you already know what according to saint tomÃ¡s de aquino 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.090
 the generating power of holy spirit went through the crime of the virgin 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.940
 like a ray of sun goes through a crystal 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.650
 without breaking 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.720
 then you just have to try the same 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.890
 and according to him 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.109
 it seems to me 

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:09.759
 an exaggeration 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.029
 and here that also seems to me an exaggeration that's why I make the martinis 

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:17.069
 the way stirs 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.739
 what first 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.419
 took the vermouth the lawyers 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:23.099
 and vier pto 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.019
 a few very few 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.079
 2. 3 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.879
 we must in the cup with those more 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.219
 how much 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:34.650
 what I do is that with those boots I'm going to tie 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:40.209
 the boyle cup covering it with a fini and if a movie 

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:42.230
 d of the world 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.389
 French 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:47.999
 that is dry that the only thing you are going to do is to perfume very subtly 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:50.519
 on Tuesday 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.969
 is already if we get closer we can see even 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:55.849
 the tears of vermouth 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.030
 prefigure the best we believe it then produce the martinis 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.199
 the bank 

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:04.339
 then it comes of course 

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:06.909
 although of course to brazil 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:09.519
 the olive is noted between ascer 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.109
 and is that fred aster who was also knowledgeable in the matter 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.109
 he said he did not like poplar martinis 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.769
 to me yes it will be because I like the apple country with vanilla ice cream and so 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.919
 I pay a small tribute 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:24.859
 and now yes 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.689
 the gin always 23 for me 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:32.629
 the abbot therefore does not exempt her from quoting or scrambling because I gin the 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.099
 sentence enter the freezer 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.149
 completely frozen 

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:38.399
 to be 

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:41.879
 the silver bullet that is from the beginning 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:47.569
 and no longer the cup to the edge a martini should always do nothing until 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.499
 the edge as seen here 

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:52.299
 per case the access experience 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.759
 measured excess is like that 

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:57.499
 because I also like to pay attention to him 

00:03:57.499 --> 00:04:00.499
 to dorothy parker that great American poet 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.279
 and say with her that 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:06.039
 to the malki whatever it is like this 

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:08.399
 put a rhythm of the bad 

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:10.779
 lectern both 

00:04:10.779 --> 00:04:13.479
 asfour to lower 

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:15.209
 the little one rides the bell 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.579
 surely it is my conscience 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.150
 I still hope salinas wife Jorge Martin 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.150
 and on the sides 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:32.770
 there is
