00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:26.950 
worked up about it a little upset so I

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.310 
worked up about it a little upset so I
went<00:00:27.310> to<00:00:27.430> the<00:00:27.550> health<00:00:28.090> food<00:00:28.270> store<00:00:28.329> today<00:00:28.750> well

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
went to the health food store today well

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.620 
went to the health food store today well
first<00:00:29.349> of<00:00:29.739> all<00:00:29.800> let<00:00:30.009> me<00:00:30.040> let<00:00:30.279> me<00:00:30.369> back<00:00:30.489> up<00:00:30.630> I

first of all let me let me back up I

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.410 
first of all let me let me back up I
started<00:00:32.380> hearing<00:00:32.710> at<00:00:33.010> the<00:00:33.190> gym<00:00:33.489> and<00:00:33.850> all<00:00:34.180> these

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
started hearing at the gym and all these

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.800 
started hearing at the gym and all these
places<00:00:34.810> that<00:00:35.260> there's<00:00:35.829> this<00:00:36.010> great<00:00:36.640> new<00:00:37.000> water

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:37.810 
places that there's this great new water

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.530 
places that there's this great new water
that<00:00:38.739> is<00:00:39.130> like<00:00:39.370> 9<00:00:40.230> pH<00:00:41.230> and<00:00:41.740> it's<00:00:42.580> awesome<00:00:42.850> for

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.540 
that is like 9 pH and it's awesome for

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.690 
that is like 9 pH and it's awesome for
you<00:00:43.810> and<00:00:44.080> it'll<00:00:44.200> help<00:00:44.500> heal<00:00:44.860> your<00:00:45.130> body<00:00:45.310> and<00:00:45.640> I

you and it'll help heal your body and I

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.640 
you and it'll help heal your body and I
thought<00:00:45.910> wow<00:00:46.570> that's<00:00:46.900> really<00:00:47.260> good<00:00:47.440> so<00:00:47.590> I've

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
thought wow that's really good so I've

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:48.990 
thought wow that's really good so I've
been<00:00:47.740> hearing<00:00:48.100> about<00:00:48.220> it<00:00:48.550> and<00:00:48.580> hearing<00:00:48.820> about

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
been hearing about it and hearing about

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.920 
been hearing about it and hearing about
it<00:00:49.270> and<00:00:49.360> hearing<00:00:49.600> about<00:00:49.810> it<00:00:49.960> and<00:00:50.490> I<00:00:51.630> went<00:00:52.630> down

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
it and hearing about it and I went down

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.390 
it and hearing about it and I went down
to<00:00:53.080> the<00:00:53.170> health<00:00:53.320> food<00:00:53.470> store<00:00:53.530> today<00:00:53.980> and<00:00:54.250> I

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400 
to the health food store today and I

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.660 
to the health food store today and I
ended<00:00:54.430> up<00:00:54.910> buying<00:00:55.870> it<00:00:56.200> it's<00:00:57.100> called<00:00:57.280> aqua

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
ended up buying it it's called aqua

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.470 
ended up buying it it's called aqua
hydrate<00:00:58.090> and<00:00:58.840> if<00:00:59.830> you<00:01:00.100> don't<00:01:00.310> know<00:01:00.579> it's<00:01:01.030> I

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
hydrate and if you don't know it's I

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.799 
hydrate and if you don't know it's I
don't<00:01:01.900> think<00:01:02.079> it's<00:01:02.320> made<00:01:02.880> by<00:01:03.880> Mark<00:01:04.239> Wahlberg

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
don't think it's made by Mark Wahlberg

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.740 
don't think it's made by Mark Wahlberg
and<00:01:05.049> P<00:01:05.560> Diddy<00:01:05.829> think<00:01:06.520> they<00:01:06.640> just<00:01:06.670> endorsed<00:01:07.420> it

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
and P Diddy think they just endorsed it

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.690 
and P Diddy think they just endorsed it
okay<00:01:08.650> but<00:01:09.159> right<00:01:10.060> on<00:01:10.240> here<00:01:10.750> that<00:01:11.460> little<00:01:12.460> red

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
okay but right on here that little red

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.770 
okay but right on here that little red
it<00:01:13.359> says

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
it says

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.359

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
explanation of what pH is and you know

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.400 
explanation of what pH is and you know
on<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.329> pH<00:02:07.659> scale<00:02:07.689> and<00:02:08.530> all<00:02:08.770> that<00:02:09.009> I<00:02:10.410> think

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
on the pH scale and all that I think

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.070 
on the pH scale and all that I think
that<00:02:11.680> was

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
that was

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.030 
that was
yeah<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.010> says<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.430> pH<00:02:14.990> number<00:02:15.990> is<00:02:16.290> the

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
yeah it says the pH number is the

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.500 
yeah it says the pH number is the
standard<00:02:18.020> measurement<00:02:19.020> of<00:02:19.640> Alken<00:02:20.640> alkalinity

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
outgo and G the higher the pH the more

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.640 
outgo and G the higher the pH the more
alkaline<00:02:26.700> something<00:02:27.330> is<00:02:27.570> products<00:02:28.440> with

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
alkaline something is products with

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.510 
alkaline something is products with
higher<00:02:29.120> alkalinity<00:02:30.120> are<00:02:30.450> more<00:02:31.250> likely<00:02:32.250> to

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
higher alkalinity are more likely to

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:39.380 
higher alkalinity are more likely to
help<00:02:33.410> detoxify<00:02:34.610> excess<00:02:35.610> acid<00:02:36.860> waste<00:02:38.150> that<00:02:39.150> can

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
help detoxify excess acid waste that can

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.350 
help detoxify excess acid waste that can
lead<00:02:39.660> to<00:02:39.690> sluggishness<00:02:40.640> laws<00:02:41.640> of<00:02:41.940> strength

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
lead to sluggishness laws of strength

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.960 
lead to sluggishness laws of strength
and<00:02:42.720> decreased<00:02:43.620> bone<00:02:44.100> and<00:02:44.400> muscle<00:02:44.700> health<00:02:46.970> so

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
and decreased bone and muscle health so

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.080 
and decreased bone and muscle health so
I<00:02:48.330> went<00:02:49.080> to<00:02:49.170> my<00:02:49.380> health<00:02:49.620> food<00:02:49.830> store<00:02:50.190> I<00:02:50.490> paid

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
I went to my health food store I paid

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.500 
I went to my health food store I paid
like<00:02:51.300> three<00:02:51.600> dollars<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.890> 25<00:02:53.580> cents<00:02:54.090> for<00:02:54.360> this

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
like three dollars and 25 cents for this

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.410 
like three dollars and 25 cents for this
and<00:02:55.160> I<00:02:56.160> bought<00:02:56.700> it<00:02:56.850> home

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
and I bought it home

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.730 
and I bought it home
so<00:02:57.540> I'm<00:02:57.630> sitting<00:02:57.990> in<00:02:58.050> my<00:02:58.170> living<00:02:58.380> room<00:02:58.530> a

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
so I'm sitting in my living room a

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.630 
so I'm sitting in my living room a
little<00:02:58.860> bit<00:02:58.980> ago<00:03:01.220> and<00:03:02.220> you<00:03:02.340> know<00:03:02.459> what

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
little bit ago and you know what

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.030 
little bit ago and you know what
actually<00:03:03.090> it<00:03:03.180> tastes<00:03:03.510> pretty<00:03:03.720> good<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:04.680> takes

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
actually it tastes pretty good it takes

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:12.680 
actually it tastes pretty good it takes
it<00:03:05.640> tastes<00:03:05.970> really<00:03:06.240> clean<00:03:07.670> but<00:03:08.670> I<00:03:11.300> just<00:03:12.300> happen

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
it tastes really clean but I just happen

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.490 
it tastes really clean but I just happen
to<00:03:12.720> have<00:03:12.840> pH<00:03:13.709> strips<00:03:14.220> because<00:03:15.209> when<00:03:15.959> I<00:03:16.170> go<00:03:16.350> out

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
to have pH strips because when I go out

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.220 
to have pH strips because when I go out
to<00:03:16.530> meet<00:03:17.220> with<00:03:17.250> clients<00:03:17.810> one<00:03:18.810> of<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:18.989> things

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
to meet with clients one of the things

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.949 
to meet with clients one of the things
that<00:03:19.380> I<00:03:19.410> do<00:03:19.530> is<00:03:19.890> I<00:03:20.040> check<00:03:20.070> their<00:03:20.519> pH<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:21.570> see<00:03:21.780> how

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
that I do is I check their pH to see how

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.370 
that I do is I check their pH to see how
acidic<00:03:22.350> their<00:03:22.650> body<00:03:22.890> is<00:03:23.130> so<00:03:24.000> I<00:03:24.330> went<00:03:24.989> into<00:03:25.140> my

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
acidic their body is so I went into my

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.650 
acidic their body is so I went into my
bathroom<00:03:25.830> and<00:03:26.459> I<00:03:26.580> grabbed<00:03:26.820> my<00:03:27.000> pH<00:03:27.780> strips<00:03:29.660> what

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
bathroom and I grabbed my pH strips what

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.440 
bathroom and I grabbed my pH strips what
they<00:03:30.780> look<00:03:30.989> like<00:03:31.610> okay<00:03:32.610> and<00:03:32.910> then<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:36.180> pH

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
they look like okay and then the pH

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:44.870 
they look like okay and then the pH
strips<00:03:36.989> come<00:03:37.850> with<00:03:38.850> a<00:03:38.880> pH<00:03:39.330> chart<00:03:41.030> so<00:03:42.030> I<00:03:43.880> grab

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
strips come with a pH chart so I grab

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.600 
strips come with a pH chart so I grab
some<00:03:44.910> of<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.330> water

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
some of the water

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.780 
some of the water
oh<00:03:47.410> yeah<00:03:48.410> and<00:03:48.710> spilled<00:03:49.010> it<00:03:49.130> all<00:03:49.190> over<00:03:49.280> my<00:03:49.460> bed

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.990 

grab<00:03:52.790> some<00:03:52.970> of<00:03:53.000> the<00:03:53.120> water<00:03:53.270> I<00:03:54.160> dipped<00:03:55.160> my<00:03:55.310> pH

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
grab some of the water I dipped my pH

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.330 
grab some of the water I dipped my pH
strip<00:03:56.420> in<00:03:56.540> it<00:03:56.690> I<00:03:56.900> even<00:03:57.470> left<00:03:57.770> it<00:03:57.920> in<00:03:58.040> there<00:03:58.160> for

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
strip in it I even left it in there for

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:08.590 
strip in it I even left it in there for
a<00:03:58.370> little<00:03:58.520> bit<00:03:59.620> okay<00:04:04.630> and<00:04:05.630> then<00:04:05.840> I<00:04:07.420> checked<00:04:08.420> it

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
a little bit okay and then I checked it

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:21.880 
a little bit okay and then I checked it
up<00:04:09.230> against<00:04:09.740> my<00:04:10.060> pH<00:04:11.590> and<00:04:15.640> 6.0<00:04:19.090> 6.0<00:04:20.530> this<00:04:21.530> water

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
up against my pH and 6.0 6.0 this water

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:30.160 
up against my pH and 6.0 6.0 this water
is<00:04:22.190> not<00:04:22.790> 9<00:04:23.780> plus<00:04:25.150> so<00:04:26.150> I<00:04:27.460> wonder<00:04:28.480> how<00:04:29.480> many

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
is not 9 plus so I wonder how many

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:37.030 
is not 9 plus so I wonder how many
people<00:04:30.880> buy<00:04:31.880> this<00:04:32.210> a<00:04:33.070> wrap<00:04:34.900> for<00:04:35.900> three<00:04:36.800> dollars

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
people buy this a wrap for three dollars

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.840 
people buy this a wrap for three dollars
and<00:04:37.610> 25<00:04:38.000> cents<00:04:38.620> actually<00:04:39.620> believing<00:04:40.370> that

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
and 25 cents actually believing that

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.080 
and 25 cents actually believing that
they<00:04:41.150> are<00:04:41.180> gonna<00:04:41.450> be<00:04:41.600> getting<00:04:42.080> a<00:04:42.410> water<00:04:43.400> that

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
they are gonna be getting a water that

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.770 
they are gonna be getting a water that
is<00:04:44.360> pH<00:04:45.260> 9<00:04:46.100> plus<00:04:46.670> because<00:04:47.180> they<00:04:47.330> want<00:04:47.540> to<00:04:47.630> hire

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
is pH 9 plus because they want to hire

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.960 
is pH 9 plus because they want to hire
their<00:04:47.990> pH<00:04:48.320> to<00:04:48.890> make<00:04:49.040> themselves<00:04:49.250> healthier

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
their pH to make themselves healthier

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.060 
their pH to make themselves healthier
and<00:04:50.180> they<00:04:50.720> end<00:04:50.960> up<00:04:51.140> drinking<00:04:51.919> water<00:04:52.370> that's

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
and they end up drinking water that's

00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:00.730 
and they end up drinking water that's
6.0<00:04:55.070> it's<00:04:55.850> not<00:04:56.710> it's<00:04:57.710> not<00:04:57.919> even<00:04:59.470> let<00:05:00.470> me<00:05:00.530> check

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
6.0 it's not it's not even let me check

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.920 
6.0 it's not it's not even let me check
let<00:05:01.040> me<00:05:01.280> check<00:05:01.340> my<00:05:01.520> pH<00:05:01.910> before<00:05:02.180> I<00:05:02.360> say<00:05:02.570> that

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.330 

yeah<00:05:05.930> it's<00:05:06.560> not<00:05:06.770> even<00:05:06.980> in<00:05:07.220> the<00:05:07.250> alkaline<00:05:07.880> zone

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
yeah it's not even in the alkaline zone

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.080 
yeah it's not even in the alkaline zone
6.0<00:05:10.340> to<00:05:10.940> 6.5<00:05:11.660> is<00:05:11.960> the<00:05:12.200> acid<00:05:12.830> zone<00:05:13.160> so<00:05:13.790> this<00:05:13.940> is

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
6.0 to 6.5 is the acid zone so this is

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.900 
6.0 to 6.5 is the acid zone so this is
this<00:05:14.600> water<00:05:14.900> is<00:05:15.110> acidic<00:05:17.050> so<00:05:18.050> I<00:05:18.520> just<00:05:19.520> wanted<00:05:19.820> to

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
this water is acidic so I just wanted to

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.730 
this water is acidic so I just wanted to
do<00:05:20.030> this<00:05:20.210> real<00:05:20.480> quick<00:05:20.510> and<00:05:20.990> let<00:05:21.380> you<00:05:21.530> guys<00:05:21.680> know
