00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.649 
of upright rows I know for a lot of
people<00:01:26.920> this<00:01:27.130> is<00:01:27.190> an<00:01:27.520> awkward<00:01:27.940> exercise<00:01:28.450> to

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
people this is an awkward exercise to

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.230 
people this is an awkward exercise to

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
perform it can be awkward on the wrist

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.690 
perform it can be awkward on the wrist
joint<00:01:31.479> when<00:01:31.929> you<00:01:32.049> roll<00:01:32.500> the<00:01:32.649> Vairo<00:01:32.860> and<00:01:33.280> it<00:01:33.580> can

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
joint when you roll the Vairo and it can

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.160

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
flexibility and better range of motion

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.389 
flexibility and better range of motion
so<00:01:45.600> all<00:01:46.600> we're<00:01:46.780> doing<00:01:47.020> here<00:01:47.259> is<00:01:47.440> performing

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
and a rope attachment and this

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.649 
and a rope attachment and this
combination<00:01:54.039> right<00:01:54.459> here<00:01:54.670> allows<00:01:55.390> you<00:01:55.569> to

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.550 
flexibility and freedom of movement in
your<00:02:00.820> hand<00:02:01.060> positions<00:02:01.539> because<00:02:02.229> when<00:02:02.439> you're

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
your hand positions because when you're

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.440 
your hand positions because when you're
using<00:02:02.680> a<00:02:02.920> rope<00:02:03.130> obviously<00:02:03.700> your<00:02:03.850> hands<00:02:04.240> can

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
using a rope obviously your hands can

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.929 
using a rope obviously your hands can
move<00:02:04.689> with<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.530> rope<00:02:05.710> so<00:02:06.189> you're<00:02:06.340> not<00:02:06.430> fixed

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
move with the rope so you're not fixed

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.029 
move with the rope so you're not fixed
into<00:02:07.329> that<00:02:07.450> rigid<00:02:07.960> plane<00:02:08.229> of<00:02:08.410> motion<00:02:08.590> that<00:02:08.950> you

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
into that rigid plane of motion that you

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.650 
into that rigid plane of motion that you
are<00:02:09.190> when<00:02:09.429> you're<00:02:09.549> grabbing<00:02:09.759> onto<00:02:10.060> a<00:02:10.209> barbell

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
are when you're grabbing onto a barbell

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.080 
are when you're grabbing onto a barbell
and<00:02:10.899> thus<00:02:11.530> this<00:02:11.709> makes<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.130> exercise<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.880> lot

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
and thus this makes the exercise a lot

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.750 
and thus this makes the exercise a lot
more<00:02:13.299> comfortable<00:02:13.810> so<00:02:14.410> if<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:14.799> find<00:02:15.010> barbell

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
more comfortable so if you find barbell

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.270 
more comfortable so if you find barbell
upright<00:02:16.150> rows<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:16.750> bit<00:02:16.959> awkward<00:02:17.170> on<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.829> wrists

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
upright rows a bit awkward on the wrists

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.729 
upright rows a bit awkward on the wrists
or<00:02:18.489> on<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.820> shoulder<00:02:19.150> joint<00:02:19.390> give<00:02:20.109> this<00:02:20.320> cable

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
or on the shoulder joint give this cable

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.710 
or on the shoulder joint give this cable
variation<00:02:21.250> a<00:02:21.340> try<00:02:21.549> and<00:02:21.790> you<00:02:22.359> should<00:02:22.510> be<00:02:22.600> able

variation a try and you should be able
to<00:02:22.810> do<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.109> exercise<00:02:23.140> a<00:02:23.950> lot<00:02:24.370> more

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549
