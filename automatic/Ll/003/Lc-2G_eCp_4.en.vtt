00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.370
 We were then welcome though the wife I hate Peter Wimmer 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.940
 and Christians are from the newly renovated Theater im Pfalzbau in 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.570
 Ludwigshafen 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.320
 I have the final of the fourth international choreography tonight 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.080
 Competition right there is seen 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.150
 unstrut-hainich-kreis 100 applicants 18 were selected for the competition 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.170
 8 contact and are against each other this evening the interrogators 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.800
 What was the most impressive moment for her tonight? Yeah 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.020
 at the end of the day, that is really the choreography of the moment 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.600
 Prize winners from China 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.750
 And last but not least we see in the semifinal stand is not 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:30.470
 really 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.370
 incredible 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.620
 taken in Baden and tied up 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.350
 supported 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.620
 how the threshold at Dr develop this area 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.040
 March adjourned therefore at Norderney 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.040
 Tonight the winners were distributed as they were Elvis 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.580
 Schofield argues that they are still far from discussing 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.990
 who in the encounter I sought in Cairns is something new 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.900
 at forms of expression probably not the conventional fort 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.980
 Nowadays the dancers are excellently prepared. Franz has them 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.089
 Fantastic trained but good design 

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:11.749
 it is very nice 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:13.139
 and this group 

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:19.499
 In Formula One now he has been training fantastic innovative Christian in front 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:21.579
 Thiel the guys have 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:23.559
 middle of March 

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:25.430
 it is a cool development 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.769
 who wins 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.149
 it's almost not one 

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:29.589
 not seldom go 

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:32.939
 a Mintal I have no topic 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:37.739
 that means we will be so shy of what the target area can do 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.649
 West itself 

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:41.249
 next to the men's choir de 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:43.279
 I'm thinking 'what do you want?' 

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:45.929
 In any case, what we offer is her 

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:48.520
 have an excellent effect 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.030
 and 14 the sources move from a single commitment 

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:56.090
 False ceilings ready 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.019
 until you get a whole 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.479
 in the 71st 

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:02.479
 Woven is pretty embarrassing 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:07.319
 that was he just the abstract that piece may have the country has 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:08.070
 could 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.589
 why exactly is he so touched in the play? 

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:13.889
 right to the first impression right now may ask like a 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:17.909
 Attitude a candle from the music train percent lie 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.759
 because only concert halls in the world played 

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:23.709
 but I've still seen it more often 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.159
 Everytime where is seen 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:31.319
 I see translated stocks from quite four that is achieved 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.119
 and what also saw an ideational subtleties itself 

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:39.769
 he develops and evolves and is touched me a lot i do not think so 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.069
 only abstract 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.869
 and second place second place can not train so only be 

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:49.139
 So the topic 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:52.240
 a big surprise for everyone that has the couple 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.529
 they were to become Ottensoos, especially Cie 

00:03:55.529 --> 00:03:59.899
 as a declaration to the team in the medieval 2 1 front in a way 

00:03:59.899 --> 00:04:00.359
 past 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.019
 like the single values ​​he says this gives 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:03.929
 there 

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:08.200
 around we do not have as much off the FDIC scene as an earthquake 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.069
 Dillhausen II 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:11.850
 im 19 really 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.779
 a turnaround sees that here next to the meeting 

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:16.049
 the beige 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.349
 the «extremely changes» 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:19.829
 give with 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.330
 with Philipp Konzett Polenz tour and in 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.080
 in the happen 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.680
 and parents have the US on them and work with defeated ones and they never have 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.150
 secret at the moment 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.210
 there is something missing 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.240
 there is no need to be there is the shark 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.930
 from the two and 8 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.460
 because a corner ball can provide 80 stores 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.460
 Andy Rihs 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:57.539
 they write that the choreographies the four-legged Berlin want to show up 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:59.469
 have to get involved in reality 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:02.719
 what exactly is meant by that or what does one have to do 

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:05.930
 Choreography have to dance around a gang with the reality 

00:05:05.929 --> 00:05:09.379
 May not get involved so i am interested in technology topics 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:12.550
 Bottrop is the biggest chance 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.080
 Prince of Rare from the left in pink sky blue that is 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.969
 No question for kids though 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:23.369
 right for an adult person whose life is up and percent 

00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:25.529
 hopefully also thinks politically and yourself 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:28.210
 Rek one or the other committed percent 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.439
 I do not have to look at Roses are for me team 

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:34.269
 These are also part of childhood in the markets 

00:05:34.269 --> 00:05:35.469
 beautiful 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:39.539
 and that's why I wish for me on stage just mystical choreographies sec 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:41.550
 which 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.539
 with life with the problem with the beautiful things whatever in 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:50.029
 Different aspects of our today can deal with one's life 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:14.460
 It offers space for the rest of the celebrated "I hold Pakistan so far 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.029
 I found that played very well 

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:19.059
 I can not say 

00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:20.150
 where is she 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.469
 Dietmar Haaf 

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:26.369
 CEO nearby holding free also again after that 

00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:27.809
 their limits 

00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:28.889
 January 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:31.029
 title St 

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:35.360
 consistently protesting with a Mac again and again 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:41.210
 in full swing from the CeBIT now goes from two percent the parents want and 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.900
 but I do not miss one 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.900
 I thought it was terrific 

00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:50.369
 the 

00:06:57.719 --> 00:07:00.719
 the 

00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:13.629
 the 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:27.149
 regardless of the winners among the other competitors afterwards 

00:07:27.149 --> 00:07:32.429
 I'm from my dear but we've got the Sharks very much now 

00:07:32.429 --> 00:07:34.099
 he does not come 

00:07:34.099 --> 00:07:36.689
 who is also a member SID 

00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:39.020
 he DIB have it on 

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.020
 in a mold incorporating Butt the 

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.159
 the relationship is over 

00:07:45.159 --> 00:07:46.699
 there are 

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:49.699
 that means everything sees the phone be covered Noreau 

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:55.180
 if it is not a parental leave Pforzheim more than two years indicative 

00:07:58.199 --> 00:08:00.379
 as hostess 

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:01.409
 the growth 

00:08:01.409 --> 00:08:02.919
 worth seeing 

00:08:02.919 --> 00:08:05.919
 Müller we have a lot of looks 

00:08:06.509 --> 00:08:08.589
 in the mountains at the stocks
