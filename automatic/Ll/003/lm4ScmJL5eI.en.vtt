00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hi youtube addicts i am a man and 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.770
 this is the first kendo video that 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.170
 I present my assistant to a 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.650
 mysterious strange stranger that nobody 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:17.100
 you know but you can tell me hello like 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.930
 as good as I could not think of a topic 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.990
 I had the best idea to make this video 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.670
 about curiosities of pokemon the most 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.460
 Trivia I took them from 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.490
 wikileaks good start with the 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.529
 curiosities wait before I say that 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.600
 some curiosities explain things 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.300
 fictitious so do not come with a 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.579
 Comment like that fucking fucking geek 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.469
 they're just little pictures that do not even have 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.200
 ass also these can do what 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.289
 be that eat with the legs click pd 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.149
 good if you can put a comment like that 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.190
 but it will not be worth it because I already said that 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.890
 some curiosities explain things 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.520
 dummy well now yes I start with 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.520
 the curiosities 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.040
 to bat has no eyes and do not go to 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.780
 say that you can learn anything from eye 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.000
 apart from that in video games it's 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.840
 affected by movements like malicious 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.840
 you will be fair 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.160
 besides his bat the sleeping pokemon 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.780
 they are also affected by these 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.620
 movements and by skill 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.620
 intimidation 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.030
 the flying-type pokemon are immune 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.119
 to earth-type attacks again 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.060

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.560

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.049
 asleep 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.149
 perhaps they also fly asleep in the 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.130
 videogames if you sleep a pokemon of 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:48.329
