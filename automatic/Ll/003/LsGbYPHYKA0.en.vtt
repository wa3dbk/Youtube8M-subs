00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.900
 here is how it is promised that it will show 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.480
 how do I advertise which one 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.900
 puff pastry so take it home 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:22.619
 I pulled it with a wizz air bag 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:24.720
 this is what the porcupine lug is like 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.810
 tin stick that you will find 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.929
 stromae on the market in supermarkets e 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:36.690
 I work like this with my thumb I hold the 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:39.420
 part while I ride it like this is fixed 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.890
 with the thumb some to the file and 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.550
 on the other hand, I do the same job 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.550
 so 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:53.510
 then we have some pastors we put them 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.680
 in the fridge after which because it wets the 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.640
 pre we will make a mesh with water and 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.739
 sugar 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:03.589
 we all hope so and hopefully with a 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:05.930
 true here now or promise this 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:09.670
 I stress codyeco and sugar with a 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.670
 spiral brush all the cannoncini so 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:16.070
 and I put myself in a pan or with del 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.939
 baking paper or a silicon mat 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.939
 this way here 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.200
 here's the last thing we put of 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:40.259
 sugars love in this case but only 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.030
 icing sugar and sugar 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.030
 directly above that they decided so 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.960
 over time I used granulated sugar 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.400
 however, considering that with icing sugar 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.270
 on the money a little better in cooking 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:08.420
 candy visit just put in 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:14.720
 charcoal here is growing of 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:17.440
 volume may be what it will have to 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.440
 succeed
