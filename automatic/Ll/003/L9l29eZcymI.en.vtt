00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.130 
iPhone steady due to its slim design but
with<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.700> M<00:01:47.790> come<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.299> adds<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.630> little<00:01:48.899> bit<00:01:49.020> of

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
with the M come it adds a little bit of

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.050

needed<00:01:49.470> bulk<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.890> weight<00:01:50.130> which<00:01:50.850> really

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
needed bulk and weight which really

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.810 
needed bulk and weight which really
helps<00:01:51.329> with<00:01:51.420> shooting<00:01:51.689> photos<00:01:51.899> on<00:01:52.200> videos<00:01:52.820> it
