00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:12.790
 earth blue planet 70 percent with 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:16.500
 surface of the earth is covered with water 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.500
 water is the source of life 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.920
 70 percent of the human body 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:26.580
 water is 75 percent of ours 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:30.520
 brain heart and muscle 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:34.690
 83 percent of our blood and 86 percent 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:36.489
 our lungs are made of water every day 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.580
 we need from 2 to 2 and a half 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.330
 liters of water to satisfy 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.870
 the physiological requirements of our 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.660
 of the body 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.940
 that's why we feel tired and 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.830
 lose concentration when 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.260
 water content in the body drops to 2 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.910
 percent have a serious problem 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.870
 with health once this figure 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.710
 drops by 9 percent 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.320
 balanced water content 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:03.800
 necessary for the functioning of any 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:06.800
 body cells water source of life 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:10.130
 but what kind of water should we drink authorized 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.200
 which is about 25 thousand people daily 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.770
 this lack of water or from 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.380
 polluted water 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.329
 introducing more than 800 contaminants found 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.579
 substances and their amount world bias 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:23.810
 is increasing 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:26.360
 people are dangerous substances 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.130
 dissolved in water and accumulated in 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.950
 Our body is called and 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.100
 chronic diseases after many years 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.810
 when we get sick we associate 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.009
 cause of your poor health with 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.009
 bad water consumption 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:48.170
 tap water may contain 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:52.899
 mercury zinc lead and arsenic 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:57.310
 have iron chlorine pesticides 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:59.720
 nitrates and nitrites radioactive elements 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.640
 streets of bottled water solution 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.619
 problems and you soloists would drink water 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.240
 which you in public bottle a month ago 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.399
 the rest of the money to buy 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.750
 that kind of water you like to carry daily 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.519
 home a few pounds 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.840
 have you ever thought about 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.849
 amount of trash 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.120
 formed from empty bottles from under 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.440
 water whether mechanical filters 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.980
 he solved problems 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.040

 in detachment 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.890
 drink and cross clean water which 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.020
 conceived nature do you think that's 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.360
 a little awkward or even impossible 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.880
 because you live far from the mountain 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.730
 glaciers it's just 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.860
 use occur in a car 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.540
 you among all the filters for more often its water 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.909
 and your own source 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.530
 crystal clear water right from your 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:01.160
 cocoon 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.160
 continuity 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.430
 you stage you prefilter 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.790
 high power filter solid 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.590
 sediments for large particles i 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.590
 in the morning two hundredths of a millimeter and more 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.170
 For fine filtering, I will give you back 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.900
 another 4 times delaying particles where 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.500
 we are no longer him 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.060
 activated absorbent filter 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.040

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.180
 wants microparticles cold can 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.930
 organic polluted 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.930
 these joke from the water 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.460
 osmotic about universal 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.150
 who took 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.099
 builds water on molecular 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.490
 no particles up to one 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:47.819
 ten thousandth bikram 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:51.290
 say goodbye to chemicals 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:53.840
 better toxin heavy metal 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.909
 mit allen biological substances there and 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.810
 hundreds of other pollutants 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:01.530
 which could be upset because 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.530
 drinking water 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.060
 but thanks today when myself 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.900
 before 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.579
 can techno 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.579
 water treatment everywhere 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.170
 third stage before purified 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.630
 like using 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.630
 passes through 2 more microfilter 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.730
 sit down cross and clean water at home 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.730
 houses 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.740
 for drinking 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.360
 clean water for your children 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.129
 fruits and vegetables 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.020
 cooking 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:50.020
 cooked food for babies 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.460
 stay at work with a sip of fresh water 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:04.139
 you are visiting your clients 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.139
 crystal clear water 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.560
 have a network of sources with crystal clear 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.560
 loved my water 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.260
 in all water filters the source of life
