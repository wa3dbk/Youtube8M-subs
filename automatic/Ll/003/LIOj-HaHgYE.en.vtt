00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.790
 Today's movie food comes from a 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.569
 classic saga of literature and cinema 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.429
 The Chronicles of Narnia 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.219
 the recipe I make is an acacia gum 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.259
 also known as manjar all when 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.360
 the white sorceress tries to bribe the 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.090
 world on anything he wants 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:24.750
 eat the baby he chooses this delicious 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:27.300
 of the trade by extending half a cup of 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.830
 water with 5 tablespoons of 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.260
 maize making an Arab is not difficult just 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.120
 I need to be careful with the times and 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.190
 quantities 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.660
 I let it heat up in a half small saucepan 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.059
 cup of water, that's where I'm going 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.059
 develop two cups of sugar 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:55.810
 and also Mexican orange juice 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.810
 Natural 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.280
 the dissolved sugar mixes a little 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.559
 more starch in cold water 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.230
 it always sediment a bit in the background and 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.150
 add pan and lower the heat go 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.570
 always stirring so that it does not stick to the 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.570
 bottom 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.020
 the mixture gradually thickens and 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.550
 getting gel texture time 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.640
 needed to stay in texture 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:27.380
 perfect is 15 minutes less than that 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.380
 and I stayed inside it does not ever seem 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.620
 When it is very thick, so disconnect 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.020
 the fire and I put two tablespoons of 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:49.110
 pomegranate syrup that gives color and 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.330
 taste for us now this is a flavors 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.150
 originals of the conab but also gives 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.070
 use orange or water flower water 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.420
 of roses just have to take good care of the 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.630
 do not get a taste for it 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.630
 like this 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.470
 The mixture in a mold is small and 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.470
 lined with film paper 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.969
 now you have to let it cool for no 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:30.680
 minimum of three hours minimum 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:33.290
 ideal is to leave from one day to the next 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.999
 for that one goes straight and without ever 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.999
 back in the fridge always outdoors 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.070
 spain goal on a board sprinkled with 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.380
 confectioner's sugar four squares and 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.550
 I'm back in sugar 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.550
 then just take the excess 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.489
 get all amazing is not for nothing that the 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:26.109
 the world asked the white sorceress 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.109
 one kiss is next 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.580

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.380
 food scenes leaving comments 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.950
