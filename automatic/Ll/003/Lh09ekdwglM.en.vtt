the hard floor without shooting it down
so<00:03:04.140> you<00:03:04.350> want<00:03:04.830> to<00:03:04.920> use<00:03:05.010> those<00:03:05.190> type<00:03:05.430> of

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
so you want to use those type of

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.980 
so you want to use those type of
killstreaks<00:03:05.970> I<00:03:06.090> don't<00:03:06.270> suggest<00:03:06.420> these<00:03:06.750> like

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
killstreaks I don't suggest these like

killstreaks I don't suggest these like
dogs<00:03:07.260> and<00:03:07.530> everything<00:03:07.590> because<00:03:08.280> you're<00:03:08.910> not

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
dogs and everything because you're not

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.000 
dogs and everything because you're not
gonna<00:03:09.180> get<00:03:09.390> as<00:03:09.570> many<00:03:09.840> kills<00:03:10.170> as<00:03:10.440> it's<00:03:10.680> worth

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
gonna get as many kills as it's worth

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.770 
gonna get as many kills as it's worth
because<00:03:11.520> there<00:03:11.640> are<00:03:11.790> only<00:03:11.820> like<00:03:12.120> four<00:03:12.600> guys

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
because there are only like four guys

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.440 
because there are only like four guys
maximum<00:03:13.440> on<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.710> other<00:03:13.860> team<00:03:14.130> so<00:03:15.030> that's

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
maximum on the other team so that's

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.060 
maximum on the other team so that's
basically<00:03:15.600> my<00:03:15.900> recommendation<00:03:16.800> for<00:03:16.950> that

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
basically my recommendation for that
