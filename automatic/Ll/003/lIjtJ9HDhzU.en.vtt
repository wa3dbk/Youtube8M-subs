sentence and topic sentences have a few

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.420 
sentence and topic sentences have a few
requirements<00:00:22.160> essentially<00:00:23.160> what<00:00:23.279> they<00:00:23.369> do

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.970 
thesis in that each of your topic
sentences<00:00:36.180> must<00:00:36.630> be<00:00:36.930> arguments<00:00:37.440> they<00:00:37.649> cannot

be<00:00:38.160> statements<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.700> fact<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.690> again<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:39.989> would

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
be statements of fact so again I would

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.959 
be statements of fact so again I would
ask<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.559> watch<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.070> video<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.370> made<00:00:41.520> on

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969
