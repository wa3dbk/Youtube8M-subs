alright guys welcome back this is my
life<00:00:07.250> of<00:00:07.340> Minecraft<00:00:07.729> and<00:00:08.029> I<00:00:08.240> just<00:00:08.480> while<00:00:09.200> I<00:00:09.230> was

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.320 
life of Minecraft and I just while I was

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.580 
life of Minecraft and I just while I was
making<00:00:09.500> my<00:00:09.679> other<00:00:10.000> door<00:00:11.000> tutorial<00:00:11.440> came<00:00:12.440> up

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.590 
making my other door tutorial came up

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.509 
making my other door tutorial came up
with<00:00:13.250> an<00:00:13.370> idea<00:00:13.430> on<00:00:14.090> how<00:00:14.120> to<00:00:14.269> make<00:00:14.660> a<00:00:15.519> another

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:16.519 
with an idea on how to make a another

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:19.120 
with an idea on how to make a another
set<00:00:16.849> of<00:00:17.090> automatic<00:00:17.689> double<00:00:17.869> doors<00:00:18.230> that<00:00:19.099> are

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
set of automatic double doors that are

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.730 
set of automatic double doors that are
rather<00:00:20.000> simple<00:00:20.480> and<00:00:20.720> I<00:00:21.020> think<00:00:21.199> easy<00:00:21.380> to<00:00:21.530> make

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
rather simple and I think easy to make

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.519 
rather simple and I think easy to make
so<00:00:22.400> I'm<00:00:22.550> going<00:00:22.610> to<00:00:22.960> go<00:00:23.960> ahead<00:00:23.990> and<00:00:24.199> show<00:00:24.500> you

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
so I'm going to go ahead and show you

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
here in this video so this is going to

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.930 
here in this video so this is going to
be<00:00:26.630> a<00:00:26.660> tutorial<00:00:26.960> on<00:00:27.199> how<00:00:27.260> to<00:00:27.380> make<00:00:27.940> automatic

be a tutorial on how to make automatic
double<00:00:29.270> doors<00:00:30.279> and<00:00:31.279> you<00:00:31.939> know<00:00:32.029> pretty<00:00:32.210> much

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
double doors and you know pretty much

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:33.910 
double doors and you know pretty much
anytime<00:00:32.870> you<00:00:32.989> can<00:00:33.079> have<00:00:33.230> doors<00:00:33.469> you're<00:00:33.800> going

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
anytime you can have doors you're going

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.889 
anytime you can have doors you're going
to<00:00:33.980> have<00:00:34.070> either<00:00:34.399> one<00:00:34.730> or<00:00:34.789> two<00:00:35.120> and<00:00:35.359> they're

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
to have either one or two and they're

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:38.889 
to have either one or two and they're
going<00:00:35.989> to<00:00:36.050> be<00:00:36.200> you<00:00:36.530> know<00:00:36.620> surrounded<00:00:37.160> by<00:00:37.899> some

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
going to be you know surrounded by some

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:40.479 
going to be you know surrounded by some
sort<00:00:39.050> of<00:00:39.140> wall<00:00:39.410> which<00:00:39.829> is<00:00:39.980> which<00:00:40.250> is<00:00:40.370> what

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
sort of wall which is which is what

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.979 
sort of wall which is which is what
allows<00:00:40.730> us<00:00:41.000> to<00:00:41.180> work<00:00:41.390> so<00:00:43.719> we're<00:00:44.719> going<00:00:44.840> to<00:00:44.899> need

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
allows us to work so we're going to need

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.440 
allows us to work so we're going to need
pressure<00:00:45.260> plates<00:00:45.559> for<00:00:46.489> pressure<00:00:46.760> plates<00:00:47.090> two

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
pressure plates for pressure plates two

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.560 
pressure plates for pressure plates two
double<00:00:47.750> doors<00:00:47.899> some<00:00:48.770> red<00:00:49.329> redstone<00:00:50.329> wiring

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
double doors some red redstone wiring

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.569 
double doors some red redstone wiring
and<00:00:50.870> a<00:00:50.989> couple<00:00:51.200> torches<00:00:51.710> now<00:00:52.219> I<00:00:52.250> talked<00:00:52.489> about

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
and a couple torches now I talked about

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.700 
and a couple torches now I talked about
this<00:00:52.790> in<00:00:52.850> my<00:00:53.030> last<00:00:53.210> double<00:00:53.719> doors<00:00:53.899> video<00:00:54.290> but

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
this in my last double doors video but

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.790 
this in my last double doors video but
if<00:00:55.129> you<00:00:55.340> place<00:00:55.579> a<00:00:56.379> pressure<00:00:57.379> plate<00:00:57.590> right

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
if you place a pressure plate right

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.850 
if you place a pressure plate right
there<00:00:57.850> you<00:00:58.850> can<00:00:59.059> you<00:00:59.809> know<00:00:59.930> affect<00:01:00.260> your<00:01:00.410> doors

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.229 

then<00:01:03.860> I<00:01:03.980> know<00:01:04.189> it's<00:01:04.339> going<00:01:04.430> to<00:01:04.489> be<00:01:04.640> open<00:01:05.030> and

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
then I know it's going to be open and

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.739 
then I know it's going to be open and
they<00:01:06.200> don't<00:01:06.380> open<00:01:06.710> simultaneously<00:01:06.890> so<00:01:07.749> we're

00:01:08.739 --> 00:01:08.749 
they don't open simultaneously so we're

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:13.539 
they don't open simultaneously so we're
going<00:01:08.899> to<00:01:10.299> bypass<00:01:11.299> that<00:01:11.359> by<00:01:12.229> taking<00:01:12.490> two<00:01:13.490> steps

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
going to bypass that by taking two steps

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.059 
going to bypass that by taking two steps
back<00:01:14.029> so<00:01:14.899> there's<00:01:15.079> a<00:01:15.139> gap<00:01:15.409> between<00:01:15.829> the

00:01:16.059 --> 00:01:16.069 
back so there's a gap between the

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:17.919 
back so there's a gap between the
pressure<00:01:16.279> plate<00:01:16.459> and<00:01:16.670> the<00:01:16.729> door<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:17.779> we're

00:01:17.919 --> 00:01:17.929 
pressure plate and the door and we're

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:20.679 
pressure plate and the door and we're
going<00:01:18.049> to<00:01:18.079> run<00:01:18.229> red<00:01:18.889> stone<00:01:19.189> underneath<00:01:19.789> I'm

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
going to run red stone underneath I'm

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.160 
going to run red stone underneath I'm
going<00:01:20.840> to<00:01:20.899> do<00:01:20.959> this<00:01:21.020> on<00:01:21.170> both<00:01:21.200> sides<00:01:21.529> so<00:01:21.799> one

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
going to do this on both sides so one

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.949 
going to do this on both sides so one
pressure<00:01:24.170> plates<00:01:25.539> so<00:01:26.539> now<00:01:26.630> we're<00:01:26.779> just<00:01:26.810> going

00:01:26.949 --> 00:01:26.959 
pressure plates so now we're just going

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:29.649 
pressure plates so now we're just going
to<00:01:27.079> dig<00:01:27.259> down<00:01:27.409> and<00:01:27.649> I<00:01:28.520> kind<00:01:28.729> of<00:01:28.789> explain<00:01:29.149> what

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
to dig down and I kind of explain what

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.739 
to dig down and I kind of explain what
I'm<00:01:29.749> doing<00:01:30.109> this<00:01:30.229> I'm<00:01:30.380> doing<00:01:30.499> it<00:01:31.509> I'm<00:01:32.509> going<00:01:32.659> to

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:32.749 
I'm doing this I'm doing it I'm going to

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:34.480 
I'm doing this I'm doing it I'm going to
anything<00:01:33.319> that's<00:01:33.529> important<00:01:34.130> I'm<00:01:34.279> going<00:01:34.399> to

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
anything that's important I'm going to

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.219 
anything that's important I'm going to
replace<00:01:34.700> its<00:01:34.880> cobblestone<00:01:35.299> well<00:01:36.109> not

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
replace its cobblestone well not

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.260 
replace its cobblestone well not
everything<00:01:36.649> so<00:01:37.399> I<00:01:37.429> otherwise<00:01:38.060> this<00:01:38.209> whole

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
everything so I otherwise this whole

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.779 
everything so I otherwise this whole
hole<00:01:38.659> would<00:01:38.899> be<00:01:39.009> cobblestone<00:01:40.009> but<00:01:40.279> these<00:01:40.549> two

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
hole would be cobblestone but these two

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:42.639 
hole would be cobblestone but these two
particular<00:01:40.969> blocks<00:01:41.539> are<00:01:41.719> important<00:01:42.139> because

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
particular blocks are important because

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.959 
particular blocks are important because
they<00:01:42.799> are<00:01:44.169> right<00:01:45.169> underneath<00:01:45.729> you<00:01:46.729> know<00:01:46.849> the

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
they are right underneath you know the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.269 
they are right underneath you know the
pressure<00:01:47.179> plates<00:01:47.799> and<00:01:48.799> we're<00:01:48.950> going<00:01:49.099> to<00:01:49.159> take

00:01:49.269 --> 00:01:49.279 
pressure plates and we're going to take

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:51.399 
pressure plates and we're going to take
redstone<00:01:49.880> and<00:01:50.060> place<00:01:50.569> them<00:01:50.719> right<00:01:50.749> there<00:01:51.049> so

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
redstone and place them right there so

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.260 
redstone and place them right there so
when<00:01:51.529> you<00:01:51.590> push<00:01:51.770> those<00:01:51.950> buttons<00:01:52.099> that'll<00:01:53.060> turn

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
when you push those buttons that'll turn

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.609 
when you push those buttons that'll turn
this<00:01:53.869> on<00:01:54.139> and<00:01:55.359> then<00:01:56.359> we<00:01:56.539> need<00:01:56.689> to<00:01:56.989> work<00:01:57.409> our<00:01:57.590> way

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
this on and then we need to work our way

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.959 
this on and then we need to work our way
over<00:01:58.099> here<00:02:00.159> because<00:02:01.159> how<00:02:01.520> this<00:02:01.669> is<00:02:01.759> going<00:02:01.880> to

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
over here because how this is going to

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
over here because how this is going to
work<00:02:02.059> is<00:02:02.209> going<00:02:02.419> to<00:02:02.479> round<00:02:02.630> that<00:02:02.719> wiring

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:02.989 
work is going to round that wiring

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:05.589 
work is going to round that wiring
underneath<00:02:03.859> this<00:02:04.099> wall<00:02:04.399> and<00:02:04.639> to<00:02:05.179> the<00:02:05.299> block

00:02:05.589 --> 00:02:05.599 
underneath this wall and to the block

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:07.599 
underneath this wall and to the block
that<00:02:05.929> that<00:02:06.109> door<00:02:06.469> sitting<00:02:06.889> on<00:02:07.039> which<00:02:07.429> will

there<00:02:17.360> let's<00:02:18.360> just<00:02:18.420> have<00:02:18.780> one<00:02:19.050> block<00:02:19.319> up

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
there let's just have one block up

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.490 
there let's just have one block up
against<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:20.069> I<00:02:20.220> think<00:02:20.370> that'll<00:02:20.610> work<00:02:20.640> best<00:02:21.000> and

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
against it I think that'll work best and

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.580 
against it I think that'll work best and
then<00:02:23.360> this<00:02:24.360> direction<00:02:24.660> until<00:02:25.230> we<00:02:25.319> hit<00:02:25.440> this

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
then this direction until we hit this

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.949 
then this direction until we hit this
whole<00:02:25.800> perfect<00:02:29.000> as<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.209> can<00:02:30.299> see<00:02:30.480> that<00:02:30.750> door

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
whole perfect as you can see that door

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.050 
whole perfect as you can see that door
is<00:02:31.049> open<00:02:31.440> so<00:02:32.160> we<00:02:32.340> are<00:02:32.430> going<00:02:32.549> to<00:02:32.670> need<00:02:32.760> that

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
is open so we are going to need that

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.360 
is open so we are going to need that
power<00:02:33.269> to<00:02:34.140> be<00:02:34.260> switched<00:02:34.650> so<00:02:35.069> we're<00:02:35.190> going<00:02:35.280> to

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
power to be switched so we're going to

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.610 
power to be switched so we're going to
turn<00:02:35.549> this<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:36.080> cobblestone<00:02:37.080> block<00:02:37.379> right<00:02:37.590> here

so<00:02:52.079> please<00:02:52.410> check<00:02:52.440> those<00:02:52.769> out<00:02:52.890> so<00:02:53.220> now<00:02:53.760> when<00:02:53.880> i

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
so please check those out so now when i

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.770 
so please check those out so now when i
push<00:02:54.120> these<00:02:54.269> buttons<00:02:54.329> should<00:02:54.780> open<00:02:55.170> side<00:02:55.379> door

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
push these buttons should open side door

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.970 
push these buttons should open side door
so<00:02:57.780> now<00:02:57.840> we're<00:02:57.930> going<00:02:58.019> to<00:02:58.079> dig<00:02:58.290> down<00:02:58.440> i'm<00:02:58.829> going

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
so now we're going to dig down i'm going

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.860 
so now we're going to dig down i'm going
to<00:02:59.040> power<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.819> other<00:02:59.879> door<00:03:00.150> now<00:03:00.480> this<00:03:00.629> side<00:03:00.750> is

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
to power the other door now this side is

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.740 
to power the other door now this side is
even<00:03:01.049> simpler<00:03:01.349> because<00:03:02.209> this<00:03:03.209> door<00:03:03.450> already

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
even simpler because this door already

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.809 
even simpler because this door already
has<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.170> power<00:03:04.349> we<00:03:04.530> want<00:03:04.709> it<00:03:04.799> to<00:03:04.829> all<00:03:05.430> we<00:03:05.670> have

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
has the power we want it to all we have

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:11.979 
has the power we want it to all we have
to<00:03:05.849> do<00:03:06.060> is<00:03:06.209> run<00:03:06.390> this<00:03:07.400> redstone<00:03:08.400> to<00:03:08.819> it<00:03:09.019> so<00:03:10.019> it's

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
to do is run this redstone to it so it's

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.140 
to do is run this redstone to it so it's
more<00:03:12.989> under<00:03:13.379> the<00:03:13.500> wall<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:14.280> that's<00:03:14.819> the<00:03:15.000> block

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
more under the wall and that's the block

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.420 
more under the wall and that's the block
we<00:03:15.299> need<00:03:15.450> to<00:03:15.510> get<00:03:15.630> to<00:03:16.040> so<00:03:17.040> we<00:03:17.160> were<00:03:17.280> on<00:03:17.340> the

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
we need to get to so we were on the

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.870 
we need to get to so we were on the
Redstone<00:03:17.760> up<00:03:17.880> to<00:03:18.030> it<00:03:18.150> and<00:03:18.269> over<00:03:19.109> to<00:03:19.139> our

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
Redstone up to it and over to our

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.849 
Redstone up to it and over to our
pressure<00:03:20.880> plates<00:03:21.230> as<00:03:22.230> you<00:03:22.380> can<00:03:22.470> see<00:03:22.709> already

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
pressure plates as you can see already

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:27.080 
pressure plates as you can see already
this<00:03:23.489> is<00:03:23.639> a<00:03:23.819> I<00:03:24.980> feel<00:03:25.980> a<00:03:26.010> slightly<00:03:26.370> simpler<00:03:26.819> or

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
this is a I feel a slightly simpler or

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.800 
this is a I feel a slightly simpler or
more<00:03:27.150> compact<00:03:28.049> version<00:03:28.950> of<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.819> double<00:03:30.630> doors

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
more compact version of the double doors

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.379 
more compact version of the double doors
that<00:03:30.989> I<00:03:31.019> had<00:03:31.170> before<00:03:31.519> but<00:03:32.519> anyways<00:03:32.790> so<00:03:33.269> now

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
that I had before but anyways so now

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:34.370 
that I had before but anyways so now
I've<00:03:33.480> got<00:03:33.599> the<00:03:33.690> register<00:03:33.989> and<00:03:34.049> running<00:03:34.290> to

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
I've got the register and running to

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.930 
I've got the register and running to
that<00:03:34.500> door<00:03:34.739> and<00:03:35.010> I've<00:03:35.099> got<00:03:35.130> redstone<00:03:35.639> running

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
that door and I've got redstone running

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.729 
that door and I've got redstone running
to<00:03:36.389> this<00:03:36.510> door<00:03:36.750> so<00:03:36.900> when<00:03:36.989> I<00:03:37.049> push<00:03:37.260> these<00:03:37.380> plates

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
to this door so when I push these plates

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.520 
to this door so when I push these plates
both<00:03:38.370> those<00:03:38.549> doors<00:03:38.819> should<00:03:39.000> open<00:03:39.530> beautiful

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
both those doors should open beautiful

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.370 
both those doors should open beautiful
exactly<00:03:41.130> what<00:03:41.250> I<00:03:41.280> want<00:03:41.459> to<00:03:41.519> go<00:03:42.019> so<00:03:43.019> now<00:03:43.109> we<00:03:43.169> need

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
exactly what I want to go so now we need

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.009 
exactly what I want to go so now we need
to<00:03:43.440> take<00:03:43.620> these<00:03:43.889> the<00:03:44.639> doors<00:03:44.849> now<00:03:45.630> since<00:03:45.810> we've

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
to take these the doors now since we've

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.659 
to take these the doors now since we've
already<00:03:46.139> got<00:03:46.319> a<00:03:46.349> circuit<00:03:46.799> that<00:03:46.980> runs<00:03:47.489> the

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
already got a circuit that runs the

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.930 
already got a circuit that runs the
doors<00:03:47.849> all<00:03:48.359> we're<00:03:48.750> going<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:48.930> have<00:03:49.049> to<00:03:49.200> do<00:03:49.349> is

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
doors all we're going to have to do is

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.849 
doors all we're going to have to do is
run<00:03:50.940> red<00:03:51.599> stone<00:03:51.870> from<00:03:52.109> these<00:03:52.260> pressure<00:03:52.530> plates

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
run red stone from these pressure plates

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.550 
run red stone from these pressure plates
over<00:03:53.849> to<00:03:53.940> here<00:03:54.239> and<00:03:54.510> connect<00:03:54.810> to<00:03:54.959> that<00:03:55.200> spot

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
over to here and connect to that spot

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:04.540 
over to here and connect to that spot
right<00:03:55.680> there<00:03:55.769> and<00:03:56.329> I'll<00:03:57.329> explain

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.119 

so<00:04:05.550> these<00:04:05.870> spots<00:04:06.870> of<00:04:07.110> course<00:04:07.379> our<00:04:07.830> call<00:04:08.040> the

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
so these spots of course our call the

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:09.410 
so these spots of course our call the
stone<00:04:08.370> because<00:04:08.879> they're<00:04:09.060> directly

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
stone because they're directly

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.449 
stone because they're directly
underneath<00:04:09.720> those<00:04:10.140> pressure<00:04:10.530> plates<00:04:10.830> they

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
underneath those pressure plates they

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:12.860 
underneath those pressure plates they
don't<00:04:11.610> have<00:04:11.730> to<00:04:11.879> be<00:04:11.910> cops<00:04:12.180> down<00:04:12.420> I'm<00:04:12.660> just

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
don't have to be cops down I'm just

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:19.849 
don't have to be cops down I'm just
doing<00:04:13.080> it<00:04:13.200> so<00:04:13.230> you<00:04:13.410> guys<00:04:13.709> know<00:04:14.700> oh<00:04:18.859> yeah

doing it so you guys know oh yeah
perfect<00:04:20.370> let's<00:04:20.810> fill<00:04:21.810> this<00:04:21.930> in<00:04:23.870> and<00:04:24.870> then<00:04:25.020> boom

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 
perfect let's fill this in and then boom

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:27.110 
perfect let's fill this in and then boom
that<00:04:25.740> should<00:04:25.979> be<00:04:26.130> all<00:04:26.160> we<00:04:26.370> need<00:04:26.400> to<00:04:26.550> do<00:04:26.729> but

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
that should be all we need to do but

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.490 
that should be all we need to do but
that<00:04:27.300> should<00:04:27.570> be<00:04:27.690> all<00:04:27.720> we<00:04:28.020> need<00:04:28.199> for<00:04:28.410> this

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
that should be all we need for this

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.550 
that should be all we need for this
circuit<00:04:28.910> this<00:04:29.910> is<00:04:30.060> a<00:04:30.270> very<00:04:30.540> shallow<00:04:30.990> circuit

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
circuit this is a very shallow circuit

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.409 
circuit this is a very shallow circuit
so<00:04:31.919> you<00:04:31.979> can<00:04:32.220> if<00:04:32.490> you<00:04:32.610> you're<00:04:33.060> tight<00:04:33.240> on<00:04:33.270> space

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
so you can if you you're tight on space

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.010 
so you can if you you're tight on space
you<00:04:34.110> know<00:04:34.229> this<00:04:34.470> works<00:04:34.850> also<00:04:35.850> it<00:04:36.660> can<00:04:36.780> all<00:04:36.990> be

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
you know this works also it can all be

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.750 
you know this works also it can all be
buried<00:04:37.560> so<00:04:37.889> you<00:04:37.979> won't<00:04:38.070> see<00:04:38.220> any<00:04:38.490> of<00:04:38.639> the

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
buried so you won't see any of the

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.640 
buried so you won't see any of the
redstone<00:04:39.150> let<00:04:39.930> me<00:04:40.020> explain<00:04:40.080> why<00:04:40.440> you<00:04:40.500> only

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
redstone let me explain why you only

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.240 
redstone let me explain why you only
need<00:04:40.919> this<00:04:41.850> one<00:04:42.150> wire<00:04:42.360> going<00:04:42.690> over<00:04:42.990> here<00:04:43.260> when

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
need this one wire going over here when

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.710 
need this one wire going over here when
you<00:04:44.340> press<00:04:44.520> these<00:04:44.669> plates<00:04:44.970> it'll<00:04:45.389> turn<00:04:45.540> the

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
you press these plates it'll turn the

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.260 
you press these plates it'll turn the
power<00:04:45.900> on<00:04:46.080> here<00:04:46.410> running<00:04:46.919> it<00:04:47.040> up<00:04:47.190> which<00:04:48.150> will

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
power on here running it up which will

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.990 
power on here running it up which will
activate<00:04:48.690> this<00:04:48.960> door<00:04:49.200> which<00:04:49.979> is<00:04:50.130> exactly<00:04:50.340> what

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
activate this door which is exactly what

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.029 
activate this door which is exactly what
we<00:04:51.120> need<00:04:51.270> then<00:04:51.900> I'll<00:04:52.050> continue<00:04:52.440> going<00:04:52.740> and

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
we need then I'll continue going and

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:54.980 
we need then I'll continue going and
i'll<00:04:53.580> hit<00:04:53.760> that<00:04:53.910> inverter<00:04:54.300> which<00:04:54.810> will

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
i'll hit that inverter which will

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.529 
i'll hit that inverter which will
continue<00:04:55.350> through<00:04:55.560> and<00:04:55.800> hit<00:04:56.250> that<00:04:56.430> door<00:04:56.610> so

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
continue through and hit that door so

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:59.750 
continue through and hit that door so
let's<00:04:58.139> test<00:04:58.380> it<00:04:58.590> and<00:04:58.740> it's<00:04:59.340> turning<00:04:59.520> night
