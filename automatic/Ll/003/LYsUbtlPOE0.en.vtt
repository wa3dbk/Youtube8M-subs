and I think I'll lift this weight it
only<00:02:58.580> takes<00:02:58.820> a<00:02:58.940> set<00:02:59.180> to<00:02:59.390> gauge<00:02:59.600> exactly<00:02:59.630> how

only takes a set to gauge exactly how
much<00:03:00.590> weight<00:03:00.800> they<00:03:00.980> should<00:03:01.160> lift<00:03:01.310> and<00:03:01.520> if<00:03:01.910> they

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
much weight they should lift and if they
