00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.089
 Markus Kasper would like to know 

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:12.949
 there was the late 3 to 4 against Arminia Hannover in the Regionalliga yours 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:15.949
 Worst area or spontaneously 1 1 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:18.070
 I discuss lectures from 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.330
 dapd No, of course I know it 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.610
 yes, of course that was a tough opponent it was I miss him 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.660
 sometimes as a mistake especially a very curious gate was you seen that 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.140
 but there is almost a corner flag of Expand Roll Nicolas Schmit the ball of 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.390
 Since he can go into the gate, he is still a mystery if you nachstellte 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.300
 Buntentor try not to succeed 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.990
 But that was already very curious goal, of course, very bitter if you do that 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.990
 Eagle as in the mine LandschÃ¼tz because thereby loses 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.300
 In the early evening long career you get to Mars lying down in front of something 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.520
 was avoidable to me personally can change me to a for example in 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.030
 Jena where I really let the ball slip through his legs too 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.040
 a very important game 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.940
 but this I felt worse than a lot of style as a seat of them here 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.840
 but now to our second Facebook 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.170
 Dr. Alexander KEP Kielce wants to know that ron-robert Zieler is better 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.700
 as you add to it earlier 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.490
 nobody is better than sex Ebert 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.830
 Grand Prix chased Offenburg BZ 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:24.930
 has 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.890
 Well, I think that someone good new goalkeeper and Co not so long 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.210
 can play 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.600
 but in comparison, the passage is that it is extremely difficult to believe that he 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.570
 at the Robert Zieler Quaderer Stross vom appears to be stronger than 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:39.270
 I 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.390
 that I guess that was not necessarily my strength 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.540
 I was awarded by myself I was in the one-on-one that was all 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.430
 wonderful 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.030
 but Grabner penalty area domination I certainly have not too many balls around 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.410
 and he brings 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.540
 like October does but I also had someone like for example 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.870
 Reverse the episode more 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.080
 So so and more air made everything fit but I could then access me 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:11.799
