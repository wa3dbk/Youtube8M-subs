00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:07.830
 this is the census booklet and it will be 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.160
 A little soft because I get down a little 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:18.449
 out of the refrigerator okay but I will inter 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:21.539
 room like that oh I was point for you 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:25.529
 see yourself on leave and after 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.820
 late late purpose of this profile 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.019
 ideal is not from outside, I 'm not 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:37.620
 especially at this ball 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:43.200
 Corinthians and saints can have the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:45.539
 colors that in this super cool and me 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:52.920
 I also put this effect 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:56.510
 gradient for you see you stayed 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:00.510
 really black, it 's easy to just hit the 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:04.019
 density of chile that they will leave 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.220
 outside he is in the middle but he does not 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.420
 There is a problem 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.950
 also show the same how it was 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.500
 cool 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:19.290
 the tone of cutting and it's no use to us 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:22.260
 do without showing 100 of color as I said 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.520
 in front of the insect you 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:30.900
 use whipped cream and chocolate to 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:35.630
 tonality of the color you saw 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.630
 earlier in the other video then 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:51.810
 the valencia showed the effect on top of the 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.799
 cake is super cool because before 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:59.700
 know also the theme of cars 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:05.340
 Also this subject is black and 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:08.789
 white is also accurate neither file in 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:22.410
 Black and white is also not levied 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:27.330
 easier to show the earlier 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:29.880
 corinthians and saints made do 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:37.340
 quoted from Halloween showed how 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:41.340
 the banks showed retreat in the ana eu 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:46.440
 it was that you liked 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:51.510
 You always have to book an afternoon. 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:55.470
 to finalize the videos teach better 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.239
 for you guys than staying at all hours there 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.840
 in the comments that I think is a 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:07.440
 little harder to teach 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:09.870
 Okay, so stay there again, too. 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:14.190
 I tried the black will not stay 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:16.109
 bittering your chance and it's chocolate 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.319
 so I actually had the voice of the 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:20.940
 palace and I hope you have 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:24.450
 liked my loves 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.770
 Any questions are there to help 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.930
 just ask 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.930
 It's a good destination right.
