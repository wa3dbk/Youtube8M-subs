00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
how to use our new invention called wave

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.190 
how to use our new invention called wave
clip<00:00:10.769> now<00:00:11.700> wave<00:00:12.030> clip<00:00:12.300> is<00:00:12.450> quite<00:00:12.780> an<00:00:12.929> ingenious

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
clip now wave clip is quite an ingenious

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.410 
clip now wave clip is quite an ingenious
invention<00:00:14.009> in<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.490> way<00:00:14.700> that<00:00:14.910> what<00:00:15.089> it<00:00:15.210> does

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
invention in the way that what it does

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.599 
invention in the way that what it does
it<00:00:15.630> gives<00:00:15.780> your<00:00:15.929> hair<00:00:16.139> just<00:00:16.350> that<00:00:16.560> very<00:00:16.830> subtle

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
it gives your hair just that very subtle

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.150 
it gives your hair just that very subtle
slight<00:00:18.270> movement<00:00:18.960> so<00:00:19.140> I'm<00:00:19.590> sure<00:00:19.859> that<00:00:20.039> you've

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
slight movement so I'm sure that you've

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.609 
slight movement so I'm sure that you've
had<00:00:20.279> clients<00:00:20.490> asking<00:00:21.000> you<00:00:21.119> for<00:00:21.449> just<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.170> bit<00:00:22.439> of

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
had clients asking you for just a bit of

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.650 
had clients asking you for just a bit of
movement<00:00:23.070> so<00:00:23.250> what<00:00:23.699> you<00:00:23.789> do<00:00:23.910> is<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.180> blow-dry

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
movement so what you do is you blow-dry

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.689 
movement so what you do is you blow-dry
the<00:00:24.750> hair<00:00:24.869> smooth<00:00:25.350> then<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.160> apply<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.400> wave

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
the hair smooth then you apply the wave

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.609 
the hair smooth then you apply the wave
clip<00:00:27.060> after<00:00:27.269> just<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.869> give<00:00:28.050> your<00:00:28.170> straight

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
clip after just to give your straight

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
blow-dryer just that little tiny subtle

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.860 
blow-dryer just that little tiny subtle
little<00:00:31.890> wave<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:33.300> actually<00:00:33.600> makes<00:00:33.750> the

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
little wave so it actually makes the

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.690 
little wave so it actually makes the
hair<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.079> bit<00:00:34.230> sort<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.500> 70s<00:00:34.860> looking<00:00:35.489> but

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
hair a bit sort of 70s looking but

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.520 
hair a bit sort of 70s looking but
without<00:00:35.969> looking<00:00:36.450> like<00:00:36.480> well<00:00:37.230> without<00:00:37.380> having

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
without looking like well without having

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.889 
without looking like well without having
to<00:00:37.739> go<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.950> trouble<00:00:38.250> using<00:00:38.610> hot<00:00:38.940> irons<00:00:39.390> tongs

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
to go the trouble using hot irons tongs

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.600 
to go the trouble using hot irons tongs
so<00:00:40.170> it's<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.379> really<00:00:40.530> simple<00:00:40.829> product<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.460> you

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
so it's a really simple product to you

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.709 
so it's a really simple product to you
so<00:00:41.910> simply<00:00:42.780> all<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.320> really<00:00:43.469> have<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.829> do<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.719> I

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
so simply all you really have to do is I

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.420 
so simply all you really have to do is I
would<00:00:45.989> apply<00:00:46.350> like<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.620> holding<00:00:47.039> product<00:00:47.309> like

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
would apply like a holding product like

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.819 
would apply like a holding product like
say<00:00:47.610> anti<00:00:47.969> gravity<00:00:48.149> or<00:00:48.480> bodybuilder<00:00:49.140> I'd<00:00:49.469> put

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
say anti gravity or bodybuilder I'd put

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.410 
say anti gravity or bodybuilder I'd put
it<00:00:49.920> into<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.250> hair<00:00:50.430> first<00:00:50.700> dry<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.120> hair

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
it into the hair first dry the hair

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.299 
it into the hair first dry the hair
smooth<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.140> then<00:00:52.590> pretty<00:00:52.770> much<00:00:52.860> take<00:00:53.280> a

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309

smooth and then pretty much take a
section<00:00:53.879> all<00:00:54.420> at<00:00:54.690> once<00:00:54.899> we're<00:00:55.020> just<00:00:55.170> gonna

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
section all at once we're just gonna

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260 
section all at once we're just gonna
spin<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.800> around<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:56.129> bit<00:00:56.160> here<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:57.180> take

spin you around a bit here so you take

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.130 
spin you around a bit here so you take
quite<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.690> large<00:00:58.020> section<00:00:59.840> now<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.930> want<00:01:01.079> to

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
quite a large section now you want to

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.750 
quite a large section now you want to
drop<00:01:01.350> this<00:01:01.500> down<00:01:01.559> sort<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.129> quite<00:01:02.430> load

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
so here I love leaving the front out

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.190 
so here I love leaving the front out
because<00:01:15.390> we've<00:01:15.540> got<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.689> bit<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:15.990> short

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
because we've got a bit of a short

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.230 
because we've got a bit of a short
fringe<00:01:16.530> what<00:01:17.250> I'm<00:01:17.400> going<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.700> do<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.909> take<00:01:18.210> that

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
fringe what I'm going to do is take that

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.899 
fringe what I'm going to do is take that
whole<00:01:18.810> side<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:19.650> it's<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.890> slight<00:01:20.159> sort<00:01:20.820> of

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
whole side so it's a slight sort of

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.730 
whole side so it's a slight sort of
triangle<00:01:21.390> section<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.470> want<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.650> go

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
triangle section so you want to go

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.789 
triangle section so you want to go
straight<00:01:23.009> in<00:01:23.280> like<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.500> then<00:01:25.500> just<00:01:25.650> make

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
straight in like so and then just make

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.230 
straight in like so and then just make
sure<00:01:25.979> there<00:01:26.159> are<00:01:26.250> no<00:01:26.460> hair<00:01:26.759> caught<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.060> the

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
sure there are no hair caught in the

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.170 
sure there are no hair caught in the
ridges<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.720> all<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.290> do<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.439> just<00:01:28.740> click

ridges and all you do is just click

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.319 
ridges and all you do is just click
you're<00:01:30.180> done<00:01:30.390> then<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.110> take<00:01:31.320> your<00:01:31.350> next<00:01:32.329> wave

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
you're done then you take your next wave

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.170 
you're done then you take your next wave
clip<00:01:34.220> then<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.310> want<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.520> bring<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.820> all<00:01:36.030> the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
clip then you want to bring that all the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.760 
clip then you want to bring that all the
way<00:01:36.299> down<00:01:36.329> they<00:01:36.689> see<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.049> wave<00:01:37.229> Clips<00:01:37.560> all

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
way down they see the wave Clips all

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.660 
way down they see the wave Clips all
meet<00:01:38.130> up<00:01:38.240> to<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.360> end<00:01:39.540> here<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.400> all<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.549> way

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
meet up to the end here so all the way

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.179 
meet up to the end here so all the way
down<00:01:41.939> like<00:01:42.329> so<00:01:43.229> make<00:01:43.560> sure<00:01:43.710> there's<00:01:43.890> no<00:01:44.009> hair
