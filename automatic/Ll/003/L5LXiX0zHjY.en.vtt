00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:58.369 
which comes in four great shades I'm
using<00:00:56.069> the<00:00:56.249> bright<00:00:56.519> amethyst<00:00:57.239> pencil<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:57.989> I

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
using the bright amethyst pencil and I

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.169 
using the bright amethyst pencil and I
find<00:00:58.710> with<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.069> pencil<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.699> need<00:00:59.909> to<00:01:00.030> use

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:00.179 
find with this pencil you need to use

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:02.360 
find with this pencil you need to use
lots<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.690> small<00:01:01.109> strokes<00:01:01.589> to<00:01:01.829> build<00:01:02.039> up<00:01:02.249> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
lots of small strokes to build up the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:11.289 
lots of small strokes to build up the
color<00:01:02.839> so<00:01:03.839> just<00:01:04.080> keep<00:01:04.260> working<00:01:04.800> at<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.040> roots

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.330 

and<00:01:11.899> I<00:01:11.960> think<00:01:12.140> a<00:01:12.200> good<00:01:12.469> tip<00:01:12.710> is<00:01:12.829> to<00:01:13.009> use<00:01:13.189> the

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
and I think a good tip is to use the

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.859 
and I think a good tip is to use the
pencil<00:01:13.700> on<00:01:13.729> the<00:01:13.850> back<00:01:14.030> of<00:01:14.179> your<00:01:14.299> hand<00:01:14.539> first

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
pencil on the back of your hand first

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.200 
pencil on the back of your hand first
just<00:01:15.289> to<00:01:15.439> warm<00:01:15.679> up<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:16.039> color<00:01:16.280> and<00:01:16.549> help<00:01:17.060> the

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
just to warm up the color and help the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.359 
just to warm up the color and help the
color<00:01:17.420> payoff<00:01:17.719> and<00:01:18.229> then<00:01:18.710> just<00:01:18.920> keep<00:01:19.100> building

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
color payoff and then just keep building

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.190 
color payoff and then just keep building
up<00:01:19.640> small<00:01:20.030> strokes<00:01:20.390> until<00:01:20.630> you<00:01:20.869> get<00:01:21.079> the

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
up small strokes until you get the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.039 
up small strokes until you get the
intensity<00:01:21.829> that<00:01:21.950> you<00:01:22.009> like<00:01:22.340> and<00:01:22.820> I<00:01:23.479> think<00:01:23.780> this

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
intensity that you like and I think this

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.679 
intensity that you like and I think this
way<00:01:24.289> of<00:01:24.469> wearing<00:01:24.829> a<00:01:24.890> very<00:01:25.219> bright<00:01:25.670> color<00:01:26.030> just

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
way of wearing a very bright color just

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.169 
way of wearing a very bright color just
as<00:01:26.929> a<00:01:26.960> flash<00:01:27.350> at<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:27.950> roots<00:01:28.189> of<00:01:28.369> the<00:01:28.490> lashes<00:01:28.520> I

00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:29.179 
as a flash at the roots of the lashes I

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:31.240 
as a flash at the roots of the lashes I
feel<00:01:29.960> very<00:01:30.079> comfortable<00:01:30.380> with<00:01:30.709> it<00:01:30.950> and<00:01:31.159> I

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
feel very comfortable with it and I

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.980 
feel very comfortable with it and I
think<00:01:31.310> it<00:01:31.520> looks<00:01:31.700> really<00:01:31.850> nice<00:01:32.450> but<00:01:32.810> it's<00:01:32.929> not

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
think it looks really nice but it's not

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.980 
think it looks really nice but it's not
overpowering<00:01:33.819> so<00:01:34.819> it's<00:01:35.000> a<00:01:35.090> kind<00:01:35.270> of<00:01:35.329> easy<00:01:35.689> way

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
overpowering so it's a kind of easy way

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.109 
overpowering so it's a kind of easy way
to<00:01:36.049> wear<00:01:36.350> color<00:01:36.409> for<00:01:37.009> my<00:01:37.130> lashes<00:01:37.340> I'm<00:01:37.759> going<00:01:37.969> to

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
to wear color for my lashes I'm going to

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.209 
to wear color for my lashes I'm going to
use<00:01:38.270> one<00:01:38.450> of<00:01:38.539> the<00:01:38.659> new<00:01:38.990> colored<00:01:39.590> grandiose

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:40.219 
use one of the new colored grandiose

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:43.109 
use one of the new colored grandiose
mascaras<00:01:41.060> which<00:01:41.600> come<00:01:41.869> in<00:01:41.990> a<00:01:42.049> rich<00:01:42.350> bronze

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
mascaras which come in a rich bronze

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.169 
mascaras which come in a rich bronze
amethyst<00:01:44.119> navy<00:01:44.989> blue<00:01:45.380> and<00:01:45.739> a<00:01:45.920> bright<00:01:46.340> electric

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 
amethyst navy blue and a bright electric

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:49.389 
amethyst navy blue and a bright electric
blue<00:01:47.420> I'm<00:01:48.110> going<00:01:48.470> to<00:01:48.619> choose<00:01:48.890> the<00:01:49.069> bright

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
blue I'm going to choose the bright

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.600 
blue I'm going to choose the bright
electric<00:01:50.090> blue<00:01:50.390> shade<00:01:50.689> I<00:01:51.340> think<00:01:52.340> this<00:01:52.429> will<00:01:52.489> be

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
electric blue shade I think this will be

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.669 
electric blue shade I think this will be
a<00:01:52.640> nice<00:01:52.880> contrast<00:01:53.479> with<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:53.959> purple<00:01:54.920> liner

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
a nice contrast with the purple liner

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:01.270 
a nice contrast with the purple liner
and<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:58.880> payoff<00:01:59.329> is<00:01:59.599> instant<00:02:00.349> you<00:02:00.649> really<00:02:01.069> get

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
and the payoff is instant you really get

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:15.330 
and the payoff is instant you really get
that<00:02:01.310> kind<00:02:01.700> of<00:02:01.789> wow<00:02:02.539> factor<00:02:03.880> immediately

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.820 

and<00:02:16.330> you<00:02:16.420> can<00:02:16.569> just<00:02:16.720> keep<00:02:16.900> building<00:02:17.200> up<00:02:18.420> for

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
and you can just keep building up for

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.040 
and you can just keep building up for
the<00:02:20.830> effect<00:02:21.280> you<00:02:21.489> want<00:02:21.700> I<00:02:22.120> don't<00:02:22.360> usually<00:02:22.660> wear

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
the effect you want I don't usually wear

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.930 
the effect you want I don't usually wear
colored<00:02:23.560> mascara<00:02:23.770> but<00:02:24.370> I<00:02:24.430> have<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.760> say<00:02:24.910> I

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
colored mascara but I have to say I

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.320 
colored mascara but I have to say I
really<00:02:25.810> genuinely<00:02:26.319> like<00:02:26.950> this<00:02:27.190> I<00:02:27.430> think<00:02:28.239> this

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
really genuinely like this I think this

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.220 
really genuinely like this I think this
could<00:02:28.480> be<00:02:28.540> my<00:02:28.660> new<00:02:29.080> look<00:02:29.319> I<00:02:29.680> like<00:02:30.220> it<00:02:30.370> a<00:02:30.400> lot<00:02:31.230> for

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
could be my new look I like it a lot for

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.780 
could be my new look I like it a lot for

blusher I'm just going to add a little

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.150 
blusher I'm just going to add a little
bit<00:02:33.910> of<00:02:34.060> pink<00:02:34.300> into<00:02:34.540> my<00:02:34.750> cheeks<00:02:35.080> just<00:02:35.980> to

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
bit of pink into my cheeks just to

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.100 
bit of pink into my cheeks just to
balance<00:02:36.370> out<00:02:36.670> not<00:02:36.940> too<00:02:37.239> colorful<00:02:37.540> because

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
balance out not too colorful because

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.620 
balance out not too colorful because
obviously<00:02:38.290> we've<00:02:38.650> got<00:02:38.680> so<00:02:39.610> much<00:02:39.790> color<00:02:40.120> now<00:02:40.480> on

the<00:02:40.750> eyes<00:02:40.930> that<00:02:41.440> I<00:02:41.650> think<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.099> blusher<00:02:42.370> should

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
the eyes that I think the blusher should

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:57.400 
the eyes that I think the blusher should
be<00:02:42.760> quite<00:02:42.970> natural-looking

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.390 

likewise<00:02:58.410> with<00:02:58.620> lips<00:02:58.920> I'm<00:02:59.130> going<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.280> use

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
likewise with lips I'm going to use

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.180 
likewise with lips I'm going to use
quite<00:02:59.610> a<00:02:59.640> natural<00:03:00.110> nude<00:03:01.110> color<00:03:03.800> so<00:03:04.800> all<00:03:05.010> the

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
quite a natural nude color so all the

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.190 
quite a natural nude color so all the
focus<00:03:05.640> is<00:03:05.790> very<00:03:05.850> much<00:03:06.210> on<00:03:06.920> my<00:03:08.810> amazing<00:03:09.810> blue

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
I think this blue mascara is making the

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.500 
I think this blue mascara is making the
whites<00:03:13.680> of<00:03:13.890> my<00:03:13.920> eyes<00:03:14.040> look<00:03:14.460> whiter<00:03:14.700> which<00:03:15.180> I'm
