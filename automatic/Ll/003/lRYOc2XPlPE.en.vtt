00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.260
 we are seeing where it is seen that 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:54.199
 we will always be said to be safe 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.809
 that we broke the supposed one is thought the 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.969
 width we leave the opening so that 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.250
 can any shark pass say 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.440
 however small , however it 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.229
 as the one who managed to break through to know 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.820
 the grid and half more than half the 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.280
 level for this imagine the diver 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.259
 lying with tap literally with 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.409
 the colt Alvarez in this case against the 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.720
 straight but almost did not manage to draw say 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.399
 a piece the man says I felt say 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.770
 as you point me goes with the nose of 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:24.560
 shark and trying to apply it and 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.060

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.740
 He throws little fish for them to come 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.470
 they approach you and you let go of the fish and 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.250
 is but he went beyond was let's say to 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.250
 take out the arm 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:41.960
 extreme level of adrenaline while being 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.630
 make a shark for here good is 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.300
 an easy colossus in fact 60 actually 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.950
 to be able to see the animal without anyone 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.710
 know of bellver I'm not like in the 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.530
 nature itself of cesare are more expensive 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.270
 people want more costs borrow 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.549
 Attention 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.250
 note that if animal attacks 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.680
 animals are you talking one clearly 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.020
 of the best of the most and as 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.989
 outstanding and that one who assured with 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.390
 the open mouth is of this tiger that 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.480
 jump the hunting let's say some people 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.989
 who had already noticed his presence and 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.720
 look what is the idea these men are going 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:23.060
 riding on elephant and there is a pasture 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.670
 obviously that suddenly the elephant is 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.040
 so nervous and say something forward if 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.480
 well there must be a tiger you can 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.519
 then begin to grab a few weights 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.110
 of meat to extract it and take the 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:38.269
 tourists on the other side and suddenly 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:42.430
 crouched tiger jumps I did not know what 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.430

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.450
 It's a tiger 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.319
 no no 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.010
 it was so shocking so shocking that 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.010
 I edited took him to the bed 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:21.970
 as a trainer of animals as life 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.740
 unknown stranger that is good usually 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.790
 occur, let's say 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:30.430
 and there are times let's say where the lion does not 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:34.470
 by the smell of a perfume that is thrown 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.470
 in clothes the stranger hits her 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:43.150
 and it's just the other 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.909
 to the fire 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.470
 are the children I talked that this is 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:49.930
 a moment that animals with a 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.930
 strange sound that is not of the 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.129
 custom that they have with the taker and I 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:04:01.420
 I think the five animals in one 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:04:03.819
 brutality in situations that are not 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.750
 natural way it is not possible to refer 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:09.989
 so many do not have a psychology either 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.989
 paranormal he is suddenly admitted to 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.989
 hits
