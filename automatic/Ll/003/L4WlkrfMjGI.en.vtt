00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.059
 hello today in tecos let's talk about a 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.769
 kind of phones that are not 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.389
 precisely those that we will see in the 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.520
 mobile world congress from here to about 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.720
 days we are going to talk to you about a telephone 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.520
 ct that is a type of phones that are 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.890
 very appropriate especially for houses that 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.660
 have more than one plant or that has 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.630
 a lot of distance between them 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.320
 stays in concrete we are going to talk to you 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.930
 of the gigaset s 820 a phone that has 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.560
 some pretty features 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.560
 Interesting 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.090
 one of the characteristics that make 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.750
 different to this phone is for example 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.490
 that the screen is touch has two 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:53.120
 also very interesting functions a 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:55.400
 is that it serves for the monitoring of children 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.650
 small or sick people when not 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.450
 we will be in the same room as 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.790
 them is not that it 's nothing new there 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.520
 appliances that are sold that already meet 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.610
 this function but here it simply 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:10.850
 integrates the function inside the phone 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.009
 of vigilance we can do that we 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.360
 send an alarm through it 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.250
 line to which the 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.280
 phone simply go to another 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.110
 the devices or through a 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.020
 external line for which it only makes 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.320
 missing a number and the phone 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.800
 will call us when the person or the 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:34.730
 child make enough noise to 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.910
 understand that the alarm has been activated 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:40.040
 a second characteristic also that 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:43.010
 we may be interested is that you can 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.730
 send SMS is simply by typing the 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.730
 on your screen 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.640
 well that's all about this 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.470
 phone we will be back soon with other 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.470
