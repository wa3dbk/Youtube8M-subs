is<00:03:57.239> a<00:03:57.269> natural<00:03:57.510> progression<00:03:58.500> for<00:03:59.250> the

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 
determinate tomatoes because when they

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:03.199 
determinate tomatoes because when they
get<00:04:00.840> to<00:04:00.989> a<00:04:01.019> set<00:04:01.290> size<00:04:01.530> they<00:04:02.250> start<00:04:02.519> flowering<00:04:02.760> I

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
get to a set size they start flowering I

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.580

they<00:05:34.970> all<00:05:35.150> just<00:05:35.390> got<00:05:35.540> fed<00:05:35.840> to<00:05:36.020> give<00:05:36.170> them<00:05:36.320> a

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
they all just got fed to give them a

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.470 
they all just got fed to give them a
boost<00:05:36.680> because<00:05:36.920> they<00:05:37.190> really<00:05:37.520> suck<00:05:38.150> the<00:05:38.300> life

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:38.480

as the vine borer enters into the stem

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.060 
as the vine borer enters into the stem
then<00:06:14.540> it<00:06:14.660> recovers<00:06:15.110> but<00:06:15.320> then<00:06:15.770> you<00:06:15.890> have

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.070 
then it recovers but then you have

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.930 
then it recovers but then you have
growing<00:06:17.000> in<00:06:17.120> there<00:06:17.300> a<00:06:17.510> big<00:06:18.440> fat<00:06:18.650> worm

system<00:06:21.740> out<00:06:21.860> as<00:06:21.980> it<00:06:22.100> grows<00:06:22.280> and<00:06:22.580> then<00:06:23.060> we're

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.180 
system out as it grows and then we're

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.820 
system out as it grows and then we're
going<00:06:23.450> to<00:06:23.480> just<00:06:23.660> end<00:06:23.780> back<00:06:23.960> here<00:06:24.230> I<00:06:24.260> really
