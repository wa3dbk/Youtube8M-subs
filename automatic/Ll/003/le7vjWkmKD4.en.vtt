not<00:05:27.560> quite<00:05:27.620> ready<00:05:28.130> yet<00:05:29.050> anyway<00:05:30.050> as<00:05:30.290> I<00:05:30.500> was

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
not quite ready yet anyway as I was

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.740 
not quite ready yet anyway as I was
saying<00:05:30.890> this<00:05:31.250> is<00:05:31.310> an<00:05:31.520> open<00:05:31.790> water<00:05:31.970> fish<00:05:32.330> so<00:05:32.570> it

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
saying this is an open water fish so it

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:39.100 
saying this is an open water fish so it
it<00:05:33.350> is<00:05:33.560> an<00:05:36.250> apprentice<00:05:37.250> in<00:05:37.430> the<00:05:37.520> wild<00:05:38.110> it's

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
it is an apprentice in the wild it's

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.890 
it is an apprentice in the wild it's
what<00:05:39.380> they<00:05:39.500> call<00:05:39.530> it<00:05:39.890> gape<00:05:40.310> and<00:05:40.520> suck<00:05:40.900> predator

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
what they call it gape and suck predator

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.950 
what they call it gape and suck predator
or<00:05:42.740> it<00:05:43.060> expands<00:05:44.060> that<00:05:44.300> very<00:05:44.570> stretchable

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
or it expands that very stretchable

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.590 
or it expands that very stretchable
mouth<00:05:45.350> and<00:05:45.740> thus<00:05:46.010> literally<00:05:46.669> sucks<00:05:47.060> the<00:05:47.330> prey

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
mouth and thus literally sucks the prey

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.370 
mouth and thus literally sucks the prey
and<00:05:48.610> it's<00:05:49.610> so<00:05:49.940> while<00:05:50.630> I<00:05:50.660> was<00:05:50.840> gonna<00:05:50.990> say<00:05:51.230> it's

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
and it's so while I was gonna say it's

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.800 
and it's so while I was gonna say it's
quite<00:05:51.530> different<00:05:51.890> than<00:05:52.130> how<00:05:52.880> it<00:05:53.090> doe<00:05:53.300> by<00:05:53.510> for

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
quite different than how it doe by for

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.650 
quite different than how it doe by for
example<00:05:54.290> makes<00:05:54.560> its<00:05:54.800> living<00:05:54.950> in<00:05:55.190> the<00:05:55.280> wild<00:05:55.660> doe

example makes its living in the wild doe
by<00:05:56.900> is<00:05:56.960> more<00:05:57.320> of<00:05:57.470> a

I<00:06:40.190> guess<00:06:40.490> they're<00:06:40.670> tired<00:06:40.910> from<00:06:41.150> chasing<00:06:41.180> each

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:41.630 
I guess they're tired from chasing each
