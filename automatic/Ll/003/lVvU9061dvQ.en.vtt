00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.970
 systovi is a young company since 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.619
 we are only four years old 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.660
 We design and manufacture 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.580
 renewable energy systems for 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.859
 improve the energy performance of 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.310
 buildings and in particular a system 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.230
 unique solar roofing activates the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.559
 active soler roof is a product 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.059
 hybrid that allows simultaneous 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.280
 make original electricity 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.260
 Photovoltaic and at the same time 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.270
 recover heat under the panels 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.160
 photovoltaics to use it to 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.160
 improving the comfort of the habitat 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.250
 we started from a fairly simple observation 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.770
 is that today at an installation 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.620
 solar photovoltaic uses only 15 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.149
 % of the solar energy it receives and 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.370
 thanks to calorie recovery 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.559
 under the panels we are improving this 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.210
 yield since in addition to the yield 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.640
 electric we associate a yield 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.340
 thermal which allows us to have 40 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.340
 at 45% total solar yield 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.219
 so technically the concept is 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.229
 relatively simple 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:25.640
 we just suck the outside air that 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.310
 we will go under the panels 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.140
 via a fan 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.520
 the air in contact with the panels are gorging 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.159
 of calories that they are everywhere 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.289
 present in our environment and 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.759
 this hot air and then re- flush 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.119
 in the house to save money 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.119
 of heating 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.270
 in 2011 we had to deal with a 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.280
 violent crisis of photovoltaics is the 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.349
 the only way out in this market 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.079
 hyper competitive was to get 

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:58.520
 differentiate through innovation 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.649
 today our roof concept 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.569
 assets represent more than 30% of our 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.610
 turnover and allowed us 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:07.369
 especially to conquer new customers 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.720
 about 50 since the beginning of the year 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.720
 thanks to this innovation
