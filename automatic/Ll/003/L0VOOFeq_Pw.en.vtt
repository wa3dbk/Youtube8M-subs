00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
so this is the mix ratio for the outdoor

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.070 
so this is the mix ratio for the outdoor
stucco<00:00:02.490> with<00:00:02.639> cement<00:00:02.939> and<00:00:03.090> lye<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:03.810> earth

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
stucco with cement and lye the earth

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:04.789 
stucco with cement and lye the earth
yeah

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
yeah

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.639 
yeah
the<00:00:05.069> earth<00:00:05.160> in<00:00:05.339> time<00:00:05.490> chuckle<00:00:06.140> the<00:00:07.140> all<00:00:07.410> the

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
the earth in time chuckle the all the

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.759 
the earth in time chuckle the all the
batches<00:00:08.069> it's<00:00:08.670> a<00:00:08.760> it's<00:00:09.030> a<00:00:09.120> part<00:00:09.360> ratio<00:00:09.960> so<00:00:10.230> each

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
batches it's a it's a part ratio so each

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.270 
batches it's a it's a part ratio so each
parts<00:00:11.190> going<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.370> be<00:00:11.429> about<00:00:11.940> this<00:00:13.099> like<00:00:14.099> that's

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
parts going to be about this like that's

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.090 
parts going to be about this like that's
one<00:00:14.460> part<00:00:15.170> we're<00:00:16.170> just<00:00:16.410> kind<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.710> rounded<00:00:17.039> a

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
one part we're just kind of rounded a

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.410 
one part we're just kind of rounded a
little<00:00:17.160> bit<00:00:17.430> not<00:00:17.580> heaping<00:00:17.940> full<00:00:17.970> but<00:00:18.270> just

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
little bit not heaping full but just

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.300 
little bit not heaping full but just
kind<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.630> rounded<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:19.590> would<00:00:19.770> be<00:00:19.859> one<00:00:20.039> part

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
kind of rounded that would be one part

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.279 
kind of rounded that would be one part
whether<00:00:21.180> it's<00:00:21.359> clay<00:00:21.570> or<00:00:21.750> whether<00:00:21.930> it's<00:00:22.080> saying

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
whether it's clay or whether it's saying

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.540 
whether it's clay or whether it's saying
but<00:00:22.769> you'll<00:00:22.920> take<00:00:23.510> you'll<00:00:24.510> have<00:00:25.160> two<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.189> these

but you'll take you'll have two of these
scoops<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.210> clay<00:00:28.050> two<00:00:28.949> parts<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.369> clay<00:00:29.580> and

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
scoops of clay two parts of clay and

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.020 
scoops of clay two parts of clay and
with<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.720> water<00:00:30.980> then<00:00:31.980> you'll<00:00:32.130> have<00:00:32.250> then

soupy so do the clay by itself first you

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.719 
soupy so do the clay by itself first you
mix<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.710> clay<00:01:22.799> bites<00:01:23.070> up<00:01:23.250> get<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.490> all<00:01:23.580> mixed

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
mix the clay bites up get it all mixed

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.450 
mix the clay bites up get it all mixed
up<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.090> what's<00:01:24.240> like<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> melted<00:01:25.460> milkshake

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
up to what's like a melted milkshake

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.100 
up to what's like a melted milkshake
pretty<00:01:26.700> runny<00:01:26.939> really<00:01:27.299> how<00:01:27.570> much<00:01:27.720> water<00:01:27.930> is

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
pretty runny really how much water is

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.730 
pretty runny really how much water is
that<00:01:28.579> it<00:01:29.579> depends<00:01:29.820> on<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.000> clay<00:01:30.270> if<00:01:30.509> it's<00:01:30.740> dry

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
that it depends on the clay if it's dry

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.859 
that it depends on the clay if it's dry
in<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.520> sand<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.939> all<00:01:33.060> varies<00:01:33.900> uh<00:01:34.040> if<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.159> put<00:01:35.400> in

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
bit more water get it till it's

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.209 
bit more water get it till it's
consistency<00:01:56.250> if<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.549> melted<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:58.040> melted<00:01:59.040> milk

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
consistency if I melted a melted milk

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.429 
consistency if I melted a melted milk
shake<00:01:59.549> you<00:02:00.149> know<00:02:00.270> like<00:02:00.450> thicker<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.960> match<00:02:01.229> up

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
shake you know like thicker to match up

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.010 
shake you know like thicker to match up
like<00:02:02.280> ketchup<00:02:02.520> maybe<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.299> little<00:02:03.540> thinner<00:02:03.810> you

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
like ketchup maybe a little thinner you

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.450 
like ketchup maybe a little thinner you
catch<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.320> but<00:02:04.469> like<00:02:04.740> hitch<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.070> might<00:02:05.159> be<00:02:05.280> fine

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
catch it but like hitch it might be fine

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.830 
catch it but like hitch it might be fine
and<00:02:06.000> then<00:02:06.149> when<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.299> get<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.659> point

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
and then when you get to that point

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.880 
and then when you get to that point
where<00:02:07.049> it's<00:02:07.170> really<00:02:07.320> runny

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
where it's really runny

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.919 
where it's really runny
then<00:02:08.459> put<00:02:08.940> your<00:02:08.970> Portland<00:02:09.420> in<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.690> put<00:02:09.810> your

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
then put your Portland in and put your

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.270 
then put your Portland in and put your
line<00:02:10.080> when<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.349> put<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.619> lime<00:02:10.800> in<00:02:10.979> there<00:02:11.069> man

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
line when you put that lime in there man

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.660 
line when you put that lime in there man
that

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
that

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.760 
that
thicken<00:02:11.880> it<00:02:12.000> up<00:02:12.120> big-time<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.319> porter<00:02:13.590> will

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
thicken it up big-time the porter will

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.970 
thicken it up big-time the porter will
thicken<00:02:13.920> it<00:02:14.099> up<00:02:14.190> some<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:15.000> then<00:02:15.830> then<00:02:16.830> when

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
thicken it up some and then then when

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.229 
thicken it up some and then then when
that<00:02:17.099> thickens<00:02:17.459> up<00:02:17.580> you'll<00:02:17.760> have<00:02:17.819> to<00:02:17.970> add<00:02:18.060> just

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
that thickens up you'll have to add just

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.970 
that thickens up you'll have to add just
a<00:02:18.330> little<00:02:18.360> bit<00:02:18.599> of<00:02:18.690> water<00:02:18.840> keep<00:02:19.560> add<00:02:19.739> just<00:02:19.890> a

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
a little bit of water keep add just a

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.550 
a little bit of water keep add just a
little<00:02:20.010> bit<00:02:20.220> of<00:02:20.280> water<00:02:20.400> until<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:20.730> gets<00:02:20.910> a

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
little bit of water until it gets a

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.540 
little bit of water until it gets a
little<00:02:22.560> thinner<00:02:22.770> than<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.130> way<00:02:23.250> you're<00:02:23.370> going

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
little thinner than the way you're going

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.320 
little thinner than the way you're going
to<00:02:23.580> use<00:02:23.760> it<00:02:23.940> which<00:02:24.090> is<00:02:24.270> just<00:02:25.819> Lulu<00:02:26.819> we're<00:02:27.150> using

to use it which is just Lulu we're using

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.680 
to use it which is just Lulu we're using
it<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.690> little<00:02:27.959> fan<00:02:28.640> see<00:02:29.640> how<00:02:29.790> see<00:02:30.420> that's<00:02:30.600> like

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
it a little fan see how see that's like

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.370 
it a little fan see how see that's like
ketchup<00:02:31.350> really<00:02:31.910> you<00:02:32.910> can<00:02:33.060> dump<00:02:33.300> it<00:02:33.450> that's

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
ketchup really you can dump it that's

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:41.930 
ketchup really you can dump it that's
the<00:02:34.530> finished<00:02:34.830> product<00:02:35.190> so<00:02:35.540> put<00:02:36.540> that<00:02:40.550> so<00:02:41.550> then

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
the finished product so put that so then

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.330 
the finished product so put that so then
this<00:02:42.239> is<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:42.480> sand<00:02:42.840> then<00:02:43.769> after<00:02:44.069> you<00:02:44.160> get<00:02:44.220> the

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
this is the sand then after you get the

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.340 
this is the sand then after you get the
port<00:02:44.550> on<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.790> lime<00:02:45.000> mix<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.930> clay<00:02:46.050> in<00:02:46.140> first

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
port on the lime mix the clay in first

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.630 
port on the lime mix the clay in first
and<00:02:46.590> port<00:02:46.769> in<00:02:46.830> line<00:02:46.950> get<00:02:47.130> it<00:02:47.250> all<00:02:47.340> whipped<00:02:47.519> up

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
and port in line get it all whipped up

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.920 
and port in line get it all whipped up
and<00:02:47.819> then<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:48.030> add<00:02:48.180> your<00:02:48.390> three<00:02:48.569> scoops

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
and then you add your three scoops

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.170 
and then you add your three scoops
around<00:02:49.080> it<00:02:49.350> scoops<00:02:49.560> of<00:02:49.709> sand<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.250> mix<00:02:50.880> it<00:02:51.030> up

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
around it scoops of sand and mix it up

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.910 
around it scoops of sand and mix it up
and<00:02:51.420> if<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:51.930> gets<00:02:52.019> stiff<00:02:52.260> it<00:02:52.380> still<00:02:52.560> will<00:02:52.739> dry

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
and if it gets stiff it still will dry

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.140 
and if it gets stiff it still will dry
that<00:02:53.130> add<00:02:53.250> just<00:02:53.400> little<00:02:53.519> bit<00:02:53.700> more<00:02:53.850> water<00:02:54.060> to

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
that add just little bit more water to

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.330 
that add just little bit more water to
it<00:02:54.299> until<00:02:55.019> add<00:02:55.440> water<00:02:55.799> till<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.069> gets<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.310> about

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
it until add water till it gets to about

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.699 
it until add water till it gets to about
that<00:02:56.640> goes<00:02:56.910> oh<00:02:57.030> this<00:02:57.330> consistency<00:02:58.049> here<00:02:58.290> it

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
that goes oh this consistency here it

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.090 
that goes oh this consistency here it
could<00:02:58.860> be<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:58.980> little<00:02:59.340> bit<00:02:59.459> thicker<00:02:59.700> but<00:03:01.100> you

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
could be a little bit thicker but you

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.860 
could be a little bit thicker but you
know<00:03:02.250> it's<00:03:02.670> easier<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.060> it's<00:03:03.330> easier<00:03:03.600> to<00:03:03.690> put

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
know it's easier to it's easier to put

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.130 
know it's easier to it's easier to put
on<00:03:03.959> a<00:03:03.989> hot<00:03:04.140> tap<00:03:04.350> like<00:03:05.130> that<00:03:05.160> and<00:03:05.700> then<00:03:06.330> then<00:03:07.049> of

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
on a hot tap like that and then then of

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.600 
on a hot tap like that and then then of
course<00:03:07.350> before<00:03:07.709> you<00:03:07.799> put<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.069> wall<00:03:08.250> on<00:03:08.459> you

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
course before you put the wall on you

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.030 
course before you put the wall on you
got<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.790> profit<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.299> put<00:03:09.480> your<00:03:09.690> mat<00:03:10.380> on<00:03:10.560> clean<00:03:10.920> it

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
what that does it reactivates the top of

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.400 
what that does it reactivates the top of
this<00:03:26.670> so<00:03:26.940> when<00:03:27.090> you<00:03:27.150> put<00:03:27.269> the<00:03:27.390> others<00:03:27.600> other<00:03:28.170> on

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.140 
this so when you put the others other on
earth<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.890> Portland<00:03:29.250> that's<00:03:29.370> in<00:03:29.549> the<00:03:29.700> clay

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
earth the Portland that's in the clay

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.130 
earth the Portland that's in the clay
that's<00:03:30.299> hinder<00:03:30.510> will<00:03:30.660> they'll<00:03:30.780> help<00:03:30.930> bind

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
that's hinder will they'll help bind

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.020 
that's hinder will they'll help bind
them<00:03:31.290> together<00:03:31.440> and<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.190> fact<00:03:32.400> is<00:03:32.549> that<00:03:32.640> he'll

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
them together and the fact is that he'll

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.640 
them together and the fact is that he'll
probably<00:03:33.209> probably<00:03:33.840> want<00:03:33.959> to<00:03:33.989> hit<00:03:34.350> that<00:03:34.410> again

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
probably probably want to hit that again

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.500 
probably probably want to hit that again
because<00:03:35.340> it's<00:03:35.640> so<00:03:35.700> hot<00:03:35.940> out<00:03:36.060> here<00:03:36.090> but<00:03:36.390> then

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
because it's so hot out here but then

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:43.910 
because it's so hot out here but then
blocks<00:03:36.750> are<00:03:36.930> hot<00:03:37.730> mm-hmm<00:03:41.780> yep<00:03:42.780> anyway<00:03:43.739> but

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
blocks are hot mm-hmm yep anyway but

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.020 
blocks are hot mm-hmm yep anyway but
that's<00:03:44.040> kind<00:03:44.250> of<00:03:44.310> ratio<00:03:44.489> you<00:03:44.670> said<00:03:44.850> you<00:03:44.940> were

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
that's kind of ratio you said you were

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.699 
that's kind of ratio you said you were
going<00:03:45.209> to<00:03:45.299> yeah<00:03:45.840> you<00:03:46.260> wanted<00:03:46.500> something

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
going to yeah you wanted something

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.120 
going to yeah you wanted something
forget<00:03:47.280> that<00:03:47.489> don't<00:03:47.760> do<00:03:47.910> that
