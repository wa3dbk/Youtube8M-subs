00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:10.020
 smaller float plus 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.020

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.890
 thickening enclose their there 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.620
 traditional at the tip of the antenna which 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.920
 i'm doing five millimeter here and doing 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.910
 their three pieces are flat this time on this 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:29.100
