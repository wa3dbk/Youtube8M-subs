00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 guys very turned jackman and this that 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.359
 comes here in my mind at that time is 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.010
 an original object called the key the 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.050
 Treasure is achieved by having luck 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.490
 opening the ether chests after 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.469
 complete public movements of the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.420
 fallen so they do not know in these 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.699
 moments there is a mini active event in 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.170
 flashes maracas ereros lobos where 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.580
 We received pedralbes contracts and a 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.619
 tower and we have to hunt about 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.779
 objectives that come out in certain areas of 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.130
 planet in a new public event if 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.449
 want to know more about that click on the 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.490
 image that is here on screen or the 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.840
 link create in the description returning 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.279
 to the theme of the treasure key once 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.719
 completed public items we have 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.399
 about a minute and a half to 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.899
 look for a cult chest that will appear 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.730
 near where we completed the event 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.219
 This chest contains materials from 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.200
 planets lumen engrams and if we have 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.149
 very lucky we can leave this 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.920
 key the treasure now many will 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.510
 they ask what this key is for 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.739
 once elder expressions as before 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.420
 to give home the logos of the next 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.520
 Tuesday to the comment of new size is 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.260
 opens a hidden room and there we use 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.539
 these keys to open treasures and 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.890
 receive rewards and the other people 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.960
 end of the price gain we do not receive 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.609
 automatically one of these keys but 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.860
 represent if we have more of these 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.810
 we can open some extra chests to the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.570
 final and you will receive a reward 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.860
 at least that we assume now with this 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.240
 video I come to teach you two things 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.950
 related to this event that does not 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.259
 I mentioned in yesterday's video the first 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.909
 is a trick or gray to be able to have 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.009
 chance to double or even triple 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.869
 the chests after completing each 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.850
 event to do that we will have to 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.830
 complete the event find the chest 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.170
 open it and once we receive the 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.490
 reward and as quickly as possible to a 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.470
 area other than the one in 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.970
 chest we know that we change of area 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.289
 when in the bottom left corner 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.240
 the title of the new area in the 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:37.799
 that we entered once we carried that title 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.509
 We returned to the area where the chest was 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.220
 and if we are still in time we can 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.200
 return to remove the treasures from the chest 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.030
 Now remember that when you complete the 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.189
 event we only have a minute and a half 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.810
 with the active chest so it only gives us 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.580
 chances of leaving the area and going back to 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.899
 enter about two or three times but still 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.250
 well this can increase quite 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.920
 our chances of getting the key 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.840
 treasure my suggestion is to do it in venus 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.610
 instead of the earth the moon since the 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.319
 areas where the chests appear in venus 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.240
 they are smaller and it is faster to change 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:04.619
 from one area to another so we know the 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.420
 wolves box will last until the 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.039
 Tuesday when he left the ecce but the 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.239
 public events will remain active 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.679
 although we do not know if we will continue 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.030
 receiving the keys 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.250
 so I recommend you take advantage of this 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.230
 trick while you can still 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.670
 also tell them that you can only 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.770
 carry a maximum of five keys in the 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.880
 inventory so keep those in the 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.160
 deposit if you want to continue collecting 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.080
 the other thing that I come to show you with 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.090
 this video is this vehicle beauty 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.890
 this is known as the heavy bike or 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.850
 heavy barracuda and you can get 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.490
 patrolling in venus 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.570
 I have personally found it 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.640
 only in the area of ​​things of the 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.670
 amber and I do not know of another area where 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.200
 may appear this paik is bigger and 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.640
 resistant that typical of the fallen 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.040
 we sometimes find on earth 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.990
 moon or in - also shoots cannons 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.030
 arc in force machine gun and when doing 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.980
 the lateral movement or turn if you're in 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.480
 the air loose exclusive pumps such 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.970
 which is like the spider tank of the 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.709
 fallen now is obviously not the 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.150
 they can stay permanently and 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.950
 eventually if you get many years 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.540
 you will notice but if you wanted to mount this new 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.340
 vehicle that we will surely use in 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.260
 some missions see you can know 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.970
 where to find it usually appear 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.470
 between things and this area so just 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.510
 keep looking from cave to cave until 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.190
 that comes out also using a les 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.750
 can help a lot to complete the 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.760
 public events of the fallen and do 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.739
 easier to get the chests so 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.600
 no guys this has been all for this 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.910
 video should your comment if you have any 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.590
 doubt still also a while ago 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.350

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:30.140
 that will come in the patch 1.2 points 0.1

 both more mature weapons and on 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.130
 specials that we know will come in 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.290
