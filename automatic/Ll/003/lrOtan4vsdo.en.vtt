00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.270
 Hello 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.030
 today is very 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.360
 follow the short botanical garden 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.070
 and by our numerous requests 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.279
 visitors a visitor of our site we 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.340
 talk about the pomegranate tree here 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.919
 very many are trying to grow it and 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.259
 some difficulties arise with the care 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:33.200
 these plants our consultant 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:36.100
 Igor joints honestly tell about it 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.020
 plants how to care for him 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:43.040
 Hello 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.840
 dwarf game on one of the oldest 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.519
 indoor plants for a long time 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.170
 grown in rooms but last 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:52.909
 time is asking a lot of questions on 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.699
 about how to grow on 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:57.649
 in fact there is nothing complicated grenades 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.379
 grows well in a room very well 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:03.050
 bears fruit regularly and if necessary 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.239
 so that it grows well in the room 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.960
 he definitely needs a cool wintering 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.550
 and carefully examine it on the subject 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.460
 parasites because 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.270
 and pests very much on this plant 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.110
 attack various pests it and 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:23.960
 flaps and various for and thrips and 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.860
 mealybug and spider mite are very 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.110
 often attacks 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.450
 that is, the more often you will process 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:35.049
 plants from pests so you are there better 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.049
 feels like the earth needs enough 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.039
 noble before the gun should be very 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.260
 nobly more humus 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:45.460
 it often transship 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:47.560
 to fresh land well at least once a year if 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.320
 the plant has reached such a size as 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.300
 our grenades are big enough but 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.390
 about 80 centimeters is a little tree 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.220
 or 3 mm is already quite a lot we do not 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.190
 transplanted not pass it 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.110
 growing in this pot for more than ten 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.650
 years but just replace the top layer 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.950
 soil 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.990
 there is enough to have some kind of spoon 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.630
 or Sovkoma scrape the upper soil and 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.770
 sprinkle fresh humus or good 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.270
 some kind of fertile soil soil 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:20.260
 feeding is necessary especially 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.700
 flowering fruiting blooms 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.790
 beautiful enough but not always 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.880
 tying the fruit this is the reason that 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.120
 not enough feeding do not fall and such 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.340
 substances and another moment when you are at home 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.100
 will grow pomegranate during 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.590
 budding it can not be turned 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.380
 around her axis which side she stood 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.959
 to the window to the glass in the same sides it 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:48.700
 must stand it cannot be twisted otherwise 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:51.900
 all fruits and buds fall here because 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:55.460
 that she is a plant adapted for 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.870
 turning the fruits and flowers another table 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.430
 although fishing lines can easily 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.240
 turns to change its direction 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.430
 with you records of light then when 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.140
 plants do not bloom and do not bear fruit 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.200
 it can be turned 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.240
 form the crown do pruning and so 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.450
 further well this is the most important thing 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.790
 watch for pests because 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.670
 they are very, very winter spoil it here 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.650
 so many questions about flying around 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.480
 the leaves are just like that with 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.210
 spider mite can be yourself 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.550
 it is usually in the spider mite as 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.310
 still probably if that's not cool 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.620
 wintering i.e. from hot 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.330
 temperature during heater during 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.340
 heating season if the plant 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:43.460
 stand on a windowsill on a bare 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:45.680
 windowsill root ball 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.050
 who is in the pot he is strong 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.680
 cooled by cold air which 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.300
 down to the glass down crown is 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.700
 in the warm air that rise in 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.330
 battery and therefore it turns out such 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.490
 dissonance 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.650
 and the plant 2 itself feels that is 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.540
 need to raise the birth itself a little 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.040
 above the sill at least 10 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.560
 centimeters put some either 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.700
 traffic either turned upside down to 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.030
 she was a little taller 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.610
 but in this case it will be necessary to strengthen 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.830
 lighting add some kind of lamp 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.410
 extra light here and Olivier water 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.080
 spray that is if not reduce 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.970
 the temperature is necessary 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.460
 shine yes above all if we 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:29.300
 high temperature in winter is more 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.720
 long light day and more plentiful 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.880
 watering 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.620
 because when cool if 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.080
 screen off some room 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.940
 from film for example yes you can create 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.130
 cool wintering temperature perfect 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.250
 for its existence at its zenith 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.740
 that is, to protect this area on 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.940
 window sill 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:51.110
 the window sill just shut out the moon 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:53.600
 that kind of rei some films hang so 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.780
 he will still say that he dropped it together 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.090
 this is not a reason to emit us no this is not 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.520
 reason must be created for him optimal 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.930
 conditions 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.840
 plenty of water but take care not to 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:08.990
 pour it too including have it 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:12.920
 can grow can can grow can 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:15.500
 better to do pruning cardinal and 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:19.610
 look closely at it so logic 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.020
 edible they are edible but not 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.020
 highly 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.960
 very tasty yes that is not such a pomegranate 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:30.550
 how to market to sell land at well here 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:33.819
 would not push him not be afraid and 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:36.430
 of course yes they want to try here 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:37.240
 this grenade who is bringing in here now 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.560
 there is 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:44.470
 for liza and we watched when raft 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.870
 Mature 50 don't even crack but they 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.659
 greet you ever time 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:52.930
 collect yes that's what you can grow 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:55.210
 girl from seed and alternates like 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.860
 alternates well too and is sold in 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.500
 stores very often now you have become 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:03.190
 bring in a store for sale because 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:05.830
 borders well this is the same this is how he to 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.659
 pruning is bad plants 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.150
 perfectly tolerates pruning 

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:13.690
 only important it must be on time and 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:15.610
 right and that is while growing here 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.469
 such when now from shoots new 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.060
 grows best not touch it not 

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:21.240
 cut well 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:24.480
 cuts usually for the winter to 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:29.980
 the plant is better to feel better 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:31.750
 some easier or there it is clear how often 

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.610
 water it here asks well this 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.760
 probably just touches everything here 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:39.670
 depends on the time of year and in general 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:43.270
 ground moisture should be this important 

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:47.080
 understand thank you very much for the exhaustive 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:49.600
 the information I recall we were now in 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.820
 Nizhny Novgorod Botanical Garden 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:56.430
 on our website we will come here again and again 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:56.430
 tell you about interesting plants
