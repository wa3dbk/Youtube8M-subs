stabilizer in the body and this version

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.859 
stabilizer in the body and this version
is<00:00:17.220> much<00:00:17.400> cheaper<00:00:17.730> it's<00:00:18.060> actually<00:00:18.359> 2<00:00:18.600> times

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
is much cheaper it's actually 2 times

is much cheaper it's actually 2 times
cheaper<00:00:19.109> than<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.859> one<00:00:20.010> with<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.310> VC<00:00:20.760> so<00:00:21.359> when

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
cheaper than the one with the VC so when

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.849 
cheaper than the one with the VC so when
you<00:00:21.570> open<00:00:21.840> up<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.080> box<00:00:22.289> you'll<00:00:22.500> see<00:00:22.680> some

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
stuff and you also get a manual on

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.519 
stuff and you also get a manual on
telling<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.240> each<00:00:27.420> part<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.019> lens<00:00:28.170> lens

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
telling you each part of the lens lens

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.589 
telling you each part of the lens lens
so<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.980> lens<00:00:29.130> itself<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.789> how<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.119> operate

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
so the lens itself and how to operate

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.450 
so the lens itself and how to operate
the<00:00:30.810> lens<00:00:30.990> which<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.740> don't<00:00:31.800> think<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.130> have<00:00:32.309> to

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
the lens which I don't think you have to

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.709 
the lens which I don't think you have to
read<00:00:32.610> at<00:00:32.730> all<00:00:32.820> it's<00:00:33.030> pretty<00:00:33.239> self-explanatory

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
read at all it's pretty self-explanatory

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.430 
read at all it's pretty self-explanatory
and<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:35.430> also<00:00:35.579> get<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.910> warranty<00:00:36.630> which<00:00:37.200> is

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
and you also get a warranty which is

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.970 
and you also get a warranty which is
pretty<00:00:37.680> nice<00:00:40.610> and<00:00:42.590> as<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.680> can<00:00:43.739> see<00:00:43.800> right

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
pretty nice and as you can see right

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.069 
pretty nice and as you can see right
here<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.250> do<00:00:44.370> get<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.730> case<00:00:45.149> with<00:00:45.420> lens<00:00:45.750> the

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
here you do get a case with lens the

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.840 
here you do get a case with lens the
case<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.440> pretty<00:00:46.710> nice<00:00:46.980> but<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.460> don't<00:00:47.700> think

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
case is pretty nice but I don't think

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.910 
case is pretty nice but I don't think
that<00:00:48.090> I'll<00:00:48.270> use<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.930> often<00:00:49.230> because<00:00:49.739> I'll

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
that I'll use it that often because I'll

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.830 
that I'll use it that often because I'll
just<00:00:50.100> put<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.550> lens<00:00:50.760> in<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.030> camera<00:00:51.360> bag<00:00:51.570> if

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
just put the lens in the camera bag if

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.100 
just put the lens in the camera bag if
you<00:00:51.960> want<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.230> travel<00:00:52.500> around<00:00:52.649> with<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:54.110> but

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
you want to travel around with it but

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.479 
you want to travel around with it but
it's<00:00:55.260> still<00:00:55.350> nice<00:00:55.620> for<00:00:55.829> them<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.100> include<00:00:56.309> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
it's still nice for them to include the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.639 
it's still nice for them to include the
bag<00:00:56.699> in<00:00:56.910> case<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.510> want<00:00:57.719> an<00:00:57.899> extra<00:00:58.170> protection

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
bag in case you want an extra protection

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.369 
bag in case you want an extra protection
for<00:00:58.800> your<00:00:58.949> lens<00:00:59.600> so<00:01:00.600> let's<00:01:00.840> go<00:01:00.960> ahead<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.260> take

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
for your lens so let's go ahead and take

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.709 
for your lens so let's go ahead and take
the<00:01:01.500> lens<00:01:01.710> out<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.340> bag<00:01:02.520> itself<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.329> we

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
the lens out of the bag itself and we

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.260 
the lens out of the bag itself and we
also<00:01:03.899> have<00:01:04.260> one<00:01:04.589> more<00:01:04.739> thing<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.070> here<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.519> I

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
also have one more thing in here and I

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.570 
also have one more thing in here and I
think<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.350> lens<00:01:07.650> hood<00:01:07.830> yes<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
think it is the lens hood yes it is the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.429 
think it is the lens hood yes it is the
lens<00:01:08.790> hood<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.150> there's<00:01:09.720> nothing<00:01:10.080> else<00:01:10.200> in

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
lens hood and there's nothing else in

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.469 
lens hood and there's nothing else in
here<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:11.040> that's<00:01:11.490> pretty<00:01:11.670> much<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:12.000> about<00:01:12.299> the

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
here so that's pretty much it about the

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.960 
here so that's pretty much it about the
bag<00:01:12.770> so<00:01:13.770> first<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.189> all<00:01:14.220> let's<00:01:14.369> take<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.520> look<00:01:14.760> at

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
bag so first of all let's take a look at

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.179 
bag so first of all let's take a look at
the<00:01:15.330> lens<00:01:15.659> hood<00:01:15.869> first<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.409> take<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.830> out<00:01:16.920> from

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
the lens hood first so take it out from

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.760 
the lens hood first so take it out from
this<00:01:17.310> blue<00:01:17.610> plastic<00:01:17.970> bag<00:01:18.509> it's<00:01:19.290> actually<00:01:19.740> a

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
this blue plastic bag it's actually a

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.030 
this blue plastic bag it's actually a
pretty<00:01:20.310> long<00:01:20.640> lens<00:01:20.970> hood<00:01:21.210> but<00:01:21.600> it's<00:01:22.020> not<00:01:22.799> that

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
pretty long lens hood but it's not that

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.380 
pretty long lens hood but it's not that
we'll<00:01:23.220> build<00:01:23.400> actually<00:01:23.640> its<00:01:23.909> milled<00:01:24.240> from

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
we'll build actually its milled from

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.359 
we'll build actually its milled from
plastic<00:01:24.990> but<00:01:25.560> it's<00:01:25.710> still<00:01:25.860> nice<00:01:26.040> for<00:01:26.310> the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
plastic but it's still nice for the

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.070 
plastic but it's still nice for the
price<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.790> they<00:01:26.909> even<00:01:27.150> include<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.689> lens<00:01:27.990> hood

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
price that they even include a lens hood

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.950 
price that they even include a lens hood
for<00:01:28.380> us<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:30.210> next<00:01:30.420> thing<00:01:30.570> let's<00:01:30.600> take<00:01:30.930> a

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
for us and the next thing let's take a

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.380 
for us and the next thing let's take a
look<00:01:31.170> at<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.650> lens<00:01:31.979> itself<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.640> we<00:01:33.000> do<00:01:33.150> have

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
look at the lens itself and we do have

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.420 
look at the lens itself and we do have
this<00:01:33.659> poison<00:01:34.140> candy<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.770> can't<00:01:35.040> eat<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.340> if

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
this poison candy you can't eat it if

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.830 
this poison candy you can't eat it if
you<00:01:35.490> want<00:01:35.610> but<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.000> don't<00:01:36.090> really<00:01:36.390> recommend
