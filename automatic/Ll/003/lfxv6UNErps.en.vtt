review<00:00:07.830> today<00:00:08.570> they<00:00:09.570> are<00:00:09.599> on<00:00:09.950> second<00:00:10.950> 9<00:00:11.099> butter

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
review today they are on second 9 butter

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.650 
review today they are on second 9 butter
balls<00:00:12.049> this<00:00:13.049> is<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.309> 70<00:00:14.309> millimeter<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:15.450> da

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
balls this is a 70 millimeter a da

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.310 
balls this is a 70 millimeter a da
version<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.850> the<00:00:17.850> wheel<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:20.570> yeah<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.600> recently

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
version of the wheel and yeah I recently

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.670 
version of the wheel and yeah I recently
yesterday<00:00:22.740> picked<00:00:23.220> up<00:00:23.600> another<00:00:24.600> pair<00:00:24.900> these

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
yesterday picked up another pair these

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.029 
yesterday picked up another pair these
are<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.920> 65<00:00:26.460> millimeter<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.300> da<00:00:28.039> the

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
are the 65 millimeter a da the

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.590 
are the 65 millimeter a da the
difference<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.640> this<00:00:30.269> comes<00:00:30.630> with<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:32.600> film

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
difference is this comes with the film

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.709 
difference is this comes with the film
on<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:34.219> not<00:00:35.219> broken<00:00:35.520> in<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.239> this<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.600> the

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
on it not broken in and this is the

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.479 
on it not broken in and this is the
stone-ground<00:00:37.050> pre-broken<00:00:38.040> in<00:00:38.370> finnish<00:00:39.270> and

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.670 

this<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.700> really<00:00:45.239> nice<00:00:45.809> wheel<00:00:46.170> i'm<00:00:46.410> not

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
this is a really nice wheel i'm not

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.510 
this is a really nice wheel i'm not
gonna<00:00:46.829> lie<00:00:47.510> it<00:00:48.510> slides<00:00:49.050> really<00:00:49.829> well<00:00:51.020> I<00:00:52.520> like

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
gonna lie it slides really well I like

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.450 
gonna lie it slides really well I like
it<00:00:53.550> after<00:00:54.000> you've<00:00:54.600> been<00:00:54.780> sliding<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.260> while

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
it after you've been sliding a while

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.900 
it after you've been sliding a while
there<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:57.449> becomes<00:00:57.989> perfect<00:00:58.770> like<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.690> wheel

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
there it becomes perfect like the wheel

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.600 
there it becomes perfect like the wheel
it's<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.870> name<00:01:04.080> describes<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.830> all<00:01:04.979> buttery

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
it's the name describes it all buttery

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.929 
it's the name describes it all buttery
it's<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.150> buttery<00:01:06.510> slide<00:01:06.930> it's<00:01:07.770> pretty<00:01:08.310> quiet

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
it's a buttery slide it's pretty quiet

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.080 
it's a buttery slide it's pretty quiet
the<00:01:09.600> only<00:01:09.720> chatters<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.470> ever<00:01:10.650> got<00:01:10.920> on<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.430> was

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
the only chatters I ever got on it was

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.399 
the only chatters I ever got on it was
when<00:01:12.510> I'm<00:01:13.460> going<00:01:14.460> fast<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:15.119> I'm<00:01:15.600> holding<00:01:16.140> out<00:01:16.259> my

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
when I'm going fast I I'm holding out my

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.609 
when I'm going fast I I'm holding out my
slide<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:19.130> it<00:01:20.780> once<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.900> start<00:01:22.110> slowing<00:01:22.350> down

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
slide and it once you start slowing down

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.710 
slide and it once you start slowing down
and<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.009> just<00:01:23.310> certainly<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:24.270> just<00:01:24.540> barely

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
and so I just certainly it just barely

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.120 
and so I just certainly it just barely
is<00:01:24.930> like<00:01:25.130> and<00:01:26.600> I<00:01:27.650> really<00:01:28.650> like<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:28.890> about

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
is like and I really like that about

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.810 
is like and I really like that about
this<00:01:29.579> because<00:01:30.180> other<00:01:30.689> than<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.290> just

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
this because other than that it just

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.450 
this because other than that it just
slides<00:01:32.820> forever<00:01:33.270> just<00:01:33.540> like<00:01:34.310> it's<00:01:35.310> like

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
slides forever just like it's like

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.630 
slides forever just like it's like
getting<00:01:36.030> warm<00:01:36.350> butter<00:01:37.350> putting<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.369> on<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
getting warm butter putting it on the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.249 
getting warm butter putting it on the
bread<00:01:38.850> except<00:01:39.509> on<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.960> pavement<00:01:40.490> um<00:01:42.259> the

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
bread except on the pavement um the

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.690 
bread except on the pavement um the
reason<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.619> haven't<00:01:43.770> poured<00:01:44.040> these<00:01:44.250> yet<00:01:44.490> is

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
reason I haven't poured these yet is

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.230 
reason I haven't poured these yet is
because<00:01:45.110> it's<00:01:46.110> been<00:01:46.320> pretty<00:01:46.590> cold<00:01:46.860> outside

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
because it's been pretty cold outside

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:56.179 
because it's been pretty cold outside
lately<00:01:48.590> see<00:01:49.590> there's<00:01:50.189> just<00:01:51.090> snow<00:01:52.310> and<00:01:55.189> that

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
lately see there's just snow and that

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.580 
lately see there's just snow and that
causes<00:01:57.119> because<00:01:57.810> when<00:01:57.990> it's<00:01:58.170> hotter<00:01:58.350> it's

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
causes because when it's hotter it's

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.789 
causes because when it's hotter it's
easier<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:59.009> core<00:01:59.250> but<00:02:00.240> yeah<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:01.110> measured<00:02:01.619> this

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
easier to core but yeah I measured this

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.429 
easier to core but yeah I measured this
and<00:02:02.040> this<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.340> 59<00:02:03.210> millimeters<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.290> is

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
and this is a 59 millimeters and this is

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.380 
and this is a 59 millimeters and this is
65<00:02:06.290> you<00:02:07.290> could<00:02:07.469> see

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
65 you could see

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.800 
65 you could see
yeah<00:02:09.369> if<00:02:10.369> I<00:02:10.490> had<00:02:10.520> a<00:02:10.640> 70<00:02:11.060> millimeter<00:02:11.450> this<00:02:11.630> would

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
yeah if I had a 70 millimeter this would

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.490 
yeah if I had a 70 millimeter this would
look<00:02:11.930> way<00:02:12.200> smaller<00:02:12.590> but<00:02:12.830> in<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.250> 60<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:14.500> one

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
look way smaller but in the 60 the one

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.280 
look way smaller but in the 60 the one
thing<00:02:15.710> I<00:02:15.830> don't<00:02:15.890> like<00:02:16.130> about<00:02:16.250> this<00:02:16.970> or<00:02:17.960> this

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
thing I don't like about this or this

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.330 
thing I don't like about this or this
one<00:02:18.530> is<00:02:18.920> you<00:02:19.610> have<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:19.820> break<00:02:20.000> that<00:02:20.060> in<00:02:21.340> but

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
one is you have to break that in but

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.400 
one is you have to break that in but
once<00:02:22.850> you<00:02:22.970> break<00:02:23.090> it<00:02:23.270> in<00:02:23.420> it's<00:02:23.720> super<00:02:24.140> smooth

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
once you break it in it's super smooth

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.240 
once you break it in it's super smooth
and<00:02:25.180> with<00:02:26.180> this<00:02:26.390> there<00:02:27.140> pre-broken<00:02:27.560> in<00:02:27.890> even

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
and with this there pre-broken in even

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.180 
and with this there pre-broken in even
though<00:02:28.370> I<00:02:28.400> I<00:02:28.580> really<00:02:29.120> don't<00:02:29.390> think<00:02:29.450> that<00:02:30.190> it

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
though I I really don't think that it

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.920 
though I I really don't think that it
matters<00:02:31.400> because<00:02:31.730> you<00:02:32.030> still<00:02:32.240> need<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.510> slide

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
matters because you still need to slide

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:40.210 
matters because you still need to slide
on<00:02:33.110> it<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.440> get<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:34.190> same<00:02:34.370> side<00:02:34.610> as<00:02:34.760> this<00:02:39.220> yeah

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
on it to get the same side as this yeah

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.930 
on it to get the same side as this yeah
that's<00:02:40.820> pretty<00:02:41.120> much<00:02:41.240> it<00:02:44.530> I<00:02:45.700> have<00:02:46.700> no<00:02:46.910> idea

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
that's pretty much it I have no idea

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.770 
that's pretty much it I have no idea
what<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:47.450> contact<00:02:47.900> patch<00:02:48.080> is<00:02:48.140> but<00:02:49.540> it's<00:02:50.540> got<00:02:50.720> a

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
what the contact patch is but it's got a

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.400 
what the contact patch is but it's got a
pretty<00:02:51.260> fast<00:02:51.470> roll<00:02:51.830> speed<00:02:52.130> and<00:02:52.989> it's<00:02:53.989> pretty

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
pretty fast roll speed and it's pretty
