00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 less than a month of Christmas is already 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.759
 the effervescence in the small 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.160
 laboratory of yann haut rhin to saint 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.440
 Michel in the herm for two weeks this 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.599
 young pastry baker installed there 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.130
 at two and a half years in this commune the 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.310
 period is devoted to manufacturing 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.590
 chocolates in his hands five to six 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.810
 a thousand pieces are thus made 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.820
 hence the importance of starting this 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.699
 work upstream we go to the advanced 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.250
 since considering the quantities but hey who has 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.830
 made but it takes a lot of 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.700
 time so they were forced to to get 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.219
 to do that right now 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.510
 and then later we have others 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.690
 preparations that will arrive for them 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.620
 parties with the logs and log and then 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.450
 all 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.200
 all the festive products we will be able to 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.180
 find in this period so as 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.020
 all the bakers who will make their 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.090
 chocolates for these end of year celebrations 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.210
 the range of chocolates extends from 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.910
 prolific praline chocolate with 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.239
 rice balls or sparkling sensation or 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.400
 still the orange or lemon aiguillettes 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.590
 topped with their dark chocolate or white 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.630
 obviously passing through 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.540
 the inevitable truffle or coffee fragrances 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.090
 or chocolate but also molded candies 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.979
 and if the manufacturing technique does 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.170
 presents no major difficulties 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.140
 however, care must be taken 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.299
 respect the temperature curve of the 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.950
 precious substance in order to preserve 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.470
 its shiny appearance 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.150
 the most complicated is to have a 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.619
 good glossy chocolate and who 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.579
 crystallize well one who has a texture 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.740
 brittle in red but we are not not 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.380
 not too thick not unpleasant to 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.090
 eat we have to find our 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.990
 chocolate and make them follow a 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.390
 temperature curve 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.500
 so that's the hardest part of it 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.750
 that we do I break and very hot in 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.640
 temperature they are decent for their 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.000
 come back after so you have to be very 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.800
 accurate since if we do not have this 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.630
 we do not have this precision we will have 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.720
 chocolates that will be term that will be 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.000
 not pretty at the sight what not pretty 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.610
 not salable the smell released from this 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.010
 mixture of sugar and cocoa plunges us 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.910
 literally in the Christmas mood 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.560
 if its dark brown and messy 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.880
 to work chocolate remains anyway 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.080
 very nice 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.910
 it's at the test on the needles is 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.650
 chocolate orange aiguillettes 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.720
 so the principle is simple we tap 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.130
 the fork is to remove 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.670
 the chocolate surplus and always have 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.920
 recipe 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.440
 this finesse on our flights are at 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.100
 to finish his funds in it is eaten all 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:37.370
 only one can be anytime 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:41.450
 so that's it truffles we poached 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.160
 the la ganache yesterday on your on leaves 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.640
 to cool as it should be 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.860
 truffle 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.510
 short it's a product it produces they 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.790
 have fashion can serve chocolate 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.640
 a treat that remains a safe bet 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.030
 to offer and enjoy at the time of 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.670
 holidays 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.980
 chocolate is always when he 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.360
 arrives at the store people are finally the 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.340
 chocolate it looks like it's expected 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.380
 almost it's a bit like tradition 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.040
 Christmas is the tradition of chocolate 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.650
 who will arrive 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.330
 and then it is this fair was made 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.780
 see the chocolate arrives in store 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.489
 it's pretty nice colors is his 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.820
 bouncy woman people are 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:19.190
 happy that the life micro store with 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.470
 easter christmas is a good time for 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.299
 pastry chefs and to savor these 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.180
 delights just make a little 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:30.010
 stop at the comfortable loaf at yann's and 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.010
