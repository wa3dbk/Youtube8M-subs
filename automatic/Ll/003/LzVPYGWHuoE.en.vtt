00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
some more characters here so I'm going

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.550 
some more characters here so I'm going

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
to get some all of them that way and

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.089 
to get some all of them that way and
that<00:05:37.560> takes<00:05:37.770> time<00:05:37.860> and<00:05:39.530> what<00:05:40.530> else<00:05:40.680> we<00:05:40.949> got

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:41.099 
that takes time and what else we got

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:44.060 
that takes time and what else we got
let's<00:05:41.310> have<00:05:41.969> a<00:05:42.030> quick<00:05:42.210> look<00:05:42.259> defenses<00:05:43.259> so<00:05:44.039> I

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
let's have a quick look defenses so I

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.409 
let's have a quick look defenses so I
could<00:05:44.219> build<00:05:44.340> a<00:05:44.400> cannon<00:05:44.580> and<00:05:44.789> I<00:05:45.150> probably

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 
could build a cannon and I probably

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:46.790 
could build a cannon and I probably
should<00:05:45.960> because<00:05:46.139> otherwise<00:05:46.409> I'm<00:05:46.620> going<00:05:46.710> to

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
should because otherwise I'm going to

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.469 
should because otherwise I'm going to
get<00:05:46.919> into<00:05:47.190> some<00:05:47.340> serious<00:05:47.370> bother<00:05:47.909> you<00:05:48.270> can<00:05:48.360> see

the<00:05:48.599> range<00:05:48.750> of<00:05:48.840> effect<00:05:49.229> that<00:05:50.099> it<00:05:50.219> has<00:05:50.250> so<00:05:51.150> I

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
the range of effect that it has so I

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.290 
the range of effect that it has so I
want<00:05:51.419> to<00:05:51.539> set<00:05:51.840> it<00:05:51.960> up<00:05:52.020> here<00:05:52.620> I<00:05:52.650> think<00:05:53.240> yeah<00:05:54.240> i'm

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
to take three minutes to build i can

friends and i can do all that good stuff

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:07.999 
friends and i can do all that good stuff
and<00:06:04.159> um<00:06:05.159> it<00:06:05.819> is<00:06:06.150> very<00:06:06.479> much<00:06:06.659> as<00:06:07.500> I<00:06:07.680> say<00:06:07.860> it's

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:08.009 
and um it is very much as I say it's

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:09.680 
and um it is very much as I say it's
very<00:06:08.099> much<00:06:08.340> in<00:06:08.550> the<00:06:08.639> style<00:06:08.699> of<00:06:09.090> clash<00:06:09.360> of<00:06:09.479> clans

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
very much in the style of clash of clans

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.450 
very much in the style of clash of clans
but<00:06:10.199> it's<00:06:10.319> like<00:06:10.469> the<00:06:10.560> next<00:06:10.830> generation<00:06:11.310> of

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
but it's like the next generation of

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.170 
but it's like the next generation of
them<00:06:11.699> in<00:06:11.789> terms<00:06:11.969> of<00:06:12.150> visual<00:06:12.539> polish<00:06:14.180> whether

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
them in terms of visual polish whether

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.930 
them in terms of visual polish whether
or<00:06:15.419> not<00:06:15.569> you<00:06:16.139> want<00:06:16.349> another<00:06:16.800> sort<00:06:17.190> of<00:06:17.280> strategy

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
or not you want another sort of strategy

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.240

kind<00:06:24.090> of<00:06:24.150> games<00:06:24.300> it<00:06:24.719> might<00:06:24.870> be<00:06:24.960> worth<00:06:25.110> waiting

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
kind of games it might be worth waiting

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.520
