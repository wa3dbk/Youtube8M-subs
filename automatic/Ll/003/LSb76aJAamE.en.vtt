00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:07.050
 another typical problem of probability is 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.050
 a deck of Spanish cards 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.250
 where we remove 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:21.260
 8 and 9 then we are left with a 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.260
 40 cards deck 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.660
 then they can ask us for example the 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.660
 probability of an ace coming out 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:37.070
 There are 40 letters 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.070
 and how many aces are there in the Spanish deck 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:48.130
 well it's not called what's it called 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.130
 I say Spanish deck and say ace liÃ¡ndola 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:54.760
 probability of it coming out 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.760
 a glass 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.100
 40 cards how many cups are in the deck 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:10.790
 4 of 40 let's simplify 1 of 10 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.540
 1 of 4 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.540
 probability 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.160
 that comes out 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.000
 figure 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:29.810
 a figure is a jack a horse or a 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.810
 king there are 40 cards and how many are figures 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.680
 three for each suit there are four suits 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.619
 we say 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.990
 let's go for the nice 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.840
 what is the most difficult what is the 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:57.759
 probability of it coming out 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.759
 jack does not figure 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.220
 I mean sota figure or coarse 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.930
 how many more letters 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.400
 here 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.409
 and coarse 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.090
 but you can not add because you have to 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:30.870
 keep in mind that between twelve o'clock 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:33.960
 figures are the three that are 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:37.440
 vast then it would be 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.260
 nine figures that are not coarse plus ten 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.970
 coarse 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.970
 In 1940 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.890
 what is the probability that it comes out 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.460
 figure 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.460
 and golds 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.920
 there are 40 cards and how many are of figures and 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.920
 golds 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.980
 13 40 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.250
 this is another typical problem where we 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.560
 they ask for things that are too complicated but 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.480
 you have to know what you are with 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.480
 working in this case the letters
