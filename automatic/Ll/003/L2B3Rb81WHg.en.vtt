00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:09.250
 with this is the double pedal of privilege 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.290
 902 belle p model was a pedal 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.880
 exactly like us with all 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.980
 the same functions 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.230
 however the dual channel has a function 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.880
 that practically no other cock has 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.419
 that is the possibility have turned 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:29.429
 in 2010 simple you throwing batter 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:29.429
 here placed here 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:43.430
 you connect the link you have two 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:45.110
 simple pedals this here buy one 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.780
 simple business the fashion attention of 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.850
 different way and you can use two 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:58.070
 Opponent groups solo world as the 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:01:01.430
 Beater channel has dual memory 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.830
 Plastic felt face of this memory 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.059
 you still have two screws here 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.160
 fixing him 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:11.650
 that is, it leaves the batter in a 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.650
 very firmly positioned on the pedal 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.000
 one of the most interesting functions of this 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.700
 pedal is that it makes it independent 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.540
 the inclination of the shoe with 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.880
 batsman 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.490
 then you run that part through 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.110
 From this screw you position the 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.210
 tilting the shoe higher or higher 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.520
 down the way you thought 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.990
 convenient for you you lock bolt 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.450
 this match will be stopped in position 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.340
 that you put there through that 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.130
 center screw 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.960
 you position the slope of the batter 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.960
 this way you can press the 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.570
 pedal exactly as you need it 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.979
 gaining speed and practicality in 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.340
 defense of the end 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.799
 is a very interesting function 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.450
 we still have in the pedal this central axis 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.940
 that makes it quite enough 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.159
 stable so you do not give up for what 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.720
 it will not wear out in time 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.560
 so it is a piece that helps in 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.899
 general stability another function 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.769
 of this pedal that is on the shaft 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.470
 central 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:14.989
 it comes from a quite double current 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.989
 resistant and it has a screw until 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:22.070
 behind you that you loose and that piece 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:24.830
 bring her back later 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.290
 it lets you play it heavier 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.510
 with more power for those who like 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.970
 play rock'n'roll metal you play 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.810
 with strong pedal you use of 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.700
 more powerful and more volume 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.350
 if you run all the way 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.160
 You have to get lighter and more 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.739
 fast 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:47.690
 So you still have all the 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:49.580
 gradually from that channel 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:54.070
 linking this power thing with 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:58.160
 volume or speed with defense 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:00.950
 another thing is this part of the blackberry 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.490
 quite far enough strong and you 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.830
 here is a locking screw 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:11.410
 addition to those shown below and then 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.410
 you position the blackberry where you want it 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.800
 screw 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.240
 Do you think that this part of 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.120
 my expression dates another 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.860
 expression of dead but you find the 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.100
 door here against the door where you 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.710
 lock and here you have not really 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:34.820
 needing treatment there is screw 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:38.150
 that tightens and does not leave the grip on the 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:40.070
 part of the rim of the globe it is lateral and 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.630
 with a key you work on 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.950
 moment has nothing is not I knew of 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.870
 that you have to put already 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.270
 vine cutting it already comes with its own 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.260
 butterfly that with that enough 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.000
 practical and easy 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.400
 in addition it has the two large one of 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.660
 each side to stay on the floor did not let 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.660
 he rush forward 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.910
 in addition we still have every part of 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:06.580
 Velcro underneath that works 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.580
 along with the water do not leave the pedal
