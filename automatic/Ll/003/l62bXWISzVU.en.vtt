00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:20.730
 Well , the number of times I took a bus in October from my hometown in six o'clock is four years . 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:26.550
 Uh rattling and weigh the streets almost half the district round stone so very 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:31.950
 I have come across a lot of elders to get a long distance . 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:41.070
 It was a precious time to hear and share the story . 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:45.810
 I lost my child and leukemia, now I sent it to heaven, 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:53.010
 I also like the elders who sell poets and help with the leukemia. 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:55.050
 Also the father of daughters nearly eight people Finish evil son filled out her husband Boop 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:00.270
 Another glaring offshore elderly, etc. 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:06.590
 And they are very different from each other. 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:12.659
 I have met so many people, so every one of them is really precious to me. 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:17.009
 I think it was time. So I met the elders and I had love for my child. 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:20.759
 How big is it? 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:26.280
 Not entirely common denominator. Yes. 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:29.969
 I can not forget many of them. Well, they came to a real reality. 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:35.310
 The expression that the elders like is the reality 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:43.649
 I thought that someday I would get off the country bus. 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:47.789
 Uh, really, it's been a hell of a lot since I have to get off the bus in four years. 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:53.369
 Well, the faces of the elders that I've met in the past have gone through so much. 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:59.459
 On the last bus, last bus, 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:05.009
 Haejusyeot just gave a farewell party answers japbu also released Ginseng 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:10.560
 I was so desperately loved that I could get so much love. 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:13.260
 Well, if you look back, you are our elders, 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:19.200
 It was a valuable opportunity to be informed . 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:25.130
 I'm so sad that the last broadcast teams are now tears 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:31.500
 But thanks to four years of hard bus ride and elderly love 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:32.910
 Yesterday, 50 times the day of the broadcast, the ceremony will be held at the Cap in public service. 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.840
 I wrote it. 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.140
 Ah, so the fact that I always floats off Guinea 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:44.040
 uh 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:47.520
 Because I ve got kids ages 18 to 45, but insignificant to really unavoidable 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:53.760
 New life seems to have given me the greatest gift. 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:03:00.030
 You can get the beauty of the well and leave when you clap and celebrate your elders 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:03.180
 When I gave expression to be a disappointment to those who at the same time, Ah now, inspectors searched times 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:08.640
 This kid who is growing up is really a cloak. 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:10.470
 Because our elders are my master's age, 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:17.760
 I think it's precious. 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:22.230
 Yes. But the fact that the wind son, daughter thing and anything you want nawateum healthy 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:27.320
 But now it's more than seven months now. 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:34.519
 I was a little bit sick because I was late. 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:39.630
 If I had said to her that I've somehow old, but what appointed Jecheon yiragon 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:44.240
 Still, rather than leaving one of the daughters and leaving the world , 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:49.310
 I know because I am a little less proven wetlands 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:53.660

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:56.540
