00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 when the wave as they are waiting 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.279
 that they are very well and the video 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.460
 tutorial that we are going to do now is how 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.460
 make one more mask one does not 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.440
 get to turn it into a shadow or 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.900
 something like that well first let's go to 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.240
 start by making a mask or doing 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:27.420
 a mother this time I liked it 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:29.910
 is the one that I have already finished from my mask 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.940
 It is very important that before you start 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.739
 make your mask you right click 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.780
 modifiers and disable show him 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.120
 now make this look a kind of 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.309
 shadow we're just going to corrector 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.129
 of secondary color we pull the 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.350
 predetermined to our scene our 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.180
 mask to the project we want the 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.030
 shadows look white 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.730
 we just pull all these little things 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.860
 to the positive sense and there they are we want 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.899
 the mask is black 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.480
 we just pull all these little things 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.850
 in the negative or to the left and 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.850
 there is the black mask 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.620
 you can choose the color you want to 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.820
 choose some color your favorite color 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.660
 simply open its tallet parts to 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.820
 where is chrome and lancia you open it and I 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.040
 I want to choose the rose for example there 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.620
 you're setting it up until you had 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.570
 the pink color there is already pink now 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.790
 I want it to look yellow 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.780
 let's grab and we're going to click on the 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.670
 yellow 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.950
 there it is then now let's do 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.500
 something a little difficult you can do it 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.630
 you with the text or put many letters 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.729
 but to save myself time I'm going to use 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.340
 a wallpaper I'm going to put all this in 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.440
 white color I'm going to put the mask on 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.750
 white color so that it holds well 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.690
 colors and then it's easy what you're going to 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.960
 to do is in this icon you are going to go in 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:55.210
 darken and as it absorbs nothing else what 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.830
 of what the wallpaper but the problem 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.170
 here is that if you want to put some 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.060
 fund will not detect it look now 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.470
 they saw then what we're going to do is 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.470
 render this part 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.130
 you are going to eliminate this layer will matter 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.350
 the project that we render now we are going to 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.390
 put the bottom this orange and you will 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.490
 say traumatic key as always 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.360
 create determined and you're going to select the 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.160
 black color 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.050
 and there you configure it until it 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.880
 see and then you already put creative you 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.560
 it's going to be amazing, for example 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.560
 I did something like this 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.640
 one 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.620
 the mask that I made, I 'm going to 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.920
 give away here in the description you can 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.710
 download and I also created this transition 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.930
 you just put it on the chroma effect in the 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.300
 chromatic key you put the green and already 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.320
 it is in case you like it if you like it good 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.390
 and if not then neither way 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.780
 thank you very much for watching the video and we 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.780
 we see
