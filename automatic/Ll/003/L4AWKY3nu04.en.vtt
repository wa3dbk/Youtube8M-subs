00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:04.419
 but then a bit Wednesday 18 March the exact circumstances 

00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:09.210
 Ajax did the ballet offer but come on Ajax's birthday after 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:12.069
 collision especially on the bar I love to party 

00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:15.069
 voka tons of grain to dvv 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:18.579
 at the rail in an open 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:19.890
 abi into 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.970
 arjen robben cadÃ©e and tilburg the de 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.929
 roj 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:32.380
 a sign by the sea is the stone 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.650
 match this is being played on the future 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.060
 but good enough at the sports park the home of the last few weeks 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.700
 the extreme is doing well 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.940
 so that's in the competition 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.990
 8 points for number two groningen and a good interception of this 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.520
 relationships 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.520
 possibility for ajax and the only goal 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.390
 boban is lazic 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.390
 because even in the Dutch national team for players up to 15 years old 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.030
 wal mart precursor to the man of her sixtieth but makes he would be too 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.780
 goal 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.780
 place again 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.270
 now thin the cement 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.100
 because there it tries from a distance a good shot at the start dangerous the 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.260
 keeper babos 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.789
 and then it is 2 0 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:26.970
 bram barhorst 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.970
 pang da with him to difficult shot for the keeper of az week 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.680
 and then balls can wrestle 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.850
 that is 3 points lower, ajax opens in the competition 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.240
 the one with this is an opportunity 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.240
 but the ball ended up in the side net 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.380
 that was also the rest position 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.580
 ajax continues to attack 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.580
 who is a piano of velsen 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.569
 show them something 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.609
 handsome pass is correct 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:15.019
 the ball then ends up at el hassnaoui 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.019
 shot is cracked 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.379
 after a nice solo the sixteen-meter will start to dam 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:26.379
 header from barhorst and then it is already 3 0 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.059
 the great action of 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:32.059
 juliano van velsen 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:36.819
 afraid of spiders but in the far corner 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.949
 of velsen 

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:41.669
 longer player in the sea 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:45.019
 and also strong on the ball 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.309
 new a cross 

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:50.349
 libyan diplomat 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:51.929
 then there wasn't 

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:54.929
 makes nicer movements to the fourth round etc 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:58.989
 great promotions and then a goal 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.989
 boban is lazic 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.679
 header placed 

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:07.679
 untenable for az goalkeeper 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.259
 that he struck 

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:16.879
 zundert is done and a mistake in the back of months barakzai 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.839
 then the system 

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:24.109
 it doesn't matter anymore 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:26.219
 it is a shame 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:29.369
 that you heartily 

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:32.099
 everyone therefore the final score 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.369
 and the wim kwakman can be happy 

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:35.600
 for derbies 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.600
 you can't lose it, he said afterwards 

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:43.089
 Ajax is a good business with whomever thinks 

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:45.419
 especially by the sea 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:47.599
 Competitors Groningen also thinks 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.599
 with 3 0 from haarlem 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.419
 and therefore the difference still remained 8 points between ajax and groningen 

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:02.029
 and then we find twice again the third opponent of Ajax next week 

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:03.529
 8 

00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:08.039
 fulmars to be joined with us on the right row are nine points out 

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:11.039
 seventeen games 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:16.209
 and then to another leader Ajax A2 they too played well at the shovel park 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.090
 enough against it 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.329
 the seaside therein 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.279
 also a derby 

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:25.589
 a week earlier, days in the week were based on a doherty bonus 

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:29.629
 become no fewer than seven in the successors 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.719
 among other competition 

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:36.719
 all the loaded derbies between the sea in ajax 

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:41.809
 this possibility leaders from a free kick 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.669
 lorenzo burnet with a good free kick 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:46.909
 and also one 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:50.039
 good rescue of the goalkeeper from the seaside 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:53.039
 singles 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:56.830
 difference between seaside and ajax 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.830
 thirteen points 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:03.839
 then I might think there 

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:06.800
 if ajax takes home life points 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.800
 who 3 Dutch 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:13.789
 with the news the webbing 

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:17.699
 if you have a clean wood 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:21.360
 it is a hard game or the flag goes up and the game goes on and on 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:24.979
 another course in the sixteen meter 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:30.449
 Violation of the rules are coffee 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:33.979
 you can also bumped 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:39.299
 consultants behind the ball can bump you into something opposite this heemskerk 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.659
 between both teams from Amsterdam South 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:45.659
 al assad 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:48.589
 e mail file 

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:50.719
 in the second half 

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:56.400
 and ajax or baby try different chances and roubaix yanic 

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:59.399
 wildschut with the edenaren does not count 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.110
 Amsterdam seen by the referee 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.800
 there could not be a hard game 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.020
 maybe so 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.360
 to see farmers 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.360
 it is certainly not one thing and that is a pity for the team 

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:23.659
 from gery vink 

00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:26.129
 the fourth 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:29.050
 continue duarte 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.050
 a shot from distance from this club 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:38.229
 the equalizer does this 

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:42.069
 look around you and it seems the motto 

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:46.940
 ajax looking for the equalizer 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.300
 Lilian I was unlucky to teach you that shot too 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.800
 these goals 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.009
 that's too bad 

00:06:56.009 --> 00:06:59.149
 they have a visit to mr van damme for ajax 

00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:04.419
 and so there they are too strong for the veh die vink team 

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:13.679
 the third defeat for ajax a2 because at sea there is nothing again with one 

00:07:13.679 --> 00:07:14.559
 dog 

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:19.169
 competitor van damme knows how to win sixteen of petrel earring 

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:24.360
 then we see that the difference between ajax and is second in the preliminary round in which 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.050
 only three points 

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.050
 by the sea we are in fifth place 

00:07:29.569 --> 00:07:31.949
 right-hand row is supplied by growers 

00:07:31.949 --> 00:07:36.189
 at the bottom we find three points all alone for petrels
