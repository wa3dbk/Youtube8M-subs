going<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.409> be<00:01:52.530> super<00:01:52.799> competitive<00:01:53.490> at<00:01:53.670> this

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
going to be super competitive at this

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.330 
going to be super competitive at this
point<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.140> don't<00:01:55.530> have<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.710> whole<00:01:56.009> lot<00:01:56.040> to

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
point so I don't have a whole lot to

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.499 
point so I don't have a whole lot to
lose<00:01:56.549> if<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.909> don't<00:01:57.090> do<00:01:57.390> good<00:01:57.600> in<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.840> show<00:01:58.079> and

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
lose if I don't do good in a show and

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.910 
lose if I don't do good in a show and
the<00:02:02.390> thing<00:02:03.390> with<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:04.200> feel<00:02:04.409> like<00:02:04.649> for

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
the thing with that is I feel like for

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.520 
the thing with that is I feel like for
me<00:02:05.210> there<00:02:06.210> there<00:02:06.600> are<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.750> lot<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:06.960> benefits

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
me there there are a lot of benefits

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.589 
me there there are a lot of benefits
that<00:02:07.649> kind<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.129> outweigh<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.759> possibility<00:02:09.569> of

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
that kind of outweigh the possibility of

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.840 
that kind of outweigh the possibility of
placing<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.379> little<00:02:10.590> bit<00:02:10.709> higher<00:02:10.920> when<00:02:11.190> I'm<00:02:11.280> not

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
placing a little bit higher when I'm not

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.490 
placing a little bit higher when I'm not
certainly<00:02:12.210> going<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.420> do<00:02:12.570> well<00:02:12.780> just<00:02:12.810> because

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
certainly going to do well just because

not<00:02:17.670> going<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:17.970> be<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.540> people<00:02:18.960> that<00:02:19.050> have

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
not going to be that of people that have

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.600 
not going to be that of people that have
been<00:02:19.200> lifting<00:02:19.710> for<00:02:19.950> five<00:02:20.160> or<00:02:20.190> ten<00:02:20.580> years

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
longer than me which is likely going to

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.230 
longer than me which is likely going to
happen<00:02:22.920> since<00:02:23.190> i<00:02:23.370> am<00:02:23.520> only<00:02:23.670> 20<00:02:24.470> so<00:02:26.240> basically

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
happen since i am only 20 so basically

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.070 
happen since i am only 20 so basically
Jason<00:02:27.810> mentioned<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.830> biggest<00:02:29.310> thing<00:02:30.080> with

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
those lower body fat numbers there even

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.050 
those lower body fat numbers there even
if<00:02:37.260> they're<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.770> most<00:02:37.890> dedicated<00:02:38.190> person

if they're the most dedicated person
ninety-five<00:02:39.630> percent<00:02:39.870> of<00:02:40.200> people<00:02:41.000> will<00:02:42.000> end

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
ninety-five percent of people will end

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.720 
ninety-five percent of people will end
up<00:02:43.050> breaking<00:02:43.290> down<00:02:43.680> because<00:02:44.130> their<00:02:44.280> minds

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
up breaking down because their minds

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.400 
up breaking down because their minds
playing<00:02:45.030> tricks<00:02:45.360> on<00:02:45.570> them<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.050> it's<00:02:46.200> going<00:02:46.350> to

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
playing tricks on them and it's going to

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.140 
playing tricks on them and it's going to
cause<00:02:46.620> them<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:47.040> make<00:02:47.220> decisions<00:02:47.250> that<00:02:48.030> they

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
cause them to make decisions that they

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.710 
cause them to make decisions that they
wouldn't<00:02:48.390> normally<00:02:48.450> make<00:02:48.960> and<00:02:49.800> I<00:02:50.720> totally

wouldn't normally make and I totally

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.210 
wouldn't normally make and I totally
feel<00:02:51.930> like<00:02:52.110> he<00:02:52.290> wasn't<00:02:52.500> saying<00:02:52.830> that<00:02:53.100> these

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
people are weak minded that's just what

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.650 
people are weak minded that's just what
happens<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.550> them<00:02:56.700> when<00:02:56.880> they<00:02:56.970> get<00:02:57.090> contest

that wants to do well but it's kind of

cool for me wanting to kind of get
inside<00:03:08.670> my<00:03:08.880> own<00:03:08.910> head<00:03:09.120> and<00:03:09.890> really<00:03:10.890> see<00:03:11.130> what

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
inside my own head and really see what

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.850 
inside my own head and really see what
mental<00:03:11.850> state<00:03:12.150> I'm<00:03:12.360> out<00:03:12.630> with<00:03:12.840> food<00:03:13.260> and<00:03:13.590> my

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
mental state I'm out with food and my

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.320 
mental state I'm out with food and my
own<00:03:14.040> body<00:03:14.370> when<00:03:15.090> I<00:03:15.120> get<00:03:15.360> to<00:03:15.510> that<00:03:15.540> point<00:03:17.300> so<00:03:18.300> I

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
own body when I get to that point so I

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.020 
own body when I get to that point so I
think<00:03:18.600> at<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.020> point<00:03:19.440> that<00:03:19.620> i'm<00:03:19.740> at<00:03:20.030> being

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
think at the point that i'm at being

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.060 
think at the point that i'm at being
able<00:03:21.420> to<00:03:21.540> look<00:03:21.720> in<00:03:21.900> my<00:03:22.050> mind<00:03:22.320> like<00:03:22.500> that<00:03:22.830> and

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
able to look in my mind like that and

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.920 
able to look in my mind like that and
really<00:03:23.280> see<00:03:23.640> how<00:03:23.790> i<00:03:23.820> react<00:03:24.300> will<00:03:24.540> give<00:03:24.750> me<00:03:24.870> a

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
really see how i react will give me a

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.220 
really see how i react will give me a
huge<00:03:25.290> advantage<00:03:25.500> in<00:03:26.070> the<00:03:26.190> future<00:03:26.720> even<00:03:27.720> even

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
huge advantage in the future even even

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.260 
huge advantage in the future even even
if<00:03:28.320> i<00:03:28.440> do<00:03:28.500> have<00:03:28.800> a<00:03:28.860> prep<00:03:29.190> coach<00:03:29.400> just<00:03:29.820> knowing

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
if i do have a prep coach just knowing

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.390 
if i do have a prep coach just knowing
how<00:03:30.510> i<00:03:30.540> will<00:03:31.050> react<00:03:31.380> better<00:03:31.680> i<00:03:31.830> think<00:03:32.250> will

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
how i will react better i think will

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.820 
how i will react better i think will
give<00:03:32.580> me<00:03:32.760> an<00:03:32.850> edge<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.450> like<00:03:34.170> i<00:03:34.320> said<00:03:34.380> i<00:03:34.710> think

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
give me an edge and like i said i think

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.610 
give me an edge and like i said i think
that<00:03:35.250> outweighs<00:03:35.720> the<00:03:36.720> possibility<00:03:37.350> of<00:03:37.380> doing

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
that outweighs the possibility of doing

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.320 
that outweighs the possibility of doing
a<00:03:37.800> little<00:03:37.950> bit<00:03:38.130> better<00:03:38.340> just<00:03:38.430> having<00:03:38.730> a<00:03:39.120> prep

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
a little bit better just having a prep

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.050 
a little bit better just having a prep
coach<00:03:39.650> when<00:03:40.650> i'm<00:03:40.920> probably<00:03:41.400> not<00:03:41.700> going<00:03:42.000> to

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
coach when i'm probably not going to

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.550 
coach when i'm probably not going to
place<00:03:42.300> that<00:03:42.510> will<00:03:42.720> anyhow<00:03:43.170> or<00:03:43.320> at<00:03:43.410> least

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
place that will anyhow or at least

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.520 
place that will anyhow or at least
that's<00:03:43.770> what<00:03:43.920> I'm<00:03:44.040> thinking<00:03:44.720> so<00:03:45.720> another

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
that's what I'm thinking so another

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.160 
that's what I'm thinking so another
reason<00:03:47.040> another<00:03:47.370> huge<00:03:47.970> huge<00:03:48.510> reason<00:03:48.960> why<00:03:48.990> I

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
reason another huge huge reason why I
