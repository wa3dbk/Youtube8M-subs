hey guys welcome back to another lesson
on<00:00:17.210> KJ<00:00:17.540> rious<00:00:17.810> this<00:00:18.740> one<00:00:18.950> we're<00:00:19.460> calling<00:00:19.820> the

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:19.940 
on KJ rious this one we're calling the

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.040 
on KJ rious this one we're calling the
funky<00:00:20.300> foot<00:00:20.710> now<00:00:22.120> for<00:00:23.120> those<00:00:23.360> of<00:00:23.540> you<00:00:23.630> students

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
funky foot now for those of you students

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.090 
funky foot now for those of you students
of<00:00:24.140> mine<00:00:24.290> that<00:00:24.500> have<00:00:24.590> been<00:00:24.680> with<00:00:24.830> me<00:00:24.860> for<00:00:25.070> a

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:25.100 
of mine that have been with me for a

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.640 
of mine that have been with me for a
little<00:00:25.220> bit<00:00:25.340> of<00:00:25.460> a<00:00:25.520> long<00:00:25.700> time<00:00:26.260> this<00:00:27.260> is

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
little bit of a long time this is

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.550 
little bit of a long time this is
actually<00:00:28.130> a<00:00:28.370> do-over<00:00:28.670> because<00:00:29.300> I<00:00:29.780> realized

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
actually a do-over because I realized

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.930 
actually a do-over because I realized
that<00:00:30.620> I<00:00:30.740> didn't<00:00:30.920> explain<00:00:31.250> it<00:00:31.430> very<00:00:31.460> well<00:00:31.760> at

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
that I didn't explain it very well at

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.000 
that I didn't explain it very well at
all<00:00:32.029> you<00:00:32.329> guys<00:00:32.480> definitely<00:00:32.719> let<00:00:33.140> me<00:00:33.170> know<00:00:33.350> that

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
all you guys definitely let me know that

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.229 
all you guys definitely let me know that
this<00:00:34.129> could<00:00:34.309> been<00:00:34.460> explained<00:00:34.940> a<00:00:35.030> little<00:00:35.120> bit

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
this could been explained a little bit

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:36.880 
this could been explained a little bit
better<00:00:35.449> so<00:00:36.050> that's<00:00:36.410> what<00:00:36.530> we're<00:00:36.649> doing<00:00:36.859> right

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
better so that's what we're doing right

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.739 
better so that's what we're doing right
now<00:00:37.039> we're<00:00:37.550> going<00:00:37.670> to<00:00:37.730> put<00:00:37.879> a<00:00:37.910> click<00:00:38.210> to<00:00:38.420> it<00:00:38.570> and

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:38.749 
now we're going to put a click to it and

00:00:38.749 --> 00:00:40.869 
now we're going to put a click to it and
we're<00:00:39.289> going<00:00:39.409> to<00:00:39.440> put<00:00:40.010> some<00:00:40.159> timing<00:00:40.399> to<00:00:40.640> it<00:00:40.789> as

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
we're going to put some timing to it as

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:41.229 
we're going to put some timing to it as
well

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
well

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.770 
well
so<00:00:42.730> for<00:00:43.730> the<00:00:43.789> rest<00:00:43.999> of<00:00:44.120> you<00:00:44.239> guys

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
so for the rest of you guys

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.919 
so for the rest of you guys
this<00:00:45.409> film<00:00:45.739> is<00:00:46.010> actually<00:00:46.539> something<00:00:47.539> that<00:00:47.719> you

00:00:47.919 --> 00:00:47.929 
this film is actually something that you

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:50.290 
this film is actually something that you
can<00:00:48.289> use<00:00:48.499> as<00:00:48.769> an<00:00:48.980> introduction<00:00:49.640> into<00:00:49.789> some<00:00:50.149> off

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
can use as an introduction into some off

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.169 
can use as an introduction into some off
timing<00:00:50.659> stuff<00:00:51.079> as<00:00:51.319> well<00:00:51.530> because<00:00:52.179> technically

00:00:53.169 --> 00:00:53.179 
timing stuff as well because technically

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:56.469 
timing stuff as well because technically
this<00:00:53.510> Phil<00:00:53.899> starts<00:00:54.589> on<00:00:54.800> the<00:00:55.489> 2<00:00:55.850> count

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:56.479 
this Phil starts on the 2 count

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:00.040 
this Phil starts on the 2 count
alright<00:00:57.019> so<00:00:57.319> one<00:00:57.739> two<00:00:58.550> the<00:00:58.940> dubidouxs<00:00:59.179> right

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
alright so one two the dubidouxs right

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.309 
alright so one two the dubidouxs right
and<00:01:00.729> the<00:01:01.729> important<00:01:02.269> thing<00:01:02.329> to<00:01:02.600> practice<00:01:02.809> here

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:03.319 
and the important thing to practice here

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:05.259 
and the important thing to practice here
is<00:01:03.469> starting<00:01:04.370> a<00:01:04.430> fill<00:01:04.610> on<00:01:04.760> the<00:01:04.879> 2<00:01:05.030> count

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
is starting a fill on the 2 count

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:06.969 
is starting a fill on the 2 count
especially<00:01:05.479> a<00:01:05.810> kick<00:01:06.110> fill<00:01:06.350> like<00:01:06.560> this<00:01:06.770> it's

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
especially a kick fill like this it's

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.459 
especially a kick fill like this it's
kind<00:01:07.280> of<00:01:07.369> complex<00:01:07.969> the<00:01:08.689> sticking<00:01:09.079> of<00:01:09.200> it<00:01:09.320> is

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:09.469 
kind of complex the sticking of it is

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.770 
kind of complex the sticking of it is
strange<00:01:10.430> it<00:01:10.759> touches<00:01:11.149> on<00:01:11.270> a<00:01:11.299> lot<00:01:11.390> of<00:01:11.600> different

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
strange it touches on a lot of different

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.100 
strange it touches on a lot of different
elements<00:01:12.200> of<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:12.649> drum<00:01:12.890> set<00:01:13.659> but<00:01:14.659> I<00:01:14.810> leave

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
elements of the drum set but I leave

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.200 
elements of the drum set but I leave
this<00:01:15.290> one<00:01:15.500> to<00:01:15.649> you<00:01:15.770> guys<00:01:15.979> practice<00:01:16.729> it<00:01:16.880> if<00:01:17.060> you

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
this one to you guys practice it if you

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.120 
this one to you guys practice it if you
choose<00:01:17.509> to<00:01:17.780> just<00:01:18.350> to<00:01:18.500> get<00:01:18.649> a<00:01:18.680> better<00:01:18.829> feeling

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
choose to just to get a better feeling

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.279 
choose to just to get a better feeling
for<00:01:19.280> off<00:01:19.640> timing<00:01:20.030> starting<00:01:20.600> fills<00:01:20.780> on<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:20.990> two

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
for off timing starting fills on the two

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.109 
for off timing starting fills on the two
especially<00:01:21.710> complex<00:01:22.399> patterns<00:01:22.939> between

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
especially complex patterns between

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:24.760 
especially complex patterns between
hands<00:01:23.570> and<00:01:23.750> feet<00:01:23.960> but<00:01:24.350> I<00:01:24.590> would<00:01:24.710> recommend

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
hands and feet but I would recommend

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.069 
hands and feet but I would recommend
giving<00:01:25.399> it<00:01:25.549> a<00:01:25.640> try<00:01:25.789> at<00:01:26.149> least<00:01:26.210> just<00:01:26.630> so<00:01:26.810> you

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
giving it a try at least just so you

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:28.120 
giving it a try at least just so you
know<00:01:27.229> that<00:01:27.350> you<00:01:27.409> can<00:01:27.500> start<00:01:27.740> to<00:01:27.799> fill<00:01:27.920> in<00:01:28.070> the

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
know that you can start to fill in the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.349 
know that you can start to fill in the
two-count<00:01:28.750> it's<00:01:29.750> in<00:01:29.930> triplet<00:01:30.380> timing<00:01:30.799> and<00:01:31.359> it

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:32.359 
two-count it's in triplet timing and it

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:46.510 
two-count it's in triplet timing and it
goes<00:01:32.509> like<00:01:32.659> this

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.760 

what's<00:01:47.520> even<00:01:47.700> going<00:01:47.850> on<00:01:48.270> there<00:01:48.660> yeah<00:01:49.200> that's

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
what's even going on there yeah that's

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.890 
what's even going on there yeah that's
the<00:01:50.040> thing<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:51.000> can<00:01:51.180> know<00:01:51.300> what's<00:01:51.510> going<00:01:51.810> on

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
the thing you can know what's going on

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.510 
the thing you can know what's going on
because<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.290> know<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:52.920> your<00:01:52.950> head<00:01:53.220> what<00:01:53.430> the

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
because you know in your head what the

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.000 
because you know in your head what the
timing<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:53.940> it<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.150> anyway<00:01:54.900> so<00:01:55.410> there's

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
timing of it is anyway so there's

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.260 
timing of it is anyway so there's
there's<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.400> few<00:01:56.610> different<00:01:56.880> ways<00:01:56.970> that<00:01:57.030> you

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
there's a few different ways that you

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.570 
there's a few different ways that you
can<00:01:57.390> practice<00:01:57.870> this<00:01:58.050> if<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:59.040> want<00:01:59.220> to<00:01:59.280> start

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
can practice this if you want to start

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.340 
can practice this if you want to start
on<00:01:59.730> the<00:01:59.940> three<00:02:00.240> count<00:02:00.480> and<00:02:00.660> make<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:01.020> more<00:02:01.170> of

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
on the three count and make it more of

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:15.520 
on the three count and make it more of
like<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> regular<00:02:01.830> sounding<00:02:02.550> fill<00:02:02.820> like<00:02:03.270> this

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.480 

alright<00:02:16.530> so<00:02:16.590> that's<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.860> first<00:02:17.040> way<00:02:17.280> that<00:02:17.310> you

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
alright so that's the first way that you

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.949 
alright so that's the first way that you
can<00:02:17.640> practice<00:02:17.820> it<00:02:18.180> if<00:02:18.300> you<00:02:18.390> want<00:02:18.570> to<00:02:18.630> just<00:02:18.750> cut

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
can practice it if you want to just cut

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.560 
can practice it if you want to just cut
out<00:02:19.110> those<00:02:19.860> first<00:02:20.550> strokes<00:02:20.970> if<00:02:21.150> we<00:02:21.240> start<00:02:21.480> on

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
out those first strokes if we start on

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:22.280 
out those first strokes if we start on
the<00:02:21.660> two<00:02:21.840> width

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
the two width

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.410 
the two width
make<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.370> sound<00:02:23.520> more<00:02:23.640> like<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.910> regular<00:02:24.030> fill

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
make it sound more like a regular fill

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.150 
make it sound more like a regular fill
there's<00:02:24.959> another<00:02:25.200> way<00:02:25.350> to<00:02:25.410> practice<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:26.010> but

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
there's another way to practice it but

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.860 
there's another way to practice it but
let's<00:02:26.790> go<00:02:26.910> over<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.120> full<00:02:27.300> sticking<00:02:27.630> of<00:02:27.780> it

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
let's go over the full sticking of it

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.240 
let's go over the full sticking of it
and<00:02:27.959> then<00:02:28.050> I'll<00:02:28.140> show<00:02:28.320> you<00:02:28.380> this<00:02:28.560> second<00:02:29.190> way

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
and then I'll show you this second way

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.890 
and then I'll show you this second way
that<00:02:29.280> you<00:02:29.430> can<00:02:29.520> start<00:02:29.910> on<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.209> two<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.720> what

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
that you can start on the two and what

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:31.900 
that you can start on the two and what
might<00:02:31.050> help<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.380> with<00:02:31.500> that

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
might help you with that

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.940 
might help you with that
alright<00:02:32.910> so<00:02:33.150> sticking<00:02:36.620> we're<00:02:37.620> going<00:02:37.740> to<00:02:37.800> use

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
alright so sticking we're going to use

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.630 
alright so sticking we're going to use
this<00:02:38.220> is<00:02:38.400> our<00:02:38.520> anchor<00:02:38.760> stroke<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.420> two<00:02:39.690> counts

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
this is our anchor stroke the two counts

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.170 
this is our anchor stroke the two counts
because<00:02:41.640> it's<00:02:42.030> going<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.180> go<00:02:43.400> write<00:02:44.400> your<00:02:45.030> next

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
because it's going to go write your next

00:02:45.180 --> 00:03:00.490 
because it's going to go write your next
strokes<00:02:45.480> right<00:02:45.690> there<00:02:55.250> say<00:02:56.250> see<00:02:56.670> what<00:02:56.820> we<00:02:56.880> did

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.660 

so<00:03:01.500> use<00:03:01.970> use<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.120> two<00:03:03.330> as<00:03:03.630> your<00:03:04.670> brain's

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
so use use the two as your brain's

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.130 
so use use the two as your brain's
notification<00:03:06.450> is<00:03:06.570> still<00:03:06.780> okay<00:03:06.989> we're

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
notification is still okay we're

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.320 
notification is still okay we're
starting<00:03:07.440> this<00:03:07.560> on<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:07.800> two<00:03:07.950> all<00:03:08.310> right<00:03:11.330> okay

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
starting this on the two all right okay

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.550 
starting this on the two all right okay
so<00:03:12.360> that's<00:03:12.570> our<00:03:12.690> first<00:03:12.840> six<00:03:13.140> strokes<00:03:13.440> because

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
so that's our first six strokes because

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.800 
so that's our first six strokes because
this<00:03:13.769> is<00:03:13.890> sixteenth<00:03:14.340> note<00:03:14.489> triplets<00:03:15.120> okay<00:03:16.190> so

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
this is sixteenth note triplets okay so

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.560 
this is sixteenth note triplets okay so
now<00:03:18.810> that<00:03:18.870> we've<00:03:19.050> gone<00:03:19.200> over<00:03:19.260> that<00:03:19.769> if<00:03:20.570> you

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
now that we've gone over that if you

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.270 
now that we've gone over that if you
want<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.810> practice<00:03:22.019> just<00:03:22.530> getting<00:03:22.830> this<00:03:22.950> down

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
want to practice just getting this down

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.949 
want to practice just getting this down
starting<00:03:24.209> on<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:24.360> two<00:03:24.510> count

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
starting on the two count

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:41.920 
starting on the two count
try<00:03:25.769> this

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.710 

okay<00:03:42.930> try<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:43.920> see<00:03:44.550> if<00:03:44.670> it<00:03:44.790> helps<00:03:44.910> you<00:03:45.180> better

okay try that see if it helps you better
understand<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.380> timing<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:47.010> then<00:03:47.519> add<00:03:47.760> the

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
understand the timing and then add the

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.180 
understand the timing and then add the
fill<00:03:48.330> later<00:03:48.930> okay<00:03:49.290> so<00:03:49.709> now<00:03:49.860> that<00:03:49.980> everyone

fill later okay so now that everyone

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.770 
fill later okay so now that everyone
knows<00:03:50.310> where<00:03:50.700> our<00:03:50.819> timing<00:03:51.180> is<00:03:51.269> let<00:03:51.450> me<00:03:51.510> just<00:03:51.660> go

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
knows where our timing is let me just go

00:03:51.780 --> 00:04:08.390 
knows where our timing is let me just go
over<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.989> sticking<00:04:02.090> okay<00:04:03.090> a<00:04:04.040> double<00:04:07.400> and

have fun with it see if it works if it

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.020 
have fun with it see if it works if it
doesn't<00:05:04.410> use<00:05:05.410> it<00:05:05.530> just<00:05:05.590> practice<00:05:06.069> anyway<00:05:06.970> so

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
doesn't use it just practice anyway so

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.980 
doesn't use it just practice anyway so
