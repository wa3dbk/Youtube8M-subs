00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
going to dominate no matter what and

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.660 
going to dominate no matter what and
they<00:00:52.199> kind<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.530> had<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.800> be<00:00:52.949> hit<00:00:53.160> in<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.370> way<00:00:53.460> that

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
they kind of had to be hit in a way that

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.939 
they kind of had to be hit in a way that
plants<00:00:54.149> one<00:00:54.809> plant<00:00:55.079> had<00:00:55.320> their<00:00:55.500> dominating

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
plants one plant had their dominating

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.889 
plants one plant had their dominating
formats<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.699> even<00:00:57.300> though<00:00:57.420> they<00:00:57.600> were<00:00:57.660> hit

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
formats and even though they were hit

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.770 
formats and even though they were hit
once<00:00:58.170> or<00:00:58.530> even<00:00:58.559> twice<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:59.250> believe<00:00:59.280> actually

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
once or even twice I believe actually

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.840 
once or even twice I believe actually
they<00:01:00.780> kept<00:01:00.989> they<00:01:01.620> were<00:01:01.680> just<00:01:01.949> splashing<00:01:02.399> cards

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
they kept they were just splashing cards

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.850 
they kept they were just splashing cards
so<00:01:03.090> like<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.049> only<00:01:04.199> way<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.470> really<00:01:04.650> address

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
so like the only way to really address

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.390 
so like the only way to really address
it<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.460> nerf<00:01:05.850> them<00:01:06.119> beyond<00:01:06.630> belief<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.470> um<00:01:07.860> I

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
it is to nerf them beyond belief so um I

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.920 
it is to nerf them beyond belief so um I
don't<00:01:08.729> think<00:01:08.939> some<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.510> things<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.780> were

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
banned were necessary though considering

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.060 
banned were necessary though considering

things<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.049> think<00:02:01.200> might<00:02:01.560> stick<00:02:01.829> around<00:02:01.860> I

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
things that I think might stick around I

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.100 
things that I think might stick around I
actually<00:02:02.640> really<00:02:03.210> believe<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.600> on

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
actually really believe that on

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.870 
actually really believe that on
prophecies<00:02:04.740> weren't<00:02:05.130> really<00:02:05.369> hit<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.549> hard

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
prophecies weren't really hit that hard

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.089 
prophecies weren't really hit that hard
if<00:02:06.149> anything<00:02:06.899> on<00:02:07.170> blue-eyes<00:02:07.619> prophecy

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
if anything on blue-eyes prophecy

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.309 
if anything on blue-eyes prophecy
actually<00:02:08.489> might<00:02:08.610> be<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.789> thing<00:02:09.119> now<00:02:09.149> it's<00:02:09.989> going

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
actually might be a thing now it's going

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.839 
actually might be a thing now it's going
to<00:02:10.349> depend<00:02:10.770> on<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.400> speed<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.670> power<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.209> what

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
to depend on the speed and power of what

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.130 
to depend on the speed and power of what
the<00:02:12.939> other<00:02:13.120> met<00:02:13.390> the<00:02:13.540> decks<00:02:13.719> are<00:02:13.840> really<00:02:14.019> gonna

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
the other met the decks are really gonna

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.720 
the other met the decks are really gonna
be<00:02:14.319> like<00:02:14.560> I'm<00:02:14.709> not<00:02:14.890> really<00:02:15.040> sure<00:02:15.310> how<00:02:15.519> that

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
be like I'm not really sure how that

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.190 
be like I'm not really sure how that
boogy<00:02:16.090> matchup<00:02:16.390> is<00:02:16.450> gonna<00:02:16.510> be<00:02:16.719> between<00:02:16.900> that

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
boogy matchup is gonna be between that

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.869 
boogy matchup is gonna be between that
but<00:02:17.469> that<00:02:17.650> would<00:02:17.799> be<00:02:17.859> the<00:02:17.950> determining<00:02:18.430> factor

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
but that would be the determining factor

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.509 
but that would be the determining factor
