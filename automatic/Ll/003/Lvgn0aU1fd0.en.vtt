 raise all your hands to the sky 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:18.000

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.699
 welcome to this new video like 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.920
 see we are on j stars victory bs plus 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.199
 in practice an absurd game in which one is 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.300
 all the big ones will clash 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.279
 manga and anime characters 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.989
 so we can see against naruto later 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.260
 we will be able to see that the sofian the 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.390
 warrior against groups of one piece 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.250
 absurd stuff guys here there is but a 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.870
 I have a free battle already 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.700
 made one to understand a bit too 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.739
 how the game I can play works 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.090
 to assure that really really cool 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.660
 at the beginning a bit complicated by 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.399
 understand 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.469
 and above all they still have to 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.449
 unlock a brothel of characters there 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.489
 also the story mode from what I have 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.250
 understood and that boys will face it 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.800
 if you want together after completing 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.359
 batman arkham knight because I saw that 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.309
 now many of you want that series 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.990
 of batman for which the time will come now 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.520
 boy and we 're going to make a fight 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.510
 goku precisely against the dear naruto like 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.610
 friend guys go 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.830
 let's make that the choice is random then 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.810
 face naruto so girl let's go 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.909
 to make this clash more than it is epic 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.229
 there is something like this to see it 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.240
 put a little simpler otherwise 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.210
 I want to see something of this right away 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.150
 genre vegas is a dream for all 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.340
 lovers of anime manga e 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.170
 things like that 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.270
 then where we want to fight 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.340
 we fight at the leaf village but 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.530
 let's fight naruto at home 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.520
 so I would say we can proceed well 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.640
 so 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.619
 here begins the fight us maybe 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.360
 we should be a little stronger naruto is 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.729
 a little more weak then we aim at 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.280
 him and to beat him and hurt him 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.200
 I recommend you boy there if you want others 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.020
 this game now show you how the hell 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.180
 it's cool we exceed the 1500 I like but 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.600
 also the two thousand boys because I can 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.940
 ensure that with 50 characters you will see 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.860
 really absurd stuff of the whole 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.869
 character has his own supreme move 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.450
 really very very cool things 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.130
 for sure there will be at least one character 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.470
 that you know and that you have learned to 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.690
 to love in the anime of manga then 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.520
 boy there we are, there is a kind of 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.590
 presentation of all those who are i 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.540
 characters who will fight 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.519
 this clash there is also someone from 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.410
 bleach then I obviously don't know them 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.410
 everyone else I should know the 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.970
 minimum 50 manga and anime series what a little 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.910
 difficult then we have in the team 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.230
 wolves and then torino toriko I know him 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.330
 even if I did n't struggle in bed it is 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.850
 the soul ie I have not yet read the 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.650
 manga or me or he can assure you that 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.150
 fighting style is very different 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.519
 for example from between a brussels match 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.650
 both are fighting games but it is 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.590
 very very particular as a game 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.880
 look a little this is a move that 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.769
 allows him to make the attack of 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.110
 meteorites a move that was present 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.730
 even in old dragon ball games 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.130
 let us look at a series for a moment 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.560
 from them also I have to do a lot of 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.120
 practice with some keys and things of 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.190
 this type then I call from naruto 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.290
 guys we suffered with a beautiful one 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.000
 not even the only one able to do it changes 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.500
 But I'm taking blow come round 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.260
 goku here is the truck 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.910
 mammamia ragazzoni struck slut 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.200
 let's see if I can again 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.810
 reach the Russian look where 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.090
 we sent it in the distance just 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.030
 then we have a toki gene I don't have it 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.100
 caught trying again now it hurts 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.810
 the boys all the stuff that sees screen 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.820
 I don't understand it because they are mine 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.190
 first few clashes who knows how much stuff 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.520
 I 'm not understanding it at the moment it's only with 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.640
 a little bit planet 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:45.820
 I managed to understand a surprised 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.070
 bad blow for less than sixteen 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.160
 guys then watch how they move 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.120
 sin however hit watch a movie 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.460
 which has not combined 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.320
 obviously everyone calls him where he wants 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.450
 there are also those who call it rags then 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.710
 obviously this is also about 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.710
 habit 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.270
 mammamia, big boys, I have to try 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.430
 to do that powerful show 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.710

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.200

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.060

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:25.990
 I'm doing it is what it is 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.480
 this stuff wasn't the star or 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.910
 on the other, everyone got pissed off 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.890
 this is a supreme attack then with 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.530
 the supreme attack a sphere that gave him 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:38.920
 the boy them my wasted by ma 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:43.000

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.360

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.520
 understood he believes we still do another 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.610
 pole is very close for sure 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.320
 we will destroy go hit hopes the 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.430
 kid loved to raise all his hands to the 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.420

 number of the magician but I know I haven't yet 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.350
 own bed for the time I have to be 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.230
 careful why 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:27.440
 beat me pity someone knows me not 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:29.720
 then hit pro damn raga me 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.910

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.570
 naruto the technique of multiplication 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.870
 of the body then go with a meat to me 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:41.000
 I have to be careful with nothing guys 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.920
 because if they catch you I'm finished it's like 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.570
 I will go to my room and I still have to understand 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.080
 based on what we can do ours 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.690
 moves 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.000
 the last life warning spy hurt 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.830
 then only the toti gene remains 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.570
 I have to see if I can try 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.980
 turn them into super sayan what I have 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.000
 done 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.430
 maybe my character who has 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.860
 grossed a little are obviously more 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.720
 powerful something like this inflated ho 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.460
 also called toriko because guys in 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.620
 practice this is a clash two were 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.960
 two to which one can also add 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.910
 my mom i 'm taking times you can 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.880
 also add third characters that 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.950
 but it is a support so it helps us 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.140
 hit and then won league with 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.720
 this canea me up completely 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:24.230
 destroyed my opponent 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:26.360
 now then tell me if this game is there 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.880
 like it or not girl because it seems to me 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.800
 absurd that now I did not know the keys do not 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.500
 I knew nothing but still I have 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.120
 I really enjoyed a bang 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.890
 exceptional if you want more videos then 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.050
 su j stars victory if you want us to 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.610
 then let's do the adventure together later 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.140
 having obviously concluded before batman 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.790
 arkham line that if you want more fights 

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.980
 like this with all the characters from 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.780
 one piece dragon ball toriko and all the 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.090

 Hello
