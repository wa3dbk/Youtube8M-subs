00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:08.670
 Hello everyone, finally I 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:11.730
 finished doing sharpeners yesterday i laid out 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:17.400
 video probably already some of you 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:23.779
 have seen what is very general 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.779
 laborious process many small parts 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:34.070
 such as joint but in general, all fully 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.070
 the design requires special attention 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:41.219
 These stainless steel plates worked 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:48.890
 with a stainless steel here knows that 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:48.890
 it is processed very badly by cutting 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.680
 tips 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:07.400
 I slightly changed the shape turned out 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:12.110
 such fungi first made round balls 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:18.950
 and then it was more convenient for me 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:24.009
 these sharpeners seem smaller than that 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.009
 sharpener which I did the first time 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:51.590
 Platform length 250 millimeters width 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:54.280
 sharpeners 7 at one hundred seventy three 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.280
 millimeter 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:02.140
 stop plate width of 65 millimeters and 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.790
 long 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.300
 87 88 millimeters 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:29.980
 mean by the hinge materials from 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:34.319
 caprolon holders from caprolon in front 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.319
 stainless steel adapter sleeves 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:45.840
 plywood base of such 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:58.930
 she is resistant plywood means alder kerchief 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.519
 the front part which is pressed 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.519
 bearing too alder and 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:08.310
 worktop made of oak 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:18.480
 bearing for extruded one his quite 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.480
 enough 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:33.560
 and ridge made of ebonite 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:49.410
 I do not have a lathe but still 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:52.280
 I managed them to make these sticky sharpened 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.280
 on the drilling machine 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:05.690
 I also don't have a milling machine, but 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.690
 hinges i can do too 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:21.230
 as I said work is great and even 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:21.230
 sometimes you don't want to sell for money 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:31.430
 I'd love can be presented 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.430
 someone from your friends and acquaintances 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:49.830
 Aluminum blank by the way who needs 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:55.980
 blanks i found an aluminum plate of three 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:05:00.000
 millimeters there somewhere around 15 pieces i 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:02.420
 I think you need to do something interested 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.420
 lichku 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.990
