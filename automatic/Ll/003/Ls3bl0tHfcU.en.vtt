00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
very much and I'd like to make a

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.790 
very much and I'd like to make a
disclaimer<00:02:38.800> that<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:40.450> do<00:02:40.720> everyone<00:02:41.320> smile

which<00:02:42.040> is<00:02:42.250> I<00:02:42.280> don't<00:02:42.640> consider<00:02:42.970> myself<00:02:43.120> to<00:02:43.630> be

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
which is I don't consider myself to be

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.380 
which is I don't consider myself to be
particularly<00:02:44.200> good<00:02:44.680> i<00:02:44.980> hope<00:02:45.760> i<00:02:45.910> never<00:02:45.940> come

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
particularly good i hope i never come

across<00:02:46.510> as<00:02:47.670> preachy<00:02:48.670> or<00:02:48.700> high<00:02:49.150> or<00:02:49.180> Z<00:02:49.720> I<00:02:50.040> don't

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
across as preachy or high or Z I don't

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.840 
across as preachy or high or Z I don't
think<00:02:51.190> that's<00:02:51.340> a<00:02:51.489> real<00:02:51.670> thing<00:02:51.700> alright<00:02:52.450> anyway

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
think that's a real thing alright anyway

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.430 
think that's a real thing alright anyway
because<00:02:54.850> I<00:02:55.030> can't<00:02:55.269> possibly<00:02:55.780> be<00:02:55.989> right<00:02:56.200> all

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
because I can't possibly be right all

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.100 
because I can't possibly be right all
the<00:02:56.470> time<00:02:56.790> in<00:02:57.790> fact<00:02:57.970> I'm<00:02:58.150> probably<00:02:58.420> not<00:02:58.840> right

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
the time in fact I'm probably not right

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.199 
the time in fact I'm probably not right
very<00:02:59.470> much<00:02:59.709> at<00:02:59.980> all<00:03:00.180> all<00:03:01.180> right<00:03:01.709> website<00:03:02.709> I

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
very much at all all right website I

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.620 
very much at all all right website I
have<00:03:04.209> some<00:03:04.959> plans<00:03:05.290> being<00:03:05.860> laid<00:03:06.190> to<00:03:06.600> create<00:03:07.600> a

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
have some plans being laid to create a

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.780 
have some plans being laid to create a
website<00:03:07.959> that<00:03:08.590> will<00:03:09.540> help<00:03:10.540> me<00:03:11.350> get<00:03:11.980> people

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
website that will help me get people

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.949 
website that will help me get people
through<00:03:13.570> sort<00:03:13.870> of<00:03:13.989> the<00:03:15.330> project<00:03:16.330> setting<00:03:16.810> up

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
through sort of the project setting up

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.020 
through sort of the project setting up
process<00:03:17.709> and<00:03:18.010> I've<00:03:18.459> got<00:03:18.610> some<00:03:18.790> great<00:03:18.910> ideas

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
process and I've got some great ideas

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.870 
process and I've got some great ideas
but<00:03:19.660> I<00:03:20.049> do<00:03:20.170> believe<00:03:20.620> it's<00:03:21.190> a<00:03:21.370> website<00:03:21.850> that

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
but I do believe it's a website that

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.660 
but I do believe it's a website that
will<00:03:22.120> be<00:03:22.269> fairly<00:03:22.630> complicated<00:03:23.410> to<00:03:23.860> execute<00:03:24.489> on

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
will be fairly complicated to execute on

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.270 
will be fairly complicated to execute on
the<00:03:25.090> programming<00:03:25.900> and<00:03:26.310> so<00:03:27.310> what<00:03:28.209> I<00:03:28.239> need<00:03:28.630> is<00:03:29.280> a

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
the programming and so what I need is a

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.020 
the programming and so what I need is a
very<00:03:31.239> talented<00:03:31.510> code<00:03:32.140> monkey<00:03:32.830> who<00:03:33.700> will

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
very talented code monkey who will

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.090 
very talented code monkey who will
that's<00:03:34.810> a<00:03:34.930> compliment<00:03:35.380> right<00:03:35.530> in<00:03:35.799> the<00:03:35.890> code

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
that's a compliment right in the code

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.010 
that's a compliment right in the code

you've<00:04:03.030> done<00:04:03.210> before<00:04:03.960> and<00:04:04.470> see<00:04:04.740> that<00:04:05.160> way<00:04:05.280> I

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
you've done before and see that way I

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.170 
you've done before and see that way I
kind<00:04:05.580> of<00:04:05.730> gauge<00:04:06.330> up<00:04:06.720> front<00:04:07.140> if<00:04:07.350> you<00:04:08.070> have<00:04:08.730> sort

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
kind of gauge up front if you have sort

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.650 
kind of gauge up front if you have sort
of<00:04:09.300> the<00:04:09.900> track<00:04:10.260> record<00:04:10.770> to<00:04:11.000> you<00:04:12.000> know<00:04:12.120> do<00:04:12.420> what

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
of the track record to you know do what

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.840 
of the track record to you know do what
it<00:04:12.870> is<00:04:13.020> I'm<00:04:13.260> looking<00:04:13.380> for<00:04:13.710> another<00:04:14.070> house<00:04:14.520> to

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
it is I'm looking for another house to

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.220 
it is I'm looking for another house to
express<00:04:15.180> that<00:04:15.680> so<00:04:16.680> I<00:04:17.459> think<00:04:17.610> yeah<00:04:18.570> that's<00:04:18.810> it<00:04:18.989> a

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
express that so I think yeah that's it a

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.600 
express that so I think yeah that's it a
lot<00:04:19.560> shorter<00:04:19.950> this<00:04:20.040> time<00:04:20.100> why<00:04:20.310> don't<00:04:20.370> we<00:04:20.520> add

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.610 
lot shorter this time why don't we add

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.950 
lot shorter this time why don't we add
