00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:07.980
 Welcome and forget about yourself Construction 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.299
 discuss with 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:12.789
 she will not go on strike 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:15.789
 the bomb is supposed to be better with one 

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:19.930
 The content is then packed again separately 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.240
 these are the components scenes slide or again with styrofoam guns of 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.390
 well-known protection Otmar feat the instruction manual 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.290
 the one and the components are with numbers and letters that see the 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.910
 you will then find again in the manual 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.950
 so the simple structure 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.950
 in 45 minutes is possible 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.310
 First write the round feet on the lower parts of the table legs 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.390
 there are also later uneven floors easily compensated 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.210
 can 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.500
 Dark voice has the locke you can join the unification market 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.430
 in or out 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.610
 Next, they are the ones who are pinning the connections and jumping into the depths 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.300
 sign this 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.300
 with the song provided screws 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.300
 a matching decision will pull and harsh sentence 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.950
 in the next assembly step they see the merger of the two 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.970
 Table legs and the fixing center determines screw 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.710
 the festes write there serves zoo to adjust the table later in the height 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.430
 Now the Rheinau 8 can do the remaining cross struts with the legs 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.190
 be screwed 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.120
 Now if you have assembled all cross braces with them 4 with the assembly of the 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.520
 Oste fittings 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.500
 These Lindau Zod's desk will later disguise the tilt 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.990
 can 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.370
 pay special attention to the fact that the payment is still at the top 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.369
 otherwise a later adjustment is not possible 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.840
 After assembling the Oste hardware we start with the preparation 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.780
 Tauberts worked 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.229
 on the worktop four benches are screwed which later become a fixture 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.229
 the worktop and also allow the inclination 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.840
 For attaching the angles for the grid fitting you need one 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.270
 Cross screwdriver not included 

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:18.839
 the two cards for the pins ice-t are simply plugged in and out 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:21.089
 then pushed to the worktop 

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:24.469
 These will then be ticked with a screw on the currently there 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:29.180
 if they have all parts of the countertop mounted they can do this on the 

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:32.179
 Understand of the desk life 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:36.649
 first write the countertop with the underlay and 

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:39.649
 Torture in Tripoli 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.859
 Now you can easily fold the worktop up and the 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.859
 Mount rust fittings 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.999
 if the grids were damaged the Conti could now have the 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:54.999
 Adjust the inclination of the table 

00:02:58.059 --> 00:03:01.980
 the construction of our desk is now complete to mention that 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:04.979
 This desk is also available in other colors 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:14.689
