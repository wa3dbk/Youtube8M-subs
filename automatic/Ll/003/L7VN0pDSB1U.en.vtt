the<00:00:56.039> best<00:00:56.190> way<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.399> find<00:00:56.820> they<00:00:57.000> deal<00:00:57.420> with<00:00:57.480> them

the best way I find they deal with them

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.930 
the best way I find they deal with them
is<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.079> just<00:00:58.230> constantly<00:00:58.739> spin<00:00:59.039> kick<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.820> if

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
is it just constantly spin kick so if

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.250 
is it just constantly spin kick so if
