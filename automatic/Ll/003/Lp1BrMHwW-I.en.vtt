00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.370 
tripod is different that one is in you
can<00:03:40.710> see<00:03:40.920> here<00:03:41.100> this<00:03:41.340> one<00:03:41.550> is<00:03:41.580> a<00:03:41.700> plastic<00:03:42.240> and

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
can see here this one is a plastic and

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.680 
can see here this one is a plastic and
this<00:03:43.380> one<00:03:43.620> is<00:03:43.800> actually<00:03:44.190> like<00:03:44.550> a<00:03:44.580> belt<00:03:44.910> like<00:03:45.630> a
