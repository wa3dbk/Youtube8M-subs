00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:05.200
 how to maintain a gigantic telescope in voting your daughter 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.190
 in 1930 this was the challenge encountered by engineers who built a 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.190
 Telescope the Yoga in Mount a Californian 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.880
 in this position 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.880
 in this case the examination 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:26.860
 to rotate 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.980
 the horseshoe-shaped object should literally float in the harbor of your 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.980
 curvilinear structure 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.860
 then it will be released 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.700
 I do the local coverage nothing to see 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.940
 There are people studying the goals for angela the biggest slice 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.720
 only kaita kicked hard by hitting the hand 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.490
 Attempts caps being studied 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.170
 only the guardianship still 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.590
 of this total 70 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.590
 this concentration 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.930
 As the bombs sent the warriors continually scratched in the 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.810
 160 pounds per square inch back to obama 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.050
 - the dogs 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.080
 as I am 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.370
 we have that is so rare in history 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.490
 the text explains the commander 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.490
 if you accept the teaching cent before the 13th 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.640
 recently the pigeon observatory was left with the oil eye by the 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.640
 synthetic due to the lower flammability 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.030
 the synthetic also surpasses the petroleum in other points 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.829
 and one of the first to be observed was the commercial interest at the beginning of the 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.829
 20th century 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.960
 that night they indicated that they are returning to the 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.490
 all other schools or homes comment in the center of the capital of São Paulo to the principal 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.740
 internal and confident 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.200
 these amounts are expensive 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.859
 the angop that sustains a great hit to the force of the Palestinian band 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.050
 What a good political performance do not ask do not tell anyone 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.289
 presentations 

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:15.499
 the process consists in making artificial hydrocarbons from the 

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:19.479
 charcoal but it is possible to produce synthetic lubricant 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:21.639
 Petroleum 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:24.429
 and sand syndicate 

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:29.359
 pass legolas are made in the laboratory with the breaking of components 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:34.099
 reconstruction to obtain a uniform result for the mother on the floor if 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.599
 paid and in this age bracket can occur 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.589
 this kind of political pressure or even the motive to complain 

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:45.949
 the disaster like that only when you have your turn have until the end of pantyhose 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:51.539
 was missed after threats if he has to lose and in the last round because 

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:56.829
 believes that they are lacking only if there are therapies or offensive 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:00.089
 index to happen again 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:03.789
 on the other hand, conventional lubricants made from crude oil 

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:08.719
 I counted undesirable molecules in the country oar not only on the politics of 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:12.089
 death or intervention giving little the next day 

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:15.239
 joel santana or double the previous year 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.089
 in two days 

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:23.009
 the imperfect molecules of the petroleum bind the molecules of oxygen and 

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:24.530
 cause oxidation 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.989
 damaging lubricant 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.269
 but in Germany in the 1930s the major problem will be the lack of 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.269
 Petroleum 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.159
 at the time when he lived and took Poland the Germans produced the 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:46.330
 Synthetic lubricant for your military vehicles 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.070
 American biologists began to manufacture or for their bombers 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:58.309
 but it was the post-war creation of a new jet plane that drove the 

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:01.309
 development of synthetic lubricant 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:06.690
 the patio several weeks 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.860
 Andy walked the big ones so although of the life said hoyama its local vein 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.740
 pare had poor performance of the forensic mother had goal of the 70's only 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.580
 there is the status of collection in Sudan and Libya for this year at 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.580
 remains dry of the Viking area of ​​coverage 

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:27.069
 the hack a day site gm indicates north of the region between netherrealm 

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:31.829
 all we want is the theme in Rio de Janeiro before 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.419
 most have already performed at higher altitudes than the plane sighted 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.719
 where the atmospheric pressure is lower 

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:42.719
 and causes the oil lubricant to evaporate 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.650
 the market eagerly awaits the auditions 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.010
 he also announced that the cuts should go to the bathroom or missed 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.990
 also creates a search the way to inform 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.780
 but it was to the benefits of cold weather inspired with one of the visionaries who 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.780
 have brought the lubricant to the 

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:14.119
 in the 60's the lieutenant-colonel and jet pilot the work that is a cross ioc did 

00:05:14.119 --> 00:05:17.300
 experiments with synthetic oil after use in turbines 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.650
 thurston still in recourse to Russian weapons khomyakova melzer aut in reports 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.650
 sending this network extra business Corsican be curious the history of components - 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.569
 santa 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:33.559
 the result was positive 

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:37.860
 he continued the research worked with several chemical companies 

00:05:37.859 --> 00:05:40.859
 and made history in the motor oil industry 

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:48.379
 in 1962 its product became the first 100% synthetic oil to be 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:51.379
 approved by the American Petroleum Institute 

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:56.680
 synthetic motor oil is best in winter 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.290
 why it is not influenced by harmful petroleum chemistry 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:07.580
 with these colorados certainly some other larger jaguar box collection in the 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.259
 Internet 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:11.259
 the anac will make its world cup debut 

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:16.979
 in low temperatures the paraffin endurence pio obstruct the oil flow
