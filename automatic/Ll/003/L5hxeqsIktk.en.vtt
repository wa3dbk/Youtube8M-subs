00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello everyone here gabri under all 90 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.340
 and killer hello everyone here we are with a 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.889
 new video this time on the cards 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.740
 I am not an expert on the subject I will make you 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:19.410
 see how the cards are mixed into 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:21.960
 various ways I learned from the movie by 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.760
 Terence Hill and Bud Spencer is a bit 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.119
 strange thing is that he hasn't seen it 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.660
 with some youtube tutorials but 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:36.149
 let's forget about this a bit 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:39.780
 it is called elastic 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:43.620
 cards so then take it slowly here 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:52.520
 they revolted many we did of 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:56.969
 review a little faster and one later 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:01:01.109
 this one here that I don't know how 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.600
 he calls but they take the cards here with 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.770
 these fingers are held so that 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.799
 they go up like stairs to remove or like 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.869
 of the stairs to the top 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:18.650
 so it is more convenient to let the 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:21.840
 card here where both veino here 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:29.060
 Valais put a little bit like that 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.060
 to the company so at 0 here is so at 0 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:39.490
 then and then you go like this 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:46.509
 and then goes to the center of the paper 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:53.649
 however if with the dg 15 and from a card for 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:55.799
 time and they almost mix like this 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:02:01.289
 this position can make the bridge 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:06.429
 that is, take the cards so-so 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:10.360
 get left out of this a little more 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:16.470
 complicated that is not so complicated 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:30.670
 but then let them see this bridge 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:33.489
 then anonymous now this plastic model and this one 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:40.420
 the bridge is one thing that is true 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:42.430
 me ok then there is the way to mix there 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.610
 the way to always mix was the 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.610
 itself 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:53.859
 always in the same way so only that 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:58.560
 for air ok and you do it by taking these two 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:03:01.480
 fingers which these three fingers or two 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.780
 depending on how comfortable you are at least 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.430
 I think I put it this way 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.450
 read the cards 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:14.019
 this one the index fingers folded the thumbs 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:18.450
 that act as support and see if there 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.450
 they manage easy facades if you do so 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.630
 here is precisely 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:34.790
 oh well so all in all it's the same 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:39.890
 what doing only in the area that it did succeeded 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.890
 on the ground you do it in the air you do so 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:48.060
 instead see it a little bit 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:51.390
 because my name is ok the video of today is 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.420
 finished was unite in practice here was not 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:57.989
 nothing that was a little tutorial e 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.640
