00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.820
 hello friends today extreme racing and this 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.340
 it's a race that I liked a lot 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.209
 It has an average degree of difficulty 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.030
 because let's say that what you grab on 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:18.000
 the way to enter the corkscrew that 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.830
 it's like one with some new careers 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.539
 who are taking out the gringos and then 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.789
 They are very interesting and I like them 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.949
 too much and so they have been baptized 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.589
 corkscrew especially is for the 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.359
 spirals can also be spiral 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:32.340
 of candles could baptize as a type 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.350
 spiral although clear nothing else is a 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.170
 part of the spiral is not a spiral like that 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.330
 as with 300 laps here we are already with 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.270
 all friends are going to participate and 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:45.180
 Well let's see how we are doing in this 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.790
 career let's start with entities 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.250
 nothing more entities or entities without 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.350
 modify there is no more the only thing that 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.740
 we can choose is the color of 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.160
 car and then it runs with a lot 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.989
 lucky because I'm giving birth first 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.510
 let's see if we can keep this 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.150
 first place that I see it very very difficult 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.030
 We are running 10 people we are 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.330
 nine people comes next the bullets 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.700
 done well then robots shot 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.040
 look for and control good control control 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.600
 and then acceleration thoroughly and let's go 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.190
 to the other side of the bridge 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.970
 this is the corkscrew that 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.520
 I mentioned do not go drowning 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.790
 reversal reversal that does not come from today 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.070
 of good did not drown that is good that no 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.869
 has drowned though of makanza 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.950
 a person and we have a new one still 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.229
 first let's go to the ramp to 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.810
 enter this path a path of 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.810
 land 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.860
 Huancayo Cold Compound That I Myself 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.180
 but that I more or less decomposed 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.759
 because also that there more or less 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.590
 decomposed and we already reincorporated the 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:58.299
 but yes yes 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:03.219
 and dawn that in this one he won in this 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:04.810
 called the cortez no cuts of land is 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:06.579
 that then against the ropes sometimes to 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.349
 the strangers' and sometimes do not use by the 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.090
 gas flour when yes when it is not 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.660
 difficult but already at night I'm going to 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.860
 learn that new I will contribute 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.100
 In a second 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.210
 not the mafia the water and I went to wash and 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.860
 here comes in as for a little more than 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.380
 speed to achieve a good 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.240
 trajectory and with that get into 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.790
 corkscrew and already take out all the 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.620
 corkscrew and do not come turn and let's go 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.810
 that was fine acceleration thoroughly 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.050
 to time of formula defense and my 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.160
 partner of a defense before I do not 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.800
 I'll put in that defense that they left there 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.360
 good angel first came see first 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.720
 being the first to see what stops 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.970
 this was left behind, not if I already 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.520
 first or go back we will see if 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.430
 I can keep this rhythm jala jala jala 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.130
 slow client behave not jump 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.870
 do not do anything strange to sell then 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.570
 some of the most reliable jumps do not 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.520
 do nothing strange come let's go for the 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.970
 second round and the first one he achieved in 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:06.730
 first place we go for the second and 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.530
 my friends are still waiting to pass 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.530
 the first corkscrew I still think 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.920
 this turn 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.680
 two 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.659
 what's on the bridge 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.590
 while on the bridge to make a 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:28.989
 disappear this is cheating we have to 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.060
 fall to the other side we have to fall 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.819
 to the other side without getting off the 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.239
 how much then new hand again the 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.709
 story and I already went sideways we have already 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.109
 released here you have to enter as with 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.760
 an approximate speed you do not have to 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.200
 hit both on the wall because when 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.480
 you play a lot on the wall like you 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.189
 stop and you can not make the turn and 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.109
 enter with a clean path here 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:51.790
 I already made the turn I made the 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:54.099
 clean trajectory and we go to the other 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.489
 side of the bridge and this of unmade 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.489
 trap 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:04.400
 comrades we are here we go in second 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:07.159
 place that has it the first place and I 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.769
 I put a lot to the left and I've already lost 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:10.909
 a few thousandths to a few tenths of a 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.159
 second 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:15.680
 We also are worth is forward through 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:17.239
 our partner let's go let's see if 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.970
 we will reach it and in the first place 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.820
 I'm in second left left 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.699
 and the next one is already uncut 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.440
 cut that I'm not going to contribute and I do 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:30.260
 I'm going to open a little more if I'm not going 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.000
 to carry is already without grip and what 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.580
 is the earth because then one skids 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.010
 and it stays there it loses a time and it does not 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.380
 can do well the race when we already 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.940
 with the last one this is the last serve 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.240
 because we're going to see why doing it 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.370
 first no no no no I lost a lot 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.229
 speed there and already with the test of 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.360
 speed like that does not reach to be good 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.320
 the trajectory but also my friend my 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.510
 friend lost it take good 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.190
 this if I do it in Benghazi it is called and it 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.360
 see that they slow down the 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.780
 in-depth acceleration 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:03.330
 and also my friend came up I can 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.289
 reach you can not reach it and sometimes 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.820
 very decomposed down 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:11.810
 have where it goes to where they come down from the bar 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.689
 they were already roads I do not think to think it 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:17.019
 let's see let's see it 

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:18.999
 I will not reach them and nothing else is a 

00:05:17.019 --> 00:05:20.169
 turn left a return and put the 

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:23.589
 goal 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:26.079
 lips no no longer reached it with turbo 

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:29.159
 nor when and troya 

00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:31.989
 they should accumulate good good run 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:33.879
 good career and they want second neither 

00:05:31.989 --> 00:05:35.169
 so let's see here the rest of 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:38.019
 our friends are going to give you 10 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:39.909
 seconds and those who finish who 

00:05:38.019 --> 00:05:42.000
 end here is finishing one more 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:44.680
 can zero 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.330
 and the race is over 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.850
 let's see how we are staying in 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.430
 second place I first of all have 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:54.729
 that blocked fermex and let's see how much 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:57.220
 they gave us they gave us 9000 of money 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:06:00.220
 Welcome 4 sales then replenish 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.110
 well very welcome and let's see the 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.910
 Leaderboard how it was not without 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:11.540
 before seeing the celebration of the sick 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:13.490
 fernet let's see the the table of 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.740
 positions as we were in first place 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.320
 it was fermented in second place I stayed 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:22.490
 in the third one was angel fourth with 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:25.070
 fifth pec and hits 0 sixth with seventh 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:28.840
 and they go in 8 and in 9, so good 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.840
 friends this was extreme racing goodbye
