00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
the bottom like pretty much in terms of

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.680 
the bottom like pretty much in terms of

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
old foamposites as far as they go I

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.330 
old foamposites as far as they go I
could<00:03:47.020> pretty<00:03:47.140> much<00:03:47.230> say<00:03:47.590> that<00:03:47.830> it<00:03:48.040> doesn't

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
could pretty much say that it doesn't

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.240 
could pretty much say that it doesn't
have<00:03:48.489> any<00:03:48.730> bubbling<00:03:49.300> but<00:03:49.540> it<00:03:50.440> does<00:03:50.770> a<00:03:50.800> little

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
have any bubbling but it does a little

have any bubbling but it does a little
bit<00:03:51.459> so<00:03:51.900> it's<00:03:52.900> kind<00:03:53.080> of<00:03:53.140> hard<00:03:53.200> for<00:03:53.470> you<00:03:53.620> guys<00:03:53.800> to

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
bit so it's kind of hard for you guys to

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:00.060 
bit so it's kind of hard for you guys to
see<00:03:54.900> this<00:03:55.900> one's<00:03:56.310> pretty<00:03:57.310> good<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:59.620> then<00:03:59.860> this

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.800 
anything so everyone's coming with those
new<00:05:11.460> foamposites<00:05:14.060> these<00:05:15.060> are<00:05:15.240> the<00:05:15.300> ones<00:05:15.539> right

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
new foamposites these are the ones right

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:24.620 
new foamposites these are the ones right
here<00:05:15.840> so<00:05:19.009> size<00:05:20.009> 12<00:05:22.340> 2006<00:05:23.340> release<00:05:23.759> this<00:05:24.479> is<00:05:24.570> the

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
here so size 12 2006 release this is the

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.120 
here so size 12 2006 release this is the
only<00:05:24.750> time<00:05:25.020> they<00:05:25.229> came<00:05:25.409> out<00:05:25.590> in<00:05:25.770> this<00:05:25.860> color

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
only time they came out in this color

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.290 
only time they came out in this color
check<00:05:26.759> them<00:05:26.940> out<00:05:27.030> online<00:05:27.389> the<00:05:27.900> doctor<00:05:28.259> doom's

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
check them out online the doctor doom's

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.499 
check them out online the doctor doom's
they're<00:05:30.300> going<00:05:30.599> for<00:05:30.780> like<00:05:30.870> 300<00:05:31.590> use<00:05:31.830> at<00:05:32.220> least

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:32.509 
they're going for like 300 use at least

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:35.749 
they're going for like 300 use at least
so<00:05:33.509> the<00:05:33.960> bigger<00:05:34.199> sizes<00:05:34.500> are<00:05:34.830> hard<00:05:35.009> to<00:05:35.159> find<00:05:35.190> you

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 
so the bigger sizes are hard to find you

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:37.370 
so the bigger sizes are hard to find you
know<00:05:35.880> you<00:05:35.940> can<00:05:36.180> find<00:05:36.389> the<00:05:36.479> galaxies<00:05:37.050> and<00:05:37.259> all

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
know you can find the galaxies and all

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.439 
know you can find the galaxies and all
the<00:05:37.530> newer<00:05:37.770> style<00:05:38.159> foamposites<00:05:38.880> a<00:05:38.970> lot<00:05:39.180> easier

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:39.449 
the newer style foamposites a lot easier

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:42.110 
the newer style foamposites a lot easier
than<00:05:39.659> these<00:05:39.960> ones<00:05:40.580> there's<00:05:41.580> probably<00:05:41.669> only<00:05:41.970> a

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
than these ones there's probably only a

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.270 
than these ones there's probably only a
couple<00:05:42.180> pairs<00:05:42.750> of<00:05:43.020> these<00:05:43.110> on<00:05:43.380> ebay<00:05:43.770> at<00:05:43.830> a<00:05:43.979> time

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
couple pairs of these on ebay at a time

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.399 
couple pairs of these on ebay at a time
so<00:05:44.789> and<00:05:45.300> they're<00:05:45.960> scattered<00:05:46.530> in<00:05:46.680> sizes<00:05:47.310> so

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:48.409 
so and they're scattered in sizes so

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:54.499 
so and they're scattered in sizes so
here<00:05:49.409> they<00:05:49.620> are<00:05:49.650> size<00:05:50.520> 12<00:05:52.849> authentic<00:05:53.849> one

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:54.509 
here they are size 12 authentic one

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:57.230 
here they are size 12 authentic one
