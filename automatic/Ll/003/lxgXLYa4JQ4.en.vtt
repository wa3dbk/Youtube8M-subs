it's going to pull you back now you're

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.279 
it's going to pull you back now you're
looking<00:01:00.760> at<00:01:01.059> it<00:01:01.210> and<00:01:01.269> it's<00:01:01.390> a<00:01:01.479> sports<00:01:01.870> style

but<00:01:02.499> it's<00:01:02.620> a<00:01:02.649> little<00:01:02.739> bit<00:01:02.859> bigger<00:01:03.219> than<00:01:03.399> your

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
but it's a little bit bigger than your

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.600 
but it's a little bit bigger than your

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
utility sport styling what that means is

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.750 
utility sport styling what that means is
you've<00:01:11.500> got<00:01:11.620> all<00:01:11.740> the<00:01:11.860> elegant<00:01:12.190> lugs<00:01:12.490> of<00:01:12.670> a

you<00:01:48.730> got<00:01:48.880> a<00:01:48.910> really<00:01:49.120> fight<00:01:49.450> with<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.720> steering

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
you got a really fight with the steering

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.560 
you got a really fight with the steering
they<00:01:51.100> thought<00:01:51.370> about<00:01:51.610> that<00:01:51.850> too<00:01:52.090> this<00:01:52.300> has<00:01:52.330> got

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
they thought about that too this has got

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.570 
they thought about that too this has got
a<00:01:52.600> DPS<00:01:53.140> system<00:01:53.470> it's<00:01:53.590> a<00:01:53.680> dynamic<00:01:54.310> power

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
a DPS system it's a dynamic power

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.730 
a DPS system it's a dynamic power
steering<00:01:55.300> system<00:01:55.750> to<00:01:55.930> it<00:01:56.080> which<00:01:56.560> is

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
steering system to it which is

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.500 
steering system to it which is
adjustable<00:01:57.280> you<00:01:57.490> can<00:01:57.640> actually<00:01:57.790> adjust<00:01:58.060> it<00:01:58.420> on

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
adjustable you can actually adjust it on

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.350 
adjustable you can actually adjust it on
the<00:01:58.570> fly<00:01:58.860> for<00:01:59.860> how<00:02:00.070> much<00:02:00.310> resistance<00:02:00.700> you<00:02:01.060> want

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
the fly for how much resistance you want

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.020 
the fly for how much resistance you want
and<00:02:01.600> how<00:02:02.200> much<00:02:02.380> assistance<00:02:02.800> you<00:02:03.160> want<00:02:03.370> it's

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
and how much assistance you want it's

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.450 
and how much assistance you want it's
really<00:02:04.150> a<00:02:04.540> great<00:02:04.900> system<00:02:05.470> and<00:02:05.620> yet<00:02:06.190> again<00:02:06.430> I

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
really a great system and yet again I

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.070 
really a great system and yet again I
mean<00:02:06.610> there's<00:02:06.910> just<00:02:06.970> so<00:02:07.270> many<00:02:07.570> innovations

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
mean there's just so many innovations

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.080 
mean there's just so many innovations
about<00:02:08.500> this<00:02:08.649> one<00:02:08.890> of<00:02:08.979> my<00:02:09.039> favorite<00:02:09.399> aspects<00:02:09.879> on

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
about this one of my favorite aspects on

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.729 
about this one of my favorite aspects on
it<00:02:10.209> is<00:02:10.300> the<00:02:10.420> rear<00:02:10.629> end<00:02:10.869> but<00:02:11.409> you<00:02:11.500> know<00:02:11.590> me<00:02:11.709> I

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
it is the rear end but you know me I

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.350 
it is the rear end but you know me I
like<00:02:11.890> to<00:02:12.010> point<00:02:12.129> out<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.370> rear<00:02:12.519> end<00:02:12.700> this<00:02:13.209> is

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
like to point out the rear end this is

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.000 
like to point out the rear end this is
what<00:02:13.480> they<00:02:13.569> call<00:02:13.690> a<00:02:13.750> TTI<00:02:14.200> rear<00:02:14.590> end<00:02:14.800> it's<00:02:14.980> a

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
what they call a TTI rear end it's a

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.640 
what they call a TTI rear end it's a
true<00:02:15.340> track<00:02:15.790> independent<00:02:16.780> suspension<00:02:17.290> system

true track independent suspension system

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.290 
true track independent suspension system
normally<00:02:18.340> on<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:18.489> independent<00:02:18.970> you<00:02:19.030> see<00:02:19.209> the

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
normally on the independent you see the

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.180 
normally on the independent you see the
dual<00:02:19.480> a-arm<00:02:19.870> system<00:02:20.230> that<00:02:20.349> comes<00:02:20.590> out<00:02:20.830> and<00:02:21.040> you

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
dual a-arm system that comes out and you

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.830 
dual a-arm system that comes out and you
know<00:02:21.280> whatever<00:02:21.459> you<00:02:21.670> go<00:02:21.849> up<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:22.180> down<00:02:22.269> it's

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
know whatever you go up and down it's

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.390 
know whatever you go up and down it's
got<00:02:23.020> what<00:02:23.140> they<00:02:23.200> call<00:02:23.319> a<00:02:23.380> butterfly<00:02:23.890> motion

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400
