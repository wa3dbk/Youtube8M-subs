00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.319
 hello guys with you eggplant 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.500
 doubly for chickens today April 1st and 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.530
 wargaming came up 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.270
 something so incredibly new feature 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.150
 for one day she is respectively only 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:19.630
 today is such a suitcase 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:22.740
 secret weapon as they call it on 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.779
 buttons all here it is not called 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.070
 arteriole horst hey nonsense that is 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.710
 artillery April 1 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:34.480
 actually you are stuffing 10 frags 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.720
 technicians from level five as far as i am 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.980
 correctly understood, that's what you get 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.680
 the suitcase he 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:47.329
 at the beginning of the battle charges from these wildly 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.909
 about 30 seconds probably here and then 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:53.300
 let alone see see use 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:54.979
 you can use it with keys like this 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.699
 so so now further directly at 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:01:03.739
 you on the screen metalist reflected 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:04.890
 happening so here not to 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.240
 miss a moment and 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.850
 a little bit they 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:14.250
 did honestly i believe that t-34 is yours 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.340
 Coziness in the center and decide to use this 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.920
 art sight I press the button all 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.700
 I approach I approach as on 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.610
 ordinary artek that's been aiming with purpose 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.939
 I will connect the purposes t-34 departs actually 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.700
 Faith two two three and book begin 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.830
 fly buns see there actually 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.959
 saying something on the rainbow 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:42.240
 very much like this phrase was mine 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:46.789
 artillery and times you could use 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.789
 only once and after use 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.290
 must have filled 10 frags again and again you 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.530
 then 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.869
 give this secret weapon as far as she is 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.509
 I did not understand my homework 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:01.229
 damage caused me so it seemed 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.789
 and you can just collecting allies but 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.570
 actually a little hooked him 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:09.670
 This is exactly why write in the comments 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.040
 Who did all the damage with this 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.170
 things at least video that she 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.790
 gets and so on because i rather 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.069
 Total 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.000
 well for direct hits was most likely 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.939
 only for a period 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.129
 here write in comments like with 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:26.849
 The first of April you and I was a Cossack in 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.849
