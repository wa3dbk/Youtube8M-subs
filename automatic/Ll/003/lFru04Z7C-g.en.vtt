00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
summarize it so we're going to go with

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160 
summarize it so we're going to go with
the<00:00:26.250> kf5<00:00:26.730> submachine<00:00:27.539> gun<00:00:27.689> this<00:00:27.840> obviously

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
the kf5 submachine gun this obviously

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.330 
the kf5 submachine gun this obviously
you<00:00:28.230> want<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.560> pick<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.710> submachine<00:00:29.160> gun

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
you want to pick a submachine gun

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.230 
you want to pick a submachine gun
because<00:00:29.460> they're<00:00:29.609> faster<00:00:29.910> than<00:00:29.970> assault

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
because they're faster than assault

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.740 
because they're faster than assault
rifles

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
rifles

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.089 
rifles
you<00:00:30.929> can<00:00:31.050> get<00:00:31.170> around<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.410> lot<00:00:31.529> quicker<00:00:31.710> I've

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
you can get around a lot quicker I've

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.010 
you can get around a lot quicker I've
chosen<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.550> k5<00:00:33.000> over<00:00:33.450> something<00:00:33.780> like<00:00:33.809> the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
chosen the k5 over something like the

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.049 
chosen the k5 over something like the
air<00:00:34.170> someone<00:00:34.620> specifically<00:00:35.160> because<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.910> has

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
air someone specifically because it has

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.700 
air someone specifically because it has
better<00:00:36.329> range<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.960> air<00:00:37.050> someone<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.559> better

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
better range that air someone is better

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.860 
better range that air someone is better
at<00:00:37.980> close<00:00:38.250> ranges<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.360> does<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.660> lot<00:00:39.750> of

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
at close ranges and it does a lot of

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.720 
at close ranges and it does a lot of
damage<00:00:40.079> at<00:00:40.469> kind<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:40.829> close<00:00:41.100> vicinities

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
damage at kind of close vicinities

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.030 
damage at kind of close vicinities
whereas<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.120> kf5<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.320> very<00:00:43.559> good<00:00:43.800> at

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
whereas the kf5 is that very good at

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.440 
whereas the kf5 is that very good at
longer<00:00:44.340> ranges<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.030> I'm<00:00:45.090> going<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.270> choose

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
longer ranges so I'm going to choose

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.119 
longer ranges so I'm going to choose
that<00:00:45.600> for<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.840> stealth<00:00:46.079> loadout<00:00:46.500> because<00:00:46.950> it's

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
that for a stealth loadout because it's

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.709 
that for a stealth loadout because it's
more<00:00:47.309> kind<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.579> like<00:00:47.670> aggressive<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.510> fits

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
more kind of like aggressive and it fits

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.299 
more kind of like aggressive and it fits
the<00:00:48.870> build<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.140> lot<00:00:49.289> better<00:00:49.500> obviously<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.219> can

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
the build a lot better obviously you can

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.380 
the build a lot better obviously you can
want<00:00:50.460> suppression<00:00:50.850> on<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.210> keep

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
want suppression on that to keep

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.299 
want suppression on that to keep
stealthy<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.110> I've<00:00:52.440> gone<00:00:52.559> for<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.829> stock<00:00:53.160> so

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
stealthy and I've gone for a stock so

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.740 
stealthy and I've gone for a stock so
you<00:00:53.340> can<00:00:53.489> strafe<00:00:53.789> much<00:00:54.149> faster<00:00:54.539> when<00:00:54.660> you're

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
you can strafe much faster when you're

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.600 
you can strafe much faster when you're
aiming<00:00:54.870> outside<00:00:55.260> very<00:00:55.500> very<00:00:55.710> useful<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.219> a

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
aiming outside very very useful and a

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.799 
aiming outside very very useful and a
foregrip<00:00:57.059> because<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.360> helps<00:00:57.629> with<00:00:57.719> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
foregrip because it helps with the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.260 
foregrip because it helps with the
accuracy<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.320> ton<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.949> then<00:00:59.670> for<00:00:59.879> Perks<00:01:00.090> I'm

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
accuracy a ton and then for Perks I'm

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.670 
accuracy a ton and then for Perks I'm
going<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.480> use<00:01:00.600> low<00:01:00.809> profile<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.410> course<00:01:01.590> you

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
going to use low profile of course you

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.560 
going to use low profile of course you
want<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.829> stay<00:01:01.980> off<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.190> UAV<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:02.820> second<00:01:03.449> tier

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
want to stay off the UAV in second tier

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.789 
want to stay off the UAV in second tier
I've<00:01:03.660> gone<00:01:03.750> for<00:01:03.930> cold<00:01:04.170> blooded<00:01:04.409> it's<00:01:04.589> going<00:01:04.739> to

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
I picked for err cold-blooded was the no

I picked for err cold-blooded was the no
enemy<00:01:19.320> call-outs<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:19.830> was<00:01:19.920> actually<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.189> huge

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
enemy call-outs I was actually a huge

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.249 
enemy call-outs I was actually a huge

thing in recent ecology game since

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.870 
thing in recent ecology game since
ghosts<00:01:22.560> have<00:01:22.770> actually<00:01:23.040> added<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.430> bunch<00:01:23.759> of

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
call-outs the enemy is going to start

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.050 
call-outs the enemy is going to start
calling<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.470> out<00:01:25.710> actual<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.460> will<00:01:26.670> make

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
calling you out actual a I will make

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.520 
calling you out actual a I will make
call-outs<00:01:27.450> if<00:01:27.630> they<00:01:27.750> spot<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.320> when<00:01:28.439> they

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
call-outs if they spot you so when they

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.319 
call-outs if they spot you so when they
see<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.860> you'll<00:01:29.070> hear<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.430> enemy<00:01:29.549> at<00:01:30.030> Quora

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
see you you'll hear the enemy at Quora

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.850 
see you you'll hear the enemy at Quora
at<00:01:30.420> your<00:01:30.540> position<00:01:30.930> location<00:01:31.439> on<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.590> map<00:01:31.619> and

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
at your position location on the map and

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.890 
at your position location on the map and
that's<00:01:32.009> actually<00:01:32.369> really<00:01:32.729> really<00:01:33.360> crucial<00:01:33.570> at

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
that's actually really really crucial at

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.330 
that's actually really really crucial at
giving<00:01:34.229> away<00:01:34.380> your<00:01:34.409> position<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.280> a

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
giving away your position so this is a

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.100 
giving away your position so this is a
very<00:01:35.579> good<00:01:35.729> perk<00:01:35.970> specifically<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:36.990> the

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
very good perk specifically so the

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.569 
very good perk specifically so the
enemies<00:01:37.409> will<00:01:37.619> not<00:01:37.650> do<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.280> they<00:01:38.340> want

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
enemies will not do that and they want

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:39.679 
enemies will not do that and they want
to<00:01:38.670> know<00:01:38.820> you're<00:01:39.060> it's<00:01:39.210> going<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.420> help<00:01:39.509> you

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
to know you're it's going to help you

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
tier this is going to be helpful

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.539 
tier this is going to be helpful
specifically<00:01:46.530> not<00:01:46.710> because<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.100> increases

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
specifically not because it increases

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.490 
specifically not because it increases
your<00:01:47.579> raid<00:01:47.970> on<00:01:48.210> kind<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.659> map<00:01:48.840> awareness<00:01:49.350> but

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
your raid on kind of map awareness but

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.960 
your raid on kind of map awareness but
also<00:01:49.560> because<00:01:50.340> there's<00:01:50.490> another<00:01:50.729> feature

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
also because there's another feature

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.420 
also because there's another feature
which<00:01:51.600> allows<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.200> not<00:01:52.680> show<00:01:52.950> up<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.220> death

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
which allows you to not show up a death

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.859 
which allows you to not show up a death
marker<00:01:53.790> when<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.000> kill<00:01:54.240> an<00:01:54.329> enemy<00:01:54.420> normally

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
it's going to show up a tiny little

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.450 
it's going to show up a tiny little
death<00:01:57.689> marker<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.380> enemy<00:01:58.710> team<00:01:58.920> are<00:01:59.280> going

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
death marker so the enemy team are going

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.859 
death marker so the enemy team are going
to<00:01:59.520> see<00:01:59.700> that<00:01:59.939> one<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.149> their<00:02:00.329> teammates<00:02:00.630> has

there's<00:02:03.180> someone<00:02:03.420> around<00:02:03.540> that's<00:02:03.960> going<00:02:04.140> to

there's someone around that's going to

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.690 
there's someone around that's going to
take<00:02:04.439> them<00:02:04.710> out<00:02:04.829> as<00:02:05.009> well<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.460> this

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
take them out as well so this

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.550 
take them out as well so this

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
very very good perk for a stealth

very very good perk for a stealth
loadout<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:15.660> I've<00:02:15.720> gone<00:02:15.870> for<00:02:16.080> that<00:02:16.200> over

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
loadout and I've gone for that over

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.290 
loadout and I've gone for that over
something<00:02:17.070> like<00:02:17.100> blind<00:02:17.490> I<00:02:17.640> was<00:02:17.790> just<00:02:18.000> hide<00:02:18.150> you

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
something like blind I was just hide you

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.910 
something like blind I was just hide you
from<00:02:18.330> killstreaks<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:19.080> find<00:02:19.500> that<00:02:19.590> most<00:02:19.710> of<00:02:19.830> the

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
from killstreaks I find that most of the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.170 
from killstreaks I find that most of the
time<00:02:20.070> if<00:02:20.160> there's<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.430> kill<00:02:20.580> treat<00:02:20.790> called<00:02:21.000> in

time if there's a kill treat called in

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.490 
time if there's a kill treat called in
very<00:02:21.420> rarely<00:02:21.690> I'll<00:02:21.930> just<00:02:22.080> go<00:02:22.200> inside<00:02:22.470> a

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
very rarely I'll just go inside a

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.350 
very rarely I'll just go inside a
building<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.220> we<00:02:23.340> sneak<00:02:23.580> around<00:02:23.760> in<00:02:24.150> that

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
building and we sneak around in that

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.000 
building and we sneak around in that
sense<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:24.990> then<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.200> next<00:02:25.410> part<00:02:25.560> I'm<00:02:25.860> going

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
sense and then the next part I'm going

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.620 
sense and then the next part I'm going
to<00:02:26.070> using<00:02:26.340> is<00:02:26.460> a<00:02:26.490> cos<00:02:26.730> blaster<00:02:27.270> press<00:02:27.450> this

to using is a cos blaster press this

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.630 
to using is a cos blaster press this
massively<00:02:28.110> helpful<00:02:28.410> for<00:02:28.980> being<00:02:29.190> stealthy

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
massively helpful for being stealthy

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.800 
massively helpful for being stealthy
because<00:02:29.880> if<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.030> don't<00:02:30.210> know<00:02:30.330> when<00:02:30.540> you<00:02:30.630> do

the double jump all that stuff you're

these little pings that show up so

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.320 
these little pings that show up so
obviously<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:38.490> want<00:02:38.550> that<00:02:38.820> to<00:02:38.970> be<00:02:39.090> hair
