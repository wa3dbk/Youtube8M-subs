00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.599
 very good girls very good guys 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:08.270
 always today we are in new news very 

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:12.050
 interesting debate end 4 because here 102 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:15.680
 the game was about to be delayed 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:18.410
 it would also have really been the host 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.810
 with onion because now you can with 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.580
 Onion is called since more than a thousand 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.240
 four was about to be delayed in 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.160
 xbox wii and playstation 4 explain that the 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.609
 difficulty of creating a game while 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.100
 is seconds in the console has not been 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:37.190
 closed or they have that problem and 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.670
 taiz evaluated in delaying by the exit 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.050
 of the matte end 4 in the consoles next in 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.760
 because of two problems 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.039
 found during the development of 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.929
 these versions when facing a 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.789
 new hardware and in particular the 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:51.979
 problems arising from changes in 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.989
 the technical specifications of the 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:56.539
 same consoles themselves that were going 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.999
 experimenting as they progressed in their 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.190
 design by sony and by part of 

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:04.080
 microsoft as explained 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:08.340
 patrick bach executive producer 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.190
 would be the title because there were many 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.920
 problems in the with the changes on 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.660
 all in design the forgiveness and this 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.940
 would have involved delaying the game 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:21.240
 beyond the launch sale of 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.920
 the xbox varied from 16-4 although they managed 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.600
 overcome all the problems according to 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.140
 said and have it ready by the end of 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.570
 November when the motor consoles 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.880
 you already know in europe and on the other side 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.039
 from the puddle 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.759
 sure they have been very aggressive 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:41.110
 phil 4 cups are determined to 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:45.510
 make it a launch game 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.730
 Sorry, this is being in the mouth 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.350
 I think that people do not realize what 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.630
 hard that is to stay in a game while 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.240
 At the same time , the 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.910
 hardware must understand that since 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.760
 everything is very complicated because both 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.110
 game developer parts 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.670
 hardware designers have to 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.540
 agree on many things 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.690
 achieve multiple multiple commitments 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.700
 according to such they knew that he was going above all 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.460
 but I think that people will understand 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.150
 from outside because it's going to be a game of 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.909
 launch and it's very 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.280
 so you know how always 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:25.530
 informing the last one we are already you know 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.140
 working already some new design does not 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.560
 worry we see them in the next 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.560
 bye
