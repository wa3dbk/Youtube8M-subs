 Data and war machine transported 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.120
 Called priest 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.199
 expressly praised also not communicate 

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:10.989
 There she experienced 

00:00:10.989 --> 00:00:12.699
 1870 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:16.960
 To the chagrin of the troops, especially the sport played the apartment is 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:17.949
 a farce 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.130
 Origin crosses there by foot 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.289
 and the last stocked there then again the honor here is on the spot around the 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.289
 Prolls her slogan behind 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:28.460
 Rohde 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.239
 Pressure exerted 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.659
 then there was the piece and Schmidtheim Bass Trier in old age 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.590
 Brown had to talk a lot about the railway's military to the schools 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.640
 benefit but should 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.450
 and actually on the contrary 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.880
 but you can of course the prices one way 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.880
 We use the free fall to one ourselves 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.610
 in the context of the France for train on 20 71 one still has it 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.489
 What a decisive strategic role 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.460
 to play 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.240
 before that, you have never been able to quickly man and material of a 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.450
 to bring to b on one had to go very very fast 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.100
 The train was then completed in no time 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.790
 and per teacher that either a big public or a great one 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.930
 decorated opening train is driven then percent are already the first 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.930
 both play constructs over the rather run the course 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.730
 so were Aschheim clarifying soldiers 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.730
 the Eifel route a leg 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.690
 the railway tunnel in the people belongs to secondary lines Santala the shortly before the 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.690
 found World War I. 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.370
 at Hildesheim shows a line to the Ruhr city 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.890
 the Prussian Minister of War Lethal Weapon 4 degrees 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.230
 it had to go corresponding question 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.929
 be involved too promptly for a long time 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:07.210
 Merkel is now able to resell 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.690
 and there are in principle by relative tight radii have been excellent and here 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.150
 The radii have very much correspond to those of the animal trains 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.259
 in the end there is also a percentage 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:21.529
 bigger still a short pass 

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:24.409
 the route strikes me too hard 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:27.409
 VW think it is the 9th 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:30.559
 that is annoying 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:33.559
 on this route Moses Allison height 

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:37.619
 and conspicuous that that is me the track 

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:40.400
 Sevimli meanders 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.400
 and the only reason was that you 

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:48.609
 1871 after the richest 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:51.459
 let Chancellor Otto von Bismarck 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:52.840
 and railway company 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.529
 the rail network died 

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:56.879
 the state railway 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.879
 intended to national unity 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.700
 From their comrades, the route continues at that time 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.700
 to a boys practice ground near the danish border 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:16.779
 should sit in the trains off 

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:20.159
 on the third of August 1914 Germany declared 

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:27.909
 So four days before 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:33.389
 the train was actually blocked for the per-time in traffic that is 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:36.359
 So no people are allowed to ride 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.839
 Percent it was all Denise subordinated from the first also Rust 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.399
 the military even took over the 

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:49.499
 Railroad and it just happened that fits the military 

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:52.499
 wanted and what important force for the military 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:58.159
 Collection point for the military jury from Cologne and from the city hall up 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:01.159
 the station is her body 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:09.019
 over 2400 railway workers need a smooth process for this 

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:16.150
 the First World War is the first 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.769
 Help her 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.769
 the railway plays a crucial role 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:26.430
 the trains again with, for example, the club on the route 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.409
 still under control 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:31.499
 the boys were still missing 

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:32.490
 Wiesbaden 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.490
 We are our employee 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:40.520
 1940 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.360
 after mobilizing viruses are open mind 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.669
 We were the better answer 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.749
 Dornbirn the school 

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:51.749
 those at the railway line stay where a train station was 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:55.279
 the other 2 Dora free to jubilate 

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:59.739

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:14.349
 When the railroad came to the Eifel, she distributed the remote area 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:17.509
 People were transported 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:19.849
 as well as soldiers and weapons 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:21.460

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:37.999
 the Bahnbetriebswerk in Tirol Stein from the 1920s
