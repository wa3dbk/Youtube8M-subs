00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.380
 in the suite of talloires 

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:13.640
 here it takes Danish laboratory 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.640
 the atmosphere is in full swing 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.220
 not yet 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:27.609
 and always 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.110
 thanks to my with less than six minutes ashore extraordinary in our studio 

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:34.660
 thank you for coming 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.590
 what is it applied to the hands 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.310
 yes, the movements are almost invisible 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.210
 how did they do 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.570
 you have to be passionate to train properly a lot of training 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.570
 Yes, a lot 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.000
 the training paid off 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.820
 malik holds an incredible world record for speed on the drums 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.280
 with 1247 beats per minute or more than 20 years per second 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.170
 but what happens when the wand all this saddens me and the battery the 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.560
 human body 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.360
 it's time to find out 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.560
 we would like technical state film with high speed camera to see what 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.760
 to get there we need 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.630
 the gentleness 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.440
 gold a little disappointing on the timer a machine that calculates the number of 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.170
 beats to the nearest second set to ten seconds while it will be 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.710
 possible and that you can be at 4 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.970
 see if you can marry her record 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.210
 3 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:40.520
 he inspires deeply and it's gone 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.840
 it will be 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.840
 everything is fine depressed per second it's really amazing 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.150
 the big drummers lesson 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.210
 and they also show great regularity 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.490
 in slow motion the panic movements are clear 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.490
 everything is in the wrist 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.720
 while the chopsticks are just as low the rest of his body moves 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.719
 barely 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.239
 and what's going on for mac with this technique to the whole battery 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:16.819
 that's where you love heat and light 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.779
 I'm going to take your sunscreen 

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:20.069
 it is 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.409
 here is a solo drummer during which no one will flee 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.799
 excellent 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.799
 the beaters roques work up to the limits of human resistance 

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:54.229
 they burn up to 600 calories per hour 

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:57.599
 they may lead to heart problems from injuries due 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:58.479
 stress 

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:01.479
 we even talked about pulmonary collapse 

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:04.979
 without me it's all about having the ability to go so fast from everything 

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:08.999
 control you're not exactly where you visit whenever altera I 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:12.149
 tell me that I have to contract the 2012 muscles those of my back and my 

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:15.149
 belly as external 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:27.219
 I'm not expecting you to say that so I was expecting exactly 

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:30.309
 that I think I'm forced to box 

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:32.619
 if it's open I will not be able to make the move 

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:33.459
 correctly 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.829
 I need to know which parts of my body contracted so as not to lose the 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.599
 control I see the ratp it looks like a lot of people are hurting themselves and killing 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.419
 because they expect small muscles to do the job 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:44.839
 big mouths month without pay 

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:48.079
 It's exactly that 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.879
 he does not serve chopsticks with his fingers 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.300
 he uses the biggest muscles in his hand 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.219
 he keeps his fingers relaxed 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:59.489
 it is in stalking not what to look a little like tamagochi been strained 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.559
 during their thomas mÃ¼ller initiatives and bounces three or four times each 

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:05.519
 clothing m 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.879
 the control was tense but if we have problems of tendinitis this film is 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:11.879
 for all these movements can be seen well that witnesses must be tourists 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:14.519
 look closely at the left hand from the left 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.249
 his ring finger elie baup 

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:20.239
 very contrasted while the rest of his body extended the work of a 

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:24.959
 out of curiosity as to how much it costs the company or in 

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:26.520
 head with adults 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.770
 far from calming down when I hit the duo cymbals in another I think to 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.190
 tap on the lower gold so when I'm doing a movement I'm already thinking 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.969
 later 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:38.639
 several times at a stroke of advanced 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.080
 it shows 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.080
 look at these little light knocks it's like killing a fly 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:45.110
 he 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.770
 the next one coming home said to have had a cover and showers 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.539
 too strong 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:55.539
 for senators to go to the attacked herself 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:04.889
 it's a very classic snare it's not funny no me that 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:07.939
 it's really amazing 

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:10.629
 I can not believe my eyes 

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:14.690
 the skin of the snare seems almost liquid while it absorbs 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:17.050
 the impact of the wand 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.849
 and it continues until madagascar has been again 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:21.520
 exceptional 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.160
 we bought 1 and especially at its base get ready to pass to 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.160
 the action to do something like 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:34.199
 it's crazy it's amazing 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:37.099
 I'm watching it has to give so that one does not spread all around 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:40.499
 the central l1 and finally on the other side he ends up going crazy 

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:42.499
 this is true 

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:44.569
 according to returns before 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:47.589
 I hardly shoot them like a patient for years 

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:51.319
 we forget one and the same terminal are still not broken I do not think so 

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:54.319
 my eyes 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.710
 it's incredible 

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:04.369
 free atmosphere always in full swing 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.930
 emanates as rock star 

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:11.469
 that's a final 

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:15.719
 for people who break up as often as we do 

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:17.009
 we should know what
