00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.389
 girls okay 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.660
 So today I come with this fingernail 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.559
 people do my good together 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.780
 mini 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.359
 so thats it easy to win I used it 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.490
 four glazes I think if you 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.010
 You want to know how I did this nail? 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.199
 keep watching a video and let's go 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.970
 learn this nail here did not notice 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.740
 I agree with my nails but it is that I use 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.199
 and the one who accompanies me here on the channel 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.020
 You know what they do not break then how 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.170
 It works, I will never stop using it. 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.020
 So I already made a little French here. 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.170
 anyway I used this nail polish 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.960
 from Jordan that is a red of my 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.190
 honorable my red used an enamel 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.829
 White I used a black enamel that already comes 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.620
 with a brush but you can use 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.640
 any black with any brush 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.570
 code a crochet needle 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:09.560
 so let's start with 2 small squares 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:09.560
 so one more pond 1 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.260
 2 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.260
 and let's draw an x between them 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.220
 and let's fill in what's left over there 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.280
 inside 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.900
 in the rest you will follow up with the line 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.370
 with black enamel 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.370
 here on the red river 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.460
 if you still have a little bit the other side is 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.960
 go pick up you'll get the white enamel 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:52.170
 with the point of the crochet needle and goes 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:59.310
 make tiny balls or smaller you 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:01.950
 Can you do it then, that's it? 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:07.399

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:11.160
