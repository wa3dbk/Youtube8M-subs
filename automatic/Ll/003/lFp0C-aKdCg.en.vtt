like<00:00:46.750> this<00:00:46.930> this<00:00:47.860> is<00:00:49.110> really<00:00:50.110> good<00:00:50.260> car<00:00:50.530> but<00:00:50.559> it

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
like this this is really good car but it

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:52.920 
like this this is really good car but it
may<00:00:51.070> become<00:00:51.400> like<00:00:51.640> this<00:00:51.879> this<00:00:52.390> body<00:00:52.629> isn't

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
may become like this this body isn't

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.920 
may become like this this body isn't
custom<00:00:53.620> oh<00:00:55.589> and<00:00:56.589> OH

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
custom oh and OH

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.079 
custom oh and OH
the<00:00:59.320> only<00:00:59.500> thing<00:00:59.739> we<00:00:59.860> did<00:01:00.010> to<00:01:00.159> the<00:01:00.280> body<00:01:00.460> is<00:01:00.640> I

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
the only thing we did to the body is I

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:06.990 
the only thing we did to the body is I
made<00:01:01.960> holes<00:01:02.260> in<00:01:02.680> it<00:01:02.920> so<00:01:03.549> that<00:01:05.280> air<00:01:06.280> could<00:01:06.729> run

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
made holes in it so that air could run

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.850 
made holes in it so that air could run
through<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:12.600> did<00:01:13.600> run<00:01:13.750> into<00:01:13.990> one<00:01:14.440> problem

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
through and I did run into one problem

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.690 
through and I did run into one problem
when<00:01:15.400> I<00:01:15.520> was<00:01:15.670> driving<00:01:16.000> this<00:01:16.420> car<00:01:16.750> it's<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:18.460> went

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
when I was driving this car it's it went

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.190 
when I was driving this car it's it went
so<00:01:19.000> fast<00:01:19.600> that<00:01:21.119> everything<00:01:22.119> got<00:01:22.359> really

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
so fast that everything got really

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.279 
so fast that everything got really
really<00:01:23.380> hot<00:01:23.710> and<00:01:25.140> we<00:01:26.140> I<00:01:26.740> went<00:01:27.189> to<00:01:27.460> hose<00:01:27.700> it<00:01:28.000> down

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:28.289 
really hot and we I went to hose it down

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:37.020 
really hot and we I went to hose it down
and<00:01:30.509> when<00:01:31.509> the<00:01:31.659> water<00:01:31.990> hit<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:34.740> motor<00:01:35.740> it<00:01:36.579> like

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
and when the water hit the motor it like

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.120 
and when the water hit the motor it like
seriously<00:01:37.659> boiled<00:01:38.469> off<00:01:39.659> so<00:01:40.659> I<00:01:41.170> know<00:01:41.829> there

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
seriously boiled off so I know there

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.440 
seriously boiled off so I know there
would<00:01:42.280> have<00:01:42.399> to<00:01:42.490> be<00:01:42.579> something<00:01:42.880> done<00:01:43.270> about

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
would have to be something done about

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.760 
would have to be something done about
this<00:01:43.810> right<00:01:44.439> here

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
this right here

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:53.910 
this right here
and<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:48.399> I<00:01:49.049> built<00:01:50.189> this<00:01:51.719> this<00:01:52.719> is<00:01:53.109> made<00:01:53.619> out<00:01:53.649> of

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
and so I built this this is made out of

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.690 
and so I built this this is made out of
its<00:01:54.729> a<00:01:54.880> watering<00:01:55.600> tank<00:01:55.960> it's<00:01:56.380> made<00:01:56.619> out<00:01:56.829> of<00:01:56.859> an

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
its a watering tank it's made out of an

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.940 
its a watering tank it's made out of an
old<00:01:57.850> gas<00:01:58.359> tank<00:01:59.819> for<00:02:00.819> a<00:02:00.880> gas<00:02:01.270> car<00:02:01.659> so<00:02:02.469> I<00:02:02.499> turned

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
old gas tank for a gas car so I turned

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.840 
old gas tank for a gas car so I turned
it<00:02:03.100> into<00:02:03.310> a<00:02:04.079> watering<00:02:05.079> tank<00:02:05.429> there's<00:02:06.429> a<00:02:06.549> little

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
it into a watering tank there's a little

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.410 
it into a watering tank there's a little
cooling<00:02:07.659> tower<00:02:08.170> down<00:02:08.530> here<00:02:09.009> pump<00:02:09.970> way<00:02:10.240> down

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
cooling tower down here pump way down

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.270 
cooling tower down here pump way down
there<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:12.360> um<00:02:13.360> this<00:02:13.990> water<00:02:14.350> runs<00:02:15.100> through

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
there and um this water runs through

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.960 
there and um this water runs through
hair<00:02:15.640> down<00:02:16.240> dryer<00:02:16.600> hair<00:02:17.160> right<00:02:18.160> here<00:02:18.460> comes

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
hair down dryer hair right here comes

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.050 
hair down dryer hair right here comes
over<00:02:19.600> through<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:20.200> other<00:02:20.350> side<00:02:20.800> goes<00:02:21.790> through

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
over through the other side goes through

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.660 
over through the other side goes through
here<00:02:22.330> through<00:02:23.230> here<00:02:23.440> and<00:02:23.650> around<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.190> motor

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
here through here and around the motor

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:25.530 
here through here and around the motor
throw<00:02:25.180> the

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
throw the

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
throw the
um<00:02:25.750> cooling<00:02:26.650> tower<00:02:27.930> runs<00:02:28.930> faster<00:02:29.409> cooling

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
um cooling tower runs faster cooling

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.649 
um cooling tower runs faster cooling
tower<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.159> gets<00:02:30.400> cooled<00:02:30.670> down<00:02:30.879> and<00:02:31.329> wraps

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
tower and gets cooled down and wraps

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:34.289 
tower and gets cooled down and wraps
around<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.650> motor<00:02:32.680> cooling<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.819> motor<00:02:34.030> at

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
around the motor cooling the motor at

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:40.349 
around the motor cooling the motor at
all<00:02:34.450> times<00:02:35.579> so<00:02:36.689> this<00:02:37.689> motor<00:02:38.049> is<00:02:38.819> cold<00:02:39.819> than

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:40.359 
all times so this motor is cold than

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:41.729 
all times so this motor is cold than
everything<00:02:40.599> else<00:02:40.840> you<00:02:41.049> can<00:02:41.230> drive<00:02:41.439> it<00:02:41.620> like

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
everything else you can drive it like

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.210 
everything else you can drive it like
real<00:02:42.310> fast<00:02:42.640> for<00:02:43.000> a<00:02:43.319> real<00:02:44.319> long<00:02:44.769> amount<00:02:45.579> of<00:02:45.819> time

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
real fast for a real long amount of time

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:54.089 
real fast for a real long amount of time
so<00:02:48.659> it<00:02:51.030> really<00:02:52.030> cool<00:02:52.620> this<00:02:53.620> is<00:02:53.680> one<00:02:53.950> of<00:02:54.010> the

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
so it really cool this is one of the

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.429 
so it really cool this is one of the
cars<00:02:54.310> are<00:02:54.489> fixed<00:02:54.819> up<00:02:54.939> it's<00:02:55.599> got<00:02:55.810> a<00:02:55.989> battery

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:56.439 
cars are fixed up it's got a battery

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:58.800 
cars are fixed up it's got a battery
right<00:02:56.709> here<00:02:56.769> it's<00:02:57.760> there<00:02:58.209> supposed<00:02:58.569> to<00:02:58.629> be<00:02:58.689> a

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
right here it's there supposed to be a

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.379 
right here it's there supposed to be a
battery<00:02:59.200> right<00:02:59.409> here<00:02:59.680> and<00:02:59.889> the<00:03:00.639> battery<00:03:01.030> runs

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:01.389 
battery right here and the battery runs

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:06.979 
battery right here and the battery runs
only<00:03:02.049> just<00:03:02.829> the<00:03:03.549> pump<00:03:03.790> and<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:05.049> taste<00:03:05.430> just

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
only just the pump and the taste just

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.879 
only just the pump and the taste just
for<00:03:07.989> that<00:03:08.169> and<00:03:08.530> then<00:03:08.709> needs<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:09.220> marriage<00:03:09.489> when

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:10.889 
for that and then needs to marriage when

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:14.190 
for that and then needs to marriage when
there's<00:03:11.889> two<00:03:12.069> batteries<00:03:12.569> it's<00:03:13.569> meant<00:03:13.840> for<00:03:13.930> two

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
there's two batteries it's meant for two

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.069 
there's two batteries it's meant for two
batteries<00:03:14.590> over<00:03:14.739> here<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:17.549> everything<00:03:18.549> runs

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
batteries over here and everything runs

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:23.069 
batteries over here and everything runs
33<00:03:20.079> volts<00:03:20.739> just<00:03:21.010> like<00:03:21.819> most<00:03:22.030> of<00:03:22.239> our<00:03:22.329> other<00:03:22.599> my

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
33 volts just like most of our other my

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:29.849 
33 volts just like most of our other my
other<00:03:23.319> cars<00:03:23.620> so<00:03:26.700> this<00:03:27.700> um<00:03:28.260> this<00:03:29.260> really<00:03:29.650> good

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
other cars so this um this really good
