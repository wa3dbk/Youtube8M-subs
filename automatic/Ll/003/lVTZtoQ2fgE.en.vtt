00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
two approaches to this you could wash it

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.730 
two approaches to this you could wash it
off<00:00:39.220> scrub<00:00:40.060> it<00:00:40.150> off<00:00:40.300> or<00:00:40.570> you<00:00:41.050> can<00:00:41.230> bake<00:00:41.440> it<00:00:41.590> off

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:41.740 
off scrub it off or you can bake it off

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.520 
off scrub it off or you can bake it off
I<00:00:42.040> prefer<00:00:42.550> to<00:00:42.670> bake<00:00:42.850> it<00:00:43.000> off<00:00:43.180> so<00:00:44.140> let's<00:00:44.410> show

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
I prefer to bake it off so let's show

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.920 
I prefer to bake it off so let's show
you<00:00:44.560> how<00:00:44.740> that's<00:00:44.890> done<00:00:45.150> all<00:00:46.150> righty<00:00:46.540> so<00:00:46.810> the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930
