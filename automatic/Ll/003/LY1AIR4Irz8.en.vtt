00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.960
 the third trailer came the version 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.420
 full throne and what can I say is more 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.039
 how extraordinary the last trailers 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.379
 they were pretty good but we have 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:16.420
 that something was missing but now 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.550
 we have everything we have wished 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.800
 We wanted to see the avengers in action 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.490
 now we have the avengers in action 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.490
 how it should be 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.890
 do not 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.390
 hi everyone on the nobodies in this one 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.210
 I bring you one beyond the trailer of the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.210
 new trailer the avengers 6 john fulton 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.210
 let's start 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.399
 As usual, the trailer starts 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.890
 as a panning then we see what 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.379
 that seems to be the bultron castle 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.690
 well I mean because you castle 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.250
 pay attention a troll is in his 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.140
 throne fascinated me 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.710
 this scene because it refers to the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.360
 comics entered the king of this era 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.030
 we see more scenes of what seems to be 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.830
 the awakening of a throne that is already very 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.080
 view this scene to the truth but 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.390
 then we see another one already stopped and 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.430
 pulling the wires this makes 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.340
 reference to the iab being a puppet he 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.590
 does not have them there is too much destruction 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.000
 for the different scenarios I want 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.909
 think that ultra is going to be a threat 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.640
 truly global world and not just 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.560
 new york we were finally able to see the tower 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.110
 of the avengers in all their splendor 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.869
 I love this scene of all the 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.630
 creating ultra and listening to tronistas 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.789
 talking about failure 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.409
 and we share his plans he wanted 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:38.719
 save the world and then things do not 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.460
 they turned out very well and then if not 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.380
 we have very clear how is it that last 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.270
 lives and is a robot we have a bruce 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.960
 banner rubbing us that it's about 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.490
 artificial intelligence and the truth is 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.950
 that you do not have to be a mega scientist 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.780
 to deduce this then this incredible 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.880
 this scene where we listen to Tony 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.009
 stark talk about how people go 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.140
 to pay for their mistakes and we see how 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.140
 Captain America is unable to stop 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.000
 the cars that are going to fall into the void and I 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.770
 I feel that with this captain america 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.780
 he's going to feel guilty but then he goes to 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.549
 I was going to tell him to see me 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.860
 these people fell in their cars 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:14.480
 but because they fell mainly 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.670
 because of the disaster in the city and 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.340
 who causes this disaster point who 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.069
 record ultra ironman then it will start 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.569
 friction captain america iron man no 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.340
 I'm saying that this is going to be what 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.750
 will detonate the civil war I'm just 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.360
 saying that this will help the 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.610
 friction increase then less a bit of 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.980
 the filtered scene of Tony Stark Iron 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.260
 and discussing from here we already 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.400
 we can go taking our side team 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.590
 America 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.360
 ironman I am personally team 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.099
 america forever 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.260
 and good if all this destruction was not 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.879
 enough to scrub him update 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.950
 that he had watered it by creating a troll 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:53.180
 we have the same black widow 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.250
 rubbing the same thing until when 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.010
 rubs his mistakes to people is 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.230
 beautiful now yes it is more than obvious 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.569
 we have a romance between hulk and black 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.700
 widow this was pretty predictable from 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.859
 the other trailers well let's say this 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.450
 very Arab scene and the beast judged and 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:11.060
 black widow who does holding on to the 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.030
 hand seeing himself we already saw him come the 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.250
 black widow is dangerous and not only in 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.620
 combat since it apparently knows that it is 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.379
 beautiful llosa her charms to catch 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.510
 to all the men in armandos had 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:26.090
 the odd look of accomplices with 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.310
 tony stark on avenue we know how to have something 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.739
 with jockey in the winter soldier 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.370
 with captain america and now we see her with 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:36.610
 hulk who selector is likely there 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.040
 take care of the black widow 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.530
 this scene of a guy pulling claws 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.380
 many of being saying is wolverine 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.150
 Please not although not ruled out 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.040
 possibility that the people who 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.830
 they created this trailer cut out 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.660
 this scene to create controversy and 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.300
 that many fans will cheat by believing that 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.220
 it was about coming back and it is nothing more 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.560
 and nothing less than hockey getting ready 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.830
 for the battle if they pay attention in 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.480
 the lower part we can see its arc 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.580
 Then comes one of the best scenes 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.980
 of the trailer we see the avengers in 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.959
 team running in action the question 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.200
 here is how they should do to survive 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.940
 hockey took care of her with all this adrenaline 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.669
 I say we have to because fly iron man 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.739
 also hulk is cool captain america is going 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.780
 on their motorcycle but they are giving 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.130
 kicks to the air is like they can fall 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.110
 standing at that speed 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.730
 good are the avengers equal and if the 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.950
 scene that we have seen many times 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.540
 of black widow falling on his motorcycle looks 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.490
 amazing this scene but it's already very 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.919
 view after we see Tony Stark 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.990
 grabbing the logic center in the gem 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.950
 of infinity very to see how we 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.680
 explain the powers of this one 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.540
 perhaps the center will be the culprit of everything 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.790
 Well, do not rule out the possibility 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.040
 that the Tony Stark experiment 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.930
 troll has turned bad for having 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.150
 had contact with this gem of the 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.870
 infinite although as has already been revealed 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.340
 In Internet 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.590
 the center will be involved 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.800
 directly with quiksilver and starlet 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:03.440
 which if this is totally linked with 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.420
 the origin of inhuman speech 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.120
 encouraging nick fury could not miss 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:10.130
 again this is where we see ultra 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.590
 and the twins behind him apparently 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.600
 are in a kind of factory I think that 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.240
 it's about the ultra personal factory 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.970
 to create his droids we see the captain 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.520
 america thor already fast to fight 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.530
 against the last nor the genres yorke ultra 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.480
 sing quiksilver style which and for 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.150
 to protect the factory from their droids 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.590
 we have this emotional being where 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.360
 we listen to speak to capitan america 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.760
 as if I was about to 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.950
 sacrifice for all humanity in 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.170
 abelló is one there is a sacrifice mission 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.330
 greater equal and now it 's steve's turn 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:43.750
 rogers although obviously it's not going to 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.270
 dying we have to inhabit america 3 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.860
 I was fascinated by this scene of captain 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.020
 america against ultra on top of the 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:53.140
 truck and how it happens will have taken care of 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.450
 motorcycle to pick up the shield taras we can 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.640
 see more of the battle between hulk ironman 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.560
 and we still get to see a lot about 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:02.440
 this battle I think we have not seen 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:05.290
 the best we can finally see those who 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:07.090
 less in action and this is nothing in the 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.910
 we will see them in all their 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.740
 splendor demos action and more action 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.960
 we have this being where everything is 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.390
 challenging ultra and if that's enough 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.640
 bars but the coolest thing of all is the 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.020
 new armani costume that we can see and 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.810
 If a court sufficiently 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.880
 intimidating can now fly this 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.190
 battle paints to make it more epic you 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.770
 He has seen a part of me in the cinema 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:31.570
 has the fallen avengers and vision 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.700
 taking action to fight against a 

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.380
 troll and why not to close with 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.180
 Gold pin this amazing trailer 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:40.240
 we have our first official distance 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:42.370
 to vision pay attention to the gem 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.650
 shining on the forehead of vision 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.750
 I do not want to ruffle them or anything but not 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.820
 I rule out the possibility that you can 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.560
 try an infinity gem 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:53.230
 I say what makes him missing a 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.360
 android to make a human soul like that 

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:57.550
 it could be the gem of the soul 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.130
 good by amount that was all express 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:02.110
 is all this analysis really I can not 

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:04.630
