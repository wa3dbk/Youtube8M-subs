00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
got a pretty simple box this is similar

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.580 
got a pretty simple box this is similar
to<00:00:47.100> what<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.460> saw<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.730> s4<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.260> lot<00:00:49.559> of

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
to what you saw the s4 in so a lot of

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.650 
to what you saw the s4 in so a lot of
the<00:00:49.860> same<00:00:50.039> packaging<00:00:50.550> here<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.120> some<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.600> the

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
the same packaging here and some of the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.020 
the same packaging here and some of the
specs<00:00:51.930> in<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.199> back<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:53.190> course<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.489> 10.1

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
specs in the back is of course a 10.1

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.900 
specs in the back is of course a 10.1
display<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.750> it's<00:00:54.930> got<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.079> resolution<00:00:55.379> of

2560<00:00:56.910> by<00:00:57.360> 1600<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.739> that's<00:00:58.980> better<00:00:59.160> than<00:00:59.370> 1080p

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
2560 by 1600 so that's better than 1080p

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.420 
2560 by 1600 so that's better than 1080p
and<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.989> course<00:01:01.140> have<00:01:01.440> 1080p<00:01:01.949> playback

and you of course have 1080p playback

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.969 
and you of course have 1080p playback

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
GPS as an IR blaster so you can control

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.710 
GPS as an IR blaster so you can control
your<00:01:05.070> television<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.880> things<00:01:06.000> like<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.240> and

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
it's also got two quad-core processors

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.510 
it's also got two quad-core processors
one<00:01:09.030> o'clock<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.540> 1.9<00:01:10.229> gigahertz<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.920> one

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
one o'clock that 1.9 gigahertz and one

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.940 
one o'clock that 1.9 gigahertz and one
is<00:01:11.640> at<00:01:11.760> one<00:01:11.939> point<00:01:12.119> 3<00:01:12.450> gigahertz<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.500> I'm<00:01:13.799> not

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
is at one point 3 gigahertz so I'm not

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.070 
is at one point 3 gigahertz so I'm not
sure<00:01:14.010> how<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.490> will<00:01:14.670> impact<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:15.509> actual

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
sure how this will impact the actual

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.679 
sure how this will impact the actual
tablet<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.920> its<00:01:17.250> functionality<00:01:17.820> if<00:01:18.210> it'll

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
tablet and its functionality if it'll

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.570 
tablet and its functionality if it'll
make<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.990> really<00:01:19.259> really<00:01:19.470> quick<00:01:19.710> but<00:01:20.310> we'll

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
make it really really quick but we'll

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.700 
make it really really quick but we'll
see<00:01:20.759> how<00:01:20.790> tool<00:01:21.210> quad-core<00:01:21.840> processors<00:01:22.409> run

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
see how tool quad-core processors run

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.920 
see how tool quad-core processors run
for<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.549> we've<00:01:24.000> got<00:01:24.030> an<00:01:24.240> 8<00:01:24.390> megapixel

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
for it and we've got an 8 megapixel

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.630 
for it and we've got an 8 megapixel
camera<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.500> back<00:01:25.710> as<00:01:25.979> well<00:01:26.220> as<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.400> 2

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
megapixel up front 2 gigs of ram and

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.080 
megapixel up front 2 gigs of ram and
8200<00:01:30.540> milliamps<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.049> battery<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:32.250> that's<00:01:32.820> all

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
8200 milliamps of battery so that's all

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.149 
8200 milliamps of battery so that's all
the<00:01:33.270> boring<00:01:33.540> specs<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.650> now<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:34.860> gets<00:01:34.979> it

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
the boring specs so now this gets it

one of the stereo speakers so this has

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.339 
one of the stereo speakers so this has
two<00:04:00.729> of<00:04:00.849> those<00:04:01.030> and<00:04:01.329> they<00:04:01.689> come<00:04:01.900> out<00:04:01.989> on<00:04:02.049> the

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
two of those and they come out on the

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:03.420 
two of those and they come out on the

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
sides which is pretty interesting

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.670 
sides which is pretty interesting
because<00:04:03.729> we<00:04:04.030> typically<00:04:04.359> see<00:04:04.599> them<00:04:04.780> if<00:04:05.019> it's<00:04:05.590> a

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
because we typically see them if it's a

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.679 
because we typically see them if it's a
stereo<00:04:06.040> speaker<00:04:06.189> where<00:04:06.519> two<00:04:06.879> sides<00:04:07.120> you

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:07.689 
stereo speaker where two sides you

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:09.119 
stereo speaker where two sides you
usually<00:04:07.810> see<00:04:08.079> them<00:04:08.259> in<00:04:08.590> the<00:04:08.709> front

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:09.129 
usually see them in the front

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:10.679 
usually see them in the front
blasting<00:04:09.669> towards<00:04:10.030> you<00:04:10.180> so<00:04:10.359> these<00:04:10.449> are<00:04:10.569> going

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:10.689 
blasting towards you so these are going

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:12.599 
blasting towards you so these are going
to<00:04:10.750> be<00:04:10.840> coming<00:04:11.109> on<00:04:11.229> out<00:04:11.769> on<00:04:12.129> the<00:04:12.250> left<00:04:12.430> and
