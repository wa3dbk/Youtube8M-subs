00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
know I think the best thing you

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.810 
know I think the best thing you
do<00:04:25.180> is<00:04:25.510> communicate<00:04:25.810> and<00:04:26.440> I<00:04:26.889> think<00:04:27.400> that<00:04:27.520> they

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
do is communicate and I think that they

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.370 
do is communicate and I think that they
both<00:04:28.060> are<00:04:28.300> good<00:04:28.450> communicators<00:04:29.170> good

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
both are good communicators good

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.770 
both are good communicators good
effective<00:04:29.770> communicators<00:04:30.400> but<00:04:31.210> I<00:04:31.270> think<00:04:31.570> that

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
effective communicators but I think that

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.920 
effective communicators but I think that
there<00:04:32.200> is<00:04:32.610> with<00:04:33.610> communication<00:04:34.270> there's<00:04:34.630> more

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
there is with communication there's more

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.930 
there is with communication there's more
trust<00:04:35.260> and<00:04:35.710> so<00:04:36.040> I'd<00:04:36.130> say<00:04:36.340> to<00:04:36.400> them<00:04:36.550> to<00:04:36.790> always

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
trust and so I'd say to them to always

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.790 
trust and so I'd say to them to always
whether<00:04:37.360> you're<00:04:37.570> happy<00:04:37.900> or<00:04:38.050> sad<00:04:38.260> to<00:04:38.500> talk<00:04:38.680> to

whether you're happy or sad to talk to

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.260 
whether you're happy or sad to talk to
each<00:04:38.919> other<00:04:39.070> about<00:04:39.190> it<00:04:39.430> and<00:04:39.550> never<00:04:39.730> hold<00:04:40.060> back

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
each other about it and never hold back

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
if I have a problem it's compounded

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:56.970 
if I have a problem it's compounded

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
same industry so it's very tough to kind

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
look back and not feel biased but we

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.350 
look back and not feel biased but we
also<00:05:05.830> being<00:05:06.310> in<00:05:06.430> the<00:05:06.520> same<00:05:06.700> industry<00:05:06.970> we<00:05:07.210> also

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
also being in the same industry we also

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.880 
also being in the same industry we also
really<00:05:07.690> support<00:05:08.080> each<00:05:08.140> other<00:05:08.350> too<00:05:08.560> and<00:05:08.770> nobody

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
really support each other too and nobody

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.260 
really support each other too and nobody
could<00:05:09.100> understand<00:05:09.610> it<00:05:09.700> the<00:05:09.790> way<00:05:09.820> that<00:05:09.910> we<00:05:10.060> do

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
could understand it the way that we do

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.270 
could understand it the way that we do
and<00:05:10.960> how<00:05:11.110> difficult<00:05:11.320> can<00:05:11.620> it<00:05:11.650> be<00:05:11.770> sometimes<00:05:12.190> to

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
and how difficult can it be sometimes to

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.040 
and how difficult can it be sometimes to
where<00:05:12.580> the<00:05:12.940> schedules<00:05:13.330> can<00:05:13.480> be<00:05:13.510> different<00:05:13.930> and

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
where the schedules can be different and

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.600 
where the schedules can be different and
maybe<00:05:14.200> there'll<00:05:14.440> be<00:05:14.470> weeks<00:05:15.040> where<00:05:15.340> you<00:05:15.430> don't

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
maybe there'll be weeks where you don't

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.080 
maybe there'll be weeks where you don't
even<00:05:15.700> see<00:05:15.970> each<00:05:16.090> other<00:05:16.300> it's<00:05:17.190> hard<00:05:18.190> it's

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
even see each other it's hard it's

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.520 
even see each other it's hard it's
definitely<00:05:19.510> the<00:05:19.630> sacrifice<00:05:20.080> that's<00:05:20.260> why<00:05:20.380> not

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
definitely the sacrifice that's why not

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.750 
definitely the sacrifice that's why not
everybody<00:05:20.800> can<00:05:21.070> do<00:05:21.190> this<00:05:21.340> because<00:05:21.490> we<00:05:21.729> are

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
everybody can do this because we are

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.430 
everybody can do this because we are
away<00:05:22.030> from<00:05:22.270> each<00:05:22.330> other<00:05:22.450> our<00:05:22.720> families<00:05:23.139> so

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
away from each other our families so

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.129 
away from each other our families so
much<00:05:23.880> talk<00:05:24.880> about<00:05:25.090> competition<00:05:25.479> with<00:05:26.050> the

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 
much talk about competition with the

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:27.540 
much talk about competition with the
Divas<00:05:26.470> because<00:05:26.770> I<00:05:26.830> always<00:05:26.979> think<00:05:27.130> obviously

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
Divas because I always think obviously

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.040 
Divas because I always think obviously
there's<00:05:28.000> some<00:05:28.180> competition<00:05:28.450> with<00:05:28.810> the<00:05:28.900> guys

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
there's some competition with the guys

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.420 
there's some competition with the guys
but<00:05:29.350> to<00:05:29.470> me<00:05:29.590> it<00:05:29.770> always<00:05:29.890> seems<00:05:30.130> a<00:05:30.190> little<00:05:30.250> bit

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
but to me it always seems a little bit

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.760 
but to me it always seems a little bit
more<00:05:30.460> fiercer<00:05:31.000> with<00:05:31.450> the<00:05:31.630> Divas<00:05:32.080> is<00:05:32.440> that<00:05:32.590> true

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
more fiercer with the Divas is that true

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.020 
more fiercer with the Divas is that true
if<00:05:33.010> you<00:05:33.160> couldn't<00:05:33.370> survive<00:05:33.610> the<00:05:33.760> Divas<00:05:34.000> locker

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
if you couldn't survive the Divas locker

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.340 
if you couldn't survive the Divas locker
room<00:05:34.450> you<00:05:34.600> can<00:05:34.750> pretty<00:05:34.930> much<00:05:35.050> survive

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
room you can pretty much survive

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.950 
room you can pretty much survive
anything<00:05:36.070> and<00:05:36.280> I<00:05:36.310> think<00:05:36.370> the<00:05:36.640> Divas<00:05:37.000> if<00:05:37.390> you

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
anything and I think the Divas if you

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.719 
anything and I think the Divas if you
look<00:05:38.110> at<00:05:38.260> a<00:05:38.290> show<00:05:38.650> Monday<00:05:39.220> Night<00:05:39.370> Raw<00:05:39.400> for

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 
look at a show Monday Night Raw for

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:43.020 
look at a show Monday Night Raw for
example<00:05:40.180> there's<00:05:40.450> 8<00:05:40.990> to<00:05:41.200> 10<00:05:41.410> matches<00:05:42.030> there's

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
example there's 8 to 10 matches there's

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.029 
example there's 8 to 10 matches there's
only<00:05:43.210> one<00:05:43.510> divas<00:05:43.930> match<00:05:44.080> so<00:05:44.470> it's<00:05:44.740> gonna<00:05:44.890> be

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 
only one divas match so it's gonna be

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:47.940 
only one divas match so it's gonna be
