00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.220
 Hi everyone, who is this teacher? 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.290
 raquel in the footsteps of the disciplines of 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.080
 integrated clinical dentistry of 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.000
 Catholic University of Brasilia 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.219
 giving continuity to the theme of the classes 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.890
 we will talk today about the 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.720
 photoactivation techniques videos 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.330
 previous we commented on the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.849
 importance of using the 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.429
 incremental insertion to ensure 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.630
 best possible results for our 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.700
 restorations 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.500
 but to understand this matter is 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.070
 necessary to discuss and understand the 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.610
 phase concepts for gel point gel and 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.040
 phase at the beginning of the reaction of 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.870
 polymerization the tensions arising from 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.789
 are dissipated by the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.940
 deformation of the composite resin 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.379
 mainly on free surfaces in 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.620
 direction to the avenues 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.109
 this information is made possible by the 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.600
 mobility that molecules present 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.739
 during the initial phase of the reaction 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.690
 phase for jean 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.820
 from the moment the 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.610
 complexity of polymer heads 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.159
 prevents the molecular repositioning that 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.590
 is the gel point the composite is no longer 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.420
 able to undergo deformation without 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.080
 internal stresses occur 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.439
 the phase per jel occurs from point g or 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.210
 until the end of the polymerization reaction 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:27.659
 during this phase the entire contraction is 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.729
 stress accompanied by the literature 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.979
 respect to this theme is scarce and 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.810
 controversies about the real advantages of 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.270
 use these techniques 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.970
 some research has shown that 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.970
 polymerization techniques can reduce 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.369
 the final stress prolonging the phase 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.829
 projel while in other studies 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.049
 there are differences or even 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.090
 suggest that the conversion rate can be 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.149
 reduced when these are used 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.369
 methods of polymerization and thus the 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.369
 more diverse techniques are accepted 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.890
 among them we highlight the uniform 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.290
 continues where light intensity is 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.960
 kept constant from the beginning to the 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.830
 are generally used if 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.830
 maximum power of curing already 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.140
 in the technique of steps the emission of light 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.780
 low intensity during the first 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.550
 seconds passing the maximum intensity and 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.570
 remaining until the end of the 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.030
 process 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.890
 this variation of intensity can be 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.260
 obtained by programming and some 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.120
 or by moving away from the 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.250
 The mouthpiece entered the surface of the 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.510
 restoration which can be done in 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.030
 any appliance 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.800
 some studies argue that this method 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.660
 promotes better integration of 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.760
 imagine restorations in the technique of 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.910
 ramp the intensity increases 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.410
 progressively to the maximum and 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:54.780
 is maintained until the end of pollination 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.390
 already the technique of late pulse is made a 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.000
 quick initial activation of 3 to 5 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.130
 seconds at low intensity and in 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.490
 followed by an interval of a few minutes 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.260
 after a second activation with 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.060
 high intensity for a while 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.790
 to ensure adequate polymerization 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:15.030
 of material 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.980
 Finally we have the flashing technique 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.860
 is a method that alternates moments with 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.200
 lights without light in the same intensity 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.870
 some studies argue that the periods 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.840
 no light to promote a reduction in the rate of 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.300
 polymerization which may be responsible for 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.790
 by the reduction of stress and the 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.790
 probability of adhesion preservation 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.950
 some light curing allows the 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.650
 power adjustment and 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.050
 photoactivation for example in this video 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.390
 we can observe that each one sells us 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:51.150
 corresponds to 5 seconds of incidence 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.920
 light and the different techniques that 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.830
 can be used with the same 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.690
 appliance 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:00.390
 so it is important that you have a 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.190
 radiometer so that you know the power 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.040
 of each of the 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.470
 photopolymerizer as well as to know 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.470
 about the effectiveness of each of them 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.090
 there is no exact calibration between 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.280
 languages ​​carrying the same 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.260
 light curing can present 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.940
 different values ​​when tested in 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.549
 different from shoulders 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.490
 however the radiohead crosses are the 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:26.640
 the only tools available for this 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.750
 type of evaluation, although the data did not 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.470
 be nothing 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.880
 did well 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.630
 these were the references used 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:39.030
 in this video then doubts 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.380
 if they have any directions for us at 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.390
 any of these youtube channel
