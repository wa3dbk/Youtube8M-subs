article<00:00:14.730> be<00:00:14.820> in<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:14.969> description<00:00:15.389> they

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
article be in the description they

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.269 
article be in the description they
basically<00:00:15.780> brought<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.289> idea<00:00:16.590> that<00:00:16.980> fallout

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
basically brought the idea that fallout

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.920 
basically brought the idea that fallout
3<00:00:17.550> could<00:00:17.699> be<00:00:17.730> modded<00:00:18.090> enough<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.539> look<00:00:18.720> like<00:00:18.900> a

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
3 could be modded enough to look like a

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.779 
3 could be modded enough to look like a
current<00:00:19.320> game<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.740> so<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.220> thought<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:20.670> was

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
current game and so I thought that was

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:21.260 
current game and so I thought that was
awesome

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
awesome

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.790 
awesome
and<00:00:21.359> basically<00:00:21.660> they<00:00:21.990> suggested<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.500> bunch<00:00:22.680> of

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
and basically they suggested a bunch of

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.410 
and basically they suggested a bunch of
mods<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.130> put<00:00:23.310> them<00:00:23.430> all<00:00:23.580> together<00:00:23.730> I'm<00:00:24.090> at<00:00:24.269> my
