welcome to the introduction to the new

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.990 
welcome to the introduction to the new
cortex<00:00:02.879> of<00:00:03.030> 5<00:00:03.240> interface<00:00:03.720> and<00:00:03.990> g5<00:00:05.000> we're

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
cortex of 5 interface and g5 we're

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.309 
cortex of 5 interface and g5 we're
really<00:00:06.210> excited<00:00:06.540> about<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:06.990> release<00:00:07.140> of

really excited about the release of
these<00:00:07.589> new<00:00:07.740> features<00:00:07.950> which<00:00:08.429> include<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.880> new

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
these new features which include the new

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.620 
these new features which include the new

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
cortex a5 interface and g5 with g5 were

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.720 
cortex a5 interface and g5 with g5 were
really<00:00:12.960> taking<00:00:13.200> custom<00:00:13.769> configuration<00:00:14.580> and

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
really taking custom configuration and

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.390 
really taking custom configuration and
set<00:00:14.940> up<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.330> next<00:00:15.509> level<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:16.039> g5<00:00:17.039> we've

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
set up to the next level and g5 we've

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.429 
set up to the next level and g5 we've
significantly<00:00:17.720> enhanced<00:00:18.720> not<00:00:18.900> only<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.289> ease

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
significantly enhanced not only the ease

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.800 
significantly enhanced not only the ease
of<00:00:19.470> configuring<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.340> cortex<00:00:20.789> but<00:00:21.510> we've<00:00:21.630> also

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
of configuring the cortex but we've also

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.540 
of configuring the cortex but we've also
created<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.439> ability<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.980> really<00:00:23.279> customize
