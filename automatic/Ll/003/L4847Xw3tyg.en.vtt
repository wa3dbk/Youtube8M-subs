00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.190 
take this truck off the road and I
rather<00:01:32.460> than<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> square<00:01:32.970> an<00:01:33.119> oval<00:01:33.420> or<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.750> round

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:03.190 
seen together anywhere else as a molded

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.920 
seen together anywhere else as a molded
piece<00:07:03.400> so<00:07:03.520> it's<00:07:03.640> very<00:07:03.850> durable<00:07:04.030> and<00:07:04.330> not<00:07:04.720> only

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:04.930 
piece so it's very durable and not only

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.780

is<00:07:04.990> a<00:07:05.050> durable<00:07:05.230> but<00:07:05.440> it's<00:07:06.010> also<00:07:06.220> a<00:07:06.370> leak<00:07:06.580> proof

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:06.790 
is a durable but it's also a leak proof

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:09.000 
is a durable but it's also a leak proof
so<00:07:07.080> another<00:07:08.080> good<00:07:08.230> feature<00:07:08.350> that<00:07:08.620> this<00:07:08.770> box

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.010 
so another good feature that this box

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.560 
so another good feature that this box
here<00:07:09.130> that<00:07:09.310> slides<00:07:09.400> into<00:07:09.700> is<00:07:10.180> actually

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:10.570 
here that slides into is actually

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.870 
here that slides into is actually
insulated<00:07:11.020> so<00:07:11.200> this<00:07:11.830> is<00:07:11.950> a<00:07:11.980> 1.6<00:07:12.550> gallon

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:12.880
