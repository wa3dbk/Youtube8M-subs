00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
good and as far as shedding I have

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.550

gotten<00:02:58.240> about<00:02:58.330> six<00:02:58.660> or<00:02:58.810> seven<00:02:59.050> strands<00:02:59.320> to

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
gotten about six or seven strands to

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.770

shed<00:02:59.830> when<00:03:00.490> I<00:03:00.520> wash<00:03:00.880> the<00:03:01.150> hair<00:03:01.330> but<00:03:01.660> that's

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
shed when I wash the hair but that's

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.870 
shed when I wash the hair but that's
because<00:03:01.990> I<00:03:02.200> use<00:03:02.350> my<00:03:02.380> cattle<00:03:02.920> brush<00:03:03.100> when<00:03:03.790> the

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
because I use my cattle brush when the

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.440 
because I use my cattle brush when the
hair<00:03:04.030> is<00:03:04.060> wet

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
hair is wet

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.090 
hair is wet
I<00:03:04.630> run<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:05.050> conditioner<00:03:05.530> through<00:03:05.710> it<00:03:05.890> and<00:03:06.040> I

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
I run the conditioner through it and I

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.790 
I run the conditioner through it and I
use<00:03:06.280> my<00:03:06.460> brush<00:03:06.730> to<00:03:07.000> brush<00:03:07.210> all<00:03:07.810> of<00:03:08.440> the<00:03:08.560> hair

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
use my brush to brush all of the hair

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.160 
use my brush to brush all of the hair
and<00:03:09.160> that<00:03:09.700> way<00:03:09.880> if<00:03:09.940> anything<00:03:10.420> is<00:03:10.630> gonna<00:03:11.140> I

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
and that way if anything is gonna I

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.500 
and that way if anything is gonna I
get<00:03:11.500> it<00:03:11.590> out<00:03:11.680> at<00:03:11.890> that<00:03:12.040> time<00:03:12.070> while<00:03:13.060> it's<00:03:13.270> wet<00:03:13.480> I

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
get it out at that time while it's wet I

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.690 
get it out at that time while it's wet I
scrunch<00:03:13.960> it<00:03:14.140> up<00:03:14.260> and<00:03:14.890> kind<00:03:15.160> of<00:03:15.250> get<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.520> wave

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
scrunch it up and kind of get the wave

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.940 
scrunch it up and kind of get the wave
that<00:03:16.000> I<00:03:16.030> want<00:03:16.390> and<00:03:16.720> I<00:03:17.020> leave<00:03:17.290> it<00:03:17.470> overnight<00:03:17.800> to

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
that I want and I leave it overnight to

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.790 
that I want and I leave it overnight to
dry<00:03:18.310> just<00:03:18.790> to<00:03:18.910> air<00:03:19.150> dry<00:03:19.450> so<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:20.290> next<00:03:20.470> day<00:03:20.650> when

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
dry just to air dry so the next day when

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.550 
dry just to air dry so the next day when
I<00:03:20.860> put<00:03:21.130> my<00:03:21.160> unit<00:03:21.610> on<00:03:21.730> it's<00:03:22.210> in<00:03:22.630> this<00:03:23.080> texture

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
I put my unit on it's in this texture

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.600 
I put my unit on it's in this texture
right<00:03:23.710> here<00:03:23.950> and<00:03:24.070> I<00:03:24.130> don't<00:03:24.160> have<00:03:24.400> to<00:03:24.520> do

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
right here and I don't have to do

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.790 
right here and I don't have to do
anything<00:03:24.850> else<00:03:25.180> to<00:03:25.540> it<00:03:25.720> and<00:03:26.140> I<00:03:26.230> usually<00:03:26.380> can

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
anything else to it and I usually can

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.800 
anything else to it and I usually can
leave<00:03:26.980> it<00:03:27.130> like<00:03:27.250> this<00:03:27.280> for<00:03:27.700> four<00:03:28.330> to<00:03:28.420> five<00:03:28.600> days

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
leave it like this for four to five days

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.330 
leave it like this for four to five days
without<00:03:29.080> touching<00:03:29.770> it

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
without touching it

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.600 
without touching it
now<00:03:30.970> this<00:03:31.300> texture<00:03:31.900> is<00:03:31.930> fairly<00:03:32.920> coarse<00:03:33.250> it's

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
now this texture is fairly coarse it's

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.000 
now this texture is fairly coarse it's
not<00:03:33.910> you<00:03:34.450> know<00:03:34.570> it's<00:03:34.750> not<00:03:34.810> it's<00:03:35.170> fine

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
not you know it's not it's fine

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.400 
not you know it's not it's fine
but<00:03:36.370> it<00:03:36.490> has<00:03:37.030> a<00:03:37.060> little<00:03:37.450> bit<00:03:37.510> of<00:03:37.630> coarseness<00:03:38.110> to

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
but it has a little bit of coarseness to

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.750 
but it has a little bit of coarseness to
it<00:03:38.590> so<00:03:38.980> if<00:03:39.040> you're<00:03:39.100> trying<00:03:39.250> to<00:03:39.370> figure<00:03:39.520> out<00:03:39.610> how

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
it so if you're trying to figure out how

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.490 
it so if you're trying to figure out how
many<00:03:39.820> bundles<00:03:40.180> you<00:03:40.480> probably<00:03:40.840> should<00:03:41.110> get<00:03:41.230> I

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
many bundles you probably should get I

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.890 
many bundles you probably should get I
would<00:03:42.190> say<00:03:42.400> three<00:03:42.760> if<00:03:43.030> you<00:03:43.210> don't<00:03:43.450> want<00:03:43.720> this

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
would say three if you don't want this

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.950 
would say three if you don't want this
huge<00:03:44.530> amount<00:03:45.220> of<00:03:45.460> hair<00:03:45.700> all<00:03:45.970> over<00:03:46.000> your<00:03:46.300> head<00:03:46.630> I

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:46.960 
huge amount of hair all over your head I

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.350 
huge amount of hair all over your head I
think<00:03:47.830> three<00:03:48.130> is<00:03:48.160> enough<00:03:48.730> especially<00:03:49.300> if

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
think three is enough especially if

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.550 
think three is enough especially if
you're<00:03:49.480> going<00:03:49.630> with<00:03:49.840> something<00:03:50.080> of<00:03:50.350> this

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
you're going with something of this

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.680 
you're going with something of this
length<00:03:51.010> like<00:03:51.730> I<00:03:51.820> said<00:03:52.000> I<00:03:52.030> have<00:03:52.270> three<00:03:52.480> bundles

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
length like I said I have three bundles

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.600 
length like I said I have three bundles

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
have a closure I still would only use

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.930 
have a closure I still would only use
three<00:03:56.530> bundles<00:03:56.950> because<00:03:57.040> the<00:03:57.280> hair<00:03:57.490> is<00:03:57.520> kind

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
three bundles because the hair is kind

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.690 
three bundles because the hair is kind
of<00:03:58.000> big<00:03:58.290> um<00:04:01.590> of<00:04:02.590> course<00:04:03.010> if<00:04:03.220> you<00:04:03.340> go<00:04:03.520> with

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
of big um of course if you go with

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.150 
of big um of course if you go with
something<00:04:03.940> longer<00:04:04.420> you<00:04:04.930> might<00:04:05.260> want<00:04:05.620> to<00:04:05.710> think

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
something longer you might want to think

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.710 
something longer you might want to think
about<00:04:06.310> adding<00:04:06.640> another<00:04:07.030> bundle<00:04:07.300> but<00:04:07.630> if

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
about adding another bundle but if

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.330 
about adding another bundle but if
you're<00:04:07.900> going<00:04:08.080> with<00:04:08.320> 18<00:04:08.800> inches<00:04:09.130> or<00:04:09.310> shorter

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
you're going with 18 inches or shorter

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.390 
you're going with 18 inches or shorter
like<00:04:09.880> what<00:04:10.090> I<00:04:10.120> have<00:04:10.450> three<00:04:11.350> bundles<00:04:11.650> should

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
like what I have three bundles should

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.040 
like what I have three bundles should
most<00:04:12.640> certainly<00:04:12.760> be<00:04:13.240> enough<00:04:13.480> because<00:04:13.900> the

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
most certainly be enough because the

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.130 
most certainly be enough because the
