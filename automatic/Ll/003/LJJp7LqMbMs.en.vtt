00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530 
so now we're going to take a physical

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.350 
so now we're going to take a physical
look<00:00:01.949> at<00:00:02.129> the<00:00:02.250> actual<00:00:02.550> scale<00:00:02.820> out<00:00:03.030> how<00:00:03.179> it's

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
look at the actual scale out how it's

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.190 
look at the actual scale out how it's
written<00:00:03.510> out<00:00:03.750> in<00:00:03.780> tab<00:00:04.200> and<00:00:05.420> how<00:00:06.420> we<00:00:06.480> read<00:00:06.839> is

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
written out in tab and how we read is

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.110 
written out in tab and how we read is
this<00:00:07.500> is<00:00:07.620> our<00:00:07.740> top<00:00:07.950> string<00:00:08.250> going<00:00:08.610> down<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:09.000> our

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
this is our top string going down to our

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.820 
this is our top string going down to our
lowest<00:00:09.480> string<00:00:09.719> right<00:00:09.929> here's<00:00:10.200> our<00:00:10.349> e<00:00:10.500> string

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
lowest string right here's our e string

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.520 
lowest string right here's our e string
right<00:00:10.980> here<00:00:11.040> and<00:00:11.509> I<00:00:12.509> wrote<00:00:12.540> down<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:13.080> actual

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
right here and I wrote down the actual

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.230 
right here and I wrote down the actual
frets<00:00:13.799> that<00:00:13.920> we<00:00:14.130> play<00:00:14.309> for<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.580> scale<00:00:14.880> so<00:00:15.120> you

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
frets that we play for the scale so you

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.140 
frets that we play for the scale so you
have<00:00:15.890> B<00:00:16.890> flats<00:00:17.160> right<00:00:17.400> here<00:00:17.670> on<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.940> third

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
have B flats right here on the third

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.849 
have B flats right here on the third
string<00:00:18.480> first<00:00:18.869> fret<00:00:19.050> right<00:00:19.380> so<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:19.650> put<00:00:19.830> a

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
string first fret right so I put a

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.980 
string first fret right so I put a
square<00:00:20.100> around<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.730> then<00:00:21.600> we<00:00:21.750> have<00:00:21.900> it

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
square around it and then we have it

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.220 
square around it and then we have it
again<00:00:22.199> on<00:00:22.350> our<00:00:22.439> third<00:00:23.539> fret<00:00:24.539> on<00:00:24.720> our<00:00:25.019> top

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.019 
again on our third fret on our top
string<00:00:25.529> so<00:00:25.800> we<00:00:25.920> have<00:00:26.390> 13<00:00:27.390> open<00:00:28.170> 13<00:00:28.800> open<00:00:29.340> 23

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
string so we have 13 open 13 open 23

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.590 
string so we have 13 open 13 open 23
right<00:00:30.300> remember<00:00:30.539> if<00:00:30.720> we<00:00:30.779> play<00:00:31.019> that<00:00:31.940> 13<00:00:32.940> open

write down and you'll find this tab on
the<00:00:44.640> internet<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.330> will<00:00:45.450> be<00:00:45.570> written<00:00:45.720> out<00:00:45.900> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
the internet and will be written out the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.500 
the internet and will be written out the
exact<00:00:46.350> same<00:00:46.560> way<00:00:46.740> its<00:00:47.250> first<00:00:47.520> position<00:00:48.000> your<00:00:48.330> B

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
exact same way its first position your B

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.720 
exact same way its first position your B
flat<00:00:48.660> major<00:00:48.840> scale<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.470> again<00:00:50.190> you're<00:00:50.610> in<00:00:50.670> a

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
flat major scale and again you're in a

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.370 
flat major scale and again you're in a
number<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.360> these<00:00:51.480> numbers<00:00:51.540> I<00:00:51.989> put<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:52.260> the

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:52.380 
number it so these numbers I put on the

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.750 
number it so these numbers I put on the
top<00:00:52.590> or<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.860> actual<00:00:53.070> degrees<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.700> scale

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
top or the actual degrees of the scale

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.400 
top or the actual degrees of the scale
one<00:00:54.300> two<00:00:54.810> three<00:00:55.350> four<00:00:55.739> five<00:00:55.800> six<00:00:56.250> seven<00:00:56.790> one

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
one two three four five six seven one

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.619 
one two three four five six seven one
and<00:00:58.410> now<00:00:58.559> if<00:00:58.800> we<00:00:58.950> look<00:00:58.980> at<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.550> actual<00:01:00.000> pitch

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
and now if we look at the actual pitch

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.530 
and now if we look at the actual pitch
names<00:01:01.080> which<00:01:01.830> starts<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.220> D<00:01:02.580> flat<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.239> we<00:01:03.420> go

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
names which starts on D flat and we go

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.750 
names which starts on D flat and we go
up<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.780> alphabet<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.860> beef<00:01:05.190> let<00:01:05.400> has<00:01:05.489> three

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
up the alphabet so beef let has three

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.490 
up the alphabet so beef let has three
flats<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.270> you'll<00:01:06.390> see<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.630> but<00:01:07.140> once

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
flats and you'll see that but once

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.680 
flats and you'll see that but once
you're<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.740> b-flat<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.729> chords<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.300> given

you're in b-flat the chords that given

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.090 
you're in b-flat the chords that given
to<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.869> already<00:01:10.200> have<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.470> flats<00:01:10.710> there<00:01:10.920> so

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
to you already have the flats there so

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.969 
to you already have the flats there so
you<00:01:11.190> have<00:01:11.280> B<00:01:11.430> flat<00:01:11.670> C<00:01:12.030> D<00:01:12.920> E<00:01:13.920> flat<00:01:14.610> F<00:01:15.119> G<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:16.290> B<00:01:16.950> flat

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
you have B flat C D E flat F G a B flat

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.780 
you have B flat C D E flat F G a B flat
so<00:01:17.550> one<00:01:17.850> two<00:01:18.090> three<00:01:18.540> four<00:01:18.930> five<00:01:19.259> six<00:01:19.320> seven<00:01:20.040> so

an<00:02:02.310> E<00:02:02.460> flat<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:03.000> can<00:02:03.210> go<00:02:03.770> b<00:02:04.770> c<00:02:05.340> d<00:02:05.729> e<00:02:06.330> flat<00:02:07.200> right

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
an E flat I can go b c d e flat right

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.710 
an E flat I can go b c d e flat right
there<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:07.890> there's<00:02:08.070> my<00:02:08.220> e<00:02:08.280> flat<00:02:08.580> right<00:02:08.820> b<00:02:09.090> c<00:02:09.390> d<00:02:09.420> e
