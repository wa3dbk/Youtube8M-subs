 knit pattern raspberry 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:19.890
 for this on the spokes we dial loops 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:24.449
 multiple of four + two edge 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:30.330
 loop I scored 30 loops start 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:35.640
 knit the first row of the first edge loop 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:40.550
 we are shooting and from one loop we are with you 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:47.210
 knit 3 loops for the back wall 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:54.890
 1 face loop and face loop 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:54.890
 Loop lowered 3 purl loops 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:10.420
 and repeat our report to the end of the row of 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:13.900
 we knit 3 loops on one loop and 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:20.920
 front wall behind the back wall and 3 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:25.570
 purl loops 2 row first edge 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:29.410
 the loop we are shooting and tying 3 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:33.520
 loops together 1 purl loop 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:42.460
 knit for the front wall 3 loops 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:44.640
 together 1 purl loop 3 facial 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.640
 loops

 again not before work 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:02:08.729

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:10.599
 facial so in their knit to the end of the row 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.400
 3 row 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:23.290
 in the first edge loop remove and knit 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:28.950
 3 purl loops and now 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:34.420
 from one loop we knit 3 facial 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:43.269
 nakid and facial loop and repeat our 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:46.780
 report to the end of row 3 purl and out 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:54.810
 one mm loop we tie 3 face wraps 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:03:01.170
 and front loop 4 row first edge 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:01.170
 remove and knit 3 facial loops 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:10.120
 knitted for front wall 3 facial 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:15.030
 loops thread before work and knit 3 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.150
 loops together 1 purl loop and 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.730
 let down 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:28.889
 and repeat our report until the end of row 3 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:32.340
 front loops and 3 loops together 1 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:32.340
 purl loop 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:10.510
 the last edge we have wrong 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:14.540
 we knit with you 4 rows of our pattern 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:19.100
 raspberry now we will knit repeating with
