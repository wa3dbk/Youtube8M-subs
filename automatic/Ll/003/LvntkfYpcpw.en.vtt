00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
leaves if you can see I've really close

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.240 
leaves if you can see I've really close
up<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.840> know<00:01:33.930> view<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.409> telly<00:01:34.829> texture<00:01:35.159> on

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
up you know view of the telly texture on

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.980 
up you know view of the telly texture on
the<00:01:35.280> right<00:01:35.460> there<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.880> as<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.270> can<00:01:36.360> see<00:01:36.390> it's

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
the right there and as you can see it's

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.450 
the right there and as you can see it's
it's<00:01:37.320> really<00:01:37.650> really<00:01:37.799> different<00:01:37.950> i<00:01:38.159> hope<00:01:38.310> all

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
it's really really different i hope all

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.499 
it's really really different i hope all
the<00:01:38.579> textures<00:01:38.909> let's<00:01:39.060> take<00:01:39.150> this<00:01:39.270> up<00:01:39.420> close

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
the textures let's take this up close

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.480 
the textures let's take this up close
and<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.259> can<00:01:40.320> also<00:01:40.500> see<00:01:40.710> armor<00:01:41.009> looks<00:01:41.130> almost

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
and you can also see armor looks almost

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.770 
and you can also see armor looks almost
exactly<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:42.030> same<00:01:42.119> but<00:01:42.299> again<00:01:42.600> more

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
difference which is always nice as I've

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.560 
difference which is always nice as I've
said<00:02:25.560> about<00:02:25.740> five<00:02:26.130> times<00:02:26.340> in<00:02:26.550> this<00:02:26.610> video<00:02:26.880> but

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
said about five times in this video but

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.000 
said about five times in this video but
it<00:02:27.630> really<00:02:27.840> does<00:02:28.050> shrek<00:02:28.320> truth<00:02:28.590> this<00:02:28.740> video

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
it really does shrek truth this video

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.680 
it really does shrek truth this video
but<00:02:29.430> as<00:02:29.730> you<00:02:29.820> can<00:02:29.910> see<00:02:30.060> from<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.240> distance<00:02:30.270> the

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
but as you can see from a distance the

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.390 
but as you can see from a distance the
jungle<00:02:30.900> isn't<00:02:31.020> look<00:02:31.170> too<00:02:31.350> different<00:02:31.470> which<00:02:32.310> is

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
jungle isn't look too different which is

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.940 
jungle isn't look too different which is
nice<00:02:32.580> keeping<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.810> jungles<00:02:34.260> roughly<00:02:34.860> the

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
nice keeping the jungles roughly the

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.170 
nice keeping the jungles roughly the
same<00:02:35.130> it'd<00:02:35.430> be<00:02:35.610> nice<00:02:35.760> they're<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.000> little

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
same it'd be nice they're a little

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.850 
same it'd be nice they're a little
different<00:02:36.270> but<00:02:36.780> that<00:02:37.170> can<00:02:37.290> take<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.470> leave<00:02:37.650> away

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
different but that can take a leave away

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.790 
different but that can take a leave away
this<00:02:38.730> next<00:02:38.970> one<00:02:39.150> shows<00:02:39.390> a<00:02:39.720> waterfall<00:02:40.230> again

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
this next one shows a waterfall again

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.530 
this next one shows a waterfall again
the<00:02:41.070> water<00:02:41.220> looks<00:02:41.400> almost<00:02:41.580> identical<00:02:41.850> car

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
the water looks almost identical car

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.600 
the water looks almost identical car
looks<00:02:42.750> before<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:44.040> birch<00:02:44.190> trees<00:02:44.460> look

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
looks before the birch trees look

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.190 
looks before the birch trees look
identical<00:02:44.760> it's<00:02:45.270> just<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.540> Leafs<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:46.080> the

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
identical it's just the Leafs and the

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.810 
identical it's just the Leafs and the
grass<00:02:46.410> that<00:02:46.620> re<00:02:46.740> except<00:02:47.040> in<00:02:47.130> this<00:02:47.220> one<00:02:47.280> so<00:02:47.700> I

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
grass that re except in this one so I

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.160 
grass that re except in this one so I
guess<00:02:47.970> this<00:02:48.090> is<00:02:48.240> trying<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.570> show<00:02:48.690> it's<00:02:48.870> not

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
guess this is trying to show it's not

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.590 
guess this is trying to show it's not

this is what there's a couple of ones
they're<00:03:17.580> interesting<00:03:17.940> but<00:03:18.150> that's<00:03:18.270> the<00:03:18.600> one

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
they're interesting but that's the one

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
that really really strikes me as you

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.220 
that really really strikes me as you
know<00:03:20.490> when<00:03:20.640> I<00:03:20.670> must<00:03:20.970> have<00:03:21.150> as<00:03:21.840> well<00:03:21.990> as<00:03:22.110> that

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
know when I must have as well as that

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.380 
know when I must have as well as that
you<00:03:22.380> can<00:03:22.620> see<00:03:22.860> the<00:03:23.010> fire<00:03:23.220> they<00:03:23.550> looks<00:03:24.090> pretty

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
you can see the fire they looks pretty

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.610 
you can see the fire they looks pretty
much<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.570> same<00:03:24.720> I<00:03:25.140> can't<00:03:25.380> see<00:03:25.530> the

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
much the same I can't see the

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.530 
much the same I can't see the
differences<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.760> then<00:03:26.910> on<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.120> roof<00:03:27.300> you've

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
differences and then on the roof you've

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.540 
differences and then on the roof you've
got<00:03:27.690> a<00:03:27.720> nice<00:03:27.930> little<00:03:28.500> you<00:03:28.860> know<00:03:28.980> chandelier

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
got a nice little you know chandelier

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:30.590 
got a nice little you know chandelier
thing<00:03:29.790> that<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:30.060> can<00:03:30.180> still<00:03:30.420> do<00:03:30.480> in<00:03:30.540> the

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
thing that you can still do in the

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.510 
thing that you can still do in the
regular<00:03:30.840> mine<00:03:30.960> crop<00:03:31.200> but<00:03:31.380> looks<00:03:32.070> that<00:03:32.280> tiny

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
regular mine crop but looks that tiny

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.430 
regular mine crop but looks that tiny
bit<00:03:32.730> different<00:03:33.090> which<00:03:33.300> I<00:03:33.600> guess<00:03:34.050> that's<00:03:34.260> what

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
bit different which I guess that's what

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.630 
bit different which I guess that's what
the<00:03:34.500> whole<00:03:34.590> text<00:03:34.890> packs<00:03:35.070> is<00:03:35.220> about<00:03:35.370> as<00:03:35.520> I've

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
the whole text packs is about as I've

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.190 
the whole text packs is about as I've
said<00:03:35.790> before<00:03:35.850> so<00:03:36.240> finally<00:03:36.630> we<00:03:36.720> have<00:03:36.840> this<00:03:36.930> last

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
said before so finally we have this last

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.290 
said before so finally we have this last
one<00:03:37.440> which<00:03:38.130> is<00:03:38.160> actually<00:03:38.460> breaks<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.120> theme

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
one which is actually breaks the theme

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.060 
one which is actually breaks the theme
and<00:03:39.570> actually<00:03:39.810> almost<00:03:39.960> it<00:03:40.380> changes<00:03:40.740> things<00:03:40.890> a

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
and actually almost it changes things a

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.199 
and actually almost it changes things a
lot<00:03:41.250> because<00:03:41.460> you<00:03:41.580> can<00:03:41.700> see<00:03:41.850> the<00:03:41.940> network

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
lot because you can see the network

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.000 
lot because you can see the network
textures<00:03:42.570> have<00:03:42.690> really<00:03:42.870> changed<00:03:43.080> which<00:03:43.830> makes

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
textures have really changed which makes

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.260 
textures have really changed which makes
the<00:03:44.100> nerve<00:03:44.250> portrait<00:03:44.640> is<00:03:44.730> this<00:03:44.910> whole<00:03:45.060> new

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
the nerve portrait is this whole new

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.510 
the nerve portrait is this whole new
brand<00:03:45.600> new<00:03:45.690> thing<00:03:45.870> to<00:03:45.990> explore<00:03:46.350> like<00:03:46.620> I<00:03:47.100> guess

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
brand new thing to explore like I guess

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.820 
brand new thing to explore like I guess
they<00:03:47.670> are<00:03:47.790> still<00:03:48.000> the<00:03:48.150> same<00:03:48.300> idea<00:03:48.600> bits<00:03:48.870> I<00:03:49.170> know

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
they are still the same idea bits I know

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.170 
they are still the same idea bits I know
it's<00:03:49.980> different<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.490> that's<00:03:50.850> what<00:03:51.000> I<00:03:51.030> like

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
it's different and that's what I like

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.000 
it's different and that's what I like
