you'll see that with my away everything

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.250 
you'll see that with my away everything
has<00:02:10.910> been<00:02:11.060> changed<00:02:11.800> including<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:13.070> toggles

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260

notifications<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:16.490> settings

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
notifications and the settings

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.910 
notifications and the settings
everything<00:02:17.420> is<00:02:17.660> a<00:02:17.780> little<00:02:18.350> bit<00:02:18.440> different

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
everything is a little bit different

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.430 
everything is a little bit different
while<00:02:19.550> it<00:02:19.790> does<00:02:20.090> keep<00:02:20.540> a<00:02:20.780> lot<00:02:21.050> of<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.260> same

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
while it does keep a lot of the same

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.350 
while it does keep a lot of the same
stuff<00:02:21.800> so<00:02:22.540> this<00:02:23.540> is<00:02:23.720> still<00:02:23.930> compatible<00:02:24.650> with

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
stuff so this is still compatible with

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.140 
stuff so this is still compatible with
other<00:02:26.360> TouchWiz<00:02:27.320> based<00:02:27.610> kernels<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:28.760> stuff

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
other TouchWiz based kernels and stuff

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.060 
other TouchWiz based kernels and stuff
so<00:02:29.360> you<00:02:29.450> can<00:02:29.570> actually<00:02:29.690> install<00:02:30.170> bolt<00:02:30.620> karna

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
so you can actually install bolt karna

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.970 
so you can actually install bolt karna
and<00:02:31.280> or<00:02:31.700> clock<00:02:32.210> it<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.510> 1.9<00:02:33.170> gigahertz<00:02:33.560> this

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
and or clock it to 1.9 gigahertz this

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.900 
and or clock it to 1.9 gigahertz this
one<00:02:34.160> is<00:02:34.250> also<00:02:34.370> running<00:02:35.240> Note<00:02:35.780> 2<00:02:35.990> core<00:02:36.520> OC<00:02:37.520> so

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
one is also running Note 2 core OC so

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.240 
one is also running Note 2 core OC so
it's<00:02:38.180> one<00:02:38.390> running<00:02:38.810> at<00:02:38.900> 1.8<00:02:39.500> gigahertz<00:02:39.530> so

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
it's one running at 1.8 gigahertz so

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.520 
it's one running at 1.8 gigahertz so
it's<00:02:40.370> gonna<00:02:40.790> be<00:02:40.970> really<00:02:41.330> fast<00:02:41.720> and<00:02:41.930> it<00:02:42.080> runs

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
it's gonna be really fast and it runs

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.530 
it's gonna be really fast and it runs
really<00:02:42.860> fast<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:43.700> that<00:02:44.150> you<00:02:44.240> don't<00:02:44.330> actually

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
really fast and that you don't actually

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.410 
really fast and that you don't actually
have<00:02:44.750> to<00:02:45.130> insult<00:02:46.130> set<00:02:46.459> CPU<00:02:46.850> but<00:02:47.030> if<00:02:47.150> you<00:02:47.270> do

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
have to insult set CPU but if you do

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.770 
have to insult set CPU but if you do
install<00:02:47.690> it<00:02:47.900> he'll<00:02:48.350> be<00:02:48.380> set<00:02:48.650> at<00:02:48.800> 1.8<00:02:49.610> gigahertz

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
install it he'll be set at 1.8 gigahertz

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.150 
install it he'll be set at 1.8 gigahertz
you'll<00:02:50.780> still<00:02:51.080> get<00:02:51.230> pretty<00:02:51.560> good<00:02:51.770> battery

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160
