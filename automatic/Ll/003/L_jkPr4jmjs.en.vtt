00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.850
 Welcome to my name and on the day of 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.870
 today I will show you how 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.769
 and renew a bag 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.129
 It is very bag 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:18.430
 This is a bag that falls like the 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.430
 skin 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.710
 I will find as more or less so that 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.140
 have an idea of what it is that 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:31.000
 I want to say as well as why they fall 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:34.000
 this and it peels good I went to wash it 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.620
 very well with a brush you have to be 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.590
 with a brush to wash clothes and good you 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:45.300
 remove all fabric and basically what 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.300
 I will do will be to paint 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.440
 and how I'm going to paint it good I bought 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.320
 this watercolors that are painting for 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.040
 fabrics and an old brush that had a 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.740
 adjustment 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.740
 then that was basically 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.920
 and you want to add the 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:06.560
 sequins accessories I started to 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.009
 paint this part 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.280
 boredom so let's do things 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:15.259
 like those then because I have so 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.259
 little paint I have two colors but 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.870
 this one is over then I have 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.180
 so little painting what I do is 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.460
 pass the brochita through the places where 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.430
 casino 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.159
 I do not have where there is almost no painting 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.720
 then where the painting does not go and with 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.720
 the little finger I'm reinforcing 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.100
 I'm reinforcing so that everything is covered 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.100
 I think 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.890
 I believe that this is the best way to 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.890
 cope with depression 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:55.010
 so I dedicated myself to the task for this 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:58.640
 either because I'm going to paint and I have 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.300
 not be so pretty I think now is not 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.160
 Social 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.120
 and also because he had a long time without 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.120
 make him videos 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.880
 although I do it for fun 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.650
 and so 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.299
 it's like when crowned 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.200
 I'm concerned about not calling him 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:25.129
 depression 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:28.400
 touching has the title then I'm going to 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:32.290
 stop talking so much madness then 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.290
 good to me it stayed like this 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.319
 the second part that someone will play this 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.800
 video 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:46.420
 will be painting this part of here up 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.840
 will be painting this here in 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.700
 I know you 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.700
 and the inside part if you stay 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:59.810
 like a sun 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:03.319
 So I 've never used it because it got wet 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.950
 and how it was like leather but that leather 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.700
 synthetic 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.080
 It was damaged very fast 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:16.480
 can use it and what better than 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.480
 and following this line because it ends 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.300
 and this line has ended 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:25.010
 and now I'm going to continue with the line that 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:27.880
 enables the combination with purple 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.880
 so as to 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.090
 and water 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.230
 but I have to be careful careful light 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.230
 he takes care I do not know that I'm not going to lie 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.900
 a purple color 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.700
 the project because this scenario 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.970
 it's true 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.760
 this new stage when it dries 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:28.900
 extension or works 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.900
 what is coming 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:45.219
 finish the finishes is just put the 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:45.219
 logic like that 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:51.289
 and that she alone from the creator just like that 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.040
 so that they will not be stained 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.210
 best 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:19.750
 same 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.220
 but you will not notice well what 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.680
 recommendations I can make when 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.889
 It is the first great cultural milestone 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:30.610
 let it dry so you can paint 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:32.300
 again and that gives good coverage well 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.460
 as here 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:38.210
 they realize is a good technique for 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:40.190
 restore the bags and I hope so 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.129
 as I had fun watching doing this 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.479
 video to have fun watching it and they will see 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:49.069
 that this is a good way to 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:51.970
 recreating the mind painting is a very very 

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:57.699
 good tactic to recreate the mind 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:57.699
 well I had a lot of fun since I used it 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:06.430
 it can be said that any effort 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:08.950
 that is what you leave the skin appointment 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:12.010
 you can pick it up with a brush and quite 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:14.170
 water and good to take all that for 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:16.930
 then paint it with paintings of the 

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:18.550
 Cloth painting clinics do not place it 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.370
 the sun to dry but in the 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.830
 shade and let it dry perfectly 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.300
 to then open the other passes with 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.970
 the good painting I hope you liked it 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.040
 this video if you liked the little hand up 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:32.290
 and subscribe and if you do not let me know 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.720
 in the bottom I send many 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:38.160
 gigantic kisses and good I hope them 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:41.400
 have liked this new idea 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:44.700
 so original and good you know they can 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:47.840
 make other designs is me 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:50.120
 look for the painting 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:53.330
 with a toothbrush what do I know 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:56.290
 well that's a matter of imagination them 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.290
 I send many kisses and hugs
