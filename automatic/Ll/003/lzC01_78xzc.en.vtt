you<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.100> be<00:00:44.309> in<00:00:44.460> their<00:00:44.610> base<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:45.180> under<00:00:45.600> like

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
you to be in their base in under like

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.869 
you to be in their base in under like
five<00:00:46.110> seconds<00:00:46.710> which<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:46.920> insane<00:00:47.460> but<00:00:47.760> it's

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
five seconds which is insane but it's

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.790 
five seconds which is insane but it's
really<00:00:48.000> simple<00:00:48.300> let's<00:00:48.870> get<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.140> how<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.440> do<00:00:49.680> it

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
really simple let's get in how to do it

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.560 
really simple let's get in how to do it
so<00:00:49.950> as<00:00:50.129> we<00:00:50.280> know<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.489> can<00:00:50.760> only<00:00:51.059> blink<00:00:51.329> twice

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
so as we know you can only blink twice

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.450 
so as we know you can only blink twice
and<00:00:52.020> then<00:00:52.230> there's<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.469> cool-down<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.370> how

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
and then there's a cool-down this is how

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.520 
and then there's a cool-down this is how
to<00:00:53.520> blink<00:00:53.760> three<00:00:54.090> times<00:00:54.360> with<00:00:54.660> no<00:00:54.840> cooldown<00:00:55.140> so

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
to blink three times with no cooldown so
