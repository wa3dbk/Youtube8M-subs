00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.949
 what did you do like a bit around 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.619
 The device is around and we are here 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:29.840

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.419

 Earphone connection are the back 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.230
 I was not quite impressed so now 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.830
 but here we have the blue button 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.900
 so that you can find this immediately it went 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.030
 then for the flashlight 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.010
 So just press and you have directly 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.270
 the flashlight you have to over here 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.910

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.980
 according to us media here on the left 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.300
 all shaken so good to meet 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.470
 Of course I 'm scratching it and 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.020
 protected 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.450
 around here are three physical buttons around 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.960
 button back and once here, of course 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.420
 still the current eps and that 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.330
 smartphone is 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:17.580
 So shock protected I think of 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:20.880
 Tones of 1.2 meters 67 certified 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.979
 So dust and have protected water 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.550
 We open the flap here 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.590
 possibility once micro sd card and 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:33.399
 to use the micro-sim 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.840
 besides, we have the battery here 2000 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.759
 see twice milliamps here 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.280
 we also have the nfc here but in 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:44.090
 Smartphone is available as well 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:46.549
 a 4g smartphone so lt 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.549
 and the design actually cool 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:52.170
 and stylish so really here 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.810
 industrial design 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.490
 looks very cool a bit 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.970
 the technical data we have a 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.330
 here synonymous first a 5 inch display 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.049
 his 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:07.770
 gls tft and we have a resolution of 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:10.379
 Of course bvg is not necessarily 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.629
 are only 800 x 480 pixels 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.450
 well below 27 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:18.390
 but I have to say that still looks 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.129
 okay, of course, and with such a 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.530
 You do not need a smartphone now 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.349
 necessarily the 27 p resolution there it comes 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.269
 of course here more on battery runtime 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:29.190
 and that you can look good here too 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.880
 also in the display and yes if I am here 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.070
 close go off 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.870
 in a sense, you can still see the pixels 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.210
 not possible so that 's on everyone 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.270
 case okay 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:43.060
 and the performance with the quad core 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:47.590
 processor with 1.2 gigahertz to 105 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.270
 gigabyte ram and then eight gigabytes 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.700
 create memory for the user 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.570
 you then again by means of 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.760
 expand micro sd card 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.890
 Of course we have two 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.590
 cameras a 2 megapixel camera in front 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.150
 and on the back is a 5 can 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.610
 as you have already seen with 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.740
 LED light here also also the 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:10.840
 Speaker smartphone away 154 grams 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:14.290
 and by that it is not 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.520
 I am really super heavy as a wlan 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.860

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.930
 gps jonas just everything we have from one 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.760
 Of course, expect smartphone 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.650
 and the beautiful is just that is one 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.689
 bit hradil so it's for everyone 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.189

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.920
 those is such a smartphone what 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:41.300
 also a bit more enduring, of course 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.470

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.480

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.819

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.040
 are out there sometimes times in the rain 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.810
 and then of course not 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.170
 every smartphone can use 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:58.050
