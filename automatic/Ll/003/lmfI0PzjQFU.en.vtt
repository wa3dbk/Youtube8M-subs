00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.179
 ns godzilla creepypasta part 1 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.610
 more than anything I love two things 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.389
 everything related to shit and movies comics 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.220
 and games and games inflicted so when came out 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.500
 godzilla monster sham stax 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.720
 it was like a playful dream 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.330
 most of the levels should destroy 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.500
 tanks and planes at the end of fighting 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.289
 different gods godiva 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.429
 Someone like this game will seem 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.619
 mediocre but I didn't care 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.219
 this and when i got it to my 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.420
 decade 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.579
 I played it all night long but to 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.370
 Sorry I had to sell everything later 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.920
 my games years later I found an emulator 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.960
 for nes and after a great old hunt 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.760
 playing games my friend helped me find a copy 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.520
 please monster monster 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.079
 I quickly uploaded my favorite childhood game 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.690
 I never even thought to ask 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.670
 him where he found this game is also me 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.230
 got from him other games legend of 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.239
 zelde bomberman 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.219
 a few sucky things that 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.690
 included in the game collection called 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.619
 action 52 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.270
 but godzilla always came first 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.070
 the table and me start the game like me already 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.040
 a huge nostalgia flooded 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.580
 having heard the music in the form of the game menu I already 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.740
 started smiling like an idiot some people 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.750
 laugh at me because of the game 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.729
 such outdated games i never 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.869
 got so much pleasure so much 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.299
 how much of the yoke inflicted but after that 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.159
 happened to the game I no longer have 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.950
 some nostalgic feelings for them 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.409
 Having passed the first few levels I reached 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.570
 before the first boss battle 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.280
 began 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.350
 my first opponent was bizarro 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.110
 giant squid who never 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.119
 Movies with the gorilla appeared 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.490
 annoying thing about fighting it 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.020
 that gizu once immediately pushes you away 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.299
 corner and starts hitting you with your own 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.159
 tentacles and you can not move yet 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.680
 he will not finish you as much as he 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.630
 it must be installed at that moment 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.060
 when the timer doesn't work you should 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.340
 attack him first plus you can 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.450
 restore a little health only here 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.369
 there was a glitch in the game 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.830
 as soon as he began to beat me he did 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.730
 did not stop the fight need to complete for 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.319
 40 seconds 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.060
 but all these things were happening 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.069
 not 5 minutes after a while 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.019
 there were problems saying comiccone 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:25.109
 small red began to appear 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:27.510
 blocks on to the tigers the very end I noticed 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:29.489
 A new monster of which was not at all in 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.859
 the game is just aroused my interest 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.480
 I decided to go through the following levels as 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:36.389
 quicker to see the monster in 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.579
 action first during the battle with 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:41.040
 cheap everything went fine but as soon 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:43.590
 I defeated him just sprite occurred 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.870
 strangeness u seemed to have started myself 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.849
 set fire and appeared on the screen again 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:53.549
 red blocks and at the same time and the eyes now 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.469
 I know that the glitches from the hero were a hint at 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.299
 what is wrong with the game but I 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:59.400
 ignored this situation and started 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.260
 play next in the next battle with 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.579
 the boss was waiting for me next surprises 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.769
 be presented to the struggle with the flour 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.430
 Magera was twice my size 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.739
 you surprised me 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.750
 he was also hard to beat but soon 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:16.310
 I coped with him and cost him 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.349
 die as another glitch arose 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.349
 he seemed to be falling apart 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:25.319
 and also hide in the right corner of the screen 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:28.259
 you will notice an incomprehensible text and something 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:31.739
 similar to a bird in a cage that all this 

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:33.329
 meant and never knew at that moment 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.609
 when i was ready to fight with 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.979
 tyrannosaurus then the adversary himself 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:39.509
 I have not been in the game before 

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:41.639
 started to worry about what glitches 

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:43.979
 waiting for me but to my surprise 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:47.069
 tyrannosaurus in this game looked beautiful 

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:49.669
 even too there were no problems 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.900
 during the game 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:54.509
 this fight seemed very interesting to me 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.859
 and here I went through the first levels and already 

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:59.759
 was going to move to another location 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:03.650
 the planet jupiter but instead it is on the screen 

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:03.650
 pathos appeared
