00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.919
 hi girls whose every day everything for a little haircut hairstyle 

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:11.609
 because it is true that it is true that it is asked a lot of times to make 

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:13.969
 hairstyles except that vankor big place 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.109
 I do not have a particular technique in France 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.519
 that is to say that I will take my hair tied and that goes right 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:21.779
 left pretty much like that 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.630
 and a few months it will make a mythical game against metz so he wants 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.899
 here I am not at night these passages particular way 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.160
 why today in montreal how to do something a little different 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.430
 so that's what I call the sixtine bun 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.430
 the author of the work item there so that gives that 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.880
 at lacoste 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.640
 you are going to need weapons 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.230
 Bennenbroek 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.220
 I can not believe that 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.560
 this shop because there just like cÃ©cile the color of 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.480
 the exciting rocks is still better 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.590
 and maybe even a little advance 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.590
 like this source 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.590
 many options 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.500
 China has ended and the scrub 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.600
 to do what we have to do is nice to have a little hair 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.330
 for that the road is still long 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.780
 but i'm going to start by becoming cinema even though so so i'm going to be 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.780
 quite open and aside 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.330
 to this growth 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.500
 and at almost any age it's 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.100
 to 1 5 or 6 7 centimeters 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.689
 I come with whom she studied in France in this area m 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.100
 Eric gerets descent like this site straight towards the afp 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.180
 behind the ear 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.410
 and to celebrate the Jewish Passover 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.410
 all this mass of hair 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.530
 so I worked well while the breach 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.760
 she issued an arrest warrant the Tehran chain 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.390
 we can do it as well 4 October 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.390
 I would rather see hair slamming 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.789
 like the seventh 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.279
 why we are here 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:16.279
 we validate if we really have a 

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:18.979
 he traced us 

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:21.979
 turn the corruption so we will become parents 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:25.659
 he creates another colleague as soon as I take my hair 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.819
 towards the back of the ears 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.159
 and I kept with only one part that associates 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:33.439
 that I had encrypted and then 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:35.119
 the tension is growing 

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:38.119
 for who 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:42.069
 for the mayor 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.589
 we just take all the big sections pretty much like this 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:49.879
 and for which to treat them alex hundreds of bears that is to say go 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.259
 in the sense a staff 

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:54.889
 the hair 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:58.189
 eyi then to crack it really really takes a lot of night they stand 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:02:59.209
 especially that rare 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.319
 I have hair rather times 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.209
 dompierre when I fear a little a whole if I want this scene must I 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.419
 do it 

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:10.269
 do not miss it halfway 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.619
 on the contrary, like defecting machines 

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:15.729
 six other men 

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:18.729
 snow in front of specific fact 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.029
 however frankly tell you very practical then we take strands of 

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:27.699
 behind concrete too 

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:28.879
 kroos 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:31.879
 give volume 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:37.989
 after 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.349
 in any case back 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.649
 there we are going to party 

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:45.649
 clemessy york where she 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:49.819
 the axis investigation and I can not accept it actually why I would 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.819
 to be like that 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.339
 explain this he is ap 

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:56.549
 annuities 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.069
 and only one regret that are created 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.109
 alone to patrick morelle 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:04.109
 for nothing for the little ones because the act 

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:08.209
 and although I have such a choice 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.269
 michel dallaire 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.269
 encrypted on the accepted buying taste 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.849
 so there like that 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.129
 and then we'll go back a little to a job and another doctoral collapse 

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:29.499
 worry out of the water 

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:30.879
 she does it well 

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:33.809
 the rise a little bit so as to make sure that the 

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:34.700
 she is 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.990
 earlier or I like 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.990
 so that's not to color too low this stuff 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.550
 and then I come very lightly 

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:49.080
 for me 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.289
 to clear the draws 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:55.120
 or more 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.229
 we take off our little because 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.900
 so there the whole secret behind 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:05.589
 so silver light all take 

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:12.639
 and I'm going to all this falls on one side also taking down 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.990
 article 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.210
 we can generate it up a bit 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.469
 m 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:23.469
 there is the web a video for children 

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:31.469
 we will see 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.530
 not a little scared several weeks 

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:39.970
 tactics 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.479
 duck 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:44.500
 well i will buy back their expenses where k 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:48.879
 me I'm not a pro of the coast on it was not at that can be 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:51.499
 a little before 

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:53.650
 I try to hide them as I can 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.650
 the war on terror 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.749
 There was something for everyone 

00:05:57.749 --> 00:06:00.499
 for the course of a power of nike 

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:04.789
 we do not go to the right of his teammate Jeremy on the mother a 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:05.969
 real slap 

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:08.650
 so that's what I do next and livia 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.849
 indeed these blacks 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:12.369
 a prelate is simple 

00:06:12.369 --> 00:06:15.300
 I'm a master of my hair 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.969
 like this session 

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:19.159
 a little team 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:22.159
 behind Somalia 

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:27.629
 the small images that breaks 

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:28.960
 I come 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.159
 the stuck behind 

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:34.389
 q and the young civilian guard two small wicks 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:37.309
 but percent 

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:40.409
 the parts that I have 

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:44.339
 to think in term that's it gives something like that our kind of knot 

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:47.490
 signing a little apathetic sitting in the foot with m 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.610
 the wick so many signs indeed stretch the ears with a 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.779
 big odds 4 on this date 

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:57.699
 he is the very type of fingers the troops of tripoli attests country 

00:06:58.469 --> 00:07:01.469
 it is for him the vein that this is what it incites behind 

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:09.319
 belgium hopes that this tool in quartet will have you better heiress in 

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:10.179
 a next life lasts
