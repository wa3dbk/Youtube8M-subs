00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
sometimes you may experience that you

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.770 
sometimes you may experience that you
make<00:00:10.230> it<00:00:10.380> change<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:10.920> setting<00:00:11.660> but<00:00:12.660> then

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
make it change to a setting but then

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.049 
make it change to a setting but then
discover<00:00:13.200> that<00:00:13.340> after<00:00:14.340> you've<00:00:14.490> written<00:00:14.730> this

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
discover that after you've written this

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.730 
discover that after you've written this
change<00:00:15.389> into<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.750> memory<00:00:16.109> that<00:00:16.379> it's<00:00:16.560> not

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
change into the memory that it's not

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.540 
change into the memory that it's not
actually<00:00:17.460> saved<00:00:17.990> well<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:19.980> really<00:00:20.430> not

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
actually saved well this is really not

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.130 
actually saved well this is really not
the<00:00:20.609> case<00:00:20.939> but<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.420> reason<00:00:21.810> it's<00:00:21.960> happening

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
the case but the reason it's happening

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.550 
the case but the reason it's happening
is<00:00:22.680> because<00:00:22.920> usually<00:00:23.900> one<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:24.930> these<00:00:25.109> control

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
is because usually one of these control

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.529 
is because usually one of these control
pedals<00:00:25.949> or<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.609> expression<00:00:27.029> pedal<00:00:27.060> toast

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
pedals or the expression pedal toast

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.429 
pedals or the expression pedal toast
which<00:00:27.810> has<00:00:28.680> been<00:00:28.890> assigned<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:30.230> turn<00:00:31.230> that

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
which has been assigned to turn that

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.670 
which has been assigned to turn that
same<00:00:31.769> feature<00:00:32.070> on<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.610> off<00:00:32.700> or<00:00:33.000> adjust<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.690> and

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
off but when I play my guitar I'm still

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.490 
off but when I play my guitar I'm still
here<00:01:17.009> in<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.340> PCM<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.090> then<00:01:18.960> when<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.170> go<00:01:19.350> into

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
here in the PCM and then when I go into

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.039 
here in the PCM and then when I go into
edit<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.979> patch<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.490> luck<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:21.000> discover<00:01:21.869> this

PCM<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.650> still<00:01:22.860> on<00:01:23.330> now<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.390> reason<00:01:24.750> that

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
PCM is still on now the reason that

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.749 
PCM is still on now the reason that
happened<00:01:25.229> in<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.439> patch<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:26.040> because<00:01:26.580> this

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
happened in this patch is because this

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.330 
I'm gonna highlight the pedal gk control
because<00:01:57.299> it's<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.860> one<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.040> pedals

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
because it's the one of the pedals

that's doing this press ENTER to go into
that<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.969> now<00:02:03.420> I'm<00:02:03.540> on<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.659> control<00:02:04.020> ctrl<00:02:04.770> tab

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
that and now I'm on the control ctrl tab

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.819 
that and now I'm on the control ctrl tab
here<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.520> control<00:02:05.790> page<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.469> my<00:02:07.469> control

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
here the control page and my control

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.609 
here the control page and my control
function<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.610> toe<00:02:08.819> switch<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.479> as<00:02:10.440> you

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
function is the toe switch and as you

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.120 
function is the toe switch and as you
can<00:02:10.770> see<00:02:10.950> when<00:02:11.129> my<00:02:11.250> switch<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.670> off

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
can see when my switch is off

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.430 
can see when my switch is off
it<00:02:13.190> turns<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.910> PCM<00:02:14.330> tone<00:02:14.510> off<00:02:14.780> but<00:02:15.200> when<00:02:15.320> my

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
it turns the PCM tone off but when my

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.150 
it turns the PCM tone off but when my
switch<00:02:15.710> is<00:02:15.890> on<00:02:16.570> here<00:02:17.570> are<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:18.050> four<00:02:18.500> tones<00:02:18.770> for

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
switch is on here are the four tones for

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.200 
switch is on here are the four tones for
on<00:02:19.750> this<00:02:20.750> PCM<00:02:21.260> tone<00:02:21.470> is<00:02:21.650> on<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:22.070> that's<00:02:22.940> what

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
on this PCM tone is on and that's what

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.060 
on this PCM tone is on and that's what
we<00:02:23.360> saw<00:02:23.630> when<00:02:23.870> I<00:02:23.900> was<00:02:24.050> pressing<00:02:24.440> that<00:02:24.560> pedal<00:02:24.890> I

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
we saw when I was pressing that pedal I

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.030 
we saw when I was pressing that pedal I
don't<00:02:26.030> want<00:02:26.180> this<00:02:26.270> to<00:02:26.420> happen<00:02:26.600> so<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:27.620> easiest

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
don't want this to happen so the easiest

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.890 
don't want this to happen so the easiest
thing<00:02:28.310> to<00:02:28.340> do<00:02:28.640> is<00:02:28.880> to<00:02:29.060> simply<00:02:29.270> turn<00:02:29.690> the

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
thing to do is to simply turn the

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.090 
thing to do is to simply turn the
control<00:02:30.320> function<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.760> off<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:32.920> now<00:02:33.920> this

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
control function to off and now this

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.830 
control function to off and now this
control<00:02:34.490> function<00:02:34.970> and<00:02:35.150> status<00:02:35.510> all<00:02:35.660> that

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
control function and status all that

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.450 
control function and status all that
went<00:02:36.140> away<00:02:36.170> because<00:02:36.530> there's<00:02:36.950> nothing<00:02:37.190> to

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
went away because there's nothing to

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.050 
went away because there's nothing to
control<00:02:37.930> now<00:02:38.930> I'm<00:02:39.110> going<00:02:39.380> to<00:02:39.560> exit<00:02:40.460> and<00:02:40.670> then

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
control now I'm going to exit and then

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.990 
control now I'm going to exit and then
page<00:02:41.390> to<00:02:41.690> my<00:02:41.810> tone<00:02:42.080> screen<00:02:42.470> and<00:02:42.680> then<00:02:43.640> make<00:02:43.850> the

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
page to my tone screen and then make the

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.190 
page to my tone screen and then make the
setting<00:02:44.330> that<00:02:44.360> I<00:02:44.450> want<00:02:44.690> it<00:02:44.750> again

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
setting that I want it again

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.850 
setting that I want it again

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
that another thing that it could be

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.320 
that another thing that it could be
other<00:03:12.110> than<00:03:12.230> control<00:03:12.950> I'm<00:03:13.310> gonna<00:03:13.760> go<00:03:13.940> back<00:03:14.120> to

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
other than control I'm gonna go back to

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.720 
other than control I'm gonna go back to
this<00:03:14.480> master<00:03:15.020> page<00:03:15.470> and<00:03:15.800> then<00:03:15.980> pedal<00:03:16.340> GK

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
this master page and then pedal GK

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.690 
this master page and then pedal GK
control<00:03:17.500> is<00:03:18.500> it<00:03:18.710> could<00:03:18.830> also<00:03:19.040> be<00:03:19.220> this

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
control is it could also be this

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.690 
control is it could also be this
expression<00:03:20.480> switch<00:03:21.170> now<00:03:21.950> this<00:03:22.160> is<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:22.490> toe

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
expression switch now this is the toe

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.600 
expression switch now this is the toe
switch<00:03:23.000> of<00:03:23.270> the<00:03:23.390> expression<00:03:23.870> pedal<00:03:24.310> so<00:03:25.310> also

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
switch of the expression pedal so also

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.230 
switch of the expression pedal so also
if<00:03:26.390> if<00:03:26.750> control<00:03:27.290> isn't<00:03:27.800> doing<00:03:28.280> it<00:03:28.430> then<00:03:29.210> you

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
if if control isn't doing it then you

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.540 
if if control isn't doing it then you
should<00:03:29.480> also<00:03:29.690> page<00:03:30.290> over<00:03:30.710> to<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:31.040> expression

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
should also page over to the expression

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.120 
should also page over to the expression
switch<00:03:31.850> page<00:03:32.120> and<00:03:32.420> make<00:03:32.900> sure<00:03:32.930> that<00:03:33.380> is<00:03:33.650> not

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
switch page and make sure that is not

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.980 
switch page and make sure that is not
changing<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:35.150> tone<00:03:35.330> switch<00:03:35.540> or<00:03:35.840> the

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
changing the tone switch or the

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:37.890 
changing the tone switch or the
parameter<00:03:36.440> that<00:03:36.590> you<00:03:36.860> are<00:03:37.070> trying<00:03:37.370> to<00:03:37.490> adjust

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
parameter that you are trying to adjust

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.310 
parameter that you are trying to adjust
so<00:03:38.900> that's<00:03:39.680> how<00:03:40.010> you<00:03:40.070> fix<00:03:40.610> that<00:03:40.880> issue<00:03:41.090> I<00:03:41.450> hope
