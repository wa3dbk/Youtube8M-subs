00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.490 
but yeah so the center you can see we
have<00:01:48.329> clan<00:01:48.570> castle<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.020> middle<00:01:49.140> as<00:01:49.350> well

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
have clan castle in the middle as well

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.130 
have clan castle in the middle as well
as<00:01:49.590> dark<00:01:49.799> elixir<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.399> our<00:01:50.909> expose<00:01:51.450> as<00:01:51.750> well<00:01:51.960> as

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
as dark elixir and our expose as well as

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.609 
as dark elixir and our expose as well as
gold<00:01:52.530> because<00:01:53.689> I'm<00:01:54.689> trying<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:54.990> upgrade<00:01:55.200> and

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
gold because I'm trying to upgrade and

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.380 
gold because I'm trying to upgrade and
I'm<00:01:55.950> trying<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.219> upgrade<00:01:56.490> all<00:01:56.640> my<00:01:56.790> walls<00:01:57.030> and

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
I'm trying to upgrade all my walls and

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.880 
I'm trying to upgrade all my walls and
it's<00:01:57.540> going<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.810> take<00:01:57.990> forever<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.530> think<00:01:58.649> we

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
it's going to take forever I think we

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.690 
it's going to take forever I think we
have<00:01:59.009> 25<00:01:59.610> of<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.540> level<00:02:01.409> behind<00:02:01.680> walls<00:02:02.009> which

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
have 25 of the level behind walls which

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.310 
have 25 of the level behind walls which
isn't<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.119> many<00:02:03.450> we<00:02:03.689> still<00:02:03.930> have<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.110> whole

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
isn't that many we still have a whole

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.620 
isn't that many we still have a whole
lot<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.649> go<00:02:04.920> but<00:02:05.299> we'll<00:02:06.299> get<00:02:06.450> there<00:02:06.600> eventually

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
lot to go but we'll get there eventually

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.020 
lot to go but we'll get there eventually
this<00:02:07.170> glitch<00:02:07.500> right<00:02:07.710> here<00:02:07.950> always<00:02:08.160> happens<00:02:08.789> in

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
this glitch right here always happens in

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.639 
this glitch right here always happens in
like<00:02:09.209> every<00:02:09.509> single<00:02:09.810> base<00:02:09.929> build<00:02:10.200> video<00:02:10.440> that

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
like every single base build video that

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.340 
like every single base build video that
I<00:02:10.709> do<00:02:10.910> next<00:02:11.910> we're<00:02:12.120> gonna<00:02:12.180> bring<00:02:12.420> in<00:02:12.540> our<00:02:12.660> more

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
I do next we're gonna bring in our more

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.440 
I do next we're gonna bring in our more
Splash<00:02:13.860> Damage<00:02:13.890> as<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:14.610> always<00:02:14.760> talk<00:02:15.030> about<00:02:15.060> is

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
Splash Damage as I always talk about is

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.450 
Splash Damage as I always talk about is
super-important<00:02:16.380> and<00:02:17.280> I'm<00:02:17.340> gonna

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
super-important and I'm gonna

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.240 
super-important and I'm gonna
triangulate<00:02:17.760> those<00:02:18.300> around<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.080> base<00:02:19.290> just

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
triangulate those around the base just

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.360 
triangulate those around the base just
like<00:02:20.400> this<00:02:21.150> there's<00:02:21.480> another<00:02:21.540> wall<00:02:22.020> glitch<00:02:22.370> so

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
like this there's another wall glitch so

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.920 
like this there's another wall glitch so
you<00:02:23.430> can<00:02:23.670> see<00:02:23.820> those<00:02:24.000> are<00:02:24.150> triangulated<00:02:24.720> and

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
you can see those are triangulated and

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.310 
you can see those are triangulated and
they<00:02:25.020> cover<00:02:25.320> pretty<00:02:25.710> much<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:26.160> entire<00:02:26.580> base

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
they cover pretty much the entire base

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.350 
they cover pretty much the entire base
so<00:02:28.320> those<00:02:28.800> are<00:02:28.920> in<00:02:29.070> really<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.850> perfect<00:02:30.090> place

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
so those are in really the perfect place

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.930 
so those are in really the perfect place
that<00:02:30.540> they<00:02:30.630> can<00:02:30.810> be<00:02:30.960> for<00:02:31.170> this<00:02:31.260> base<00:02:31.470> design

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
that they can be for this base design

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.460 
that they can be for this base design
next<00:02:32.940> we're<00:02:33.090> gonna<00:02:33.150> bring<00:02:33.450> in<00:02:33.660> our<00:02:33.900> wizard

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
next we're gonna bring in our wizard

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.850 
next we're gonna bring in our wizard
tower<00:02:34.710> which<00:02:35.180> obviously<00:02:36.180> helps<00:02:37.170> out<00:02:37.440> as<00:02:37.620> well

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
tower which obviously helps out as well

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.500 
tower which obviously helps out as well
with<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.400> Splash<00:02:38.700> Damage<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:39.300> we're<00:02:39.390> gonna

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
with the Splash Damage and we're gonna

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.410 
with the Splash Damage and we're gonna
put<00:02:39.750> those<00:02:39.870> around<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.380> base<00:02:40.820> I'm<00:02:41.820> also<00:02:42.180> I'm

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
put those around the base I'm also I'm

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.090 
put those around the base I'm also I'm
gonna<00:02:42.510> bring<00:02:42.720> in<00:02:42.870> these<00:02:43.020> 2<00:02:43.260> elixir<00:02:43.530> storages

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100

already trying elated working their way

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.500 
already trying elated working their way
around<00:02:55.200> protecting<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.520> resources<00:02:57.120> in<00:02:57.390> the

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
around protecting the resources in the

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.660 
around protecting the resources in the
middle<00:02:57.870> of<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.350> base<00:02:58.530> like<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.280> dark<00:02:59.460> elixir

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670

and an archer tower I send that
backwards<00:03:10.320> I<00:03:10.860> didn't<00:03:11.460> remove<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.790> Tesla's

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
backwards I didn't remove the Tesla's

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.310 
backwards I didn't remove the Tesla's
earlier<00:03:12.510> so<00:03:12.720> as<00:03:12.780> you<00:03:12.870> can<00:03:12.930> see<00:03:12.990> we<00:03:13.200> have<00:03:13.290> our

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
earlier so as you can see we have our

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.160 
earlier so as you can see we have our
Tesla's<00:03:13.860> around<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.220> base<00:03:14.400> as<00:03:14.610> well<00:03:15.170> these

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
Tesla's around the base as well these

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.890 
Tesla's around the base as well these
are<00:03:16.230> in<00:03:16.740> here<00:03:17.040> with<00:03:17.190> two<00:03:17.220> traps<00:03:17.760> so<00:03:18.090> any<00:03:18.390> Giants

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
are in here with two traps so any Giants

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.930 
are in here with two traps so any Giants
or<00:03:18.990> anything<00:03:19.140> that<00:03:19.260> comes<00:03:19.560> in<00:03:19.710> there<00:03:19.940> are

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
or anything that comes in there are

or anything that comes in there are
definitely<00:03:21.420> going<00:03:21.600> to<00:03:21.750> regret<00:03:22.680> breaking<00:03:22.860> in

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
definitely going to regret breaking in

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.100 
definitely going to regret breaking in
there<00:03:23.370> I<00:03:23.520> had<00:03:23.850> this<00:03:24.030> double<00:03:24.450> section<00:03:24.810> of<00:03:24.900> walls

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
there I had this double section of walls

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.440 
there I had this double section of walls
right<00:03:25.410> here<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:25.890> protect<00:03:26.370> this<00:03:26.730> core<00:03:27.090> that<00:03:27.300> has

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
right here to protect this core that has

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.120 
right here to protect this core that has
our<00:03:27.570> mortars<00:03:28.020> in<00:03:28.170> it<00:03:28.320> and<00:03:28.470> then<00:03:28.950> we're<00:03:29.070> gonna

our mortars in it and then we're gonna

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.950 
our mortars in it and then we're gonna
help<00:03:29.400> protect<00:03:29.730> those<00:03:29.850> mortars<00:03:30.270> as<00:03:30.420> well<00:03:30.630> with

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
protect just so that once the troops do

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.520 
protect just so that once the troops do
get<00:05:02.970> in<00:05:03.150> and<00:05:03.390> they<00:05:03.450> can't<00:05:03.810> use<00:05:03.960> wall<00:05:04.200> breakers

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:05.810 
get in and they can't use wall breakers
anymore<00:05:04.860> because<00:05:04.980> they're<00:05:05.160> too<00:05:05.340> far<00:05:05.580> in<00:05:05.790> and

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
anymore because they're too far in and

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.010 
anymore because they're too far in and
they're<00:05:06.120> just<00:05:06.240> gonna<00:05:06.330> be<00:05:06.540> beating<00:05:06.810> on<00:05:06.900> the

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
they're just gonna be beating on the

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.360 
they're just gonna be beating on the

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
wall for a really long time

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.540 
wall for a really long time
while<00:05:08.760> my<00:05:08.880> defenses<00:05:09.450> shoot<00:05:09.720> at<00:05:09.840> them<00:05:09.990> oh<00:05:10.740> cool

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
while my defenses shoot at them oh cool

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.520 
while my defenses shoot at them oh cool
I<00:05:11.820> guess<00:05:12.360> that's<00:05:12.570> new<00:05:12.720> to<00:05:12.870> the<00:05:12.960> update<00:05:13.290> that<00:05:13.500> I

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
I guess that's new to the update that I

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.490 
I guess that's new to the update that I
could<00:05:13.740> load<00:05:14.120> both<00:05:15.120> of<00:05:15.330> the<00:05:15.390> Expos<00:05:15.840> at<00:05:16.020> once<00:05:16.230> I

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
could load both of the Expos at once I

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.170 
could load both of the Expos at once I
didn't<00:05:17.280> see<00:05:17.400> that<00:05:17.430> in<00:05:17.610> the<00:05:17.670> note<00:05:17.820> so<00:05:18.030> that's

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
didn't see that in the note so that's

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.300 
didn't see that in the note so that's
kind<00:05:18.360> of<00:05:18.390> cool

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
kind of cool

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.130 
kind of cool

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
but I am excited about this bases on a

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.330 
but I am excited about this bases on a
thing<00:05:22.350> that<00:05:22.470> it's<00:05:22.620> gonna<00:05:22.710> work<00:05:22.980> pretty<00:05:23.190> well

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
thing that it's gonna work pretty well

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.770 
thing that it's gonna work pretty well
especially<00:05:23.790> with<00:05:24.030> protecting<00:05:24.450> my<00:05:24.570> dark

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
wonder what her attack speed is it

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.710 
wonder what her attack speed is it
doesn't<00:05:48.900> say<00:05:49.230> in<00:05:49.530> the<00:05:49.650> notes<00:05:50.540> movement<00:05:51.540> speed

guys<00:05:55.530> know<00:05:55.740> how<00:05:55.890> this<00:05:56.040> base<00:05:56.250> works<00:05:56.520> out<00:05:56.700> for<00:05:56.820> me

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
guys know how this base works out for me

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.370 
guys know how this base works out for me
maybe<00:05:57.120> show<00:05:57.330> y'all<00:05:57.480> some<00:05:57.660> replays<00:05:58.020> since<00:05:58.260> it

maybe show y'all some replays since it
is<00:05:58.470> a<00:05:58.500> farming<00:05:59.010> base<00:05:59.160> a<00:05:59.220> lot<00:05:59.520> of<00:05:59.700> the<00:05:59.850> attacks

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
is a farming base a lot of the attacks

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.960 
is a farming base a lot of the attacks
are<00:06:01.050> going<00:06:01.320> to<00:06:01.470> be<00:06:01.650> or<00:06:01.980> defenses<00:06:02.550> are<00:06:02.670> gonna<00:06:02.760> be

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:24.900 
out so my pumps around the edges are

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.200 
out so my pumps around the edges are
what's<00:06:25.440> going<00:06:25.740> to<00:06:25.770> give<00:06:26.340> them<00:06:26.580> a<00:06:26.610> good<00:06:26.940> amount

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 
to try it out go ahead I don't really

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.620 
to try it out go ahead I don't really
know<00:06:34.650> what<00:06:34.950> I'm<00:06:35.100> gonna<00:06:35.250> call<00:06:35.670> it

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
know what I'm gonna call it

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.250 
know what I'm gonna call it
why<00:06:36.810> don't<00:06:36.990> we<00:06:37.080> call<00:06:37.380> it<00:06:37.620> the<00:06:37.980> I<00:06:39.170> don't<00:06:40.170> know

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.260 
why don't we call it the I don't know

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.380 
why don't we call it the I don't know
diamond<00:06:40.770> have<00:06:40.890> I<00:06:40.980> made<00:06:41.100> a<00:06:41.160> diamond<00:06:41.520> base<00:06:41.670> let's

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:42.390 
diamond have I made a diamond base let's

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:43.940 
diamond have I made a diamond base let's
call<00:06:42.570> it<00:06:42.660> the<00:06:42.750> diamond<00:06:43.140> I<00:06:43.290> don't<00:06:43.440> have<00:06:43.560> a<00:06:43.590> medal

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:43.950 
call it the diamond I don't have a medal

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.920 
call it the diamond I don't have a medal
or<00:06:43.980> not<00:06:44.220> but<00:06:44.460> I<00:06:44.490> think<00:06:44.640> this<00:06:45.000> works<00:06:45.270> when<00:06:45.840> it

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:45.930 
or not but I think this works when it

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.120 
or not but I think this works when it
comes<00:06:46.110> to<00:06:46.260> diamond<00:06:46.560> because<00:06:46.710> of<00:06:46.920> all<00:06:47.010> the

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.130 
comes to diamond because of all the

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.690 
comes to diamond because of all the
different<00:06:47.400> elements<00:06:47.610> in<00:06:47.880> it<00:06:48.800> so<00:06:49.800> yeah<00:06:50.400> that's

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:50.700 
different elements in it so yeah that's

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.010 
different elements in it so yeah that's
gonna<00:06:50.820> be<00:06:50.910> it<00:06:51.060> though<00:06:51.150> thank<00:06:51.420> you<00:06:51.480> so<00:06:51.720> much<00:06:51.870> for
