00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
okay here we have the second test of my

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.949 
okay here we have the second test of my
first<00:00:02.580> cell<00:00:02.790> but<00:00:02.939> it's<00:00:03.060> really<00:00:03.210> just<00:00:03.389> a<00:00:03.540> junker

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
first cell but it's really just a junker

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.769 
first cell but it's really just a junker
to<00:00:04.560> test<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:04.920> housing<00:00:05.310> for<00:00:05.640> the<00:00:06.420> next<00:00:06.629> cell

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
to test the housing for the next cell

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.839 
to test the housing for the next cell
i'll<00:00:06.870> be<00:00:07.049> making<00:00:07.170> around<00:00:07.410> friday<00:00:07.849> it's

and<00:00:24.150> I'll<00:00:24.210> have<00:00:24.359> five<00:00:24.750> charged<00:00:25.080> plates<00:00:25.410> in<00:00:25.590> a

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
and I'll have five charged plates in a

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.950 
and I'll have five charged plates in a
neutral<00:00:25.830> plate<00:00:26.220> or<00:00:26.490> two<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:26.760> between<00:00:27.060> each<00:00:27.090> I'm

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
neutral plate or two in between each I'm

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.310 
neutral plate or two in between each I'm
just<00:00:28.260> using<00:00:28.439> regular<00:00:28.619> tap<00:00:29.070> water<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:30.320> tossed

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
just using regular tap water and tossed

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.030 
just using regular tap water and tossed
a<00:00:31.529> better<00:00:32.520> spoonful<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.059> baking<00:00:33.149> soda<00:00:33.390> in<00:00:34.040> cell

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
a better spoonful of baking soda in cell

a better spoonful of baking soda in cell
housing<00:00:35.430> similar<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.120> zero<00:00:36.840> fossil<00:00:37.200> fuels

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
housing similar to zero fossil fuels

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.319 
housing similar to zero fossil fuels
with<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.829> blow<00:00:38.010> out<00:00:38.190> on<00:00:38.430> top<00:00:40.969> have<00:00:41.969> measured

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
with the blow out on top have measured

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.459 
with the blow out on top have measured
the<00:00:42.360> output<00:00:42.809> rate<00:00:42.989> but<00:00:44.510> yeah<00:00:45.510> not<00:00:46.230> going<00:00:46.410> to

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
the output rate but yeah not going to

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.850 
the output rate but yeah not going to
matter<00:00:46.590> because<00:00:46.920> it's<00:00:47.100> just<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.340> junker<00:00:47.760> and

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
matter because it's just a junker and

00:00:48.860 --> 00:01:02.460 
matter because it's just a junker and
put<00:00:49.860> together

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:11.620 

hose

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.280 

to<00:01:12.229> the<00:01:12.320> bubbler

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.590 

I<00:01:15.410> things<00:01:16.130> left<00:01:16.310> to<00:01:16.400> do<00:01:16.580> or<00:01:16.730> make<00:01:16.880> a<00:01:16.910> actual

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
I things left to do or make a actual

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.600 
I things left to do or make a actual
bubbler<00:01:17.960> with<00:01:18.110> the<00:01:18.200> brass<00:01:18.380> fitting<00:01:18.770> use<00:01:19.430> some

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
bubbler with the brass fitting use some

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.160 
bubbler with the brass fitting use some
silicone<00:01:20.030> sealant<00:01:20.450> around<00:01:20.480> the<00:01:20.720> connectors

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
silicone sealant around the connectors

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:38.590 
silicone sealant around the connectors
inside<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:21.650> lid<00:01:22.870> I'll<00:01:23.870> wire<00:01:24.050> it<00:01:24.080> up

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.770 

just<00:01:38.960> pushed<00:01:39.229> it<00:01:39.320> down

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.200 

where'd<00:01:45.409> you<00:01:45.440> go

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:02:08.419 

hope<00:01:51.870> I<00:01:52.020> got<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.200> leak<00:01:52.440> hold<00:01:52.740> up<00:01:54.710> here<00:01:55.710> we<00:01:55.770> go

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.999 

this<00:02:08.939> drawing

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
this drawing

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.940 
this drawing
about<00:02:11.640> 7<00:02:12.090> inch

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.949 

but<00:02:15.550> I'm<00:02:15.640> not<00:02:15.790> sure<00:02:15.819> that's<00:02:16.180> right<00:02:16.480> because<00:02:16.720> my

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
but I'm not sure that's right because my

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.780 
but I'm not sure that's right because my
multimeter<00:02:17.410> blew<00:02:17.739> out<00:02:17.890> when<00:02:18.129> I<00:02:18.160> tried<00:02:18.489> to<00:02:18.520> test

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
multimeter blew out when I tried to test

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.949 
multimeter blew out when I tried to test
because<00:02:19.150> it's<00:02:19.720> only<00:02:19.930> a<00:02:21.269> 5<00:02:22.269> amp<00:02:22.510> multimeter

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
because it's only a 5 amp multimeter

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:32.230 
because it's only a 5 amp multimeter
great<00:02:23.530> job<00:02:23.769> on<00:02:23.920> my<00:02:24.129> part

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:40.700 

is<00:02:33.240> hydrogen<00:02:33.900> just<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.620> show<00:02:34.830> you<00:02:39.620> sure<00:02:40.620> if

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
is hydrogen just to show you sure if

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:55.789 
is hydrogen just to show you sure if
it's<00:02:40.830> actually<00:02:41.070> warmed<00:02:41.520> up<00:02:41.640> yet

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.159 

and<00:02:56.799> that's<00:02:56.950> it
