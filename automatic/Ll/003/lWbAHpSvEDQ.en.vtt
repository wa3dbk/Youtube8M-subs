00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.820
 you expected 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.820
 i 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:38.030
 Lewis is about hate the soul 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:49.530
 because so hard the angels that 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.690
 help we do not have feet to use 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.270
 socks I think nobody should 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.640
 use sailboat first socks 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.200
 the socks can be useful for 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.990
 put our hot feet in the 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.500
 winter in fact I would like to be able 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:07.190
 use them this party so you can use 1500 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.190
 which give us well 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:21.329
 let me give you in the kitchen 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:30.179
 my sister is small help with that 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.179
 task in pc that I will say 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:48.590
 and on the 490 root wait a moment 46 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.590
 xx 87 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:00.090
 46 x 87 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.720
 how can it be about the square root 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.430
 of 90 that 's simply impossible 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.360
 frankly what the fuck is going on here 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.360
 but what 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.860
 two 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.280
 of the total and multiplied to the square of 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.920
 both sides we can do the root and 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:36.540
 well do what they normally do now 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.540
 let's see 74 by 9 is equal to 666 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.570
 do not worry, little one helps you with 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.140
 this task before you can say 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:50.980
 real was not 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.980
 nothing
