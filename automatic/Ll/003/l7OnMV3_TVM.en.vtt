prefer<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.640> have<00:02:59.790> this<00:03:00.060> it's<00:03:00.630> a<00:03:00.720> very

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
prefer to have this it's a very

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.660 
prefer to have this it's a very
different<00:03:01.380> tactile<00:03:01.770> feel<00:03:02.130> to<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.550> other

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
different tactile feel to the other

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.240 
different tactile feel to the other
knobs<00:03:02.970> so<00:03:03.450> it's<00:03:03.569> very<00:03:03.720> obvious<00:03:04.319> that<00:03:04.650> I'm

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
knobs so it's very obvious that I'm

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.710 
knobs so it's very obvious that I'm
either<00:03:05.520> touching<00:03:05.819> that<00:03:06.090> I'm<00:03:06.209> touching<00:03:06.420> one<00:03:06.660> of

the other dogs and it look it works

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.800 
the other dogs and it look it works
great<00:03:08.069> if<00:03:08.280> I<00:03:08.459> even<00:03:08.610> think<00:03:08.850> it's<00:03:08.940> quicker<00:03:09.270> I<00:03:09.480> do

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
great if I even think it's quicker I do

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.690 
great if I even think it's quicker I do
have<00:03:10.110> another<00:03:10.319> tripod<00:03:10.800> that<00:03:10.920> has<00:03:11.100> a<00:03:11.130> screw
