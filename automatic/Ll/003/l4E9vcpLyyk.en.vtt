00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.480 
was looking at four videos of this thing
even<00:00:27.960> when<00:00:28.050> i<00:00:28.109> was<00:00:28.320> considering<00:00:28.980> buying<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.460> i

sort<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.320> overview<00:00:35.280> so<00:00:35.640> i<00:00:35.670> thought<00:00:35.910> i<00:00:35.969> would

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
sort of overview so i thought i would

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.990 
sort of overview so i thought i would
make<00:00:36.329> one<00:00:36.570> but<00:00:36.780> then<00:00:36.899> again<00:00:36.989> i<00:00:37.110> always<00:00:37.440> do<00:00:38.000> let

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
make one but then again i always do let

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.430 
make one but then again i always do let
me<00:00:39.059> just<00:00:39.239> turn<00:00:39.420> on<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:39.719> light<00:00:40.020> here<00:00:40.200> it's<00:00:40.350> not

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
white light in this room but anyway I

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.040 
white light in this room but anyway I
just<00:00:45.000> thought<00:00:45.270> I'd<00:00:45.420> do<00:00:45.660> in<00:00:45.750> an<00:00:45.840> overview<00:00:46.550> so<00:00:47.550> I

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
just thought I'd do in an overview so I

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.430 
just thought I'd do in an overview so I
mean<00:00:49.050> as<00:00:49.399> here<00:00:50.399> at<00:00:50.489> me<00:00:50.640> say<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.480> unboxing

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
mean as here at me say in the unboxing

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.790 
mean as here at me say in the unboxing
this<00:00:53.160> thing<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.579> definitely<00:00:53.760> very<00:00:54.059> small<00:00:54.800> very

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
this thing is definitely very small very

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.130 
this thing is definitely very small very
small<00:00:55.920> form<00:00:56.460> factor<00:00:56.660> in<00:00:57.660> terms<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:58.079> thickness

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
small form factor in terms of thickness

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.020 
small form factor in terms of thickness
it<00:01:01.140> was<00:01:01.350> thicker<00:01:01.649> than<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:02.039> expected<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.910> be

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
it was thicker than I expected it to be

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.990 
it was thicker than I expected it to be
but<00:01:03.989> it's<00:01:04.170> definitely<00:01:04.409> an<00:01:05.040> extremely<00:01:05.729> small

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
but it's definitely an extremely small

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.280 
but it's definitely an extremely small
machine<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.479> actually<00:01:06.810> even<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.170> this

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
machine and actually even in this

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.230 
machine and actually even in this
letting<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.680> starts<00:01:07.890> adult<00:01:08.130> right<00:01:08.280> there<00:01:08.460> BAM

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
letting it starts adult right there BAM

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.000 
letting it starts adult right there BAM
you'll<00:01:09.479> see<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.780> beginning<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.770> Bulge

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
you'll see the beginning of the Bulge

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.580 
you'll see the beginning of the Bulge
there's<00:01:11.670> kind<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:11.939> like<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.150> bulge<00:01:12.409> at<00:01:13.409> the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
there's kind of like a bulge at the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.249 
there's kind of like a bulge at the
bottom<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.100> didn't<00:01:14.700> expect<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.150> see<00:01:15.270> but

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
use so you see the logo and then here it

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
after improvements like here is a

hundred percent but I've got nothing
going<00:05:18.320> on<00:05:18.530> but<00:05:19.930> even<00:05:20.930> with<00:05:21.080> improvements<00:05:21.650> like

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
going on but even with improvements like

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.529 
going on but even with improvements like
the<00:05:21.919> drivers<00:05:22.370> the<00:05:22.580> audio<00:05:22.849> is<00:05:22.910> not<00:05:23.240> that<00:05:23.389> great

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:23.539
