00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.750
 jean-pierre jeunet the return

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.610
 what I did some colors what refute of turquoise internet archos 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.960
 a foreign agent 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.070

 people were nothing 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.030
 when I saw that I had explained 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.570
 but for his detractors 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:00.900
 relay 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.900
 he points that are of a rare violence 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.780
 completely in swiss 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.670
 according to 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.409
 5 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:11.889
 completely 

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:13.749
 6 6 shops 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:17.010
 So here I created my texture so in georgia 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.089
 if i could make it william r 

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:23.709
 we will see well beyond the milan continues it's gone 

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:27.469
 meetings we have three children 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:30.469
 this is to complete the right to reply 

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:35.759
 Well, I'm going to set up my business 

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:37.299
 m 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.389
 that's what I would put a handbrake now 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:43.119
 mr m 

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:46.949
 why the dead weight do it I know well 

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:49.659
 the given agreement 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:51.499
 he is priest is 1 to 0 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:54.419
 we start from scratch not to do 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:57.270
 3 similarly your area and then 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.779
 the booth in three languages 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:02:59.630
 2 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.129
 at 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.069
 the pitch &amp; putt rotation to the balls 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.129
 that's why he's like that 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:10.670
 I am going to put off him and of course he is burgoin 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.989
 so there the boss of the department 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.319
 we have many more than the shining patrol 

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:24.479
 here is in section 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.119
 now plan to do as long as he loves to follow them 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.039
 so this way so it's you who have to decide 

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:38.669
 with all our free platforms the kiss finally with all the tools are 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:40.519
 the 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.519
 especially as anyone who claims first shield 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:48.919
 so I'm going to put in for a referral first place these detours 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:52.119
 for example I want the face to face 

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:54.829
 I still have to race 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:58.309
 this was a little bit 

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:00.579
 I am somewhere 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:01.819
 gerard progress 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.859
 ezekiel short formats 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.930
 that's why we'll see after more than 600 francs for and against 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:10.989
 that's why I created percent 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.069
 from Morocco the respondent from January he said 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.959
 so there say it but for now no doubt that what was created 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.239
 why so much for the club wanted to pursue this city 

00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:24.749
 so why 

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:27.810
 in fact right click on the 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:28.939
 property 

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:31.180
 4d g cinema 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.259
 saturday lined up on the lawn for kate moss created 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:38.469
 our size foot why 

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:40.870
 nice was breathing so at the same time 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.390
 so we see 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.700
 the characteristics in direct and real direct doubt 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:49.709
 it's the only one who explains the ball the 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.599
 for traveling 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:55.709
 in fact the news the plot must follow we will tell him that they must 

00:04:55.709 --> 00:04:58.709
 wander quétier this plot there a lot to move it 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.280
 and so there 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.430
 in another post is removed on the title passes it's not very well seen but 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:06.569
 good 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:08.089
 the most remote 

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:12.759
 and so now complete the podium what she does both 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:14.430
 drivers on keyboards 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.909
 it does not work 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:19.419
 so in fact to vary the position 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.330
 of the 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.330
 of the sphere we will take back the tribe 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:28.400
 it is active and therefore we propose 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.400
 1-0 percent that means he was going all the way to the beginning 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.770
 québec in questions yet here it is all at once 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.599
 on the contrary it's a magnitude the genesis it follows 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:42.639
 to prevent that so at the beginning of our world 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:44.680
 our position 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.960
 2 the 0% position to create a key to savor that fact that its 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.259
 control 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.479
 and since I was little, I have listened to my position 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:55.639
 in the end 0 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:57.520
 Tamazight 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.960
 the position here why am I rather going to you at 90 I would like it to be the 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.229
 position at 100% 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:08.449
 and the same to create a key to complete his control to critics 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:11.189
 here and so this site 

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:12.669
 créteil 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:15.750
 we must be familiar with the study 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.839
 on the other hand 

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:20.199
 here you can create% 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:22.969
 you can rate more 2 

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:26.859
 All other kinds previous watercat recipient card 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.589
 a lot of things except that it's a man 

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:33.539
 eqType ...% 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:34.960
 it was % 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.650
 we will take part 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.150
 a bulimia of following the princess 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.869
 for roland 

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:45.110
 I think that's all 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.110
 if you have questions where you leave comments 

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:54.469
 eqtype ...% for those who listen to this tutorial outside 

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:57.469
 I would be learning 

00:06:59.309 --> 00:07:01.379
 we fill little by little 

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:04.840
 in fact I could do business before the school year the cedh indicates 

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:06.289

 for and command I speak 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.110
 this afternoon 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.770
 the stimulus interviewer 

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:19.150
