relationship<00:02:28.900> of<00:02:29.140> sports<00:02:29.590> car<00:02:29.859> and<00:02:30.010> pickup

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
relationship of sports car and pickup

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:50.490 
relationship of sports car and pickup
truck

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.470 

now<00:02:50.860> keep<00:02:51.010> in<00:02:51.130> mind<00:02:51.340> I<00:02:51.490> did<00:02:51.670> sneak<00:02:52.000> this<00:02:52.180> truck

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
now keep in mind I did sneak this truck

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.160 
now keep in mind I did sneak this truck
out<00:02:52.660> of<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.370> resort<00:02:54.370> because<00:02:54.720> well<00:02:55.720> I<00:02:55.750> could

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
out of the resort because well I could

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.470 
out of the resort because well I could
and<00:02:56.500> so<00:02:57.220> this<00:02:57.430> is<00:02:57.580> a<00:02:57.610> very<00:02:58.060> impromptu

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
and so this is a very impromptu

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.420 
and so this is a very impromptu
zero-to-sixty<00:02:59.020> all<00:02:59.500> you<00:02:59.710> to<00:02:59.830> do<00:02:59.950> is<00:02:59.980> find<00:03:00.280> a

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
zero-to-sixty all you to do is find a

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.550 
zero-to-sixty all you to do is find a
straight<00:03:00.730> pin<00:03:00.880> a<00:03:00.940> road<00:03:01.150> we<00:03:01.660> are<00:03:01.690> in<00:03:02.080> Austin

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
straight pin a road we are in Austin

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.000 
straight pin a road we are in Austin
Texas

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
Texas

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.760 
Texas
it<00:03:03.130> is<00:03:03.400> crazy<00:03:04.150> hot<00:03:04.480> out<00:03:04.630> there<00:03:04.660> I'm<00:03:05.470> going<00:03:05.680> to

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
it is crazy hot out there I'm going to

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.160 
it is crazy hot out there I'm going to
say<00:03:05.920> 95<00:03:06.640> degrees<00:03:07.060> which<00:03:07.360> is<00:03:07.390> pretty<00:03:07.840> warm<00:03:08.020> so

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
say 95 degrees which is pretty warm so

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.630 
say 95 degrees which is pretty warm so
that's<00:03:08.410> going<00:03:08.530> to<00:03:08.620> affect<00:03:08.710> the<00:03:08.920> 0<00:03:09.130> to<00:03:09.220> 60<00:03:09.490> time

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
that's going to affect the 0 to 60 time

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.550 
that's going to affect the 0 to 60 time
and<00:03:09.970> we're<00:03:10.600> going<00:03:10.720> to<00:03:10.750> find<00:03:10.930> a<00:03:11.050> stripe<00:03:11.380> in<00:03:11.500> a

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
and we're going to find a stripe in a

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.710 
and we're going to find a stripe in a
road<00:03:11.800> and<00:03:12.430> I'm<00:03:12.640> going<00:03:12.790> to<00:03:12.820> just<00:03:13.000> floor<00:03:13.420> it<00:03:13.450> and

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
road and I'm going to just floor it and

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.680 
road and I'm going to just floor it and
see<00:03:14.350> if<00:03:14.770> this<00:03:15.280> truck<00:03:15.580> will<00:03:15.790> break<00:03:16.090> what<00:03:16.540> do<00:03:16.600> you

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
see if this truck will break what do you

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.690 
see if this truck will break what do you
think<00:03:16.870> 8<00:03:17.080> seconds<00:03:17.560> should<00:03:17.980> do<00:03:18.100> that<00:03:18.250> right<00:03:18.310> I

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
think 8 seconds should do that right I

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.080 
think 8 seconds should do that right I
bet<00:03:19.690> you'll<00:03:19.840> do<00:03:19.960> that<00:03:20.080> 420<00:03:20.680> horsepower<00:03:21.090> 460

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
bet you'll do that 420 horsepower 460

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.490 
bet you'll do that 420 horsepower 460
pound<00:03:22.390> for<00:03:22.600> the<00:03:22.660> torque<00:03:22.930> that's<00:03:23.140> a<00:03:23.260> lot<00:03:23.470> of

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
pound for the torque that's a lot of

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.640 
pound for the torque that's a lot of
power<00:03:23.800> I<00:03:24.100> bet<00:03:24.730> you<00:03:24.940> eight<00:03:25.720> seconds<00:03:26.230> will<00:03:26.380> fall

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
power I bet you eight seconds will fall

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.260 
power I bet you eight seconds will fall
now<00:03:26.980> it's<00:03:27.130> just<00:03:27.280> a<00:03:27.370> question<00:03:27.760> of<00:03:27.850> finding<00:03:28.180> a

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
now it's just a question of finding a

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.030 
now it's just a question of finding a
straight<00:03:28.510> bit<00:03:28.690> of<00:03:28.780> road<00:03:28.990> and<00:03:29.230> a<00:03:29.620> straight<00:03:29.860> bit

of legal Road where I can let this

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:42.750

really hard to find a straight bit of

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.260 
really hard to find a straight bit of
road<00:03:45.560> but<00:03:45.740> I<00:03:45.770> found<00:03:46.160> it<00:03:46.430> so<00:03:46.910> now<00:03:47.060> I'm<00:03:47.150> just

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.210 
possible to use all those horses and

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.780 
possible to use all those horses and
here<00:03:53.480> we<00:03:53.570> go<00:03:54.220> alright<00:03:55.220> oh<00:03:55.610> how<00:03:56.450> do<00:03:56.510> we<00:03:56.660> spend

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.310 

seven<00:04:09.770> point<00:04:10.250> six<00:04:10.760> one<00:04:11.120> and<00:04:11.450> that<00:04:11.900> is<00:04:12.110> not

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
seven point six one and that is not

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.130 
seven point six one and that is not
using<00:04:12.709> all<00:04:13.580> or<00:04:14.000> four<00:04:14.270> wheel<00:04:14.450> drive<00:04:14.780> and<00:04:15.080> that

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
using all or four wheel drive and that

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
using all or four wheel drive and that
is<00:04:15.530> not<00:04:15.830> using<00:04:16.930> probably<00:04:17.930> the<00:04:18.410> best<00:04:18.709> surface

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
is not using probably the best surface

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.720 
is not using probably the best surface
attainable<00:04:19.850> for<00:04:20.660> this<00:04:20.870> pickup<00:04:21.470> so<00:04:21.709> it's<00:04:21.980> very

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
attainable for this pickup so it's very

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.180 
attainable for this pickup so it's very
fast<00:04:23.120> I<00:04:23.570> have<00:04:24.020> no<00:04:24.230> doubt<00:04:24.440> that<00:04:24.710> this<00:04:24.830> pickup

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
fast I have no doubt that this pickup

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.760 
fast I have no doubt that this pickup
would<00:04:25.340> go<00:04:25.490> under<00:04:25.970> seven<00:04:26.960> seconds<00:04:27.350> given<00:04:27.650> the

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
would go under seven seconds given the

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.340 
would go under seven seconds given the
right<00:04:27.950> conditions<00:04:28.940> which<00:04:29.600> I<00:04:29.780> don't<00:04:29.840> have<00:04:30.140> here
