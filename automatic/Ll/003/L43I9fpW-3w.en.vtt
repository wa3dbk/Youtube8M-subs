don't already have something by that

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.030 
don't already have something by that

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:33.390 
insert it in there and that's the reason

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.340 
insert it in there and that's the reason
why<00:06:33.420> you<00:06:33.600> need<00:06:33.930> to<00:06:34.110> use<00:06:34.410> a<00:06:35.930> three-ring<00:06:36.930> binder

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:37.350 
why you need to use a three-ring binder

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.310 
why you need to use a three-ring binder
type<00:06:37.620> thing<00:06:37.890> that<00:06:38.370> way<00:06:38.520> you<00:06:38.580> can<00:06:38.790> open<00:06:39.210> it<00:06:39.300> up

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.320 
type thing that way you can open it up

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.500 
type thing that way you can open it up
add<00:06:40.470> pages<00:06:41.010> exactly<00:06:41.820> where<00:06:42.000> you<00:06:42.120> want<00:06:42.390> it

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:42.510 
add pages exactly where you want it

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:43.930 
add pages exactly where you want it
whereas<00:06:42.810> if<00:06:42.990> you<00:06:43.110> used<00:06:43.260> a<00:06:43.410> spiral<00:06:43.860> notebook

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:43.940 
whereas if you used a spiral notebook

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.940 
whereas if you used a spiral notebook
you'd<00:06:44.940> have<00:06:45.150> to<00:06:45.210> keep<00:06:45.870> rewriting<00:06:46.470> it<00:06:46.800> and

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:46.950 
you'd have to keep rewriting it and

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.560 
you'd have to keep rewriting it and
Reese<00:06:47.130> watching<00:06:47.640> it<00:06:47.760> over<00:06:47.880> and<00:06:48.120> over<00:06:48.330> again

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:48.570 
Reese watching it over and over again

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.560 
Reese watching it over and over again
but<00:06:49.320> I<00:06:49.500> think<00:06:49.890> that<00:06:49.980> this<00:06:50.580> is<00:06:50.640> going<00:06:50.940> to<00:06:51.240> be<00:06:51.390> a

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:51.570 
but I think that this is going to be a

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.110 
but I think that this is going to be a
handy<00:06:52.230> tool<00:06:52.470> to<00:06:52.530> have<00:06:52.800> it's<00:06:53.400> going<00:06:53.640> to<00:06:53.700> just<00:06:53.880> be

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 
handy tool to have it's going to just be

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.540 
handy tool to have it's going to just be
a<00:06:54.150> lot<00:06:54.570> of<00:06:54.720> fun<00:06:55.050> to<00:06:55.800> be<00:06:55.950> able<00:06:56.040> to<00:06:56.310> look<00:06:56.490> through

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:56.550 
a lot of fun to be able to look through

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.330 
a lot of fun to be able to look through
it<00:06:56.820> and<00:06:57.150> compare<00:06:57.630> the<00:06:57.780> colors<00:06:58.110> that<00:06:58.140> way<00:06:58.590> it's

00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.340 
it and compare the colors that way it's

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.430 
it and compare the colors that way it's
just<00:06:59.490> a<00:06:59.760> lot<00:07:00.060> easier<00:07:00.360> to<00:07:00.960> flip<00:07:01.170> through<00:07:01.350> pages

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 
just a lot easier to flip through pages

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.430 
just a lot easier to flip through pages
in<00:07:01.920> a<00:07:02.010> notebook<00:07:02.250> than<00:07:02.640> it<00:07:02.790> is<00:07:02.940> to<00:07:03.180> go<00:07:03.390> over<00:07:04.290> to

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:04.440 
in a notebook than it is to go over to

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.290 
in a notebook than it is to go over to
where<00:07:04.620> the<00:07:04.650> collection<00:07:05.280> is<00:07:05.430> and<00:07:05.730> then<00:07:05.880> start

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:06.300 
where the collection is and then start

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.210 
where the collection is and then start
trying<00:07:06.630> to<00:07:06.810> find<00:07:07.080> different<00:07:07.200> bottles<00:07:07.920> and

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:08.220 
trying to find different bottles and

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.810 
trying to find different bottles and
everything<00:07:08.840> I<00:07:09.840> find<00:07:10.470> that<00:07:10.800> when<00:07:10.860> I'm<00:07:11.340> looking

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:11.820 
everything I find that when I'm looking

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.420 
everything I find that when I'm looking
for<00:07:12.090> specific<00:07:12.720> bottles<00:07:13.080> of<00:07:13.260> nail<00:07:13.440> polish<00:07:13.710> the

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:14.430 
for specific bottles of nail polish the

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:18.740 
for specific bottles of nail polish the
lighting<00:07:14.940> is<00:07:15.980> not<00:07:16.980> so<00:07:17.340> great<00:07:17.670> in<00:07:17.940> the<00:07:18.300> shelf

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:18.750 
lighting is not so great in the shelf

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:21.380 
lighting is not so great in the shelf
units<00:07:19.200> that<00:07:19.350> I<00:07:19.380> have<00:07:19.680> so<00:07:20.160> it's<00:07:20.190> not<00:07:21.120> always

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:21.390 
units that I have so it's not always

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.690 
units that I have so it's not always
easy<00:07:21.570> to<00:07:21.900> find<00:07:22.230> the<00:07:22.470> right<00:07:22.620> color<00:07:22.920> or<00:07:23.250> anything

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:23.700 
easy to find the right color or anything

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.730 
easy to find the right color or anything
like<00:07:23.730> that<00:07:23.940> so<00:07:24.690> having<00:07:24.960> everything<00:07:25.380> in<00:07:25.650> a

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:25.740 
like that so having everything in a

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.580 
like that so having everything in a
notebook<00:07:26.070> is<00:07:26.610> going<00:07:27.360> to<00:07:27.450> be<00:07:27.570> a<00:07:27.600> lot<00:07:27.930> easier<00:07:28.200> and

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:28.590 
notebook is going to be a lot easier and

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.560 
notebook is going to be a lot easier and
I<00:07:28.860> think<00:07:29.460> a<00:07:29.580> lot<00:07:29.610> of<00:07:29.820> people<00:07:29.970> would<00:07:30.390> get

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:30.570 
I think a lot of people would get

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.870 
I think a lot of people would get
enjoyment<00:07:31.020> out<00:07:31.230> of<00:07:31.500> owning<00:07:32.100> something<00:07:32.550> like

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 
enjoyment out of owning something like

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.030 
enjoyment out of owning something like
this<00:07:33.120> so<00:07:33.780> if<00:07:33.900> you<00:07:34.020> have<00:07:34.170> any<00:07:34.320> questions<00:07:34.890> if

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:35.040 
this so if you have any questions if

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.460 
this so if you have any questions if
there's<00:07:35.250> anything<00:07:35.520> that<00:07:35.670> I<00:07:35.880> didn't<00:07:36.210> cover<00:07:36.600> let

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:37.470 
there's anything that I didn't cover let

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.370 
there's anything that I didn't cover let
me<00:07:37.650> know<00:07:37.830> and<00:07:38.160> I<00:07:38.880> will<00:07:39.420> see<00:07:39.930> you<00:07:39.960> in<00:07:40.140> the<00:07:40.170> next
