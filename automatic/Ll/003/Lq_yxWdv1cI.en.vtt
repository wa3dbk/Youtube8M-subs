stall the sliding shelf on the first

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.669 
stall the sliding shelf on the first
thing<00:00:09.570> you're<00:00:09.690> going<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:09.870> do<00:00:10.050> is<00:00:10.320> take<00:00:10.559> your

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
thing you're going to do is take your

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.730 
thing you're going to do is take your
brackets<00:00:11.160> and<00:00:11.429> place<00:00:11.759> them<00:00:12.000> approximately

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
brackets and place them approximately

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.230 
brackets and place them approximately
apart<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.950> distance<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.700> shelf

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
apart the distance of the shelf

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.000 
apart the distance of the shelf
once<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:15.870> bracket<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.590> placed

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
once that bracket is placed

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.730 
once that bracket is placed
approximately<00:00:17.420> with<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.810> wheels<00:00:19.170> forward

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
approximately with the wheels forward

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.160 
approximately with the wheels forward
notice<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.789> wheels<00:00:21.000> forward<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.720> no<00:00:21.900> wheels

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
notice the wheels forward and no wheels

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.810 
notice the wheels forward and no wheels
in<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.380> back<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.769> bracket<00:00:23.160> you're<00:00:23.670> going

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
in the back of the bracket you're going

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.800 
in the back of the bracket you're going
to<00:00:23.880> gently<00:00:24.619> place<00:00:25.619> your<00:00:25.740> shelf<00:00:26.510> into<00:00:27.510> the

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
to gently place your shelf into the

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.990 
to gently place your shelf into the
brackets<00:00:28.289> so<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.470> can<00:00:28.710> just<00:00:28.890> gauge<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:29.880> it's

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
brackets so you can just gauge that it's

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.900 
brackets so you can just gauge that it's
the<00:00:30.119> right<00:00:30.300> distance<00:00:30.689> apart<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.730> make<00:00:32.730> sure

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
the right distance apart and make sure

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.850 
the right distance apart and make sure
that<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.210> alignment<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:33.809> great<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.469> when

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
that the alignment is great that it when

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.770 
that the alignment is great that it when
it<00:00:34.980> slides<00:00:35.160> out<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.670> doesn't<00:00:35.969> hit<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.329> the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
it slides out it doesn't hit the the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.569 
it slides out it doesn't hit the the
hinge<00:00:37.079> at<00:00:37.260> all<00:00:37.440> or<00:00:37.620> any<00:00:37.800> other<00:00:38.040> obstructions

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.700 
hinge at all or any other obstructions
you<00:00:38.670> might<00:00:38.910> have<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.270> place<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.440> first

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
you might have in place so the first

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.350 
you might have in place so the first
thing<00:00:40.890> we're<00:00:41.010> going<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.219> do<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.579> install<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:42.149> is

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
thing we're going to do to install it is

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.720 
thing we're going to do to install it is
once<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.290> have<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.590> alignment<00:00:43.829> correct<00:00:44.489> and

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
once you have the alignment correct and

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.760 
once you have the alignment correct and
it<00:00:44.820> slides<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.570> out<00:00:45.719> easily<00:00:46.350> with<00:00:46.739> your

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
it slides in and out easily with your

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.720 
it slides in and out easily with your
shelf<00:00:47.520> lights<00:00:47.789> you're<00:00:48.300> going<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.739> gently<00:00:49.739> pull

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
shelf lights you're going to gently pull

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.600 
shelf lights you're going to gently pull
the<00:00:50.789> shell<00:00:51.030> part<00:00:51.899> way<00:00:52.110> out<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.770> exposes<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
the shell part way out so it exposes the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.540 
the shell part way out so it exposes the
back<00:00:53.820> brackets<00:00:54.539> once<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.469> back<00:00:55.680> brackets<00:00:56.340> are

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
back brackets once the back brackets are

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.000 
back brackets once the back brackets are
exposed<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.750> can<00:00:57.930> then<00:00:58.170> start<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.559> drill<00:00:58.890> your

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
exposed you can then start to drill your

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.069 
exposed you can then start to drill your
holes<00:00:59.280> as<00:00:59.579> used<00:00:59.789> as<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.420> see<00:01:00.660> I've<00:01:00.780> already

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
holes as used as you see I've already

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.310 
holes as used as you see I've already
drilled<00:01:01.559> my<00:01:01.829> holes<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.969> inserted<00:01:03.750> my<00:01:03.899> screws

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
drilled my holes and inserted my screws

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.560 
drilled my holes and inserted my screws
but<00:01:05.100> what<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.430> would<00:01:05.549> do<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:06.060> on<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.360> right

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
but what you would do is on the right

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.320 
but what you would do is on the right
side<00:01:06.900> drill<00:01:07.590> one<00:01:07.860> hole<00:01:07.890> or<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.850> can<00:01:09.000> mark<00:01:09.210> it

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
side drill one hole or you can mark it

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.840 
side drill one hole or you can mark it
and<00:01:09.540> then<00:01:09.750> drill<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.260> put<00:01:11.070> one<00:01:11.280> screw<00:01:11.640> in

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
and then drill it and put one screw in

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.700 
and then drill it and put one screw in
then<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.479> would<00:01:12.600> go<00:01:12.780> on<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.170> left<00:01:13.409> side

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
then you would go on to the left side

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.880 
then you would go on to the left side
and<00:01:14.060> mark<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.390> put<00:01:15.720> one<00:01:15.960> screw<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.380> and

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
and mark it and put one screw in and

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.010 
and mark it and put one screw in and
then<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.280> could<00:01:17.460> do<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.820> with<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.180> next<00:01:18.780> side

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
then you could do it with the next side

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.109 
then you could do it with the next side
for<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:19.740> we<00:01:19.950> have<00:01:20.130> two<00:01:20.369> screws<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.939> the

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
for it so we have two screws and the

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.820 
for it so we have two screws and the
other<00:01:21.299> side<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.960> would<00:01:22.110> have<00:01:22.259> two<00:01:22.500> screws

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
other side so it would have two screws

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.039 
other side so it would have two screws
and<00:01:23.100> two<00:01:23.460> screws<00:01:23.759> are<00:01:23.939> really<00:01:24.210> all<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.570> need<00:01:24.600> I

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
and two screws are really all you need I

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.320 
and two screws are really all you need I
put<00:01:25.590> three<00:01:25.860> screws<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.549> because<00:01:27.119> it's

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
put three screws in this because it's

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.510 
put three screws in this because it's
been<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.479> slightly<00:01:28.259> bigger<00:01:28.619> shelf<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.310> it's

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
been a slightly bigger shelf and it's

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.730 
been a slightly bigger shelf and it's
gonna<00:01:29.670> hold<00:01:29.909> more<00:01:30.180> weight<00:01:30.390> once<00:01:31.380> you're<00:01:31.560> back

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
gonna hold more weight once you're back

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.460 
gonna hold more weight once you're back
shelves<00:01:32.280> are<00:01:32.430> in<00:01:32.790> place<00:01:33.090> what<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.020> would<00:01:34.290> do

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
shelves are in place what you would do

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.830 
shelves are in place what you would do
is<00:01:34.740> make<00:01:34.770> sure<00:01:35.009> check<00:01:35.430> your<00:01:35.640> alignment<00:01:35.840> then

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
is make sure check your alignment then

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.780 
is make sure check your alignment then
remember<00:01:37.259> your<00:01:37.380> front<00:01:37.680> poles<00:01:38.549> are<00:01:38.759> not

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
remember your front poles are not

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.300 
remember your front poles are not
attached<00:01:39.299> yet<00:01:39.659> check<00:01:40.290> your<00:01:40.500> alignment<00:01:40.590> and

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
attached yet check your alignment and

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.280 
attached yet check your alignment and
once<00:01:41.820> you're<00:01:42.000> sure<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.780> alignment<00:01:43.049> is

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
once you're sure that the alignment is

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.039

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
and as you can see I have done the three

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.930 
and as you can see I have done the three
on<00:02:14.410> both<00:02:14.590> sides<00:02:14.860> just<00:02:15.130> because<00:02:15.610> this<00:02:15.790> is<00:02:15.910> a

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
on both sides just because this is a

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.660 
on both sides just because this is a
bigger<00:02:16.210> step<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:16.750> will<00:02:16.840> hold<00:02:17.020> more<00:02:17.290> weight

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
bigger step and will hold more weight

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.340 
bigger step and will hold more weight
once<00:02:18.670> that's<00:02:19.000> all<00:02:19.270> done<00:02:19.300> with<00:02:19.930> your<00:02:20.110> pool

once that's all done with your pool
shelf<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:21.160> will<00:02:21.340> then<00:02:23.010> insert<00:02:24.010> your<00:02:24.190> drawer

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
shelf you will then insert your drawer

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.360 
shelf you will then insert your drawer
and<00:02:24.880> slide<00:02:25.270> it<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:26.080> make<00:02:26.260> sure<00:02:26.290> that<00:02:26.680> it<00:02:27.040> still

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
and slide it to make sure that it still

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.170 
and slide it to make sure that it still
is<00:02:27.760> correct<00:02:28.540> alignment<00:02:29.170> and<00:02:29.820> slides<00:02:30.820> easily

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
is correct alignment and slides easily

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.720 
is correct alignment and slides easily
in<00:02:31.570> and<00:02:31.810> out<00:02:31.930> if<00:02:32.320> for<00:02:32.710> some<00:02:32.740> reason<00:02:33.250> it<00:02:33.340> didn't

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
in and out if for some reason it didn't

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.360 
in and out if for some reason it didn't
you<00:02:34.090> would<00:02:34.210> adjust<00:02:34.390> one<00:02:35.050> side<00:02:35.410> and<00:02:35.890> that's<00:02:36.280> the

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
you would adjust one side and that's the

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.800 
you would adjust one side and that's the
left<00:02:36.640> side<00:02:36.880> that<00:02:37.150> would<00:02:37.360> be<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.570> preferable

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
left side that would be the preferable

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.000 
left side that would be the preferable
one<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:38.920> you<00:02:39.040> can<00:02:39.190> unscrew<00:02:39.880> or<00:02:40.240> you<00:02:40.630> can

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
one and you can unscrew or you can

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.260 
one and you can unscrew or you can
completely<00:02:42.010> drill<00:02:42.340> another<00:02:42.550> hole<00:02:42.670> if<00:02:43.120> you

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
completely drill another hole if you

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.170 
completely drill another hole if you
have<00:02:43.510> to<00:02:43.780> but<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.380> holes<00:02:45.130> and<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.460> alignments

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
have to but the holes and the alignments

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.290 
have to but the holes and the alignments
and<00:02:46.360> the<00:02:46.540> brackets<00:02:47.080> are<00:02:47.260> made<00:02:47.670> so<00:02:48.670> it's<00:02:48.790> very

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
and the brackets are made so it's very

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.450 
and the brackets are made so it's very
easily<00:02:49.660> adjusted<00:02:50.470> from<00:02:50.590> side<00:02:50.830> to<00:02:50.860> side<00:02:51.040> or

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
easily adjusted from side to side or

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.760 
easily adjusted from side to side or
from<00:02:51.610> up<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:51.910> down<00:02:52.120> so<00:02:53.080> that's<00:02:53.290> your<00:02:53.530> full

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
from up and down so that's your full
