drive the car home does that make sense
that<00:01:43.110> make<00:01:43.649> sense

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
that make sense

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030

but<00:01:47.990> back<00:01:48.740> to<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.040> mac<00:01:49.190> pro<00:01:49.400> i<00:01:49.900> am<00:01:50.900> absolutely

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
but back to the mac pro i am absolutely

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.420 
but back to the mac pro i am absolutely
loving<00:01:52.100> the<00:01:52.820> new<00:01:53.000> mac<00:01:53.240> pro<00:01:53.270> he's<00:01:53.810> so<00:01:54.320> fast<00:01:54.950> i

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
loving the new mac pro he's so fast i

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.330 
loving the new mac pro he's so fast i
mean<00:01:56.030> when<00:01:56.810> you<00:01:56.840> use<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.290> retina<00:01:57.710> macbook<00:01:58.070> pro

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
mean when you use the retina macbook pro

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.570 
mean when you use the retina macbook pro
it's<00:01:59.090> not<00:01:59.770> hugely<00:02:00.770> different<00:02:01.070> from<00:02:01.400> that<00:02:01.430> I

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
it's not hugely different from that I

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.750 
it's not hugely different from that I
guess<00:02:01.880> insult<00:02:02.330> every<00:02:02.750> day<00:02:02.930> stuff<00:02:03.320> but<00:02:03.760> from

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
guess insult every day stuff but from

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.180 
guess insult every day stuff but from
the<00:02:05.240> machine<00:02:05.540> that<00:02:05.660> I<00:02:05.720> use<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:05.990> most<00:02:06.170> which<00:02:07.160> is

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
the machine that I use the most which is

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.990 
the machine that I use the most which is
my<00:02:07.880> old<00:02:08.060> Mac<00:02:08.360> Pro<00:02:08.660> is<00:02:09.220> ridiculously<00:02:10.220> different

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
my old Mac Pro is ridiculously different

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.450 
my old Mac Pro is ridiculously different
the<00:02:11.660> old<00:02:11.810> Mac<00:02:11.990> Pro<00:02:12.200> is<00:02:12.230> very<00:02:12.740> very<00:02:12.920> quiet<00:02:13.220> I

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
the old Mac Pro is very very quiet I

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.250 
the old Mac Pro is very very quiet I
never<00:02:13.700> thought<00:02:14.000> I<00:02:14.030> could<00:02:14.150> hear<00:02:14.570> it<00:02:14.690> but<00:02:15.110> now

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
never thought I could hear it but now

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.990 
never thought I could hear it but now
I've<00:02:15.410> got<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:15.680> new<00:02:15.890> Mac<00:02:16.160> Pro<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.790> most

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
I've got the new Mac Pro the most

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.400 
I've got the new Mac Pro the most
incredible<00:02:17.630> thing<00:02:17.870> about<00:02:17.900> it<00:02:18.260> is<00:02:18.380> the

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
incredible thing about it is the

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.650 
incredible thing about it is the
quietness<00:02:19.100> of<00:02:19.160> it<00:02:19.520> and<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:20.090> lack<00:02:20.300> of<00:02:20.330> heat

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
quietness of it and the lack of heat

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.450 
quietness of it and the lack of heat
kicks<00:02:21.170> out<00:02:21.410> it<00:02:21.800> is<00:02:22.010> just<00:02:22.250> absolutely<00:02:22.870> silent

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
kicks out it is just absolutely silent

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
it I haven't made any decisions yet as

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.600 
it I haven't made any decisions yet as
to<00:02:41.510> whether<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:42.020> cancel<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.620> 12<00:02:42.890> core<00:02:43.220> ever<00:02:43.459> to

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
to whether to cancel the 12 core ever to

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.250 
to whether to cancel the 12 core ever to
wait<00:02:43.790> for<00:02:44.000> it<00:02:44.030> to<00:02:44.090> come<00:02:44.300> I<00:02:44.540> haven't<00:02:44.930> made<00:02:45.050> any

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
wait for it to come I haven't made any

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.449 
wait for it to come I haven't made any
decisions<00:02:45.290> yet<00:02:45.680> i'm<00:02:45.830> going<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:46.010> use<00:02:46.130> it<00:02:46.280> for<00:02:46.310> a

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
decisions yet i'm going to use it for a

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:47.980 
decisions yet i'm going to use it for a
little<00:02:46.550> bit<00:02:46.640> longer<00:02:46.880> and<00:02:47.450> I<00:02:47.570> really<00:02:47.870> won't

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
little bit longer and I really won't

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.120 
little bit longer and I really won't
know<00:02:48.140> that<00:02:48.470> until<00:02:48.739> I<00:02:49.010> start<00:02:49.400> encoding<00:02:50.830> 4k<00:02:51.830> is

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
know that until I start encoding 4k is

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.740 
know that until I start encoding 4k is
that<00:02:52.550> is<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.850> big<00:02:53.030> one<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:53.360> seeing<00:02:53.600> how

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
that is the big one and seeing how

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.440 
that is the big one and seeing how
quickly<00:02:54.080> it<00:02:54.709> kind<00:02:54.980> of<00:02:55.040> tears<00:02:55.310> through<00:02:55.640> that<00:02:55.850> so

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
quickly it kind of tears through that so

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.530 
quickly it kind of tears through that so
yeah<00:02:57.440> I'm<00:02:57.830> not<00:02:58.010> sure<00:02:58.250> based<00:02:58.550> on<00:02:58.730> everyday<00:02:59.120> sort

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
yeah I'm not sure based on everyday sort

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.590 
yeah I'm not sure based on everyday sort
of<00:02:59.690> typical<00:03:00.230> single<00:03:00.950> core<00:03:01.310> speeds<00:03:01.730> this<00:03:02.450> is

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
of typical single core speeds this is

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.630 
of typical single core speeds this is
absolutely<00:03:03.230> fine<00:03:03.440> and<00:03:03.500> in<00:03:03.860> fact<00:03:04.040> on<00:03:04.250> single

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
absolutely fine and in fact on single

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.190 
absolutely fine and in fact on single
core<00:03:04.820> speeds<00:03:05.090> would<00:03:05.269> obviously<00:03:05.510> be<00:03:05.660> faster

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
core speeds would obviously be faster

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.410 
core speeds would obviously be faster
than<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:06.560> 12<00:03:07.340> quart<00:03:07.640> just<00:03:07.880> really<00:03:08.090> depends

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
than the 12 quart just really depends

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.110 
than the 12 quart just really depends
how<00:03:08.600> it<00:03:08.870> tears<00:03:09.470> through<00:03:09.830> the<00:03:10.100> rendering<00:03:11.030> of

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
how it tears through the rendering of

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.729 
how it tears through the rendering of
the<00:03:11.150> 4k<00:03:11.630> video<00:03:11.959> and<00:03:12.080> some<00:03:12.200> have<00:03:12.290> a<00:03:12.380> little<00:03:12.590> bits

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
the 4k video and some have a little bits

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.250 
the 4k video and some have a little bits
and<00:03:12.920> pieces<00:03:13.220> as<00:03:13.310> well<00:03:13.340> like<00:03:13.670> I<00:03:13.700> do<00:03:13.959> to<00:03:14.959> do<00:03:15.080> with

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
and pieces as well like I do to do with

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.660 
and pieces as well like I do to do with
like<00:03:15.410> numbers<00:03:15.830> modeling<00:03:16.190> and<00:03:16.340> stuff<00:03:16.430> but

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
like numbers modeling and stuff but

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.810 
like numbers modeling and stuff but
anyway<00:03:17.000> and<00:03:17.980> yes<00:03:18.980> so<00:03:19.250> I<00:03:19.280> am<00:03:19.610> absolutely

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
anyway and yes so I am absolutely

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.050 
anyway and yes so I am absolutely
thrilled<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:21.050> biggest<00:03:21.470> difference<00:03:21.650> is<00:03:22.190> the

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
thrilled the biggest difference is the

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.960 
thrilled the biggest difference is the
quietness<00:03:23.720> and<00:03:24.080> also<00:03:25.070> the<00:03:25.250> fact<00:03:25.489> that<00:03:25.930> the

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
quietness and also the fact that the

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.030 
quietness and also the fact that the

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
graphics cards are so fantastic is no

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.420 
check all of the stats and stuff and the
second<00:04:57.030> choice<00:04:57.450> is<00:04:57.720> a<00:04:58.400> BMW<00:04:59.400> m3<00:05:00.169> a<00:05:01.169> white<00:05:01.710> one<00:05:01.890> so

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.159 
second choice is a BMW m3 a white one so
either<00:05:02.970> one<00:05:03.390> would<00:05:03.540> actually<00:05:03.840> be<00:05:03.960> white<00:05:04.140> and

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
either one would actually be white and

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:07.370 
either one would actually be white and
both<00:05:04.680> would<00:05:05.190> be<00:05:05.370> convertible<00:05:06.300> so<00:05:06.870> that<00:05:07.200> is<00:05:07.350> how

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
both would be convertible so that is how

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.340

much<00:05:07.650> I've<00:05:07.890> narrowed<00:05:08.190> my<00:05:08.370> choices<00:05:08.970> down<00:05:09.810> the

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
much I've narrowed my choices down the

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.630 
much I've narrowed my choices down the
reason<00:05:10.740> I've<00:05:10.860> gone<00:05:11.010> off<00:05:11.190> the<00:05:11.220> porsche

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
reason I've gone off the porsche

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.370 
reason I've gone off the porsche
panamera<00:05:13.070> primarily<00:05:14.070> is<00:05:14.490> because<00:05:15.140> you<00:05:16.140> can't

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
panamera primarily is because you can't

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.560 
panamera primarily is because you can't
get<00:05:16.560> a<00:05:16.590> convertible<00:05:16.919> and<00:05:17.370> kind<00:05:18.210> of<00:05:18.300> thinking

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
get a convertible and kind of thinking

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.120 
get a convertible and kind of thinking
about<00:05:18.810> it<00:05:18.930> more<00:05:19.110> and<00:05:19.169> more<00:05:19.320> and<00:05:19.410> more<00:05:19.560> now<00:05:19.860> date

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
about it more and more and more now date

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.010 
about it more and more and more now date
and<00:05:20.669> not<00:05:20.850> going<00:05:21.030> to<00:05:21.090> have<00:05:21.180> a<00:05:21.210> convertible<00:05:21.870> I

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
and not going to have a convertible I

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.620 
and not going to have a convertible I
really<00:05:22.950> want<00:05:23.130> to<00:05:23.220> have<00:05:23.520> one<00:05:23.700> so<00:05:25.220> yeah<00:05:26.220> so

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
that's kind of why my two choices really

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.690 
that's kind of why my two choices really
are<00:05:29.640> the<00:05:29.760> m3<00:05:30.360> or<00:05:30.660> the<00:05:31.080> new<00:05:31.260> six<00:05:31.650> series<00:05:31.919> but<00:05:32.580> I'm

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
kind of leaning a little bit towards the

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.150 
kind of leaning a little bit towards the
m3<00:05:38.250> and<00:05:38.430> I<00:05:38.460> found<00:05:38.700> once<00:05:38.940> day<00:05:40.160> brand-new
