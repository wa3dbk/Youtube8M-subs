00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:14.799 
experiments I don't think it really

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.580 
experiments I don't think it really
changed<00:00:15.490> necessary<00:00:16.059> but<00:00:16.299> I<00:00:16.420> became<00:00:16.779> a<00:00:17.050> bit

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:17.590 
changed necessary but I became a bit

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.260 
changed necessary but I became a bit
more<00:00:17.830> aware<00:00:18.130> about<00:00:18.189> what<00:00:18.550> I<00:00:18.700> was<00:00:18.910> running<00:00:19.119> on<00:00:19.240> a

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
more aware about what I was running on a

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.290 
more aware about what I was running on a
day<00:00:19.450> to<00:00:19.510> day<00:00:19.599> basis<00:00:20.430> but<00:00:21.430> I<00:00:21.520> still<00:00:21.849> very<00:00:22.210> much

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.300 
day to day basis but I still very much

layers<00:01:31.280> I<00:01:31.990> merely<00:01:32.990> did<00:01:33.350> I<00:01:33.620> think<00:01:34.280> with<00:01:34.400> them<00:01:34.580> I

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
layers I merely did I think with them I

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.910 
layers I merely did I think with them I
don't<00:01:34.910> know<00:01:35.210> it's<00:01:35.330> amazing<00:01:35.600> like<00:01:36.440> wow<00:01:36.680> you

know<00:01:37.040> that's<00:01:37.250> not<00:01:37.490> I<00:01:37.520> swear<00:01:37.670> I<00:01:37.880> think<00:01:37.940> it's

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
know that's not I swear I think it's

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.160 
know that's not I swear I think it's
really<00:01:38.480> kind<00:01:38.600> of<00:01:38.720> evolved<00:01:39.470> and<00:01:40.720> yeah<00:01:41.720> I<00:01:42.020> think

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
really kind of evolved and yeah I think

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.800 
really kind of evolved and yeah I think
it<00:01:42.410> did<00:01:42.530> kind<00:01:42.830> of<00:01:42.860> inspire<00:01:43.220> me<00:01:43.520> to<00:01:43.970> do<00:01:44.300> it<00:01:44.510> as

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
it did kind of inspire me to do it as

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.470 
it did kind of inspire me to do it as
well

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.150
