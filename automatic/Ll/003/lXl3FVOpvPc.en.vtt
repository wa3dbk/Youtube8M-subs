 2 tablespoons of lemon juice half

 half a teaspoon of fresh chives 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.500
 chopped 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.170
 let's start making the sauce 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.620
 ranchera and for this we are going to throw in a 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.560
 small bowl the cream or milk cream and 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.840
 the lemon juice mix well with some 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.790
 rods and then we'll see how the 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.460
 cream thickens a bit due to the action 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.240
 of the acidity of the lemon let stand 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.240
 about 10 minutes 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.310
 after this time we are going to add the 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.470
 mayonnaise 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.730
 the milk that will serve to lighten a 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.700
 little sauce 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:22.600
 onion powder 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.600
 garlic powder 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.490
 the dill a quarter of a teaspoon 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.189
 Salt 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.510
 and finally the half teaspoon of 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:35.790
 chopped fresh chives 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.280
 we mix all the ingredients of 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.410
 so that they are well integrated and 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.230
 we would have our ranchera sauce ready 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.240
 homemade if we see that there is too much 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.610
 thick we can add a little more 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.710
 milk and beat again 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.470
 let's reserve it in the refrigerator 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.410
 to use it now in a pan 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.540
 let's fry the bacon strips is not 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.700
 It is necessary to pour out any oil because it 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.890
 they slow down with their own fat 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.869
 when they begin to lightly 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.759
 golden we remove them on paper 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.759
 absorbent to drain a little 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.340
 then we put the potatoes in the 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.060
 fryer with very hot oil and 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.920
 we fry them until golden brown 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.780
 We advise to make them from several batches already 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.480
 that if we miss many at the same time and 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.700
 we huddled would lower the temperature a lot 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.200
 of the oil and would be known instead of 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.540
 fry it 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.209
 as they get golden 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.230
 We are taking them out and reserving on a 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.230
 dish with absorbent paper 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.420
 we distribute it well for the dish so that 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.459
 absorb the excess oil better and before 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.690
 to cool them down we throw a little 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.940
 Salt 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.220
 We pass them to a dish that is suitable for 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.340
 the oven and once they are placed 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.410
 we tossed ranchera sauce to taste I've 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.990
 thrown a generous amount because in 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.660
 house we like very much 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.280
 then we spread over 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.300
 three quarters of the strips of 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.460
 bacon 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.910
 then we put the mixture of four 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.910
 cheeses 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.530
 and finally the rest of the bacon that 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.960
 We reserve with the preheated oven to 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.910
 200 degrees Celsius and only with heat by 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.790
 up or with the grill if the oven 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.710
 has him put the plate halfway 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.590
 height and bake until it is au gratin 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.900
 the cheese when we see that the cheese is 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.090
 melted out of the oven and already 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.090
 we would have ready to serve our 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.920
 homemade bacon cheese france that are one 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.220
 of the most popular entrants of the 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.750
 restaurant chain hollywood 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.120
 as you have seen it is very easy to do 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.130
 and having the sauce recipe 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.600
 ranchera saved us having to 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.860
 buy it since it's not easy to 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.720
 find 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.150
