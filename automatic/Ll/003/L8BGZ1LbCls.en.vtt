the same exact build and I would be

deviate as he's even scouting at the

but he is also getting some additional

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.550 
but he is also getting some additional
gateways<00:03:13.610> and<00:03:13.880> now<00:03:14.270> we<00:03:14.330> finally<00:03:14.690> see<00:03:14.990> a<00:03:15.020> pylon

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
gateways and now we finally see a pylon

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.290 
gateways and now we finally see a pylon
being<00:03:15.860> placed<00:03:16.070> here<00:03:16.310> check<00:03:16.580> needs<00:03:16.880> to<00:03:17.030> get<00:03:17.180> an

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
additional pylon as soon as he warps in

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.270 
additional pylon as soon as he warps in
four<00:03:20.270> units<00:03:20.720> he<00:03:21.230> will<00:03:21.440> be<00:03:21.470> supplied<00:03:22.010> locked

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
four units he will be supplied locked

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.070 
four units he will be supplied locked
once<00:03:22.640> again<00:03:22.970> army<00:03:23.390> wise<00:03:23.570> you<00:03:23.750> can<00:03:23.870> see<00:03:24.050> that

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
once again army wise you can see that

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.530

more pylons being placed down here and
then<00:03:46.610> another<00:03:46.940> pile<00:03:47.300> on<00:03:47.510> here<00:03:47.930> so<00:03:48.290> he<00:03:48.470> will<00:03:48.650> be

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
then another pile on here so he will be

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.199 
then another pile on here so he will be
able<00:03:48.830> to<00:03:49.100> warm<00:03:49.370> up<00:03:49.520> our<00:03:49.760> meal<00:03:49.910> at<00:03:49.970> a<00:03:50.030> high

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
their way over here all it will take is

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.390 
their way over here all it will take is
one<00:03:53.959> century<00:03:54.260> to<00:03:54.500> try<00:03:54.650> to<00:03:54.709> get<00:03:54.800> a<00:03:54.860> force<00:03:55.160> field

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
one century to try to get a force field

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.820 
one century to try to get a force field
but<00:03:55.850> even<00:03:56.030> if<00:03:56.270> one<00:03:56.510> even<00:03:57.140> if<00:03:57.260> there<00:03:57.380> is<00:03:57.470> a<00:03:57.500> force

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
but even if one even if there is a force

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.050 
but even if one even if there is a force
field<00:03:58.040> and<00:03:58.190> the<00:03:58.280> sucker<00:03:58.489> gets<00:03:58.640> caught<00:03:58.880> in<00:03:58.910> the

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
field and the sucker gets caught in the

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.910 
field and the sucker gets caught in the
wrong<00:03:59.239> side<00:03:59.540> of<00:03:59.720> the<00:03:59.810> tracks<00:03:59.840> once<00:04:00.320> again<00:04:00.560> he

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
wrong side of the tracks once again he

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.290 
wrong side of the tracks once again he
will<00:04:01.100> be<00:04:01.250> able<00:04:01.400> to<00:04:01.550> warp<00:04:01.760> in<00:04:01.850> units<00:04:02.120> right

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
will be able to warp in units right

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.420 
will be able to warp in units right
along<00:04:02.630> that<00:04:02.660> edge<00:04:02.989> as<00:04:03.440> you<00:04:03.620> can<00:04:03.739> see<00:04:03.950> he<00:04:04.190> does

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
along that edge as you can see he does

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.340 
along that edge as you can see he does
have<00:04:04.640> sight<00:04:04.940> into<00:04:05.120> that<00:04:05.270> location<00:04:05.450> there<00:04:06.020> so

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
have sight into that location there so

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.020 
have sight into that location there so

one be one replay between pod and check
and<00:05:25.070> I<00:05:25.460> think<00:05:25.700> what<00:05:25.850> really<00:05:26.030> happened<00:05:26.570> in<00:05:26.810> this

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
and I think what really happened in this

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.790 
and I think what really happened in this
matchup<00:05:27.500> is<00:05:27.890> that<00:05:28.370> as<00:05:28.520> soon<00:05:28.880> as<00:05:29.150> Todd<00:05:29.800> warped

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800

in this one assimilator here check

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.500 
in this one assimilator here check
realized<00:05:33.350> that<00:05:34.100> Todd<00:05:35.000> was<00:05:35.030> going<00:05:35.330> to<00:05:35.390> be

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
realized that Todd was going to be

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.650 
realized that Todd was going to be

behind 75 minerals especially if he knew
that<00:05:38.690> he<00:05:39.050> did<00:05:39.230> not<00:05:39.260> need<00:05:39.710> to<00:05:39.770> get<00:05:40.070> that<00:05:40.280> much

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
that he did not need to get that much

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.220 
that he did not need to get that much
