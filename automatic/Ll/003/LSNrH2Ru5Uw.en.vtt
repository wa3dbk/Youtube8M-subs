00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
mobile devices so that's why the we're

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.930 
mobile devices so that's why the we're
going<00:00:51.199> to<00:00:51.379> shift<00:00:51.649> from<00:00:51.949> the<00:00:52.280> other<00:00:52.550> jockeys

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
going to shift from the other jockeys

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.479 
going to shift from the other jockeys
bring<00:00:53.239> to<00:00:53.480> the<00:00:53.629> office<00:00:53.780> region<00:00:54.379> areas<00:00:54.800> and

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
bring to the office region areas and

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.670 
bring to the office region areas and
also<00:00:55.670> the<00:00:56.030> appropriation<00:00:56.570> area<00:00:56.840> were<00:00:57.170> in

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
also the appropriation area were in

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.590 
also the appropriation area were in
vertical<00:00:58.100> areas<00:00:58.489> just<00:00:59.030> now<00:00:59.269> that<00:00:59.449> we<00:00:59.510> are

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
vertical areas just now that we are

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.180 
vertical areas just now that we are
hitting<00:00:59.809> the<00:00:59.989> chain<00:01:00.350> of<00:01:00.379> the<00:01:00.559> number<00:01:00.949> of<00:01:01.070> the

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
hitting the chain of the number of the

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.970 
hitting the chain of the number of the
computers<00:01:01.789> is<00:01:02.059> decreasing<00:01:02.750> so<00:01:03.590> that's<00:01:03.800> why

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
computers is decreasing so that's why

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.210 
computers is decreasing so that's why
the<00:01:04.040> according<00:01:04.610> to<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:04.970> n<00:01:05.479> IDC<00:01:05.840> report<00:01:06.350> yes

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
the according to the n IDC report yes

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.450 
the according to the n IDC report yes
the<00:01:08.000> sfp<00:01:08.630> single<00:01:09.020> function<00:01:09.200> printer<00:01:09.830> is<00:01:10.040> going

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
the sfp single function printer is going

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.660 
the sfp single function printer is going
down<00:01:10.759> but<00:01:11.360> on<00:01:11.540> the<00:01:11.720> other<00:01:11.780> hand<00:01:11.900> so<00:01:12.650> China<00:01:12.920> MFPs

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
down but on the other hand so China MFPs

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.670 
down but on the other hand so China MFPs
is<00:01:14.030> still<00:01:14.270> growing<00:01:14.479> and<00:01:14.900> also<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:15.439> his

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
is still growing and also the his

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.890 
is still growing and also the his
solution<00:01:16.189> the<00:01:16.340> areas<00:01:16.640> like<00:01:17.060> in<00:01:17.479> a<00:01:17.540> copy<00:01:17.780> of<00:01:17.810> my

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
solution the areas like in a copy of my

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.310 
solution the areas like in a copy of my
picture<00:01:18.320> so<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:19.040> area<00:01:19.159> is<00:01:19.369> very<00:01:19.520> flat<00:01:20.210> so<00:01:21.020> we

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
picture so the area is very flat so we

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.200 
picture so the area is very flat so we
are<00:01:21.409> very<00:01:21.439> interesting<00:01:22.250> to<00:01:22.430> go<00:01:22.670> the<00:01:22.850> areas

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
are very interesting to go the areas

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.230 
are very interesting to go the areas

each other so one thing that I I thought

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.150 
each other so one thing that I I thought
we<00:03:19.110> should<00:03:19.140> do<00:03:19.560> is<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.760> really<00:03:21.000> integrate

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
we should do is to really integrate

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
from each other and compete so we have

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.710
