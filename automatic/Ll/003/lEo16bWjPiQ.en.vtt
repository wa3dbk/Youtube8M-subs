00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:08.780 
change the remote key battery this is

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.919 
change the remote key battery this is
actually<00:00:09.780> pretty<00:00:10.500> simple<00:00:11.809> basically<00:00:12.809> what

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
actually pretty simple basically what

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.140 
actually pretty simple basically what
you<00:00:13.019> want<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.259> do<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.590> just<00:00:14.130> keep<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.759> buttons

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
down when you're opening the case

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.480 
down when you're opening the case
because<00:00:18.539> those<00:00:19.020> buttons<00:00:19.380> they<00:00:19.770> just<00:00:20.010> sit<00:00:20.250> in

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
because those buttons they just sit in

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.609 
because those buttons they just sit in
there<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:20.880> they're<00:00:21.660> going<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:21.900> fall<00:00:22.140> out<00:00:22.350> if

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
there and they're going to fall out if

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.089 
there and they're going to fall out if
you<00:00:22.859> open<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:24.150> other<00:00:24.300> way<00:00:24.539> so<00:00:25.289> there's<00:00:26.010> a

you have to open up the casing to this

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.970 
you have to open up the casing to this
remote<00:00:52.050> unit<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:53.120> you<00:00:54.120> got<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.449> just<00:00:54.920> pry<00:00:55.920> in

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
black piece off of the main portion

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.780 
black piece off of the main portion
there<00:01:05.549> we<00:01:05.670> go<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.720> get<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.140> lid<00:01:07.409> off<00:01:07.790> and

there<00:01:22.329> we<00:01:22.450> go<00:01:22.869> so<00:01:23.700> just<00:01:24.700> pops<00:01:24.969> out<00:01:25.240> there's

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
there we go so just pops out there's

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:28.319 
there we go so just pops out there's
like<00:01:26.140> a<00:01:26.200> little<00:01:26.500> spring<00:01:27.039> in<00:01:27.250> here<00:01:27.490> so<00:01:28.119> when<00:01:28.240> you
