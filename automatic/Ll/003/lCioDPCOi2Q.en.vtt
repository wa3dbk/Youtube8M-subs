00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.290
 how about youtube friends can I give them 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:09.400
 I'm going to teach how to crack 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:13.420
 its done ampayers 2 and the only thing we're going 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.769
 to have to do is download what 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.640
 I'll leave you in the link in the description 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.110
 of the video 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.050
 Y 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.869
 obviously unzip it 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.860
 this is going to be what they are going to decompress 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.830
 that as you can see I already have here 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.570
 okay 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.570
 so they can see that if they have the same 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.929
 as you see here is 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:49.140
 to create stress they will not need 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.480
 a lot of fact the crack is already there is 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.610
 that we see there the only thing they would have 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.360
 to do you in case 3 as 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.980
 it is no longer open the folder that is here 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.750
 but simply enter the law stress 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.750
 let's copy it 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.280
 let's give copying 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.840
 and where you have installed the 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.720
 stress they will hit 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.890
 and at home there are microsoft games 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.890
 There is stress 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.780
 we see crystals three because she what 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.400
 wants but to see that in the 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.380
 games then 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.090
 but hit it I put it replace the file 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.770
 of destination 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.299
 and asks for administrator permissions 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.299
 let's give continue 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.700
 and ready 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:46.290
 that would be for stress 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.860
 now let's do it for the lecce 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.860
 two 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.360
 well we open the folder anyway 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.540
 here is unzipped ok so you can see 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.229
 that works anyway we're going to 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.229
 remove that 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.310
 at this time say that who is 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.659
 located there I do not know for what reason I 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.340
 say, but good 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.340
 you are going to execute this file 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.800
 they are going to give him here they notice that he is in 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.310
 this order 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.810
 with him saying this or two 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.300
 it's okay if the others do not appear 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.880
 folders do not worry they're just going to 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.880
 give ok and here they will give ok 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.040
 and as owner appears the crack that 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.420
 we also copy it again 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.150
 let's copy 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.780
 now we're going to local hard drive or 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.580
 where they have the fact 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.510
 microsoft 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.510
 of 62 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.130
 here we see that it is ready that we are going to 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.510
 do we are going to stick it 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.890
 let's see him replace 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.890
 let's allow it 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.599
 and that's just the way it is 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.510
 proceed to open the these probably 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.340
 for him 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.590
 program that I'm recording with 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.909
 lock leis 2 such a reason why 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.909
 probably pauses the video 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.870
 i 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.299
 [Music] 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.030
 well it's not over but it takes 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:40.450
 load 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.069
 let's go to a player we go to the 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.090
 bells 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:49.930
 let's choose the barbarroja we're going to 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:53.370
 better campaigns is for example 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.370
 let's apply whatever 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.680
 we skip that part so that they see that yes 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.599
 It can 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.640
 well I do not know why it became small I think 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:05.330
 which is because of a problem with the program 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:09.580
 with which I am recording 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.580
 but it is for them to see that if it works 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.360
 well I left 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.940
 that would be for ready 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:25.430
 In another case , stress is usually 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:30.050
 believe with would be the cereal 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:32.560
 serial already have the folder we are going to 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.560
 open it again 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:40.310
 from isoft and tolÃ³i and read mythologies 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.290
 they serve here we're serious 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:46.130
 this one says it 's for the titans 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:50.230
 also serves for mythological fact 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.230
 first for the first part 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:57.520
 that same one could be copied 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.680
 it is assumed that this file also serves 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.580
 I really did not use it because I did not 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.580
 do not need it 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:09.440
 but 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:13.180
 some other people and not say saw 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.180
 then we must examine 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:20.360
 I'll leave it on the desk I will 

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:24.820
 accept and install 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:28.510
 now we go to the desk 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:31.840
 and as we see here is already 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:34.980
 we will copy that file 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.980
 [Music] 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.550
 fernando in the cut for a second the 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.480
 video 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:45.340
 I had something to do we're going now a 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.740
 Once we copy him 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:50.110
 I think that in my case I already unzip it 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.060
 on the desk we are going to copy it from 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.460
 new 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:57.600
 and now we are going to do the same as 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.600
 we did with the other crack 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:03.760
 but in this case 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.449
 obviously we are going to stick it on the 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.639
 version of the myth reads it 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:10.150
 and what I am teaching you is for the 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:10.150
 the titans 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:15.400
 as you see here it is but there are good 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:17.249
 people who believe that I lie to them 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.630
 I play with you 

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:24.500
 we will give replace 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:28.780
 and there he is ready 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.780
 now that we are going to return the 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:36.060
 for him mythology that some people 

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:39.930
 They do not believe me too that you can play 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.930
 we go to the chin today and 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:44.720
 here they are going to serve this part of the 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:46.670
 original mythological 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:50.060
 the new cereal remember that the serial 

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:52.940
 You can use it on it 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.970
 can use the mythology of the 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:58.100
 expansion mythology to activate its 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:00.080
 1st mythology 

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:03.310
 obviously after decompressing the 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.310
 let's copy it 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:11.569
 in the microsoft games folder 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.569
 that was all 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:19.210
 and as we see here this weighs 6,516 good 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.830
 we're just going to hit him 

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.120
 we are going to replace the file of 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:25.020
 destination 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.020
 and ready 

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:30.069
 Well, maybe it took me a bit 

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.659
 but the truth is that most of 

00:07:30.069 --> 00:07:33.969
 you may be experts other 

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:37.210
 nothing other people really do not know 

00:07:33.969 --> 00:07:39.669
 a lot of this they do not understand 

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:41.710
 and that's why he explained them like this 

00:07:39.669 --> 00:07:44.350
 so that they understand so that 

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:46.780
 go learn 

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:50.850
 in my case I do not upload milk that I have 

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:50.850
 which are the complete collection because 

00:07:52.260 --> 00:08:00.140
 well the truth weighs almost 5 gigas and 

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.140
 for that very reason at the most 

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:04.110
 I do not have the internet of mouths for 

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.390
 upload it truth 

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:08.640
 and that would be all guys I hope that 

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:12.650
 serve you I hope that you 

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.650
 work and until next time
