welcome<00:00:01.260> to<00:00:01.439> our<00:00:01.470> tutorial<00:00:01.740> about<00:00:02.310> adding

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
welcome to our tutorial about adding

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.720 
welcome to our tutorial about adding
sketches<00:00:03.120> to<00:00:03.299> a<00:00:03.330> drawing<00:00:03.770> first<00:00:04.770> of<00:00:04.920> all<00:00:05.070> let's

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
sketches to a drawing first of all let's

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.310 
sketches to a drawing first of all let's
see<00:00:05.880> how<00:00:06.030> this<00:00:06.240> particular<00:00:06.660> part<00:00:07.140> was

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:07.320 
see how this particular part was

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.310 
see how this particular part was
constructed<00:00:07.980> as<00:00:08.719> you<00:00:09.719> see<00:00:09.929> we've<00:00:10.139> got

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
constructed as you see we've got

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.560 
constructed as you see we've got
construction<00:00:10.759> geometry<00:00:11.759> that<00:00:12.030> helps<00:00:12.419> to

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
construction geometry that helps to

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.160 
construction geometry that helps to
define<00:00:12.959> the<00:00:13.169> geometry<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:13.889> our<00:00:14.129> part

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
define the geometry of our part

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.790 
define the geometry of our part
now<00:00:16.170> let's<00:00:16.470> exit<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.040> sketch<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:18.650> let's<00:00:19.650> go

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
now let's exit the sketch and let's go

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.410 
now let's exit the sketch and let's go
to<00:00:19.860> new<00:00:20.070> drawing<00:00:20.370> make<00:00:20.610> drawing<00:00:20.940> from<00:00:21.150> part

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.980 

now<00:00:36.320> let's<00:00:36.590> go<00:00:36.740> to<00:00:36.800> the<00:00:37.040> sketch<00:00:37.310> tab<00:00:37.990> first

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:38.990 
now let's go to the sketch tab first

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.090 
now let's go to the sketch tab first
I'll<00:00:39.200> create<00:00:39.350> a<00:00:39.560> rectangle

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
I'll create a rectangle

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.540 
I'll create a rectangle

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.150 

let's<00:00:52.070> select<00:00:52.250> this<00:00:52.550> line<00:00:52.850> and<00:00:53.560> this<00:00:54.560> line<00:00:54.620> at

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
let's select this line and this line at

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.100 
let's select this line and this line at
a<00:00:55.510> collinear<00:00:56.510> relation<00:00:58.000> this<00:00:59.000> line<00:00:59.330> and<00:00:59.540> this

curve and this line create a tangent
relation<00:01:14.440> okay

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.910 

next<00:01:18.210> I'm<00:01:18.360> going<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.870> use<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.290> center<00:01:19.680> line

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
next I'm going to use the center line

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.220 
next I'm going to use the center line
tool<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.580> want<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.330> create<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.690> line<00:01:21.960> between

right click select I'm going to drop two
points<00:01:29.719> somewhere<00:01:30.229> here<00:01:30.640> let's<00:01:31.640> use<00:01:31.880> another

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
points somewhere here let's use another

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.000 
points somewhere here let's use another
centerline<00:01:32.869> now

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 
centerline now

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.880

I'm<00:01:35.070> going<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.000> touch<00:01:36.210> this<00:01:36.450> line<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.990> create

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
I'm going to touch this line and create

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.300 
I'm going to touch this line and create
a<00:01:37.920> line<00:01:38.220> from<00:01:38.550> the<00:01:38.700> center<00:01:39.120> of<00:01:39.150> this<00:01:39.450> line

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
a line from the center of this line

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.050 
a line from the center of this line
right<00:01:41.310> click<00:01:41.580> select

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
right click select

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
next let's go to the annotation tab hide

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.630 
next let's go to the annotation tab hide
show<00:01:46.479> annotations<00:01:47.260> I'm<00:01:47.500> going<00:01:48.220> to<00:01:48.340> select

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
show annotations I'm going to select

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.510 
show annotations I'm going to select
this<00:01:48.820> Center<00:01:49.299> mark<00:01:49.540> I'm<00:01:49.780> going<00:01:50.650> to<00:01:50.740> hide<00:01:50.920> it

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
this Center mark I'm going to hide it

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.389 
this Center mark I'm going to hide it
now<00:01:53.030> I'll<00:01:53.299> select<00:01:53.630> this<00:01:53.810> point<00:01:54.079> and<00:01:54.409> this

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
now I'll select this point and this

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.070 
now I'll select this point and this
curve

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
curve

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.560 
curve
I'll<00:01:57.680> add<00:01:58.220> a<00:01:58.250> concentric<00:01:58.820> relation

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
I'll add a concentric relation

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.750 
I'll add a concentric relation
so<00:02:01.500> like<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:01.920> line<00:02:02.220> and<00:02:03.080> this<00:02:04.080> point<00:02:04.410> and<00:02:04.760> add

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
so like this line and this point and add

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.580 
so like this line and this point and add
a<00:02:05.790> coincident<00:02:06.510> relation

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.200 

lastly<00:02:10.590> I'm<00:02:10.800> going<00:02:10.980> to<00:02:11.160> select<00:02:11.520> this<00:02:11.850> point

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
lastly I'm going to select this point

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.860 
lastly I'm going to select this point
and<00:02:12.480> this<00:02:13.320> curve

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
and this curve

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.830 
and this curve
as<00:02:14.930> well<00:02:15.709> as<00:02:15.860> this<00:02:16.040> line<00:02:16.310> I'll<00:02:16.610> create<00:02:17.599> an

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
as well as this line I'll create an

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.350 
as well as this line I'll create an
intersection<00:02:18.680> relation<00:02:20.110> let's<00:02:21.110> click<00:02:21.379> OK

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
intersection relation let's click OK

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.880 
intersection relation let's click OK
let's<00:02:23.360> add<00:02:23.540> one<00:02:23.569> more<00:02:23.810> construction<00:02:24.530> line

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
let's add one more construction line

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.430 
let's add one more construction line
here<00:02:25.129> center<00:02:25.580> line<00:02:25.870> this<00:02:26.870> one<00:02:27.110> will<00:02:27.349> be

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
and then we'll specify the overall width

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.980 
and then we'll specify the overall width
make<00:05:23.139> it<00:05:23.289> dimension<00:05:23.740> driven<00:05:24.039> okay<00:05:24.990> lastly

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
make it dimension driven okay lastly

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.510 
make it dimension driven okay lastly
I'll<00:05:26.199> put<00:05:26.410> a<00:05:26.440> radial<00:05:26.830> dimension<00:05:27.310> right<00:05:27.550> here

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
I'll put a radial dimension right here

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.540 
I'll put a radial dimension right here
you

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550
