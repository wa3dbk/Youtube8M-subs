00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
branches they're actually arced sheets

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.400

years<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.530> really<00:02:35.300> really<00:02:36.300> wanted<00:02:36.840> one

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
years and I really really wanted one

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.470 
years and I really really wanted one
would<00:02:37.700> be<00:02:37.850> as<00:02:37.970> friendly<00:02:38.450> as<00:02:38.630> her<00:02:38.870> mother's<00:02:39.290> but

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
would be as friendly as her mother's but

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.940 
would be as friendly as her mother's but
Scalia<00:02:41.480> was<00:02:41.630> kind<00:02:41.840> of<00:02:41.870> skittish<00:02:42.170> when<00:02:42.680> she<00:02:42.830> was

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
Scalia was kind of skittish when she was

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.490 
Scalia was kind of skittish when she was
young<00:02:43.130> and<00:02:43.160> so<00:02:43.520> I<00:02:43.880> felt<00:02:44.750> that<00:02:44.810> maybe<00:02:45.110> she<00:02:45.380> would

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
young and so I felt that maybe she would

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.490 
young and so I felt that maybe she would
never<00:02:45.590> really<00:02:45.860> be<00:02:45.980> friendly<00:02:46.580> and<00:02:47.110> as<00:02:48.110> she's

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
never really be friendly and as she's

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.730 
never really be friendly and as she's
gotten<00:02:48.860> older<00:02:49.040> I<00:02:49.610> worked<00:02:49.970> with<00:02:50.120> her<00:02:50.270> more<00:02:50.740> I've

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
gotten older I worked with her more I've

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.160 
gotten older I worked with her more I've
offered<00:02:51.920> her<00:02:52.190> treats<00:02:52.550> and<00:02:53.030> stuff<00:02:53.360> so<00:02:53.990> she's

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
offered her treats and stuff so she's

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.790 
offered her treats and stuff so she's
become<00:02:54.590> more<00:02:55.370> familiar<00:02:55.550> with<00:02:56.330> me<00:02:56.930> and<00:02:57.440> she

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
become more familiar with me and she

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.910 
become more familiar with me and she
actually<00:02:58.870> has<00:02:59.870> warmed<00:03:00.230> up<00:03:00.350> to<00:03:00.500> me<00:03:00.530> a<00:03:00.650> whole<00:03:00.830> lot

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
actually has warmed up to me a whole lot

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.030 
actually has warmed up to me a whole lot
and<00:03:01.450> now<00:03:02.450> she'll<00:03:02.810> actually<00:03:03.020> kind<00:03:03.590> of<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.800> cage

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
and now she'll actually kind of the cage

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.000 
and now she'll actually kind of the cage
by<00:03:04.400> herself<00:03:04.820> she'll<00:03:05.270> jump<00:03:05.540> on<00:03:05.720> me<00:03:05.930> and<00:03:06.260> climb

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
by herself she'll jump on me and climb

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.250 
by herself she'll jump on me and climb
on<00:03:07.250> me<00:03:08.080> she's<00:03:09.080> still<00:03:09.320> not<00:03:09.500> like<00:03:10.780> super<00:03:11.780> into<00:03:12.110> me

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
on me she's still not like super into me

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.600 
on me she's still not like super into me
she<00:03:12.650> doesn't<00:03:12.770> want<00:03:12.950> to<00:03:12.980> be<00:03:13.100> on<00:03:13.190> me<00:03:13.340> all<00:03:13.460> the

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
she doesn't want to be on me all the

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.340 
she doesn't want to be on me all the
time<00:03:13.790> but<00:03:14.150> it's<00:03:14.330> a<00:03:14.450> huge<00:03:14.690> improvement<00:03:14.870> from

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
time but it's a huge improvement from

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.160 
time but it's a huge improvement from
the<00:03:15.500> way<00:03:15.620> she<00:03:15.650> was<00:03:15.980> and<00:03:16.900> hopefully<00:03:17.900> she'll

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
the way she was and hopefully she'll

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.760 
the way she was and hopefully she'll
keep<00:03:18.410> warming<00:03:18.770> up<00:03:18.890> to<00:03:19.070> me<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:19.460> eventually<00:03:20.770> be

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
keep warming up to me and eventually be

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.070 
keep warming up to me and eventually be
as<00:03:21.890> friendly<00:03:22.280> as<00:03:22.400> I<00:03:22.640> had<00:03:23.510> hoped<00:03:23.660> that<00:03:23.840> she

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
as friendly as I had hoped that she

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.380 
as friendly as I had hoped that she
would<00:03:24.230> be<00:03:24.380> from<00:03:24.710> the<00:03:24.830> start<00:03:28.060> so<00:03:29.060> I'm<00:03:29.210> gonna

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
would be from the start so I'm gonna

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.330 
would be from the start so I'm gonna
move<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.930> camera<00:03:30.140> back<00:03:30.530> a<00:03:30.560> little<00:03:30.890> bit<00:03:31.040> and

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.330 
especially like to be touched under the
throat<00:04:12.150> that<00:04:12.870> seems<00:04:13.170> to<00:04:13.410> be<00:04:13.440> not<00:04:13.860> so

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
throat that seems to be not so

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:37.920 
throat that seems to be not so
intimidating<00:04:14.610> to<00:04:15.180> them<00:04:18.109> she's<00:04:19.109> really<00:04:19.350> cool

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
but their tails are really really cool

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.180 
but their tails are really really cool
because<00:04:51.250> they're<00:04:51.730> prehensile<00:04:52.360> and<00:04:53.050> so<00:04:53.440> I<00:04:53.830> like

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190

because they're prehensile and so I like
little<00:04:54.460> monkeys<00:04:55.080> and<00:04:56.080> they<00:04:56.170> jump<00:04:56.410> around<00:04:56.500> on

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
little monkeys and they jump around on

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.020 
little monkeys and they jump around on
the<00:04:56.800> branches<00:04:57.250> and<00:04:57.460> hold<00:04:57.610> on<00:04:57.760> with<00:04:57.910> their

the branches and hold on with their

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:04.950 
the branches and hold on with their
tails<00:05:02.160> when<00:05:03.160> she's<00:05:03.490> been<00:05:03.910> getting<00:05:04.120> a<00:05:04.390> diet<00:05:04.660> of

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
the boiled egg in writing so she gets

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.450 
the boiled egg in writing so she gets
that<00:05:11.710> occasionally<00:05:12.750> but<00:05:13.750> um<00:05:14.290> everything<00:05:15.130> I

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
that occasionally but um everything I

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.230

vitamin<00:05:19.240> and<00:05:19.360> calcium<00:05:19.420> powder<00:05:20.080> so<00:05:24.360> she<00:05:25.360> seems

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
vitamin and calcium powder so she seems

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:35.840 
vitamin and calcium powder so she seems
to<00:05:25.720> be<00:05:25.780> growing<00:05:25.960> really<00:05:26.290> well
