00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.420
 Hi everyone, alright, thanks for being 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.870
 watching this video and I hope you have 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.180
 I had a good time there, a good holiday too. 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:18.000
 and today I'll show you here with 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.400
 a story that shows that art does not 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.939
 has owner do not have 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.900
 Although our days are not living in 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:31.110
 times where there are love there are several 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.310
 ways of promoting some kind of 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.700
 I do not work 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.649
 through propaganda or obvious things 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.340
 this is mainly the work of 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.199
 art 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.780
 I'm going to show you one here today. 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.579
 work of art than in the first 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.670
 instant as that work 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.100
 appeared here and was considered a 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.679
 disaster is because she was a lady who 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.500
 was passionate about this portrait of 

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:59.309
 christ kiko a hyena a church in the 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.219
 spain and even so she was 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.329
 peeling and if this painting that 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.360
 world must know this story already 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.540
 here, and ended up doing a job of 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.370
 restoration on her own account here 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.900
 she had some artistic sense of 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:19.170
 artistic knowledge too right 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.240
 but still the first line in the 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.120
 first time like this, uh ua 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.440
 restoration of what she did in asking 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:30.990
 to nobody or without order from anyone 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.540
 turned this work into a 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.600
 It was not that weird. 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.330
 leaving it very different from what it was 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.540
 normal, she did one ended up making a 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.420
 re-reading this work and how 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.060
 probably she had not tried 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.190
 knowledge in brushstrokes in a 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.550
 pin tar right ee 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:57.360
 I ended up transforming what was a 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.770
 a realistic painting turned out to be the 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.980
 abstract ne 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.380
 and in the first abstract instant turned 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.330
 mock joke mock laughing motive 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.630
 all over the internet, right? 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.660
 and in the end the beginning he became a 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.400
 joke and she became a joke, right? 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.130
 she who did the restoration this woman would 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.010
 call Cecilia Gimenez and what she did 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.040
 was in the greatest good will and was not in the 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.600
 greater purity thus on the credibility 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.690
 that she was making a 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.290
 restoration work that will help 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.570
 let the best adventure and she was right in 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.370
 purity even so it was in the certainty of 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.720
 faith that she was doing something 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.200
 good 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.800
 at the time she became a joke around the world 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.780
 and that this restoration 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.660
 it turned out to be a medium in the world 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:54.180
 whole and everybody, everybody and everyone 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:56.640
 copied and and so by a work of grace 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.580
 god probably not so ended 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.390
 happening a miracle, yes, this work that 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.520
 she did 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.250
 and this painting she did so in the 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.170
 greater willingness but in the bad faith that 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.290
 she was doing a word-of-mouth thing 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.380
 simply saving the city and now 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.200
 is this church that our city of 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:20.070
 poznan that I think spain charges 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:23.310
 an entrance there to come to the painting and 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.739
 end is generating money yes and the year 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.709
 this news has gone 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:31.290
 days ago saying that since she did 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:35.760
 his work here in the city has already attracted more 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:38.070
 of 150 thousand visitors is not for borja and 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.769
 that in the end this was a miracle for the 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:43.560
 because it did not attract 1500 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:46.230
 before, nor was she suffering because in the 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:50.519
 Europe is in crisis and austerity 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:53.150
 fiscal or otherwise it is very difficult to 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:56.880
 if it survives in yas city points 1 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.250
 sinking and this capacity of borja by 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.549
 cause of Cecilia Gimenez here because of 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.920
 restoration she made to the 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:07.680
 contradicting 150,000 tourists in the 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.440
 City during the year and this generates 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:14.910
 money for hotel restaurants 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.360
 tourism and ends that brought the city to 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.910
 life back 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:22.310
 through a restoration that she did 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.370
 in the greatest goodwill that turned out to be 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.410
 joke and in the end this joke is over 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.840
 thus generating the salvation of this city 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.870
 then this restoration she made is that 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.120
 in the first instant thus the restoration 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.250
 which I always put she made in fashion the 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.900
 yes, yes, no more certainty 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.210
 do one thing right 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.160
 that first time she did it 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:47.480
 she became a joke, she became a 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:50.800
 disaster because for any restorer 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:54.590
 of paintings so classic, are not you? 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:57.290
 look at what was the frame that turned if it is 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:00.490
 one day ends up being a disaster but 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:03.910
 It turned out that this disaster turned out to be 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:08.120
 mythological and not become legendary because 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:11.240
 her restoration ended up attracting a lot 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:14.240
 more people than the original frame and right 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:17.990
 just that art has this but so 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:21.410
 in an appendix it maybe as soon as the 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:24.860
 We can not understand why this 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:28.460
 part of the art directly affects the 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:31.820
 spirit soul of the people there to the 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:34.010
 feelings these things and that many 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.080
 Sometimes we can not see 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:39.710
 this happens right? 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.780
 but we see that this happens and in this 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.710
 if you ended up saving a city here 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.310
 entire 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:50.419
 and this woman, too, has become a genius 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:53.630
 ne and art of mythological viro disaster 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:55.790
 Legend then this video was only 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:59.060
 to show you that art like this 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:02.330
 has no right so the conception of art not 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.760
 there is a owner there is this feeling 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:08.210
 that we put and this feeling 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:10.520
 not hit people or so that 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:13.970
 her case that has hit many people 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.290
 and eventually became myth would then that's it 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.210
 Thank you very much for having been 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.370
 served up here was just for us to know 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.750
 a little more about the art and see 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:25.750
 she does not have too much hard does not have much 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:28.150
 there is a lot of standardization in the yes to give 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.520
 sure that it works out because she has 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.110
 to go right and wrong because it has to 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.970
 go wrong on the island, that's it 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.380
 Happy New Year to you, guys here.
