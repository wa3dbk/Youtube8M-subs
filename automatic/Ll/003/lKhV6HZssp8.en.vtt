00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.530
 wire 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:17.680
 Malicious take a full weeks in any way 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:23.710
 I would advise you to not my main heroes I have the phone start 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:29.020
 Previously, Celtic 0 technology has changed a lot now, but before the season changes 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:30.039
 I did a good job. I did not like the original remote dealer. 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.850
 I did a lot 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:39.710
 This technology was also changing characteristics changed a lot so I chair 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.239
 Well this post is what it is now and I'll listen to it again. 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.719
 2 seconds 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:49.550
 The range of boomerangs mallet holding at No. 40 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:53.570
 Increase and Deceleration Duration 25% Increase That means you can make longer 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.370
 The people who have a long range will do a great job. 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.250
 Give 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.670
 S I bet that you create Hull 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:06.409
 His second is one of the very people. 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.210
 I'll take the characteristics of the hero in this powerful technology accumulated only 8% 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.600
 And basically increases. 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:17.119
 Each time you kill a hero, your skill history increases by 2%. 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:20.810
 I can stack stacked stacking up to 12%, so very word 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:25.310
 For a long time now to fight like when required 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:29.420
 I'll finish it because I can improve on all these skills, 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:33.170
 Skill-oriented characters are almost as powerful. 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.259
 I was like a team or a character like Nova. 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:41.420
 So at level 7, 2 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:44.450
 There are many boomerangs north and north. 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.000
 A large-scale victim was visiting and still is. 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.350
 And 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.110
 5 must think 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:57.760
 In effect, avoid the hammer around before you get back. 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.120
 I'd like to see you at the hammer. 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:06.330
 I bought it. 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:10.440
 I do not like to stay in this way so much. 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:13.760
 10 dead in Tokyo infighting braking'm better take anger 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:17.120
 Oh 13 level, 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:21.680
 Now that I've put together, at level 13 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:24.950
 Well, two things are better than a giant killer . This giant killer. 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:29.209
 Almost ripe siblings 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:32.390
 I'm taking some phone insurance abused the city where one in three gaejung but pyeongta 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:37.459
 What I would like to bear almost is the angle of love I have. 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:43.609
 If this happens, go to the game so focused almost saneunge I read the pyeongta 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:48.440
 Itguyo see that the opponent party peer can now shop now before I took 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:53.480
 This person's gong is now the most well rated place in the world you are 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.650
 I can tell you that it is quite good to take a picture 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.880
 Seems to 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.470
 Apollo 4 3 Good practice I have to practice but I am a little better 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.590
 I can not 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:08.150
 I've been to the next 100 though. 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:11.480
 I'm new to this one, but what would be better at level 1 16? 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:16.630
 Here too and output 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:19.640
 If you use a 40% increase of 5 to 25% and mana cost for all technical power 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:23.090
 Makin from attack mana according yo straight 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:27.970
 I'm going to have to do this at 10 o'clock. 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:32.000
 Let's talk about the Wild Hamel calling National 6 in descending order. 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:35.450
 Yeah I'm Never Die isnt 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.090
 If I hit you like this now, I'll give you 319. 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:42.110
 3 I can not do it. 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:45.140
 391 8 increased attack power. 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.470
 So how do you connect back 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:51.320
 It is written in Japanese as a holding q 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:55.520
 I look at the ball after I write a lightning rod 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:59.209
 This means that the handle is only running with little damage . 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:01.090
 And this was among the technical power of the technology accumulates more 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:05.379
 I'll do it 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:08.980
 I used to be a full 5-pack Carrick, but now I'm a little upper. 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:14.440
 Reversing is going to be nephewing like this . 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:20.290
 Still , he said that the windows are so powerful that they can put a deal 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:22.990
 Through this one night, I will have a very good chance of catching up with the ex-king. 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:28.540
 In front of A3 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:33.730
 And besides, I have almost no 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:39.850
 And I'm just here at level 13. 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:41.590
 Another lot of crossroads about 35% of the building to the giant hunter I inrang 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.190
 Take 30% chance 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:50.500
 25% of these projects are rarely taken. 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:55.270
 And it gave priority to three gaejung why I'm going to fit the situation 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:58.599
 I think this nation tree has its own way, 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:03.130
 Sipgin, yet some two 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:04.240
 Afostar says I do this personally as I do now 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:09.460
 It seems to be good 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:13.270
 So this way, you can use the PostScript tech tree in this way. 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:16.509
 This is how you can strengthen q and increase your technical power. 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:21.430
 Again, what is also the point at which hopping is dictated pyeongta 4 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:27.340
 And an output sub-pouring output with the output of Science ur 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:32.099
 It's a good idea to put a rabbit in it and you can win 2 poster wins 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.099
 4 I told you. 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:39.840
 I might have done this on the team this way . 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:44.250
 So there you go. 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:50.030
 Touching'll tell Joe that the book party Polestar framework far the technology I 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:50.030
 I'll show you more and more . 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:06:06.390
 You
