00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.550
 I had not talked 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.229
 exclusively football in the room 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.540
 press of the sports city of 

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:11.820
 white set and in the previous 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.490
 Classic Sunday itself that was 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.119
 our concern is to continue 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.100
 improving until we reach the level that 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.720
 has been a level that 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.990
 the season has made us champions 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.410
 last try to reach that level of 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.240
 try to stay as long as possible 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.470
 and playing this maximum says sometimes 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.530
 our concern I have decided for 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:41.400
 play with marcelo against ajax and I 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.100
 It seems that it was a good decision because 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.140
 has played 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.480
 very good match every game is a 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.480
 match and tomorrow is the truth 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:57.790
 and who will play low and high start 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.790
 for the classic last season 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:06.750
 from obliga of barcelona and that 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.750
 It was fine since it was maquila 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.150
 and I can not think for the head of the 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.520
 others 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.000
 and trainers under normal conditions 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.190
 I'm just going to know the opposing team 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.640
 one hour before the match 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.550
 I have to give my equipment before 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.350
 I can decide my team based on 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.570
 team to turn because I do not know who is going to 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.670
 play on the team on the team 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.960
 adversary for me who play all 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:40.390
 because matches like this 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.390
 and they are matches I say in a way 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.160
 metaphorical that are parties that stop the 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:52.230
 world that all those who play 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:55.500
 there are those who are well and in the case 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:58.510
 Then I'm glad that the thing is not 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.420
 it is as serious as 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.760
 as seemed another of the aspects that 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.620
 he wanted to make clear the 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.710
 Real Madrid coach were the following 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.960
 in the event that tomorrow 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.220
 lose the match 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.220
 how to get that league 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:20.010
 value that difference 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.690
 let me play a game first 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:27.080
 do not be so pessimistic 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.970
 optimistic jaime with the last bird 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.410
 tragic videos that have helped the 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.210
 barcelona fears that he would present it 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.860
 field is also a factor that can 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.010
 hurting to criticize the referee who 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.799
 see very depressed 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.680
 but things have happened since the beginning of 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:44.330
 the season 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.060
 but nobody in the trident program 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.630
 has anyone opened his mouth in the real 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.100
 Madrid 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:54.090
 one comment 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.890
 and I will not be where you want it and 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.860
 Real Madrid has substantially improved 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.300
 the last dates for this I think 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.980
 that is due to the players 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.370
 follow 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:10.210
 I understood that it was mandatory that 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:14.530
 mandatory to change the mandatory 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:16.710
 and be more motivated more focused 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.480
 more stuck 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.260
 I think it makes consumer study 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:25.830
 understand what 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.830
 in the direction in which the team was 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.830
 the end of the season could only be a 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.680
 end of season 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.840
 negative then 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.870
 they have changed the chip and they change the chip 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.329
 it's easier for us to have good things happen 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.790
 tomorrow's environment will be hostile 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.200
 but they have also been added 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.090
 political claims through 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.439
 you want to know if you think that 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.730
 may affect the game in some way 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:54.650
 itself to the players 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:58.400
 and they put me on my feet nothing said 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.480
 also just not yet finished the 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.500
 questions 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.120
 I wanted to know also that the fact that 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.489
 this time 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.049
 the environment does not focus on you if you 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.370
 It makes you feel more comfortable because 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:10.780
 normally that range of hostility 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:13.010
 when the last years for you 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.720
 Barcelona has focused a lot on you 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.720
 the last of the next two
