00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.800
 Greetings to the friends of the blog Beppe Grillo The synergic vegetable garden was conceived over the years 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.660
 80 by Emilia Hazelip on the studies of natural agriculture by Masanobu Fukuoka. Since his 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:26.660
 death, in 2003, there were two people who carried it forward and with time 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:34.020
 they created this group which then also became an association. 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:59.660
 The synergistic vegetable garden has 4 fundamental principles which are: 1) not to plow or trample the earth; 2) do not use 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.670
 no type of chemical or animal fertilizer; 3) do not use any type of pesticide 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:14.540
 or herbicide; 4) use at least 3 different families in our cultivation. 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:28.760
 In this garden there are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 types and there are not only plants, as you can see there 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.770
 they are also flowers, aromatics, there is a bit of everything. There are also those that 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.500
 many people call weeds, I call them wild herbs or friends. 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.850
 We need straw to cover the ground to prevent the rain from carrying away the earth, it is used to 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:59.840
 keep the humidity in hot weather, the straw decomposes creates humus. 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.050
 In this piece we see some leeks that are still those of last year and in some cases 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.770
 they are driving away, let's see the Catalonia that is always last year, let's see 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.690
 a cabbage that is driving back from the root of last year, because for us it is important 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.280
 leave the roots in the ground because they decompose and nourish the soil. Also 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.140
 we can put the cut grass up here so that we use decomposition 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:39.140
 natural to feed the soil. Here instead we see freshly planted seedlings of salad. 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.560
 This garden is not only edible plants but they are also flowers that we then need for 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.440
 to have bees and to have insects. 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.180
 The main difference between organic farming and the synergistic vegetable garden is that we 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.160
 we no longer use any chemical or animal products. We do not use herbicides 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:20.160
 nor pesticides, we try to work with nature and natural rhythms. 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:28.530
 It has been shown by research by Dr. Alan Smith in the 1970s that plowing kills for 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.100
 too much oxygenation all the bacteria and microbes that are in the soil and therefore the soil 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:41.530
 it needs to recreate these elements and it takes more time. In conventional agriculture 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.970
 chemical fertilizers are used. The space can vary from 50 meters to that 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.630
 whatever you want, depending on what you want to cultivate, however I recommend starting 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.840
 always from something small because this garden needs to be taken care of and needs 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.650
 to be observed and to experience, is not a common garden. 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:11.890
 It can cost a few hundred euros but it is only the initial costs: the pipe, the guardians, 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:18.500
 straw, seedlings. Then over time you can learn how to get the seedlings and the costs 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.510
 you can only derive from seeds and seedlings. Someone learns to make seeds and 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.690
 the seedlings alone. 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.330
 In the Senate they are trying to do something, but some laws do not know much about it 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:37.990
 and therefore to say that there are possibilities, at this moment I don't know them and I don't know them. 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:44.290
 It is possible that there is a job development but not immediately, we are too 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:52.300
 studying some methods to do, experimenting with field crops, but this has 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.120
 a becoming from here to a few years. 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.900
 There is a change because of this crisis 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:09.000
 that we are brought, people want to return to something healthier and more natural 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.910
 and he also wants to return to contact with nature and therefore, in my opinion, he is no longer one 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:22.190
 fashion but it is a need to return to living in health as Dr. Berrino himself says: 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.820
 let's go back to eating healthy foods and then let's grow them too! 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:34.840
 From the permaculture I learned that criticism is not constructive, so I always prefer 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:42.910
 take the best parts or try to listen to the other person and understand 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:49.370
 because a criticism "moves" me. Our intent now is to disclose as much as possible 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.950
 this method and also create relationships with people, therefore getting to know people e 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:58.750
 help them along a path of personal growth, even change sometimes! The 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:06.350
 feel inside, it's not something you ... come, work, taste the products and then you make yourself 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.200
 account of the difference! 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.600
 Spread the word!
