00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.319
 atmosphere 

00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:11.399
 the earth is surrounded by a layer of air called atmosphere 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:15.529
 imagine the earth as if it were an orange 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.390
 the atmosphere is like the skin around the orange 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.260
 the air is a mixture of gases mainly nitrogen and oxygen 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:29.239
 the atmosphere is what allows us to live on this planet 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.269
 the atmosphere is divided into several layers 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.170
 the troposphere is the layer in which we live 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.200
 It contains 90% of the air in the atmosphere 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.630
 it is here where the clouds that the winds moved over the 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.220
 Earth's surface 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.170
 to help prepare the weather forecasts are sent beyond 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.620
 the troposphere some balloons that carry instruments to measure the conditions 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.450
 atmospheric 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.450
 the data reaches the earth by radio 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.440
 as the interior of this layer extends, the air becomes thin and 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.640
 high in the mountains, I do not know that it's not enough to breathe with 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.640
 ease 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.970
 the layer that lies above the troposphere is called the stratosphere 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.460
 the air at this altitude is much more rarefied than the one below 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.729
 aircraft that cover long-haul routes fly in the part 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.930
 bottom of the stratosphere to take advantage of it decreasing the 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.100
 air resistance 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.520
 sometimes they are helped by high-speed jet streams 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.750
 among the various gases that exist in the stratosphere is a type of 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.140
 oxygen called background 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.360
 of ozone absorbs and a large part of harmful ultraviolet radiation 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.360
 coming from the sun 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.140
 above the stratosphere is the I will not be 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.300
 it is so called because it contains layers of electrically charged particles 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.299
 called scripts 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.790
 these layers are very important for the transmission of radio signals 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.479
 around the planet 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:17.799
 the transmitter of a station in day the radio waves upwards 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.859
 crossing the atmosphere and reflect two in ohio it will be 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.839
 to then return to the earth many kilometers away from where 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:28.089
 they left 

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:31.309
 the layer of the atmosphere furthest from the earth is called the exosphere 

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:35.979
 barely contains fat 

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:39.079
 the exosphere is the point where the Earth's atmosphere transforms into 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:41.979
 part of outer space 

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:45.399
 the meteorological satellites are in orbit around the earth within 

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:48.669
 society and facilitate most of the weather images we see 

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:50.299
 in the weather forecasts that appear on television
