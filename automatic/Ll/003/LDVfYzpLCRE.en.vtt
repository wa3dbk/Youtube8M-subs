00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620
 There are right and the President 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.430
 Study on 20 cases of Jeju Island Halla 5 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:19.770
 Research on the artificial breeding of the endangered species is often in progress. 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.560
 Frequently packed about 1 cm high 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.130
 In the past two years, research into this very small bug plant has been conducted 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.670
 That's it. 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:42.500
 Using the seeds obtained while coloring the slate 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.400
 Ebara is made into a test tube and is characterized by its small size in water 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.600
 That 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:51.800
 Creating a demand geusae so plants can grow well in them to give up control 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.930
 How do you grow with a super- sowing of a seed with a little inhibition? 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.980
 We are developing the course . 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.120
 Yes 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:05.629
 Often the ground machinery is stretched like a thread in the ground 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.629
 It's in the bottom of the earth mop up pockets of self-capsule supplement 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:17.520
 Now the success of the current disputes steps to ensure their own testing and proliferation at sight 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.520
 About 400 individuals are raised. 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.540
 U 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:29.909
 This is now part of the mouth of the stage is usually outside the food now 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.049
 I think this is the way 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.049
 There are two forms 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:42.829
 Still, the information is not enough. 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:42.829
 We will continue research for mass proliferation. 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.560
 College student Yunhan Seok, who climbs hard in the mountains 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:06.110
 He handed worms that live plants unleashed the worm fishing plants for more than 10 years eotaxin 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:11.510
 I know 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:14.180
 Now , as part of the restoration of native habitats, seeds are sprinkled on a sticky spatula 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:19.459
 I'm on my way. 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:25.910
 It looks like I'm in debt to Archer , and I'm in a cloudy place this spring. 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:30.050
 But in fact spur the wall'm not even last a few people in fur 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.470
 It's the same. So I need to check how many are left. 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.470
 same 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:43.040
 I'm hoping that the sticky spatula has grown a lot. 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:47.650
 I'll go over everywhere. 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.650
 Things are not as good as we expected 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:56.079
 The sticky spatulas found in wetlands are only a few books 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:13.150
 Ping can inadvertently look for the ignorant hikers that the wetlands around Yen 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:19.360
 It is quite easy to have one part of the picture because it is easy to work on foot. 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:24.310
 If you are a buyer who is a social I do not know what kind of power the first one kind of 2 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:30.000
 Trying to get the country as chungah itguyo huge resources and suji Sun 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.000
 So even though I'm passionate about where I live, 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:39.959
 Heart every time I see something that is damaging to health is not sprayed seeds 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:44.780
 The activity is getting harder, 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.780
 We can not stop the native restoration activity. 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.730
 U 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:04:01.500
 Among the native species of our country, there are wild insects enthralled by wild islands 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.500
 Because I know 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:15.940
 Living in the pine water, less than 4 to 5 cm in length under the leaves 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.940
 Only insect food eating underwater worms 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:34.729
 Yoon Hae-Seok tells the wild enthusiastic mop prey to study ecological characteristics 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.729
 I have a dream to restore one day. 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:43.889
 The worm- feeding horse is now the first to appear in the late Cretaceous 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.340
 It's in the plant. 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:52.280
 It 's extinct all over the world right now. 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:55.940
 Only as the only stand to revive the Good President primarily discharges If Japan 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.940
 I'm doing activities. 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:06.240
 Mopping plants with unique and colorful appearance 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:09.249
 And a small but precious native species 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:14.680
 Manager b Plant 

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:18.629
 Even in the face of carvers , which are visible right away , 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.629
 The value you have is very large. 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:25.599
 As the research is still not enough, the fascinating century of insect plants 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.919
 In the future 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:28.919
 It will be unlimited .
