00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
that is we're used to historically

the bigger the engine the better the

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
performance well the world has changed

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.670 
performance well the world has changed
now<00:00:38.850> it's<00:00:38.970> about<00:00:39.030> efficiency<00:00:39.780> it's<00:00:40.140> about<00:00:40.350> how

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
now it's about efficiency it's about how

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.380 
now it's about efficiency it's about how
we<00:00:40.739> can<00:00:40.890> get<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.130> most<00:00:41.460> out<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.030> smallest

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
we can get the most out of the smallest

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.240 
we can get the most out of the smallest
and<00:00:42.960> what<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.230> does<00:00:43.380> for<00:00:43.650> us<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:43.860> gives<00:00:44.100> us

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
and what that does for us this gives us

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.040 
and what that does for us this gives us
the<00:00:44.370> performance<00:00:44.730> but<00:00:45.300> also<00:00:45.480> gives<00:00:45.810> us<00:00:45.930> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
the performance but also gives us the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.870 
the performance but also gives us the
fuel<00:00:46.260> economy<00:00:46.440> at<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.770> same<00:00:46.980> time<00:00:47.220> so<00:00:47.730> this

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880 
fuel economy at the same time so this

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.360 
fuel economy at the same time so this

1.6 liter direct injection turbo engine

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.700 
1.6 liter direct injection turbo engine
has<00:00:51.649> 188<00:00:52.649> horsepower<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.420> 177<00:00:54.420> pounds<00:00:55.350> of

has 188 horsepower and 177 pounds of

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.560 
has 188 horsepower and 177 pounds of
torque<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.399> very<00:00:56.640> lightweight<00:00:56.910> weighs<00:00:57.450> about

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
torque the very lightweight weighs about

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.810 
torque the very lightweight weighs about
1,400<00:00:58.380> kilograms<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:59.370> what<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.550> really

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
1,400 kilograms so what that really

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.580 
1,400 kilograms so what that really
means<00:01:00.090> for<00:01:00.270> us<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.960> torque<00:01:01.290> or<00:01:01.559> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
means for us is the torque or the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.229 
means for us is the torque or the
twisting<00:01:02.190> energy<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.790> comes<00:01:02.969> out<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.120> the

the<00:02:09.640> beauty<00:02:09.970> of<00:02:10.000> this<00:02:10.179> system<00:02:10.420> is<00:02:10.750> it<00:02:11.470> does<00:02:11.680> so

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
the beauty of this system is it does so

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.160 
the beauty of this system is it does so
as<00:02:12.310> a<00:02:12.370> sense<00:02:12.610> of<00:02:12.730> slippage<00:02:13.120> it<00:02:13.600> will<00:02:13.720> go<00:02:13.810> up<00:02:13.959> to

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
as a sense of slippage it will go up to

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.130 
as a sense of slippage it will go up to
100%<00:02:14.620> front<00:02:15.130> up<00:02:15.310> to<00:02:15.340> 50/50<00:02:16.060> front<00:02:16.300> or<00:02:16.420> rear<00:02:16.570> but

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
another benefit of the vectoring is not

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.970 
another benefit of the vectoring is not

that<00:02:23.860> means<00:02:23.950> for<00:02:24.190> us<00:02:24.250> is<00:02:24.310> when<00:02:24.550> you're<00:02:24.640> driving

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
that means for us is when you're driving

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.430 
that means for us is when you're driving
down<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.090> road<00:02:25.360> and<00:02:25.600> you're<00:02:26.050> coming<00:02:26.320> into

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
down the road and you're coming into

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.020 
down the road and you're coming into
some<00:02:26.620> aggressive<00:02:26.920> turns<00:02:27.430> as<00:02:27.700> you're<00:02:27.850> driving

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
what the vectoring system does is it

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.820 
what the vectoring system does is it
measures<00:02:30.760> things<00:02:31.150> like<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:32.170> acceleration<00:02:32.739> of

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
acceleration of the vehicle and it

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.360 
acceleration of the vehicle and it
determines<00:02:38.140> based<00:02:38.410> on<00:02:38.680> how<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:38.920> vehicles

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
determines based on how the vehicles
