00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
only be about halfway full

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.789 
only be about halfway full
jug<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:08.100> they<00:01:08.280> can't<00:01:08.580> swim<00:01:08.939> out<00:01:09.150> because

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
jug and they can't swim out because

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.340 
jug and they can't swim out because
these<00:01:10.799> flaps<00:01:11.159> will<00:01:11.520> be<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.850> way

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
these flaps will be in the way

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.170 
these flaps will be in the way
in<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.590> can't<00:01:13.830> swim<00:01:14.070> out<00:01:14.189> because<00:01:14.640> this<00:01:14.909> part

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
in the can't swim out because this part

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.120 
in the can't swim out because this part
will<00:01:15.210> kind<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.750> be<00:01:15.900> out<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.350> water<00:01:16.500> this

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
will kind of be out of the water this

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.469 
will kind of be out of the water this
part<00:01:17.430> will<00:01:17.610> be<00:01:17.729> out<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.000> water<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.330> little

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
part will be out of the water a little

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.730 
part will be out of the water a little
bit<00:01:18.830> so<00:01:19.830> they<00:01:20.070> can<00:01:20.570> if<00:01:21.570> they<00:01:21.810> don't<00:01:22.530> really

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
bit so they can if they don't really

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.760 
bit so they can if they don't really
want<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.549> I'll<00:01:24.479> just<00:01:24.689> swim<00:01:25.020> over<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.500> and

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
want it so I'll just swim over it and

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.429 
want it so I'll just swim over it and
probably<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.850> they'll<00:01:27.000> go<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.360> there<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:28.350> you

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
probably and they'll go in there so you

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.050 
probably and they'll go in there so you
just<00:01:28.770> put<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> little<00:01:29.070> bit<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.490> water<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:29.880> here

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
just put a little bit of water in here

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.190 
just put a little bit of water in here
some<00:01:30.689> lunch<00:01:31.619> meat<00:01:31.920> or<00:01:32.189> some<00:01:32.810> right<00:01:33.810> in<00:01:33.840> there

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
some lunch meat or some right in there

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.580 
some lunch meat or some right in there
and<00:01:34.439> then<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:35.250> can<00:01:35.369> actually<00:01:35.700> catch<00:01:36.590> bluegill

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
and then you can actually catch bluegill

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.749 
and then you can actually catch bluegill
perch<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.970> use<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:40.020> for<00:01:40.170> minnows<00:01:40.409> though<00:01:42.320> yeah

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
perch I use it for minnows though yeah

use it while making up the I'll make
another<00:01:54.420> video<00:01:54.750> on<00:01:54.810> how<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.020> use<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.409> I'll<00:01:55.950> go

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
another video on how to use it I'll go

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.060 
another video on how to use it I'll go
to<00:01:56.219> our<00:01:56.430> pond<00:01:57.049> and<00:01:58.049> then<00:01:58.200> I'll<00:01:58.350> show<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.590> how
