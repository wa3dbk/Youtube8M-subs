00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.719
 some good guys we came back with 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.280
 play forfeit in this episode 2 me 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.320
 I'm going to not know me or 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.660
 for those who had not recognized me and 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.189
 we leave immediately like you do a 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.500
 purchase immediately and paloschi 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:27.390
 as it was recommended by me or fuck 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.429
 Look owe him a favor, do not say 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.859
 because we will see during the episode but 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.690
 this is only paloschi because I wanted to 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.660
 replace whites that changed me 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.340
 to be really scarce and I have nothing 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.160
 only understood what the first opponent is 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.290
 a premier league 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.629
 nothing that I see rafa that is not me 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.739
 seemed bad in the game 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.370
 the others are players anyway 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.110
 normal not rare and inexpensive 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.820
 let's go to the ninth minute paloschi involato 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.520
 towards the door sissoko decides to 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.489
 kill him from behind with a foul e 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.649
 the referee obviously to the skins and how 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.850
 you have seen the foul but in my opinion it is 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.810
 inside the area 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.640
 the referee gave position from the limit e 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.229
 its position has resulted in this 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.299
 corner kick that led to the goal 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.610
 of one to zero of goshawks 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.560
 story happens among other things if you look at i 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.659
 shorts this shirt is from 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.420
 this kit is fantastic because it is there 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.509
 a small house 3 0 reaches 32nd 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.439
 after several minutes marks only 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.150
 gabbiadini really a player 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:32.400
 phenomenal for what it costs 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:35.540
 really very strong the 3 to 0 arrives in the 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.939
 minutes of recovery of the first time with 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.799
 our friend there the outside is not me 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.420
 I remember who it was maybe hand and am 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.770
 clearly in the middle and paloschi does 3 to 0 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.720
 40 in the second half with paloschi that 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.610
 first take a parade on the ass and 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.040
 then receives 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.650
 the partner's cue and in front of the 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.900
 goalkeeper is not wrong 40 here with continues 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.930
 avalanche of goals still paloschi launched 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.590
 then he does something against the goalkeeper 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.870
 phenomenon is a beautiful lob that 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.790
 bypasses the extreme defender so not 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.259
 I know how many did maybe three 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.110
 so a great purchase 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.600
 in short, a crazy player 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.150
 paloschi 9 is a very good player I have to 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.020
 say and here goes to you that golasso that that 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.550
 he invents himself with the left-handed to the seventy-first 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.860
 really phenomenal 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.510
 I thank the boy he had 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.660
 recommended this is the novelty 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.160
 main from this episode 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.790
 we will buy the players that there 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.440
 advisor you and we will quote you the short 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.190
 video here also marked plans there 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.590
 we are 7 to 0 in the ninetieth 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.510
 or rather it was not we say that yes 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.070
 entered he enters his defense from 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.959
 every part I've been a while too 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.850
 bastard at the end continuing to score 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.370
 and then as you will see in the episode episode 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.799
 maybe repulsive karma also marks 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.450
 kovacic at the end for the 9 to 0 if not 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.299
 final mistake 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.670
 paloschi poker that really has me 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.810
 surprised a good buy but a purchase 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.010
 for what it really costs 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.130
 player 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.060
 nine points obviously after the 6 that has 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.830
 made mic 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.680
 as you can see I'm going to make other purchases 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.630
 Sorry purchases the first of which is 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.330
 to the letter that you are advised by 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.090
 gamers shake sun I read badly 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.580
 always of course 350 every purchase e 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.799
 then behrami in midfield anyway 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.180
 always because everyone was a little tired 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.850
 the others 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.590
 here i buy behrami then i took also 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.110
 nagatomo because he was tired for hera e 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.420
 then unfortunately I finished finished 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.730
 all credits and therefore others 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.590
 tired that they were just kovacic and i 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.230
 Defenders I could not change them 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.030
 second team this team 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.130
 Brazilian with five defenders 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.350
 you will see that it creates me several several 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.120
 problems especially to unhinge her mimÃ¬ 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.400
 it is difficult indeed first goal comes to 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.890
 how much we should like you nagatomo yes 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.750
 lance nagatomo rushes towards the area 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.569
 opponent and with the right rediscovered 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.040
 be right unaga tome type 30 seconds 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.280
 before this goal 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:08.099
 but he said mic we were calling and 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.680
 so 10 and how much there was a 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:13.530
 crazy defensive and key mess 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.799
 re marks him too at the onset we say 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.019
 it didn't particularly impress me 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:20.820
 but now we'll see we'll see during the 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.630
 video what will happen then is a player 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.229
 normal 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:29.100
 here he marks the 3 to 0 an error 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:32.370
 of the por quÃ© jefferson that returns badly in 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.669
 this paloschi ago ago ago from side and e 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.070
 arrives at the door 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:42.570
 Mariano is reinvented to the sixtieth 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:45.289
 maicon jonathan if you prefer and shoot 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.039
 nuestra stamina that goes to thread 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:50.160
 all'angolino 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:52.080
 so 3 to 1 and to scare me here 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.940
 confesses this action that obviously 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.470
 frog closes cleanly but 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.199
 not according to the referee 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:01.560
 enough of keane pv that I am going to expel 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:04.050
 frog then penalty kick with a 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.590
 man down a bit short, there is a bit of 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:11.099
 suffer like you, about 6 minutes left 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:15.449
 we have inner marks renato renato 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:17.699
 augusto maybe it's 3 to 2 but really 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:20.639
 the next action crosses in and 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:24.180
 paloschi always marks him marks another 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:26.070
 goal then to 86th we say reclosing 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.169
 to match 4 to 2 then move a couple of 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.000
 behrami players his defenders e 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:31.440
 in short, everyone covers me a little bit 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.020
 for the last seconds previte them 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:37.070
 take goals and finish this game a 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.539
 suffering as you win the title 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.400
 first title obviously had with the 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:43.949
 division 10 2000 credits that are not 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.050
 few and I go to buy some more 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:48.270
 gambler first of which prawns for 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:51.030
 the defense because as surely 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.940
 imagine they were all a little tired 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.830
 buy to buy 500 got up a 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.270
 but a little price is not a price 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.289
 excessive for a player that anyway 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.280
 it has an excellent speed 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:04.680
 good defense good header 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.630
 so perfect great defense so little 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.600
 rib then buy roncaglia that I have it 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.460
 tried my account in my team 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.070
 and it's really a great player then 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.960
 I buy a contract because we say for 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.790
 sentimental reasons for gabbiadini not 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.370
 I wanted to sell it buy it again to lose 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.530
 statistics and then against mauro icardi 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.980
 as a substitute for chiefs of 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:27.840
 that he was tired anyway as a third striker 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.810
 the last purchase I make I believe 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.940
 the last Mauritian isla 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:35.520
 yes I think it's the last to play there 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.770
 third game because if b a reserve of 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:41.280
 enough that it was a little tired the 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:43.500
 third opponent is a series like the 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:47.070
 my more or less maybe a little less or 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:50.580
 less strong with ambrose darmian 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:52.970
 to the other like as fullbacks like you 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.140
 mertens niang and other people are 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:58.140
 they are the most interesting 

00:06:55.140 --> 00:07:02.400
 and first goal arrives at the 38th with 

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:03.870
 emanuelson you have a great player later 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.880
 on the developments of this corner kick 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.320
 was the fifth kind of football 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.010
 I 'm not not in a corner corner 

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:13.440
 really exaggerating fourth fifth e 

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:15.210
 I came out to finally score, however 

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.010
 things didn't go so well 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:19.920
 obviously he and takes advantage of the classic 

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:22.080
 passage to the center, however, how to blame him 

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:25.380
 I am very strong where to mark with 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:29.040
 or they all do a little so there isn't 

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:30.690
 a lot to say marks mertens also because 

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:34.350
 the nations did not have much to do 

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:36.150
 and then we say that it gets even worse 

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:38.790
 game because at 45 you look cross 

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:41.160
 inside you do n't even throw yourself on the ball and 

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:43.970
 marks the goal that will be the definitive one 

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:46.290
 of victory 2 to 1 second time 

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:48.660
 we say very balanced game though 

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:51.600
 I failed to equalize and 

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:53.550
 obviously neither to win any boys 

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.710
 needs end here i hope you 

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:57.570
 whether you like it let so many like it for 

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:59.880
 let us see that you like it anyway 

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.800
 this series again 

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.750
 so this division starts badly 9 

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.650
 however surely mix ups will know how to do 

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.570
 better 

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:08.220
 I leave you the final question and we will 

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:10.430
 we are with a next video hi a 

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.430
 all
