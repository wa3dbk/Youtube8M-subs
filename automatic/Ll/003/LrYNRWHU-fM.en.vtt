one has ever complained about the audio
quality<00:00:30.320> but<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.349> started<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.830> wonder<00:00:32.070> when<00:00:32.579> it

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
quality but I started to wonder when it

quality but I started to wonder when it
comes<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:33.000> microphones<00:00:33.570> what<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.320> the

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
comes to microphones what is the

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.590 
comes to microphones what is the
difference<00:00:34.920> between<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.399> hundred<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.149> seventy

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
dollars and seven hundred dollars I just

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.510 
dollars and seven hundred dollars I just
picked<00:00:40.559> up<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.980> rode<00:00:41.780> ntg3<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.649> I'm<00:00:44.129> curious

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
picked up the rode ntg3 and I'm curious

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.270 
picked up the rode ntg3 and I'm curious
is<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.300> really<00:00:45.809> worth<00:00:45.960> spending<00:00:46.170> four<00:00:46.950> times

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
is it really worth spending four times

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.420 
is it really worth spending four times
as<00:00:47.489> much<00:00:47.640> for<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:48.059> microphone<00:00:48.890> out<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.219> box

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
as much for a microphone out of the box

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.490 
as much for a microphone out of the box
these<00:00:50.879> two<00:00:51.149> microphones<00:00:51.690> are<00:00:51.899> similar<00:00:52.379> in

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
these two microphones are similar in

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.830 
these two microphones are similar in
design<00:00:52.680> each<00:00:53.309> has<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.670> diaphragm<00:00:54.390> at<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.690> end

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
design each has a diaphragm at the end

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.709 
design each has a diaphragm at the end
of<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.230> long<00:00:55.469> slotted<00:00:56.250> tube<00:00:56.520> what<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.480> means

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
of a long slotted tube what this means

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.650 
of a long slotted tube what this means
is<00:00:57.989> sound<00:00:58.260> waves<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.829> enter<00:00:59.160> from<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.520> front

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
is sound waves that enter from the front

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.270 
is sound waves that enter from the front
travel<00:01:00.660> down<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.020> tube<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.530> are<00:01:01.920> picked<00:01:02.160> up

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
travel down the tube and are picked up

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.490 
travel down the tube and are picked up
by<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.489> diaphragm<00:01:02.820> but<00:01:03.719> sound<00:01:04.019> waves<00:01:04.290> that

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
by the diaphragm but sound waves that

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.679 
by the diaphragm but sound waves that
enter<00:01:04.799> from<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.159> side<00:01:05.430> might<00:01:06.060> bounce<00:01:06.390> around

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
enter from the side might bounce around

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.870 
enter from the side might bounce around
a<00:01:06.990> couple<00:01:07.170> times<00:01:07.290> before<00:01:07.979> being<00:01:08.189> rejected<00:01:08.670> by

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
a couple times before being rejected by

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.359 
a couple times before being rejected by
one<00:01:09.240> with<00:01:09.420> slots<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.799> how<00:01:10.920> shotgun

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
one with slots this is how shotgun

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.310 
one with slots this is how shotgun
microphones<00:01:11.820> are<00:01:12.060> able<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.330> focus<00:01:12.810> on<00:01:13.020> sound

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
microphones are able to focus on sound

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.820 
microphones are able to focus on sound
from<00:01:13.740> one<00:01:13.950> direction<00:01:14.869> the<00:01:15.869> rode<00:01:16.110> mic<00:01:16.140> feels

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
from one direction the rode mic feels

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.789 
from one direction the rode mic feels
solid<00:01:17.280> it's<00:01:17.759> 20%<00:01:18.299> shorter<00:01:19.080> than<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.380> as<00:01:19.500> down

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
solid it's 20% shorter than the as down

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.399 
solid it's 20% shorter than the as down
and<00:01:20.009> slightly<00:01:20.460> slimmer<00:01:20.970> yet<00:01:21.630> it's<00:01:21.810> nearly<00:01:22.170> an

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
and slightly slimmer yet it's nearly an

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.980 
and slightly slimmer yet it's nearly an
ounce<00:01:22.619> heavier<00:01:23.220> even<00:01:24.119> after<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.390> pop<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.869> the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
ounce heavier even after I pop in the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.140 
ounce heavier even after I pop in the
triple<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.380> battery<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.040> as<00:01:26.159> Den<00:01:26.520> weighs<00:01:26.790> less

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
triple a battery the as Den weighs less

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.690 
triple a battery the as Den weighs less
so<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.290> as<00:01:28.409> dent<00:01:28.680> has<00:01:28.829> its<00:01:28.979> own<00:01:29.159> power<00:01:29.430> supply

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
so the as dent has its own power supply

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.060 
so the as dent has its own power supply
and<00:01:30.150> on/off<00:01:30.540> switch<00:01:30.900> but<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.470> road<00:01:31.680> doesn't

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
and on/off switch but the road doesn't

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.130 
and on/off switch but the road doesn't
that<00:01:32.670> means<00:01:32.850> you'll<00:01:33.030> always<00:01:33.270> need<00:01:33.570> phantom

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
that means you'll always need phantom

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.289 
that means you'll always need phantom
power<00:01:34.350> for<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.770> road<00:01:34.950> which<00:01:35.460> I'll<00:01:35.759> explain<00:01:36.119> in

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
power for the road which I'll explain in

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.810 
power for the road which I'll explain in
a<00:01:36.390> few<00:01:36.570> minutes<00:01:36.840> each<00:01:37.829> mic<00:01:38.220> comes<00:01:38.610> with<00:01:38.790> a

as den comes with a shock mount so for
today's<00:01:43.829> testing<00:01:44.340> I've<00:01:44.490> borrowed<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:45.000> second

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
as den shock mount which is a little bit

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.139 
as den shock mount which is a little bit
too<00:01:48.090> long<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.810> fit<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.200> road<00:01:49.380> properly<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:50.189> love

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
too long to fit the road properly I love

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.940 
too long to fit the road properly I love
the<00:01:51.299> fact<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.869> rode<00:01:52.079> mic<00:01:52.110> comes<00:01:52.619> with<00:01:52.860> an

the fact that the rode mic comes with an

completely happy with my as denne
microphone<00:02:39.570> but<00:02:39.959> now<00:02:40.350> that<00:02:40.739> I'm<00:02:40.890> testing<00:02:41.340> them

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
microphone but now that I'm testing them

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.390 
microphone but now that I'm testing them
side<00:02:41.730> by<00:02:41.760> side<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.600> really<00:02:43.200> does<00:02:43.410> sound<00:02:43.650> tinny

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
side by side it really does sound tinny

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.690 
side by side it really does sound tinny
muffled<00:02:45.410> compared<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.860> rode<00:02:47.130> mic<00:02:47.160> and

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
muffled compared to the rode mic and

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.880 
muffled compared to the rode mic and
that's<00:02:48.239> because<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.720> road<00:02:48.959> has<00:02:49.320> a<00:02:49.350> greater

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
that's because the road has a greater

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.820 
that's because the road has a greater
dynamic<00:02:50.310> range<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:51.540> has<00:02:51.930> more<00:02:52.230> frequencies

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
dynamic range it has more frequencies

00:02:52.830 --> 00:03:01.100 
dynamic range it has more frequencies
higher<00:02:53.130> highs<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:53.910> lower<00:02:54.239> lows<00:02:59.690> the<00:03:00.690> only

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
higher highs and lower lows the only

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.870 
higher highs and lower lows the only
downside<00:03:01.590> I've<00:03:01.769> discovered<00:03:02.100> of<00:03:02.340> this<00:03:02.519> is<00:03:02.730> that

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
downside I've discovered of this is that

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.229 
downside I've discovered of this is that
I<00:03:02.910> hear<00:03:03.390> more<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:03.870> my<00:03:04.350> vocal<00:03:05.090> imperfections<00:03:06.090> I

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
I hear more of my vocal imperfections I

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.380 
I hear more of my vocal imperfections I
can<00:03:06.360> more<00:03:06.480> clearly<00:03:06.810> hear<00:03:07.350> my<00:03:07.530> breathing<00:03:07.860> and

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
can more clearly hear my breathing and

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.250 
can more clearly hear my breathing and
clicks<00:03:09.390> in<00:03:09.720> my<00:03:09.870> mouth<00:03:11.600> but<00:03:12.600> if<00:03:12.900> I<00:03:13.019> want<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.200> get

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
clicks in my mouth but if I want to get

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.990 
clicks in my mouth but if I want to get
rid<00:03:13.410> of<00:03:13.440> these<00:03:13.560> I<00:03:13.620> can<00:03:14.010> just<00:03:14.220> use<00:03:14.400> an<00:03:14.550> equalizer

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
rid of these I can just use an equalizer

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.390 
rid of these I can just use an equalizer
and<00:03:15.360> eliminate<00:03:16.230> those<00:03:16.410> frequencies<00:03:16.980> all

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
and eliminate those frequencies all

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.470 
and eliminate those frequencies all

better than the other so I'm going to

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.520 
better than the other so I'm going to
turn<00:03:37.230> on<00:03:37.290> this<00:03:38.040> heater<00:03:38.959> it's<00:03:39.959> on<00:03:40.049> high<00:03:40.290> right

see if either of them is doing a better

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.000 
see if either of them is doing a better
job<00:03:51.740> than<00:03:51.950> the<00:03:52.100> other<00:03:52.280> of<00:03:53.080> picking<00:03:54.080> up<00:03:54.200> just<00:03:54.800> my

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
job than the other of picking up just my

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.970 
job than the other of picking up just my
voice<00:03:55.220> and<00:03:55.610> not<00:03:55.760> that<00:03:56.150> heater<00:03:56.450> next<00:03:56.840> to<00:03:56.930> me<00:03:57.050> all

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
voice and not that heater next to me all

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.290 
voice and not that heater next to me all
right<00:03:58.070> so<00:03:58.250> right<00:03:58.430> now<00:03:58.580> both<00:03:58.760> my<00:03:58.910> microphones
