in<00:00:35.120> mobile<00:00:35.269> ploughing<00:00:35.870> my<00:00:36.019> point<00:00:36.410> is<00:00:36.620> that

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
in mobile ploughing my point is that

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:38.560 
in mobile ploughing my point is that
there's<00:00:37.010> a<00:00:37.070> lot<00:00:37.219> of<00:00:37.250> mould<00:00:37.550> boards<00:00:37.940> out<00:00:38.120> there

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
there's a lot of mould boards out there

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.770 
there's a lot of mould boards out there
that<00:00:39.019> have<00:00:39.530> paid<00:00:40.280> their<00:00:40.610> debt<00:00:40.879> they<00:00:41.420> are<00:00:41.449> not

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
that have paid their debt they are not

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.660 
that have paid their debt they are not
capable<00:00:42.050> of<00:00:42.440> doing<00:00:42.620> the<00:00:42.829> type<00:00:43.040> of<00:00:43.070> tillage<00:00:43.489> we

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
capable of doing the type of tillage we

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.360 
capable of doing the type of tillage we
need<00:00:43.879> now<00:00:44.120> some<00:00:44.780> of<00:00:44.809> them<00:00:44.960> are<00:00:45.170> sold<00:00:45.890> and<00:00:46.250> so

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
need now some of them are sold and so

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.100 
need now some of them are sold and so
bad<00:00:46.579> they'd<00:00:46.850> be<00:00:46.909> better<00:00:47.180> if<00:00:47.449> they<00:00:47.600> were<00:00:47.629> melted

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
bad they'd be better if they were melted

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.380 
bad they'd be better if they were melted
down<00:00:48.260> and<00:00:48.320> and<00:00:48.739> then<00:00:49.370> you<00:00:49.790> know<00:00:49.820> turned<00:00:50.180> into

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
down and and then you know turned into

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.750 
down and and then you know turned into
swords<00:00:50.720> they'd<00:00:51.019> be<00:00:51.140> doing<00:00:51.350> less<00:00:51.620> damage

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
swords they'd be doing less damage

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.039 
swords they'd be doing less damage
typically<00:00:52.760> some<00:00:52.940> of<00:00:52.969> those<00:00:53.089> older<00:00:53.390> plows<00:00:53.629> are

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:54.049 
typically some of those older plows are

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:56.020 
typically some of those older plows are
plowing<00:00:54.470> way<00:00:54.890> too<00:00:54.949> deep<00:00:55.369> the<00:00:55.850> plows

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
plowing way too deep the plows

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.119 
plowing way too deep the plows
demonstrate<00:00:56.629> here<00:00:56.869> today<00:00:57.140> they<00:00:57.680> can<00:00:57.830> plow

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
demonstrate here today they can plow

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.280 
demonstrate here today they can plow
quick<00:00:58.759> they<00:00:58.970> can<00:00:59.000> plow<00:00:59.239> shallow<00:00:59.600> they're<00:01:00.140> not

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
quick they can plow shallow they're not

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.990 
quick they can plow shallow they're not
plowing<00:01:00.559> pretty<00:01:01.009> like<00:01:01.250> to<00:01:01.400> do<00:01:01.519> it<00:01:01.640> at<00:01:01.970> a

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
plowing pretty like to do it at a

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.079 
plowing pretty like to do it at a
playing<00:01:02.659> match<00:01:02.869> but<00:01:03.530> they<00:01:04.009> will<00:01:04.339> plow<00:01:04.670> the<00:01:04.729> way

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
playing match but they will plow the way

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.420 
playing match but they will plow the way
the<00:01:05.239> farmers<00:01:05.630> want<00:01:05.869> and<00:01:06.170> of<00:01:06.439> the<00:01:06.890> various

the farmers want and of the various
plows<00:01:07.970> here<00:01:08.299> today<00:01:08.540> the<00:01:08.780> numerous<00:01:09.110> options

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
plows here today the numerous options

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.370 
plows here today the numerous options
are<00:01:09.799> just<00:01:10.100> limitless<00:01:10.640> so<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:11.570> farmer<00:01:11.990> or<00:01:12.170> the

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
are just limitless so the farmer or the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.710 
are just limitless so the farmer or the

want to be able to plant the problem

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.859 
want to be able to plant the problem
with<00:01:52.340> some<00:01:52.490> of<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:52.670> older<00:01:52.970> plows<00:01:53.180> was<00:01:53.600> that

can rent it and some of this newer
technology<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:48.060> is<00:02:48.090> expensive<00:02:48.840> but<00:02:48.959> there's

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
technology it is expensive but there's

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
technology it is expensive but there's

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
nothing wrong with renting a plow again
