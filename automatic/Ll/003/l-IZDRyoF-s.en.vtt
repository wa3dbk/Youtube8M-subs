00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500
 This piece is a mobile tripod 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:10.170
 says that if you know these situations in 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.700
 those who go with friends out there say 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.170
 when would like to see the all go out 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.660
 but someone has to do the photo 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.600
 I'm alone and I want to make a 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.199
 body picture internally a self and 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.199
 with this landscape 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.500
 the invention runs rooftops I have not put 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.770
 name but I've already consoled myself and it's my turn 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:33.850
 the is a rectangle eight centimeters 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.410
 for four or five leave in the boxes in 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.260
 the description box also a link 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.360
 to my blog with mails where I'll leave you a 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.590
 little the explanation of how to cut and 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.540
 these things and the measures the measures and 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.670
 a template in case you want to take it 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.400
 print it but already a guy that in this 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.989
 useless case that would make a 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.540
 rectangle and inside the rectangle 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.239
 leaving considerable margins for 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.700
 that the structure does not weaken 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.670
 another the smallest rectangle of 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:07.090
 tree more or less that which has as a 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.030
 little finger on each side and width wide 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.920
 of your mobile this width has to 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.710
 be the width in the mobile if it can be a 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.880
 little bit even better this by 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.590
 example is a little bit more I'm going to 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.229
 repeat a little less better match 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.140
 case king will be fit to force a little bit no 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.540
 too much is corrugated cardboard that does not 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.370
 I said is corrugated cardboard this one 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:31.000
 although it has inside like a cartonboard 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:33.370
 very fine in the form of wave I for example 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.460
 approached a box of a tobacconist's one 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:39.160
 tobacco shop where he brings tobacco 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.590
 all ways in any container of 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.420
 cardboard recycling or in any I do not know 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.150
 is any living room to see 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.850
 hotels and things like this is usually this 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.520
 good cardboard well if you do a tad 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.250
 nothing a few more millimeters closer 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.410
 that the width of the mobile will be even 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.450
 better because the mobile will hook better 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.550
 here it stays very wide and it 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.740
 will plant a little but if it is a little more 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.270
 narrow would get hooked and it would be a lot 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.420
 more stable doing the same 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.209
 stature is already also if your mobile 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.220
 It's very wide because I know you have a 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.920
 mobile troglodyte with camera and you want 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.380
 take pictures and you will have to enlarge 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.390
 You can also do this more 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.250
 less professional professional you can 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.920
 take this cardboard and leave it like this naked 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.110
 I like to leave the cardboard naked 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.660
 I like the color I like the texture but 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.250
 You can paint it to 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.320
 plasticize it to make it more 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.510
 resistant and lasts longer 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.580
 you can cut it perfectly the turn and 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.940
 make drawings of the kitty or what 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.580
 you want and that's it and it's very simple 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.740
 It serves both to put the phone in 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.290
 horizontal as in vertical holds in 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.780
 vertical and the good thing about it is like to 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.170
 be so finite by not needing to be a 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.750
 super device and he gets the rectum and is 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.430
 flat you can take the and put it in the 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.950
 portfolio for example you put in the 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.810
 portfolio and what versiona portfolio and in 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.910
 any time you have your tripod 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.190
 for the mobile is very simple and good 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.470
 that 's all now I leave you with a video 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.510
 demonstration of how it is used though 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.610
 I think you have understood and nothing 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.160
 I hope you're liking the channel and 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.660
 you know give me I like to share this 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.239
 video with all the people that you 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:23.569
 may interest this in these two 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:25.700
 tips inventions tutorials and 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.400
 and we go here on Friday many 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.790
 thanks for being there and a very little kiss 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.790
 strong to all 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.349
 plus
