00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 Hi everyone, so here I am 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.210
 back with a new video and today you 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.400
 I propose a new face of the day 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.050
 today I really wanted to make up 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.259
 I had really wanted to take a 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.260
 little care of me anyway I saw the stress 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.350
 the last few days and so I also have a 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.199
 let's say exaggerated then let's start 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.330
 immediately with regards to the base 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.099
 nothing new the only thing that is 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.890
 changed was the foundation I have 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.619
 also given a little like saying one 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.239
 small concession 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:36.630
 I had already since last winter a 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.850
 small sample of naked foundation 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.719
 of gay Rome and it is beautiful like it from 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.340
 to die 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.780
 I know it is full of crap but me 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.430
 liked a lot I like it very much 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.370
 the effect so I put what I have 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.199
 put my usual face powder say ball but 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.550
 regarding blush and with touring 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:57.420
 for the touring he used the 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.579
 new land of snow cosmetics calari la 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.129
 very nice mind has a pretty tone 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.989
 cold but honestly does not convince me 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.770
 at least for the moment not that much 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.689
 I know I don't know from the video camera what 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.210
 in fact it can come out maybe I see it 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.040
 better either editing though it is 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.040
 really very light in the sense that 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.140
 to make the effect look tanned 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.540
 the contouring effect a little more marked 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.240
 you really have to go and get it 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.340
 so much product so I am not 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.619
 still so convinced and then on the cheeks 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.079
 once again used the flirting 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.240
 always the new blush blush of the 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.250
 of the last snow collection ever 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.049
 I wanted this on the orange point 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.259
 however recall ecological make-up 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.060
 folds of the lips since there are 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.100
 let's talk about the lips and then let 's go 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.170
 I said to my eyes 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.020
 used the new snow pastel 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.409
 lobster that just this color 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.060
 coral and is perfectly combined with 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.090
 this lipstick that I already owned of 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.850
 owe the number 15 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.460
 electric lips this is a lot 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.960
 translucent let's say the color 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.030
 obviously you see what you see 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.660
 however from the packaging it is not 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.580
 really crazy and very very polished 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.599
 very nice very comfortable too 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.330
 on the lips 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.810
 now let's go straight to make up 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.019
 eyes 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.390
 now let's start right away with makeup 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:23.420
 eyes as a base this time I have 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.360
 used the lemonade I had 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.709
 really it was so long I wanted to say 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.480
 use a base that was 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:33.470
 completely watt because I didn't want to 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.510
 however no kind of small for the 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.579
 sciences that he could give maybe 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.099
 face national insurance and so I have 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:42.200
 just put the lemonade on the whole 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.480
 eyelid this color that just a 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.940
 color looks a lot like the software of 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.239
 mac so to speak then I started 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.640
 putting the color in the fold and ho 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.190
 made a mix of two colors I do 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.579
 I don't always like these mixes 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.459
 use a single color then useful 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:03.859
 or still wet hair 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.750
 we omit then I took one of the 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:08.150
 new eye shadows and always in the classroom 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.720
 this would be the rush if not 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.599
 I tell myself right away I rast the plage 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.849
 rast is really beautiful almost embra 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.560
 butter when I do n't like the applet to you 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:20.840
 the fact that it is so dusty that 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.660
 so away so much glue is 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.519
 really a color it deserves and that 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.340
 mixed slightly with a small one 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.750
 push pin with this kiko eye shadow that 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.060
 a copper color 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.190
 this is a bit warmer as a undertone 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.560
 this instead a little colder and it is the 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.389
 number 137 precisely I went to 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.030
 find it with a brush enough 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:42.680
 wide shade in the fold where it is 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.599
 then open the eye between the eyelid 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.019
 mobile and the fixed eyelid instead are 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:51.470
 went to get this color this 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:53.900
 here that would be trinacria trinacria not 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.660
 I know I only got one trinacria 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.700
 of the palette of makeup delight precisely 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.370
 this one here really too much 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.440
 beautiful so I put it precisely in the 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.860
 fold and then as color instead on 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.990
 mobile eyelid 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.860
 this old kind of stick that 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:13.770
 I'm wrong or on 22 states ago 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:17.609
 probably the english bloom after le 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.829
 sad green I took the brown color 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.840
 crazy this building I have to say that in the 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.690
 practically never was use anyway 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.510
 really a like saying a purchase 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.370
 really wrong using it 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.200
 only to take this color 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.390
 so for the dark brown 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.590
 I put on the eyelid and 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:38.970
 the gradient with the colors in the fold 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.750
 then I went to do one 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:45.600
 a very rich fruit is very rich 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:47.610
 thin line compliments of 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.550
 really very thin eyeliner with 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:55.410
 this was my new eyeliner 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:57.240
 sent and is from derna so it is presented 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.970
 all so are those who have 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.790
 practically the super thin brush 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.320
 super flexible to this one for the 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:08.040
 moment is the first application that 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:10.770
 I liked it 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.990
 let's see how long we test today the 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.120
 duration for eyelashes 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.070
 I went I finished my big eyes 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.710
 so I went to fish this out 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.750
 here of rim bella I thought it was if 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.120
 who instead still beautiful liquid and 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:28.410
 scandal ice this here by rimmel 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:30.300
 orange then in the rhyme instead internal 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.790
 of the eye I went to put the 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.520
 essence pencil is the jella eyeliner 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:38.190
 that of the last one of the last 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.960
 essence exits is how color they are 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.210
 went almost to fade the brown 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.810
 that used on your mobile up 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:47.810
 here and then as we say point light then 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:51.000
 which then went on to say fade with 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:54.600
 other color or always used rast 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.620
 of nabla this was the face of the day 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.060
 of today 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.590
 I hope you enjoyed even gods 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.530
 hair practically wet but 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:03.060
 we leave out this small detail 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.720
 I send you a kiss and see you there 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.410

 Hello
