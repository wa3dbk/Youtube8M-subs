another<00:00:47.640> important<00:00:48.210> collection<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.690> we

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
another important collection that we

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.689 
another important collection that we
have<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.109> here<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:50.839> the<00:00:51.839> type<00:00:52.079> collection<00:00:52.699> the

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
have in here is the type collection the

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.419 
have in here is the type collection the
types<00:00:53.969> are<00:00:54.390> specimens<00:00:55.289> which<00:00:55.530> researchers

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:56.429 
types are specimens which researchers

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:00.169 
types are specimens which researchers
used<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:58.070> describe<00:00:59.070> species<00:00:59.609> when<00:01:00.059> they

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:00.179 
used to describe species when they

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:02.479 
used to describe species when they
describe<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.660> species<00:01:01.079> they<00:01:01.769> designate<00:01:02.280> a

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
describe a species they designate a

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.020 
describe a species they designate a
specimen<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.149> represent<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:04.170> species<00:01:04.440> and

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
specimen to represent that species and

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.900 
specimen to represent that species and
so<00:01:06.030> these<00:01:06.180> are<00:01:06.240> very<00:01:06.480> very<00:01:06.720> important

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
so these are very very important

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.120 
so these are very very important
