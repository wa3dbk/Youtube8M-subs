00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.580
 Huh 

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:07.500
 It is a faint rice tournament yesterday 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.170
 Daytime industrial tax 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:19.360
 First to arky et al . 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:21.190
 Things like that and the fighting in and went up to the tournament and Well Yamato players 3 win 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.830
 The 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:29.060
 I can depopulate this time 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.130
 We could advance piece to Shinjuku face 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.579
 Huh 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.170
 This time is only that Kazuma player 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.370
 What 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.969
 With an emphasis 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.969
 from now 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:47.710
 This in my 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:53.690
 To so get used to things that Kazuma capture mode 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:58.660
 It's hard to go up in a tournament like this 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.660
 Because it can be squeezed to only one point 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.150
 Oh dear 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:08.970
 Even though I know the first time of the fight 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:13.780
 Well and wonder if it is possible to win in Adama 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.980
 It is over capture 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.570
 eh 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.720
 This tournament or tournament is good 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.390
 The is good Shi foot 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.530
 I do n't think that great compatibility really makes sense 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.930
 This tournament 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:38.060
 I must win by whatever hand I use 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:38.060
 The number of this Prada wins with any hand as Sakamoto 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.409
 I can not 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:47.869
 The same ambassador does not come 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:50.310
 Clearly speaking, it is incompatible with Tanaka, maybe 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.659
 Even in obstacle achievements 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.590
 I do not Maybe not me 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:02:01.250
 I love you so bad that I love you 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:06.230
 Well anyway the next Face Shinjuku Face tournament 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:09.420
 I wanted to focus only on clearing the 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:14.020
 Well yesterday 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.700
 Of the sea in the main of the evening club meeting 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.040
 Look at the game 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.410
 I feel a little sane 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.370
 I think 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.410
 Oh dear 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.950
 In addition to it 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.400
 that 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.260
 Post-match comments 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.690
 It's Wakan either lost or won 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:36.130
 It 13 I 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.890
 I'm getting angry for a moment 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.880
 Oh dear 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:45.290
 I would like to concentrate on the next Shinjuku Face event 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.290
 That won 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.460
 Sea belt after all 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.750
 I have to take it 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.730
 I felt it 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.590
 that's all 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.970
 Ha 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.280
 yesterday 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.569
 that 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.030
 champion 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.030
 It is Kyoro Ikemen Jiro who won Kai player 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.780
 next 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.370
 The match partner is Tatsumi 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.890
 Originally a teacher 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:18.420
 A single with the other old man is absolute 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.420
 Win with tarantula 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.930
 finish 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:31.270
 Well Well Well third largest body Well 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:34.690
 In terms of a young player six months old 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.460
 Though there is a part of the room in feeling 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.990
 Huh 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:42.880
 Yesterday's game 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.880
 Nepe fake champion 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.130
 Kai is Ano 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.950
 Say that I saved the feet 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.590
 Like that 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:56.830
 I was shown the function 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:04:00.820
 I wonder if you 'll just scoop your feet just beyond the hot water 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.770
 Maa battle 4 game and whoever the opponent is 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.569
 What 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:11.740
 If you want to win a victory 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:12.980
 Well good is there I have a function in the paddle players had you home 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:18.459
 What is that? 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.459
 Growth of the next leg also thought that want to go firmly 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:29.980
 Soy sour taste in the first round with yesterday's ramen 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:35.260
 Although inter-bought it was or even now Hisashi Matsu Even now my 須時is I do not know 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:38.700
 At the next Shinjuku Face tournament, I will try my best to help me 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.700
 I want I think more and 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.740
 Toka was known Nante 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.920
 Yes 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.430
 Huh 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.940
 I was thrust in with a time difference 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:57.120
 tarantula 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:05:02.639
 If you go to the tarantula or use the sales promotion you will definitely win 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:05.719
 Say win in the tooth launcher in the sense that Miseru beyond the teacher say 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.719
 It was a finger 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.650
 finish 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.050
 Let's be a monster 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.930
 I hope this tournament that 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:37.380
 That where I say Rutte to participate 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:45.990
 Say will what about as a champion, but I was also a wind place 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:46.919
 a this rather than the inside of me that went up wins in this tournament to get a challenge right 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.860
 The 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:52.500
 Depending on what went up wins in the tournament thought was true of champions 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.380
 I am 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:06:02.390
 8 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:07.110
 That is why he is losing 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:10.860
 Well, in the first place he's a belt 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:15.860
 Hey spill it yourself 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:17.249
 Though I have my own now with my own hole 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:21.479
 Oh dear 

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:23.569
 I think that it is Re also fluke say I took the honest Muto participation 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:24.849
 Probably 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:31.539
 Just maa 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:33.160
 My guy comes out and this is thought and itself Well I have come up with non-negative aura of the restaurant in 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:36.389
 I wonder 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:38.350
 That as soon as possible 

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:41.260
 In order to break down 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:44.050
 Guy guy is the other guy than to have the belt 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.540
 No I have one 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.680
 Is it not good ? 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.680
 There is such a feeling 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:54.400
 8 Yesterday I 

00:06:52.689 --> 00:07:01.400
 Cutter to break up 

00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:04.479
 That's why I had always wanted to get rid of the last round-in 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.479
 But I won 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.360
 If it is a title match, I am the champion right now 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:17.950
 cold sake 

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:19.350
 Yesterday I saw the share close on the second but 

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:22.520
 After all 

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.520
 As a group champion 

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:28.569
 Because 3 crown and will capture the 

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:30.440
 I felt that was not good 

00:07:28.569 --> 00:07:35.660
 that's all 

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:37.920
 I am not good, but I lost because it was weak 

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:40.730
 9 degrees standard it 

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.730
 that's all
