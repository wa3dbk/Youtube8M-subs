Clone<00:01:02.430> Wars<00:01:02.460> figures<00:01:02.940> do<00:01:03.120> feature<00:01:03.390> the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
Clone Wars figures do feature the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.690 
Clone Wars figures do feature the
Galactic<00:01:04.260> battle<00:01:04.559> game<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.250> you've<00:01:05.430> got<00:01:05.610> an

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
Galactic battle game so you've got an

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.940 
Galactic battle game so you've got an
area<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.210> packaging<00:01:06.659> where<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.990> card<00:01:07.320> the

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
area of the packaging where the card the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.420 
area of the packaging where the card the
display<00:01:08.430> stand<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.299> die<00:01:09.570> are<00:01:10.430> packaged

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
display stand and the die are packaged

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.039 
display stand and the die are packaged
and<00:01:11.610> that's<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:12.540> barrier<00:01:12.840> which<00:01:13.020> is

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
and that's this barrier which is

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.320 
and that's this barrier which is
obviously<00:01:13.500> got<00:01:13.710> an<00:01:13.799> orange<00:01:14.040> border<00:01:14.970> which<00:01:15.180> I

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
obviously got an orange border which I

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.749 
obviously got an orange border which I
think<00:01:15.540> really<00:01:15.900> looks<00:01:16.799> out<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.040> place<00:01:17.159> on<00:01:17.640> this

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
think really looks out of place on this

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.090 
think really looks out of place on this
packaging<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.650> think<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.770> should<00:01:19.920> have<00:01:20.009> been

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
packaging I think that should have been

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.670 
packaging I think that should have been
grey<00:01:20.460> or<00:01:20.790> black<00:01:21.270> or<00:01:21.630> blue<00:01:21.900> or<00:01:21.930> something<00:01:22.320> that

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
grey or black or blue or something that

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.399 
grey or black or blue or something that
just<00:01:22.860> made<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.070> flow<00:01:23.520> back<00:01:23.960> with<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.080> rest<00:01:25.229> of

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
just made it flow back with the rest of

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.450 
just made it flow back with the rest of
the<00:01:25.470> packaging<00:01:25.920> but<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.640> digress<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:28.430> got<00:01:29.430> a

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
the packaging but I digress and got a

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.550 
the packaging but I digress and got a
very<00:01:29.610> cool<00:01:29.729> image<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.600> police<00:01:30.869> officer<00:01:31.259> in
