00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.169
 I welcome all fans of the network 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.210
 battles on communication tank slot and today I 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:20.369
 prepared for you a small round in 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.220
 connection mode on the card sunken 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.560
 the dragon that I ended up with a score of 19 0 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.630
 as you see this guy appeared not in 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.060
 the most successful moment and immediately went 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.250
 on the respawn screen in the course of today 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.170
 video I will try to explain in detail 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.880
 all my actions and hope it is 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.090
 will help you when you next time 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.070
 enter the game in connection mode is important 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.290
 not how much flag you captured in total 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.870
 difficulty from and how many flags are you 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.700
 connected in series just that you 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.130
 seen as an enemy flag tore 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.660
 the chain of our team it was very 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.840
 smart move on their part 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.920
 instead of capturing flags 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.180
 one after another and with 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.460
 sides of their base 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.100
 they immediately took the flag closer to 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.559
 to our database and thereby deprived us immediately 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.320
 2 connections and this is one of the most 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.270
 effective tactics in this mode if 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.909
 your team is pressed tightly then not 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.799
 it is worth going head-on at the enemy because 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.229
 most likely they will gather near 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.749
 closest flag and prevent any of your 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.549
 attempt to break much more efficiently 

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:23.429
 will sneak into the enemy's rear and 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.829
 grab a point away not closest to 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:28.229
 enemy base a second or third with 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:30.840
 the end because in this way both of you 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.119
 tear at once two compounds of course 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.280
 this is not always easy but never 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.979
 do not be afraid to rush forward 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.810
 Of course the team needs players who 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.539
 will stay near the flags or 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.689
 transmitters and defend them this is also not 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.939
 easy task but your team never 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.670
 do not win without aggressive players 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.100
 like i said before never stands 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.899
 afraid to rush forward because the worst 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.539
 what could happen is you just 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.850
 earn another death but at best 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.609
 If you grab a foothold and 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.920
 respawna for his team even if everyone 

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:06.689
 the rest are sitting and doing nothing 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.299
 doesn't mean you have to follow them 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.590
 example if you see the possibility then 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.780
 use her 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.640
 break through the enemy's rear but it's not 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.670
 mean you have to run headlong 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.800
 and do not look around at all I already 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.550
 said it a million times earlier and say 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:27.090
 a million more times, always look at your 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:30.030
 mini card always damn it 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.160
 valuable sources of information throughout the game 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.739
 it may seem too simple 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.200
 to mention so often but 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.480
 still in 90 percent of deaths 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.730
 can be avoided if at time to look 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.130
 on the minimap the opponent will appear on 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.530
 minimap if will use weapons 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.360
 without a silencer even if he sneezes without 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.459
 silencer is lit on the minimap 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.769
 it will also appear if at least 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.260
 will someone from your team look 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.780
 Of course, it will be visible on the map if 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.090
 it will highlight through the orders menu and 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.730
 of course if the server is great 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.519
 and a terrible memory commander drone 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.959
 then 99 percent of the players are always 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.090
 highlighted on the map 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.069
 but the vision and the only sources 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.849
 information on which you must 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.400
 rely 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.500
 the world around you is full of sounds that 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.600
 can easily betray your opponent 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.579
 First of all these are the sounds of footsteps 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.500
 always be careful about this 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.720
 about if you heard nearby 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.670
 some tramp look at 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.190
 minimap if allies are there 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.200
 if they are not there then it is definitely opponents 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.000
 and you should be careful try 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.160
 determine which side comes from 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.200
 sound though it's not always easy 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.389
 because in the battlefield 4 steps sounds 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.069
 much quieter than in the same battlefield 3 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:43.380
 but on test servers over it 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.720
 work the volume of enemy steps 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.410
 increased the volume of the steps of the allies 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.450
 lowered 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.799
 that is, now hears the enemy and 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.260
 determine which side he is 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:54.269
 approaches will be much more easier 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.130
 just before the main game these changes 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.700
 will get to sleep than which will come out in 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.919
 September 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.139
 but apart from enemy moves 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:03.419
 reload sound or even broken sound 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:05.459
 glass as you most likely know 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:07.109
 when using the muffler you are not 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.299
 appear on the minimap during 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:11.579
 shooting but the same goes for your 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.989
 opponent so if you hear the sound 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.609
 gun with a silencer again 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.489
 look at the minimap 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:19.650
 if near allies if near you you 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.930
 you know what to do but there are still sounds 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.770
 which players cannot control 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.780
 but none the less 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.879
 and they can either easily issue your 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.729
 position or help you a lot 

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:31.889
 when you throw a grenade or enemy 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:34.560
 a grenade lands near you or 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.300
 let's say next to you kill an ally in 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.550
 any of these cases your fighter 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.740
 shouts out some sort of cue you 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.720
 do not hear but also hear well 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.000
 opponents if you play against 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.830
 the Chinese then their screams are very different 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.110
 just well and if you play against 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.449
 Russians or Americans then their voices 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.430
 quite similar but still distinguish them 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:55.830
 but you can hear it all 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.050
 not just keep your ears open 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.819
 very much depends on what 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.710
 the way you play sound 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:04.470
 use in my opinion the perfect 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.060
 option is of course headphones now 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.759
 many manufacturers offer 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.979
 virtual system 7 and 1 it has long been 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:13.259
 no novelty I can not competently 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:15.449
 talk about all the options I can say 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:16.949
 only that i use it 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:19.590
 g35 log house 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:21.990
 I can say that these are great headphones with 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.370
 sound quality is not just happening so 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.430
 what I heard someone behind me 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.979
 gets a knife I turned around and it saved 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.020
 my life is a sound system 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.789
 the most underrated part of your 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.430
 computer no mechanical 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:37.259
 the keyboard in the world won't help you play 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.300
 better if you plan something 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:41.580
 update then you better take care of 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.130
 its only sound system 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.529
 the problem is that the g35 headphones are not from 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:49.229
 cheap but I bought them for about two years 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:51.210
 back and never regretted it 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:53.029
 there is as we already found out today 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.770
 game time is worth very carefully 

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:57.960
 listen to the surroundings they play 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.539
 to your favorite songs and sit though 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.969
 pretty cool you don't like isi disi 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:04.949
 very vain so when you in 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:07.020
 next time you will wonder 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:09.120
 how did this guy even realize that I'm here 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.310
 think about all of what we are today 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.830
 have talked it all may seem 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.690
 very simple but observing these 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.699
 elementary rules you can 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:20.639
 significantly extend your life on the field 

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:23.150
 combat even if you choose the best weapon 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:25.409
 in the game and hang it up the coolest 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.659
 modifications all this will not have 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:29.340
 no value if you won't 

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:32.070
 observe only a couple 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.180
 elementary rules and here are the charges 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:36.610
 cheating unfortunately they are on it 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:39.130
 with whom I took apart only the word hack 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:41.440
 I have everything on it if you are today 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.930
 learned something new for yourself and 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.729
 just had a good time don't forget 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.560
 rate the video and don’t forget 

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:49.360
 subscribe to the channel and look into 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.110
 description to visit the community 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.750
 in contact with 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:55.410
 thank you very much for watching before new 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.410
 meeting
