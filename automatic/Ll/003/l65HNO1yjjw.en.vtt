15
on<00:02:05.440> the<00:02:05.560> fifth<00:02:05.800> so

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.270 

then<00:02:10.460> you<00:02:10.580> can<00:02:10.729> go<00:02:10.850> 15

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.360 

then<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.150> go<00:02:18.300> down<00:02:18.480> 14<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.470> 14

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.510 

then<00:02:23.730> you<00:02:23.819> go<00:02:23.940> open<00:02:24.239> it<00:02:24.299> down

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.050 

so<00:02:33.260> it<00:02:33.350> should<00:02:33.500> sound<00:02:33.620> like<00:02:33.740> this

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.030 

and<00:02:39.450> for<00:02:39.810> people<00:02:40.080> who<00:02:40.140> can<00:02:40.319> just<00:02:40.680> see<00:02:40.830> it<00:02:40.920> from

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
and for people who can just see it from

then<00:02:49.159> after<00:02:49.519> that<00:02:49.640> there's<00:02:50.299> a<00:02:50.420> second<00:02:50.900> sort<00:02:51.109> of

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
then after that there's a second sort of

then after that there's a second sort of
breath<00:02:51.439> and<00:02:51.650> it<00:02:51.769> goes

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.460 

that's<00:02:56.210> quite<00:02:56.360> easy<00:02:56.600> it's<00:02:57.050> pretty<00:02:57.260> much<00:02:57.380> the

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.430 
414
you

fourth

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.050 
fourth
then<00:04:21.120> you<00:04:21.180> go<00:04:21.650> 17<00:04:22.650> on<00:04:23.129> the<00:04:23.190> third

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
then you go 17 on the third

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.900 
then you go 17 on the third
in<00:04:25.480> fact<00:04:25.750> to<00:04:25.930> the<00:04:26.020> 15<00:04:26.410> and<00:04:26.800> forth<00:04:27.100> into<00:04:27.730> the

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
in fact to the 15 and forth into the

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.710 
in fact to the 15 and forth into the
14th<00:04:28.360> on<00:04:28.660> 4th<00:04:29.070> then<00:04:30.070> you<00:04:30.639> go<00:04:30.820> to<00:04:31.090> the<00:04:31.150> 15th<00:04:31.570> on

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
14th on 4th then you go to the 15th on

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.370 
14th on 4th then you go to the 15th on
the<00:04:31.960> fifth<00:04:32.230> so<00:04:33.190> no<00:04:33.250> sound<00:04:33.490> like

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.050 

so<00:04:37.980> you<00:04:38.040> got<00:04:38.250> it<00:04:38.340> there<00:04:38.780> so<00:04:40.460> it's<00:04:41.460> really<00:04:41.850> weird

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
so you got it there so it's really weird

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.970 
so you got it there so it's really weird
actually<00:04:42.990> it's<00:04:43.110> not<00:04:43.260> at<00:04:43.350> the<00:04:43.410> same<00:04:43.560> time<00:04:43.770> but

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
actually it's not at the same time but

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.770 
actually it's not at the same time but
you<00:04:44.160> go

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
you go

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.230 
you go
you

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.770 

so<00:04:51.810> instead<00:04:52.080> of<00:04:52.139> going

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:02.200 

you<00:04:55.320> go<00:04:57.410> that's<00:04:58.410> not<00:04:58.560> a<00:04:58.590> third<00:04:58.950> rep<00:05:00.200> third<00:05:01.200> row

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
you go that's not a third rep third row

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.340 
you go that's not a third rep third row
if<00:05:03.210> you<00:05:03.360> don't<00:05:03.510> know<00:05:03.600> what<00:05:03.660> a<00:05:03.750> rep<00:05:03.960> is<00:05:04.110> it's

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
if you don't know what a rep is it's

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.610 
if you don't know what a rep is it's
which<00:05:04.980> you<00:05:05.160> probably<00:05:05.430> should<00:05:05.790> learn<00:05:06.000> it's

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
which you probably should learn it's

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.850 
which you probably should learn it's
when<00:05:07.620> you<00:05:07.830> play<00:05:08.340> a<00:05:08.690> sort<00:05:09.690> of<00:05:09.750> like<00:05:09.900> a<00:05:10.020> riff<00:05:10.290> and

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
when you play a sort of like a riff and

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.930 
when you play a sort of like a riff and
I<00:05:11.190> what's<00:05:12.150> it<00:05:12.300> called<00:05:12.510> Rep<00:05:13.260> I<00:05:13.530> guess<00:05:13.950> if<00:05:14.790> you

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
I what's it called Rep I guess if you

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.430 
I what's it called Rep I guess if you
play<00:05:15.150> it<00:05:15.180> like<00:05:15.389> over<00:05:15.690> and<00:05:15.810> over<00:05:15.840> again<00:05:16.080> I<00:05:16.230> guess

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
play it like over and over again I guess

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.110 
play it like over and over again I guess
I<00:05:16.680> would<00:05:16.860> be<00:05:17.040> what<00:05:17.370> it<00:05:17.490> means<00:05:18.290> so<00:05:20.090> you've<00:05:21.090> got

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
I would be what it means so you've got

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:37.740 
I would be what it means so you've got
the<00:05:21.389> intro<00:05:21.780> and

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:43.170 

so<00:05:40.000> that's<00:05:41.000> all<00:05:41.330> i<00:05:41.360> got<00:05:41.659> for<00:05:41.719> right<00:05:42.169> now<00:05:42.349> but

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
so that's all i got for right now but

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.890 
so that's all i got for right now but
i'll<00:05:44.180> watch<00:05:44.449> part<00:05:44.780> two<00:05:45.020> and<00:05:45.259> you'll<00:05:46.219> learn<00:05:46.430> the

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
i'll watch part two and you'll learn the

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:59.660 
i'll watch part two and you'll learn the
this

00:05:59.660 --> 00:05:59.670 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:05.360 

well<00:06:00.350> that's<00:06:01.350> all<00:06:01.530> for<00:06:01.650> now<00:06:01.710> but<00:06:02.310> see<00:06:02.970> ya<00:06:03.060> guys
