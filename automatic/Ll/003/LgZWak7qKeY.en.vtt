00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.930 
least to soak up as much as I can so
what's<00:03:39.350> important<00:03:39.860> is<00:03:39.980> that<00:03:40.010> I<00:03:40.989> don't<00:03:41.989> go<00:03:42.200> down

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
what's important is that I don't go down

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:49.600 
what's important is that I don't go down
hitting<00:03:43.940> all<00:03:44.120> this<00:03:44.239> oil

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.500 

I'd<00:03:50.610> say<00:03:50.819> I'm<00:03:50.909> worried<00:03:51.150> about<00:03:51.180> other<00:03:51.450> people

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
I'd say I'm worried about other people

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.360 
I'd say I'm worried about other people
in<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.900> neighborhood<00:03:52.260> but<00:03:52.470> there's<00:03:52.709> like<00:03:52.920> two

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
in the neighborhood but there's like two

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.089 
in the neighborhood but there's like two
motorcycles<00:03:54.030> and<00:03:54.120> that's<00:03:54.299> it<00:03:57.830> so<00:03:58.830> let's<00:03:58.860> see

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
motorcycles and that's it so let's see

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.440 
motorcycles and that's it so let's see
how<00:03:59.190> this<00:03:59.310> stuff<00:03:59.549> does<00:03:59.849> I'm<00:04:00.030> used<00:04:00.209> to<00:04:00.269> using

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
how this stuff does I'm used to using

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.420 
how this stuff does I'm used to using
this<00:04:00.659> stuff<00:04:00.870> it's<00:04:01.049> like<00:04:01.110> kitty<00:04:01.440> litter<00:04:01.650> this

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
this stuff it's like kitty litter this

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.729 
this stuff it's like kitty litter this
is<00:04:02.610> all<00:04:02.790> Home<00:04:03.060> Depot<00:04:03.420> had<00:04:03.690> it's<00:04:03.989> a<00:04:04.110> zip<00:04:04.349> brand

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
is all Home Depot had it's a zip brand

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.410 
is all Home Depot had it's a zip brand
and<00:04:05.069> it's<00:04:06.030> more<00:04:06.239> like<00:04:06.390> a<00:04:07.280> bow<00:04:08.280> it's<00:04:09.060> got<00:04:09.269> the

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
and it's more like a bow it's got the

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.570 
and it's more like a bow it's got the
texture<00:04:09.750> of<00:04:09.900> sand<00:04:11.360> but<00:04:12.360> the<00:04:12.510> consistency<00:04:13.290> of

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
texture of sand but the consistency of

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.020 
texture of sand but the consistency of
powder<00:04:14.580> like<00:04:15.299> a<00:04:15.329> telc<00:04:15.690> powder

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.210 

it's<00:04:19.989> nothing<00:04:20.260> I<00:04:20.350> can<00:04:20.530> do<00:04:20.590> about<00:04:20.739> that<00:04:20.799> huge

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
it's nothing I can do about that huge

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.120 
it's nothing I can do about that huge
swath<00:04:21.910> out<00:04:22.180> there<00:04:22.450> I<00:04:22.480> mean<00:04:22.690> I<00:04:23.010> don't<00:04:24.010> have

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
swath out there I mean I don't have

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.050 
swath out there I mean I don't have
enough<00:04:24.340> material<00:04:25.620> and<00:04:26.620> it's<00:04:27.460> all<00:04:27.610> in<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:27.910> main

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
enough material and it's all in the main

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.400 
enough material and it's all in the main
road<00:04:28.330> because<00:04:28.630> people<00:04:28.930> have<00:04:29.020> been<00:04:29.140> tracking

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
road because people have been tracking

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.550 
road because people have been tracking
it<00:04:29.620> out<00:04:29.800> of<00:04:30.160> course<00:04:30.490> with<00:04:30.670> the<00:04:30.790> cars<00:04:32.970> so<00:04:33.970> I

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
it out of course with the cars so I

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.870 
it out of course with the cars so I
think<00:04:35.560> what's<00:04:35.860> best<00:04:36.100> is<00:04:36.340> I<00:04:36.430> just<00:04:36.490> leave<00:04:36.850> it

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
think what's best is I just leave it

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.870 
think what's best is I just leave it
here<00:04:37.300> to<00:04:37.570> kind<00:04:37.840> of<00:04:37.900> soak<00:04:38.140> up

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.390 

I<00:04:43.050> was<00:04:44.050> going<00:04:44.200> to<00:04:44.260> sweep<00:04:44.500> it<00:04:44.680> up<00:04:44.800> but<00:04:45.280> this

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
I was going to sweep it up but this

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.790 
I was going to sweep it up but this
stuff<00:04:45.640> isn't<00:04:45.850> clumping<00:04:46.570> like<00:04:46.780> that<00:04:46.990> the<00:04:47.770> other

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
stuff isn't clumping like that the other

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.580 
stuff isn't clumping like that the other
stuff<00:04:48.190> I'm<00:04:48.370> used<00:04:48.580> to<00:04:49.020> and<00:04:50.020> at<00:04:50.110> least<00:04:50.260> this<00:04:50.380> way

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
stuff I'm used to and at least this way

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.400 
stuff I'm used to and at least this way
I<00:04:50.620> can<00:04:50.710> kind<00:04:51.070> of<00:04:51.720> spread<00:04:52.720> it<00:04:52.750> around<00:04:52.930> as<00:04:53.200> much

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
I can kind of spread it around as much

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.870 
I can kind of spread it around as much
as<00:04:53.560> possible<00:04:53.800> to<00:04:54.190> help<00:04:56.490> so<00:04:57.490> I'll<00:04:57.610> go<00:04:57.760> in
