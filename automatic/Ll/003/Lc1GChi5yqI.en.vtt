rig that i made up i just took the light
out<00:00:30.369> of<00:00:30.430> the<00:00:30.520> package<00:00:30.910> and<00:00:32.370> first<00:00:33.370> thing<00:00:33.520> I

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:33.580 
out of the package and first thing I

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.000 
out of the package and first thing I
noticed<00:00:33.940> is<00:00:34.030> the<00:00:34.500> diffusing<00:00:35.500> shield<00:00:35.770> that's

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
noticed is the diffusing shield that's

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.920 
noticed is the diffusing shield that's
on<00:00:36.100> the<00:00:36.190> front<00:00:36.460> here<00:00:36.629> slides<00:00:37.629> right<00:00:37.750> out

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
on the front here slides right out

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.470 
on the front here slides right out
pretty<00:00:38.650> cool<00:00:38.970> inside<00:00:39.970> there's<00:00:40.210> a<00:00:40.269> little

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
pretty cool inside there's a little

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.049 
pretty cool inside there's a little
clear<00:00:40.900> plastic<00:00:41.230> you<00:00:41.590> gotta<00:00:41.830> peel<00:00:42.070> off<00:00:42.280> where

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
clear plastic you gotta peel off where

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.420 
clear plastic you gotta peel off where
that<00:00:43.300> now<00:00:44.260> the<00:00:44.320> shield<00:00:44.710> is<00:00:44.830> cool<00:00:45.070> because<00:00:45.190> it

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
that now the shield is cool because it

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.889 
that now the shield is cool because it
actually<00:00:45.580> diffuses<00:00:46.180> the<00:00:46.210> light<00:00:46.329> instead<00:00:46.840> of

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
actually diffuses the light instead of

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:49.040 
actually diffuses the light instead of
having<00:00:47.110> a<00:00:47.260> full<00:00:47.469> stream<00:00:47.770> all<00:00:47.950> time<00:00:48.280> you<00:00:48.460> can

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
having a full stream all time you can

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.209 
having a full stream all time you can
spread<00:00:50.050> it<00:00:50.110> out<00:00:50.260> better<00:00:50.500> with<00:00:50.710> the<00:00:50.800> diffuser

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
spread it out better with the diffuser

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:52.920 
spread it out better with the diffuser
it's<00:00:51.579> not<00:00:51.760> on<00:00:51.910> your<00:00:52.120> end<00:00:52.270> put<00:00:52.450> the<00:00:52.540> batteries

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
it's not on your end put the batteries

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.580 
it's not on your end put the batteries
in<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:54.190> first<00:00:54.550> thing<00:00:54.700> I'm<00:00:54.790> going<00:00:54.879> to<00:00:54.940> do

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
in so first thing I'm going to do

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.190 
in so first thing I'm going to do
there's<00:00:56.590> two<00:00:56.739> ways<00:00:56.860> to<00:00:56.920> mount<00:00:57.250> this<00:00:57.460> basically

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
there's two ways to mount this basically

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.619 
there's two ways to mount this basically
first<00:00:59.200> one<00:00:59.440> is<00:00:59.649> the<00:01:00.640> way<00:01:00.760> it<00:01:00.879> comes<00:01:01.059> it's

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
first one is the way it comes it's

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:03.930 
first one is the way it comes it's
designed<00:01:01.960> to<00:01:02.200> fit<00:01:02.410> on<00:01:02.559> a<00:01:02.590> hot<00:01:02.800> shoe<00:01:03.010> that

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
designed to fit on a hot shoe that

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.639 
designed to fit on a hot shoe that
little<00:01:04.210> thing<00:01:04.360> right<00:01:04.600> there<00:01:04.809> it's<00:01:05.020> you<00:01:05.500> can

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:05.649 
little thing right there it's you can

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:07.109 
little thing right there it's you can
tighten<00:01:05.920> that<00:01:05.979> up<00:01:06.039> put<00:01:06.610> it<00:01:06.700> on<00:01:06.789> top<00:01:06.910> of<00:01:06.970> your

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
tighten that up put it on top of your

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.480 
tighten that up put it on top of your
camera<00:01:07.570> tighten<00:01:08.229> that<00:01:08.289> up<00:01:08.350> that's<00:01:09.070> hot<00:01:09.280> shoe

mount<00:01:09.670> I'm<00:01:10.420> not<00:01:10.630> really<00:01:10.869> going<00:01:10.960> to<00:01:11.050> be<00:01:11.140> using

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
mount I'm not really going to be using

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.260 
mount I'm not really going to be using
it<00:01:11.470> for<00:01:11.649> that<00:01:11.740> purpose<00:01:12.190> I'm<00:01:12.940> going<00:01:13.119> to<00:01:13.210> be

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
it for that purpose I'm going to be

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.840 
it for that purpose I'm going to be
using<00:01:13.360> it<00:01:13.630> more<00:01:13.810> for<00:01:14.140> this<00:01:14.340> spring<00:01:15.340> clamp<00:01:15.610> set

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.060 
using it more for this spring clamp set
up<00:01:16.000> and<00:01:16.240> the<00:01:16.810> way<00:01:16.899> this<00:01:16.960> works<00:01:17.320> is<00:01:17.590> it<00:01:17.920> actually

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
up and the way this works is it actually

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.280 
up and the way this works is it actually
has<00:01:18.400> a<00:01:19.799> sort<00:01:20.799> of<00:01:20.860> a<00:01:21.330> ball<00:01:22.330> mount<00:01:22.540> on<00:01:22.810> the<00:01:22.900> top<00:01:23.110> of

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
end of the light and you notice a flat

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.389 
end of the light and you notice a flat
surface<00:01:58.780> right<00:01:59.110> there<00:01:59.380> we're<00:02:00.130> going<00:02:00.220> to<00:02:00.310> take

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
surface right there we're going to take

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:01.679 
surface right there we're going to take
the<00:02:00.520> drill<00:02:00.759> bit<00:02:00.970> we're<00:02:01.180> going<00:02:01.270> to<00:02:01.329> Center<00:02:01.659> it

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
the drill bit we're going to Center it

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:04.260 
the drill bit we're going to Center it
more<00:02:02.259> or<00:02:02.350> less<00:02:02.530> right<00:02:03.100> in<00:02:03.220> there<00:02:03.399> and<00:02:03.610> roll<00:02:04.180> it

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
more or less right in there and roll it

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.309 
more or less right in there and roll it
straight<00:02:04.360> in

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.759 

and<00:02:09.319> then<00:02:09.819> take<00:02:10.819> that<00:02:11.000> out<00:02:11.150> of<00:02:11.239> the<00:02:11.330> drill<00:02:11.769> put

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
and then take that out of the drill put

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:20.040 
and then take that out of the drill put
these<00:02:12.950> tap<00:02:13.790> in<00:02:16.690> just<00:02:17.690> go<00:02:17.810> right<00:02:17.930> in<00:02:18.050> like<00:02:18.200> that

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
these tap in just go right in like that

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:28.340 
these tap in just go right in like that
holy<00:02:21.050> in<00:02:21.410> all<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:23.780> way<00:02:23.900> up

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.750 

and<00:02:29.350> there<00:02:29.470> you<00:02:29.530> go<00:02:29.590> you<00:02:29.770> got<00:02:29.800> a<00:02:29.920> quarter<00:02:30.160> 23<00:02:30.700> i

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
and there you go you got a quarter 23 i

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.960 
and there you go you got a quarter 23 i
read<00:02:30.940> in<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.090> end<00:02:31.210> of<00:02:31.270> that<00:02:32.820> all<00:02:33.820> right<00:02:33.910> I'm

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
read in the end of that all right I'm

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.330 
read in the end of that all right I'm
going<00:02:34.060> to<00:02:34.150> pop<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.420> back<00:02:34.630> off<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.980> battery's

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
going to pop the back off the battery's

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.770 
going to pop the back off the battery's
gonna<00:02:36.520> come<00:02:36.760> doesn't<00:02:37.450> come<00:02:37.540> with<00:02:37.720> any

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
gonna come doesn't come with any

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.900 
gonna come doesn't come with any
batteries<00:02:38.320> so<00:02:38.470> you<00:02:38.560> gotta<00:02:38.680> put<00:02:39.430> three<00:02:39.610> double

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
batteries so you gotta put three double

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.310 
batteries so you gotta put three double
a's<00:02:40.030> in<00:02:40.590> pretty<00:02:41.590> simple<00:02:42.570> back<00:02:43.570> just<00:02:43.900> snap<00:02:44.140> so

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
a's in pretty simple back just snap so

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.730 
a's in pretty simple back just snap so
on<00:02:44.820> doesn't<00:02:45.820> slide<00:02:46.060> in<00:02:46.240> like<00:02:46.270> normal<00:02:46.740> yes

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
on doesn't slide in like normal yes

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:48.960 
on doesn't slide in like normal yes
you're<00:02:47.920> going<00:02:48.040> to<00:02:48.100> drop<00:02:48.280> it<00:02:48.490> on<00:02:48.610> and<00:02:48.790> clip<00:02:48.940> it

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
you're going to drop it on and clip it

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.820 
you're going to drop it on and clip it
in<00:02:49.180> and<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:51.370> back<00:02:51.730> has<00:02:52.260> an<00:02:53.260> awesome<00:02:53.410> dimmer

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
in and the back has an awesome dimmer

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.920 
in and the back has an awesome dimmer
switch<00:02:54.130> I've<00:02:54.790> really<00:02:55.090> pretty<00:02:55.630> pleased<00:02:55.900> with

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
switch I've really pretty pleased with

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.980 
switch I've really pretty pleased with
that<00:02:56.080> so<00:02:56.950> you<00:02:57.010> go<00:02:57.160> all<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.430> way<00:02:57.460> on<00:02:57.730> and<00:02:58.060> almost

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
that so you go all the way on and almost

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.930 
that so you go all the way on and almost
all<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.320> way<00:02:59.350> off<00:02:59.620> as<00:03:00.370> you<00:03:00.490> can<00:03:00.640> see<00:03:00.790> the

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
all the way off as you can see the

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.270 
all the way off as you can see the
difference<00:03:01.270> in<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.450> light<00:03:01.950> and<00:03:02.950> this<00:03:03.100> is

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
difference in the light and this is

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.360 
difference in the light and this is
almost<00:03:03.490> this<00:03:03.910> is<00:03:04.060> down<00:03:04.270> as<00:03:04.630> far<00:03:04.840> as<00:03:04.960> it<00:03:05.080> goes

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
almost this is down as far as it goes

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.040 
almost this is down as far as it goes
that's<00:03:06.370> all<00:03:06.850> the<00:03:07.060> way<00:03:07.180> on<00:03:07.360> it's<00:03:07.840> pretty

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
that's all the way on it's pretty

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.860 
that's all the way on it's pretty
intense<00:03:09.090> but<00:03:10.090> you<00:03:10.180> get<00:03:10.270> a<00:03:10.330> lot<00:03:10.360> of<00:03:10.510> control

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
intense but you get a lot of control

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.570 
intense but you get a lot of control
there<00:03:11.080> you're<00:03:11.230> not<00:03:11.290> limited<00:03:11.710> to<00:03:11.800> just<00:03:12.460> one

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
there you're not limited to just one

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.960 
there you're not limited to just one
light<00:03:12.940> intensity<00:03:14.520> outcomes<00:03:15.520> of<00:03:15.670> these<00:03:15.790> two

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
light intensity outcomes of these two

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.150 
light intensity outcomes of these two
filters<00:03:16.240> the<00:03:16.570> first<00:03:16.780> one<00:03:16.960> is<00:03:17.020> a<00:03:17.080> 3200<00:03:17.800> calven

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
filters the first one is a 3200 calven

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.340 
filters the first one is a 3200 calven
filter<00:03:18.240> it<00:03:19.240> just<00:03:19.480> changes<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:19.930> temperature

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
filter it just changes the temperature

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.370 
filter it just changes the temperature
of<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.530> light<00:03:20.710> a<00:03:20.740> little<00:03:20.830> bit<00:03:21.690> probably<00:03:22.690> see<00:03:23.050> a

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
of the light a little bit probably see a

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.630 
of the light a little bit probably see a
little<00:03:23.590> bit<00:03:23.710> of<00:03:23.770> a<00:03:23.890> difference<00:03:24.220> a<00:03:24.310> little<00:03:24.520> bit

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
little bit of a difference a little bit

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.620 
little bit of a difference a little bit
warmer<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:26.440> the<00:03:26.500> other<00:03:26.620> one<00:03:26.860> is<00:03:27.510> those<00:03:28.510> are

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
warmer and the other one is those are

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.090 
warmer and the other one is those are
really<00:03:28.750> have<00:03:28.930> a<00:03:28.960> temperature<00:03:29.350> just<00:03:29.710> says<00:03:29.890> it's

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
really have a temperature just says it's

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:38.580 
really have a temperature just says it's
magenta<00:03:31.770> pseudo<00:03:32.770> to<00:03:33.520> make<00:03:33.670> more<00:03:33.970> fluorescent

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.680 

so<00:03:39.190> you<00:03:39.280> get<00:03:39.370> a<00:03:39.400> lot<00:03:39.489> of<00:03:39.519> flexibility<00:03:40.150> yeah<00:03:40.330> uh

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
so you get a lot of flexibility yeah uh

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.229 
so you get a lot of flexibility yeah uh
put<00:03:41.349> the<00:03:41.379> diffuser<00:03:41.739> back<00:03:42.069> because<00:03:42.879> I<00:03:42.940> probably

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
put the diffuser back because I probably

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.339 
put the diffuser back because I probably
better<00:03:43.680> think<00:03:44.680> you<00:03:44.769> can<00:03:45.160> get<00:03:45.280> different

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
better think you can get different

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.440 
better think you can get different
filters<00:03:47.349> to<00:03:47.500> put<00:03:47.680> over<00:03:47.860> this<00:03:48.069> too<00:03:48.340> or<00:03:49.269> you<00:03:49.330> can

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
filters to put over this too or you can

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.680 
filters to put over this too or you can
get<00:03:50.069> you<00:03:51.069> can<00:03:51.220> sort<00:03:51.430> of<00:03:51.459> make<00:03:51.519> a<00:03:51.640> soft<00:03:51.940> box<00:03:52.300> with

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
get you can sort of make a soft box with

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.479 
get you can sort of make a soft box with
a<00:03:52.720> sheet<00:03:53.080> alright<00:03:53.950> the<00:03:54.040> way<00:03:54.129> I<00:03:54.160> made<00:03:54.340> this

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
a sheet alright the way I made this

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.100 
a sheet alright the way I made this
clamps<00:03:54.849> very<00:03:55.030> simple<00:03:55.420> it's<00:03:55.720> just<00:03:55.870> a<00:03:55.959> two

different<00:05:31.350> things<00:05:31.800> first<00:05:32.730> one<00:05:33.000> is<00:05:33.240> with<00:05:33.720> the

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
different things first one is with the

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.360 
different things first one is with the
light<00:05:36.390> on<00:05:36.600> full<00:05:37.110> intensity<00:05:37.440> so<00:05:38.160> we're<00:05:38.280> going

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
light on full intensity so we're going

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.260 
light on full intensity so we're going
to<00:05:38.460> turn<00:05:38.550> this<00:05:38.700> on<00:05:38.880> and<00:05:38.910> see<00:05:39.090> what<00:05:39.150> a

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
to turn this on and see what a

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.150 
to turn this on and see what a
difference<00:05:39.300> this<00:05:39.660> makes<00:05:39.720> i<00:05:42.919> mean<00:05:43.919> that's<00:05:44.070> a

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
difference this makes i mean that's a

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.970 
difference this makes i mean that's a
that's<00:05:44.790> a<00:05:44.940> pretty<00:05:45.090> good<00:05:45.620> shot<00:05:46.620> right<00:05:46.800> there<00:05:46.830> I

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:46.980 
that's a pretty good shot right there I

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.110 
that's a pretty good shot right there I
wouldn't<00:05:47.280> turn<00:05:47.400> it<00:05:47.550> all<00:05:47.669> the<00:05:47.700> way<00:05:47.760> up<00:05:47.910> it<00:05:48.090> just

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
wouldn't turn it all the way up it just

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.030 
wouldn't turn it all the way up it just
kind<00:05:48.419> of<00:05:48.480> watches<00:05:48.840> it<00:05:48.960> up<00:05:49.080> but<00:05:49.230> if<00:05:49.320> you<00:05:49.350> can

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.040 
kind of watches it up but if you can

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.650 
kind of watches it up but if you can
dial<00:05:50.220> it<00:05:50.370> back<00:05:50.400> get<00:05:50.669> it<00:05:50.730> just<00:05:50.940> right<00:05:51.030> I'm<00:05:51.480> gonna

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
dial it back get it just right I'm gonna

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.659 
dial it back get it just right I'm gonna
throw<00:05:51.900> the<00:05:52.050> diffuser<00:05:52.800> in<00:05:53.010> there<00:05:53.220> you<00:05:53.490> might

throw the diffuser in there you might

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:57.140 
throw the diffuser in there you might

filters<00:06:03.770> first<00:06:04.770> I'm<00:06:04.950> going<00:06:05.010> to<00:06:05.130> try<00:06:05.370> the

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
filters first I'm going to try the

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.440 
filters first I'm going to try the
magenta<00:06:07.340> 3200<00:06:08.340> which<00:06:08.970> is<00:06:09.150> a<00:06:09.180> little<00:06:09.270> bit

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.450 
magenta 3200 which is a little bit

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:14.920 
magenta 3200 which is a little bit
warmer<00:06:09.840> color<00:06:10.790> that's<00:06:11.790> pretty<00:06:12.000> nice

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.020 

I<00:06:15.050> don't<00:06:15.650> we<00:06:15.710> put<00:06:15.889> the<00:06:16.009> magenta<00:06:16.550> filtering

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030 
I don't we put the magenta filtering

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:23.570 
I don't we put the magenta filtering
right<00:06:17.210> now<00:06:17.389> see<00:06:18.020> that<00:06:18.199> makes<00:06:18.380> any<00:06:18.530> difference

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.390 

now<00:06:24.210> the<00:06:24.270> light<00:06:24.539> you<00:06:24.840> can<00:06:24.960> see<00:06:25.169> the<00:06:25.289> light

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
now the light you can see the light

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.399 
now the light you can see the light
right<00:06:26.400> here<00:06:26.460> that's<00:06:27.360> actually<00:06:27.569> not<00:06:27.870> on<00:06:28.110> that's

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:28.409 
right here that's actually not on that's

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:31.850 
right here that's actually not on that's
just<00:06:28.530> reflecting<00:06:29.099> light<00:06:29.340> off<00:06:29.520> my<00:06:30.620> light<00:06:31.620> that

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
just reflecting light off my light that

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.830 
just reflecting light off my light that
set<00:06:32.189> right<00:06:32.460> next<00:06:32.819> to<00:06:32.909> the<00:06:33.030> iphone<00:06:33.389> literally

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 
set right next to the iphone literally

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.179 
set right next to the iphone literally
four<00:06:34.680> inches<00:06:34.919> away<00:06:35.870> so<00:06:36.870> I'm<00:06:37.710> pretty<00:06:37.949> psyched

00:06:38.179 --> 00:06:38.189 
four inches away so I'm pretty psyched

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:40.490 
four inches away so I'm pretty psyched
about<00:06:38.370> that<00:06:38.699> I<00:06:38.729> can<00:06:38.969> you<00:06:39.449> know<00:06:39.509> you<00:06:39.569> can<00:06:39.689> bring

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 
about that I can you know you can bring

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.899 
about that I can you know you can bring
it<00:06:40.590> in<00:06:40.680> different<00:06:40.860> angles<00:06:41.370> if<00:06:41.580> you<00:06:41.669> want<00:06:41.849> to

00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:41.909 
it in different angles if you want to

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:45.740 
it in different angles if you want to
get<00:06:42.000> late<00:06:42.300> at<00:06:43.110> a<00:06:44.240> slightly<00:06:45.240> different<00:06:45.509> angle

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:45.750 
get late at a slightly different angle

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.230 
get late at a slightly different angle
light<00:06:46.199> certain<00:06:46.949> sides<00:06:47.219> of<00:06:47.460> your<00:06:47.580> subject<00:06:48.090> up

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 
light certain sides of your subject up

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.360 
light certain sides of your subject up
more<00:06:48.479> than<00:06:48.629> others<00:06:48.900> I<00:06:49.110> just<00:06:49.949> put<00:06:50.129> it<00:06:50.219> on<00:06:50.250> the

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:50.370 
more than others I just put it on the

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.040 
more than others I just put it on the
other<00:06:50.520> side<00:06:50.759> of<00:06:50.789> the<00:06:51.000> the<00:06:51.539> iphone<00:06:52.610> I'm<00:06:53.610> kind<00:06:53.849> of

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.050 
other side of the the iphone I'm kind of

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.740 
other side of the the iphone I'm kind of
sometimes<00:06:55.050> you<00:06:55.289> can<00:06:55.439> bounce<00:06:55.620> it<00:06:55.889> off<00:06:56.039> the

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:56.750 
sometimes you can bounce it off the

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.809 
sometimes you can bounce it off the
surface<00:06:57.750> onto<00:06:58.379> the<00:06:58.800> subject<00:06:59.280> which<00:06:59.490> is<00:06:59.669> really

00:06:59.809 --> 00:06:59.819 
surface onto the subject which is really

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:03.920 
surface onto the subject which is really
nice<00:07:00.860> crank<00:07:01.860> that<00:07:01.979> up<00:07:02.039> a<00:07:02.219> little<00:07:02.340> bit<00:07:02.930> so

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:03.930 
nice crank that up a little bit so

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:04.969 
nice crank that up a little bit so
there's<00:07:04.050> all<00:07:04.139> kinds<00:07:04.409> of<00:07:04.469> things<00:07:04.530> you<00:07:04.710> can<00:07:04.860> do

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:04.979 
there's all kinds of things you can do

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:07.820 
there's all kinds of things you can do
with<00:07:05.099> this<00:07:05.280> it's<00:07:05.550> pretty<00:07:05.729> sweet<00:07:06.000> setup<00:07:06.830> I'm

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:07.830 
with this it's pretty sweet setup I'm

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:08.990 
with this it's pretty sweet setup I'm
just<00:07:07.919> going<00:07:08.069> to<00:07:08.129> dial<00:07:08.340> that<00:07:08.490> back<00:07:08.550> a<00:07:08.759> little

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000 
just going to dial that back a little

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.330 
just going to dial that back a little
bit<00:07:09.349> that's<00:07:10.349> probably<00:07:10.680> where<00:07:10.800> I<00:07:10.830> keep<00:07:11.069> right

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:11.340 
bit that's probably where I keep right

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.580 
bit that's probably where I keep right
there
