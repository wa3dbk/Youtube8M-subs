00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.560
 okay girls now what I 'm going to do 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.540
 it's a very cumulative version this is 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.419
 where you mix to make a sponge cake 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.490
 sponge cake I do not know how to say yes no 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:17.010
 they saw the video to do this I leave you 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.810
 the link here and if you can not search 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.400
 my videos is the video to do 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.730
 this homemade mix for sponge cake 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.509
 sponge cake as I said with a single 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.250
 egg and I do the marble version iet 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.140
 and if you are recording for me here 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.950
 example well hear some noise or something 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.950
 is it 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.810
 the marble version only that I'm going to use 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:46.500
 is the careless cocoa I do not know how it was read 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.500
 on another page 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:54.630
 is what I'm going to use in this case 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:59.900
 is this as I tell you the written 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:02.450
 it would be a century mark 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.660
 and what am I going to do with the mint I'm going to 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:09.550
 separate I have here another balls another 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:14.030
 another pileup those who say and we are going to 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:16.430
 put half with a spatula or with 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.130
 a spoon of whatever 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.070
 and if you have a little bit of all my life we 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.870
 pay half of the mixture 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.110
 about half in a bag 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.110
 part 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.080
 and what we are going to do is add it in 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.990
 this case I'm going to add I like that 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.970
 it's pretty little thing so I'm going to 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.119
 add a little more than a quarter of 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.119
 Cup 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.900
 ah and a quarter cup 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.470
 we add everything 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:05.210
 and I with the shake we beat it a little 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.210
 more for everything to sink 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.640
 it's like the dust to make the 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.290
 chocolates 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.290
 that kind of thing 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.440
 as far as mixing is from a 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.959
 sponge cake or when they tell you 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.959
 as I already said of a single egg 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.110
 pigs we already want to do something kind 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.380
 for the afternoon and now we do not find 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.730
 nothing good we can do this because 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.730
 does the thing a little 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:56.000
 we grab the source where we are going to put 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.990
 our soil 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.690
 we are not going to cook it 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:06.770
 and and grab them 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.480
 the 2 vols where we had and we're going to 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.530
 add the 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.530
 but mixing 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.819
 and then when we have little 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.840
 we speak the spatulas 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:34.379
 and if he is throwing himself and we put everything 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.379
 what we have left 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.140
 well all mixed 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.600
 if you are chocolate 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.600
 What's up 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.650
 since it is with a verb also 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.269
 so 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.450
 once we have this like this all 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:12.540
 mixed and as it was we put it to the 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:17.180
 oven I have some preheated to 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:20.560
 time to take everything in my life 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.240
 we already have the preheated oven 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.900
 we put it at medium temperature 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.380
 approximately 40 minutes and 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.840
 and ready 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:34.170
 Any questions or questions that this has 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.910
 it's a super easy off I'm told 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.900
 usually put this in the oven and now they go to 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.900
 see the final result 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:44.729
 well come on let's wait more or less 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:46.559
 40 minutes like this we see the final result 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:49.409
 I just took it out of the oven, the soil had 

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:50.909
 put and 12 and now they are 50 so 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:53.459
 you calculate more or less that time 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:56.299
 after doing the knife test 

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:58.319
 that I did it there that comes out clean and 

00:04:56.299 --> 00:05:00.029
 Now I 'm going to unmold it and I'm going to 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:03.209
 show how is this is my version 

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:05.239
 marmolada so good now I turned them 

00:05:03.209 --> 00:05:07.559
 girls this is the final result 

00:05:05.239 --> 00:05:10.799
 It is still warm in the myth alone 

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:13.499
 it looks super rich it has a whiff that 

00:05:10.799 --> 00:05:15.869
 is already there to talk about it but good 

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:17.610
 wait until it cools down any 

00:05:15.869 --> 00:05:19.499
 doubt or query they have leave me a 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.119
 message below if you are seeing 

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:24.419
 the video of the sponge cake with a single 

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:26.719
 egg or are watching the video of how 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:29.219
 make a marbled cake at home 

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:31.099
 I hope you liked it below 

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:33.869
 I leave my facebook page 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:36.629
 I will try to answer all the 

00:05:33.869 --> 00:05:39.750
 comments know excuse but sometimes 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:41.850
 it's difficult with a baby which 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:45.050
 He does not like much that is mother is in 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:48.860
 the computer and I try to 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:52.729
 in my time having him more with him with 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:54.050
 says that the computer obviously like that 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:55.840
 that is to understand that but I'm going to 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.250
 try to answer all messages 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.009
 I hope you liked it as I say it's a 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.599
 quick exit for an afternoon day at the 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:04.690
 which we do not have many ingredients if 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:07.610
 we want to do something rich this is 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.530
 special because it only carries one egg 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.810
 and they are things that we sometimes have at home 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:15.220
 but like them hotel combÃ©s and we 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.220
 we see the next video bay
