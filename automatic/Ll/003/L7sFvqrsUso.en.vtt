00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hi everyone we'll do a little 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.509
 pretty simple 3d drawing so first 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.460
 step I draw a trapeze or in 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.240
 rectangle to crime whose form is 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.240
 not the most important 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.490
 then I will trace the stem of the 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.130
 feather from the inside of the 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.380
 figure and I start well left and 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.660
 you can also go down to 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.400
 middle one just needs to leave room 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.529
 for the man I will also do the 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.630
 outlines of the pen with pencil for 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.390
 do not press too hard so the pen and 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.740
 a little wider towards the side of m 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.050
 then we go into niche contours for 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.740
 that I can use on the black at the end 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.390
 black pencil 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.340
 the important thing is that the line is fine 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.560
 and precise that we go back to give the 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.280
 final shape with pen and do well 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.280
 take out the rod 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.270
 while we finished the anchoring I erase and 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.220
 residues two pencils and I can 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.900
 start filling the internet then 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.270
 with the pencil I will pass on all 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.370
 the edges of the feather avoiding the stem 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.830
 and leaving white all the center of 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.229
 the pub one feels just pop the sides 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.479
 by making small strokes the trunks 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.490
 peeled leaning slightly to the side 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.490
 right in the sense of 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.590
 now I'm just going to sketch the 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:56.270
 area under the pen starting with 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.520
 from the tip 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.520
 we stop a little further to here 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.840
 the stalls to make the texture smooth 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.310
 so the size of the shadow will depend on the 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.900
 height of the most now the 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.310
 last step so the goal is going to be 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.200
 cut out all our purpose so the 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.970
 trapeze and feather be careful because 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.650
 the narrow one and then we have 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.209
 finished our longer so you can 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.500
 always try to make yours if 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.940
 you want to send it to me by install 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.950
 or facebook you can I them 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.630
 will look and I thought to make a 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.209
 probe images that would gather all 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.930
 your feathers that I will send to fez and 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.870
 instagram 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.910
 it will be in the days that follow then 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.890
 if you feel like it do not hesitate in any 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.400
 case thanks for following up and I tell you to 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.400
 very soon 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.870
 1 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.770
 Oh
