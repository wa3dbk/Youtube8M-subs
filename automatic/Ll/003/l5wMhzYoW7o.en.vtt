00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:14.629
 stuffing this review letters poaching 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:16.730
 the first hour was just awesome 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.019
 concerts in the opinion of Putin because it hurts 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.750
 said that awesome raincoat 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.130
 baby they all agreed to vein 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.990
 which is just very universal evil and 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.489
 go on the second part will be cool 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:29.929
 in the end so much so that in the second part of this 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.820
 was sure and there are 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.760
 unconditionally 10 points 100 tv is cool 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.020
 eventually 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.600
 exactly six groups 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.820
 I see immediately the light appears points 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.550
 m of fuel meter at all 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.500
 imported save from first 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.830
 parts there biology teacher architect 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.490
 not spared and so on 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.590
 I'll get all cool 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.750
 eventually 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.190
 more value we will not see 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.760
 the architect won't see the power of anyone 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.360
 see until low characters and 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.600
 companions now party three 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.000
 the character of the 100 plan is the main character of Kokoy 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.930
 a bum who has been leading the government for seven years 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.950
 finally side with either the mages 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.110
 either templar 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.650
 no. 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.760
 and how not tied at all the first second 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.820
 part is not clear why then 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.750
 this post will save 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.820
 where are the sea adjustments 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.990
 the main character from the first part which 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.290
 so expected to meet 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.800
 it is illogical that the article can 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.070
 meet the seas to the number cool it 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.310
 the surest move in my opinion fans 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.640
 how could the first one be stained 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.250
 part 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.330
 kozak kakut bullshit game 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.400
 and this situation between khamovniki papers 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.520
 tiger will mean that all 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.480
 no one 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.550
 headed for magical 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.180
 abilities send them to a circle 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.510
 mages will support self-discredit 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.640
 like in prison and then they can there then he 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.900
 contacted and 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.050
 evil bring to our world in the end lame 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.400
 pekovicha go ships catching them all words 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.830
 so much will be different 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.950
 subject to heavyweight nurbolat 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.119
 This is the most stupid Marik using 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.320
 who communicated 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.310
 bachelor will question vyksa 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.880
 birth suzuki from services circle 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.079
 why can not this be when strengthened someone 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:07.490
 he 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.380
 so must plant total body weight 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.569
 specially 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.330
 criminal code for banks 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.219
 will not glow and generally 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:16.310
 this choice itself 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.050
 between banks of cultural workers 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.050
 considering that without 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:23.779
 playing is very hard considering that 

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:25.680
 final battle final battles very 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.350
 complicated loans that bosses 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.150
 Naturally doctors see the capital 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.980
 happy 1GB 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.860
 In general, this choice does not affect who you are. 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.810
 you will be matches at the end because the car and 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.020
 I brought absolutely everyone 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.680
 somewhere someone separatists in Astana 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.169
 with acts will not remain 

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:43.569
 the customer completely hope them absolutely 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:44.250
 do this 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.379
 in the capital of kenya priests 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.549
 as for the combat power system 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.269
 limbs can be redone 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.449
 dodging beats is even good 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:53.899
 terrain liked what he 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:55.359
 shot did not like this post 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:57.599
 environment of the parish poet reinforcement from 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.289
 universities managed by enemies 

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:00.939
 Of course, if guests are difficult, you can 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:03.229
 need another to start killing everyone would save 

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:05.309
 polis then returned gave backed up 

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:07.139
 which suddenly appears well what 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.849
 Fayera country on average difficulty but 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:11.359
 for some reason I have not received a degree more than once 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.439
 doctor part freeze then 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:14.869
 split the enemies 

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:17.389
 the card also changed the bailiff became easier 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.699
 but there is only one city 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:23.079
 how stressed the start day irkol and his 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:23.949
 surroundings 

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:27.069
 always the same caves 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.079
 such that it looks like a corridor 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.849
 just ash itself is exactly the same 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:33.479
 the very cave in which some 

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:34.559
 passage open 

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:36.559
 and in some places as reports which 

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:38.689
 hike opening closed 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:40.659
 so still irritate the skin taken and because 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:42.119
 that it is the same everywhere 

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:43.889
 Institute get a new girl 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.209
 almost anyway could consciously 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.659
 what is it to developers 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:49.109
 did not have time to finish 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.449
 In principle, don't care what's all the same. 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:53.479
 one move out so hide it of course 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:55.869
 shame mate now armor unnecessary 

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:58.049
 fit well have a watch even with rings 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.209
 straps can not bother general 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:02.829
 driver driving before 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:04.899
 companions are all waiting for their homes 

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:06.010
 and tests 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.269
 our experience as a gift 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.299
 i never began to talk you will see 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.650
 the result was broken then it seems quite 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:12.670
 shepetovka 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.259
 on the one hand it's good 

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:17.139
 in the capital will say quickly here and because 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.009
 what is he supposedly with a character that is 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:20.979
 tortured lot novel you can not 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.279
 romantseva girl and did not understand why 

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:24.139
 seconds 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.360
 article novels in the first half of the game 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.240
 have questions 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.680
 immediately 3 people refuse yes 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.249
 I read the name of those manats 

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:35.539
 in the first part they donâ€™t give anything by the way 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:36.960
 all but 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.870
 Vannikova East Media all the same he 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.190
 just wondering 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.470
 whistling in all respects and really with 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.870
 games 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.830
 what a normal exhibition plus 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:47.969
 photos 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:49.699
 protests 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:51.479
 out ok just that game 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.639
 fascinating delayed 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:55.580
 for example came wrong 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.860
 folk group Via Gra Hope Meacher 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.159
 who seeming requests 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:01.490
 even a lecturer on the floor stock yutkin 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.659
 on what is ready for anything 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:05.559
 reg is very difficult to break even further 

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:06.800
 the best citizens 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.389
 I do not know how the inspector of the Perm region 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:10.969
 put 8 points 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:12.949
 Well, I generally think it will be at least three 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:13.779
 and a half 

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:16.150
 if you haven't played first you can often 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.289
 palkin 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:18.949
 most likely they are normal 100 rub 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:21.169
 continue execution because 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:23.309
 here are other power studios 

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:26.469
 something comes out of the game then they sell 

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:27.509
 want to 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:29.749
 in general, it is worth losing anyway 

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:31.709
 all fans of karachevsky of course 

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:32.979
 eat no illusions 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:35.909
 meanwhile the number created in the message 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:37.689
 in metropolitan areas 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:40.199
 all who have not fought with these companies 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:42.319
 those who played Yuzhno Sakhalinsk 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:43.249
 Thank you all for your attention
