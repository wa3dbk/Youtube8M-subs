00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
all in good fun and they knew it I

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.540 
all in good fun and they knew it I
didn't<00:01:40.020> mean<00:01:40.230> anything<00:01:40.260> by<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.160> was<00:01:41.280> kind

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
didn't mean anything by it it was kind

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.670 
didn't mean anything by it it was kind
of<00:01:41.610> just<00:01:41.790> like<00:01:41.940> you<00:01:42.330> know<00:01:42.870> having<00:01:43.290> fun<00:01:43.320> with

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
of just like you know having fun with

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.350 
of just like you know having fun with
them<00:01:43.830> playing<00:01:44.160> with<00:01:44.310> them<00:01:44.580> stuff<00:01:45.180> like<00:01:45.330> that

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
them playing with them stuff like that

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.170 
them playing with them stuff like that
so<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.290> think<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.950> was<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.100> second<00:01:47.760> I<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:48.060> the

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
so I think it was the second I of the

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.030 
so I think it was the second I of the
retreat<00:01:48.630> or<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:49.020> knows<00:01:49.260> the<00:01:49.590> first<00:01:49.830> night

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040
