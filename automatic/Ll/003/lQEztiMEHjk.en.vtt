00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.670 
dr. Gordy will tell us how she extracts
the<00:00:14.219> egg

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.160 

sometimes<00:00:20.680> you<00:00:21.670> can<00:00:21.850> extract<00:00:22.210> make<00:00:22.540> manually

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
sometimes you can extract make manually

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.930 
sometimes you can extract make manually
and<00:00:24.040> so<00:00:24.250> what<00:00:24.400> you<00:00:24.520> would<00:00:24.640> do<00:00:24.760> in<00:00:24.880> that

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:24.940 
and so what you would do in that

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.630 
and so what you would do in that
situation<00:00:25.060> is<00:00:25.960> your<00:00:26.680> game<00:00:26.860> is<00:00:27.040> right<00:00:27.250> here

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640

have your bird stabilized you can put
just<00:00:31.960> a<00:00:32.230> little<00:00:32.830> bit<00:00:32.980> of<00:00:33.070> pressure<00:00:33.340> in<00:00:33.820> in<00:00:34.120> this

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
just a little bit of pressure in in this

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.080 
just a little bit of pressure in in this
area<00:00:34.630> with<00:00:35.410> your<00:00:35.590> thumbs<00:00:35.890> pushing<00:00:36.400> down<00:00:36.640> and

area with your thumbs pushing down and
your<00:00:37.270> fingers<00:00:37.690> just<00:00:37.930> preventing<00:00:38.440> the<00:00:38.559> egg

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
your fingers just preventing the egg

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.430 
your fingers just preventing the egg
from<00:00:38.920> going<00:00:39.100> from<00:00:39.370> side<00:00:39.550> to<00:00:39.610> side<00:00:39.900> and<00:00:40.900> usually

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
from going from side to side and usually

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.630 
from going from side to side and usually
I<00:00:41.710> will<00:00:42.300> do<00:00:43.300> it<00:00:43.600> for<00:00:43.680> three<00:00:44.680> seconds<00:00:45.220> and<00:00:45.550> then

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
I will do it for three seconds and then

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.660 
I will do it for three seconds and then
release<00:00:46.360> if<00:00:46.870> you<00:00:47.170> keep<00:00:47.680> pressure<00:00:48.040> on<00:00:48.220> it<00:00:48.370> all

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
release if you keep pressure on it all

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.430 
release if you keep pressure on it all
the<00:00:48.850> time<00:00:49.059> that's<00:00:49.300> too<00:00:49.540> painful<00:00:49.989> for<00:00:50.140> the<00:00:50.230> bird

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
the time that's too painful for the bird

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.439 
the time that's too painful for the bird
and<00:00:50.800> that<00:00:50.860> the<00:00:51.550> pain<00:00:51.760> might<00:00:52.000> get<00:00:52.150> too<00:00:52.300> much

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
and that the pain might get too much

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.450 
and that the pain might get too much
work<00:00:52.720> so<00:00:52.989> it's<00:00:53.140> you're<00:00:53.920> like<00:00:54.100> giving<00:00:54.370> them

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
work so it's you're like giving them

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.979 
work so it's you're like giving them
contractions<00:00:55.120> right<00:00:55.239> to<00:00:55.480> do<00:00:55.600> the<00:00:55.750> three

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
contractions right to do the three

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.930 
contractions right to do the three
seconds<00:00:56.559> and<00:00:56.710> then<00:00:56.769> you<00:00:56.980> release<00:00:57.280> three

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
seconds and then you release three

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.970 
seconds and then you release three
seconds<00:00:58.570> and<00:00:58.750> then<00:00:58.809> you<00:00:59.080> release<00:00:59.350> and<00:00:59.650> you

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
seconds and then you release and you

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.490 
seconds and then you release and you
should<00:01:00.280> see<00:01:00.580> progression<00:01:01.330> of<00:01:01.449> that<00:01:01.600> a<00:01:01.660> like<00:01:02.350> it

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
should see progression of that a like it

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.020 
should see progression of that a like it
should<00:01:02.710> drop<00:01:02.949> down<00:01:03.220> you<00:01:03.519> should<00:01:03.699> see<00:01:03.909> this

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
should drop down you should see this

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.790 
should drop down you should see this
little<00:01:04.360> white<00:01:04.510> circle<00:01:05.019> with<00:01:05.230> red<00:01:05.470> point

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
little white circle with red point

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.800 
little white circle with red point
around<00:01:06.280> it<00:01:06.550> and<00:01:06.850> then<00:01:07.120> as<00:01:07.270> you<00:01:07.480> do<00:01:07.630> that

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
around it and then as you do that

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.470 
around it and then as you do that
inflation<00:01:08.620> should<00:01:08.920> open<00:01:09.700> up<00:01:09.820> and<00:01:10.060> allow<00:01:10.150> them

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:10.480 
inflation should open up and allow them

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.660 
inflation should open up and allow them
to<00:01:10.510> be<00:01:10.690> able<00:01:10.960> to<00:01:11.050> come<00:01:11.200> out<00:01:11.320> if<00:01:11.890> it's<00:01:12.040> too<00:01:12.190> dry

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
to be able to come out if it's too dry

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.360 
to be able to come out if it's too dry
then<00:01:13.390> I<00:01:13.720> take<00:01:13.900> a<00:01:13.930> q-tip<00:01:14.320> that's<00:01:14.770> moistened<00:01:15.250> in

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
then I take a q-tip that's moistened in

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.590 
then I take a q-tip that's moistened in
saline<00:01:15.880> and<00:01:16.120> I<00:01:16.210> roll<00:01:16.600> the<00:01:17.229> cloaca<00:01:17.530> back<00:01:18.600> along

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
saline and I roll the cloaca back along

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.600 
saline and I roll the cloaca back along
the<00:01:19.780> egg<00:01:19.960> to<00:01:20.320> allow<00:01:20.530> it<00:01:20.650> to<00:01:20.680> open<00:01:20.950> up<00:01:21.100> often

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
the egg to allow it to open up often

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.210 
the egg to allow it to open up often
once<00:01:22.060> you<00:01:22.240> get<00:01:22.360> it<00:01:22.479> started<00:01:22.600> rolling<00:01:23.140> it<00:01:23.770> just

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
once you get it started rolling it just

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.810 
once you get it started rolling it just
opens<00:01:24.640> and<00:01:24.790> closes<00:01:25.030> and<00:01:25.420> then

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
opens and closes and then

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.910 
opens and closes and then
the<00:01:25.909> way<00:01:26.030> who's<00:01:26.300> your<00:01:26.330> it<00:01:26.600> watch<00:01:27.440> you<00:01:27.710> bird

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
the way who's your it watch you bird

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.170 
the way who's your it watch you bird
when<00:01:28.130> you're<00:01:28.250> doing<00:01:28.490> that<00:01:28.670> with<00:01:28.820> that's<00:01:29.000> quite

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
when you're doing that with that's quite

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.210 
when you're doing that with that's quite
stressful<00:01:29.510> for<00:01:29.870> them<00:01:29.990> and<00:01:30.170> if<00:01:30.260> you<00:01:30.409> see<00:01:30.710> that

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
stressful for them and if you see that

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.800 
stressful for them and if you see that
that<00:01:31.370> bird<00:01:31.610> is<00:01:31.760> kind<00:01:31.970> of<00:01:32.030> close<00:01:32.300> to<00:01:32.510> closing

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
that bird is kind of close to closing

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.810 
that bird is kind of close to closing
their<00:01:33.020> eyes<00:01:33.050> and<00:01:33.470> looking<00:01:34.460> like<00:01:34.640> she's

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
their eyes and looking like she's

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.400 
their eyes and looking like she's
breathing<00:01:35.060> too<00:01:35.360> hard<00:01:35.600> then<00:01:35.840> that<00:01:35.990> might<00:01:36.170> not

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
breathing too hard then that might not

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.109 
breathing too hard then that might not
be

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
be

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.410 
be
the<00:01:37.270> best<00:01:37.509> choice<00:01:38.460> if<00:01:39.460> I<00:01:39.640> can't<00:01:39.909> manually

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
the best choice if I can't manually

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.270 
the best choice if I can't manually
extract<00:01:40.780> me<00:01:40.990> or<00:01:41.290> if<00:01:41.409> I<00:01:41.500> don't<00:01:41.710> think<00:01:41.829> I<00:01:41.979> should

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
extract me or if I don't think I should

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.190 
extract me or if I don't think I should
because<00:01:42.640> I<00:01:42.729> felt<00:01:43.030> in<00:01:43.180> it<00:01:43.329> so<00:01:43.540> big<00:01:43.750> that<00:01:43.960> I<00:01:44.020> don't

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
because I felt in it so big that I don't

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.910 
because I felt in it so big that I don't
think<00:01:44.409> it's<00:01:44.530> possible<00:01:45.210> then<00:01:46.210> the<00:01:46.720> next<00:01:47.500> option

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
think it's possible then the next option

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.279 
think it's possible then the next option
is<00:01:48.070> to<00:01:48.340> collapse<00:01:48.970> the<00:01:49.210> egg<00:01:49.360> and<00:01:49.869> the<00:01:49.960> way<00:01:50.079> to<00:01:50.140> do

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
is to collapse the egg and the way to do

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.410 
is to collapse the egg and the way to do
that<00:01:50.439> is<00:01:50.649> to<00:01:50.740> take<00:01:50.920> fairly<00:01:51.399> large<00:01:51.640> syringe<00:01:52.090> and

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
that is to take fairly large syringe and

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.929 
that is to take fairly large syringe and
a<00:01:52.750> fairly<00:01:53.049> large<00:01:53.170> gauge<00:01:53.799> needle<00:01:54.490> because<00:01:54.700> what

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
a fairly large gauge needle because what

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:56.249 
a fairly large gauge needle because what
you're<00:01:55.090> gonna<00:01:55.210> do<00:01:55.420> is<00:01:55.659> you're<00:01:55.840> gonna<00:01:55.929> pull

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
you're gonna do is you're gonna pull

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.499 
you're gonna do is you're gonna pull
inside<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:57.189> egg<00:01:57.399> and<00:01:57.700> you're<00:01:57.850> gonna<00:01:57.970> suck<00:01:58.299> up

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
inside the egg and you're gonna suck up

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.929 
inside the egg and you're gonna suck up
the<00:01:58.840> contents<00:01:59.380> of<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.649> egg<00:01:59.770> and<00:01:59.950> because<00:02:00.700> egg

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
the contents of the egg and because egg

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:02.850 
the contents of the egg and because egg
white<00:02:01.179> and<00:02:01.299> egg<00:02:01.420> yolk<00:02:01.630> is<00:02:01.810> quite<00:02:02.049> thick<00:02:02.380> you

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
white and egg yolk is quite thick you

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.380 
white and egg yolk is quite thick you
can't<00:02:03.100> choose<00:02:03.369> the<00:02:03.399> teensy<00:02:03.880> little<00:02:03.909> needle

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
can't choose the teensy little needle

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.330 
can't choose the teensy little needle
because<00:02:04.600> it<00:02:04.659> won't<00:02:04.840> go<00:02:04.960> through<00:02:05.200> there<00:02:05.409> so<00:02:06.039> it

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
because it won't go through there so it

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.580 
because it won't go through there so it
may<00:02:06.520> look<00:02:06.549> ugly<00:02:07.090> and<00:02:07.240> big<00:02:07.420> but<00:02:07.810> a<00:02:07.990> big<00:02:08.229> needle

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
may look ugly and big but a big needle

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.309 
may look ugly and big but a big needle
goes<00:02:08.739> in<00:02:09.039> and<00:02:09.340> you<00:02:09.970> suck<00:02:10.269> out<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:10.630> contents<00:02:11.200> of

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
goes in and you suck out the contents of

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.830 
goes in and you suck out the contents of
the<00:02:11.470> egg<00:02:11.620> once<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.489> contents<00:02:13.090> of<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.330> egg<00:02:13.540> are

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
the egg once the contents of the egg are

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.870 
the egg once the contents of the egg are
removed<00:02:14.290> then<00:02:14.799> the<00:02:15.010> shell<00:02:15.310> will<00:02:15.700> usually

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
removed then the shell will usually

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.449 
removed then the shell will usually
collapse<00:02:16.480> quite<00:02:16.959> easily<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:17.860> that<00:02:18.040> makes<00:02:18.280> it

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
collapse quite easily and that makes it

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.610 
collapse quite easily and that makes it
small<00:02:18.819> enough<00:02:19.000> that<00:02:19.360> then<00:02:19.660> it<00:02:19.780> can<00:02:19.810> pass<00:02:20.140> a

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
small enough that then it can pass a

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.530 
small enough that then it can pass a
disadvantage<00:02:21.610> of<00:02:21.760> that<00:02:21.790> is<00:02:22.239> that

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
disadvantage of that is that

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.289 
disadvantage of that is that
occasionally<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.590> sharp<00:02:24.040> edge<00:02:24.220> of<00:02:24.430> cell<00:02:24.700> shell

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
occasionally a sharp edge of cell shell

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.750 
occasionally a sharp edge of cell shell
will<00:02:25.630> cut<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.080> uterus<00:02:26.500> I've<00:02:27.010> never<00:02:27.310> had<00:02:27.580> that

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
will cut the uterus I've never had that

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.509 
will cut the uterus I've never had that
happen<00:02:27.790> but<00:02:28.239> it<00:02:28.390> can<00:02:29.040> usually<00:02:30.040> it<00:02:30.130> doesn't

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
happen but it can usually it doesn't

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.309 
happen but it can usually it doesn't
because<00:02:30.790> of<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.000> shell<00:02:31.269> collapse<00:02:31.690> its<00:02:31.959> end

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
because of the shell collapse its end

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.789 
because of the shell collapse its end
once<00:02:32.830> you've<00:02:33.010> taken<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:34.560> contents<00:02:35.560> of<00:02:35.680> the

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
once you've taken the contents of the

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.640 
once you've taken the contents of the
egg<00:02:35.890> out<00:02:36.130> once<00:02:36.910> you<00:02:37.090> collapse<00:02:37.510> it<00:02:37.840> then<00:02:38.410> I

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
egg out once you collapse it then I

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.410 
egg out once you collapse it then I
don't<00:02:38.890> immediately<00:02:39.459> try<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:39.819> extract<00:02:40.209> it

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
don't immediately try and extract it

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.330 
don't immediately try and extract it
then<00:02:40.599> I<00:02:40.630> give<00:02:40.870> that<00:02:41.049> very<00:02:41.260> calcium<00:02:41.829> and<00:02:41.980> fluids

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
then I give that very calcium and fluids

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.270 
then I give that very calcium and fluids
and<00:02:42.609> let<00:02:42.760> it<00:02:42.880> sit<00:02:43.090> on<00:02:43.209> its<00:02:43.359> own<00:02:43.570> and

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
and let it sit on its own and

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.000 
and let it sit on its own and
they<00:02:44.580> will<00:02:44.730> pass<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.150> on<00:02:45.270> their<00:02:45.450> own<00:02:45.480> it<00:02:46.170> can

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
they will pass it on their own it can

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.920 
they will pass it on their own it can
take<00:02:47.250> anywhere<00:02:47.550> from<00:02:47.700> an<00:02:48.030> hour<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.390> a<00:02:48.600> day<00:02:48.870> to

take anywhere from an hour to a day to

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.430 
take anywhere from an hour to a day to
come<00:02:49.260> out<00:02:49.440> but<00:02:50.010> once<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.520> uterus<00:02:50.910> isn't

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
come out but once the uterus isn't

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.870 
come out but once the uterus isn't
contracting<00:02:52.440> around<00:02:52.890> that<00:02:53.069> big<00:02:53.280> egg<00:02:53.520> all<00:02:53.760> the

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
contracting around that big egg all the

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.120 
contracting around that big egg all the
time<00:02:54.120> then<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.780> bird<00:02:54.930> can<00:02:55.110> relax<00:02:55.410> that<00:02:55.740> that

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
time then the bird can relax that that

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.000 
time then the bird can relax that that
crunched<00:02:56.610> up<00:02:56.730> shell<00:02:57.030> can<00:02:57.630> sit<00:02:57.900> in<00:02:58.020> there<00:02:58.290> for<00:02:58.319> I

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
crunched up shell can sit in there for I

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.660 
crunched up shell can sit in there for I
think<00:02:59.400> my<00:02:59.790> all-time<00:03:00.360> record<00:03:00.840> was<00:03:01.050> a<00:03:01.080> month

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
think my all-time record was a month

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.120 
think my all-time record was a month
before<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:03.030> very<00:03:03.209> plastic<00:03:03.680> but<00:03:04.680> that<00:03:04.860> bird

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
before the very plastic but that bird

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.970 
before the very plastic but that bird
had<00:03:05.430> uterine<00:03:05.970> pathology<00:03:06.630> and<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:07.170> Michelle

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
had uterine pathology and the Michelle

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.760 
had uterine pathology and the Michelle
was<00:03:08.330> way<00:03:09.330> too<00:03:09.390> thick<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:10.020> was<00:03:10.140> like<00:03:10.290> a<00:03:10.319> reptile

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
was way too thick it was like a reptile

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.970 
was way too thick it was like a reptile
egg<00:03:10.980> almost<00:03:11.400> it<00:03:12.120> was<00:03:12.470> anyway<00:03:13.470> came<00:03:13.830> out<00:03:13.950> a

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
egg almost it was anyway came out a

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.490 
egg almost it was anyway came out a
month<00:03:14.130> later<00:03:14.430> but<00:03:15.000> that<00:03:15.330> makes<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.320> bird

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
month later but that makes the bird

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.710 
month later but that makes the bird
stable<00:03:17.160> because<00:03:17.519> they're<00:03:17.640> not<00:03:17.820> contracting

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
stable because they're not contracting

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.100 
stable because they're not contracting
against<00:03:19.560> this<00:03:19.709> angle<00:03:20.130> of<00:03:20.190> tone<00:03:20.489> right<00:03:20.730> so<00:03:21.110> and

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
against this angle of tone right so and

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.229 
against this angle of tone right so and
often<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.680> reason<00:03:23.010> it<00:03:23.130> doesn't<00:03:23.459> come<00:03:23.610> out<00:03:23.760> is

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
often the reason it doesn't come out is

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.750 
often the reason it doesn't come out is
they<00:03:25.050> have<00:03:25.320> pathology<00:03:25.980> somewhere<00:03:26.340> else<00:03:26.459> maybe

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
they have pathology somewhere else maybe

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.820 
they have pathology somewhere else maybe
they<00:03:26.940> have<00:03:27.120> a<00:03:27.150> hernia<00:03:27.600> and<00:03:28.140> their<00:03:28.290> abdominal

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
they have a hernia and their abdominal

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.020 
they have a hernia and their abdominal
muscles<00:03:29.160> aren't<00:03:29.310> strong<00:03:29.400> enough<00:03:29.640> anymore

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
muscles aren't strong enough anymore

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.750 
muscles aren't strong enough anymore
maybe<00:03:31.019> they<00:03:31.290> have<00:03:32.040> been<00:03:32.069> laying<00:03:32.370> too<00:03:32.580> many

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
maybe they have been laying too many

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.640 
maybe they have been laying too many
eggs<00:03:32.940> they<00:03:33.120> don't<00:03:33.420> have<00:03:33.510> enough<00:03:33.690> calcium<00:03:33.930> so

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
eggs they don't have enough calcium so

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.530 
eggs they don't have enough calcium so
if<00:03:34.739> you<00:03:34.860> do<00:03:35.040> your<00:03:35.250> supportive<00:03:35.850> care<00:03:36.150> then

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
if you do your supportive care then

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.330 
if you do your supportive care then
often<00:03:36.959> they<00:03:37.080> can<00:03:37.260> pass<00:03:37.440> it<00:03:37.650> on<00:03:37.769> their<00:03:37.920> own<00:03:38.040> and

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
often they can pass it on their own and
