got going all my stuff getting ready to
be<00:01:18.420> soldered<00:01:18.689> in<00:01:20.600> here's<00:01:21.600> my<00:01:21.780> solder<00:01:21.990> gun

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.230 

there's<00:01:27.159> what<00:01:27.340> it<00:01:27.370> is<00:01:27.610> in<00:01:27.880> case<00:01:28.030> you're

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
there's what it is in case you're

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.820 
there's what it is in case you're
wanting<00:01:28.540> to<00:01:28.600> look<00:01:29.409> it<00:01:29.560> up<00:01:29.760> get<00:01:30.760> one<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:32.500> is<00:01:32.740> an

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
wanting to look it up get one this is an

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.190 
wanting to look it up get one this is an
old<00:01:33.010> old<00:01:33.990> model<00:01:34.990> solder<00:01:35.260> gun<00:01:35.590> it<00:01:36.310> I<00:01:37.080> think<00:01:38.080> the

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
old old model solder gun it I think the

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.740 
old old model solder gun it I think the
older<00:01:38.440> ones<00:01:38.620> work<00:01:38.830> better<00:01:39.010> than<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:39.310> new<00:01:39.550> ones

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
older ones work better than the new ones

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.830 
older ones work better than the new ones
so<00:01:40.890> it's<00:01:41.890> what<00:01:42.159> it<00:01:42.250> is<00:01:42.479> it's<00:01:43.479> got<00:01:43.630> a<00:01:43.690> little

it<00:02:50.950> stay<00:02:51.790> tuned<00:02:52.260> about<00:02:53.260> two<00:02:53.680> and<00:02:53.860> a<00:02:53.920> half<00:02:53.950> hours

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
it stay tuned about two and a half hours

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.990 
it stay tuned about two and a half hours
of<00:02:55.140> working<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:56.829> try<00:02:57.010> to<00:02:57.040> get<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.850> wire

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
of working to try to get the the wire

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.819 
of working to try to get the the wire
soldered<00:02:58.600> in<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:59.140> each<00:02:59.769> heat<00:03:00.280> shrunk<00:03:00.549> to<00:03:01.829> to

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
soldered in and each heat shrunk to to

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:09.330 
soldered in and each heat shrunk to to
the<00:03:02.950> wire<00:03:03.750> here<00:03:04.799> but<00:03:05.799> you<00:03:05.980> can<00:03:06.130> see<00:03:08.160> this<00:03:09.160> is

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
the wire here but you can see this is

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.620 
the wire here but you can see this is
really<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.760> first<00:03:09.940> time<00:03:10.090> that<00:03:10.480> I've<00:03:10.600> ever

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
really the first time that I've ever

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.490 
really the first time that I've ever
done<00:03:10.989> anything<00:03:11.430> like<00:03:12.810> this<00:03:13.810> I<00:03:14.260> mean<00:03:14.350> I've

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
done anything like this I mean I've

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.000 
done anything like this I mean I've
soldered<00:03:14.680> before<00:03:15.220> but<00:03:15.489> I<00:03:15.519> haven't<00:03:15.760> done<00:03:17.010> stuff

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
soldered before but I haven't done stuff

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.940 
soldered before but I haven't done stuff
like<00:03:18.100> this<00:03:19.110> quite<00:03:20.110> so<00:03:20.290> much<00:03:20.410> but<00:03:20.620> it<00:03:20.739> didn't

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
like this quite so much but it didn't

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.350 
like this quite so much but it didn't
get<00:03:21.850> any<00:03:22.000> too<00:03:22.120> bad<00:03:23.400> it's<00:03:24.400> not<00:03:24.610> like<00:03:24.730> a<00:03:24.760> big<00:03:24.970> blob

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
get any too bad it's not like a big blob

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.830 
get any too bad it's not like a big blob
of<00:03:25.739> solder<00:03:27.269> or<00:03:28.269> flux<00:03:28.630> I<00:03:28.870> mean

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.809 

but<00:03:32.500> they're<00:03:32.950> really<00:03:33.760> solid<00:03:34.330> not<00:03:35.200> coming<00:03:35.590> out

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
but they're really solid not coming out

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.430 
but they're really solid not coming out
here's<00:03:36.819> each<00:03:37.060> one<00:03:37.300> of<00:03:37.360> the<00:03:37.540> wires<00:03:38.080> as<00:03:38.290> ice

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
here's each one of the wires as ice

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.630 
here's each one of the wires as ice
altered<00:03:38.860> and<00:03:39.459> C<00:03:39.790> turned<00:03:40.390> out<00:03:40.540> pretty<00:03:40.810> good

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
altered and C turned out pretty good

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:49.470 
altered and C turned out pretty good
that<00:03:42.640> one<00:03:43.560> no<00:03:44.560> huge<00:03:46.230> blobs<00:03:47.910> pretty<00:03:48.910> nice<00:03:49.150> and

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
that one no huge blobs pretty nice and

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.089 
that one no huge blobs pretty nice and
then<00:03:49.989> I<00:03:50.080> just<00:03:50.260> ran<00:03:50.950> along<00:03:51.280> and<00:03:51.640> taped<00:03:52.180> it<00:03:52.330> every

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
then I just ran along and taped it every

00:03:53.099 --> 00:04:03.140 
then I just ran along and taped it every
every<00:03:54.099> so<00:03:54.250> often<00:03:54.459> I<00:03:55.230> keep<00:03:56.230> it<00:03:56.380> together<00:03:57.220> and

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:09.750 

then<00:04:04.150> I<00:04:04.830> just<00:04:05.830> went<00:04:06.040> ahead<00:04:06.190> and<00:04:06.400> I<00:04:08.610> took<00:04:09.610> the

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
then I just went ahead and I took the

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.620 
then I just went ahead and I took the
ends<00:04:10.060> off<00:04:10.180> of<00:04:10.209> these<00:04:11.640> and<00:04:12.640> here<00:04:13.209> is<00:04:13.390> my

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
ends off of these and here is my

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:21.060 
ends off of these and here is my
negative<00:04:15.810> and<00:04:16.810> positive<00:04:18.359> so<00:04:19.919> turned<00:04:20.919> out

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
negative and positive so turned out

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:27.670 
negative and positive so turned out
pretty<00:04:21.340> good

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.969 

pretty<00:04:28.310> happy<00:04:28.520> with<00:04:28.729> it<00:04:29.020> and<00:04:30.020> it<00:04:30.169> now

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
pretty happy with it and it now

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.629 
pretty happy with it and it now
before<00:04:31.460> it<00:04:31.669> was<00:04:31.880> 16<00:04:32.479> foot<00:04:32.810> and<00:04:33.020> now<00:04:33.650> it<00:04:34.100> is<00:04:34.130> 10

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
before it was 16 foot and now it is 10

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.560 
before it was 16 foot and now it is 10
foot<00:04:34.910> so<00:04:36.400> well<00:04:37.400> take<00:04:37.970> that<00:04:38.150> back

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
foot so well take that back

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:47.170 
foot so well take that back
actually<00:04:39.139> I<00:04:39.169> cut<00:04:39.620> I<00:04:40.120> cut<00:04:41.830> about<00:04:45.639> that<00:04:46.639> much<00:04:46.910> off

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
actually I cut I cut about that much off

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.330 
actually I cut I cut about that much off
of<00:04:47.210> it<00:04:47.570> so<00:04:47.870> you<00:04:47.960> can<00:04:48.199> you<00:04:48.710> can<00:04:48.740> kind<00:04:48.979> of<00:04:49.039> see<00:04:49.190> in

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
of it so you can you can kind of see in

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:59.050 
of it so you can you can kind of see in
comparison<00:04:50.889> it's<00:04:51.889> about<00:04:52.389> a<00:04:55.030> foot<00:04:56.030> and<00:04:58.060> five

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
comparison it's about a foot and five

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.670 
comparison it's about a foot and five
inches<00:04:59.479> something<00:04:59.840> like<00:04:59.930> that<00:05:00.199> made<00:05:00.380> foot<00:05:00.620> in

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
inches something like that made foot in

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.170 
inches something like that made foot in
half<00:05:00.860> a<00:05:01.160> little<00:05:01.600> under<00:05:03.580> I'll<00:05:04.580> cut<00:05:04.820> that<00:05:04.970> off

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
half a little under I'll cut that off

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.480 
half a little under I'll cut that off
there<00:05:05.449> so<00:05:05.690> it's<00:05:05.930> it's<00:05:06.380> around<00:05:06.650> 9<00:05:06.800> something

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
there so it's it's around 9 something

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.279 
there so it's it's around 9 something
foot<00:05:07.729> right<00:05:08.000> now<00:05:08.180> these<00:05:08.840> are<00:05:09.050> extra<00:05:09.380> wires<00:05:09.669> to

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:11.289 
foot right now these are extra wires to

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:17.200 
foot right now these are extra wires to
to<00:05:12.430> connect<00:05:13.720> all<00:05:14.720> these<00:05:14.990> little<00:05:15.199> pieces<00:05:16.210> off

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
to connect all these little pieces off

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:25.359 
to connect all these little pieces off
of<00:05:17.720> this<00:05:20.440> okay<00:05:21.440> so

00:05:25.359 --> 00:05:25.369 

00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:31.959 

we'll<00:05:25.789> start<00:05:25.999> hooking<00:05:26.149> up<00:05:26.419> this<00:05:27.789> and<00:05:30.969> I'll

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:31.969 
we'll start hooking up this and I'll

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:33.819 
we'll start hooking up this and I'll
show<00:05:32.359> you<00:05:32.389> what<00:05:32.749> that<00:05:32.929> looks<00:05:33.169> like<00:05:33.259> whenever<00:05:33.589> I

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:33.829 
show you what that looks like whenever I

00:05:33.829 --> 00:05:37.569 
show you what that looks like whenever I
get<00:05:33.889> that<00:05:34.129> hooked<00:05:34.369> up<00:05:34.579> I'm<00:05:36.309> going<00:05:37.309> to<00:05:37.369> think

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:37.579 
get that hooked up I'm going to think

00:05:37.579 --> 00:05:39.249 
get that hooked up I'm going to think
about<00:05:37.699> a<00:05:37.849> little<00:05:38.059> bit<00:05:38.269> more<00:05:38.479> I'm<00:05:38.749> not<00:05:38.959> sure<00:05:39.139> if

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:39.259 
about a little bit more I'm not sure if

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:42.839 
about a little bit more I'm not sure if
I'm<00:05:39.349> going<00:05:39.649> to<00:05:39.799> hook<00:05:40.249> this<00:05:40.429> up<00:05:40.609> right<00:05:40.909> now<00:05:41.649> I

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:42.849 
I'm going to hook this up right now I

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:46.899 
I'm going to hook this up right now I
may<00:05:43.849> wait<00:05:44.059> until<00:05:44.089> I<00:05:44.359> put<00:05:44.659> this<00:05:44.809> wire<00:05:45.699> back<00:05:46.699> in

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:46.909 
may wait until I put this wire back in

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:49.329 
may wait until I put this wire back in
the<00:05:46.999> boat<00:05:47.179> and<00:05:47.419> then<00:05:48.079> solder<00:05:48.739> it<00:05:48.949> back<00:05:49.129> into

00:05:49.329 --> 00:05:49.339 
the boat and then solder it back into

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:53.799 
the boat and then solder it back into
place<00:05:51.759> so<00:05:52.759> that<00:05:52.789> way<00:05:53.089> I<00:05:53.119> don't<00:05:53.299> have<00:05:53.479> to<00:05:53.599> worry

place so that way I don't have to worry

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:55.899 
place so that way I don't have to worry
about<00:05:53.979> getting<00:05:54.979> all<00:05:55.039> that<00:05:55.189> junk<00:05:55.459> through<00:05:55.759> that
