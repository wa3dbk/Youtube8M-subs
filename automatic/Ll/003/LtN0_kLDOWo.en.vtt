taking off a number of parts I guess
probably<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.320> easiest<00:00:22.740> parts<00:00:23.189> at<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.400> moment

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779

the Kaua'i yet if I want to make it into

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.139 
the Kaua'i yet if I want to make it into
a<00:00:40.500> bobber<00:00:40.890> then<00:00:41.219> I'm<00:00:41.370> not<00:00:41.520> going<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.940> need<00:00:42.120> all

off and start working on a few things to

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.700

order I've created envelopes with all
the<00:00:53.340> different<00:00:53.520> screws<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.690> bolts<00:00:55.649> for<00:00:56.129> each

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
the different screws and bolts for each

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.540 
the different screws and bolts for each
part<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.660> motorcycle<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.309> course

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
part of the motorcycle and of course

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.389 
part of the motorcycle and of course
taken<00:00:59.910> off<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.149> seat

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.109

I think this model would make a great
bobber<00:01:16.100> to<00:01:16.610> be<00:01:16.730> honest<00:01:17.380> it<00:01:18.380> has<00:01:18.590> the<00:01:18.860> perfect

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
bobber to be honest it has the perfect

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.600 
bobber to be honest it has the perfect
looks<00:01:19.610> to<00:01:19.790> make<00:01:19.940> one<00:01:20.150> and<00:01:20.980> you<00:01:21.980> know<00:01:22.100> as<00:01:22.340> in<00:01:22.490> all

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
looks to make one and you know as in all

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.490 
looks to make one and you know as in all
videos<00:01:23.030> when<00:01:23.270> you<00:01:23.360> start<00:01:23.630> tearing<00:01:24.050> a

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
videos when you start tearing a

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.360 
videos when you start tearing a
motorcycle<00:01:25.370> apart<00:01:25.700> it<00:01:25.880> looks<00:01:26.060> better<00:01:26.270> with

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
motorcycle apart it looks better with

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.900 
motorcycle apart it looks better with
any<00:01:28.370> of<00:01:28.550> the<00:01:28.640> parts<00:01:28.910> taken<00:01:29.270> off<00:01:29.390> I<00:01:30.670> did<00:01:31.670> keep

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
all the electrical in place because I

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.460 
all the electrical in place because I
want<00:01:35.060> to<00:01:35.180> start<00:01:35.450> it<00:01:35.630> before<00:01:35.990> I<00:01:36.020> start<00:01:36.320> on<00:01:36.440> the

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
want to start it before I start on the

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.469 
want to start it before I start on the
engine<00:01:36.830> just<00:01:37.430> to<00:01:37.610> make<00:01:37.760> sure<00:01:37.910> that<00:01:38.120> it's<00:01:38.270> run

electrically<00:01:45.310> related<00:01:46.310> and<00:01:46.930> start<00:01:47.930> working

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
electrically related and start working

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.830 
electrically related and start working
on<00:01:48.410> those<00:01:48.560> things<00:01:48.619> and<00:01:49.340> in<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.119> meantime<00:01:50.330> if<00:01:50.720> I

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
do take something off like for example

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.770 
do take something off like for example
the<00:01:52.880> rear<00:01:53.979> head<00:01:54.979> or<00:01:55.369> sorry<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:55.729> rear<00:01:55.910> lamp<00:01:56.180> I'm

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
the rear head or sorry the rear lamp I'm

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.490 
the rear head or sorry the rear lamp I'm
going<00:01:57.140> to<00:01:57.290> mark<00:01:58.070> all<00:01:58.250> the<00:01:59.290> electrical<00:02:00.290> so<00:02:00.470> I

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
going to mark all the electrical so I

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.190 
going to mark all the electrical so I
know<00:02:00.619> where<00:02:00.979> it<00:02:01.070> goes<00:02:01.250> and<00:02:01.840> so<00:02:02.840> I<00:02:02.869> don't<00:02:02.960> make

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
know where it goes and so I don't make

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.719 
know where it goes and so I don't make
any<00:02:03.440> mistakes<00:02:03.950> when<00:02:04.100> I<00:02:04.160> put<00:02:04.369> it<00:02:04.460> back<00:02:04.490> together

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
any mistakes when I put it back together

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.110 
any mistakes when I put it back together
again<00:02:04.940> so<00:02:05.530> it's<00:02:06.530> still<00:02:06.710> a<00:02:06.740> long<00:02:07.100> ways<00:02:07.460> but<00:02:08.950> yeah

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.120 
again so it's still a long ways but yeah

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.510
