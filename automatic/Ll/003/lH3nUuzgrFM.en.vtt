 pouring white chocolate for

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.949
 where we will use the zest then for 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.879
 decorate 150 grams of white chocolate 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.220
 and 100 grams of candied cherries la 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.000
 Donut preparation is simple 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.979
 Like never before 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.049
 first we will put all the ingredients 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.860
 dry then we will proceed with the 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.860
 liquid ingredients 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:32.180
 who we now mix respectable in everything 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.790
 it grates but also the shock 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.710
 of the orange in alternative you can also 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:41.930
 use a vial of was a 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:44.210
 evil and this is the consistency 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.240
 final of the dough in the meantime that 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.340
 what did I get a mold a 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.270
 donut clearly buttered and 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:57.050
 floured and now we pour ours 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:01.430
 composed inside paying attention 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.710
 maybe not to dirty the boney am 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.320
 leveling the dough a little with one 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.320
 spatula and now we can proceed to 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:14.750
 bake in a preheated oven 180 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:17.300
 degrees for about 30 35 minutes later 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.910
 half an hour of cooking we have removed 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.110
 gently donut from the mold 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.450
 and this is the result we have it 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.880
 left a little warm and then I have it 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.800
 resting on a grid because 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.900
 this is because we will now cover 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.459
 with white chocolate 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.080
 see I have smoke that uses it a 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.170
 microwave however you can melt it if you want 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.870
 safely even in a bain-marie 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.030
 ok now how to make a very simple call 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.930
 I call chocolate irregularly 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.930
 so 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:55.910
 once the chocolate is poured we go to 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.910
 decorate with some candied optimism 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.020
 after which we will cool down 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.130
 to coagulate the chocolate well for 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:07.920
 an hour fridge 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:09.810
 then the dessert is ready to be this 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.550
 it is the donut that I propose for you 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.170
 breakfast on christmas day 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.880
 then of course you can also 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.490
 adapt it to your needs e 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.590
 serve as a dessert dedicated to the end 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.610
 of the Christmas meal to replace the 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.610
 classic panettone pandoro
