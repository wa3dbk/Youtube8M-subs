change to three different regenerative
braking<00:02:24.910> modes<00:02:25.150> and<00:02:25.870> they're<00:02:26.079> all<00:02:26.320> more

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
braking modes and they're all more

definitely<00:02:35.859> feels<00:02:35.980> like<00:02:36.130> you're<00:02:36.340> applying

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:36.609 
definitely feels like you're applying

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.940 
definitely feels like you're applying
the<00:02:36.850> brakes<00:02:37.150> but<00:02:37.480> it's<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.780> car<00:02:38.019> gaining<00:02:38.799> back

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
the brakes but it's the car gaining back

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.890 
the brakes but it's the car gaining back
power<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:39.549> with<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:39.940> range<00:02:40.239> meter<00:02:40.510> you<00:02:40.720> can

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
power and with the range meter you can

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.440 
power and with the range meter you can
see<00:02:41.200> yourself<00:02:41.430> gaining<00:02:42.430> range<00:02:42.700> so<00:02:43.329> it's

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
see yourself gaining range so it's

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.199 
see yourself gaining range so it's
pretty<00:02:43.570> cool<00:02:43.810> it<00:02:44.049> feels<00:02:44.410> like<00:02:44.739> a<00:02:45.010> normal<00:02:45.820> car

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209

with Bosch to supply those you can do a

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.600 
with Bosch to supply those you can do a
full<00:04:27.000> charge<00:04:27.300> and<00:04:27.750> I<00:04:27.930> think<00:04:28.169> it's<00:04:28.340> about<00:04:29.340> four

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
full charge and I think it's about four

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.700 
full charge and I think it's about four
hours<00:04:29.970> which<00:04:30.480> is<00:04:30.630> pretty<00:04:30.690> good

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
hours which is pretty good

now if you just have a regular you know

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.400 
now if you just have a regular you know

with an electric car is the torque

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.690 
with an electric car is the torque
