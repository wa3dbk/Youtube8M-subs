 they are the honorable thing and there 

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:55.309
 its the startup foundation 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.750
 Judge wore mine of the press and that 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.410

 World champion decide 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:29.060
 Absolutely the track would be in 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.020
 a super nice area and there is 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.910
 it actually cut better 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.190
 marathon speed is for me then

 believe that the online competitors 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.020
 and enjoy it in a certain way 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.190
 that's the infrastructure 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:46.910
 complete and always great organized 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.770

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.800
 but watch trained on the 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.660
 and it will certainly be the 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.890
 Competition will confirm that it 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:03.820
