00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
a log that's viable for the shop it

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.500 
a log that's viable for the shop it
might<00:00:55.620> be<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.039> as<00:00:56.160> we<00:00:56.370> open<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:56.850> log<00:00:57.120> up<00:00:57.149> we

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
might be that as we open this log up we

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.599 
might be that as we open this log up we
finance<00:00:58.050> or<00:00:58.260> we<00:00:58.350> find<00:00:58.590> other<00:00:58.800> defects<00:00:59.340> that

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
finance or we find other defects that

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.869 
finance or we find other defects that
tell<00:01:00.359> us<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.629> just<00:01:00.809> kick<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.199> out<00:01:01.289> as<00:01:02.190> firewood

fourth<00:01:45.240> cuts<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:46.170> we're<00:01:46.290> gonna<00:01:46.380> make<00:01:46.649> this

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
fourth cuts and we're gonna make this

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.580 
fourth cuts and we're gonna make this
into<00:01:46.979> a

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
into a

00:01:47.590 --> 00:02:07.200

member

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.660 

well<00:02:07.780> we<00:02:07.930> finished<00:02:08.140> sawing<00:02:08.679> all<00:02:08.890> four<00:02:09.429> sides

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
well we finished sawing all four sides

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.630 
well we finished sawing all four sides
of<00:02:09.820> our<00:02:09.940> log<00:02:10.179> and<00:02:10.890> our<00:02:11.890> timbers<00:02:12.280> ended<00:02:12.550> up

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
of our log and our timbers ended up

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.640 
of our log and our timbers ended up
square<00:02:12.940> we<00:02:13.120> found<00:02:13.420> that<00:02:13.540> our<00:02:13.690> our<00:02:13.930> white<00:02:14.500> ash

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
square we found that our our white ash

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.040 
square we found that our our white ash
defect<00:02:15.280> or<00:02:15.520> we<00:02:15.820> found<00:02:16.060> that<00:02:16.180> our<00:02:16.330> defect<00:02:16.810> that

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
defect or we found that our defect that

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.870 
defect or we found that our defect that
we<00:02:17.380> saw<00:02:17.560> initially<00:02:17.830> on<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.250> outside<00:02:18.610> face

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
we saw initially on the outside face

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.060 
we saw initially on the outside face
that<00:02:19.060> we<00:02:19.150> tried<00:02:19.330> to<00:02:19.450> remove<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:19.990> kept<00:02:20.800> going

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
that we tried to remove it kept going

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.100 
that we tried to remove it kept going
all<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.370> way<00:02:21.400> through<00:02:21.490> the<00:02:21.790> log<00:02:21.970> so<00:02:22.780> out<00:02:22.930> of<00:02:22.960> a

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
all the way through the log so out of a

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.020 
all the way through the log so out of a
12<00:02:23.410> foot<00:02:23.680> timber<00:02:24.100> what<00:02:24.400> we've<00:02:24.550> ended<00:02:24.850> up<00:02:24.970> with

12 foot timber what we've ended up with

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.800 
12 foot timber what we've ended up with
is<00:02:25.209> a<00:02:25.390> can't<00:02:25.750> that's<00:02:26.110> 8<00:02:26.410> by<00:02:26.590> 10<00:02:27.360> we<00:02:28.360> didn't<00:02:28.690> have

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
is a can't that's 8 by 10 we didn't have

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.810 
is a can't that's 8 by 10 we didn't have
any<00:02:28.990> boards<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:29.470> take<00:02:29.650> off<00:02:29.860> of<00:02:30.070> it<00:02:30.190> there

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
any boards to take off of it there

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.310 
any boards to take off of it there

wasn't really any grade lumber or
anything<00:02:32.709> that<00:02:32.830> we<00:02:32.920> could<00:02:33.040> really<00:02:33.310> get<00:02:33.640> around

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
anything that we could really get around

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
the circumference of this camp but we do

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.420 
the circumference of this camp but we do
have<00:02:36.580> an<00:02:36.970> 8<00:02:37.090> by<00:02:37.270> 10<00:02:37.300> 8<00:02:37.810> feet<00:02:38.050> long<00:02:38.260> that<00:02:39.130> would

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
have an 8 by 10 8 feet long that would

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.630 
have an 8 by 10 8 feet long that would

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
for NHL a grading rules so if we needed

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.550 
for NHL a grading rules so if we needed
to<00:02:45.790> grade<00:02:46.030> this<00:02:46.239> timber<00:02:46.540> for<00:02:46.840> a<00:02:46.870> project<00:02:47.140> it

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
to grade this timber for a project it

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.650 
to grade this timber for a project it
would<00:02:47.709> fall<00:02:48.010> under<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.880> kind<00:02:49.150> of<00:02:49.209> structural

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
would fall under the kind of structural

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.570 
would fall under the kind of structural
grading<00:02:50.080> rules<00:02:50.290> that<00:02:50.470> we<00:02:50.590> use<00:02:50.620> typically<00:02:51.370> for

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
grading rules that we use typically for

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.880 
grading rules that we use typically for
our<00:02:51.730> frame<00:02:52.000> components<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:53.320> last<00:02:53.500> couple

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
our frame components the last couple

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.620 
our frame components the last couple
feet<00:02:54.100> of<00:02:54.220> this<00:02:54.340> there<00:02:54.850> isn't<00:02:55.090> really<00:02:55.180> much<00:02:55.330> we

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
feet of this there isn't really much we

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.690 
feet of this there isn't really much we
can<00:02:55.780> do<00:02:55.930> with<00:02:56.080> it<00:02:56.260> it's<00:02:56.650> not<00:02:56.739> really<00:02:57.250> even<00:02:57.400> long

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
can do with it it's not really even long

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.030 
can do with it it's not really even long
enough<00:02:57.730> to<00:02:58.090> get<00:02:58.209> Brahe<00:02:58.480> stock<00:02:58.810> out<00:02:59.050> of<00:02:59.080> unless

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
enough to get Brahe stock out of unless

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.810 
enough to get Brahe stock out of unless
we<00:03:00.310> were<00:03:00.459> to<00:03:00.930> use<00:03:01.930> some<00:03:02.200> short<00:03:02.470> braces<00:03:02.950> so<00:03:03.640> in

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
we were to use some short braces so in

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.670 
we were to use some short braces so in
essence<00:03:04.150> this<00:03:04.300> is<00:03:04.360> really<00:03:04.750> firewood<00:03:05.230> or<00:03:05.470> some

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
essence this is really firewood or some

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.190 
essence this is really firewood or some
other<00:03:05.830> decorative<00:03:06.400> piece<00:03:06.670> so<00:03:07.600> the<00:03:07.690> last<00:03:07.870> two

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
other decorative piece so the last two

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.810 
other decorative piece so the last two
and<00:03:08.350> a<00:03:08.380> half<00:03:08.530> three<00:03:08.739> feet<00:03:09.010> of<00:03:09.130> this<00:03:09.220> timber<00:03:09.670> is

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
and a half three feet of this timber is

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.120 
and a half three feet of this timber is
is<00:03:10.270> essentially<00:03:10.780> junk<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.230> first<00:03:11.470> 8<00:03:11.650> feet<00:03:11.920> is

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
is essentially junk the first 8 feet is

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.000 
is essentially junk the first 8 feet is
pretty<00:03:12.400> good<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.900> bug<00:03:14.110> damage<00:03:14.350> wasn't<00:03:14.860> too

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
pretty good the bug damage wasn't too

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.670 
pretty good the bug damage wasn't too
bad<00:03:15.239> we're<00:03:16.239> probably<00:03:16.480> going<00:03:16.870> to<00:03:16.989> saw<00:03:17.200> this<00:03:17.440> one

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
bad we're probably going to saw this one

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.229 
bad we're probably going to saw this one
more<00:03:17.860> time<00:03:18.130> maybe<00:03:18.430> just<00:03:18.730> to<00:03:18.820> take<00:03:19.000> a<00:03:19.030> little

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
more time maybe just to take a little

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.150 
more time maybe just to take a little
bit<00:03:19.420> of<00:03:19.480> Wayne<00:03:19.750> off<00:03:19.989> right<00:03:20.680> now<00:03:20.860> it's

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
bit of Wayne off right now it's

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.630 
bit of Wayne off right now it's
finishing<00:03:21.580> at<00:03:21.910> 7<00:03:22.810> and<00:03:22.930> a<00:03:22.989> half<00:03:23.140> by<00:03:23.380> 10<00:03:23.709> we<00:03:24.459> could

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
finishing at 7 and a half by 10 we could

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.490 
finishing at 7 and a half by 10 we could
take<00:03:24.850> 3/8<00:03:25.390> off<00:03:25.600> of<00:03:25.810> this<00:03:25.900> top<00:03:26.170> side<00:03:26.470> and

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
take 3/8 off of this top side and

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.259 
take 3/8 off of this top side and
eliminate<00:03:27.070> this<00:03:27.220> last<00:03:27.519> little<00:03:27.790> bit<00:03:27.910> of<00:03:28.090> Wayne

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
eliminate this last little bit of Wayne

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.680 
eliminate this last little bit of Wayne
before<00:03:28.510> we<00:03:28.750> run<00:03:28.930> it<00:03:29.049> through<00:03:29.080> the<00:03:29.290> whining
