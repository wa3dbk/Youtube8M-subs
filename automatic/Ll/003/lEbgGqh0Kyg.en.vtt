00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
a quick and easy method to draw 3d

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.580 
a quick and easy method to draw 3d
shapes<00:00:14.839> first<00:00:15.839> we<00:00:16.350> will<00:00:16.470> draw<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.770> cube

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
shapes first we will draw a cube

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.870 
shapes first we will draw a cube
everyone<00:00:19.590> please<00:00:19.890> get<00:00:20.100> out<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.250> piece<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:20.699> paper

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
everyone please get out a piece of paper

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.620 
everyone please get out a piece of paper
and<00:00:21.090> pen<00:00:21.590> the<00:00:22.590> first<00:00:22.859> step<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.420> to<00:00:24.420> draw<00:00:24.539> a

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
and pen the first step is to draw a

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.310 
and pen the first step is to draw a
square<00:00:25.880> so<00:00:26.880> everyone<00:00:27.240> draw<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.480> nice<00:00:27.720> even

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
square so everyone draw a nice even

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.790 
square so everyone draw a nice even
square<00:00:31.009> just<00:00:32.009> like<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.870> then<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:34.559> want<00:00:34.770> to

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
square just like that then you want to

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.620 
square just like that then you want to
draw<00:00:34.980> another<00:00:35.219> square<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.790> exactly<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.329> same

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
draw another square of exactly the same

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.420 
draw another square of exactly the same
size<00:00:37.050> but<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.890> draw<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.250> slightly

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
size but you draw it slightly

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.119 
size but you draw it slightly
overlapping<00:00:39.300> on<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.899> top<00:00:40.170> right<00:00:40.590> part<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:41.010> the

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
overlapping on the top right part of the

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:52.850 
overlapping on the top right part of the
square<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:42.450> like<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:51.110> now<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.320> we<00:00:52.410> have<00:00:52.590> two

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
square so like this now that we have two

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.410 
square so like this now that we have two
squares<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.280> are<00:00:53.460> exactly<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.910> same<00:00:54.120> and

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
squares that are exactly the same and

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.840 
squares that are exactly the same and
are<00:00:54.809> slightly<00:00:55.320> overlapping<00:00:55.710> we<00:00:56.430> simply

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
are slightly overlapping we simply

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.939 
are slightly overlapping we simply
connect<00:00:57.270> each<00:00:57.510> corner<00:00:58.020> with<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.410> same<00:00:58.649> other

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
connect each corner with the same other

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.590 
connect each corner with the same other
corner<00:00:59.430> so<00:01:00.239> for<00:01:00.570> example<00:01:01.020> we<00:01:01.559> connect<00:01:01.920> the

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
corner so for example we connect the

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.320 
corner so for example we connect the
bottom-left<00:01:03.600> corner<00:01:04.700> with<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.820> bottom-left

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.230 
with the top-right corner the other
Square<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.619> there<00:01:25.619> we<00:01:25.830> have<00:01:26.009> our<00:01:26.040> cube<00:01:29.240> the

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
Square and there we have our cube the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.899 
Square and there we have our cube the
second<00:01:30.630> 3d<00:01:30.840> shape<00:01:31.140> we<00:01:31.320> will<00:01:31.470> draw<00:01:31.729> will<00:01:32.729> be<00:01:32.880> a

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
second 3d shape we will draw will be a

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.340 
second 3d shape we will draw will be a
triangular<00:01:33.720> prism<00:01:35.000> to<00:01:36.000> draw<00:01:36.180> this<00:01:36.420> we<00:01:37.140> do<00:01:37.229> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
triangular prism to draw this we do the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.080 
triangular prism to draw this we do the
same<00:01:37.530> as<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.710> square<00:01:38.070> but<00:01:38.340> instead<00:01:38.670> we<00:01:38.820> draw<00:01:39.060> a

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
same as a square but instead we draw a

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:48.800 
same as a square but instead we draw a
triangle<00:01:45.890> once<00:01:46.890> we<00:01:47.009> have<00:01:47.159> our<00:01:47.310> triangle<00:01:47.810> we

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
triangle once we have our triangle we

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.840 
triangle once we have our triangle we
want<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.079> draw<00:01:49.290> another<00:01:49.530> triangle<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.430> exactly

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
want to draw another triangle of exactly

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.719 
want to draw another triangle of exactly
the<00:01:50.970> same<00:01:51.470> near<00:01:52.470> over<00:01:53.040> laughing<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.399> little<00:01:53.610> bit

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
the same near over laughing a little bit

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.530 
the same near over laughing a little bit
on<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.000> top<00:01:54.270> right<00:01:54.659> part<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.439> triangle<00:01:55.860> so

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
on the top right part of the triangle so

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:03.980 
on the top right part of the triangle so
like<00:01:57.540> this<00:02:01.040> we<00:02:02.040> want<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.310> make<00:02:02.460> sure<00:02:02.990> that

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
like this we want to make sure that

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.029 
like this we want to make sure that
these<00:02:04.229> two<00:02:04.290> lines<00:02:06.500> have<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.619> exact<00:02:07.950> same

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
these two lines have the exact same

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.270 
these two lines have the exact same
angle<00:02:08.640> like<00:02:08.819> this<00:02:08.849> as<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.750> can<00:02:09.899> see

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
angle like this as you can see

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.949 
angle like this as you can see
right<00:02:11.370> next<00:02:11.760> step<00:02:11.910> is<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.390> connect<00:02:12.660> all<00:02:12.840> the
