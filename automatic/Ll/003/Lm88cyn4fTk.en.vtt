 communication I will not say the channel 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.360
 although I have to say that that channel is 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.489
 It is totally telebasura but good they have 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.280
 put a story in which they blame 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.140
 again again more of the video games of 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.049
 the student violence of violence 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.940
 of gender of AIDS cancer blame 

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:53.949
 always of everything and the truth that I 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.930
 it seems very shameful then I have 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.760
 come to show you the supposed game in 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.309
 his position as so wild that both 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.799
 they complain and well then directly 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.479
 wants to teach us that what brutality 

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:06.340
 bad that bad everything they are doing 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.799
 with the video games wii that hands or 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.810
 video games for him for kids to 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.100
 education and other not a video game 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.140
 that has cost me half an hour 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.670
 find it after knowing how to 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.610
 he called imaginations they said in him 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.200
 in the interview the interview that was a 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.530
 game that was totally within reach 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.759
 of children who could play it without 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.530
 No problem and it has cost me 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.750
 half of finding it knowing the name 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.159
 well what is said is a game that does not 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.049
 we can consider not even the game 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.430
 because basically it's I'm not going to put 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.039
 the sound is worth the sound 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.560
 because we have a very ugly song 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:42.320
 thing is it's a game let's see the 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.330
 games just to not start another 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.310
 time is that you have a game is the thing is 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.789
 one one thing we will 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.830
 select some object from the 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.509
 room or class of whatever and 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.330
 we have to attack the teacher with it 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:59.420
 it's just the psoe worth the thing is 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.060
 that in this interview they were 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.459
 commenting on or is that the child sees the 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.159
 rage the fury that has hits the 

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:10.100
 teacher without any remorse 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:12.769
 then the children are also going to 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.350
 they will repeat they will imitate him and this is 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.930
 very very bad not then 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.700
 is always sorry to apologize 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.980
 video game of something always have to 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.440
 get a shitty news of any 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.190
 medium and me this really fucks me the 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.920
 true because I've been playing since 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.530
 I was five years old and they told me there 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.180
 I have stuck my teacher that never 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.830
 that I never dared to raise from the 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.660
 hand a teacher of mine for playing 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.850
 videogames the truth is that it is 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.640
 embarrassment is a shame that someone 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.160
 think that doing that really a 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.540
 child is going to hit the teacher 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.220
 that a teacher hits you is simply 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.450
 a brainless man without education because his 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.240
 the parents have not given 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.610
 that's my opinion then not good as 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.380
 you are seeing is nonsense or is a 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.020
 Fucking game is a flash animation 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:03.650
 of shit that does not work even for 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.300
 call it game and put it to put 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.470
 all games within the same bag 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:11.150
 being this a mini flash game of 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.460
 shit you can find in any 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.370
 web bothers me a lot so I do not 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.720
 I have around here with this thing if 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.270
 you want, I'll even leave you 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.140
 in the direction where you can play it 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.300
 because I do not care 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.880
 and he's going to touch a compressor 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.650

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.890

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.050
 little moral this and I said I have to 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.250
 do it to comment it because it is not 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.530
 it may be that a means of communication 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.600
 which is also from a channel that is very very 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.780
 dumpster vale is very garbage the 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.030
