it's<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:26.039> little<00:00:26.279> bit<00:00:26.550> secret<00:00:27.090> but<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.330> think<00:00:27.660> you

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
it's a little bit secret but I think you

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.450 
it's a little bit secret but I think you
will<00:00:28.050> like<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.230> more<00:00:28.500> than<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.710> gambling<00:00:29.160> as

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
will like it more than the gambling as

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.310 
will like it more than the gambling as
