00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.560
 read serious people this book 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:10.250
 very same item the third that the beautiful 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.770
 cause it is not the thought that is 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:16.550
 bahia short history when he still 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:19.910
 but I want to read and finally the content of 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.349
 a card that is a book I 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:25.070
 I started to read a lot of people said that it was 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:27.590
 Good but could not mesh Know that 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:33.080
 caught the attention of the favorite book 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:36.370
 because it is so very humorous 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:39.110
 so but it 's nothing funny funny 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.599
 but it's also not romantic at least 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:44.000
 not up to the jury and we do not accept calls 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:46.280
 a lot of attention because you do not know how to 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.010
 story of a guy he's dated 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.560
 19 cards in his life 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:54.500
 the inscribed all the islands way all 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.930
 we know that all the same way and these 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.370
 girlfriends they all broke up with him 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.490
 and never ended any 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.860
 and then it 's the 19th card and 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.660
 resolves to do a cloth theorem of 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.729
 What happens to his life? 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.490
 the book that happens with him and 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:12.650
 It's very interesting is that in a second he 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.229
 was to watch a lot to get to launch 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:18.439
 and she gets a book so the book has 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:20.300
 that captivates me from the beginning and think 

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:22.430
 Is this what people choose the books I 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.529
 I read in the holidays those who have legal books 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.449
 to indicate the beginning here below 

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:29.029
 I love it, you know. 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:31.279
 and if I like the book ngo's review 

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:33.139
 everything more then this 

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:35.830
 a super kiss and until the next video 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:35.830
 bye
