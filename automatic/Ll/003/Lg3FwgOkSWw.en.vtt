00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
gonna try and get as close as possible

gonna try and get as close as possible
so<00:05:34.140> um<00:05:35.210> hopefully<00:05:36.210> this<00:05:36.630> stays<00:05:36.870> in<00:05:37.110> focus<00:05:37.350> on

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
so um hopefully this stays in focus on

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.960 
so um hopefully this stays in focus on
how<00:05:38.970> to<00:05:39.030> tie<00:05:39.390> this<00:05:40.010> so<00:05:41.010> when<00:05:41.220> you<00:05:41.340> go<00:05:41.490> to<00:05:41.520> tie<00:05:41.910> it

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
you just go around once and then you're

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.909 
you just go around once and then you're
gonna<00:05:49.890> pull<00:05:50.190> it<00:05:50.340> kind<00:05:50.610> of<00:05:50.700> tight<00:05:51.710> see<00:05:52.710> I'm

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 
gonna pull it kind of tight see I'm

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:56.300 
gonna pull it kind of tight see I'm
pulling<00:05:53.280> it<00:05:53.550> pretty<00:05:53.790> hard<00:05:54.060> so<00:05:54.770> sometimes<00:05:55.770> when

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
pulling it pretty hard so sometimes when

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.340 
pulling it pretty hard so sometimes when
if<00:05:56.520> you<00:05:56.700> pull<00:05:56.910> it<00:05:56.940> too<00:05:57.060> hard<00:05:57.270> it<00:05:57.750> will<00:05:57.960> break

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
if you pull it too hard it will break

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.560 
if you pull it too hard it will break
and<00:05:58.620> then<00:05:58.919> the<00:05:59.040> beads<00:05:59.250> will<00:05:59.430> go<00:05:59.520> everywhere<00:05:59.669> so

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
and then the beads will go everywhere so

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.930 
and then the beads will go everywhere so
you<00:06:00.660> don't<00:06:00.810> want<00:06:00.960> to<00:06:01.020> pull<00:06:01.169> it<00:06:01.290> too<00:06:01.470> hard<00:06:01.940> okay

you don't want to pull it too hard okay

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.080 
you don't want to pull it too hard okay
so<00:06:03.180> we<00:06:03.510> have<00:06:03.720> our<00:06:03.960> one<00:06:04.169> knot<00:06:04.410> and<00:06:04.940> then<00:06:05.940> you're

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
so we have our one knot and then you're

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.000 
so we have our one knot and then you're
gonna<00:06:06.240> take<00:06:06.630> it<00:06:06.900> and<00:06:07.110> then<00:06:07.410> you're<00:06:07.560> gonna<00:06:07.650> tie

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.010 
gonna take it and then you're gonna tie

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.590 
gonna take it and then you're gonna tie
it<00:06:08.070> like<00:06:08.430> you're<00:06:08.640> tying<00:06:08.850> your<00:06:09.000> shoe<00:06:09.270> again

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 
it like you're tying your shoe again

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.990 
it like you're tying your shoe again
like<00:06:10.050> you're<00:06:10.230> not<00:06:10.550> but<00:06:11.550> then<00:06:11.700> you're<00:06:11.880> gonna

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 
like you're not but then you're gonna

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.840 
like you're not but then you're gonna
take<00:06:12.360> this<00:06:12.510> in<00:06:12.570> and<00:06:12.930> go<00:06:13.140> around<00:06:13.590> one<00:06:14.340> more<00:06:14.580> time

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:14.850 
take this in and go around one more time

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.450 
take this in and go around one more time
okay<00:06:15.510> I<00:06:15.810> think<00:06:16.410> this<00:06:16.560> is<00:06:16.740> actually<00:06:16.950> called<00:06:17.400> the

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
okay I think this is actually called the

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.760 
okay I think this is actually called the
surgeon's<00:06:17.970> knot<00:06:18.180> and<00:06:18.720> then<00:06:19.500> you're<00:06:19.650> gonna

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
surgeon's knot and then you're gonna

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.040 
surgeon's knot and then you're gonna
pull<00:06:20.070> it<00:06:20.250> and<00:06:20.430> then<00:06:21.270> you're<00:06:21.450> gonna<00:06:21.600> do<00:06:21.870> those

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
pull it and then you're gonna do those

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.920 
pull it and then you're gonna do those
two<00:06:22.440> knots<00:06:22.770> again<00:06:23.070> so<00:06:23.790> you<00:06:24.419> just<00:06:24.630> go<00:06:24.810> around

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
two knots again so you just go around

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.080 
two knots again so you just go around
one<00:06:25.410> time<00:06:25.650> like<00:06:25.830> you're<00:06:26.040> tying<00:06:26.250> your<00:06:26.370> shoe<00:06:26.730> and

around one
more<00:06:38.390> time<00:06:38.930> okay<00:06:39.890> so<00:06:39.950> you<00:06:40.250> have<00:06:40.520> a<00:06:40.550> double<00:06:40.880> a

more time okay so you have a double a

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:47.140 
more time okay so you have a double a
double<00:06:44.470> knot<00:06:45.470> it's<00:06:46.310> not<00:06:46.520> really<00:06:46.760> a<00:06:46.790> double

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.150 
double knot it's not really a double

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.690 
double knot it's not really a double
knot<00:06:47.330> but<00:06:47.510> you<00:06:47.660> go<00:06:47.810> through<00:06:47.840> two<00:06:48.290> times<00:06:48.700> okay

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:49.700 
knot but you go through two times okay

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.700 
knot but you go through two times okay
and<00:06:50.000> then<00:06:50.810> you're<00:06:50.930> gonna<00:06:51.050> pull<00:06:51.350> it<00:06:51.380> through

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:51.710

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:55.370 
and that is it and this see this nut

00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:00.460 
and that is it and this see this nut
does<00:06:56.150> not<00:06:56.480> slip<00:06:57.430> now<00:06:58.720> if<00:06:59.720> you<00:06:59.900> do<00:07:00.080> not<00:07:00.200> feel

want to practice or you're just not sure

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.000 
want to practice or you're just not sure
if<00:07:07.640> it<00:07:07.790> will<00:07:07.940> hold<00:07:08.120> then<00:07:08.990> you<00:07:09.170> can<00:07:09.530> put<00:07:09.980> a

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.010 
if it will hold then you can put a

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:11.740 
if it will hold then you can put a
little<00:07:10.280> bit<00:07:10.430> of<00:07:10.640> superglue<00:07:11.120> on<00:07:11.390> here

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:11.750 
little bit of superglue on here

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.330 
little bit of superglue on here
especially<00:07:11.900> if<00:07:12.350> you're<00:07:12.470> beginning<00:07:12.890> to<00:07:13.010> tie

especially if you're beginning to tie

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.610

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:15.620 
your knots just put a little bit of

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:20.050 
your knots just put a little bit of
superglue<00:07:16.220> or<00:07:16.760> no<00:07:17.120> glue<00:07:17.450> will<00:07:17.690> work<00:07:18.370> and<00:07:19.370> then

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:20.060 
superglue or no glue will work and then

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.000 
superglue or no glue will work and then
that<00:07:20.390> way<00:07:20.570> you<00:07:20.600> have<00:07:20.990> some<00:07:21.260> glue<00:07:21.440> I<00:07:21.680> know<00:07:21.830> you

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.010 
that way you have some glue I know you

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.550 
that way you have some glue I know you
can<00:07:22.250> use<00:07:22.400> even<00:07:22.610> Elmer's<00:07:23.120> clear<00:07:23.450> glue<00:07:23.660> just<00:07:24.470> a

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 
can use even Elmer's clear glue just a

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.260 
can use even Elmer's clear glue just a
little<00:07:24.920> bit<00:07:25.070> of<00:07:25.220> glue<00:07:25.400> will<00:07:25.640> help<00:07:25.880> that<00:07:26.060> knot

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:26.270 
little bit of glue will help that knot

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.860 
little bit of glue will help that knot
so<00:07:26.510> it<00:07:26.540> for<00:07:26.720> sure<00:07:26.930> won't<00:07:27.110> come<00:07:27.410> undone<00:07:27.740> and

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:28.870 
so it for sure won't come undone and

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.900 
so it for sure won't come undone and
then<00:07:29.870> if<00:07:30.320> once<00:07:30.860> you<00:07:30.980> feel<00:07:31.250> like<00:07:31.430> you're<00:07:31.610> not<00:07:31.730> as

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.570 
secure you can cut it pretty close to
the<00:07:34.280> knot<00:07:35.560> see<00:07:36.560> that<00:07:36.770> I've<00:07:37.010> cut<00:07:37.250> it<00:07:37.370> pretty

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:37.580 
the knot see that I've cut it pretty

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.110 
the knot see that I've cut it pretty
