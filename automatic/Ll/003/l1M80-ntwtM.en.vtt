00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.390
 I have come to the bicentennial park 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.400
 of vitacura where we are going to know a 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.660
 new way of moving through the 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.090
 city ​​it is a unicycle 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.539
 electrician wanted to know what it is about 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.539
 let's see it 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.329
 It called kiwi and roughly way is 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.739
 an electric wheel that just by climbing 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:30.109
 she promises to move us 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:31.939
 quietly through the city does very 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.890
 little time came to chile and has the 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.170
 Thank you that you spend very little 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.940
 contaminates and according to its manufacturer is 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.900
 designed for anyone who can 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.900
 maintain balance 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.740
 It has a rechargeable lithium-ion battery 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.040
 in a common outlet and what 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:53.620
 better in just 60 minutes allows 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.730
 move a maximum speed of 16 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.570
 kilometers per hour 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.570
 let's see more details 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.450
 this is walking wild josé which has 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.340
 had gyro technology and it's a 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.290
 unicycle that is pretty simple what 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.300
 what you see is what there is 1 swing 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.070
 here and the other here just by pressing 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.410
 He advanced an acceleration and backwards 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.820
 one can brake in training 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.220
 say that about one half hour 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.530
 delay in mastering it is like learning to 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.780
 ride on skates or learn to ski 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.460
 let's do the test let's see what 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.460
 such results in these 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.780
 i 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.000
 I start my training and I recognize that 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.920
 the beginning is not as simple as 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.780
 It's hard to get used to the lack of support 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.760
 for the arms the magic is in the 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.780
 legs has the balance is like 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.780
 learn to walk again 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.120
 and little by little I start to adapt that 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.250
 that yes with the help of a strap 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.560
 Support that comes with the device 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.000
 The truth is that this only serves to 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.000
 feel a little more secure 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.519
 I've been trying for about half an hour 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.310
 occupy the water kiwis are seeing 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:21.140
 results a little bit is not easy 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.239
 At the beginning we believe like everyone once 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.760
 that one reads here knows which one in germany 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.170
 the thing is pretty easy almost to 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.660
 first but I hope there is more here 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.610
 data and be able to be a year my first 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.709
 fear was that the wheel could reach 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.540
 too much speed but the truth is 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.000
 that one regulates it with the inclination of the 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.980
 body for the same at the beginning is almost 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.349
 impossible to fall or at least not in a way 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.480
 attack so my advice is to learn 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.760
 to use it in clear flat places and 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.590
 firm as cement to turns 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.870
 they are also made with the inclination of the 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.450
 body finally I achieved my goal 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.920
 the man dominated the machine now only 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.599
 I can conclude that the sensation of 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.970
 freedom up this electric wheel 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.470
 it is absolute 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.270
 to be an exceptional experience 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.310
 knowing this team changed my way 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.140
 to see the mobilization within the 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.210
 city the pros are many one is 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.010
 they save on parking in benzine in 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.690
 public transport which is very good 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.180
 especially if one thinks the value that 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.550
 has this team the things you found 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.960
 so especially the criticism towards 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.910
 jan city there were more streets 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.920
 where we could move with 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.390
 tranquility with this team the challenge 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.390
 is to know him and joke
