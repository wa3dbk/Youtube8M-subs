select<00:00:28.590> art<00:00:28.980> brush<00:00:31.309> now<00:00:32.309> we're<00:00:33.149> gonna<00:00:33.270> talk

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
select art brush now we're gonna talk

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.209 
select art brush now we're gonna talk
about<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.840> different<00:00:34.230> scale<00:00:34.649> options<00:00:35.100> we

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
about the different scale options we

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.030 
about the different scale options we
have<00:00:35.399> here<00:00:35.430> scale<00:00:36.300> proportionately<00:00:37.040> will

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
have here scale proportionately will

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.160 
have here scale proportionately will
pretty<00:00:38.309> much<00:00:38.399> make<00:00:39.239> sure<00:00:39.420> your<00:00:39.600> brush<00:00:39.870> will

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
pretty much make sure your brush will

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.600 
pretty much make sure your brush will
scale<00:00:40.410> proportionally<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.160> I'll<00:00:41.280> show<00:00:41.460> what

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
scale proportionally and I'll show what

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.850 
scale proportionally and I'll show what
that<00:00:41.640> means<00:00:41.940> right<00:00:42.090> now<00:00:42.680> okay<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.770> I

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
that means right now okay and I

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.950 
that means right now okay and I
proportion<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.940> actual<00:00:45.300> within<00:00:45.750> what<00:00:45.870> it

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
proportion to the actual within what it

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.979 
proportion to the actual within what it
means<00:00:46.110> my<00:00:46.230> proportion<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.250> actual<00:00:47.989> length

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
means my proportion is the actual length

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.840 
means my proportion is the actual length
of<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.350> line<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.739> do<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.190> if<00:00:50.340> this<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.700> gonna

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
of the line you do so if this is gonna

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.560 
of the line you do so if this is gonna
go<00:00:51.590> like<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.730> it's<00:00:53.730> gonna<00:00:53.969> get<00:00:54.360> rid<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.510> that

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
go like this it's gonna get rid of that

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.000 
go like this it's gonna get rid of that
ripple<00:00:54.930> doesn't<00:00:55.199> feel<00:00:55.320> really<00:00:55.559> quick

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
ripple doesn't feel really quick

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.029 
ripple doesn't feel really quick
it's<00:00:57.000> proportionate<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.960> actual<00:00:58.320> size<00:00:58.829> of

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
it's proportionate to the actual size of

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.119 
it's proportionate to the actual size of
the<00:00:59.100> line<00:00:59.280> that<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.579> create<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:00.210> if<00:01:01.010> you<00:01:02.010> make

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
the line that you create so if you make

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.100 
the line that you create so if you make
a<00:01:02.160> smaller<00:01:02.550> line<00:01:03.300> it's<00:01:03.660> gonna<00:01:03.809> always<00:01:03.960> gonna

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
a smaller line it's gonna always gonna

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.740 
a smaller line it's gonna always gonna
be<00:01:04.350> good<00:01:05.129> portion<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:05.939> shape<00:01:06.270> as<00:01:06.510> well

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
be good portion it to that shape as well

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.710 
be good portion it to that shape as well
okay<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:08.340> second<00:01:08.729> one<00:01:08.760> we're<00:01:09.030> gonna<00:01:09.119> focus<00:01:09.390> on

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
okay the second one we're gonna focus on

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.039 
okay the second one we're gonna focus on
here<00:01:10.280> is<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.520> actual<00:01:11.820> scale<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.510> fit<00:01:12.689> stroke

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
here is the actual scale to fit stroke

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.480 
here is the actual scale to fit stroke
length<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.740> most<00:01:13.890> common<00:01:14.340> one

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
length this is the most common one

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.780 
length this is the most common one
you'll<00:01:14.700> use<00:01:15.830> supply<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:17.070> changes<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.729> you

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
you'll use supply that changes and you

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.810 
you'll use supply that changes and you
can<00:01:17.909> see<00:01:18.030> there<00:01:18.380> regardless<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.650> what<00:01:19.920> how

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
can see there regardless of what how

can see there regardless of what how
long<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.240> make<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.479> stroke<00:01:22.369> it'll<00:01:23.369> always<00:01:23.610> be

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
long to make the stroke it'll always be

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.300 
long to make the stroke it'll always be
the<00:01:24.750> same<00:01:25.049> thickness<00:01:25.320> regardless<00:01:26.189> of

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
the same thickness regardless of

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.940 
the same thickness regardless of
whatever<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.729> do<00:01:26.880> with<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.090> stroke<00:01:27.710> now<00:01:28.710> last

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
whatever you do with a stroke now last

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.710 
whatever you do with a stroke now last
but<00:01:29.070> not<00:01:29.250> least<00:01:29.520> let's<00:01:30.060> go<00:01:30.240> ahead<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.600> select

this one right here this is called

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.760 
this one right here this is called
stretched<00:01:33.180> between<00:01:33.360> guides<00:01:33.810> now<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.439> guides

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770

you<00:01:35.009> can<00:01:35.040> kind<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.490> change<00:01:35.729> here<00:01:36.090> if<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.479> like

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689

you can kind of change here if you like
you<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.200> make<00:01:37.229> sure<00:01:37.380> your<00:01:37.619> guys<00:01:37.740> go<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.189> far

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
you can make sure your guys go this far

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.230 
you can make sure your guys go this far
or<00:01:39.090> male<00:01:39.780> default<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.409> like<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.240> let's

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
or male default is like this so let's

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.880 
or male default is like this so let's
say<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.360> brought<00:01:42.630> my<00:01:42.840> guides<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:43.380> close

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
say I brought my guides this close

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.580 
say I brought my guides this close
together<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.869> would<00:01:45.869> leave<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.170> strokes<00:01:46.439> like

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
together I would leave the strokes like

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.280 
together I would leave the strokes like
there's<00:01:46.829> actually<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.100> difference<00:01:48.140> it<00:01:49.140> would

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
there's actually the difference it would

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.520 
there's actually the difference it would
pretty<00:01:49.470> much<00:01:49.560> make<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.950> nice<00:01:50.220> taper<00:01:51.140> like<00:01:52.140> that

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.450 

okay<00:01:55.530> everybody<00:01:55.890> we've<00:01:56.040> come<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.340> end<00:01:56.430> of

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
okay everybody we've come to the end of

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.700 
okay everybody we've come to the end of
our<00:01:56.610> tutorial<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.240> part<00:01:57.990> two<00:01:58.170> will<00:01:58.320> actually

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
our tutorial and part two will actually

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.200 
our tutorial and part two will actually
draw<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.159> little<00:01:59.280> character<00:01:59.820> and<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.119> will

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
draw in a little character and it will
