00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:08.330
 hello pascal meunier creation and 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.180
 creative design of cardboard furniture 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.820
 I'm going to talk to you today about the 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.799
 protecting your cardboard furniture you 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.600
 just finish your cardboard furniture and 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.000
 you do not know how to protect it 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.560
 well you can just 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.480
 use a floor sealer 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.060
 the application is done with a brush 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.700
 directly on your furniture on all 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.170
 the parts where there is paper the 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.750
 painting it is not necessary 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.330
 only the paper you go 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.850
 apply it like these directly 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.610
 on your furniture in the sense of the paper 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:45.320
 it's better and you put two 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:47.750
 layers when you applied your 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.850
 viticator pays attention to that 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.329
 do not dribble on the sides because 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.180
 otherwise it's dry and it stays so put 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.710
 well a little brushstroke like this 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.320
 to properly remove this operation 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.270
 will be renewed about every two to 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.549
 three years since at the end of a certain 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.609
 time the glazer is no longer very 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.889
 effective so every 2-3 years handed over 

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:12.409
 a layer of vitrifier like you 

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:14.719
 just do it the viticator is going 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.210
 enable our furniture to become 

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:19.459
 waterproof and so it's a piece of furniture that 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.189
 then can be in a room 

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:23.869
 baths without any problem 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.399
 the interest also of those glazer 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.950
 it is that you will be able to clean your 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:30.740
 furniture like a classic wooden furniture 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.359
