00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
mean I think it's five years maybe even

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:14.880 
mean I think it's five years maybe even
less<00:03:14.080> nowadays

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
less nowadays

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.369 
less nowadays
I<00:03:14.920> mean<00:03:15.519> baseball<00:03:15.700> you<00:03:15.940> can<00:03:16.030> play<00:03:16.239> 10<00:03:16.569> 15<00:03:17.049> 20

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379 
I mean baseball you can play 10 15 20

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:19.740 
I mean baseball you can play 10 15 20
years<00:03:17.590> even<00:03:17.739> and<00:03:18.489> I<00:03:19.000> mean<00:03:19.180> it's<00:03:19.269> less<00:03:19.510> of<00:03:19.540> a

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
years even and I mean it's less of a

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.410 
years even and I mean it's less of a
toll<00:03:19.930> on<00:03:19.959> your<00:03:20.170> body<00:03:20.230> so<00:03:20.980> I<00:03:21.040> think<00:03:21.420> baseball

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
toll on your body so I think baseball

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.390

would<00:03:22.810> be<00:03:22.930> a<00:03:22.959> better<00:03:23.470> bet<00:03:23.680> in<00:03:23.799> the<00:03:23.860> future<00:03:24.220> I

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
would be a better bet in the future I

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.479 
would be a better bet in the future I
think<00:03:24.879> he<00:03:25.030> has<00:03:25.299> that<00:03:25.629> level-headedness<00:03:26.620> where

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
think he has that level-headedness where

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.330 
think he has that level-headedness where
he<00:03:27.700> can<00:03:27.849> adjust<00:03:28.299> to<00:03:28.599> failure<00:03:29.079> a<00:03:29.379> lot<00:03:30.099> of<00:03:30.250> these

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
he can adjust to failure a lot of these

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.789 
he can adjust to failure a lot of these
super<00:03:31.000> athletes<00:03:31.450> and<00:03:31.599> these<00:03:31.690> super<00:03:31.840> kids<00:03:32.290> have

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
super athletes and these super kids have

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:34.890 
super athletes and these super kids have
never<00:03:33.069> failed<00:03:33.340> in<00:03:33.489> their<00:03:33.640> whole<00:03:33.790> life<00:03:34.030> seventh

a<00:03:36.459> new<00:03:36.909> Little<00:03:37.329> League<00:03:37.480> World<00:03:37.659> Series<00:03:37.810> and<00:03:38.319> I

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
a new Little League World Series and I

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.569 
a new Little League World Series and I
think<00:03:39.220> he<00:03:39.810> can<00:03:40.810> handle<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:41.410> failure<00:03:41.799> a<00:03:42.099> lot<00:03:42.340> of

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
think he can handle the failure a lot of

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.190 
think he can handle the failure a lot of
the<00:03:42.760> great<00:03:43.000> athletes<00:03:43.239> don't<00:03:43.690> make<00:03:43.840> it<00:03:44.019> to<00:03:44.109> the

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
the great athletes don't make it to the

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.110 
the great athletes don't make it to the
end<00:03:44.319> because<00:03:44.440> of<00:03:44.680> the<00:03:44.859> failure<00:03:45.220> factor<00:03:45.670> and

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
end because of the failure factor and

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.430 
end because of the failure factor and
they<00:03:46.180> don't<00:03:46.359> know<00:03:46.510> they<00:03:46.780> have<00:03:46.810> never<00:03:47.109> dealt

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
they don't know they have never dealt

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.949 
they don't know they have never dealt
with<00:03:47.590> it<00:03:47.709> and<00:03:48.280> I<00:03:48.400> think<00:03:48.459> he<00:03:48.849> has<00:03:49.329> the<00:03:49.510> ability

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
with it and I think he has the ability

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.039 
with it and I think he has the ability
to<00:03:49.989> adjust<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:51.700> failure<00:03:52.090> and<00:03:52.299> mirana<00:03:52.720> keep

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
to adjust the failure and mirana keep

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.110 
to adjust the failure and mirana keep

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
with anything who had kids and so it was

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:18.719
