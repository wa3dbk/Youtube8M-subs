00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.190
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.990
 scream ready today we talk about such 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.940
 car like t 96 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.160
 be sure to go to the VKontakte group 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.320
 in our new join it 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.210
 because as old to say the least 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.279
 collapsed so you enter into a new 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.630
 the link has become in the description so obligatory 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.150
 advertising so let's say our group 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.369
 finished so proceed to d 96 what 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.550
 here it has changed compared to t110 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.380
 and 3 up to a whole car speed 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.080
 remained the same gun in general, too 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.170
 the only thing that changed the body cut 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.660
 cutting corners made it so different 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.750
 slightly shaped and shifted the turret into 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.760
 right side this is by the way somewhat not 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.800
 very convenient because it used to be 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:49.350
 turret in the back of the cabin and in the center 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.010
 that is, it was possible to leave as something more 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.590
 less 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.539
 not substituting and and now if you 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.760
 drive in from the awkward side to you 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.550
 this will cram the turret 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.230
 who is not lazy and in general who is not lazy and she 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.320
 all the more so now is much closer 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.600
 to the front of the cabin, and then it 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.520
 will appear faster because of the hill 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.140
 will not allow the opponent on it 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.600
 shoot that is in this terms it 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.060
 but not that straight nerve but just 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.770
 Of course they did the trick of the owner t110 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.259
 yttrium which used to tank and 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.770
 Now, in general, and will be potankovat 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.840
 more difficult 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.600
 further why is it more difficult to tank 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.790
 as it turned out the bottom armor plates have this 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.220
 Fri-Sau is no longer so 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.590
 adamante vy what it was before that there 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.140
 earlier lower armor plates you 110 and 3 do not 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.650
 fought his way now fights his way so 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.270
 you know guys who want to endure 396 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.100
 shoot either this hatch 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.189
 it used to be the only opportunity 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.329
 defeat t110 and 3 shoot and in 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.399
 commander's cup 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.920
 either shoot her in lower armor 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.360
 lower armor liner of course not before 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.490
 made his way now he starts 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.159
 make my way there anyway 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.350
 punched and you will see it in the second fight 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.909
 by the way in the second battle will be small 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.439
 podlagivaniya would like to immediately 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.200
 apologize online a little 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.659
 Heated so here 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.550
 the car basically didn’t change 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.250
 there is hp we only have the gun left 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.379
 too but you can still ponerfili 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.400
 say that is due to the fact that now 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:19.709
 us room in another part of the cabin this is the most 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.190
 here you see commander's turret as in 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.880
 she is fun stuffed there is not just 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.459
 wonderful cram 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.160
 it seems that armor has not changed, but 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.900
 now generally without problems they cram us 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.810
 in this commander tower only 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.120
 that when you're going to tank somehow 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.010
 from the left side of the hull then yes when 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.200
 your right side of the case be hidden 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.840
 behind the stone then you will be proper 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.790
 well done you can pretty well so 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.019
 deal damage and not get 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.019
 almost nothing in return 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.239
 also it changed but also the only one 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.849
 a moment that is not immediately noticeable and this 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.250
 it is the roof of the cabin before she firstly 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:59.340
 It was a little higher in my cabin or such 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.799
 the most important thing is the front now 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.720
 part of the cabin is cut down as you see 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.640
 yes at small angles and if 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.920
 the enemy will be several 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.049
 above you then he will be able to pierce you in 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.120
 roof chopping before it was done 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:15.569
 harder and earlier from her very much 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.700
 ricochete la and now she is shot and 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.290
 and really punches if the opponent 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.430
 tall tank if opponent on 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.109
 some knoll 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.600
 and you will just shoot 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:27.359
 its upper part he will take you there 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.030
 punching is not great at all 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:32.970
 just not very cool but in every 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.280
 case, the car still still hit 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.560
 and if competently try on it 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.389
 to tank it is in principle really done 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.430
 but not on all maps and not on any 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:44.069
 situations then you can generally 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.910
 get out of the water of course in battle 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:49.590
 such situations where t110 e3 is just 96 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.810
 now be able to talk to the fullest 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.579
 almost gone just because i 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.720
 now changed so much worse 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:58.739
 side and done 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.989
 less comfortable game from armor just 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.120
 because now right if you drive 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.709
 on the right side, they will strike you right 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.290
 if they shoot at the commander 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.419
 wheelhouse commander turret commander 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.069
 felling already start talking or if you 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:12.720
 will shoot at the bottom armor sheet about you 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.879
 now, too, will be pushed there before 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.630
 it was not then it turns out now 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.760
 you before 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.370
 so strong so be careful 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.959
 owners and those who moved moved put 10 3 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.180
 You can be a little upset, but in 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.610
 Basically nothing really is serious 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.500
 the first fight has changed on this machine 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.110
 we are coming to the end of course here 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.270
 chopped the concore in the turret and here is the second 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.160
 a fight that a little bit cruel can 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.110
 notice how my allies are against 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.540
 a little twitch and how am I 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.670
 it's a little subscribe online at 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.370
 I did not care about that but in any 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:47.250
 case what can be said comparing this 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.170
 car with t110 and 3 to t110 and 3 to me 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.970
 liked a little more just due to 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.880
 the fact that it was more convenient to tank 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.520
 but overall the car stayed the same 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.240
 that is, lamb but I did not get a gun 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.370
 changed 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.990
 we didn’t even change the speed, that is, in 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.630
 the whole remains the same if that 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.260
 made a breakthrough possible and lower 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.840
 armor sheet 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.220
 and shifted the commander's turret in 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.530
 some case will probably be 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.750
 more convenient but some situations and not 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.840
 so it's great again to decide only 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.930
 you and in general the car who have those 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.190
 already decide what they liked more 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.340
 maybe someone will like it more 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.290
 396 I’m surely nobody here 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.170
 I can not impose anything because 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:30.600
 I personally liked up to 110 3 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:33.300
 more though i still think d 96 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.370
 quite a good car well, just 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.380
 usually fall into the wrong situations 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.800
 which can be potankov yes and time 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:44.010
 there was not much car anyway 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.050
 Now little changed changed 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.120
 slightly changed tactics as necessary on 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.950
 her tank but you can quickly 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.460
 adjust whether you are up to 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:55.290
 We are playing long and hard on the T110 and 3 well, 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.330
 Perhaps the lower armor is still 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:00.120
 very strong just me with gold 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.580
 hell breaking through Shilka 701 object namely 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.680
 there I think you saw there two holes from 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.750
 his shots but gold of course 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.350
 breaking through this tank is pretty 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:12.630
 cheat though now and found him 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:14.610
 not a bad catcher, but I don't know how 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.690
 play him a good competitor found in 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.240
 form is a 6 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:20.400
 if in head-on head push object 701 and 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.310
 out of 6, then out of 6 is likely to come out 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.740
 801 close range winner 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.500
 the gun is not very accurate and Isa 6 is not so 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.500
 too much 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:32.440
 points where it can be recovered punch and 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.390
 humiliate in general then of 6 in melee 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.070
 against eights feel just 

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:37.900
 great because he has a weapon 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:40.030
 oblique she near to miss will 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.700
 it's hard and his armor is just 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:44.890
 wonderful and so on from 6 to 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.290
 Video principle was in my not even 

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:49.810
 one is already so go look 

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:51.700
 necessarily if you have not seen and 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:54.850
 understand what this is actually for 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.150
 unit so well and with respect to t to t 96 I summarize 

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:57.790
 already 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:59.950
 failed and we are just inspecting this varnish 

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.240
 well, you and fights a little just because 

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:04.840
 internet basement 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:07.060
 brought here is such a new machine t110 

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:09.040
 those three replaced we said goodbye to me 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.440
 even did life farewell video on it 

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:14.940
 you can see there as me fun 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:17.710
 merged and now we have what we have 

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:19.630
 I also probably have to do 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:22.810
 video on fv 4005 

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:24.610
 a little up and or do another 

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:26.919
 video project in the queue so 

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:29.470
 choose absolutely everything depends only 

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:31.690
 from you write in the comments what 

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:34.870
 do the first project queue or video 

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:36.940
 pf 4005 well, and offer your some 

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:38.919
 other video options in the comments 

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.690
 maybe some kind of tank comparison 

00:07:38.919 --> 00:07:42.580
 maybe just a guide to the new tanks 

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.979
 which I forgot to consider because 

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:48.100
 now maybe i can buy time already
