00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.410 
the Gateway the keyhole that's what this
stuff<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.590> it's<00:01:38.460> obviously<00:01:38.880> not<00:01:39.030> been<00:01:39.210> walking

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
stuff is it's obviously not been walking

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.819 
stuff is it's obviously not been walking
around<00:01:39.750> because<00:01:39.900> has<00:01:40.200> anything<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.680> do<00:01:40.799> with

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
around because has anything to do with

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:41.990 
around because has anything to do with
what<00:01:41.100> happened<00:01:41.400> because<00:01:41.640> they<00:01:41.790> can<00:01:41.909> in

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
what happened because they can in

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.310 
what happened because they can in
mainstream<00:01:42.210> media<00:01:42.420> came<00:01:42.750> out<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:42.960> debunked

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
mainstream media came out and debunked

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.929 
mainstream media came out and debunked
this<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.560> well<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.950> thing<00:01:44.159> turns<00:01:44.490> out<00:01:44.700> it's<00:01:44.850> a

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
this so well that thing turns out it's a

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.060 
this so well that thing turns out it's a
lie<00:01:45.259> so<00:01:46.259> why<00:01:46.380> they<00:01:46.500> got<00:01:46.649> people<00:01:46.950> walking

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
lie so why they got people walking

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.130 
lie so why they got people walking
around<00:01:47.340> doing<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:47.729> stuff<00:01:47.939> for<00:01:48.149> them<00:01:48.329> because

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
around doing this stuff for them because

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.840 
around doing this stuff for them because
they're<00:01:49.500> having<00:01:49.649> them<00:01:49.890> perform<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.310> ritual<00:01:50.490> and

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
they're having them perform a ritual and

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.819 
they're having them perform a ritual and
they're<00:01:51.509> doing<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.810> representation<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.649> this

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
they're doing a representation of this

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.760 
they're doing a representation of this
thing<00:01:53.070> right<00:01:53.250> here<00:01:53.280> yep<00:01:54.350> the<00:01:55.350> two<00:01:55.530> pillars

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
certainly well certainly we all work

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.569 
certainly well certainly we all work

the<00:02:38.700> dual<00:02:38.909> pillars<00:02:40.159> this<00:02:41.159> thing<00:02:41.400> is<00:02:41.549> broken

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
the dual pillars this thing is broken

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.119 
the dual pillars this thing is broken
they're<00:02:42.629> trying<00:02:42.959> to<00:02:43.019> fix<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.469> they're<00:02:43.859> firing

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
they're trying to fix it they're firing

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.190 
they're trying to fix it they're firing
up<00:02:44.430> CERN<00:02:44.700> it<00:02:45.000> all<00:02:45.359> fits<00:02:45.689> all<00:02:45.840> tied<00:02:46.049> together

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
up CERN it all fits all tied together

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.929 
up CERN it all fits all tied together
and<00:02:46.530> they're<00:02:46.769> trying<00:02:47.069> to<00:02:47.129> open<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.489> Stargate

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:47.939 
and they're trying to open the Stargate

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:52.610 
and they're trying to open the Stargate
in<00:02:48.090> 2017<00:02:49.079> and<00:02:49.980> this<00:02:50.790> is<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.540> representation<00:02:52.079> of

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
in 2017 and this is a representation of

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.140 
in 2017 and this is a representation of
this<00:02:54.139> and<00:02:55.139> it's<00:02:55.829> obvious<00:02:56.220> that<00:02:56.459> they're<00:02:56.909> not

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
this and it's obvious that they're not

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.699 
this and it's obvious that they're not
doing<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:57.569> because<00:02:57.659> of<00:02:57.900> anything<00:02:58.469> that<00:02:58.590> had<00:02:58.680> to

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
doing it because of anything that had to

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.530 
doing it because of anything that had to
do<00:02:58.889> with<00:02:58.919> the<00:02:59.159> whole<00:02:59.280> story<00:02:59.609> because<00:03:00.269> it's

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
do with the whole story because it's

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.199 
do with the whole story because it's
turned<00:03:00.840> out<00:03:01.019> to<00:03:01.079> be<00:03:01.439> a<00:03:01.469> lie<00:03:01.909> so<00:03:02.909> they've<00:03:03.060> got

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
turned out to be a lie so they've got

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.670 
turned out to be a lie so they've got
people<00:03:03.329> walking<00:03:03.629> around<00:03:03.930> not<00:03:04.260> knowing<00:03:04.290> what

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
people walking around not knowing what

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.179

they're doing helping summoning these

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:10.759 
they're doing helping summoning these

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
see it very well but that's what it is

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:46.969 
see it very well but that's what it is
and<00:04:44.970> when<00:04:45.090> I<00:04:45.120> think<00:04:45.350> what<00:04:46.350> I<00:04:46.380> think<00:04:46.470> this<00:04:46.800> is

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
and when I think what I think this is

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:47.840 
and when I think what I think this is
right<00:04:47.190> in<00:04:47.310> front<00:04:47.370> of<00:04:47.610> it

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
right in front of it

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.770 
right in front of it
using<00:04:48.210> now<00:04:48.360> a<00:04:48.389> little<00:04:48.630> bit<00:04:48.810> I<00:04:50.479> think<00:04:51.479> this<00:04:51.630> is

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
using now a little bit I think this is

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.450 
using now a little bit I think this is
meanness<00:04:52.169> it's<00:04:52.350> one<00:04:52.470> of<00:04:52.590> Saturn's<00:04:52.740> moons<00:04:52.979> the

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
meanness it's one of Saturn's moons the

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.070 
meanness it's one of Saturn's moons the
death<00:04:53.639> star<00:04:53.849> but<00:04:54.150> I<00:04:54.180> can't<00:04:54.419> say<00:04:54.599> for<00:04:54.660> sure<00:04:54.810> but

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
death star but I can't say for sure but

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.350 
death star but I can't say for sure but
there's<00:04:55.440> Saturn<00:04:55.710> and<00:04:56.460> what's<00:04:57.210> most

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
there's Saturn and what's most

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.060 
there's Saturn and what's most
