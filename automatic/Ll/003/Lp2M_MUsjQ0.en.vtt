of y'all know earlier in the summer I
made<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.830> video<00:00:07.980> called<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.519> stick<00:00:08.760> weld

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
made a video called the stick weld

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.000 
made a video called the stick weld
smackdown<00:00:09.570> in<00:00:09.719> which<00:00:09.840> I<00:00:09.960> took<00:00:10.019> I<00:00:10.380> believe<00:00:10.620> four

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
smackdown in which I took I believe four

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.560 
smackdown in which I took I believe four
or<00:00:11.280> five<00:00:11.519> of<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.820> most<00:00:11.910> common<00:00:12.090> stick

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
or five of the most common stick

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.230 
or five of the most common stick
electrodes<00:00:12.750> out<00:00:13.230> there<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:13.650> I<00:00:14.309> welded<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.089> few

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
electrodes out there and I welded a few

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.849 
electrodes out there and I welded a few
joints<00:00:15.450> with<00:00:15.690> them<00:00:15.839> did<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.109> nice<00:00:16.260> break<00:00:16.560> test

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
joints with them did a nice break test

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.220 
joints with them did a nice break test
and<00:00:17.210> you<00:00:18.210> know<00:00:18.300> just<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.630> see<00:00:18.779> which<00:00:18.900> one<00:00:19.109> was

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
and you know just to see which one was

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.660 
and you know just to see which one was
strongest<00:00:19.650> 70181<00:00:20.400> by<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.789> way<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:22.279> but<00:00:23.279> one

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
strongest 70181 by the way and but one

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.070 
strongest 70181 by the way and but one
of<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.820> electrodes<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.330> didn't<00:00:24.600> test<00:00:24.750> in<00:00:24.930> that

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
of the electrodes I didn't test in that

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.710 
of the electrodes I didn't test in that
was<00:00:25.289> 70<00:00:25.680> 24<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:26.970> had<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.119> few<00:00:27.300> people<00:00:27.420> in<00:00:27.630> the

welding 2012 on YouTube I'll put a link

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.000 
welding 2012 on YouTube I'll put a link
to<00:00:36.660> his<00:00:36.750> channel<00:00:36.780> in<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.290> description<00:00:37.320> there

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
to his channel in the description there

to his channel in the description there
gave<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.820> handful<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.210> 70<00:00:39.570> 24<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.140> try<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.530> I

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
gave you a handful of 70 24 to try and I

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.750 
gave you a handful of 70 24 to try and I
decided<00:00:40.920> what<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.129> heck<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.370> might<00:00:41.579> as<00:00:41.700> well

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
still have these joints yes I did some

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.220 
still have these joints yes I did some
on<00:00:47.399> eBay<00:00:47.730> but<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.539> guy<00:00:48.660> never<00:00:48.870> ended<00:00:49.140> up

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
on eBay but the guy never ended up

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.720 
on eBay but the guy never ended up
paying<00:00:49.410> for<00:00:49.530> them<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:49.980> never<00:00:50.160> ship<00:00:50.370> them<00:00:50.579> and

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
paying for them so I never ship them and

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.549 
paying for them so I never ship them and
they're<00:00:50.820> still<00:00:51.000> here<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:51.809> because<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.350> still

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
they're still here so because I still

they're still here so because I still
have<00:00:52.710> my<00:00:52.949> able<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.489> make<00:00:54.390> two<00:00:54.600> more<00:00:54.750> plates

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
have my able to make two more plates

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.750 
have my able to make two more plates
identical<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.890> ones<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.219> we<00:00:56.280> use<00:00:56.430> here

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
identical to the ones that we use here

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.220 
identical to the ones that we use here
they're<00:00:57.000> out<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.300> same<00:00:57.510> batch<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:58.020> Steel

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
they're out of the same batch of Steel

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.220 
they're out of the same batch of Steel
and<00:00:58.469> everything<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.550> so<00:01:00.480> with<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.170> being

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
and everything and so with that being

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.850 
and everything and so with that being
said<00:01:01.500> let's<00:01:02.219> take<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:03.359> last<00:01:03.690> 70<00:01:04.409> 20<00:01:04.680> for

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
said let's take this last 70 20 for

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.770 
said let's take this last 70 20 for
lecture<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.460> happen<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.760> have<00:01:05.909> here<00:01:06.180> run

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
lecture that I happen to have here run

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.420 
lecture that I happen to have here run
it<00:01:06.810> on<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.080> precision<00:01:07.350> TIG<00:01:07.710> as<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.070> can<00:01:08.220> see

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
it on the precision TIG as you can see

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.780 
it on the precision TIG as you can see
I've<00:01:08.729> got<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.119> set<00:01:09.299> up<00:01:09.330> at<00:01:09.630> 130<00:01:10.590> amps<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.189> then

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
I've got it set up at 130 amps and then

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.340 
I've got it set up at 130 amps and then
we'll<00:01:12.119> just<00:01:12.299> beat<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.510> apart<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.049> see<00:01:13.170> how<00:01:13.260> it

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
we'll just beat it apart and see how it

00:01:13.350 --> 00:02:10.840 
we'll just beat it apart and see how it
does

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.790 

so<00:02:11.850> this<00:02:12.030> is<00:02:12.180> my<00:02:12.330> weld<00:02:12.570> I'm<00:02:13.110> really<00:02:13.410> happy<00:02:13.620> with

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
so this is my weld I'm really happy with

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.170 
so this is my weld I'm really happy with
the<00:02:13.920> way<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.070> came<00:02:14.130> out<00:02:14.400> except<00:02:14.730> for<00:02:14.880> that<00:02:14.940> nice

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
the way it came out except for that nice

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.910 
the way it came out except for that nice
big<00:02:15.390> wormhole<00:02:15.900> right<00:02:16.110> there

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
big wormhole right there

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.190 
big wormhole right there
I<00:02:16.950> would<00:02:17.550> run<00:02:17.730> this<00:02:17.910> again<00:02:18.180> if<00:02:18.300> I<00:02:18.390> had<00:02:18.570> more<00:02:18.780> 70

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
I would run this again if I had more 70

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.370 
I would run this again if I had more 70
24s<00:02:19.740> which<00:02:19.860> I<00:02:19.980> don't<00:02:20.250> so<00:02:20.610> I<00:02:20.640> can't<00:02:21.090> honestly<00:02:21.930> it

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
24s which I don't so I can't honestly it

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.350 
24s which I don't so I can't honestly it
probably<00:02:22.920> won't<00:02:23.160> make<00:02:23.550> that<00:02:23.880> much<00:02:24.150> of<00:02:24.180> a

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
probably won't make that much of a

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.270 
probably won't make that much of a
difference<00:02:24.720> as<00:02:24.870> 90<00:02:25.230> something<00:02:25.710> percent<00:02:25.890> of

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
difference as 90 something percent of

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.430 
difference as 90 something percent of
the<00:02:26.340> weld<00:02:26.520> it's<00:02:26.760> just<00:02:27.030> fine<00:02:27.300> but<00:02:27.870> my<00:02:28.020> weld<00:02:28.230> is

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
the weld it's just fine but my weld is

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.410 
the weld it's just fine but my weld is
at<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.710> little<00:02:29.070> bit<00:02:29.190> of<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.340> disadvantage<00:02:29.640> right

off the get-go here with that being said
I'm<00:02:32.790> going<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:32.970> tack<00:02:33.180> this<00:02:33.360> down<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.690> my<00:02:33.810> table

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
I'm going to tack this down to my table

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.960 
I'm going to tack this down to my table
a<00:02:34.200> little<00:02:34.380> bit<00:02:34.530> better<00:02:34.770> break<00:02:35.220> out<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.490> bfh

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
a little bit better break out the bfh

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.970 
a little bit better break out the bfh
and<00:02:36.240> I<00:02:36.810> will<00:02:36.990> see<00:02:37.140> how<00:02:37.200> much<00:02:37.320> abuse<00:02:37.560> this<00:02:37.800> thing

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
and I will see how much abuse this thing

00:02:37.980 --> 00:03:04.480 
and I will see how much abuse this thing
can<00:02:38.100> take

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.560 

except<00:03:05.870> she<00:03:06.870> likes<00:03:07.170> of<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.560> 14th<00:03:08.460> did<00:03:08.670> huh

all<00:03:10.080> right<00:03:10.470> oh<00:03:10.500> but<00:03:10.860> it's<00:03:11.010> not<00:03:11.160> broken<00:03:11.580> yet

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
all right oh but it's not broken yet

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.700 
all right oh but it's not broken yet
shoot<00:03:13.400> or<00:03:14.400> abuse<00:03:14.750> as<00:03:15.750> I'd<00:03:15.960> be<00:03:16.200> careful<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.680> not

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
shoot or abuse as I'd be careful to not

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:27.190 
shoot or abuse as I'd be careful to not
accidentally<00:03:17.460> take<00:03:17.670> out<00:03:17.820> the<00:03:17.940> lights<00:03:18.150> in<00:03:18.330> here

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.850 

all<00:03:28.200> right

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
all right

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:54.380 
all right
sing<00:03:29.190> like<00:03:29.370> that

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.700 

Wow<00:03:55.580> that's<00:03:56.580> just<00:03:56.910> pretty<00:03:57.060> much<00:03:57.270> it<00:03:58.230> started

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
Wow that's just pretty much it started

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.500 
Wow that's just pretty much it started
going<00:03:58.860> it<00:03:59.250> seemed<00:03:59.760> like<00:03:59.910> it's<00:04:00.090> pretty<00:04:00.390> well

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
going it seemed like it's pretty well

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.820 
going it seemed like it's pretty well
that's<00:04:01.440> just<00:04:01.560> brilliant<00:04:02.150> yeah<00:04:03.530> all<00:04:04.530> right

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.860 

would<00:04:07.830> you<00:04:07.950> look<00:04:08.130> at<00:04:08.190> that<00:04:08.280> YouTube<00:04:08.910> there's

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
would you look at that YouTube there's

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.630 
would you look at that YouTube there's
not<00:04:10.290> a<00:04:10.320> whole<00:04:10.770> lot<00:04:11.070> of<00:04:11.100> difference<00:04:11.580> between

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
not a whole lot of difference between

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.320 
not a whole lot of difference between
the<00:04:12.000> 7014<00:04:12.780> and<00:04:13.050> the<00:04:13.170> other<00:04:13.470> 70<00:04:13.800> 24<00:04:14.310> as<00:04:14.580> you<00:04:15.180> can

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
the 7014 and the other 70 24 as you can

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.000 
the 7014 and the other 70 24 as you can
see<00:04:15.480> this<00:04:15.600> one<00:04:15.780> was<00:04:15.900> a<00:04:15.930> clean<00:04:16.260> straight<00:04:16.680> break

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
see this one was a clean straight break

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.300 
see this one was a clean straight break
this<00:04:17.730> one<00:04:17.910> was<00:04:18.060> a<00:04:18.090> little<00:04:18.359> bit<00:04:18.450> more<00:04:18.570> jagged

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
this one was a little bit more jagged

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.349 
this one was a little bit more jagged
don't<00:04:20.310> really<00:04:20.459> know<00:04:20.579> what<00:04:20.760> would<00:04:20.850> cost<00:04:21.030> that

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
don't really know what would cost that

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.990 
don't really know what would cost that
but<00:04:21.989> the<00:04:22.109> break<00:04:22.320> itself<00:04:22.680> looks<00:04:23.400> the<00:04:23.580> same<00:04:23.760> on

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
but the break itself looks the same on

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.480 
but the break itself looks the same on
both<00:04:24.030> welds<00:04:24.690> and<00:04:24.870> they<00:04:25.560> both<00:04:25.740> took<00:04:25.770> roughly

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
both welds and they both took roughly

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.940 
both welds and they both took roughly
the<00:04:26.610> same<00:04:26.790> number<00:04:26.850> of<00:04:27.440> hits<00:04:28.440> before<00:04:28.800> they

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
the same number of hits before they

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.130 
the same number of hits before they
broke<00:04:29.160> one<00:04:29.910> thing<00:04:30.090> I<00:04:30.180> will<00:04:30.330> point<00:04:30.360> out<00:04:30.750> is<00:04:30.990> on

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
broke one thing I will point out is on

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.100 
broke one thing I will point out is on
the<00:04:31.230> 70<00:04:31.500> 24<00:04:31.980> you<00:04:32.820> can<00:04:32.970> see<00:04:33.150> that<00:04:33.630> I<00:04:33.720> only<00:04:33.750> made

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
the 70 24 you can see that I only made

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.690 
the 70 24 you can see that I only made
it<00:04:34.140> to<00:04:34.290> there<00:04:34.530> before<00:04:34.830> I<00:04:34.860> had<00:04:35.040> to<00:04:35.250> switch

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
it to there before I had to switch

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.460 
it to there before I had to switch
electrodes<00:04:36.240> and<00:04:36.480> I<00:04:36.510> started<00:04:36.870> back<00:04:37.020> over<00:04:37.260> here

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
electrodes and I started back over here

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.580 
electrodes and I started back over here
weld<00:04:37.890> it<00:04:38.040> over<00:04:38.250> this<00:04:38.370> way<00:04:38.430> with<00:04:39.360> the<00:04:39.480> 70<00:04:39.840> 24<00:04:40.350> i

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
weld it over this way with the 70 24 i

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.620 
weld it over this way with the 70 24 i
welded<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:41.730> entire<00:04:42.000> thing<00:04:42.300> with<00:04:42.450> one

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
welded the entire thing with one

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.690 
welded the entire thing with one
electrode<00:04:43.110> didn't<00:04:43.830> have<00:04:43.919> a<00:04:43.950> lot<00:04:44.130> left<00:04:44.310> over<00:04:44.520> is

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
electrode didn't have a lot left over is

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.159 
electrode didn't have a lot left over is
pretty<00:04:44.880> much<00:04:45.000> just<00:04:45.180> a<00:04:45.300> stub<00:04:45.540> but<00:04:45.810> nonetheless

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
pretty much just a stub but nonetheless

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.650 
pretty much just a stub but nonetheless
I<00:04:46.560> got<00:04:46.710> done<00:04:46.980> with<00:04:47.100> one<00:04:47.220> electrode<00:04:47.669> and<00:04:47.910> so

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
I got done with one electrode and so

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.310 
I got done with one electrode and so
anyway<00:04:49.290> hopefully<00:04:49.650> now<00:04:50.040> I<00:04:50.390> have<00:04:51.390> completed

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
anyway hopefully now I have completed

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.440 
anyway hopefully now I have completed
