show you how to make a twist a tramp

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.770 
show you how to make a twist a tramp
like<00:00:05.580> this<00:00:06.919> all<00:00:07.919> right<00:00:08.099> it's<00:00:08.370> so<00:00:08.639> very<00:00:09.450> easy

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.680 
it's really really easy all you gotta do
is<00:00:12.929> place<00:00:13.799> one<00:00:14.340> small<00:00:14.910> room<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:15.450> then<00:00:16.520> simply

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
is place one small room and then simply

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.029 
is place one small room and then simply
place<00:00:18.690> on<00:00:18.840> our<00:00:18.930> small<00:00:19.439> round<00:00:19.650> pick<00:00:19.830> it<00:00:19.949> up

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
place on our small round pick it up

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.340 
place on our small round pick it up
again<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:21.560> rotate<00:00:22.560> it<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.859> little<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.490> left

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
again and rotate it a little to the left

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.349 
again and rotate it a little to the left
in<00:00:25.350> this<00:00:25.859> case<00:00:26.099> because<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.490> want<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.730> go<00:00:26.910> that

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
in this case because I want to go that

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.179 
in this case because I want to go that
way<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:30.170> let's<00:00:31.170> put<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.590> there<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.099> then

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
way so let's put it there and then

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.750 
way so let's put it there and then
switch<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.090> signs<00:00:33.860> right<00:00:34.860> Sharon<00:00:35.280> roadside

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
switch to signs right Sharon roadside

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.090 
switch to signs right Sharon roadside
then<00:00:36.239> switch<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.930> left<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.800> should<00:00:38.010> do

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
then switch to the left and I should do

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.680 
then switch to the left and I should do
that<00:00:38.280> press<00:00:38.850> place<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:40.879> you<00:00:41.879> do<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.270> until

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
that press place and you do that until

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:50.299 
that press place and you do that until
you<00:00:42.750> Oh<00:00:45.170> until<00:00:46.170> it's<00:00:46.350> placed<00:00:47.750> like<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:49.309> okay

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
you Oh until it's placed like that okay

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.330 
you Oh until it's placed like that okay
then<00:00:50.899> simply<00:00:51.899> do<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.260> again<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:53.809> you<00:00:54.809> can

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
then simply do that again and you can

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.720 
then simply do that again and you can
also<00:00:56.340> loop<00:00:56.610> like<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.949> twist<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.100> just<00:00:59.489> a

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
also loop like that and twist it just a

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.770 
also loop like that and twist it just a
little<00:01:00.800> every<00:01:01.800> time<00:01:04.909> so<00:01:05.909> if<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.180> just<00:01:06.360> rotate

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
little every time so if you just rotate

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.149 
little every time so if you just rotate
it<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.080> little<00:01:07.409> it's<00:01:07.799> going<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.159> be<00:01:11.210> like<00:01:12.210> this

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
it a little it's going to be like this

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.679 
it a little it's going to be like this
now<00:01:14.159> i'm<00:01:14.310> going<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.640> show<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.820> what<00:01:15.330> happens

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
now i'm going to show you what happens

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.679 
now i'm going to show you what happens
if<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.900> rotate<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.590> lot<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:17.939> yeah<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.210> can<00:01:18.479> make

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
if you rotate a lot so yeah you can make

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.929 
if you rotate a lot so yeah you can make
things<00:01:18.900> like<00:01:19.200> this<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:20.400> can<00:01:20.430> experiment

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
things like this and you can experiment

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.620 
things like this and you can experiment
a<00:01:21.210> bit<00:01:21.409> make<00:01:22.409> different<00:01:22.860> shapes<00:01:23.450> you<00:01:24.450> don't

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
a bit make different shapes you don't

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.010 
a bit make different shapes you don't
want<00:01:24.780> people<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.170> fall<00:01:25.380> off<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:26.100> i've<00:01:26.460> placed

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
want people to fall off so i've placed

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.749 
want people to fall off so i've placed
these<00:01:28.020> things<00:01:28.909> on<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.090> ramp<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:31.759> basically

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
these things on the ramp and basically

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:40.130 
these things on the ramp and basically
what<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.600> do<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:35.150> decide<00:01:38.060> you<00:01:39.060> go<00:01:39.270> from<00:01:39.540> this

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
what you do is decide you go from this

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.940 
what you do is decide you go from this
to<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.890> view<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.990> to<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.170> view<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.740> then

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
to this view to to that view and then

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.240 
to this view to to that view and then
press<00:01:44.340> place<00:01:45.200> then<00:01:47.090> rotate<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.270> just<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.720> little

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
press place then rotate it just a little

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.530 
press place then rotate it just a little
and<00:01:50.250> make<00:01:51.240> sure<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:52.530> next<00:01:52.829> each<00:01:53.189> next<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.270> the

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
and make sure the next each next of the

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.380 
and make sure the next each next of the
low<00:01:55.500> match<00:01:55.770> shuttering<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:57.350> behind<00:01:59.390> the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
low match shuttering is behind the

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.609 
low match shuttering is behind the
previous<00:02:01.310> shuttering<00:02:02.600> so<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:04.079> good<00:02:04.350> and

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
previous shuttering so this is good and

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.460 
previous shuttering so this is good and
for<00:02:05.520> example<00:02:06.619> this<00:02:07.619> is<00:02:07.829> bad<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.399> this<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.270> good

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
for example this is bad and this is good

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.690 
for example this is bad and this is good
so<00:02:12.900> if<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:14.050> continue<00:02:14.470> like<00:02:14.500> that<00:02:14.650> by<00:02:15.280> rotating

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
so if you continue like that by rotating

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.320 
so if you continue like that by rotating
it<00:02:15.880> just<00:02:16.120> a<00:02:16.210> little<00:02:16.540> you<00:02:17.040> pretty<00:02:18.040> much<00:02:18.070> always

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.360 

ask<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.630> next<00:02:22.870> shuttering<00:02:23.410> behind<00:02:23.860> the

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
ask the next shuttering behind the

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:36.140 
ask the next shuttering behind the
purchase<00:02:26.040> so<00:02:27.040> that<00:02:27.280> should<00:02:27.610> not<00:02:27.820> be<00:02:28.060> a<00:02:28.090> problem

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.180 

if<00:02:37.150> I've<00:02:37.330> missed<00:02:37.570> anything<00:02:37.990> if<00:02:38.500> you<00:02:38.770> have<00:02:38.890> any

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190
