00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
to see the display and it seems like

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.480 
to see the display and it seems like
sometimes<00:04:31.180> the<00:04:31.780> display<00:04:32.110> goes<00:04:32.139> darker<00:04:32.860> when

sometimes the display goes darker when

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.909 
sometimes the display goes darker when
you<00:04:33.700> go<00:04:33.880> play<00:04:34.180> some<00:04:34.389> games<00:04:34.630> because<00:04:35.470> and<00:04:35.740> I

don't even have that display feature on
and<00:04:38.380> which<00:04:39.040> I<00:04:39.220> found<00:04:39.490> kind<00:04:39.610> of<00:04:39.730> weird<00:04:39.910> why<00:04:40.180> it

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
and which I found kind of weird why it

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.860 
and which I found kind of weird why it
is<00:04:40.810> doing<00:04:41.230> that<00:04:41.350> I'm<00:04:41.650> not<00:04:41.830> quite<00:04:42.070> sure<00:04:42.750> but<00:04:43.750> it

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
is doing that I'm not quite sure but it

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.840 
is doing that I'm not quite sure but it
seems<00:04:44.020> to<00:04:44.260> be<00:04:44.440> something<00:04:45.270> inside<00:04:46.270> here<00:04:46.930> and

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
seems to be something inside here and

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
seems to be something inside here and
you<00:04:48.850> just<00:04:49.419> go<00:04:49.660> to<00:04:54.419> dynamic<00:04:55.419> you<00:04:55.570> can<00:04:55.630> see

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870
