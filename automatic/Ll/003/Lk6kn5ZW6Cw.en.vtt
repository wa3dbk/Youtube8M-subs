two years probably for quantum warfare 3
comes<00:03:30.750> out<00:03:30.930> I<00:03:31.170> mean<00:03:31.410> I<00:03:32.040> don't<00:03:32.819> know<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:33.329> you

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
comes out I mean I don't know and you

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.330 
comes out I mean I don't know and you
know<00:03:33.930> even<00:03:34.200> how<00:03:34.260> those<00:03:34.470> four<00:03:34.680> sniper<00:03:34.950> rifles

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
know even how those four sniper rifles

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.160 
know even how those four sniper rifles
only<00:03:35.609> two<00:03:35.819> of<00:03:35.970> them<00:03:36.030> are<00:03:36.120> gonna<00:03:36.180> be<00:03:36.450> you<00:03:37.109> know

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
only two of them are gonna be you know

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.250 
only two of them are gonna be you know
probably<00:03:38.040> 80%<00:03:38.519> one-shot<00:03:39.359> kills<00:03:39.660> depending<00:03:40.139> on

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
probably 80% one-shot kills depending on

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.680 
probably 80% one-shot kills depending on
your<00:03:40.380> accuracy<00:03:40.620> a<00:03:40.859> game<00:03:41.130> way<00:03:41.370> so<00:03:42.030> now<00:03:42.389> we're

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
your accuracy a game way so now we're

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.150 
your accuracy a game way so now we're
down<00:03:42.810> to<00:03:42.870> like<00:03:43.049> two<00:03:43.319> sniper<00:03:43.620> rifles<00:03:44.010> that<00:03:44.069> we

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
down to like two sniper rifles that we

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.860 
down to like two sniper rifles that we
got<00:03:44.280> to<00:03:44.370> play<00:03:44.549> with<00:03:44.760> for<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.090> next<00:03:45.120> freakin

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
got to play with for the next freakin

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.460 
got to play with for the next freakin
you<00:03:46.560> know<00:03:46.650> two<00:03:46.709> years<00:03:47.310> I<00:03:47.579> myself<00:03:47.730> oh<00:03:48.000> geez<00:03:48.989> here

we go again but uh yeah I mean on all

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.280 
we go again but uh yeah I mean on all
the<00:03:53.040> game<00:03:53.190> looks<00:03:53.430> great<00:03:53.609> I<00:03:54.329> plan<00:03:54.930> on<00:03:54.959> doing<00:03:55.079> a

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
the game looks great I plan on doing a

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.890 
the game looks great I plan on doing a
lot<00:03:55.350> of<00:03:55.410> things<00:03:55.680> for<00:03:56.450> autocephaly<00:03:57.450> I'm<00:03:57.569> doing

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
lot of things for autocephaly I'm doing

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.650 
lot of things for autocephaly I'm doing
one<00:03:58.769> more<00:03:58.889> matrix<00:03:59.370> montage<00:03:59.790> and<00:04:00.510> I'll

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
one more matrix montage and I'll

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.759 
one more matrix montage and I'll
probably<00:04:00.900> put<00:04:01.170> out<00:04:01.319> another<00:04:01.530> gameplay

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
probably put out another gameplay

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.550 
probably put out another gameplay
montage<00:04:02.160> or<00:04:02.850> well<00:04:03.420> just<00:04:03.600> add<00:04:03.720> gameplay<00:04:04.260> video

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
montage or well just add gameplay video

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
want to blow the lid off black ops I

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.910 
want to blow the lid off black ops I
kind<00:04:18.330> of<00:04:18.390> got<00:04:18.539> in<00:04:18.690> late<00:04:18.930> that's

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
kind of got in late that's

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.350 
kind of got in late that's
world<00:04:20.070> was<00:04:20.190> everything<00:04:20.610> a<00:04:20.670> model<00:04:20.940> warfare<00:04:21.210> too

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:21.360 
world was everything a model warfare too

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.150 
world was everything a model warfare too
so<00:04:21.600> I<00:04:21.660> kind<00:04:21.900> of<00:04:21.930> just<00:04:22.080> slacked<00:04:22.590> off<00:04:22.800> basically

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
so I kind of just slacked off basically

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
obviously in general we get some side by

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.610 
obviously in general we get some side by
sides<00:04:45.360> and<00:04:45.810> I'm<00:04:46.050> actually<00:04:46.260> gonna<00:04:46.470> start

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
sides and I'm actually gonna start

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.410 
sides and I'm actually gonna start
getting<00:04:47.010> death<00:04:47.220> a<00:04:47.250> little<00:04:47.520> bit<00:04:47.610> more<00:04:47.820> on

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
getting death a little bit more on

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.050 
getting death a little bit more on
weapons<00:04:49.170> different<00:04:49.890> tricks<00:04:50.070> you<00:04:50.190> can<00:04:50.220> do<00:04:50.520> in

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
you from the point-blank basics of like

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.710 
you from the point-blank basics of like
sensitivity<00:05:04.050> and<00:05:05.120> snapshotting<00:05:06.120> versus<00:05:06.420> drag

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
sensitivity and snapshotting versus drag

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.780 
sensitivity and snapshotting versus drag
shot<00:05:06.990> and<00:05:07.290> then<00:05:07.650> take<00:05:08.040> it<00:05:08.070> up<00:05:08.220> from<00:05:08.430> there<00:05:08.580> you

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
shot and then take it up from there you
