pulls and pushes the landing gear to

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.020 
pulls and pushes the landing gear to
follow<00:01:26.909> along<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.979> specific<00:01:28.979> path<00:01:29.220> when<00:01:29.909> it

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
follow along the specific path when it

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.710 
follow along the specific path when it
actuates<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.750> rotates<00:01:31.470> out<00:01:31.619> 90<00:01:31.950> degrees<00:01:32.720> and

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
actuates and rotates out 90 degrees and

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.660 
actuates and rotates out 90 degrees and
when<00:01:33.900> it's<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:35.329> it<00:01:36.329> looks<00:01:36.509> like<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.670> it

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
when it's in it looks like this so it

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.219 
when it's in it looks like this so it
follows<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.060> cam<00:01:39.240> all<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.479> way<00:01:39.570> back<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:39.990> by

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
follows the cam all the way back in by

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.590 
follows the cam all the way back in by
the<00:01:40.290> air<00:01:40.470> cylinder<00:01:40.950> here<00:01:41.280> which<00:01:42.060> again<00:01:42.180> drives

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
the air cylinder here which again drives

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.190 
the air cylinder here which again drives
that<00:01:42.840> cam<00:01:43.829> which<00:01:44.159> pushes<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.630> rotate<00:01:46.020> up

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
that cam which pushes this to rotate up

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.569 
that cam which pushes this to rotate up
like<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.159> then<00:01:47.909> with<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.210> wheel<00:01:48.450> on<00:01:48.689> one

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
like that and then with a wheel on one

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:51.530 
like that and then with a wheel on one
second<00:01:50.579> okay

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
second okay

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.679 
second okay

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
the wheel on its going to look pretty

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.910 
the wheel on its going to look pretty
nice<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:56.960> that<00:01:57.960> we<00:01:58.140> mount<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.500> into<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.770> wing

follower here and the difference that

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.059 
follower here and the difference that
this<00:02:40.849> has<00:02:41.120> over<00:02:41.469> typical<00:02:42.469> tricycle<00:02:43.040> landing

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
this has over typical tricycle landing

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.489 
this has over typical tricycle landing
gear<00:02:43.340> made<00:02:44.060> retro<00:02:44.419> bar<00:02:44.599> is<00:02:44.780> this<00:02:44.900> actually<00:02:45.349> has

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:45.499 
gear made retro bar is this actually has

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:48.819 
gear made retro bar is this actually has
a<00:02:45.829> full<00:02:46.519> rotation<00:02:46.730> of<00:02:47.150> 105<00:02:47.689> degrees<00:02:48.079> which<00:02:48.799> is

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
a full rotation of 105 degrees which is

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.879 
a full rotation of 105 degrees which is
important<00:02:49.430> for<00:02:49.639> this<00:02:49.849> kit<00:02:50.180> because<00:02:51.019> you<00:02:51.739> need

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:51.889 
important for this kit because you need

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:53.530 
important for this kit because you need
that<00:02:51.919> extra<00:02:52.040> 15<00:02:52.699> degrees<00:02:52.969> of<00:02:53.000> clearance<00:02:53.449> to

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
that extra 15 degrees of clearance to

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.619 
that extra 15 degrees of clearance to
drive<00:02:54.019> that<00:02:55.060> landing<00:02:56.060> gear<00:02:56.150> up<00:02:56.329> a<00:02:56.480> little

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
drive that landing gear up a little

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.140 
drive that landing gear up a little
higher<00:02:56.840> inside<00:02:57.349> the<00:02:57.530> model<00:02:57.739> to<00:02:58.519> clear<00:02:58.879> some<00:02:59.120> of

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
higher inside the model to clear some of

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.849 
higher inside the model to clear some of
the<00:02:59.239> other<00:02:59.620> components<00:03:00.620> that<00:03:00.709> you're

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:00.859 
the other components that you're

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:04.030 
the other components that you're
building<00:03:01.189> in<00:03:01.280> for<00:03:02.209> the<00:03:02.299> aircraft<00:03:02.689> so<00:03:03.409> it's

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
building in for the aircraft so it's

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.679 
building in for the aircraft so it's
definitely<00:03:04.459> a<00:03:04.549> time-saver<00:03:05.269> otherwise<00:03:05.540> you

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:05.689 
definitely a time-saver otherwise you

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:07.659 
definitely a time-saver otherwise you
have<00:03:05.780> to<00:03:05.840> do<00:03:05.930> some<00:03:06.079> modifications<00:03:06.709> but<00:03:07.489> with

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:07.669 
have to do some modifications but with

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:10.000 
have to do some modifications but with
this<00:03:07.819> setup<00:03:08.060> you<00:03:08.389> don't<00:03:08.719> have<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:09.049> and<00:03:09.260> Robart

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
this setup you don't have to and Robart

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.550 
this setup you don't have to and Robart
is<00:03:10.129> nice<00:03:10.310> enough<00:03:10.459> actually<00:03:11.290> customized<00:03:12.290> and

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
is nice enough actually customized and

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.220 
is nice enough actually customized and
made<00:03:13.120> retracts<00:03:14.120> for<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:14.689> Beechcraft<00:03:15.079> Bonanza
