 Hi Assassin. Here Gabe Graziani, community director at Assassin's Creed Unity ... 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.520
 Here is Ariadne MacGillivray, community manager on Assassin's Creed Unity as well. 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.280
 There are more than one now! 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.540
 What do we do here, Ari? 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.460
 Thank you for your question Gabe. We are here to learn the Art of Parkour, Assassin's Creed style. 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.340
 Haha, yes! 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.460
 Hello guys, my name is Steven, the owner of The Spot and I'll show you some of the Parkour moves today. 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.500
 First, we must exercise. Is essential, and helps you prepare. 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.760
 Help the blood flow! 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.260
 So, the first technique, part of the exercise, is to learn how to jump. 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.980
 Knees at the top. 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.240
 Waaaaaaaaaaah !!! 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.800
 The experience of Parkour gave me a new concept of the game. 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.460
 It made me understand the difficulties faced by the drawing team ... 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.520
 To take movements from the real world and integrate them into the world of the game, because it is not normal. 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.204
 at least. 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.560
 The high climbing on things was ... fear of the highlands I think. 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.460
 When I jumped, it was fun and ... awesome! 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:09.940
 Complete! 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.160
 Arno does it easily, it's hard to imagine how difficult it is in a real situation. 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.680
 greeting! 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.560
 Laughter 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.080
 Now you go out! 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.040
 Yes Ari! 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.160
 The best thing is that this is the most terrifying thing I've done, and now I'm a poster in bed. 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.280
 But! 

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:47.265
 I suffer in several places! 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.100
 And here these will not improve! 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.917
 These will not improve! 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.820
 A tendon injury. 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.820
 Because it was that jump, I wanted to succeed. 

00:03:04.155 --> 00:03:05.595
 I'm suffering from laughter! 

00:03:07.234 --> 00:03:10.214
 Thank you for your patience, Assassin. 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.655
 Thanks to The Spot for hosting us and teaching us this painful art. 

00:03:14.655 --> 00:03:19.578
 We would like to thank UbiWorkshop for providing us with these shirts. 

00:03:19.578 --> 00:03:23.578
 I want to let everyone know that Parkour is bad, and we do not recommend anyone to do it. 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.760
 It's the worst. 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.377
 We will not practice it again. 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.400
 It was a terrible mistake. 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.580
 Parkour !!!
