00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
i said if possible to pinpoint it to a

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.380 
i said if possible to pinpoint it to a
video<00:03:05.190> and<00:03:05.489> a<00:03:05.580> time<00:03:05.790> in<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.030> video<00:03:06.209> that's

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
video and a time in the video that's

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.720 
video and a time in the video that's
even<00:03:06.660> better<00:03:06.780> if<00:03:07.080> you<00:03:07.440> don't<00:03:07.680> remember<00:03:08.040> just

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
even better if you don't remember just

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.550 
even better if you don't remember just
kind<00:03:08.940> of<00:03:09.060> guesstimate<00:03:09.989> where<00:03:10.260> do<00:03:10.350> you<00:03:10.440> think

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
kind of guesstimate where do you think

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.350 
kind of guesstimate where do you think
it<00:03:10.680> would<00:03:10.800> be<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.250> i'll<00:03:11.550> try<00:03:11.850> and<00:03:11.970> find<00:03:12.180> it

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
it would be and i'll try and find it

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.330 
it would be and i'll try and find it
because<00:03:12.450> usually<00:03:12.660> what<00:03:13.019> happens<00:03:13.050> is<00:03:13.560> like<00:03:14.220> I

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
because usually what happens is like I

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.160 
because usually what happens is like I
named<00:03:14.610> my<00:03:14.790> videos<00:03:15.150> with<00:03:15.360> a<00:03:15.390> special<00:03:15.750> title<00:03:16.050> so

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
named my videos with a special title so

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.930 
named my videos with a special title so
that<00:03:16.320> helps<00:03:16.560> me<00:03:16.680> pinpoint<00:03:16.890> certain<00:03:17.430> events<00:03:17.760> so

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
that helps me pinpoint certain events so

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.699 
that helps me pinpoint certain events so
if<00:03:18.329> I<00:03:18.390> found<00:03:18.660> it<00:03:18.780> funny<00:03:18.989> that<00:03:19.079> I<00:03:19.230> might<00:03:19.590> have

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
if I found it funny that I might have

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.440 
if I found it funny that I might have
named<00:03:19.920> it<00:03:20.070> after<00:03:20.220> so<00:03:20.640> but<00:03:20.850> you<00:03:21.150> get<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.299> idea

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.530
