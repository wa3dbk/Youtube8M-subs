00:00:01.743 --> 00:00:03.461
 We know that when the cerebral artery 

00:00:03.461 --> 00:00:05.272
 be blocked, brain tissue, 

00:00:05.272 --> 00:00:09.070
 which this vessel feeds, can very quickly die. 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.135
 Neurons die without oxygen, 

00:00:11.135 --> 00:00:13.167
 which they receive from the bloodstream. 

00:00:13.167 --> 00:00:14.734
 This is a stroke. 

00:00:14.734 --> 00:00:16.139
 It turns out we see 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.659
 this interesting pattern in brain tissue, 

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:20.574
 who had a stroke. 

00:00:20.574 --> 00:00:22.304
 We see two different 

00:00:22.304 --> 00:00:24.336
 areas of injury. 

00:00:24.336 --> 00:00:26.565
 The zone closest to the artery, 

00:00:26.565 --> 00:00:29.863
 which has been blocked, is called an ischemic nucleus. 

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:32.119
 There is a zone on the periphery of 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.238
 the nucleus, called ischemic penumba, 

00:00:35.238 --> 00:00:38.872
 which is ischemic but still vital cerebral tissue. 

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:41.205
 Before explaining these two areas, 

00:00:41.205 --> 00:00:43.829
 let's draw them on the other brain here. 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:44.746
 Note this here 

00:00:44.746 --> 00:00:46.534
 is the left side of this brain. 

00:00:46.534 --> 00:00:48.531
 Here is the right side. 

00:00:48.531 --> 00:00:50.320
 We're watching this brain 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.800
 to his left. 

00:00:53.883 --> 00:00:56.437
 In this view we see something like this, 

00:00:56.437 --> 00:00:59.537
 here we see an ischemic nucleus. 

00:00:59.537 --> 00:01:01.708
 And the distribution of the middle cerebral artery, 

00:01:01.708 --> 00:01:03.578
 because it was blocked. 

00:01:03.578 --> 00:01:05.789
 And then we will see the ischemic penumba, 

00:01:05.814 --> 00:01:09.123
 a kind surrounding the ischemic nucleus. 

00:01:09.123 --> 00:01:11.429
 Let's first talk about the kernel. 

00:01:11.454 --> 00:01:13.167
 In the core area 

00:01:13.167 --> 00:01:15.104
 there is severe ischemia. 

00:01:15.129 --> 00:01:16.175
 It's a serious ischaemia 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.781
 blood flow 20% less than normal. 

00:01:19.781 --> 00:01:21.109
 There is a massive loss 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:23.210
 two vital for neurons 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.905
 and cell-supporting nutrients. 

00:01:24.905 --> 00:01:27.738
 Oxygen and glucose are lost, 

00:01:27.738 --> 00:01:30.640
 because they are using what is already in the field, 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.405
 but these stocks are not filled in, 

00:01:32.405 --> 00:01:34.135
 because there is no more blood flow. 

00:01:34.135 --> 00:01:36.320
 What will happen is 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.872
 that severe ischaemia will cause death 

00:01:38.872 --> 00:01:41.507
 neurons and supporting cells. 

00:01:41.507 --> 00:01:43.435
 This is called necrosis. 

00:01:43.435 --> 00:01:45.571
 It happens in minutes. 

00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:46.974
 It only takes a few minutes 

00:01:46.974 --> 00:01:48.543
 to die the neurons in the nucleus. 

00:01:48.543 --> 00:01:50.238
 And the penumbra? 

00:01:50.238 --> 00:01:51.830
 I said there are two different areas. 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.744
 The penubra is the edge 

00:01:53.744 --> 00:01:55.706
 of medium ischemic tissue, 

00:01:55.706 --> 00:01:58.336
 which lies outside the core zone, between the core 

00:01:58.361 --> 00:02:01.034
 and normal brain tissue. 

00:02:01.034 --> 00:02:02.779
 The tissue in the penumber 

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:05.200
 he will not die immediately. 

00:02:05.297 --> 00:02:07.293
 It is medium-fed tissue. 

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:09.871
 She gets some blood 

00:02:09.871 --> 00:02:13.710
 of arteries nearby, called parallel arteries. 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.674
 Oxygen is coming out of 

00:02:16.674 --> 00:02:19.240
 these blood vessels 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.537
 and still powers the neurons in this ischemic half-life (penumba). 

00:02:22.537 --> 00:02:25.242
 With the white points I mean 

00:02:25.242 --> 00:02:28.876
 the oxygen coming out of these parallel blood vessels. 

00:02:28.876 --> 00:02:32.371
 These neurons in the midsection get some glucose 

00:02:32.371 --> 00:02:34.762
 and oxygen from the parallel arteries. 

00:02:34.762 --> 00:02:36.841
 But the catch is that it will not last forever. 

00:02:36.841 --> 00:02:39.023
 In fact, the neurons in the half-field 

00:02:39.023 --> 00:02:40.405
 will also die, 

00:02:40.405 --> 00:02:43.035
 if blood flow does not recover early enough, 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.410
 somewhere about a few hours 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.001
 after the vascular obstruction has occurred. 

00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:47.731
 That's because of the parallel circulation 

00:02:47.731 --> 00:02:49.588
 is not enough to support needs 

00:02:49.588 --> 00:02:52.270
 of the neurons in the half-life of oxygen and glucose 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.114
 more than a few hours. 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:55.765
 I want to touch more 

00:02:55.765 --> 00:02:57.170
 two things about the half-moon. 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.467
 First, the more parallel blood vessels you have, 

00:03:00.467 --> 00:03:02.673
 the more neurons in the hemisphere have. 

00:03:02.673 --> 00:03:04.774
 That's good, because 

00:03:04.774 --> 00:03:07.607
 these neurons will not immediately die. 

00:03:07.607 --> 00:03:09.337
 Of course, these are necessary 

00:03:09.337 --> 00:03:11.206
 arteries not blocked. 

00:03:11.206 --> 00:03:13.133
 For example, this drawing here 

00:03:13.133 --> 00:03:15.711
 the half-life may exist, 

00:03:15.711 --> 00:03:19.090
 because this parallel artery is still open. 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.273
 This parallel artery is still open. 

00:03:22.273 --> 00:03:27.100
 But if the blocking happens here, 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.271
 just before each artery to branched out, 

00:03:29.271 --> 00:03:31.441
 then none of these arteries 

00:03:31.466 --> 00:03:32.358
 there will be no blood inside, 

00:03:32.383 --> 00:03:36.228
 so it will not exist. 

00:03:36.228 --> 00:03:39.209
 It would just be a dead core. 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.336
 But then there may be 

00:03:40.336 --> 00:03:41.740
 other parallel vessels, 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.702
 creating a different hemisphere. 

00:03:43.702 --> 00:03:45.897
 Maybe this court and this court. 

00:03:45.897 --> 00:03:47.522
 There would be new parallel arteries 

00:03:47.522 --> 00:03:50.007
 for this newly created ischemic nucleus. 

00:03:50.032 --> 00:03:53.330
 Let me write this: more parallel is equal 

00:03:53.355 --> 00:03:58.016
 of more oxygen for neurons at risk of ischemic death. 

00:03:58.041 --> 00:03:59.736
 The second thing is that half-life 

00:03:59.736 --> 00:04:01.129
 is the area where it is most possible 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.103
 medicines to be effective. 

00:04:03.103 --> 00:04:04.507
 What does this mean? 

00:04:04.507 --> 00:04:06.806
 One of the goals of the treatment is to break this clot 

00:04:06.806 --> 00:04:09.836
 and the blood returned to the ischemic area. 

00:04:09.836 --> 00:04:11.087
 The blood must come back 

00:04:11.087 --> 00:04:13.203
 in the ischemic field as soon as possible. 

00:04:13.203 --> 00:04:14.666
 This will effectively save 

00:04:14.666 --> 00:04:16.605
 neurons in the hemisphere. 

00:04:16.605 --> 00:04:19.171
 I delete this blue half- 

00:04:19.171 --> 00:04:21.377
 to show that they are getting enough oxygen now 

00:04:21.377 --> 00:04:22.689
 and enough glucose, 

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:24.337
 so that they function normally again. 

00:04:24.337 --> 00:04:26.079
 Perhaps, unfortunately, the neurons 

00:04:26.079 --> 00:04:27.971
 in the kernel they will have died. 

00:04:27.971 --> 00:04:29.840
 I recall in a hurry. 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.036
 If for any reason 

00:04:31.036 --> 00:04:33.906
 blood flow stops to some part of the brain, 

00:04:33.931 --> 00:04:37.710
 an ischemic nucleus and an ischemic half-life will form. 

00:04:37.735 --> 00:04:39.500
 Neurons in their supporting cells, 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.829
 which are in the ischemic nucleus, 

00:04:41.829 --> 00:04:43.851
 they will die in a few minutes. 

00:04:43.851 --> 00:04:45.909
 A neurons and their supporting cells 

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:47.906
 in the ischemic half-life (penumba) 

00:04:47.906 --> 00:04:50.204
 will die after a few hours without treatment. 

00:04:50.204 --> 00:04:52.114
 They will live longer, 

00:04:52.114 --> 00:04:53.501
 than the core, because they receive it 

00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:56.286
 blood from the parallel arteries.
