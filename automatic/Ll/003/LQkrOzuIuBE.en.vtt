I'm<00:00:40.530> going<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.770> double<00:00:40.890> check<00:00:41.040> but<00:00:41.340> I'm<00:00:41.430> pretty

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
I'm going to double check but I'm pretty

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.060 
I'm going to double check but I'm pretty
sure<00:00:42.110> you<00:00:43.110> should<00:00:43.260> go<00:00:43.350> in<00:00:43.469> all<00:00:43.620> these<00:00:43.770> holes

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.910 
sure you should go in all these holes
right<00:00:44.219> here<00:00:45.289> so<00:00:46.289> I'm<00:00:46.350> just<00:00:46.469> going<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.649> drop<00:00:46.800> the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
right here so I'm just going to drop the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.729 
right here so I'm just going to drop the
bolts<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.309> there<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.850> then<00:00:48.559> start<00:00:49.559> getting

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
bolts in there and then start getting

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.049 
bolts in there and then start getting
ready<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.129> torque<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.430> down<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.820> also<00:00:51.030> a

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
ready to torque it down and also a

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.650 
ready to torque it down and also a
little<00:00:51.239> tip<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.780> put<00:00:52.350> my<00:00:52.500> intake<00:00:53.160> gasket<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:53.910> I'm

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
little tip I put my intake gasket on I'm

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.000 
little tip I put my intake gasket on I'm
going<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.110> swing<00:00:55.320> around<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.649> show<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.829> that

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
going to swing around and show you that

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.970 
going to swing around and show you that
your<00:00:56.309> stress<00:00:56.550> meets<00:00:56.760> there<00:00:57.500> it's<00:00:58.500> easier<00:00:58.890> to

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
your stress meets there it's easier to

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.770 
your stress meets there it's easier to
put<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.340> before<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.879> put<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.600> head<00:01:00.750> on

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
put it on before you put the head on

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.020 
put it on before you put the head on
because<00:01:01.770> it'd<00:01:01.980> be<00:01:02.129> kind<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.399> tricky<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.730> put<00:01:02.940> it

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
because it'd be kind of tricky to put it

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.140 
because it'd be kind of tricky to put it
on<00:01:03.149> now<00:01:03.359> because<00:01:04.309> the<00:01:05.309> bolts<00:01:05.610> stick<00:01:05.820> out<00:01:06.000> and

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
on now because the bolts stick out and

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.320 
on now because the bolts stick out and
they're<00:01:06.270> going<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.450> bump<00:01:06.869> into<00:01:07.049> stuff<00:01:07.260> so

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
they're going to bump into stuff so

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.880 
they're going to bump into stuff so
exhaust<00:01:09.330> gaskets<00:01:09.630> still<00:01:10.080> off<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.320> party<00:01:10.770> that

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
exhaust gaskets still off a party that

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.969 
exhaust gaskets still off a party that
last<00:01:11.420> there's<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.540> thermal<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.140> gaskets<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.770> got

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
last there's a thermal the gaskets I got

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.160 
last there's a thermal the gaskets I got
so<00:01:14.340> everything<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:14.880> could<00:01:15.060> figure<00:01:15.270> out<00:01:15.420> where

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
so everything I could figure out where

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.510 
so everything I could figure out where
it<00:01:16.290> goes<00:01:16.470> just<00:01:16.500> by<00:01:16.799> looking<00:01:17.040> at<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.220> put<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.460> up

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
it goes just by looking at it put it up

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.109 
it goes just by looking at it put it up
top<00:01:17.700> here<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.439> there's<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.530> chart<00:01:19.860> on<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.880> box

them<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:59.450> you<00:02:00.450> want<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.689> make<00:02:00.780> sure<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.990> get<00:02:01.110> a

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
them and you want to make sure you get a

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.440 
them and you want to make sure you get a

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
it and also so oh there's different

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.880 
it and also so oh there's different
methods<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.899> they're<00:02:06.990> not<00:02:07.110> wrong<00:02:07.350> they're

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
methods and they're not wrong they're

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.589 
methods and they're not wrong they're
just<00:02:08.069> different<00:02:08.280> so<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.000> really<00:02:09.300> want<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.569> to

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
just different so I really want you to

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.940 
just different so I really want you to
look<00:02:09.780> this<00:02:09.929> up<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.289> don't<00:02:10.379> want<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.590> say<00:02:10.770> this

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
look this up so I don't want to say this

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.360 
look this up so I don't want to say this
is<00:02:11.129> I<00:02:11.250> do<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.610> because

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
is I do it because

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.979 
is I do it because
um<00:02:12.640> you<00:02:13.180> really<00:02:13.330> need<00:02:13.540> to<00:02:13.599> have<00:02:13.690> a<00:02:13.780> book

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
um you really need to have a book

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.420 
um you really need to have a book
telling<00:02:14.260> you<00:02:14.440> what<00:02:14.620> your<00:02:14.739> torque<00:02:14.950> sequences

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
telling you what your torque sequences

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.520 
telling you what your torque sequences
are<00:02:15.580> so<00:02:15.819> you<00:02:15.909> can<00:02:16.000> follow<00:02:16.209> some<00:02:16.530> logical

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
are so you can follow some logical

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.470 
are so you can follow some logical
pattern<00:02:17.709> in<00:02:18.040> my<00:02:18.159> case<00:02:18.459> it<00:02:18.700> kind<00:02:18.909> of<00:02:18.940> went<00:02:19.209> like

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
pattern in my case it kind of went like

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.979 
pattern in my case it kind of went like
this<00:02:19.900> one<00:02:20.200> this<00:02:20.409> one<00:02:20.709> this<00:02:21.330> one<00:02:22.330> this<00:02:22.360> one<00:02:22.540> this

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
this one this one this one this one this

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.589 
this one this one this one this one this
one<00:02:23.379> this<00:02:23.409> one<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:23.739> then<00:02:23.980> last<00:02:24.909> one<00:02:25.090> was<00:02:25.239> an<00:02:25.360> X

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
one this one and then last one was an X

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.770 
one this one and then last one was an X
pattern<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:27.120> it<00:02:28.120> was<00:02:28.239> a<00:02:28.269> two<00:02:28.510> step<00:02:28.720> process

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
pattern and it was a two step process

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.809 
pattern and it was a two step process
for<00:02:29.349> mine<00:02:29.530> it<00:02:29.709> was<00:02:29.799> like<00:02:29.950> 22<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:32.700> 47<00:02:33.700> or

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
for mine it was like 22 and 47 or

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.490 
for mine it was like 22 and 47 or
something<00:02:34.120> like<00:02:34.269> that<00:02:34.480> but<00:02:34.989> you<00:02:35.140> really<00:02:35.379> need

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
something like that but you really need

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.380 
something like that but you really need
to<00:02:35.560> look<00:02:35.739> it<00:02:35.890> up<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:36.069> follow<00:02:36.549> a<00:02:36.670> manual<00:02:36.970> and

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
to look it up and follow a manual and

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.539 
to look it up and follow a manual and
I've<00:02:37.540> seen<00:02:37.780> I<00:02:38.049> mean<00:02:38.920> there's<00:02:39.220> just<00:02:39.430> many

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
I've seen I mean there's just many

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:40.649 
I've seen I mean there's just many
different<00:02:39.940> ways<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.180> do<00:02:40.299> that<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.540> they<00:02:40.599> all

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:40.659 
different ways to do that and they all

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.140 
different ways to do that and they all
work<00:02:40.930> well<00:02:41.200> you<00:02:41.500> just<00:02:41.680> need<00:02:41.829> to<00:02:41.980> pick<00:02:42.819> a<00:02:42.879> method

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
work well you just need to pick a method

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.089 
work well you just need to pick a method
so<00:02:43.420> you<00:02:43.540> don't<00:02:43.659> want<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:43.840> use<00:02:43.930> my<00:02:44.140> torques<00:02:44.590> with

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
so you don't want to use my torques with

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:46.289 
so you don't want to use my torques with
a<00:02:45.129> different<00:02:45.489> cross<00:02:45.609> pattern<00:02:46.000> or<00:02:46.269> something

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
a different cross pattern or something

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.569 
a different cross pattern or something
like<00:02:46.720> that<00:02:46.900> so<00:02:47.140> pretty<00:02:47.859> much<00:02:48.040> you<00:02:48.250> look<00:02:48.400> those

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
like that so pretty much you look those

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.229 
like that so pretty much you look those
up<00:02:48.750> anyway<00:02:49.750> so<00:02:49.810> I<00:02:50.400> change<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.549> gasket<00:02:51.940> in<00:02:52.060> this

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
up anyway so I change the gasket in this

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.190 
up anyway so I change the gasket in this
guy<00:02:52.450> just<00:02:53.049> tighten<00:02:53.620> that<00:02:53.650> bolts<00:02:54.579> on<00:02:54.730> there<00:02:54.910> and

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
guy just tighten that bolts on there and

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.860 
guy just tighten that bolts on there and
just<00:02:56.200> got<00:02:56.319> done<00:02:56.500> torquing<00:02:56.829> the<00:02:56.920> head<00:02:57.069> on<00:02:57.220> so

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
just got done torquing the head on so

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.229 
just got done torquing the head on so
got<00:02:58.870> the<00:02:59.049> major<00:02:59.349> tasks<00:02:59.829> that<00:02:59.890> we<00:03:00.040> comput<00:03:00.819> tried

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
got the major tasks that we comput tried

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:02.640 
got the major tasks that we comput tried
to<00:03:01.329> accomplish<00:03:01.720> which<00:03:01.900> was<00:03:02.079> replace<00:03:02.409> the<00:03:02.530> head

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
to accomplish which was replace the head

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.830 
to accomplish which was replace the head
gasket<00:03:03.069> pretty<00:03:03.370> much<00:03:03.519> done<00:03:03.819> now<00:03:04.569> we're<00:03:04.720> just

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
gasket pretty much done now we're just

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.110 
gasket pretty much done now we're just
replacing<00:03:05.349> gaskets<00:03:05.829> and<00:03:05.970> reassembling<00:03:06.970> this

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
replacing gaskets and reassembling this

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.380 
replacing gaskets and reassembling this
so<00:03:07.269> here's<00:03:07.450> a<00:03:07.510> finished<00:03:08.379> off<00:03:08.709> I<00:03:09.030> just<00:03:10.030> didn't

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
so here's a finished off I just didn't

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.369 
so here's a finished off I just didn't
put<00:03:11.230> all<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:11.620> bolts<00:03:11.920> on<00:03:12.099> the<00:03:13.109> intake<00:03:14.109> here<00:03:14.319> I

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379 
put all the bolts on the intake here I

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:15.750 
put all the bolts on the intake here I
get<00:03:14.500> my<00:03:14.620> gasket<00:03:15.010> in<00:03:15.129> there<00:03:15.250> already<00:03:15.400> from

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
get my gasket in there already from

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.890 
get my gasket in there already from
right<00:03:16.329> did<00:03:16.540> my<00:03:16.660> head<00:03:16.840> and<00:03:18.450> there's<00:03:19.450> just<00:03:19.720> one

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
right did my head and there's just one

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.589 
right did my head and there's just one
tricky<00:03:20.319> one<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:20.739> it's<00:03:21.370> right<00:03:21.669> in<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:22.239> bottom

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
tricky one and it's right in the bottom

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.949 
tricky one and it's right in the bottom
middle<00:03:22.950> so<00:03:23.950> what<00:03:24.880> I<00:03:24.910> did<00:03:25.000> just<00:03:25.150> put<00:03:25.510> a<00:03:25.569> piece<00:03:25.930> of

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
middle so what I did just put a piece of

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.390 
middle so what I did just put a piece of
tape<00:03:26.079> on<00:03:26.349> a<00:03:26.410> socket<00:03:26.709> and<00:03:27.010> I<00:03:27.069> have<00:03:27.160> a<00:03:27.190> little

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
tape on a socket and I have a little

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.699 
tape on a socket and I have a little
swivel<00:03:27.639> I<00:03:28.000> was<00:03:28.750> able<00:03:28.870> to<00:03:29.019> get<00:03:29.200> it<00:03:29.319> down<00:03:29.470> there

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
swivel I was able to get it down there

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.789 
swivel I was able to get it down there
so<00:03:30.010> I<00:03:30.040> still<00:03:30.400> need<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.760> torque<00:03:31.690> these<00:03:31.870> down<00:03:31.930> but

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
so I still need to torque these down but

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.419 
so I still need to torque these down but
that's<00:03:33.790> where<00:03:34.000> I'm<00:03:34.090> at<00:03:34.209> though
