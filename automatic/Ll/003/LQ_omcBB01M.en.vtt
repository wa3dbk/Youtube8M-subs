at<00:00:13.730> the<00:00:13.879> bottom<00:00:14.150> of<00:00:14.209> that<00:00:14.329> list<00:00:14.509> the<00:00:14.749> worst

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:15.019 
at the bottom of that list the worst

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:17.320 
at the bottom of that list the worst
number<00:00:15.589> five<00:00:15.829> the<00:00:16.070> Oakland<00:00:16.400> Raiders<00:00:16.520> I<00:00:16.910> think

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
number five the Oakland Raiders I think

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.670 
number five the Oakland Raiders I think
it's<00:00:17.449> fair<00:00:17.660> to<00:00:17.690> say<00:00:17.840> that<00:00:18.020> their<00:00:18.320> reputation

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
it's fair to say that their reputation

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.560 
it's fair to say that their reputation
of<00:00:19.130> the<00:00:19.190> black<00:00:19.400> hole<00:00:19.430> the<00:00:19.880> days<00:00:20.090> of<00:00:20.300> yore

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
of the black hole the days of yore

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.360 
of the black hole the days of yore
that's<00:00:20.840> kind<00:00:21.080> of<00:00:21.140> lingered<00:00:21.530> for<00:00:21.560> a<00:00:21.830> while<00:00:22.070> now

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:22.370 
that's kind of lingered for a while now

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.730 
that's kind of lingered for a while now
and<00:00:22.580> I<00:00:22.640> don't<00:00:22.820> see<00:00:23.000> that<00:00:23.030> same<00:00:23.510> rabid<00:00:24.470> crowd

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
and I don't see that same rabid crowd

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.410 
and I don't see that same rabid crowd
that<00:00:24.980> we<00:00:25.070> used<00:00:25.220> to<00:00:25.310> see<00:00:25.490> back<00:00:25.670> in<00:00:25.820> the<00:00:25.910> 70s<00:00:26.390> and

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
that we used to see back in the 70s and

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.970 
that we used to see back in the 70s and
80s<00:00:26.540> think<00:00:26.930> it's<00:00:27.050> a<00:00:27.080> little<00:00:27.260> more<00:00:27.380> of<00:00:27.590> a

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
80s think it's a little more of a

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.470 
80s think it's a little more of a
shallower<00:00:28.550> crowd<00:00:28.880> than<00:00:29.090> we're<00:00:29.210> used<00:00:29.240> to

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
shallower crowd than we're used to

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.000 
shallower crowd than we're used to
seeing<00:00:29.690> and<00:00:29.840> I<00:00:29.900> don't<00:00:30.050> think<00:00:30.200> one<00:00:30.410> or<00:00:30.680> two<00:00:30.830> guys

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.010 
seeing and I don't think one or two guys

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.619 
seeing and I don't think one or two guys
dressed<00:00:31.369> up<00:00:31.490> in<00:00:31.580> shoulder<00:00:31.910> pads<00:00:31.940> and<00:00:32.329> spikes

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:32.629 
dressed up in shoulder pads and spikes

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:33.970 
dressed up in shoulder pads and spikes
and<00:00:32.780> face<00:00:32.989> paint<00:00:33.230> really<00:00:33.410> makes<00:00:33.590> up<00:00:33.770> for<00:00:33.949> a

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
and face paint really makes up for a

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.739 
and face paint really makes up for a
full<00:00:34.159> fan<00:00:34.489> base<00:00:34.699> and<00:00:35.030> number<00:00:35.329> for<00:00:35.600> the

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:35.749 
full fan base and number for the

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.530 
they have like 25,000 fans by bathing in
the<00:01:21.230> sun<00:01:21.500> oh<00:01:21.770> I<00:01:22.070> did<00:01:22.400> it<00:01:22.520> it<00:01:22.640> was<00:01:22.700> brutal<00:01:23.000> now

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540

with<00:01:23.720> the<00:01:23.780> new<00:01:23.810> stadium<00:01:24.110> they've<00:01:24.380> sold<00:01:24.590> out

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.380 
with the new stadium they've sold out
every<00:01:25.010> game<00:01:25.190> since<00:01:25.430> I<00:01:25.670> think<00:01:26.060> they're<00:01:26.210> better

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
every game since I think they're better

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.880 
every game since I think they're better
but<00:01:26.720> they're<00:01:26.840> all<00:01:26.960> transplants<00:01:27.620> from<00:01:27.680> other

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
but they're all transplants from other

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.290 
but they're all transplants from other
places<00:01:28.100> so<00:01:28.430> they<00:01:28.460> don't<00:01:28.640> have<00:01:28.760> that<00:01:28.790> diehard

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
places so they don't have that diehard

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.670 
places so they don't have that diehard
grown<00:01:29.600> up<00:01:29.720> a<00:01:29.810> Cardinals<00:01:30.230> fan<00:01:30.290> their<00:01:30.560> whole

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
passionate fans to Philadelphia Eagles I

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.930 
passionate fans to Philadelphia Eagles I
think<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:06.620> fact<00:02:06.860> that<00:02:06.980> opposing<00:02:07.580> people<00:02:07.820> may

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
think the fact that opposing people may

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.320 
think the fact that opposing people may
go<00:02:08.090> in<00:02:08.239> there<00:02:08.420> and<00:02:08.569> just

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
go in there and just

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.270 
go in there and just
they<00:02:09.720> are<00:02:09.900> how<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.200> know<00:02:10.470> how<00:02:10.619> angry<00:02:10.860> they<00:02:11.130> can

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
they are how you know how angry they can

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.220 
they are how you know how angry they can
get<00:02:11.430> at<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.580> opposing<00:02:11.970> fans<00:02:12.420> maybe<00:02:12.990> that's

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
get at the opposing fans maybe that's

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.660 
get at the opposing fans maybe that's
the<00:02:13.380> fact<00:02:13.560> that<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:13.800> push<00:02:14.010> them<00:02:14.160> so<00:02:14.310> harmless

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
the fact that I push them so harmless

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.160 
the fact that I push them so harmless
but<00:02:14.940> they<00:02:15.030> are<00:02:15.150> rabid<00:02:15.600> would<00:02:15.750> have<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:16.020> say

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
but they are rabid would have to say

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.480 
but they are rabid would have to say
that<00:02:16.350> just<00:02:16.500> depends<00:02:16.770> on<00:02:16.860> your<00:02:16.950> definition<00:02:17.160> of

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
that just depends on your definition of

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.460 
that just depends on your definition of
best<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:17.940> worst<00:02:18.210> if<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.540> like<00:02:18.690> vicious<00:02:19.200> fans

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
best and worst if you like vicious fans

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.900 
best and worst if you like vicious fans
then<00:02:19.770> treat<00:02:20.010> others<00:02:20.250> like<00:02:20.340> crap<00:02:20.700> then

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
then treat others like crap then

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.370 
then treat others like crap then
probably<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.540> Eagles<00:02:21.810> would<00:02:21.870> be<00:02:22.020> a<00:02:22.050> good<00:02:22.260> one

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
probably the Eagles would be a good one

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.870 
probably the Eagles would be a good one
that<00:02:22.740> is<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.860> look<00:02:23.040> at<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.190> worst<00:02:23.370> fans<00:02:23.670> in<00:02:23.820> the
