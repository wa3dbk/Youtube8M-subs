rubber part of this cane into the next
one<00:00:24.830> need<00:00:25.730> a<00:00:25.820> little<00:00:25.970> bit<00:00:26.119> more<00:00:26.300> stability<00:00:33.850> on

one need a little bit more stability on

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:42.729 
one need a little bit more stability on
the<00:00:34.880> other<00:00:35.120> side<00:00:41.140> keep<00:00:42.140> in<00:00:42.260> mind<00:00:42.290> we're<00:00:42.590> doing

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
the other side keep in mind we're doing

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.310 
the other side keep in mind we're doing
this<00:00:42.800> on<00:00:42.950> a<00:00:42.980> budget<00:00:43.250> of<00:00:43.579> zero<00:00:44.090> just<00:00:44.990> what<00:00:45.200> we

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
this on a budget of zero just what we

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:54.160 
this on a budget of zero just what we
have<00:00:45.470> laying<00:00:45.680> around<00:00:45.800> I<00:00:52.900> guess<00:00:53.900> you<00:00:54.050> could

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
have laying around I guess you could

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.840 
have laying around I guess you could
argue<00:00:54.200> the<00:00:54.590> drywall<00:00:55.100> screws<00:00:55.400> are<00:00:55.579> couple

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
argue the drywall screws are couple

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.340 
argue the drywall screws are couple
pennies<00:00:56.000> and<00:00:56.360> you<00:00:56.450> had<00:00:56.630> to<00:00:56.720> buy<00:00:56.870> the<00:00:56.930> canes<00:00:59.350> ok

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
pennies and you had to buy the canes ok

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
good press amount that i'm using for my

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.590 
good press amount that i'm using for my
gopro<00:02:10.039> he's<00:02:11.039> in<00:02:11.190> that<00:02:11.340> one<00:02:11.520> no<00:02:11.910> i<00:02:12.209> don't<00:02:12.390> know

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
gopro he's in that one no i don't know

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.910 
gopro he's in that one no i don't know
what<00:02:12.750> it's<00:02:12.870> called<00:02:12.930> but<00:02:13.170> this<00:02:13.350> little<00:02:13.530> elbow

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
what it's called but this little elbow

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:23.120 
what it's called but this little elbow
mount<00:02:14.870> slide<00:02:15.870> it<00:02:16.050> in<00:02:16.170> here<00:02:19.459> okay<00:02:20.459> position<00:02:22.130> ok

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
mount slide it in here okay position ok

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.400 
mount slide it in here okay position ok
so<00:02:23.190> we've<00:02:23.490> ended<00:02:23.730> up<00:02:23.820> with<00:02:23.880> just<00:02:24.330> a<00:02:25.290> couple

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
so we've ended up with just a couple

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.580 
so we've ended up with just a couple
canes<00:02:26.209> my<00:02:27.209> GoPro<00:02:27.630> mounted<00:02:27.930> on<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.140> end<00:02:28.350> of<00:02:28.470> it

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
canes my GoPro mounted on the end of it

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.920 
canes my GoPro mounted on the end of it
I<00:02:31.970> didn't<00:02:32.970> have<00:02:33.090> two<00:02:33.239> of<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.450> same<00:02:33.480> type<00:02:33.900> of

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
I didn't have two of the same type of

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:34.970 
I didn't have two of the same type of
canes<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.440> guess<00:02:34.560> that<00:02:34.739> would<00:02:34.800> have<00:02:34.920> been

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
canes I guess that would have been

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.500 
canes I guess that would have been
better<00:02:35.750> so<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:36.780> have<00:02:36.959> two<00:02:37.140> different<00:02:37.680> canes

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
better so I have two different canes

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:47.750 
better so I have two different canes
