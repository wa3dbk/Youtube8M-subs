00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.869 
going to show you how to make a vending
machine<00:00:04.170> it's<00:00:04.650> a<00:00:04.799> it's<00:00:05.310> a<00:00:05.370> really<00:00:05.640> simple

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
machine it's a it's a really simple

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.970 
machine it's a it's a really simple
design<00:00:06.210> and<00:00:06.629> hopefully<00:00:07.200> even<00:00:07.500> those<00:00:07.649> of<00:00:07.830> you

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
design and hopefully even those of you

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.190 
design and hopefully even those of you
who<00:00:08.490> don't<00:00:08.700> have<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:08.880> clue<00:00:09.090> about<00:00:09.420> redstone

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
who don't have a clue about redstone

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.980 
who don't have a clue about redstone
well<00:00:10.620> understand<00:00:11.099> this<00:00:11.190> design<00:00:11.670> so<00:00:12.000> I<00:00:12.509> got<00:00:12.870> the

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
well understand this design so I got the

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.320 
well understand this design so I got the
ideas<00:00:13.349> from<00:00:13.650> this<00:00:13.830> design<00:00:14.160> from<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.610> video<00:00:15.089> I

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
ideas from this design from a video I

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.420 
ideas from this design from a video I
saw<00:00:15.660> from<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.379> person<00:00:16.859> on<00:00:16.949> YouTube<00:00:17.250> called

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
check him out he makes some pretty cool

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.620 
check him out he makes some pretty cool
stuff<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:23.010> anyway<00:00:23.820> let<00:00:24.150> me<00:00:24.180> show<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.390> how<00:00:24.510> it

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
stuff so anyway let me show you how it

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.920 
stuff so anyway let me show you how it
works

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
works

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.950 
works
umm<00:00:25.220> boots<00:00:26.369> it's<00:00:27.359> asked<00:00:27.480> for<00:00:27.660> some<00:00:27.779> boots

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
umm boots it's asked for some boots

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.200 
umm boots it's asked for some boots
they're<00:00:28.949> pops<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.279> up<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.760> gives<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.090> to

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
they're pops it up and it gives it to

you so that's basically how this one

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.950 
you so that's basically how this one
works<00:00:33.920> and<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.850> video<00:00:36.059> watch<00:00:36.270> before<00:00:36.450> didn't

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
works and the video watch before didn't

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.170 
works and the video watch before didn't
have<00:00:37.079> this<00:00:37.200> little<00:00:37.410> dispense<00:00:37.950> system<00:00:38.670> all<00:00:39.000> it

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
have this little dispense system all it

have this little dispense system all it
did<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.570> left<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:39.989> down<00:00:40.140> there<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.530> kind<00:00:41.010> of

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
did is it left it down there and kind of

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.900 
did is it left it down there and kind of
jump<00:00:41.969> into<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.329> pool<00:00:42.590> to<00:00:43.590> get<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.920> Sonia<00:00:44.730> are

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
jump into the pool to get it Sonia are

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.260 
jump into the pool to get it Sonia are
we<00:00:45.180> go<00:00:45.329> over<00:00:45.450> here<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.840> math<00:00:46.440> workstation<00:00:47.370> and

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
we go over here to math workstation and

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.540 
we go over here to math workstation and
show<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.629> how<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.809> works<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.710> first<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.489> all

show you how it works so first of all

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.020 
show you how it works so first of all
build<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.170> t-shape<00:00:52.170> like<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:53.460> know<00:00:53.670> this

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
build a t-shape like this you know this

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.930 
build a t-shape like this you know this
is<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.210> six<00:00:54.600> by<00:00:54.780> seven<00:00:55.469> grid<00:00:56.039> but<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.430> can<00:00:56.550> use

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
is a six by seven grid but you can use

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.310 
is a six by seven grid but you can use
whatever<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.270> want<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:57.750> I'm<00:00:57.840> gonna<00:00:57.960> take<00:00:58.170> down

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
whatever you want so I'm gonna take down

whatever you want so I'm gonna take down
one<00:00:58.559> more<00:00:58.710> and<00:01:00.890> and<00:01:01.890> what<00:01:02.699> I'm<00:01:02.760> gonna<00:01:02.820> do<00:01:03.030> is

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
one more and and what I'm gonna do is

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.670 
one more and and what I'm gonna do is
I'm<00:01:03.180> gonna<00:01:03.300> replace<00:01:03.600> all<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.110> down<00:01:04.409> here

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
I'm gonna replace all of this down here

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.210 
I'm gonna replace all of this down here
with<00:01:04.979> ice<00:01:05.210> so<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.680> items<00:01:07.680> traveled

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
with ice so that the items traveled

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.820 
with ice so that the items traveled
quicker<00:01:08.610> because<00:01:08.939> when<00:01:09.390> water<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.810> on<00:01:09.990> rice<00:01:10.500> it

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
quicker because when water is on rice it

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.530 
quicker because when water is on rice it
makes<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.159> travel<00:01:11.430> quicker<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:12.270> I'm<00:01:12.360> going<00:01:12.479> to

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
makes it travel quicker so I'm going to

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.270 
makes it travel quicker so I'm going to
put<00:01:12.659> dispensers<00:01:13.290> yeah<00:01:14.280> yeah<00:01:15.290> yeah<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.680> here

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
put dispensers yeah yeah yeah and here

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.600 
put dispensers yeah yeah yeah and here
I'm<00:01:17.430> gonna<00:01:17.670> fill<00:01:18.000> them<00:01:18.150> up<00:01:18.240> with<00:01:19.250> my<00:01:20.250> lovely

right now let's put the AH gonna put the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.270 
right now let's put the AH gonna put the
water<00:01:38.549> in<00:01:38.700> later<00:01:39.470> right<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:40.650> let's<00:01:40.829> set<00:01:41.009> up<00:01:41.040> the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
water in later right so let's set up the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.999 
water in later right so let's set up the
button<00:01:42.079> section<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.619> they're<00:01:43.770> all<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.979> way

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
button section so they're all the way

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.819 
button section so they're all the way
across<00:01:44.509> you<00:01:45.509> can<00:01:45.630> go<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:46.200> up<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.649> can<00:01:46.770> have

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
across you can go to up so you can have

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.030 
across you can go to up so you can have
a<00:01:46.890> sign<00:01:47.189> on<00:01:47.220> top<00:01:47.700> as<00:01:47.909> well<00:01:48.200> so<00:01:49.200> it's<00:01:49.380> good<00:01:49.710> so

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
a sign on top as well so it's good so

people know what they're buying ours no

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.200 
people know what they're buying ours no
buttons<00:01:52.500> that's<00:01:52.740> what<00:01:54.770> I'll<00:01:55.770> get<00:01:56.040> some<00:01:56.280> signs

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
buttons that's what I'll get some signs

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.749 
buttons that's what I'll get some signs
later<00:01:57.590> so<00:01:58.590> then<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.829> get<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.009> go<00:01:59.070> behind<00:01:59.340> and

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
later so then you get to go behind and

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.670 
later so then you get to go behind and
we<00:02:00.000> can<00:02:00.180> do<00:02:00.299> this<00:02:00.420> you're<00:02:00.600> going<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.840> put<00:02:01.619> the

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
we can do this you're going to put the

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.030 
we can do this you're going to put the
water<00:02:01.829> in<00:02:02.040> now<00:02:03.530> and<00:02:04.530> you're<00:02:04.649> gonna<00:02:04.740> get<00:02:04.890> the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
water in now and you're gonna get the

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.709 
water in now and you're gonna get the
your<00:02:05.579> block<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.060> you're<00:02:06.180> gonna<00:02:06.270> put<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.540> two

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
your block and you're gonna put it two

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.630 
your block and you're gonna put it two
out<00:02:06.840> there<00:02:06.990> on<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.439> loop<00:02:07.770> on<00:02:07.979> every<00:02:08.280> single<00:02:08.429> one

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
out there on a loop on every single one

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.600 
out there on a loop on every single one
that<00:02:08.879> has<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.750> dispenser<00:02:10.259> on<00:02:10.289> hey<00:02:11.039> good<00:02:11.220> well<00:02:11.400> on

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
that has a dispenser on hey good well on

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.370 
that has a dispenser on hey good well on
top<00:02:11.849> and<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.180> get<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.510> repeater

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
top and you get a repeater

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.460 
top and you get a repeater
you<00:02:13.470> gonna<00:02:13.560> put<00:02:13.770> one<00:02:13.890> on<00:02:14.040> top<00:02:15.290> like<00:02:16.290> that<00:02:16.350> and

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
you gonna put one on top like that and

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.930 
you gonna put one on top like that and
then<00:02:16.680> I'm<00:02:16.740> going<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.890> put<00:02:17.010> three<00:02:17.220> out<00:02:17.430> like

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
then I'm going to put three out like

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:18.290 
then I'm going to put three out like
this

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
this

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.420 
this
and<00:02:18.420> you're<00:02:18.540> going<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.690> set<00:02:18.930> these<00:02:19.170> two<00:02:19.410> on<00:02:19.650> two

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
and you're going to set these two on two

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.530 
and you're going to set these two on two
for<00:02:21.120> ticks

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
for ticks

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.520 
for ticks
and<00:02:21.690> this<00:02:22.050> one<00:02:22.260> on<00:02:22.290> nothing<00:02:22.980> so<00:02:24.350> do<00:02:25.350> that<00:02:25.470> for

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
and this one on nothing so do that for

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:37.040 
and this one on nothing so do that for
every<00:02:25.770> single<00:02:25.860> one<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:35.480> then<00:02:36.480> we<00:02:36.600> can<00:02:36.780> do<00:02:36.900> is

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
every single one and then we can do is

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.350 
every single one and then we can do is
gonna<00:02:37.170> connect<00:02:37.890> them<00:02:38.070> war<00:02:38.340> at<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.700> end<00:02:39.000> with

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
gonna connect them war at the end with

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.800 
gonna connect them war at the end with
bread<00:02:39.690> stone<00:02:40.020> and<00:02:41.300> then<00:02:42.300> you're<00:02:42.510> going<00:02:42.690> to

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
bread stone and then you're going to

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.430 
bread stone and then you're going to
make<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.680> first<00:02:44.040> push<00:02:44.610> piston<00:02:45.300> so<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.350> gonna

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
make the first push piston so you gonna

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.870 
make the first push piston so you gonna
pick<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.680> piston<00:02:47.070> on<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.190> second<00:02:47.550> block<00:02:47.670> here

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
pick a piston on the second block here

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.250 
pick a piston on the second block here
and<00:02:48.090> then<00:02:48.390> you<00:02:48.480> put<00:02:48.690> another<00:02:48.720> block<00:02:49.020> back

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
and then you put another block back

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.520 
and then you put another block back
there<00:02:49.760> simple<00:02:50.760> as<00:02:50.880> that

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
there simple as that

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.740 
there simple as that
so<00:02:52.530> now<00:02:52.740> we're<00:02:53.520> going<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:53.820> add<00:02:54.180> some<00:02:54.390> repeaters

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
so now we're going to add some repeaters

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.170 
so now we're going to add some repeaters
so<00:02:55.290> it's<00:02:55.950> got<00:02:56.130> big<00:02:56.310> delay<00:02:56.640> and<00:02:56.970> you<00:02:57.000> gotta

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
so it's got big delay and you gotta

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.830 
so it's got big delay and you gotta
city's<00:02:57.450> all<00:02:57.600> on<00:02:57.720> four<00:03:01.130> yes<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.660> now<00:03:03.660> what

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
city's all on four yes and now what

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.570 
city's all on four yes and now what
we're<00:03:03.960> going<00:03:04.080> to<00:03:04.110> do<00:03:04.260> is<00:03:04.440> we're<00:03:04.710> going<00:03:04.740> to<00:03:05.100> dig

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
we're going to do is we're going to dig

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.580 
we're going to do is we're going to dig
down<00:03:05.820> at<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.330> end<00:03:06.480> on<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.840> end<00:03:07.170> of<00:03:07.290> this<00:03:07.410> one

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
down at the end on the end of this one

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.440 
down at the end on the end of this one
and<00:03:08.160> you<00:03:08.250> go<00:03:08.340> down<00:03:08.520> one<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:08.970> you're<00:03:09.270> going<00:03:09.390> to

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
and you go down one and you're going to

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.770 
and you go down one and you're going to
go<00:03:09.540> down<00:03:10.110> two<00:03:10.350> and<00:03:10.770> then<00:03:10.860> down<00:03:11.010> three<00:03:11.660> you<00:03:12.660> just

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
go down two and then down three you just

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.290 
go down two and then down three you just
replace<00:03:13.110> that<00:03:13.320> pit<00:03:13.590> I<00:03:13.920> think<00:03:14.910> I've<00:03:15.060> gone<00:03:15.210> along

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
replace that pit I think I've gone along

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.160 
replace that pit I think I've gone along
eight<00:03:15.600> go<00:03:16.140> along<00:03:16.350> eight<00:03:17.060> five<00:03:18.060> six

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
eight go along eight five six

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.950 
eight go along eight five six
that's<00:03:19.920> five<00:03:20.130> action<00:03:20.580> so<00:03:21.180> then<00:03:21.360> this<00:03:21.720> block

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
that's five action so then this block

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.480 
that's five action so then this block
here's<00:03:22.200> a<00:03:22.260> bit<00:03:22.380> annoying<00:03:22.560> let's<00:03:22.890> go<00:03:22.980> back<00:03:23.190> I

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
here's a bit annoying let's go back I

here's a bit annoying let's go back I
want<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.180> block<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.540> water<00:03:24.690> flow<00:03:24.990> so<00:03:25.200> that

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.210 
want to block the water flow so that

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:31.370 
want to block the water flow so that
none<00:03:27.210> of<00:03:27.300> my<00:03:27.360> redstone<00:03:27.600> gets<00:03:28.050> flooded<00:03:30.380> six

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
none of my redstone gets flooded six

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.490 
none of my redstone gets flooded six
