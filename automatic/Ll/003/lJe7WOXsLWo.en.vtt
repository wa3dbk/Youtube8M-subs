in<00:00:08.930> this<00:00:09.139> video<00:00:09.469> I'm<00:00:09.559> going<00:00:09.710> to<00:00:09.769> show<00:00:09.980> how

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
in this video I'm going to show how

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.379 
in this video I'm going to show how
your<00:00:11.009> do-it-yourself<00:00:11.700> rocket<00:00:11.849> stove<00:00:12.299> into<00:00:12.690> a

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:13.389 
your do-it-yourself rocket stove into a

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:19.650 
your do-it-yourself rocket stove into a
fairly<00:00:13.990> safe<00:00:14.230> water<00:00:14.559> heater<00:00:18.060> alright<00:00:19.060> so<00:00:19.360> here

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 
fairly safe water heater alright so here

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.470 
fairly safe water heater alright so here
is<00:00:19.689> how<00:00:20.170> I've<00:00:20.830> made<00:00:21.189> this<00:00:21.460> micro<00:00:21.970> hot<00:00:22.270> water

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
is how I've made this micro hot water

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.100 
is how I've made this micro hot water
heater

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.110 
heater

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.560 
heater
I<00:00:23.140> took<00:00:23.860> some<00:00:24.160> quarter<00:00:24.550> inch<00:00:24.669> outer<00:00:24.970> diameter

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 
I took some quarter inch outer diameter

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.800 
I took some quarter inch outer diameter
tubing<00:00:26.380> and<00:00:26.700> I<00:00:27.700> wanted<00:00:28.150> this<00:00:28.270> was<00:00:28.480> just<00:00:28.660> some

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
tubing and I wanted this was just some

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.150 
tubing and I wanted this was just some
scrap<00:00:29.079> tubing<00:00:29.500> you'd<00:00:29.680> probably<00:00:29.829> get<00:00:30.040> better

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
scrap tubing you'd probably get better

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.760 
scrap tubing you'd probably get better
results<00:00:30.579> with<00:00:30.700> more<00:00:30.939> tubing<00:00:31.360> as<00:00:32.320> you<00:00:32.529> can<00:00:32.649> see

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
results with more tubing as you can see

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.110 
results with more tubing as you can see
it's<00:00:32.950> just<00:00:34.140> pushed<00:00:35.140> through<00:00:35.320> that<00:00:35.790> coal<00:00:36.790> and

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
it's just pushed through that coal and

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.440 
it's just pushed through that coal and
then<00:00:37.270> I<00:00:37.540> cut<00:00:38.530> and<00:00:38.800> add<00:00:39.190> a<00:00:39.399> little<00:00:39.730> support<00:00:40.149> with

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
then I cut and add a little support with

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.139 
then I cut and add a little support with
the<00:00:40.660> scrap<00:00:41.050> pieces<00:00:41.260> of<00:00:41.410> can<00:00:41.710> to<00:00:42.670> hold<00:00:42.850> it<00:00:43.000> in

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149 
the scrap pieces of can to hold it in

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.190 
the scrap pieces of can to hold it in
place<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:45.180> he<00:00:46.180> just<00:00:46.210> Rises<00:00:46.780> up<00:00:46.930> in<00:00:47.079> there

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 
place and he just Rises up in there

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.990 
place and he just Rises up in there
heats<00:00:47.410> up<00:00:47.560> the<00:00:47.740> interiors<00:00:48.160> base<00:00:48.460> and<00:00:48.700> exhaust

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
heats up the interiors base and exhaust

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.410 
heats up the interiors base and exhaust
through<00:00:49.240> all<00:00:49.630> these<00:00:50.020> holes<00:00:50.290> that<00:00:50.470> are<00:00:51.420> around

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
through all these holes that are around

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.910 
through all these holes that are around
this<00:00:52.600> this<00:00:52.870> actually<00:00:53.079> kind<00:00:53.500> of<00:00:53.560> creates<00:00:53.829> a

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
this this actually kind of creates a

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.870 
this this actually kind of creates a
space<00:00:54.190> heater<00:00:54.430> as<00:00:54.670> well<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.829> when<00:00:57.130> it's<00:00:57.310> being

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880 
space heater as well so when it's being

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.970 
space heater as well so when it's being
used<00:00:58.239> it<00:00:58.960> will<00:00:59.140> simply<00:00:59.500> be<00:00:59.710> placed<00:01:00.239> on<00:01:01.239> top

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
used it will simply be placed on top

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.829 
used it will simply be placed on top
water<00:01:02.980> be<00:01:03.310> pumped<00:01:03.640> in<00:01:03.760> one<00:01:04.000> side<00:01:04.239> and<00:01:04.449> be

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
water be pumped in one side and be

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.480 
water be pumped in one side and be
forced<00:01:05.140> out<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.530> other<00:01:05.710> and<00:01:06.100> get<00:01:06.220> this<00:01:06.310> off

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
forced out the other and get this off

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.910 
forced out the other and get this off
there<00:01:06.729> before<00:01:07.030> it<00:01:07.090> gets<00:01:07.240> too<00:01:07.420> hot<00:01:07.829> so<00:01:08.829> I'm

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
there before it gets too hot so I'm

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.530 
there before it gets too hot so I'm
gonna<00:01:09.009> get<00:01:09.159> the<00:01:09.250> water<00:01:09.430> set<00:01:09.759> up<00:01:09.909> and<00:01:10.149> we'll<00:01:10.360> see

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
gonna get the water set up and we'll see

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.359 
gonna get the water set up and we'll see
how<00:01:10.689> this<00:01:10.810> works<00:01:13.710> alright<00:01:14.710> so<00:01:14.950> as<00:01:15.100> you<00:01:15.159> can<00:01:15.280> see

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
how this works alright so as you can see

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.600 
how this works alright so as you can see
here<00:01:15.729> I've<00:01:15.850> got<00:01:15.909> fired<00:01:16.299> on<00:01:16.950> I've<00:01:17.950> got<00:01:18.310> a<00:01:18.340> piece

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
here I've got fired on I've got a piece

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.810 
here I've got fired on I've got a piece
of<00:01:18.640> stainless<00:01:19.240> steel<00:01:19.710> wool<00:01:20.710> our<00:01:21.340> stainless

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
of stainless steel wool our stainless

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.580 
of stainless steel wool our stainless
steel<00:01:22.000> scrubber<00:01:22.330> pad<00:01:22.600> that's<00:01:22.990> pushed<00:01:23.350> down

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
steel scrubber pad that's pushed down

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.580 
steel scrubber pad that's pushed down
into<00:01:23.979> the<00:01:24.299> secondary<00:01:25.299> air<00:01:25.600> intake<00:01:26.049> to<00:01:26.290> act<00:01:26.409> as

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
into the secondary air intake to act as

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.980 
into the secondary air intake to act as
a<00:01:26.620> heat<00:01:26.890> exchanger<00:01:27.570> helps<00:01:28.570> increase<00:01:28.750> the

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
a heat exchanger helps increase the

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.399 
a heat exchanger helps increase the
temperature<00:01:29.979> of<00:01:30.100> the<00:01:30.250> air<00:01:30.369> coming<00:01:30.400> in<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:32.290> I'm

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
temperature of the air coming in so I'm

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:33.750 
temperature of the air coming in so I'm
doing<00:01:32.530> some<00:01:32.770> tests<00:01:32.979> on<00:01:33.100> that<00:01:33.280> see<00:01:33.520> if<00:01:33.610> it

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
doing some tests on that see if it

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.140 
doing some tests on that see if it
improves<00:01:34.060> the<00:01:34.330> efficiency<00:01:34.540> of<00:01:34.900> the<00:01:35.049> stove<00:01:35.380> any

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
improves the efficiency of the stove any

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.899 
improves the efficiency of the stove any
and<00:01:37.150> then<00:01:37.450> as<00:01:37.630> you<00:01:37.780> can<00:01:37.869> see<00:01:38.049> here<00:01:38.670> we've<00:01:39.670> got

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
and then as you can see here we've got

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.789 
and then as you can see here we've got
the<00:01:40.060> little<00:01:40.350> canned<00:01:41.350> setup<00:01:43.439> see<00:01:44.439> the<00:01:44.530> flames

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
the little canned setup see the flames

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.210 
the little canned setup see the flames
inside<00:01:45.070> there<00:01:46.170> which<00:01:47.170> heats<00:01:47.530> up<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:47.890> water<00:01:48.130> in

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
inside there which heats up the water in

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.969 
inside there which heats up the water in
the<00:01:48.430> copper<00:01:48.760> tube<00:01:49.229> which<00:01:50.229> I<00:01:50.350> have<00:01:50.530> going<00:01:50.740> in

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
the copper tube which I have going in

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.560 
the copper tube which I have going in
here<00:01:51.280> sorry<00:01:51.640> about<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:51.909> dirty<00:01:52.150> water

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
here sorry about the dirty water

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.760 
here sorry about the dirty water
I<00:01:54.240> had<00:01:55.240> uses<00:01:55.600> copper<00:01:55.780> tubing<00:01:56.259> for<00:01:56.500> some

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
I had uses copper tubing for some

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.130 
I had uses copper tubing for some
gasification<00:01:57.640> experiments<00:01:58.330> there's<00:01:59.049> a

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
gasification experiments there's a

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.480 
gasification experiments there's a
little<00:01:59.350> bit<00:01:59.470> of<00:01:59.530> crud<00:01:59.740> but<00:01:59.950> you<00:02:00.070> can<00:02:00.189> see<00:02:00.340> it's

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
little bit of crud but you can see it's

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.120 
little bit of crud but you can see it's
circulating<00:02:01.090> here<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:02.590> my<00:02:02.770> battery's

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
circulating here and my battery's

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.070 
circulating here and my battery's
getting<00:02:03.400> low<00:02:03.549> some<00:02:03.909> put<00:02:04.210> this<00:02:04.330> on<00:02:04.540> the<00:02:04.630> charger

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
getting low some put this on the charger

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.590 
getting low some put this on the charger
for<00:02:05.259> a<00:02:05.320> second<00:02:05.799> and<00:02:06.220> we'll<00:02:07.030> see<00:02:07.180> how<00:02:07.299> long<00:02:07.450> it

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
for a second and we'll see how long it

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.919 
for a second and we'll see how long it
takes<00:02:07.630> for<00:02:07.960> it<00:02:07.990> to<00:02:08.049> get<00:02:08.229> warm<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:10.509> we'll<00:02:10.810> be

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
takes for it to get warm so we'll be

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.220 
takes for it to get warm so we'll be
right<00:02:11.140> back

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.229 

all<00:02:16.920> right<00:02:17.220> I<00:02:17.250> hope<00:02:17.489> my<00:02:17.670> batteries<00:02:18.090> will

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
all right I hope my batteries will

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.880 
all right I hope my batteries will
forgive<00:02:18.599> me<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:18.780> put<00:02:19.019> them<00:02:19.140> on<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.349> charger<00:02:19.709> for

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
forgive me I put them on the charger for

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.619 
forgive me I put them on the charger for
about<00:02:20.099> five<00:02:20.310> minutes<00:02:20.580> so<00:02:21.379> I<00:02:22.379> can<00:02:22.530> continue

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
about five minutes so I can continue

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.229 
about five minutes so I can continue
filming<00:02:24.629> this<00:02:25.280> but<00:02:26.280> as<00:02:26.459> you<00:02:26.489> can<00:02:26.760> see<00:02:26.819> in<00:02:27.120> the

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
filming this but as you can see in the

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.949 
filming this but as you can see in the
five<00:02:27.480> minutes<00:02:27.629> time<00:02:29.209> this<00:02:30.209> water<00:02:30.480> is<00:02:30.629> heated

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
five minutes time this water is heated

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.780 
five minutes time this water is heated
up<00:02:31.019> nicely<00:02:31.500> I'm<00:02:31.620> left<00:02:31.830> that<00:02:31.980> tubing<00:02:32.400> out<00:02:32.580> so

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
up nicely I'm left that tubing out so

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.350 
up nicely I'm left that tubing out so
you<00:02:32.879> can<00:02:33.030> see<00:02:33.239> indeed<00:02:34.019> that<00:02:34.049> is<00:02:34.349> circulating

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
you can see indeed that is circulating

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.949 
you can see indeed that is circulating
it's<00:02:36.360> about<00:02:36.590> 124<00:02:37.590> 125<00:02:38.519> degrees<00:02:38.940> within<00:02:39.629> 5

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
it's about 124 125 degrees within 5

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.110 
it's about 124 125 degrees within 5
minutes<00:02:41.120> it's<00:02:42.120> pretty<00:02:42.420> reasonable<00:02:43.790> and<00:02:44.790> again

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
minutes it's pretty reasonable and again

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.890 
minutes it's pretty reasonable and again
you<00:02:45.299> can<00:02:45.420> see<00:02:45.629> in<00:02:45.780> there<00:02:47.510> rocket<00:02:48.510> stove<00:02:48.720> is

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
you can see in there rocket stove is

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.280 
you can see in there rocket stove is
functionally<00:02:49.440> great<00:02:50.720> so<00:02:51.720> I'm<00:02:51.989> going<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.200> leave

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
functionally great so I'm going to leave

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.170 
functionally great so I'm going to leave
this<00:02:52.440> on<00:02:52.650> some<00:02:52.890> more<00:02:53.129> we'll<00:02:53.370> see<00:02:53.579> what<00:02:53.970> kind<00:02:54.090> of

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
this on some more we'll see what kind of

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.729 
this on some more we'll see what kind of
temperature<00:02:54.569> we<00:02:54.690> get<00:02:54.840> up<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:57.530> alright<00:02:58.530> now

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
temperature we get up to alright now

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.910 
temperature we get up to alright now
I've<00:02:58.920> had<00:02:59.069> this<00:02:59.220> running<00:02:59.549> for<00:02:59.760> about<00:03:00.180> an<00:03:00.450> hour

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
I've had this running for about an hour

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.479 
I've had this running for about an hour
and<00:03:01.920> as<00:03:02.190> we<00:03:02.340> see<00:03:02.549> it's<00:03:02.730> going<00:03:02.970> well<00:03:04.250> it<00:03:05.250> doesn't

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
and as we see it's going well it doesn't

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.819 
and as we see it's going well it doesn't
choke<00:03:05.849> itself<00:03:06.329> out<00:03:06.540> I've<00:03:06.780> burned<00:03:07.349> this<00:03:07.590> for

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
choke itself out I've burned this for

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.289 
choke itself out I've burned this for
hours<00:03:08.340> on<00:03:08.670> end<00:03:09.680> total<00:03:10.680> use<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.549> I've<00:03:12.150> never

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
hours on end total use and I've never

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:13.940 
hours on end total use and I've never
had<00:03:12.569> the<00:03:12.690> fire<00:03:12.870> choke<00:03:13.140> itself<00:03:13.319> out<00:03:13.709> it

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
had the fire choke itself out it

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.420 
had the fire choke itself out it
produces<00:03:14.640> very<00:03:14.670> fine<00:03:15.269> ash<00:03:15.569> it<00:03:16.410> slips<00:03:16.890> down<00:03:17.129> in

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
produces very fine ash it slips down in

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.780 
produces very fine ash it slips down in
there<00:03:17.670> between<00:03:17.849> that<00:03:18.150> heat<00:03:18.599> exchange<00:03:19.790> area

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
there between that heat exchange area

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.490 
there between that heat exchange area
and<00:03:21.269> where<00:03:21.419> the<00:03:21.510> fire<00:03:21.690> is<00:03:21.810> actually<00:03:22.169> taking

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
and where the fire is actually taking

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.559 
and where the fire is actually taking
place<00:03:22.549> so<00:03:23.549> I've<00:03:23.639> been<00:03:23.790> very<00:03:23.970> impressed<00:03:24.389> with

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
place so I've been very impressed with

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.390 
place so I've been very impressed with
this<00:03:24.889> now<00:03:25.889> if<00:03:26.489> you<00:03:26.669> look<00:03:26.880> closely<00:03:27.180> here<00:03:28.400> you'll

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
this now if you look closely here you'll

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.759 
this now if you look closely here you'll
see<00:03:29.700> I<00:03:29.730> had<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.150> add<00:03:30.389> a<00:03:30.419> clamp<00:03:30.870> I<00:03:31.260> was<00:03:31.530> having

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
see I had to add a clamp I was having

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.180 
see I had to add a clamp I was having
problems<00:03:31.919> with<00:03:32.250> water<00:03:32.639> getting<00:03:33.090> in<00:03:34.190> through

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
problems with water getting in through

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.490 
problems with water getting in through
there<00:03:35.489> so<00:03:35.790> clamping<00:03:36.450> off<00:03:36.569> the<00:03:36.810> intake<00:03:37.169> side

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
there so clamping off the intake side

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.210 
there so clamping off the intake side
seems<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:38.609> worked<00:03:38.849> very<00:03:39.209> nicely<00:03:40.010> you'll<00:03:41.010> also

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
seems to worked very nicely you'll also

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.979 
seems to worked very nicely you'll also
see<00:03:41.579> in<00:03:41.730> that<00:03:41.849> time<00:03:42.120> I<00:03:42.150> went<00:03:42.480> ahead<00:03:42.540> and<00:03:42.870> added

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
see in that time I went ahead and added

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.599 
see in that time I went ahead and added
a<00:03:43.109> bunch<00:03:43.290> more<00:03:43.410> water<00:03:44.419> and<00:03:45.419> as<00:03:45.540> a<00:03:45.690> safety<00:03:46.019> note

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
a bunch more water and as a safety note

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:50.629 
a bunch more water and as a safety note
you<00:03:47.609> can<00:03:47.730> see<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:48.000> pump<00:03:48.209> in<00:03:48.359> there<00:03:48.510> to<00:03:49.639> see

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
you can see the pump in there to see

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.640 
you can see the pump in there to see
right<00:03:50.819> down<00:03:51.030> in<00:03:51.180> there<00:03:51.419> just<00:03:52.169> a<00:03:52.319> simple

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
right down in there just a simple

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.280 
right down in there just a simple
12-volt<00:03:53.310> circulator<00:03:54.060> pump<00:03:54.359> uses<00:03:54.930> very<00:03:55.200> little

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
12-volt circulator pump uses very little

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.129 
12-volt circulator pump uses very little
powers<00:03:55.799> very<00:03:56.130> quiet<00:03:56.519> as<00:03:56.669> you<00:03:56.790> could<00:03:56.940> tell<00:03:57.139> but

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
powers very quiet as you could tell but

00:03:58.139 --> 00:03:59.449 
powers very quiet as you could tell but
notice<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:58.560> temperature<00:03:59.010> seems<00:03:59.310> to<00:03:59.400> be

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
notice the temperature seems to be

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.300 
notice the temperature seems to be
holding<00:03:59.700> real<00:04:00.030> steady<00:04:00.329> about<00:04:00.629> 140<00:04:01.319> 546

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
holding real steady about 140 546

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.430 
holding real steady about 140 546
degrees<00:04:03.230> so<00:04:04.230> from<00:04:04.530> a<00:04:04.620> safety<00:04:04.859> standpoint<00:04:06.440> this

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
degrees so from a safety standpoint this

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.970 
degrees so from a safety standpoint this
seems<00:04:07.769> to<00:04:07.919> work<00:04:08.099> really<00:04:08.280> well<00:04:09.650> seems<00:04:10.650> to<00:04:10.859> have

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
seems to work really well seems to have

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.390 
seems to work really well seems to have
reached<00:04:11.190> its<00:04:11.489> limit<00:04:11.940> for<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:13.190> conditions<00:04:14.190> in

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
reached its limit for the conditions in

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.849 
reached its limit for the conditions in
its<00:04:14.549> environment<00:04:14.849> perhaps<00:04:15.560> excuse<00:04:16.560> me<00:04:16.680> if<00:04:16.769> the

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
its environment perhaps excuse me if the

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.080 
its environment perhaps excuse me if the
temperature<00:04:17.220> is<00:04:17.280> a<00:04:17.340> little<00:04:17.400> higher<00:04:17.729> in<00:04:17.880> here

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
temperature is a little higher in here

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.900 
temperature is a little higher in here
it<00:04:18.209> would<00:04:18.389> be<00:04:18.419> a<00:04:18.539> different<00:04:18.840> story<00:04:19.910> you'll

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
it would be a different story you'll

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.430 
it would be a different story you'll
notice<00:04:21.239> the<00:04:21.329> temperature<00:04:21.720> at<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:21.930> top<00:04:22.139> based

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
notice the temperature at the top based

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.070 
notice the temperature at the top based
off<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:22.740> color<00:04:22.919> of<00:04:23.039> the<00:04:23.099> can<00:04:23.310> is<00:04:23.460> much<00:04:23.729> higher

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
off the color of the can is much higher

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.719 
off the color of the can is much higher
than<00:04:25.080> at<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:25.289> bottom<00:04:25.530> so<00:04:25.919> if<00:04:26.010> you<00:04:26.130> did<00:04:26.460> need<00:04:26.669> a

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
than at the bottom so if you did need a

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:28.730 
than at the bottom so if you did need a
higher<00:04:27.000> temperature<00:04:27.390> putting<00:04:28.200> it<00:04:28.289> up<00:04:28.409> higher

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
higher temperature putting it up higher

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.600 
higher temperature putting it up higher
with<00:04:29.010> probably

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
with probably

rocket stove heater about Chris out and
things<00:04:39.389> like<00:04:39.539> that<00:04:39.599> you<00:04:40.050> got<00:04:40.229> to<00:04:40.349> understand

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
things like that you got to understand

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.040 
things like that you got to understand

the temperature's involved in rocket
stove<00:04:43.259> combustion<00:04:43.979> is<00:04:44.189> much<00:04:44.460> higher<00:04:44.729> than

00:04:44.929 --> 00:04:44.939 
stove combustion is much higher than

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
that of a traditional wood stove I'll

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:49.249 
that of a traditional wood stove I'll
show<00:04:47.849> you<00:04:47.909> what<00:04:48.120> does<00:04:48.389> happen<00:04:48.840> you<00:04:48.960> may<00:04:49.139> have

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:49.259 
show you what does happen you may have

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:52.339 
show you what does happen you may have
heard<00:04:49.409> this<00:04:49.590> little<00:04:49.770> hissing<00:04:50.219> sound<00:04:50.550> you<00:04:51.349> will

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:52.349 
heard this little hissing sound you will

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:54.679 
heard this little hissing sound you will
actually<00:04:52.620> get<00:04:53.039> water<00:04:53.370> which<00:04:54.210> is<00:04:54.389> one<00:04:54.539> the

00:04:54.679 --> 00:04:54.689 
actually get water which is one the

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:57.909 
actually get water which is one the
exhaust<00:04:54.960> components<00:04:55.620> that<00:04:55.800> will<00:04:55.979> condense<00:04:56.370> on

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
exhaust components that will condense on

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.800 
exhaust components that will condense on
those<00:04:58.919> tubes<00:04:59.310> but<00:04:59.969> you'll<00:05:00.150> notice<00:05:00.509> there's<00:05:00.689> no

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
those tubes but you'll notice there's no

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.719 
those tubes but you'll notice there's no
creosote<00:05:01.229> there's<00:05:01.409> a<00:05:01.469> little<00:05:01.710> soot<00:05:01.979> buildup

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
creosote there's a little soot buildup

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.779 
creosote there's a little soot buildup
but<00:05:02.940> no<00:05:03.060> creosote<00:05:03.569> buildup<00:05:04.430> so<00:05:05.430> again<00:05:05.639> this

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:05.789 
but no creosote buildup so again this

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:09.170 
but no creosote buildup so again this
design<00:05:06.210> is<00:05:06.360> fairly<00:05:07.669> fairly<00:05:08.669> safe<00:05:08.940> you<00:05:09.150> don't

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
design is fairly fairly safe you don't

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.369 
design is fairly fairly safe you don't
have<00:05:09.389> to<00:05:09.509> worry<00:05:09.659> about<00:05:09.719> that<00:05:10.020> chimney

00:05:10.369 --> 00:05:10.379 
have to worry about that chimney

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:11.240 
have to worry about that chimney
blocking<00:05:10.800> up

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
blocking up

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.070 
blocking up
worst-case<00:05:11.940> scenario<00:05:12.060> you're<00:05:12.719> going<00:05:12.870> to<00:05:12.930> get

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
worst-case scenario you're going to get

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.930 
worst-case scenario you're going to get
a<00:05:13.110> little<00:05:13.289> soot<00:05:13.590> which<00:05:13.860> might<00:05:14.159> decrease<00:05:14.789> your

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
a little soot which might decrease your

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.330 
a little soot which might decrease your
heat<00:05:15.150> transfer<00:05:15.330> by<00:05:15.810> some<00:05:18.080> so<00:05:19.080> I<00:05:19.409> hope<00:05:20.159> this

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
heat transfer by some so I hope this

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.990 
heat transfer by some so I hope this
little<00:05:20.610> micro<00:05:21.150> hot<00:05:21.629> water<00:05:21.810> heater<00:05:22.110> setup<00:05:22.529> has

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
little micro hot water heater setup has

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.659 
little micro hot water heater setup has
been<00:05:24.000> interesting<00:05:24.629> to<00:05:24.810> you<00:05:25.370> you<00:05:26.370> might<00:05:26.520> have

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
been interesting to you you might have

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:28.399 
been interesting to you you might have
some<00:05:26.819> practical<00:05:27.210> applications<00:05:27.810> for<00:05:28.020> that<00:05:28.050> I

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:28.409 
some practical applications for that I

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:30.800 
some practical applications for that I
can<00:05:28.860> think<00:05:28.979> of<00:05:29.159> quite<00:05:29.279> a<00:05:29.370> few<00:05:29.479> it's<00:05:30.479> just<00:05:30.689> a

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
can think of quite a few it's just a

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.939 
can think of quite a few it's just a
real<00:05:31.110> lightweight<00:05:31.469> easy<00:05:32.039> to<00:05:32.430> do<00:05:32.580> cheap<00:05:32.939> setup

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:33.949 
real lightweight easy to do cheap setup

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:36.320 
real lightweight easy to do cheap setup
so<00:05:34.949> as<00:05:35.279> always<00:05:35.490> thanks<00:05:35.940> for<00:05:35.969> watching<00:05:36.090> my
