ago<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:17.310> was<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.699> was<00:00:18.000> trying<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.449> get<00:00:18.660> that

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050

I needed something dirtier and I kind of
was<00:00:34.110> looking<00:00:34.320> for<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.890> sort<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.160> tonality<00:00:35.460> so

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
was looking for that sort of tonality so

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.930 
was looking for that sort of tonality so
I<00:00:36.300> designed<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.719> pedal<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.079> do<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.940> alright

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
I designed a pedal to do that alright

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.400 
I designed a pedal to do that alright
for<00:00:39.149> this<00:00:39.210> demonstration<00:00:39.480> we're<00:00:40.260> actually

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
generally want to leave the bass boost

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.320 
generally want to leave the bass boost
off<00:02:09.710> just<00:02:10.130> because<00:02:10.340> your<00:02:10.460> amps<00:02:10.760> moving<00:02:11.180> so

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
off just because your amps moving so

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.390 
off just because your amps moving so

going for was you know like an ac/dc
type<00:02:46.820> of<00:02:46.970> tone<00:02:47.120> when<00:02:47.270> I<00:02:47.330> was<00:02:47.480> first<00:02:47.690> designing

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
type of tone when I was first designing

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.470 
type of tone when I was first designing
it<00:02:48.350> the<00:02:49.160> song<00:02:49.340> I<00:02:49.370> had<00:02:49.610> in<00:02:49.730> my<00:02:49.790> mind<00:02:49.820> was<00:02:50.270> like<00:02:50.300> a

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
it the song I had in my mind was like a

00:02:50.480 --> 00:03:02.650 
it the song I had in my mind was like a
like<00:02:51.020> a<00:02:51.050> highway<00:02:51.230> to<00:02:51.440> hell<00:02:51.650> something<00:03:01.390> so<00:03:02.390> I

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
like a highway to hell something so I

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.240 
like a highway to hell something so I
mean<00:03:02.810> this<00:03:03.110> is<00:03:03.170> a<00:03:03.320> stress<00:03:03.650> it's<00:03:03.920> not<00:03:03.980> going<00:03:04.190> to

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
mean this is a stress it's not going to

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.940 
mean this is a stress it's not going to
