00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
cuts this way is because it doesn't

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.720 
cuts this way is because it doesn't
because<00:02:26.420> it<00:02:26.510> doesn't<00:02:26.810> shred<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.380> hair<00:02:27.640> if<00:02:28.640> I

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
because it doesn't shred the hair if I

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.670 
because it doesn't shred the hair if I
use<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.060> razor<00:02:29.270> on<00:02:29.569> the<00:02:29.690> inside<00:02:30.140> of<00:02:30.290> my<00:02:30.440> hand

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.230 

what's<00:03:51.740> nice<00:03:51.920> about<00:03:51.980> razoring<00:03:52.670> is<00:03:52.970> you<00:03:53.090> don't

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:53.240 
what's nice about razoring is you don't

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.000 
what's nice about razoring is you don't
have<00:03:53.360> to<00:03:53.480> go<00:03:53.600> back<00:03:53.750> and<00:03:54.050> texturize<00:03:54.680> it<00:03:54.710> too

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
have to go back and texturize it too

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.400 
have to go back and texturize it too

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
much because the texturising is done at

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.400 
much because the texturising is done at
the<00:03:57.500> same<00:03:57.680> time<00:03:57.980> the<00:03:58.400> cuts<00:03:58.640> is<00:03:58.850> getting<00:03:59.150> done

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.550
