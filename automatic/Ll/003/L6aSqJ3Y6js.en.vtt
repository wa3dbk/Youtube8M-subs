 yes 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.020
 very remarkable that I bring work 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:21.420

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.210

 if you want a next one let's put 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.269
 the 75 light 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:46.460

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:49.870
 We will percent minimum price we will 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.870
 to the bundesliga 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:01:00.280
 the maximum we put 400 coins 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.170
 and we will remember good and four 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.789
 coins 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.390
 let's find four coins for the 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:17.080
 shirts only 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:20.830
 black and 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.740
 white and black are the most 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.600
 suitable to sell after all 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.260
 you have to listen to it with the night about 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.830
 the nights boots 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:38.900
 easier to carry 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:38.900
 ways I have done it 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.890
 looking as you see 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.580
 here it takes us two quite a lot 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:54.840
 gates must push especially until 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:59.610
 the 850 so they hire because the 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:03.270
 I'm going to take with 44 to 900 because it 's 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:07.170
 truth that happens the 80 and 50 600 is 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:11.610
 ok 8 450 yes and this 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:24.660
 700 and here I do not know why it does not come out 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:28.489
 it came out nothing comes out but xx but let's 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.489
 try to add everything 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.600
 As you can see they are repeating T-shirts 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.890
 white 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.890
 and we are going to put everything 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.020
 webber when we have to send the 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.150
 they put credible lisbon when it lists 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.610
 transferable we can set an example 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.320
 now you when you hit buy the 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.320

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:58.160

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:02.240
 at that minimum price if we clicked 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:10.220

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:13.040
 same bbva coins and well buy already like this 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.260
 with all the shirts like that with shot 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.280
 how to put these referrals and let's go 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.280
 at the time we sell it 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.860
 well here we are already at the moment in 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.500
 the one that has sold almost everything today by a thousand 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:29.190

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.020
 thousand and 1100 these 3 black t-shirts we 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.870
 have sold the truth that costs the most 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.720
 black shirts that are sold I say 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:43.010
 that especially the white shirt are 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:43.010
 the ones that have the most effect 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.689
 because as you can see all white have been 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:55.280
 sold and that's the deal to buy the 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:56.990
 coin with a lot for 750 and 985 750 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.459
 and at least what minimum you can 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.680
 the truth but start looking for 460 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.990
 units you know white shirts a 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.700

 mop you can also take the 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.319
 any time and any day but 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.480
 especially during the week at night 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.700
 works better and good this is all that 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:18.680

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:22.070
