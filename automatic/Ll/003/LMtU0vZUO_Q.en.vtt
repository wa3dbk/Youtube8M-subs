 professional careers in the areas of 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.110

 social sciences 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.920
 Health 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.440
 and engineering 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:49.720
 art and humanities founded at the eaves of 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.840
 the university of chile- and with a strong 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.960
 emphasis on pedagogical training today 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.559
 the wide beach university is 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.620
 projects as an autonomous institution 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.410
 accredited and in permanent growth 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.890
 today there are 36 careers 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:14.290
 our university with more than 8,000 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:18.190
 400 academic students and 64 years of 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:21.190
 history we are a university that watches 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.490
 for quality public education that 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.470
 Chile needs 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.909
 good one of the reasons why I 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.950
 I decided to study at this university 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.210
 radiology in arts in social work 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.210
 that meets our sheet here 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.440
 is to study art in the uniqueness of the beach 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.740
 wide means to a certain extent 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.960
 approach the creative space from the 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.130
 freedom I consider it a good 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.369
 art step option 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.369
 yes 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:02:02.360
 not only be patient and their 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.369
 values like working as a team and not 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.960
 only with others but have then 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.960
 that integrating everyone else 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.340
 first I wanted to innovate with a career 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.530
 new and I always liked tourism and 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.230
 apart from the club learning two languages 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.150
 I liked it much more then that's why 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.300
 I chose tourist administration here in 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.300
 the u 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.810
 and I chose to study the gases 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.520
 differentials in the universe of brian k 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.950
 due to the curricular mesh that is 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.530
 delivery because not only combine 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.450
 theoretical parts those that do 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.580
 set by the practical part and who 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.860
 he knows the fundamental thing to be able to later 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.210
 work in the workplace 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.560
 of the environment that is within the 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.390
 university the closeness of that gives you 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.180
 together with the teachers I think that 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.829
 no other side we will find it 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.599
 study environmental engineering in the 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.609
 ultra that belongs to the department of 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.349
 environment in the first engineering 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:00.629
 that was created in the country of the 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.510
 specialty in a strong component in 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:05.310
 processes that is our students 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.129
 our future engineers in 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.950
 information in the treatment receipt 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:13.079
 solid and funny liquids what 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.959
 it has to do with natural resources what 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:19.640
 that has to do with energy the 72 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:22.610
 singles days and environmental management 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.980
 we in general have with our 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.880
 students I'm not talking about the body 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:31.810
 academic and a pretty relationship 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.270
 friendly collaboration 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.210
 and much more than really I think that 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.100
 this 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:41.720
 gives our student a very strong seal 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.720
 special in front of another university 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:49.280
 since I'm in school and the average 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:53.060
 one of my priorities was to get to the 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.970
 State university and thousands of reais 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.880
 were to study some pedagogy 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:01.370
 so I always always knew and 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.900
 training that this university was a 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.050
 of the best in terms of what is 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:09.370
 pedagogy then also my sister 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.370
 he also entered this university 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.799
 study the education career in base 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:18.120
 every convention and rurality in san 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:20.609
 felipe is simple because the only place 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.910
 in Chile and in Latin America nice 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.680
 rural basic education career that 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.840
 is focused precisely towards 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.840
 those people who wanted 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:39.280
 to pose a challenge also to those 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.280
 places that need it 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.520
 ah 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:05.680
 wide beach university valparaiso and 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.680
 san felipe dare to think
