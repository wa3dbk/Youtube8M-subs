00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
going back to this one because the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.979 
going back to this one because the
battery<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.219> hot<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.600> just<00:00:57.780> thought<00:00:57.899> I'd

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
battery is hot and I just thought I'd

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.900 
battery is hot and I just thought I'd
mention<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.500> because<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:59.129> might<00:00:59.340> notice<00:00:59.730> a

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
mention that because you might notice a

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.119 
mention that because you might notice a
difference<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.570> how<00:01:00.780> my<00:01:00.960> videos<00:01:01.109> look<00:01:01.680> from

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
difference in how my videos look from

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.680 
difference in how my videos look from
when<00:01:02.340> they<00:01:02.460> look<00:01:02.640> while<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.850> was<00:01:03.090> scrubbing<00:01:03.390> the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
when they look while I was scrubbing the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.260 
when they look while I was scrubbing the
the<00:01:04.619> old<00:01:05.159> paint<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.610> grease<00:01:05.850> off<00:01:06.060> that

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
the old paint and grease off that

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.210 
the old paint and grease off that
manifold<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.770> know<00:01:07.860> it's<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.070> good

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
manifold and you know it's a good

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.500 
manifold and you know it's a good
opportunity<00:01:08.490> for<00:01:08.850> me<00:01:09.140> to<00:01:10.729> you<00:01:11.729> know<00:01:11.760> see<00:01:12.119> how

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
opportunity for me to you know see how

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.820 
opportunity for me to you know see how
the<00:01:13.500> camera<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:15.000> cameras<00:01:15.509> compare<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.320> think

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
the camera the cameras compare I think

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.410 
the camera the cameras compare I think
this<00:01:17.009> one<00:01:17.189> definitely<00:01:17.610> has<00:01:17.700> better<00:01:18.090> sound

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
this one definitely has better sound

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.810 
this one definitely has better sound
also<00:01:19.170> as<00:01:19.500> far<00:01:19.650> as<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.830> quality<00:01:20.189> goes<00:01:20.460> I

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
also as far as the quality goes I

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.640 
also as far as the quality goes I
started<00:01:21.450> out<00:01:21.570> shooting<00:01:21.930> with<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:22.439> one<00:01:22.619> on

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
started out shooting with this one on

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.830 
started out shooting with this one on
the<00:01:22.799> highest<00:01:23.250> quality<00:01:23.670> that's<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.180> that's

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
the highest quality that's the that's

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.270 
the highest quality that's the that's
what<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.020> used<00:01:25.290> when<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.500> when<00:01:25.710> we<00:01:25.860> went<00:01:26.040> out<00:01:26.159> on

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
what I used when I when we went out on

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.310 
what I used when I when we went out on
the<00:01:26.369> boat<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.700> other<00:01:26.820> day<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:28.200> was

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
the boat the other day and that was

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.899 
the boat the other day and that was
great<00:01:28.650> but<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.950> took<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.130> really<00:01:29.280> long<00:01:29.369> time<00:01:29.729> to

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
great but it took a really long time to

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.760 
great but it took a really long time to
load<00:01:30.060> everything<00:01:30.570> then<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.290> went<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.619> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
load everything then I went to the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.649 
load everything then I went to the
lowest<00:01:32.130> quality<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.700> shot<00:01:32.880> some<00:01:33.090> videos<00:01:33.420> and

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
lowest quality and shot some videos and

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.090 
lowest quality and shot some videos and
I<00:01:33.720> noticed<00:01:34.079> when<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.560> was<00:01:34.710> looking<00:01:34.979> at

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
I noticed when I was looking at

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.679 
I noticed when I was looking at
something<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.490> was<00:01:35.579> far<00:01:35.820> off<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.420> was<00:01:36.509> all

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
something that was far off it was all

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.780 
something that was far off it was all
Wiggly<00:01:36.960> squiggly<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.220> went<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.430> like<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
Wiggly squiggly so I went to like the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.249 
Wiggly squiggly so I went to like the
medium<00:01:39.180> quality<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.689> that's<00:01:39.810> where<00:01:39.960> we're<00:01:40.110> at

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
medium quality and that's where we're at

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.840 
medium quality and that's where we're at
now<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:40.740> we're<00:01:40.890> gonna<00:01:40.979> see<00:01:41.250> this<00:01:41.430> one<00:01:41.610> takes<00:01:41.759> a

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
now so we're gonna see this one takes a

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.550 
now so we're gonna see this one takes a
little<00:01:42.030> longer<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.450> load<00:01:42.630> but<00:01:43.229> it's<00:01:43.409> not

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
little longer to load but it's not

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.410

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
dreadfully long and we'll see how the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.960 
dreadfully long and we'll see how the
quality<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:46.049> I'm<00:01:47.040> doing<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.280> lot<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.579> work<00:01:47.759> today

that you look at so it's a good

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.999 
that you look at so it's a good
opportunity<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.180> see<00:01:51.329> how<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.509> goes<00:01:52.009> okay

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
opportunity to see how that goes okay

that<00:03:09.940> manifold<00:03:10.450> was<00:03:10.630> to<00:03:10.870> see<00:03:11.770> how<00:03:11.890> much<00:03:12.070> paint

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340
