00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.940
 there is where everyone a little trick 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:16.150
 kama with christmas just you have who does 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.529
 so it's not very complicated during 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.210
 christmas there is a quest called 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.369
 estrie christmas so that's going to open 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.560
 you just have to enjoy it 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:27.940
 the opening to the opening you go 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:31.600
 type your items well dearly kind 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.879
 250000 not 2011 it's a landscape for 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.340
 a Christmas cape for example we go in 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:37.570
 put 5 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.980
 but it is an opinion that at the time of 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.829
 openings that it will cost dearly because 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:45.010
 between people will come back 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.170
 I'm going to put 5 I think it 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.460
 will leave 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.449
 no it's the first time I've 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.559
 do because there is not heard 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.170
 opening on the server apart 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:57.569
 today we are challenging 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.569
 we will see during the opening 6 to 0 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.150
 in Algeria five panels so I'm going 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.870
 unlock in addition the successes on my 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.690
 void so if it sells a joule say 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:14.460
 So not now we'll see her 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.370
 only two minutes but good found 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.770
 already that's his share so here's that aix is 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.119
 opening 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.740
 I'm waiting there I'm going fast to Iran 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.890
 welcome Christmas logs and I 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.890
 unlocked christmas city arguments 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.240
 so recoucou everyone as we 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.640
 see a great good so I avoid 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.910
 let's go back to the age of v and I'm going 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.850
 finish it on my best and then we'll go 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.560
 directly render paintings of deua 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.420
 match because I log them 25 on 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.470
 news i will do it on everyone 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.590
 decidedly at the mans for all the 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.590
 world 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:03.580
 by source if I was successful on the 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.940
 point messages sent a little too much 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.940
 it's for the moment 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.830
 I was going to death his daughter 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.660
 do you want to slip? 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.010
 so we'll put a little hat on 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:29.150
 a small motherboard 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.150
 we are all gone 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:38.760
 frankly this big fat bnf 250 zero 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.879
 while it costs me twenty thousand camin 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.340
 kraft and I think it's a very 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:49.290
 very nice trick of evil but not everything 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:52.530
 the time to recognize that there 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.489
 really share a basin but jean rachid 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.489
 apart that closes 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.819
 perfect to exceed 200 million 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.900
 quickly go 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.280
 art 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.000
 it still goes to this band will do the 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.810
 balance in the end how much did we do there with 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.490
 a single opening 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.490
 I was the only seller after 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.020
 we have people selling it four 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.290
 hundred hundred miles under its super 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.290
 expensive 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.540
 so we resume the video here 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.150
 as you see it is selling super 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.280
 comes someone wants to break the prices 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.989
 these words are already like a simple 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.480
 digress hop adds a small 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.549
 at the video I had forgotten to watch 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.959
 how many cases warrant me so here you go 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:14.379
 four million with the opening it 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.379
 represent 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.860
 32 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.750
 see this 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.980
 c was therefore these items were sold 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:30.990
 while 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:34.610
 francois henri pinault blowjob so it's 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.610
 not bad a dozen panels clippard 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.990
 by opening so I will continue to 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.540
 do that we hesitate to do it I hope 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:46.060
 you have not ruined my life but it's 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.060
 like that so here we go 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.560
 a signature in their ranks several 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.820
 so here we are going to finish canvases of geese 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.910
 wild but shhh 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.770
 first break 31 86 for in order to 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.430
 swamp 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.430
 Saturday 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.660
 and here we go 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.409

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:32.290
 we get together when I'm here and that's it 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:38.350
 I'm finally here so I'm going to him 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:41.400
 traded the 5 decoration I change 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.400
 your picture doll 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:53.900
 I think we must pay tribute 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:56.900
 see to whom we must 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:59.500

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:03.100
 who is here at the attitude of our breaks 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:05.990

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:08.820
 I think I answer you said I 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.470
 past 10 succeed me 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:14.200

 I finish my vigilante bard karin that 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.820
 in four days 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:26.620
 if I lie too much pop 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:29.190
 so it will still be 40 points 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.840
 well advanced but almost seen that 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:33.249
 it would be nice if I handle the vortex that 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.550
 I am worried 

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:36.980
 / 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:40.210
