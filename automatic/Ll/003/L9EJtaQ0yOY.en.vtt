and I like to keep that on camera RAW
especially<00:05:01.460> if<00:05:01.550> you<00:05:01.610> have<00:05:01.700> protein<00:05:02.060> on<00:05:02.180> well

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
especially if you have protein on well

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.730 
especially if you have protein on well
it's<00:05:02.690> the<00:05:02.780> only<00:05:02.930> way<00:05:03.020> you<00:05:03.080> got<00:05:03.560> to<00:05:03.650> have

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
it's the only way you got to have

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.290 
it's the only way you got to have
protein<00:05:03.919> on<00:05:04.220> to<00:05:04.370> use<00:05:04.490> counter<00:05:04.820> on<00:05:04.970> eHow<00:05:05.240> we

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
protein on to use counter on eHow we

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.080 
protein on to use counter on eHow we
know<00:05:05.570> that<00:05:05.810> so<00:05:06.140> so<00:05:07.070> let's<00:05:07.220> exit<00:05:07.580> out<00:05:07.669> we<00:05:07.910> just

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
know that so so let's exit out we just

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.510 
know that so so let's exit out we just
press<00:05:08.330> the<00:05:08.540> X<00:05:09.110> press<00:05:09.500> it<00:05:09.680> again<00:05:09.950> and<00:05:10.250> there<00:05:10.490> we

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
press the X press it again and there we

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.830 
press the X press it again and there we
are<00:05:10.640> back<00:05:10.940> to<00:05:11.479> our<00:05:12.320> preview<00:05:12.770> screen<00:05:13.840> so

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
are back to our preview screen so

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.890 
are back to our preview screen so
overall<00:05:15.110> it's<00:05:15.470> it's<00:05:16.310> a<00:05:16.460> great<00:05:16.669> little<00:05:16.900> $80

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
overall it's it's a great little $80

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.159 
overall it's it's a great little $80
add-on<00:05:18.320> I<00:05:18.560> wouldn't<00:05:19.130> run<00:05:19.669> without<00:05:19.850> it<00:05:20.060> and<00:05:20.360> the

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
add-on I wouldn't run without it and the

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:22.990 
add-on I wouldn't run without it and the
good<00:05:21.320> thing<00:05:21.470> about<00:05:21.500> this<00:05:21.950> is<00:05:22.280> it<00:05:22.550> just<00:05:22.669> doesn't

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
good thing about this is it just doesn't

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.909 
good thing about this is it just doesn't
add<00:05:23.120> any<00:05:23.300> more<00:05:24.020> thickness<00:05:24.470> than<00:05:24.680> the<00:05:24.800> old

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
add any more thickness than the old

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:31.030 
add any more thickness than the old
GoPro<00:05:26.470> which<00:05:27.470> is<00:05:27.650> nice<00:05:29.290> so<00:05:30.290> at<00:05:30.380> this<00:05:30.530> point<00:05:30.800> not

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040 
GoPro which is nice so at this point not

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.950 
GoPro which is nice so at this point not
adding<00:05:31.370> any<00:05:31.490> more<00:05:31.700> thickness<00:05:32.000> maybe<00:05:32.419> I<00:05:32.540> think

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
adding any more thickness maybe I think

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.930 
adding any more thickness maybe I think
they<00:05:33.080> could<00:05:33.290> make<00:05:33.320> a<00:05:33.500> backpack<00:05:34.100> a<00:05:34.460> battery

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
they could make a backpack a battery

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.360 
they could make a backpack a battery
backpack<00:05:35.419> that<00:05:35.750> would<00:05:35.960> go<00:05:36.770> in<00:05:36.860> between<00:05:37.010> this

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
backpack that would go in between this

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.400 
backpack that would go in between this
and<00:05:37.640> then<00:05:38.419> you're<00:05:38.540> going<00:05:38.630> to<00:05:38.690> go<00:05:38.840> back<00:05:39.020> to<00:05:39.290> the

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
and then you're going to go back to the

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.830 
and then you're going to go back to the
same<00:05:39.620> thickness<00:05:39.919> as<00:05:40.280> the<00:05:40.970> original<00:05:41.510> GoPro

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
same thickness as the original GoPro

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.060 
same thickness as the original GoPro
which<00:05:42.020> wouldn't<00:05:42.260> be<00:05:42.350> too<00:05:42.500> bad<00:05:42.530> because<00:05:42.919> we're

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
which wouldn't be too bad because we're

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.770 
which wouldn't be too bad because we're
kind<00:05:43.190> of<00:05:43.340> all<00:05:43.430> used<00:05:43.640> to<00:05:43.729> that<00:05:43.880> but<00:05:44.510> we'd<00:05:44.630> have

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
kind of all used to that but we'd have

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.219 
kind of all used to that but we'd have
an<00:05:44.870> extra<00:05:45.110> battery<00:05:45.290> now<00:05:45.650> on<00:05:45.860> there<00:05:46.370> so<00:05:47.229> yeah

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:48.229 
an extra battery now on there so yeah

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:49.960 
an extra battery now on there so yeah
just<00:05:48.560> just<00:05:48.800> a<00:05:48.890> thought<00:05:49.130> just<00:05:49.400> one<00:05:49.580> of<00:05:49.669> my<00:05:49.729> silly
