quite<00:00:23.699> often<00:00:23.880> valve<00:00:24.330> amps<00:00:24.660> are<00:00:24.869> but<00:00:25.680> these<00:00:25.800> are

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
quite often valve amps are but these are

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.529 
quite often valve amps are but these are
well<00:00:26.099> looked<00:00:26.250> after<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:27.090> they<00:00:27.300> should<00:00:27.510> be

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
well looked after so they should be

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.689 
well looked after so they should be
available<00:00:28.170> so<00:00:29.039> I'll<00:00:29.160> start<00:00:29.369> with<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.580> bottom

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
an original from 1987 but I had it

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.459 
an original from 1987 but I had it
recovered<00:00:41.670> where<00:00:42.120> I've<00:00:42.329> got<00:00:42.510> brand<00:00:43.020> new<00:00:43.110> toll

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469

axe<00:00:44.059> about<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.090> year<00:00:45.450> ago<00:00:45.480> because<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.110> managed

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
axe about a year ago because I managed

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.220 
axe about a year ago because I managed
to<00:00:46.559> spill<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.890> can<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.309> emulsion<00:00:47.850> over<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.329> also

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
to spill a can of emulsion over it also

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.549 
to spill a can of emulsion over it also
had<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.559> revolved<00:00:50.070> it's<00:00:50.760> got<00:00:50.940> al<00:00:51.180> 34s<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.440> they

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
had it revolved it's got al 34s and they

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.340 
had it revolved it's got al 34s and they
are<00:00:52.770> harmer<00:00:53.460> cryogenic<00:00:54.449> vowels<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.110> there

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
are harmer cryogenic vowels in there

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.830 
are harmer cryogenic vowels in there
this<00:00:56.219> amp<00:00:56.460> was<00:00:56.640> pretty<00:00:56.879> revolutionary<00:00:57.059> at<00:00:57.809> the

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
this amp was pretty revolutionary at the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.200 
this amp was pretty revolutionary at the
time<00:00:57.960> because<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.770> used<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.730> thing<00:00:59.969> called

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
time because it used the thing called

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.180 
time because it used the thing called
diode<00:01:00.629> clipping<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.379> help<00:01:01.559> achieve<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
diode clipping to help achieve the

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.390 
diode clipping to help achieve the
distortion<00:01:02.760> sound<00:01:03.059> which<00:01:03.989> now<00:01:04.350> most<00:01:05.010> stamps

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
distortion sound which now most stamps

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.760 
distortion sound which now most stamps
are<00:01:05.549> based<00:01:05.729> around<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.360> but<00:01:07.049> as<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.409> say<00:01:07.619> at

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
are based around that but as I say at

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.050 
are based around that but as I say at
the<00:01:07.890> time<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.280> think<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.549> was<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.850> first

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
the time I think this was the first

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.780 
the time I think this was the first
amplitur<00:01:09.510> used<00:01:09.900> diode<00:01:10.320> clipping<00:01:10.830> it's<00:01:11.490> great

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
amplitur used diode clipping it's great

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.000 
amplitur used diode clipping it's great
for<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.150> classic<00:01:12.420> rock<00:01:12.810> sound<00:01:13.200> great<00:01:13.590> for<00:01:13.830> heavy

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
for a classic rock sound great for heavy

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.120 
for a classic rock sound great for heavy
music<00:01:14.310> very<00:01:14.909> smooth<00:01:15.479> very<00:01:15.750> saturated<00:01:16.259> dr

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
music very smooth very saturated dr

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.820 
music very smooth very saturated dr
channel<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:18.630> clean<00:01:18.869> channel<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.350> not<00:01:19.500> great

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
channel the clean channel is not great

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.600 
channel the clean channel is not great
but<00:01:20.189> that's<00:01:20.520> fairly<00:01:21.270> typical<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.900> marshalls

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
but that's fairly typical of marshalls

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.749 
but that's fairly typical of marshalls
so<00:01:23.610> i<00:01:23.670> move<00:01:23.880> up<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:25.080> amp<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:26.159> marshal

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
so i move up this amp is the marshal

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.550 
so i move up this amp is the marshal

were made in limited numbers and I was

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.380 
were made in limited numbers and I was
lucky<00:01:41.310> enough<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:42.000> get<00:01:42.420> one<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:43.640> then<00:01:44.640> sold<00:01:45.119> it

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
lucky enough to get one I then sold it

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.719 
lucky enough to get one I then sold it
it<00:01:45.540> was<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:45.930> lamp<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.680> I'm<00:01:46.799> lucky<00:01:47.189> enough<00:01:47.369> to

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
it was this lamp and I'm lucky enough to

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.990 
it was this lamp and I'm lucky enough to
have<00:01:47.820> ended<00:01:48.149> up<00:01:48.360> with<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:49.229> again<00:01:49.850> required<00:01:50.850> it

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
have ended up with it again required it

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.100 
have ended up with it again required it
again<00:01:51.180> about<00:01:51.390> 3-4<00:01:52.170> months<00:01:52.380> ago<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.720> now<00:01:54.720> this

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
again about 3-4 months ago and now this

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.039 
again about 3-4 months ago and now this
amp<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.710> an<00:01:56.219> absolute<00:01:56.790> monster<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.600> think<00:01:57.930> as

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
amp is an absolute monster I think as

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.319 
amp is an absolute monster I think as
far<00:01:58.079> as<00:01:58.500> sort<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:58.799> versatility<00:01:59.430> goes<00:01:59.939> and

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
far as sort of versatility goes and

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.840 
far as sort of versatility goes and
power<00:02:00.570> it's<00:02:01.380> probably<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.950> best<00:02:01.979> at<00:02:02.399> Marshall

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
power it's probably the best at Marshall

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.480 
power it's probably the best at Marshall
ever<00:02:03.030> made<00:02:03.329> you've<00:02:04.290> got<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.560> very<00:02:04.979> very<00:02:05.250> good

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
ever made you've got a very very good

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.520 
ever made you've got a very very good
clean<00:02:05.820> channel<00:02:06.270> which<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.659> surprising<00:02:07.320> for<00:02:07.469> a

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
clean channel which is surprising for a

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.070 
clean channel which is surprising for a
marshal<00:02:08.129> you've<00:02:08.729> got<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:08.970> crunch<00:02:09.330> channel<00:02:09.899> and

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
marshal you've got a crunch channel and

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.450 
marshal you've got a crunch channel and
then<00:02:10.590> you've<00:02:10.770> got<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.039> lead<00:02:11.310> channel

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
then you've got a lead channel

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.490 
then you've got a lead channel
which<00:02:12.790> is<00:02:13.000> what<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.330> L<00:02:13.480> M<00:02:13.660> stands<00:02:14.080> for<00:02:14.230> lead

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
which is what the L M stands for lead

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.730 
which is what the L M stands for lead
modification<00:02:15.490> and<00:02:15.960> the<00:02:16.960> lead<00:02:17.140> channels<00:02:17.560> also

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
modification and the lead channels also

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.240 
modification and the lead channels also
got<00:02:18.100> a<00:02:18.130> gang<00:02:18.400> boost<00:02:18.790> if<00:02:19.090> you<00:02:19.270> need<00:02:19.480> it<00:02:19.720> and<00:02:20.250> very

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
got a gang boost if you need it and very

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.030 
got a gang boost if you need it and very
very<00:02:21.460> versatile<00:02:22.240> independent<00:02:23.170> eq's<00:02:23.680> on<00:02:23.890> each

very versatile independent eq's on each

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.910 
very versatile independent eq's on each
channel<00:02:24.610> it's<00:02:25.240> a<00:02:25.480> hundred<00:02:25.840> what<00:02:26.080> head<00:02:26.380> but

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
channel it's a hundred what head but

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.070 
channel it's a hundred what head but
it's<00:02:27.070> got<00:02:27.280> several<00:02:27.700> switchable<00:02:28.270> modes<00:02:28.660> you

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
it's got several switchable modes you

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.220 
it's got several switchable modes you
can<00:02:29.110> use<00:02:29.380> it<00:02:29.410> in<00:02:29.650> triode<00:02:30.190> pentode<00:02:30.910> half<00:02:31.840> power

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
can use it in triode pentode half power

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.990 
can use it in triode pentode half power
which<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.860> lot<00:02:32.980> of<00:02:33.010> people<00:02:33.100> like<00:02:33.490> to<00:02:33.550> do<00:02:33.790> when

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
which a lot of people like to do when

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.970 
which a lot of people like to do when
recording<00:02:34.330> you<00:02:34.840> can<00:02:35.020> crank<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.410> amp<00:02:35.560> further

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
recording you can crank the amp further

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.610 
recording you can crank the amp further
so<00:02:36.910> you<00:02:37.000> kind<00:02:37.390> of<00:02:37.450> drought<00:02:37.690> drive<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.320> valves

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
so you kind of drought drive the valves

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.150 
so you kind of drought drive the valves
a<00:02:38.710> bit<00:02:38.890> harder<00:02:39.660> it's<00:02:40.660> got<00:02:40.870> a<00:02:40.900> real<00:02:41.200> raw<00:02:41.590> to<00:02:41.980> it

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
a bit harder it's got a real raw to it

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.060 
a bit harder it's got a real raw to it
this<00:02:42.310> amp<00:02:42.580> bit<00:02:43.480> more<00:02:43.690> modern<00:02:43.870> sounding<00:02:44.740> than

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
this amp bit more modern sounding than

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.720 
this amp bit more modern sounding than
the<00:02:45.220> jcm<00:02:45.730> 800<00:02:46.980> it's<00:02:47.980> a<00:02:48.070> completely<00:02:48.460> different

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
the jcm 800 it's a completely different

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.140 
the jcm 800 it's a completely different
sounding<00:02:49.270> amp<00:02:49.420> really<00:02:49.900> so<00:02:50.650> got<00:02:51.370> a<00:02:51.400> bit<00:02:51.880> of<00:02:52.000> a

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
sounding amp really so got a bit of a

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.440 
sounding amp really so got a bit of a
sort<00:02:52.420> of<00:02:52.800> span<00:02:53.800> of<00:02:53.830> the<00:02:54.490> Marshall<00:02:55.060> history

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
sort of span of the Marshall history

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.480 
sort of span of the Marshall history
there<00:02:55.890> 1987<00:02:57.630> 1997<00:02:58.630> on<00:02:59.590> top<00:02:59.800> of<00:02:59.830> that<00:03:00.100> we've<00:03:00.310> got

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
there 1987 1997 on top of that we've got

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.600 
there 1987 1997 on top of that we've got
a<00:03:00.520> Selma<00:03:01.090> treble<00:03:01.510> and<00:03:01.630> bass<00:03:01.780> 50<00:03:02.470> this<00:03:03.340> scents

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
a Selma treble and bass 50 this scents

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.640 
a Selma treble and bass 50 this scents
from<00:03:03.930> 1972<00:03:04.930> it's<00:03:05.440> also<00:03:05.590> a<00:03:05.830> 50<00:03:06.430> watt<00:03:06.550> valve<00:03:06.880> amp

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
from 1972 it's also a 50 watt valve amp

sound<00:03:28.750> great<00:03:28.900> if<00:03:29.170> you<00:03:29.320> patch<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:29.800> channels

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
sound great if you patch the channels

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.770 
together really sort of drives the amp
and<00:03:32.530> you<00:03:33.100> get<00:03:33.250> a<00:03:33.280> nice<00:03:33.490> sort<00:03:34.120> of<00:03:34.180> saturated
