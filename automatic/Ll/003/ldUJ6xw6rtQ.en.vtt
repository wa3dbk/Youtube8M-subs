it up I don't think there's any updated
trailers<00:01:51.960> or<00:01:52.170> anything<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:52.920> there's<00:01:53.280> there's

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
not too much for us to really get a

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.060 
not too much for us to really get a
grasp<00:01:57.270> on<00:01:57.630> what<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:58.049> expect<00:01:58.649> but

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
grasp on what to expect but

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.109
