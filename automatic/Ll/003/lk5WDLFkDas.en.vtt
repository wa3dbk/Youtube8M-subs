control<00:01:23.580> let's<00:01:23.909> say<00:01:24.180> Siri<00:01:25.049> with<00:01:25.380> my<00:01:25.560> left<00:01:25.799> head

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
control let's say Siri with my left head

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.160 
control let's say Siri with my left head
movement<00:01:26.040> go<00:01:26.850> ahead<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.090> turn<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.330> back<00:01:27.360> on<00:01:27.689> if

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
movement go ahead and turn it back on if

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.890 
movement go ahead and turn it back on if
I<00:01:28.890> turn<00:01:29.130> my<00:01:29.310> head<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.670> left<00:01:29.759> here<00:01:30.240> as<00:01:30.420> you

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
I turn my head to the left here as you

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.670 
I turn my head to the left here as you
can<00:01:30.990> see<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.229> jumps<00:01:31.560> right<00:01:31.890> into<00:01:32.130> Siri<00:01:33.680> without

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
can see it jumps right into Siri without

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.380 
can see it jumps right into Siri without
even<00:01:34.979> touching<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.790> screen<00:01:36.030> or<00:01:36.210> anything

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
even touching the screen or anything

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.240 
even touching the screen or anything
which<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.689> pretty<00:01:36.960> awesome<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.590> essentially

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
which is pretty awesome and essentially

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.249 
which is pretty awesome and essentially
you<00:01:38.430> can<00:01:38.520> do<00:01:38.640> this<00:01:38.759> with<00:01:38.909> any<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.270> these<00:01:39.420> actual

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
you can do this with any of these actual

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.260 
you can do this with any of these actual
movements<00:01:40.770> I'll<00:01:40.890> go<00:01:41.040> ahead<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.340> delete<00:01:42.030> this

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
movements I'll go ahead and delete this

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.170 
movements I'll go ahead and delete this
add<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.990> new<00:01:43.439> one<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:44.280> let's<00:01:44.430> say<00:01:44.640> for<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:45.000> home

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
add a new one so let's say for the home

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.730 
add a new one so let's say for the home
button<00:01:45.540> with<00:01:46.170> my<00:01:46.290> left<00:01:46.560> head<00:01:46.710> movement

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
button with my left head movement

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.700 
button with my left head movement
movement<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:48.000> turn<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.390> on<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.840> then<00:01:49.350> turn<00:01:49.530> my

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
movement I turn this on and then turn my

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.130 
movement I turn this on and then turn my
head<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.979> left<00:01:50.540> it<00:01:51.540> will<00:01:51.750> actually<00:01:51.899> go

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
head to the left it will actually go

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.960 
head to the left it will actually go
directly<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.770> home<00:01:52.920> screen<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.790> as<00:01:53.820> you

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
directly to the home screen so as you

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.670 
directly to the home screen so as you
can<00:01:54.060> see<00:01:54.240> that's<00:01:54.390> how<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.689> works<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.380> really

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
can see that's how it works it is really

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.990 
can see that's how it works it is really
cool<00:01:55.890> actually<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:56.369> my<00:01:56.490> opinion<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:56.969> I

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
cool actually in my opinion and I

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.889 
cool actually in my opinion and I
figured<00:01:57.299> I'd<00:01:57.360> share<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.659> with<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.869> guys

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
figured I'd share it with you guys

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.240 
figured I'd share it with you guys
because<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.409> hidden<00:01:58.649> feature<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.130> many

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
because it is a hidden feature that many

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.039 
because it is a hidden feature that many
people<00:01:59.490> didn't<00:01:59.909> notice<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.810> was<00:02:00.899> posted

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
people didn't notice and it was posted

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.260 
people didn't notice and it was posted
online<00:02:01.350> earlier<00:02:01.920> this<00:02:02.070> week<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:02.909> think<00:02:03.180> it

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
online earlier this week and I think it

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.420 
online earlier this week and I think it
actually<00:02:03.390> is<00:02:03.600> really<00:02:03.869> cool<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:04.439> basically

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
actually is really cool so basically

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.950 
actually is really cool so basically
what<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:05.790> have<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:06.000> do<00:02:06.090> is<00:02:06.240> go<00:02:06.329> into<00:02:06.540> settings

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
what you have to do is go into settings

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.710 
what you have to do is go into settings
then<00:02:07.320> general<00:02:07.369> then<00:02:08.369> accessibility<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:09.300> then

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
then general then accessibility and then

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.330 
then general then accessibility and then
scroll<00:02:09.989> down<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.440> switch<00:02:10.709> control<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.220> that's

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
scroll down to switch control and that's

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.290 
scroll down to switch control and that's
how<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.489> can<00:02:11.670> control<00:02:12.000> it

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
how you can control it

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.790 
how you can control it
you<00:02:12.540> can<00:02:12.690> also<00:02:12.810> set<00:02:13.200> different<00:02:13.230> talk

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
you can also set different talk

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.640 
you can also set different talk
to<00:02:14.130> set<00:02:15.090> up<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.270> speed<00:02:15.570> of<00:02:15.780> how<00:02:15.930> fast<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.410> blue

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
to set up the speed of how fast the blue

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.500 
to set up the speed of how fast the blue
box<00:02:16.920> scrolls<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.520> all<00:02:17.610> that<00:02:17.820> good<00:02:18.000> stuff<00:02:18.030> and

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
box scrolls and all that good stuff and

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.150 
box scrolls and all that good stuff and
overall<00:02:19.350> I<00:02:19.410> think<00:02:19.560> this<00:02:19.650> is<00:02:19.740> a<00:02:19.770> pretty<00:02:19.950> cool

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
overall I think this is a pretty cool

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.100 
overall I think this is a pretty cool
hidden<00:02:20.490> feature<00:02:20.670> I'm<00:02:21.330> not<00:02:21.540> sure<00:02:21.750> how<00:02:21.960> much

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
hidden feature I'm not sure how much

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.210 
hidden feature I'm not sure how much
this<00:02:22.230> will<00:02:22.380> be<00:02:22.500> used<00:02:22.740> in<00:02:22.890> terms<00:02:23.100> of

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
this will be used in terms of

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.620 
this will be used in terms of
accessibility<00:02:23.700> because<00:02:24.090> most<00:02:24.300> people<00:02:24.540> will

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
accessibility because most people will

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.600 
accessibility because most people will
probably<00:02:24.810> just<00:02:25.080> prefer<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.650> touch<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.280> screen

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
probably just prefer to touch the screen

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.310 
probably just prefer to touch the screen
or<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:27.390> home<00:02:27.540> button<00:02:27.810> or<00:02:27.930> something<00:02:28.230> like

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
or the home button or something like

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.170 
or the home button or something like
that<00:02:28.380> to<00:02:28.710> access<00:02:29.010> their<00:02:29.160> apps<00:02:29.340> or<00:02:29.550> use<00:02:30.060> the

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
that to access their apps or use the

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.060 
that to access their apps or use the
multi<00:02:30.420> touching<00:02:30.750> but<00:02:31.350> it<00:02:31.500> is<00:02:31.620> nice<00:02:31.830> to<00:02:31.950> see

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
multi touching but it is nice to see

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.380 
multi touching but it is nice to see
Apple<00:02:32.400> is<00:02:32.460> adding<00:02:32.700> new<00:02:32.730> accessibility

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
Apple is adding new accessibility

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.690 
Apple is adding new accessibility
features<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.110> this<00:02:34.800> probably<00:02:35.220> means<00:02:35.430> that<00:02:35.670> a

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
features and this probably means that a

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.160 
features and this probably means that a
near<00:02:36.000> future<00:02:36.150> that<00:02:36.450> we'll<00:02:36.540> be<00:02:36.630> making<00:02:36.750> closer

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
near future that we'll be making closer

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.710 
near future that we'll be making closer
to<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.440> Xbox<00:02:37.710> or<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.130> Wii<00:02:38.450> where<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.570> can

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
to the Xbox or the Wii where you can

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.090 
to the Xbox or the Wii where you can
actually<00:02:39.870> use<00:02:40.140> different<00:02:40.470> motion<00:02:40.800> controls

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
actually use different motion controls

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.890 
actually use different motion controls
using<00:02:41.460> using<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.060> camera<00:02:42.540> your<00:02:42.720> head

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
using using the camera your head

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.450 
using using the camera your head
movements<00:02:43.440> turning<00:02:43.740> your<00:02:43.830> head<00:02:43.950> side<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.190> side

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
movements turning your head side to side

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.210 
movements turning your head side to side
or<00:02:44.670> finger<00:02:45.480> motions<00:02:45.900> or<00:02:46.140> actual<00:02:47.040> new

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
or finger motions or actual new

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.410 
or finger motions or actual new
gyroscopes<00:02:47.820> where<00:02:47.970> you<00:02:48.030> can<00:02:48.150> move<00:02:48.300> your

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
gyroscopes where you can move your

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.030 
gyroscopes where you can move your
device<00:02:48.540> like<00:02:48.930> so<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.470> you<00:02:49.800> can<00:02:49.920> actually

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
device like so and you can actually

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.670 
device like so and you can actually
access<00:02:50.400> new<00:02:50.880> motion<00:02:51.300> features<00:02:51.660> so<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.290> is<00:02:52.440> very
