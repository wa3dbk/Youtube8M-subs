perfecting<00:02:33.980> this<00:02:34.250> look<00:02:34.489> and<00:02:34.670> feel<00:02:34.910> but<00:02:35.750> let's

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
perfecting this look and feel but let's

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.770 
perfecting this look and feel but let's
not<00:02:36.500> forget<00:02:36.860> what's<00:02:37.220> under<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:37.550> hood

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
not forget what's under the hood

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.360 
not forget what's under the hood
starting<00:02:38.780> with<00:02:38.870> connectivity<00:02:39.319> and<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:40.130> fact

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
starting with connectivity and the fact

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.670 
starting with connectivity and the fact
that<00:02:40.580> this<00:02:40.790> is<00:02:40.849> set<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.269> go<00:02:41.390> out<00:02:41.569> as<00:02:41.750> a<00:02:41.780> 4G<00:02:42.410> LTE

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680
