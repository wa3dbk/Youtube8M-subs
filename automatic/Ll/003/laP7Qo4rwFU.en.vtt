00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
now in the ends that are hanging over

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:38.490 
now in the ends that are hanging over
just<00:04:37.180> kind<00:04:37.389> of<00:04:37.479> tuck<00:04:37.720> them<00:04:37.900> over<00:04:38.139> just<00:04:38.169> like

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
just kind of tuck them over just like

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.950 
just kind of tuck them over just like
this<00:04:38.910> you<00:04:39.910> go<00:04:40.060> ahead<00:04:40.270> and<00:04:40.419> push<00:04:40.570> them<00:04:40.750> in<00:04:40.840> with
