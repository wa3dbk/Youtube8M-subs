top<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.740> work<00:00:10.920> with<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.130> bottom<00:00:11.460> as<00:00:11.670> you<00:00:11.730> can

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
top and work with the bottom as you can

top and work with the bottom as you can
see<00:00:12.120> I<00:00:12.150> welded<00:00:12.480> them<00:00:12.719> together<00:00:13.190> you<00:00:14.190> need<00:00:14.340> a

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
see I welded them together you need a

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.550 
see I welded them together you need a
lot<00:00:14.549> of<00:00:14.670> spare<00:00:14.820> bike<00:00:15.000> parts<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.630> some<00:00:16.320> extra

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
lot of spare bike parts and some extra

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.599 
lot of spare bike parts and some extra
length<00:00:16.710> of<00:00:16.920> chain<00:00:18.980> the<00:00:19.980> first<00:00:20.010> thing<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:20.460> want

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
length of chain the first thing you want

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.310 
length of chain the first thing you want
to<00:00:20.640> do<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:20.910> take<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.119> seat<00:00:21.480> off<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.689> lower<00:00:22.020> bike

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
to do is take a seat off the lower bike

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.640 
to do is take a seat off the lower bike
and<00:00:22.590> weld<00:00:22.859> some<00:00:23.039> brackets<00:00:23.460> up<00:00:24.109> to<00:00:25.109> extend<00:00:25.500> to

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
and weld some brackets up to extend to

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.470 
and weld some brackets up to extend to
the<00:00:25.830> upper<00:00:26.730> bike<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.210> use<00:00:27.539> 3/4<00:00:28.170> inch<00:00:28.320> angle<00:00:28.500> iron

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
the upper bike I use 3/4 inch angle iron

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.759 
the upper bike I use 3/4 inch angle iron
and<00:00:30.480> then<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.750> second<00:00:31.109> thing<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.349> need<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.619> do

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
and then the second thing you need to do

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.290 
and then the second thing you need to do
is<00:00:32.040> connect<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.969> steering<00:00:33.390> for<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.320> front<00:00:35.300> of

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
is connect the steering for the front of

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.729 
is connect the steering for the front of
the<00:00:37.230> bikes<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:38.120> just<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.780> notice<00:00:40.110> how<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.410> put

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
the bikes and just you notice how I put

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.040 
the bikes and just you notice how I put
these<00:00:40.980> here<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.940> seemed<00:00:42.270> like<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.450> good<00:00:42.660> idea<00:00:42.719> at

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
these here it seemed like a good idea at

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.479 
these here it seemed like a good idea at
the<00:00:43.110> time<00:00:43.140> but<00:00:43.620> because<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:45.770> top<00:00:46.770> fork<00:00:47.219> is

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
the time but because the top fork is

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.110 
the time but because the top fork is
off-center<00:00:48.320> with<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.469> bottom<00:00:50.010> pivot<00:00:50.340> its

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
off-center with the bottom pivot its

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.540 
off-center with the bottom pivot its
turns<00:00:51.780> kind<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.199> hard<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:52.770> we've<00:00:53.070> been<00:00:53.520> a

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
turns kind of hard so we've been a

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.270 
turns kind of hard so we've been a
better<00:00:53.789> idea<00:00:53.879> if<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.390> put<00:00:54.600> them<00:00:54.750> down<00:00:55.020> here<00:00:55.980> for

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
better idea if I put them down here for

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.700 
better idea if I put them down here for
example<00:00:58.160> if<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.280> use<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.640> pipe<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.500> attach<00:01:01.500> it

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
example if I use the pipe and attach it

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.450 
example if I use the pipe and attach it
directly<00:01:01.859> from<00:01:02.129> here<00:01:03.049> down<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.080> here<00:01:04.250> it<00:01:05.250> would

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
directly from here down to here it would

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.550 
directly from here down to here it would
turn<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.700> lot<00:01:05.970> easier<00:01:08.360> now<00:01:09.360> once<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.229> get<00:01:10.380> those

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
turn a lot easier now once you get those

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.990 
turn a lot easier now once you get those
connected<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.430> can<00:01:11.490> kind<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.820> make<00:01:11.970> sure

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
connected you can kind of make sure

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.580 
connected you can kind of make sure
everything<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.479> working<00:01:12.659> make<00:01:13.290> sure<00:01:13.320> it's

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
everything is working make sure it's

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.440 
everything is working make sure it's
strong<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:15.920> when<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.130> weld<00:01:18.060> those<00:01:18.240> together

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
strong and when you weld those together

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.710 
strong and when you weld those together
make<00:01:19.439> sure<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.770> sprockets<00:01:20.250> are<00:01:20.369> lined<00:01:20.610> up<00:01:20.790> how

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
make sure the sprockets are lined up how

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.190 
make sure the sprockets are lined up how
I<00:01:21.750> did<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:22.290> was<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.280> ran<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.580> chain<00:01:24.080> from<00:01:25.080> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
I did this was I ran a chain from the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.730 
I did this was I ran a chain from the
top<00:01:25.500> outer<00:01:25.799> sprocket<00:01:27.049> to<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.170> bottom<00:01:28.560> outer

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
top outer sprocket to the bottom outer

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.460 
top outer sprocket to the bottom outer
sprocket<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.430> then<00:01:30.150> there's<00:01:30.360> a

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
sprocket and then there's a

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.690 
sprocket and then there's a
spring-loaded<00:01:31.470> idler<00:01:31.829> in<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.280> middle<00:01:32.549> to

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
spring-loaded idler in the middle to

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.719 
spring-loaded idler in the middle to
keep<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.299> chain<00:01:33.659> in<00:01:33.990> place<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.560> left<00:01:35.460> the

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
keep the chain in place I left the

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.179 
keep the chain in place I left the
pedals<00:01:36.509> on<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.750> bottom<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.710> chain<00:01:37.950> on

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
pedals on the bottom and the chain on

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.789 
pedals on the bottom and the chain on
the<00:01:38.310> bottom<00:01:38.810> so<00:01:39.810> as<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:40.229> can<00:01:40.380> see<00:01:40.530> when<00:01:40.710> you

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
the bottom so as you can see when you

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.429 
the bottom so as you can see when you
move<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.070> top<00:01:41.280> ones<00:01:41.689> the<00:01:42.689> bottom<00:01:43.020> ones<00:01:43.200> move

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
move the top ones the bottom ones move

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.889 
move the top ones the bottom ones move
too<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:44.329> this<00:01:45.329> moves<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:48.180> idler<00:01:48.540> kind<00:01:48.810> of

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
too and this moves you the idler kind of

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.370 
too and this moves you the idler kind of
keeps<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.290> whole<00:01:49.439> thing<00:01:49.470> in<00:01:49.829> place

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.020 

so<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.430> just<00:01:53.610> need<00:01:53.760> to<00:01:53.880> make<00:01:54.000> spring-loaded

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
so you just need to make spring-loaded

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.539 
so you just need to make spring-loaded
idler<00:01:57.200> that's<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.380> back<00:01:58.799> sprocket<00:01:59.220> off<00:01:59.520> a

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
idler that's the back sprocket off a

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.090 
idler that's the back sprocket off a
derailleur<00:02:00.229> it's<00:02:01.229> already<00:02:01.470> got<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.740> bearings

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
derailleur it's already got the bearings

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.719 
derailleur it's already got the bearings
in<00:02:02.220> it<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.490> everything<00:02:02.850> look<00:02:03.150> pretty<00:02:03.330> well

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
in it and everything look pretty well

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.809 
in it and everything look pretty well
and<00:02:05.729> then<00:02:05.880> hook<00:02:06.119> up<00:02:06.210> your<00:02:06.360> front<00:02:06.509> brakes<00:02:07.819> with

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
and then hook up your front brakes with

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.729 
and then hook up your front brakes with
a<00:02:08.850> big<00:02:09.060> Mullen<00:02:09.330> cable<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.319> can<00:02:10.440> even<00:02:10.590> have

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
a big Mullen cable and you can even have

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.530 
a big Mullen cable and you can even have
shift<00:02:11.069> in<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.280> rear<00:02:11.459> which<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:11.880> what<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.030> did

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
shift in the rear which is what I did

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.330 
shift in the rear which is what I did
works<00:02:13.260> pretty<00:02:13.410> good<00:02:13.530> you<00:02:13.830> can<00:02:13.860> get<00:02:14.100> going

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
works pretty good you can get going

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.030 
works pretty good you can get going
pretty<00:02:14.459> good<00:02:14.730> on<00:02:14.850> it<00:02:14.880> with<00:02:15.150> six<00:02:15.360> speeds<00:02:15.630> and

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
pretty good on it with six speeds and

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.680 
pretty good on it with six speeds and
then<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.130> put<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.370> bar<00:02:17.610> in<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.850> middle<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.540> make

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
then I put a bar in the middle to make

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.380 
then I put a bar in the middle to make
it<00:02:18.930> easier<00:02:19.860> for<00:02:20.069> me<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.250> step<00:02:20.430> up<00:02:20.610> on<00:02:20.819> to<00:02:21.090> and

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
it easier for me to step up on to and

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.720 
it easier for me to step up on to and
get<00:02:21.780> on<00:02:21.930> it

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
get on it

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.210 
get on it
it's<00:02:23.730> pretty<00:02:24.200> pretty<00:02:25.200> much<00:02:25.440> it<00:02:25.650> it's<00:02:26.010> pretty

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
it's pretty pretty much it it's pretty

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.300 
it's pretty pretty much it it's pretty
simple<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.940> longer<00:02:27.150> you<00:02:27.209> have<00:02:27.360> some<00:02:27.540> good

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
simple the longer you have some good

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.270 
simple the longer you have some good
welding<00:02:29.310> skills<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:30.000> some<00:02:30.239> basic<00:02:31.280> tool

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
welding skills and some basic tool

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.120 
welding skills and some basic tool
skills<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:33.569> can<00:02:33.750> build<00:02:33.930> one<00:02:34.140> this<00:02:34.709> took<00:02:34.980> me

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
skills you can build one this took me

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.309 
skills you can build one this took me
about<00:02:35.510> four<00:02:36.510> or<00:02:36.600> five<00:02:36.720> hours<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:37.440> do<00:02:39.230> yeah<00:02:40.230> I

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
about four or five hours to do yeah I

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.010 
about four or five hours to do yeah I
guess<00:02:40.530> that's<00:02:40.739> about<00:02:40.860> it
