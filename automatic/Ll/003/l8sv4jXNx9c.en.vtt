to<00:00:25.830> test<00:00:26.039> this<00:00:26.220> rubber<00:00:26.430> was<00:00:26.640> Tom<00:00:26.849> Cruise<00:00:27.199> which

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
to test this rubber was Tom Cruise which

to test this rubber was Tom Cruise which
is<00:00:28.320> very<00:00:28.500> unusual<00:00:28.650> in<00:00:29.010> any<00:00:29.369> kind<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.670> rock

it's<00:00:38.219> in<00:00:38.340> Dubai<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.420> was<00:00:39.510> they<00:00:39.899> called<00:00:40.079> us

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
it's in Dubai and it was they called us

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.990 
it's in Dubai and it was they called us
up<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.590> they<00:00:40.649> said<00:00:40.950> can<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.520> make<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.730> rubber

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
up and they said can you make a rubber

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.760 
up and they said can you make a rubber
that<00:00:42.120> will<00:00:42.210> stick<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.570> glass<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.140> when<00:00:43.260> 12<00:00:43.500> G's

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
that will stick to glass and when 12 G's

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.340 
that will stick to glass and when 12 G's
we<00:00:43.920> don't<00:00:44.070> get<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.190> lot<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.460> call<00:00:45.180> from<00:00:45.420> people

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
we don't get a lot of call from people

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.619 
we don't get a lot of call from people
climbing<00:00:46.649> on<00:00:46.739> glass<00:00:46.980> but<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.340> said<00:00:47.460> okay<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.059> we

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
climbing on glass but it said okay so we

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.720 
climbing on glass but it said okay so we
tried<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:49.020> we<00:00:49.140> made<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.710> worked<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.190> then<00:00:50.700> I

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
tried it we made it it worked and then I

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.069 
tried it we made it it worked and then I
made<00:00:50.969> because<00:00:51.239> it's<00:00:51.390> Tom<00:00:51.539> Cruise<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.899> made<00:00:52.050> a

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
made because it's Tom Cruise I made a

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.200 
made because it's Tom Cruise I made a
pair<00:00:52.289> for<00:00:52.440> myself<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.610> started<00:00:53.730> bouldering

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
pair for myself and I started bouldering

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.910 
pair for myself and I started bouldering
around<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:54.690> went<00:00:54.840> wow<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.469> actually

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
around it I went wow this is actually

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.630 
around it I went wow this is actually
something<00:00:56.610> unique<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.500> so<00:00:58.500> no<00:00:59.280> one<00:00:59.399> had<00:00:59.520> ever

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
something unique and so no one had ever

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.000 
something unique and so no one had ever
made<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.120> rubber<00:01:00.449> soft<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:01.739> way<00:01:01.949> before

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
made a rubber soft in this way before

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.840 
made a rubber soft in this way before
because<00:01:04.070> generally<00:01:05.070> speaking<00:01:05.400> if<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.670> rubber

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
because generally speaking if the rubber

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.570 
because generally speaking if the rubber
gets<00:01:06.180> very<00:01:06.330> soft<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.810> wears<00:01:06.990> out<00:01:07.140> super<00:01:07.530> fast

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
gets very soft it wears out super fast

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.520 
gets very soft it wears out super fast
but<00:01:08.580> in<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:08.820> case<00:01:09.060> we<00:01:09.689> were<00:01:09.810> able<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.140> use

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
but in this case we were able to use

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.870 
but in this case we were able to use
some<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.799> our<00:01:10.979> other<00:01:11.220> technology

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
some of our other technology

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.460 
some of our other technology
particularly<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.630> rubber<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.049> we'd<00:01:13.290> made

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
particularly the rubber that we'd made

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.520 
particularly the rubber that we'd made
called<00:01:13.710> onyx<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.310> make<00:01:15.299> which<00:01:15.840> just<00:01:16.290> last

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
called onyx and make which just last

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.760 
called onyx and make which just last
forever<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.220> we're<00:01:17.790> able<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.240> make<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:18.770> very

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
forever and we're able to make this very

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.649 
forever and we're able to make this very
very<00:01:19.920> soft<00:01:20.490> rubber<00:01:20.729> in<00:01:20.850> fact<00:01:21.030> if<00:01:21.210> we're<00:01:21.540> all

three styles of climbing shoes nowadays
but<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.240> problem<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.689> make<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.840> soft<00:02:01.110> shoe

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
but the problem is you make a soft shoe

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.010 
but the problem is you make a soft shoe
but<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.040> had<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.219> hard<00:02:02.520> rubber<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.600> we've

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
but it had a hard rubber so we've

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.719 
but it had a hard rubber so we've
actually<00:02:04.229> made<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.680> whole<00:02:04.829> thing<00:02:05.070> finally<00:02:05.549> we

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
actually made the whole thing finally we

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.609 
actually made the whole thing finally we
finally<00:02:06.210> made<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.509> proper<00:02:06.750> type<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.409> shoe

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
finally made the proper type of shoe

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.889 
finally made the proper type of shoe
where<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.160> make<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.340> soft<00:02:08.670> shoe<00:02:08.970> with<00:02:09.569> soft

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
where you make a soft shoe with soft

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.420 
where you make a soft shoe with soft
rubber<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.289> has<00:02:10.470> all<00:02:10.679> these<00:02:10.800> advantages<00:02:11.310> we

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
rubber it has all these advantages we

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.729 
rubber it has all these advantages we
didn't<00:02:11.640> even<00:02:11.760> realize

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
didn't even realize

didn't even realize
but<00:02:13.739> you<00:02:13.860> can<00:02:14.040> feel<00:02:14.400> everything<00:02:14.909> but<00:02:15.510> you

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
but you can feel everything but you

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.690 
but you can feel everything but you
