hey guys mr. Ajay stuck here today we
got<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:10.950> quick<00:00:11.309> tweak<00:00:11.610> review<00:00:12.059> from<00:00:12.719> Taniya<00:00:13.110> now

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
got a quick tweak review from Taniya now

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.410 
got a quick tweak review from Taniya now
this<00:00:13.889> tweak<00:00:14.219> is<00:00:14.370> called<00:00:14.639> grab<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:14.969> board<00:00:15.210> and

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
this tweak is called grab a board and

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.620 
this tweak is called grab a board and
it's<00:00:16.350> not<00:00:16.529> exactly<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:17.070> tweak<00:00:17.520> like<00:00:17.970> something

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
it's not exactly a tweak like something

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.950 
it's not exactly a tweak like something
that<00:00:18.660> you<00:00:18.930> would<00:00:19.050> use<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.439> help<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.490> or<00:00:20.960> it's

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
that you would use to help you or it's

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.140 
that you would use to help you or it's
not<00:00:22.080> really<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.410> modification<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:23.279> way<00:00:23.490> it's

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
not really a modification that way it's

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.630 
not really a modification that way it's
more<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.449> modification<00:00:24.840> just<00:00:25.410> for<00:00:25.560> fun<00:00:25.740> so

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640

more of a modification just for fun so
I'm<00:00:27.599> going<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.810> quickly<00:00:27.990> demonstrate<00:00:28.320> this

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
I'm going to quickly demonstrate this

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.359 
I'm going to quickly demonstrate this
but<00:00:29.460> um<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:30.449> have<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.599> few<00:00:30.840> options<00:00:30.949> I'm<00:00:31.949> just

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
but um you have a few options I'm just

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.910 
but um you have a few options I'm just
going<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.669> demonstrate<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.480> earth<00:00:33.750> one<00:00:34.079> so

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
going to demonstrate the earth one so

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.030 
going to demonstrate the earth one so
this<00:00:35.130> uses<00:00:35.520> activator<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.649> this<00:00:37.649> works<00:00:37.890> on

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
this uses activator and this works on

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.420 
this uses activator and this works on
iphone<00:00:38.489> ipad<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.210> ipods<00:00:39.800> so<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:41.100> have<00:00:41.250> my

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
iphone ipad and ipods so I have my

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.500 
iphone ipad and ipods so I have my
activators<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.149> just<00:00:42.480> pulled<00:00:42.989> down<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:44.120> now<00:00:45.120> it

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
activators I just pulled down and now it

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.580 
activators I just pulled down and now it
allows<00:00:45.809> me<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.320> freely<00:00:47.250> move<00:00:47.550> my<00:00:48.149> icons<00:00:48.660> either

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
allows me to freely move my icons either

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.900 
allows me to freely move my icons either
by<00:00:50.070> my<00:00:51.680> orientation<00:00:53.690> like<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.930> or<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:56.399> can

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
by my orientation like that or I can

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.520 
by my orientation like that or I can
drag<00:00:56.940> them<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:58.379> let's<00:00:58.710> say<00:00:58.949> we<00:00:59.219> want<00:00:59.399> to<00:01:00.530> you

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
drag them so let's say we want to you

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.399 
drag them so let's say we want to you
can<00:01:01.649> just<00:01:01.680> like<00:01:02.129> drag<00:01:02.850> them<00:01:03.030> all<00:01:03.210> around<00:01:03.510> now

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
can just like drag them all around now

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.469 
can just like drag them all around now
this<00:01:04.589> was<00:01:04.830> just<00:01:05.220> released<00:01:05.549> in<00:01:05.729> cydia<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.330> this

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
this was just released in cydia and this

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.929 
this was just released in cydia and this
is<00:01:06.659> definitely<00:01:06.900> going<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.290> be<00:01:07.380> some<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:08.130> pretty

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
is definitely going to be some a pretty

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.719 
is definitely going to be some a pretty
cool<00:01:09.180> tweak<00:01:09.979> definitely<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.040> lot<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.310> hard<00:01:11.640> work

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
cool tweak definitely a lot of hard work

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.580 
cool tweak definitely a lot of hard work
was<00:01:12.210> put<00:01:12.479> into<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:14.479> so<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.750> does<00:01:16.049> rely<00:01:16.409> on

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
was put into this so this does rely on

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.200 
was put into this so this does rely on
mobile<00:01:16.979> substrate<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.640> let's<00:01:17.850> just<00:01:17.909> show<00:01:18.150> you

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
mobile substrate and let's just show you

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.480 
mobile substrate and let's just show you
a<00:01:18.330> few<00:01:18.540> other<00:01:18.750> settings<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.650> can<00:01:19.680> still<00:01:20.250> click

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
a few other settings you can still click

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.910 
a few other settings you can still click
on<00:01:20.610> your<00:01:20.729> icons<00:01:21.090> while<00:01:21.330> they're<00:01:21.479> like<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.920> so

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
on your icons while they're like that so

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.870 
on your icons while they're like that so
up<00:01:23.189> here<00:01:23.220> we<00:01:23.520> have<00:01:24.420> moon<00:01:25.159> zero<00:01:26.159> gravity<00:01:26.430> and

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
up here we have moon zero gravity and

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.980 
up here we have moon zero gravity and
custom<00:01:27.299> let's<00:01:27.869> go<00:01:28.020> over<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.229> moon<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:29.990> will

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
custom let's go over to moon and will

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.090 
custom let's go over to moon and will
activate<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.560> again<00:01:33.140> it's<00:01:34.140> just<00:01:34.290> much<00:01:34.590> slower

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
activate it again it's just much slower

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.550 
activate it again it's just much slower
but<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.400> still<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.290> basically<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.380> same

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
but it still is basically the same

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.620 
but it still is basically the same
concept<00:01:41.720> then<00:01:42.720> we<00:01:42.990> have<00:01:44.270> tap<00:01:45.270> on<00:01:45.450> settings

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
concept then we have tap on settings

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:54.270 
concept then we have tap on settings
again<00:01:46.490> zero<00:01:47.490> gravity<00:01:48.649> active<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.770> again<00:01:50.960> and

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.430 

it's<00:01:55.150> just<00:01:56.670> pretty<00:01:57.670> simple<00:01:58.090> they<00:01:58.299> won't<00:01:58.869> like

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
it's just pretty simple they won't like

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.340 
it's just pretty simple they won't like
stop<00:01:59.830> they'll<00:02:00.130> just<00:02:00.340> keep<00:02:00.520> moving<00:02:00.760> all<00:02:01.060> around

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
stop they'll just keep moving all around

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.260 
stop they'll just keep moving all around
so<00:02:02.350> let's<00:02:03.159> go<00:02:03.280> into<00:02:03.400> settings<00:02:03.850> and<00:02:03.940> then

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
so let's go into settings and then

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.719 
so let's go into settings and then
there's<00:02:04.479> custom<00:02:05.190> which<00:02:06.190> is<00:02:06.400> just<00:02:06.790> like<00:02:07.180> this

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
there's custom which is just like this

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.940 
there's custom which is just like this
activate<00:02:09.729> one<00:02:09.970> more<00:02:10.149> time<00:02:10.330> and<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.920> just

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
activate one more time and you just

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.190 
activate one more time and you just
basically<00:02:12.430> move<00:02:13.209> it<00:02:13.360> around<00:02:14.819> so<00:02:15.819> um<00:02:16.209> they're

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
basically move it around so um they're

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.520 
basically move it around so um they're
all<00:02:17.319> pretty<00:02:17.590> similar<00:02:17.890> but<00:02:18.130> it<00:02:18.970> is<00:02:19.690> a<00:02:19.900> pretty

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
all pretty similar but it is a pretty

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.040 
all pretty similar but it is a pretty
cool<00:02:20.800> tweak<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:21.400> I'm<00:02:22.270> also<00:02:22.510> going<00:02:22.810> to<00:02:22.870> show

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
cool tweak and I'm also going to show

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.070 
cool tweak and I'm also going to show
you<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.319> activation<00:02:24.010> methods<00:02:24.370> you<00:02:24.520> can<00:02:24.550> use

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
you the activation methods you can use

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.440 
you the activation methods you can use
so<00:02:26.080> you<00:02:26.110> can<00:02:26.769> activate<00:02:27.190> it<00:02:27.370> through<00:02:27.820> a<00:02:28.030> short

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
so you can activate it through a short

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.360 
so you can activate it through a short
hold<00:02:28.750> this<00:02:29.410> is<00:02:29.620> all<00:02:29.860> on<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.820> UM<00:02:31.680> via<00:02:32.680> activator

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
hold this is all on the UM via activator

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.220 
hold this is all on the UM via activator
all<00:02:33.610> these<00:02:34.000> you<00:02:34.360> have<00:02:34.510> all<00:02:34.660> of<00:02:35.080> these

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
all these you have all of these

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.190 
all these you have all of these
activation<00:02:36.100> methods<00:02:36.519> now<00:02:37.330> you<00:02:37.390> can<00:02:37.570> quickly

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
activation methods now you can quickly

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.420 
activation methods now you can quickly
toggle<00:02:38.530> on<00:02:38.830> and<00:02:38.950> off<00:02:40.170> so<00:02:41.170> um<00:02:41.500> there's<00:02:42.040> allow

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
toggle on and off so um there's allow

cool<00:02:55.050> again<00:02:56.050> it<00:02:56.319> is<00:02:56.380> pointless<00:02:57.160> as<00:02:57.519> to<00:02:58.390> like<00:02:58.630> it

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
cool again it is pointless as to like it

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.190 
cool again it is pointless as to like it

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
about it it's just brand new in cydia

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.460 
about it it's just brand new in cydia
and<00:03:10.959> go<00:03:11.590> check<00:03:11.799> it<00:03:11.890> out<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:12.810> it<00:03:13.810> works<00:03:14.019> in<00:03:14.230> both

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
orientations we just have to have to

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:22.229 
orientations we just have to have to
sybil<00:03:16.660> it<00:03:16.829> so<00:03:17.940> it<00:03:18.940> is<00:03:20.640> here<00:03:21.640> it<00:03:21.730> is<00:03:21.820> you're

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239

review of this tweak again doesn't

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.910 
review of this tweak again doesn't
really<00:04:14.060> provide<00:04:14.330> much<00:04:14.690> functionality<00:04:15.380> more

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
really provide much functionality more

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.420 
really provide much functionality more
than<00:04:16.130> it's<00:04:16.430> just<00:04:16.730> a<00:04:16.880> fun<00:04:17.150> little<00:04:17.180> tweak<00:04:18.130> but<00:04:19.130> it

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
than it's just a fun little tweak but it

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.220 
than it's just a fun little tweak but it
is<00:04:19.640> really<00:04:20.000> cool<00:04:20.209> that<00:04:20.690> it<00:04:20.840> uses<00:04:21.020> the

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
is really cool that it uses the

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.630 
is really cool that it uses the
accelerometer<00:04:21.920> and<00:04:24.100> especially<00:04:25.100> since<00:04:25.460> it's

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
accelerometer and especially since it's

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.440 
accelerometer and especially since it's
um<00:04:25.760> home<00:04:26.000> screen<00:04:26.420> Oh<00:04:26.770> so<00:04:27.770> anyway<00:04:28.730> guys<00:04:28.850> I<00:04:29.210> guess

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
um home screen Oh so anyway guys I guess

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.350 
um home screen Oh so anyway guys I guess
I'll<00:04:29.630> catch<00:04:29.810> you<00:04:30.080> in<00:04:30.200> the<00:04:30.260> next<00:04:30.320> video<00:04:31.030> so<00:04:32.030> that
