00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.250
 lemon pie with Swiss meringue 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.250
 ingredients 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.610
 implements to use 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.520
 before we start we will fly the cookies 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:24.000
 in a blender or processor 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:26.510
 we add lukewarm water 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.440
 and with the spatula we began to join 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:33.680
 until forming a mass 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.180
 to this mixture it is not necessary to add 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.400
 Butter 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.580
 Well, these cookies already contain 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.580
 enough 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.970
 concluded the mass is deposited in the 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.720
 mold 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.550
 and we begin to lower its volume 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.910
 using a spoon 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:58.710
 it is important to press hard so that 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.710
 the dough is very compact 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:06.020
 we have concluded now we take it to 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.830
 refrigerator for at least two 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:14.150
 hours before filling in the 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:18.050
 we prepare the filling we will use gelatin 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:21.520
 powder without flavor this box contains 4 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:25.280
 envelopes but we only need 2 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:29.090
 we deposit the hot water and add 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.820
 the 2 envelopes with gelatin and we started 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.450
 stir until it has dissolved by 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.450
 full 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.790
 we incorporate the lemon juice 

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:52.909
 we add liquid milk 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.400
 we incorporate condensed milk 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.619
 we beat until everything is integrated 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:21.510
 We tried the flavor and it was very good but 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:27.010
 If you want to modify it, this is the moment 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:30.459
 to incorporate sugar or lemon juice 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:33.939
 we deposit the filling which is 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:38.280
 spreads easily therefore it is not 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:38.280
 necessary to use a spatula 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:48.470
 concluded the filling we take to 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.470
 refrigerator until set 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.940
 We prepare the Swiss meringue for 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:59.050
 starting place a pot with water 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.810
 low flame in another smaller pot 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.930
 we deposit the clear ones we add the 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.930
 sugar 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.379
 and with a manual beater we stir a 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.379
 little bit 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.080
 once the water is hot without 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:20.890
 boil over the pot 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.990
 small and we will start to stir up 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.620
 that the sugar has dissolved by 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.620
 full 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:34.010
 the mixture will be ready when you feel 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:37.159
 soft to the touch with your fingers 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:40.670
 When this happens we deposit it in a 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:45.140
 bowl and we began to beat until reaching 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:48.939
 merengue volume is now ready position 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.939
 that when lifting it does not fall 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.790
 We turn to check the firmness of the 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.670
 Meringue 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.840
 concluded the meringue we removed from 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:09.379
 refrigerator the country to decorate it 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:13.079
 we empty the meringue and with the spatula 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:15.409
 we spread to form a surface 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.409
 smooth 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:27.150
 now we will begin to decorate we will use the 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.150
 pastry bag to form a heart 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:48.269
 we put a second layer of meringue 

00:04:43.709 --> 00:04:50.279
 so that the drawing of the heart stands out and 

00:04:48.269 --> 00:04:55.219
 to make it look more harmonious 

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:55.219
 we will draw an outer circle 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.530
 to achieve even browning is 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.680
 important to leave the drawing at the same 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.680
 level 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:15.310
 We last the meringue 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:18.100
 the golden one we do it only with heat 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:21.930
 superior so I recommend using 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:25.000
 grill or something similar if heat is applied 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:27.040
 ascending or wrapping runs the 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.430
 risk that the gelatin becomes 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.670
 liquid 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:36.410
 we review and arrange the country to 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.410
 achieve a homogeneous browning 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.920
 when we have finished we withdraw the 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.960
 country of the furnace and we take it to the 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.590
 refrigerator until the moment of 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.590
 serve it 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:56.990
 the lemon country also known as 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:59.900
 lemon pie or lemon pay dates from the 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:03.440
 medieval era in which it was served 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:06.440
 as dessert this dessert and contained the 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:09.440
 lemon was reserved for the most class 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:13.280
 well-off because the fruits were 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:15.740
 very expensive in the 17th century it 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:19.099
 perfect the meringue and from 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:21.819
 19th century is elaborated just as 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:21.819
 we know today 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:31.870
