00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.789
 developed a second person named leo 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:04.609
 Casper which is very very very 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:09.859
 likes to kill something that teaches either the whole game 

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:09.859
 500 mm bolt became 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.220

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.200
 [music] 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.180
 in short, one fine day mental hospital 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.460
 electricity is cut off all open 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.980
 the doors of the chambers that happens to revolt 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.320
 patients so daniel fall 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.540
 the magical world is brutalized by their psycho project 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.550
 peak man ok which will be stopped if 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.990
 no one will be and the truth 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.930
 never going outside 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.790
 shorter measurement that is necessary even if here and 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:57.220
 the script no one would break off 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:58.870
 really very 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.300
 [music] 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.970
 like 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.890
 [music] 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.569
 I have to be honest and chest or held once a 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.060
 all because if i sit down to play 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.370
 manhunt 2 not to pass 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.099
 mission to destroy always 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.599
 baht most sophisticated ways 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:18.890
 of which there are a whole bunch and here are just 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.890
 a small part of them 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.229
 [music] 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.370
 [music] 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.299
 well as you invigorate for no one 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.220
 the secret that manhunt 2 came out in 2007 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.880
 on playstation 2 and some more 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.640
 unknown 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.650
 and already the platform we swore appeared 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.900
 two years later essentially nothing 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.030
 exchanged except for one platformers 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.680
 versions at one time underwent the wildest 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.900
 censored due to which rockstar 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.459
 I had to blur the scenes each and every 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.100
 Generally it was not clear what was happening 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.290
 the on-screen version of the same to such campo 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.079
 problems did not suffer and you can do enough 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.420
 enjoy plastic cruelty with 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:18.209
 not expressing their emotions even when especially 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.900
 sophisticated were not the faces of enemies 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.900
 really funny 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.380
 now I personally played game mechanics 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.150
 manhunt 2 on the playstation 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.610
 time did not fully appreciate the charm and 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.890
 ease of killing enemies and everyday life 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.410
 I think the joystick is a bit sucking 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.360
 mouse button is now appreciating the game on 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.040
 comp I can firmly and confidently declare 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:05:06.550
 kill coins in a pis 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:08.980
 more fun and enjoyable gameplay 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.620
 the first part as a whole remains the same but 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:14.080
 he has grown at the same time with various innovations 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.300
 Perhaps the most important is killing the most 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.310
 sophisticated ones got koba made 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.840
 stuck mount in the back of the enemy 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.020
 turned a couple of times 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.270
 pulled pulled if in the first part of the player 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.980
 was the spectators insensitive process of execution 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.580
 in the second he is immediate 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.590
 executor 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.930
 move the mouse in given directions 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.000
 the player commits Calcese not on purpose except 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.710
 two protagonist learned to sit from the roof 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.750
 and beat in flight on the head of the mount 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.270
 some gaping enemy and 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.860
 else in certain places marked 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.200
 awards can use the environment 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.840
 for example to drown someone in the toilet 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:49.420
 hang it on the way to the power cable 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:52.680
 I still have a crusher like you 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.680
 expects berhan 2 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.209
 [music] 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.720
 range of piercing and cutting generous soul 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:09.000
 depleted weapons significantly 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.950
 increased during the game gaga in the first 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.290
 parts to replace knives and to walls soon 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:19.919
 Comes firearms who so likes whether 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:21.960
 Casper is pleased that the enemies in the second 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:24.270
 pieces manhunt have become smarter and become much 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.610
 more responsive to your appearances in 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.710
 field of view and the most important game world 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.830
 in which the character is brewed 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:34.169
 cesspool of worms with woodlice the most 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.479
 real hell on earth inhabited by the site and 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:38.940
 studios maniacs of all stripes completely 

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:41.580
 not inferior to patients mental hospital which 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.740
 we first hang out here and sadomasochist 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.990
 and in the basement Olya hostel in which they 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.510
 disappear their victims and the police on 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:50.970
 the streets are knocked off vagrants and thugs from 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.020
 face control snatching cats with tongs 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:55.110
 drunk poor guy 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:57.389
 Khovansky and other abominations on the background 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:59.669
 of all this is a beggar hero for whom 

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:03.320
 playing looks normal and all of it 

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:03.320
 action looks justified 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.310
 the funniest thing is that manhunt 2 failed 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:16.699
 censored and has been trimmed or withdrawn from 

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:19.620
 sales of five countries except Russia of course 

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:22.290
 here on the disk just small print 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:24.750
 it was written not recommended until 16 years 

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:26.580
 and you say I'm not saying that the game 

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:28.560
 mega cool in not like in all games 

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:30.389
 There are pros and cons 

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.590
 the only thing known for sure is 

00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:33.870
 topping up the movie saw 

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:36.449
 sometimes devour mafia heart to 

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:38.520
 down and drink down the anesthetic vesker 

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:39.210
 in max watering you should play 

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.520
 manhunt 2 

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:43.410
 it’s not even necessary to go through it 

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.960
 bail not watch chains and all yours 

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:48.090
 problems will resolve the main thing is not to repeat 

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.620
 all that you see in life by the way 

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:53.729
 circles of truth piispis 

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:56.520
