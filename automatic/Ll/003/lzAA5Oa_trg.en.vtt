right now for winning solar cue now this

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.369 
right now for winning solar cue now this
isn't<00:00:05.190> really<00:00:05.339> going<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:05.910> be<00:00:06.240> exactly<00:00:06.960> a<00:00:07.080> top

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
isn't really going to be exactly a top

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.230 
isn't really going to be exactly a top
five<00:00:07.649> like<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:08.069> other<00:00:08.280> roles<00:00:08.610> but<00:00:08.970> I'm<00:00:09.090> gonna

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
five like the other roles but I'm gonna

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.970 
five like the other roles but I'm gonna
split<00:00:09.570> them<00:00:09.750> into<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.349> different<00:00:10.710> play

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
split them into the different play

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.100 
split them into the different play
styles<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.700> support<00:00:12.090> has<00:00:12.300> which<00:00:12.809> are<00:00:12.960> best

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
styles the support has which are best

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.200 
styles the support has which are best
for<00:00:13.290> carrying<00:00:13.590> solar<00:00:13.860> Q<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.400> which<00:00:14.670> champions

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
for carrying solar Q and which champions

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.269 
for carrying solar Q and which champions
are<00:00:15.450> best<00:00:15.630> in<00:00:15.900> them<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.560> first<00:00:16.800> thing<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.220> think

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
are best in them the first thing I think

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.490 
are best in them the first thing I think
to<00:00:17.730> say<00:00:17.910> is<00:00:18.210> there<00:00:18.480> are<00:00:18.600> three<00:00:18.779> play<00:00:19.050> styles

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
to say is there are three play styles

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.109 
to say is there are three play styles
that<00:00:19.650> I<00:00:19.710> think<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.130> anyway<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:20.789> carry

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
that I think of anyway that carry

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.000 
that I think of anyway that carry
support<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.990> engage<00:00:22.260> support<00:00:22.740> any

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
support the engage support any

supportive support now carry supports

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.779 
supportive support now carry supports
have<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.410> lot<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.740> damage<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.340> they<00:00:26.460> tend<00:00:26.670> to

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
have a lot of damage and they tend to

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.150 
have a lot of damage and they tend to
kill<00:00:27.000> people<00:00:27.180> themselves<00:00:27.990> engage<00:00:28.590> supports

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
kill people themselves engage supports

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.279 
kill people themselves engage supports
start<00:00:29.460> fights<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.359> pretty<00:00:30.599> tanky<00:00:30.929> and

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
start fights and a pretty tanky and

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.380 
start fights and a pretty tanky and
supportive<00:00:32.099> supports<00:00:32.579> are<00:00:32.759> there<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:33.180> more

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
supportive supports are there to more

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.420 
supportive supports are there to more
help<00:00:33.630> their<00:00:33.809> team<00:00:34.050> than<00:00:34.290> anything<00:00:34.530> else<00:00:34.800> at

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
help their team than anything else at

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.340 
help their team than anything else at
lower<00:00:35.670> rankings<00:00:36.239> carry<00:00:36.719> supports<00:00:37.200> are

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
lower rankings carry supports are

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.290 
lower rankings carry supports are
probably<00:00:37.800> best<00:00:38.190> because<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.730> can<00:00:38.879> set<00:00:39.149> things

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
probably best because you can set things

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.030 
probably best because you can set things
up<00:00:39.510> yourself<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.469> can<00:00:40.620> have<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.800> real

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
up yourself and you can have a real

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.040 
up yourself and you can have a real
impact<00:00:41.219> in<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.790> game<00:00:42.000> especially<00:00:42.780> in<00:00:42.930> the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
impact in the game especially in the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.959 
impact in the game especially in the
laning<00:00:43.260> phase<00:00:43.379> now<00:00:44.010> as<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.309> get<00:00:44.399> higher<00:00:44.640> up

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
laning phase now as you get higher up

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.209 
laning phase now as you get higher up
and<00:00:45.180> your<00:00:45.450> team's<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:45.989> theory<00:00:46.320> get<00:00:46.469> better<00:00:46.739> and

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
and your team's in theory get better and

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.619 
and your team's in theory get better and
you<00:00:47.399> should<00:00:47.579> be<00:00:47.700> able<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.940> rely<00:00:48.329> on<00:00:48.360> them<00:00:48.600> a

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
you should be able to rely on them a

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.360 
you should be able to rely on them a
little<00:00:48.780> bit<00:00:48.960> more<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.710> engage<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.309> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
little bit more the engage and the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.160 
little bit more the engage and the
supportive<00:00:50.910> supports<00:00:51.390> are<00:00:51.539> going<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.020> get

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
supportive supports are going to get

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.439 
supportive supports are going to get
better<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.739> more<00:00:52.920> effective<00:00:53.460> okay<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.300> the

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
better and more effective okay so the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.420 
better and more effective okay so the
first<00:00:54.690> thing<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.140> basically<00:00:55.469> every<00:00:56.070> support

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
first thing is basically every support

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.610 
first thing is basically every support
right<00:00:56.579> now<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.910> okay<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.899> can<00:00:58.140> play<00:00:58.410> them

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
right now is okay and you can play them

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.680 
right now is okay and you can play them
and<00:00:58.800> win<00:00:59.039> games<00:00:59.309> but<00:00:59.579> these<00:01:00.030> are<00:01:00.210> going<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.449> be

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
and win games but these are going to be

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.630 
and win games but these are going to be
my<00:01:00.960> opinion<00:01:01.260> on<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.739> highest<00:01:01.980> impact

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
my opinion on the highest impact

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.119 
my opinion on the highest impact
supports<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:03.960> first<00:01:04.199> up<00:01:04.379> let's<00:01:04.559> look<00:01:04.650> at<00:01:04.830> carry

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
supports so first up let's look at carry

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.280 
supports so first up let's look at carry
supports<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.210> best<00:01:06.360> one<00:01:06.540> here<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.990> going

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
supports and the best one here is going

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.710 
supports and the best one here is going
to<00:01:07.409> be<00:01:07.530> an<00:01:07.770> e<00:01:07.799> by<00:01:08.130> far<00:01:08.460> now<00:01:08.970> an<00:01:09.180> e<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.360> really

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
to be an e by far now an e is really

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.690 
to be an e by far now an e is really
effective<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.320> soloqueue<00:01:10.799> because<00:01:11.310> she<00:01:11.460> has

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
effective in soloqueue because she has

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.969 
effective in soloqueue because she has
so<00:01:11.970> much<00:01:12.180> damage<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.780> crowd<00:01:13.260> control<00:01:13.290> she's

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
so much damage and crowd control she's

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.740 
so much damage and crowd control she's
really<00:01:14.310> effective<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.909> lane<00:01:15.119> phase<00:01:15.420> and

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
really effective in the lane phase and

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.600 
really effective in the lane phase and
she<00:01:15.930> also<00:01:16.140> transitions<00:01:16.890> into<00:01:17.250> meet<00:01:17.430> game

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
she also transitions into meet game

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.730 
she also transitions into meet game
teamfights<00:01:18.150> really<00:01:18.540> well<00:01:18.750> as<00:01:18.900> well<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.590> good

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
teamfights really well as well the good

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.770 
teamfights really well as well the good
thing<00:01:19.799> with<00:01:20.070> an<00:01:20.310> E<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.729> her<00:01:21.060> damage<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.659> is

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
thing with an E is her damage that is

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.719 
thing with an E is her damage that is
her<00:01:21.930> biggest<00:01:22.170> plus<00:01:22.530> as<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.770> support<00:01:23.310> because

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
her biggest plus as a support because

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.730 
her biggest plus as a support because
she<00:01:23.880> can<00:01:24.030> basically<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.570> hundred<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:25.140> zero<00:01:25.380> an

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
she can basically a hundred to zero an

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.280 
she can basically a hundred to zero an
enemy<00:01:26.040> ad<00:01:26.189> carry<00:01:26.610> if<00:01:27.000> she<00:01:27.270> gets<00:01:27.479> fed<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.080> this

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
enemy ad carry if she gets fed and this

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.230 
enemy ad carry if she gets fed and this
is<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.470> really<00:01:28.829> good<00:01:29.130> advantage<00:01:29.460> for<00:01:29.909> your<00:01:30.030> team

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
is a really good advantage for your team

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.149 
is a really good advantage for your team
to<00:01:30.270> have<00:01:30.630> I've<00:01:31.290> mentioned<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.799> she<00:01:31.979> has<00:01:32.130> a

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
to have I've mentioned that she has a

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.920 
to have I've mentioned that she has a
good<00:01:32.369> Lane<00:01:32.610> phase<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.509> one<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
good Lane phase and that is one of the

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.510 
good Lane phase and that is one of the
strongest<00:01:34.320> things<00:01:34.590> because<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.130> can<00:01:35.280> bully

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
strongest things because you can bully

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.980 
strongest things because you can bully
your<00:01:35.700> opponents<00:01:36.210> with<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.479> threat<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.810> the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
your opponents with the threat of the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.780 
your opponents with the threat of the
stun<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.650> damage<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.159> bring<00:01:38.430> if<00:01:38.670> you

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
stun and the damage you bring if you

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.550 
stun and the damage you bring if you
take<00:01:38.970> ignite<00:01:39.390> as<00:01:39.600> well<00:01:39.869> then<00:01:40.110> it's<00:01:40.259> really

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
take ignite as well then it's really

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.469 
take ignite as well then it's really
easy<00:01:40.740> for<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.189> pick<00:01:41.460> up<00:01:41.549> kills<00:01:41.880> especially

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
easy for you to pick up kills especially

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.630 
easy for you to pick up kills especially
at<00:01:42.570> level<00:01:42.810> six<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.829> downsides<00:01:44.280> are<00:01:44.430> playing

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
at level six the downsides are playing

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.760 
at level six the downsides are playing
an<00:01:44.850> e<00:01:44.880> though<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.390> if<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.659> do<00:01:45.869> get<00:01:46.049> behind<00:01:46.259> then

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
an e though is if you do get behind then

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.440 
an e though is if you do get behind then
you<00:01:46.860> are<00:01:46.979> just<00:01:47.250> basically<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.729> stumble<00:01:48.329> you

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
you are just basically a stumble you

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.539 
you are just basically a stumble you
become<00:01:48.780> very<00:01:48.960> squishy<00:01:49.350> very<00:01:49.799> easy<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.310> kill

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
become very squishy very easy to kill

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.340 
become very squishy very easy to kill

you don't have much damage and the only
thing<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.619> can<00:01:52.799> do<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.100> stun<00:01:53.430> if<00:01:53.880> you've<00:01:54.240> been

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
their ad carry win the lane and Thresh

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.650 
their ad carry win the lane and Thresh
does<00:02:43.860> that<00:02:44.010> perfectly<00:02:44.580> now<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.120> slightly<00:02:45.420> more

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
does that perfectly now a slightly more

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.750 
does that perfectly now a slightly more
riskier<00:02:46.140> pick<00:02:46.410> I<00:02:46.590> guess<00:02:46.800> than<00:02:47.040> Thresh<00:02:47.340> is<00:02:47.580> the

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
riskier pick I guess than Thresh is the

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.070 
riskier pick I guess than Thresh is the
Leona<00:02:48.209> she<00:02:48.390> doesn't<00:02:48.630> really<00:02:48.750> have<00:02:48.989> the

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
Leona she doesn't really have the

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.440 
Leona she doesn't really have the
defensive<00:02:49.560> capabilities<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.550> Thresh<00:02:51.000> but<00:02:51.300> her

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
defensive capabilities of Thresh but her

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.390 
defensive capabilities of Thresh but her
offensive<00:02:52.050> capabilities<00:02:52.800> are<00:02:53.040> actually

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
offensive capabilities are actually

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.370 
offensive capabilities are actually
better<00:02:53.610> she<00:02:54.269> can<00:02:54.390> engage<00:02:54.690> throughout<00:02:55.230> the

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
better she can engage throughout the

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.199 
better she can engage throughout the
early<00:02:55.620> lane<00:02:55.800> phase<00:02:56.100> and<00:02:56.280> it's<00:02:56.370> much<00:02:56.640> easier<00:02:57.030> to

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
early lane phase and it's much easier to

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.030 
early lane phase and it's much easier to
do<00:02:57.390> than<00:02:57.570> Thresh<00:02:57.930> she<00:02:58.200> also<00:02:58.350> has<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.800> bonus

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
do than Thresh she also has the bonus

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.009 
do than Thresh she also has the bonus
damage<00:02:59.370> with<00:02:59.670> her<00:02:59.790> passive<00:03:00.269> there's<00:03:00.480> actually

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
damage with her passive there's actually

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.600 
damage with her passive there's actually
really<00:03:01.410> strong<00:03:01.680> early<00:03:01.890> and<00:03:02.340> her<00:03:02.459> ultimate

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
really strong early and her ultimate

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.420 
really strong early and her ultimate
level<00:03:03.209> six<00:03:03.569> is<00:03:03.780> really<00:03:04.140> dangerous<00:03:04.319> the<00:03:05.250> one

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
level six is really dangerous the one

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.340 
level six is really dangerous the one
bad<00:03:05.700> thing<00:03:05.730> with<00:03:06.060> Leona<00:03:06.510> is<00:03:06.660> that<00:03:06.900> if<00:03:06.989> you<00:03:07.110> have

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
bad thing with Leona is that if you have

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.530 
bad thing with Leona is that if you have
a<00:03:07.380> passive<00:03:07.920> ad<00:03:08.069> carry<00:03:08.519> either<00:03:08.819> someone<00:03:09.330> who's

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
a passive ad carry either someone who's

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.990 
a passive ad carry either someone who's
just<00:03:09.810> passive<00:03:10.260> by<00:03:10.380> nature<00:03:10.830> like<00:03:11.040> a<00:03:11.069> vane<00:03:11.400> or<00:03:11.730> if

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
just passive by nature like a vane or if

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.970 
just passive by nature like a vane or if
you're<00:03:12.150> just<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.450> ad<00:03:12.660> carry<00:03:13.050> themselves<00:03:13.350> is

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
you're just the ad carry themselves is

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.380 
you're just the ad carry themselves is
passive<00:03:14.459> then<00:03:14.700> you're<00:03:14.850> gonna<00:03:15.000> have<00:03:15.180> a<00:03:15.209> bad

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
passive then you're gonna have a bad

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.240 
passive then you're gonna have a bad
time<00:03:15.450> because<00:03:16.080> you<00:03:16.170> can't<00:03:16.440> really<00:03:16.590> fire<00:03:16.920> and

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
time because you can't really fire and

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.920 
time because you can't really fire and
Leona<00:03:17.670> doesn't<00:03:18.000> really<00:03:18.120> do<00:03:18.329> anything<00:03:18.630> if

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
Leona doesn't really do anything if

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.960 
Leona doesn't really do anything if
you're<00:03:19.049> not<00:03:19.200> fighting<00:03:19.470> if<00:03:20.190> you<00:03:20.310> do<00:03:20.489> get<00:03:20.700> ahead

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
you're not fighting if you do get ahead

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.910 
you're not fighting if you do get ahead
then<00:03:21.239> you<00:03:21.329> can<00:03:21.480> keep<00:03:21.690> fighting<00:03:22.140> over<00:03:22.500> and<00:03:22.650> over

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
then you can keep fighting over and over

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.350 
then you can keep fighting over and over
you<00:03:23.070> can<00:03:23.220> smoke<00:03:23.549> with<00:03:23.760> your<00:03:23.880> advantage<00:03:24.329> so

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
you can smoke with your advantage so

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.150 
you can smoke with your advantage so
well<00:03:24.810> with<00:03:24.989> your<00:03:25.079> ultimate<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:25.860> your

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
ultimate in teamfights is really strong

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.660 
ultimate in teamfights is really strong
one<00:03:28.650> thing<00:03:28.799> that<00:03:28.890> is<00:03:28.980> really<00:03:29.010> good<00:03:29.459> in

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
one thing that is really good in

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.310 
one thing that is really good in
soloqueue<00:03:30.180> is<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.600> ability<00:03:30.810> to<00:03:30.989> engage

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
soloqueue is the ability to engage

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.410 
soloqueue is the ability to engage
especially<00:03:32.100> at<00:03:32.220> lower<00:03:32.400> ELO's<00:03:32.760> where<00:03:33.030> people

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
especially at lower ELO's where people

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.150 
especially at lower ELO's where people
position<00:03:33.959> really<00:03:34.230> badly<00:03:34.470> on<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:34.860> enemy<00:03:35.130> team

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
position really badly on the enemy team

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.160 
position really badly on the enemy team
and<00:03:35.519> you<00:03:35.579> can<00:03:35.700> catch<00:03:35.910> them<00:03:36.090> out<00:03:36.299> and<00:03:36.510> also<00:03:37.019> your

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
and you can catch them out and also your

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.870 
and you can catch them out and also your
team<00:03:37.410> just<00:03:37.709> doesn't<00:03:37.980> really<00:03:38.220> engage<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.700> kind

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
team just doesn't really engage to kind

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.220 
team just doesn't really engage to kind
of<00:03:38.970> sit<00:03:39.180> back<00:03:39.209> and<00:03:39.390> wait<00:03:39.660> for<00:03:39.690> something<00:03:40.049> to

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
of sit back and wait for something to

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.080 
of sit back and wait for something to
happen<00:03:40.380> well<00:03:41.010> you<00:03:41.040> can<00:03:41.400> actually<00:03:41.700> make<00:03:41.940> that

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
happen well you can actually make that

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.729 
happen well you can actually make that
thing<00:03:42.329> happen<00:03:42.390> so<00:03:43.260> that's<00:03:43.410> actually<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.709> good

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
thing happen so that's actually a good

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.770 
thing happen so that's actually a good
point<00:03:44.220> to<00:03:44.459> move<00:03:44.640> on<00:03:44.820> to<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.209> supporting

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
point to move on to the supporting

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.630 
point to move on to the supporting
supports<00:03:46.260> because<00:03:46.410> these<00:03:46.799> supports<00:03:47.280> can't

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
supports because these supports can't

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.670 
supports because these supports can't
really<00:03:47.850> make<00:03:48.120> things<00:03:48.329> happen<00:03:48.480> as<00:03:49.019> much<00:03:49.049> they

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
really make things happen as much they

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.170 
really make things happen as much they
kind<00:03:49.890> of<00:03:49.980> rely<00:03:50.220> on<00:03:50.250> their<00:03:50.459> team<00:03:50.670> to<00:03:50.850> do<00:03:51.000> that

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
kind of rely on their team to do that

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.670 
kind of rely on their team to do that
but<00:03:51.390> they<00:03:51.450> are<00:03:51.480> very<00:03:51.900> very<00:03:52.350> good<00:03:52.560> at

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
but they are very very good at

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.289 
but they are very very good at
protecting<00:03:53.040> that<00:03:53.340> team<00:03:53.579> and<00:03:53.850> keeping<00:03:54.180> them

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
protecting that team and keeping them

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:54.920 
protecting that team and keeping them
alive

teamfights it's really hard to get on to

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.349 
teamfights it's really hard to get on to
a<00:04:16.739> team<00:04:17.039> that<00:04:17.070> has<00:04:17.459> a<00:04:17.489> Janna<00:04:17.789> on<00:04:17.970> them<00:04:18.209> because

Janna is that unlike the other supports
I<00:04:30.870> mentioned<00:04:31.320> if<00:04:31.440> you<00:04:31.500> get<00:04:31.770> behind<00:04:31.920> you<00:04:32.340> can

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
I mentioned if you get behind you can

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.430 
I mentioned if you get behind you can
still<00:04:32.760> have<00:04:32.970> a<00:04:33.000> good<00:04:33.210> impact<00:04:33.600> in<00:04:33.780> the<00:04:33.870> game<00:04:34.110> but

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
still have a good impact in the game but

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.440 
still have a good impact in the game but
only<00:04:34.650> if<00:04:34.890> your<00:04:35.010> team<00:04:35.280> is<00:04:35.310> still<00:04:35.700> ahead<00:04:35.850> if<00:04:36.330> your

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
only if your team is still ahead if your

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.570 
only if your team is still ahead if your
team<00:04:36.780> is<00:04:36.810> behind<00:04:37.110> then<00:04:37.650> you<00:04:37.890> can't<00:04:38.220> really<00:04:38.370> do

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
team is behind then you can't really do

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.550 
team is behind then you can't really do
anything<00:04:38.910> because<00:04:39.270> keeping<00:04:39.810> a<00:04:39.900> weak<00:04:40.110> person

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
anything because keeping a weak person

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.190 
anything because keeping a weak person
alive<00:04:40.830> is<00:04:41.130> no<00:04:41.430> rule<00:04:41.640> use<00:04:41.940> the<00:04:42.600> other<00:04:42.750> person

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
alive is no rule use the other person

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.710 
alive is no rule use the other person
here<00:04:43.440> is<00:04:43.680> going<00:04:43.920> to<00:04:44.010> kind<00:04:44.520> of<00:04:44.760> actually<00:04:44.970> be<00:04:45.390> of

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
here is going to kind of actually be of

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.200 
here is going to kind of actually be of
cross<00:04:46.110> between<00:04:46.320> all<00:04:46.710> three<00:04:47.280> so<00:04:47.520> she's<00:04:47.730> kind<00:04:48.060> of

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
cross between all three so she's kind of

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.270 
cross between all three so she's kind of
carry<00:04:48.450> she's<00:04:48.780> kind<00:04:49.080> of<00:04:49.230> engaged<00:04:49.590> and<00:04:49.860> she<00:04:49.980> kind

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
carry she's kind of engaged and she kind

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.710 
carry she's kind of engaged and she kind
of<00:04:50.370> supports<00:04:50.760> it<00:04:50.850> as<00:04:50.940> well<00:04:51.150> and<00:04:51.360> that's<00:04:51.450> going

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
of supports it as well and that's going

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.700 
of supports it as well and that's going
to<00:04:51.900> be<00:04:51.990> Sona

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
to be Sona

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.410 
to be Sona
now<00:04:52.860> the<00:04:52.950> reason<00:04:53.250> Sona<00:04:53.520> is<00:04:53.730> here<00:04:53.970> is<00:04:54.120> because

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
now the reason Sona is here is because

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.150 
now the reason Sona is here is because
she<00:04:54.510> does<00:04:54.690> all<00:04:54.870> three<00:04:55.200> pretty<00:04:55.560> well<00:04:55.860> and<00:04:56.100> so

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
she does all three pretty well and so

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.830 
she does all three pretty well and so
you<00:04:56.280> can<00:04:56.400> actually<00:04:56.520> have<00:04:56.760> an<00:04:56.880> overall<00:04:57.390> high

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
you can actually have an overall high

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.080 
you can actually have an overall high
impact<00:04:58.290> in<00:04:58.440> the<00:04:58.530> game<00:04:58.740> in<00:04:59.160> Lane<00:04:59.640> she's<00:04:59.910> very

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
impact in the game in Lane she's very

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.880 
impact in the game in Lane she's very
supporting<00:05:00.690> in<00:05:00.780> the<00:05:00.870> way<00:05:00.990> she<00:05:01.200> can<00:05:01.350> healer<00:05:01.650> ad

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
supporting in the way she can healer ad

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.010 
supporting in the way she can healer ad
carry<00:05:02.250> and<00:05:02.370> heal<00:05:02.880> them<00:05:03.030> back<00:05:03.180> up<00:05:03.360> after<00:05:03.540> trade

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
carry and heal them back up after trade

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.080 
carry and heal them back up after trade
so<00:05:04.320> if<00:05:04.440> your<00:05:04.560> ad<00:05:04.740> isn't<00:05:05.160> as<00:05:05.400> good<00:05:05.640> then<00:05:05.940> you<00:05:06.060> can

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
so if your ad isn't as good then you can

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.490 
so if your ad isn't as good then you can
kind<00:05:06.480> of<00:05:06.570> nurse<00:05:06.810> them<00:05:07.050> through<00:05:07.230> the<00:05:07.320> lane

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
kind of nurse them through the lane

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.680 
kind of nurse them through the lane
phrase<00:05:07.800> and<00:05:08.040> at<00:05:08.100> least<00:05:08.220> let<00:05:08.430> them<00:05:08.580> farm<00:05:08.910> on<00:05:09.420> the

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
phrase and at least let them farm on the

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.480 
phrase and at least let them farm on the
flip<00:05:09.900> side<00:05:09.930> her<00:05:10.380> Q<00:05:10.620> actually<00:05:11.040> kind<00:05:11.280> of<00:05:11.310> makes

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
flip side her Q actually kind of makes

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.160 
flip side her Q actually kind of makes
her<00:05:11.640> carry<00:05:12.030> support<00:05:12.420> in<00:05:12.540> Lane<00:05:12.750> as<00:05:12.990> well

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
her carry support in Lane as well

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.750 
her carry support in Lane as well
because<00:05:13.500> it<00:05:13.620> does<00:05:13.770> a<00:05:13.800> lot<00:05:13.890> of<00:05:14.040> damage<00:05:14.340> it's<00:05:14.670> a

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
because it does a lot of damage it's a

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.220 
because it does a lot of damage it's a
lot<00:05:14.910> of<00:05:15.030> poke<00:05:15.240> and<00:05:15.510> it's<00:05:15.630> hard<00:05:15.840> to<00:05:15.990> deal<00:05:16.200> with

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
lot of poke and it's hard to deal with

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.050 
lot of poke and it's hard to deal with
if<00:05:16.470> they<00:05:16.590> don't<00:05:16.830> have<00:05:17.040> a<00:05:17.070> heel<00:05:17.340> support<00:05:17.610> on<00:05:17.970> the

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
if they don't have a heel support on the

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.480 
if they don't have a heel support on the
enemy<00:05:18.330> team<00:05:18.380> finally<00:05:19.380> ultimate<00:05:20.040> is<00:05:20.190> better

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
enemy team finally ultimate is better

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.310 
enemy team finally ultimate is better
for<00:05:20.790> re-engage<00:05:21.330> than<00:05:21.570> it<00:05:21.690> is<00:05:21.750> for<00:05:21.960> engaging

for re-engage than it is for engaging

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.170 
for re-engage than it is for engaging
because<00:05:22.680> you'd<00:05:23.010> have<00:05:23.040> to<00:05:23.310> blow<00:05:23.490> your<00:05:23.520> flash<00:05:23.910> -

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
because you'd have to blow your flash -

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.210 
because you'd have to blow your flash -
flash<00:05:24.210> and<00:05:24.660> engage<00:05:24.930> but<00:05:25.470> if<00:05:25.590> the<00:05:25.770> enemy<00:05:26.040> team

flash and engage but if the enemy team
engage<00:05:26.820> onto<00:05:27.090> you<00:05:27.450> then<00:05:27.720> you<00:05:27.840> can<00:05:28.050> get<00:05:28.200> a<00:05:28.260> good

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
engage onto you then you can get a good

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.200 
engage onto you then you can get a good
ultimate<00:05:28.950> onto<00:05:29.250> them<00:05:29.460> to<00:05:29.760> re-engage<00:05:30.030> with

ultimate onto them to re-engage with
your<00:05:30.540> team<00:05:30.750> and<00:05:30.960> it's<00:05:31.080> actually<00:05:31.350> a<00:05:31.410> really

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
your team and it's actually a really

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.100 
your team and it's actually a really
high<00:05:31.980> impact<00:05:32.190> ultimate<00:05:32.940> so<00:05:33.690> those<00:05:33.870> are<00:05:34.020> going

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
high impact ultimate so those are going

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.870 
high impact ultimate so those are going
to<00:05:34.170> be<00:05:34.290> the<00:05:34.410> best<00:05:34.620> ones<00:05:34.860> in<00:05:35.100> each<00:05:35.310> three<00:05:35.580> of<00:05:35.760> the

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
roles and now we're going to move on to

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.960 
roles and now we're going to move on to
the<00:05:37.620> pocket<00:05:38.070> picks<00:05:38.310> and<00:05:38.520> these<00:05:38.610> are<00:05:38.760> kind<00:05:38.940> of
