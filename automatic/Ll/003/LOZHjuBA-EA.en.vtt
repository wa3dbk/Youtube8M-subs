00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.320
 continues adding goals and helping the team 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.810
 to score points only two minutes later 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.640
 juanfran in word this center from the 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.980
 left from venice but the ball finished 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.980
 going to corner after crossing the 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.780
 visitor defender the host did not want 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.060
 come down and through dani 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.180
 pacheco was looking for a draw but matteo is 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.800
 very attentive he avoided greater evils and 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.450
 that was really bad for those of 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.579
 D'Alessandro was this goal d 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.890
 a robbery in the center of juanfran 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:13.409
 and another against the very fast of the castle 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.539
 behind the wall with borja again the 2 is 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.850
 release of 18 for him to write the 2 a 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:19.950
 0 with which he would come to rest 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.110
 a goal that did a lot of damage to a 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.210
 Huesca that he saw as speed and 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.700
 quality of the homegrown players had finished 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.159
 with all his initial plans and also 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.140
 the strength behind because the seriousness 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.380
 defensive team was fundamental 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.090
 to add the castilla could go with 3 a 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.520
 0 to the locker room but this shot of 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.560
 hesse went away for very little after 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.299
 the pass to the casimiro hole that he saw 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.069
 perfectly the movement of the canary 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.979
 he could not finish in goal but after 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:48.959
 there would be more despite the fact that the Huesca 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.970
 they came ready to everything in the second 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:52.890
 half again it proved that 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.649
 you need half an opportunity to make a 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.229
 so very attentive to the rejects he returned to 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.539
 turn another into a goal in minute 14 of 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.729
 the restart take out of corner that 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.679
 cleared the defense of the Huesca fished at 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.959
 hesse bolo and sent pegadita to the stick 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:08.549
 so that it was impossible to stop for 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:10.709
 luís garcía 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.940
 urged by his need the Huesca 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.310
 tried the heroic 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.770
 ja gonzález newly incorporated and to pass 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.500
 de pacheco achieved 31 for his team 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.150
 three minutes later the other erases the 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.340
 our failed to finish between the 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.740
 three clubs after the play and pass of 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.230
 juanfran and let pass denis shot 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.300
 above but the result was going to grow 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.910
 allex, which had replaced 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.400
 that in 62 he got this foul he had 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.800
 Carlos Lazaro was ultimately the 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.720
 4-1 for a castilla that took advantage of 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.390
 occasions and kept order and 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.340
 tranquility and when there was no of that 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.440
 Thomas was that in just a minute 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.420
 he made two stops of great merit for 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.250
 avoid that those of d'alessandro had 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.060
 a minimum option to get something positive 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.070
 del di stéfano already in the discount lukas 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.350
 put the fifth taking advantage of a ball 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.210
 dead in the area 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.220
 the previous shot of borja had it 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.350
 removed from above luis garcía and the 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.950
 Galician controlled and finished as it fell 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.270
 to sign the definitive 5 to 1 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.670
 intractable again at home the castle 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.630
