 Today it goes apex and so pixie 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.050
 this is a character from the game manhunt believing in 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.090
 the fact that he is a pig he wore a pig's head 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.059
 poured principle pig well and 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.010

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.620
 all unwanted scattered dollars here 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.140
 Well, those who let him not like 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.370

 handed over there is such a hut and 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.650
 the legend is that with the guard but to come 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.150
 it will be possible to contemplate 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.580
 this pixie that will be on you 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.350
 attack and try to dunk you 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.950
 Well we start the investigation went there 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.950
 forward 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.360
 that's the principle on what is in place let's 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.350
 wait for the night and start looking 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.350
 pixie 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.200

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.460
 period of these hours can be stubborn spears 3 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.280
 do Well let's look for run 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.950
 let us reach a 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.300
 we meet him with bread and salt 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.730
 Of course we will not practice with 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.630
 with bread and salt meet with guns and 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.280
 Kalash 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.280

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.080
 for now nothing but they go on continue 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.080
 search 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.930
 and nothing guys really like that 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.760
 ran for a long time but I run a pixie 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.270
 unfortunately it was not possible to shoot 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.380
 and I may not even know okay failed 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.010
 and failed but 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:58.400
 but worth the guys pay attention to 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.140
 current miffin one this is traces yes it is 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.220

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.650
 attention is the same there is not the same 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.790
 Well, I do not know for sure this apex would you 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.620
 or who I do not know, but there are traces 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.390
 trail see a small saddle 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.060
 much smaller half even somewhere in 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.050
 times 2 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.240
 so it can only say that 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.650
 one that it really is a pixie track and 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.870
 I also want to show you one very much 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.100

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.330

 actually these sounds are gone and 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:22.600

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.750
 hypixel yes these two factors if hold o 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.580
 that the pixie in the game exists and he 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.110
