00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.690

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.770
 this new video tutorial 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.990
 start immediately by applying a primer for 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.820
 eyes both on the fixed eyelid and 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.710
 on the mobile and later 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.400
 withdrawal from this beautiful colleagues 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.510
 urban decay this old rose 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.170
 intermediate that I am going to spread over all 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.170
 my eyelid 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.220
 after blending this first color 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.700
 I'm going to stretch out only in the fold 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.950
 of the eye a purple plum always 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.410
 satin and proceeding slowly 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.090
 blending penis this color ratio 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.160
 purple also in the lower part 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.930
 using a smaller brush e 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.190
 subsequently going to blend everything 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.190
 with a clean brush 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.070
 after spreading these colors well 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:26.679
 I'm going to light up my arch 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.469
 eyebrows use a cream color 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:31.210
 matt and I'm going to spread it fading and 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:33.670
 mixing it with penis that has purple 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.920
 used previously not happy 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.659
 to further intensify the fold 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.909
 I'm going to spread this color 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.399
 plum amat even more intense respect 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.079
 to the one used previously and there 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.060
 emblem with a smaller brush 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:48.369
 only in the outer corner of the eye for 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.619
 giving greater intensity is preferred 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.360
 to my eyes a bit of this color 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.399
 also in the lower part of the eye 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.989
 and then I help myself with one 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.149
 plum-colored pencil to go to 

00:01:55.989 --> 00:02:00.360
 further intensify my rhyme 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.360
 lower 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.570
 and now 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.500
 I can only trace a beautiful one 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.630
 eyeliner line with outdoor kitchen that 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.730
 stretches the eye upwards and keeps 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.620
 this line quite thin while 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.350
 in the inner rim of the eye I go to 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.630
 apply a black house in this case 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.850
 I use the row in the mach that is 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.890
 really super super black and 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.230
 then illuminate my corner 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.690
 inside with this make up light 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.880
 up revolution that is use for both 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.740
 eyes but also on the face and before 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.300
 conclude the make-up of the eyes I go to 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.610
 spread a little bit of concealer for 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.480
 correct my dark circles and redefine 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.130
 all make up 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.590
 I just have to apply my eyelashes e 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.209
 apply plenty of mascara as always 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.470
 both in the upper part and in the 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.470
 lower part of the eye 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.070
 passing instead to make-up of the face 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.840
 I apply the same illuminant used 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.880
 in the inner corner of the eye above the 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.650
 my cheekbone and then below 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.110
 always this beautiful beautiful 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.390
 plage of essence super rosÃ© that 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.790
 I think it's very spring and e 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.410
 looks very good on light skins like 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.540
 my 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.060
 finally I put a lipstick on my lips 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.790
 always shiny with a pinkish hue and 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.570
 a gloss in this case transparent with 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.730
 glitter above even the look of 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.590
