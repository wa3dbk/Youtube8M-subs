00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello tankers and all those who are 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.470
 wants to be at the microphone zogan and you 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.780
 See insane experience and transfer to 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.269
 which we prove and do not show 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.280
 tactical decisions are applicable in combat 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:19.220
 and also trying to test for strength 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:22.199
 our game with you today in the program 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:27.140
 explosive jump vertical shooting and 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.140
 drop blue hawk go 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.860
 e100 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.780
 fv 183 hammer and anvil combination 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.030
 which has repeatedly shown and 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.489
 proved in a lot of interesting 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.890
 phenomena associated with the explosion boeukladki 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.930
 but today we decided to check not how 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.479
 will explode used to and that as from 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.399
 the flying tower behaves in the air that 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:57.949
 will be if at the time of blasting the tank over 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.379
 a tank flies another tank will affect whether 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:05.360
 clash with games by me tower on his 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:07.820
 flight path as a jumper of course 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.679
 same elsie and mx his task is complete 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.490
 speed jump to 2 100 at the time 

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:14.030
 undermining bk 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:18.399
 Well, fv 183 should be bullet timing 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:21.289
 a gray giant for a beautiful firework 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:23.450
 the first jump and the tree makes triple 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:26.090
 sheepskin in the air than earns himself 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.670
 champion title in olympic tank 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.069
 games at the same time proving that during 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:40.640
 free fall is better not to cling 

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:42.409
 alien stranded towers in second experience 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.619
 we decided to try to shoot 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.299
 and upside down and strictly down for 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.520
 this we took the Chinese wazik and 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:54.649
 neatly set him stern to heaven 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.299
 the essence of the experiment can just figure out 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.039
 whether the tank is set vertically 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.259
 shoot at the ground when his guns 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.420
 completely go under the texture well, suddenly 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.979
 you will need al-Chaluf to throw a shell 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.119
 through the core of the earth onto some highway 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.399
 checking for sure that the tank is capable 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.829
 shoot the building coming close to it and 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.720
 having completely hidden our weapons in it we 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:16.340
 started to implement our plan 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.109
 once horizontally covering the cannon 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.299
 the textures of the building shoot it turns out 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:22.450
 most likely it will be possible to shoot in 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:25.370
 the ground 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.320
 However, as strong as our mighty vazik 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.900
 nor puffed up and his tank commander did not 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:35.209
 screamed fire to shoot through 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.799
 a planet fails once your 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.750
 the barrel comes in more than one third 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.730
 under the ground to press the left finger 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.340
 the mouse button is absolutely useless 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.450
 shooting is blocked so how would you 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.920
 nor tried to help 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.080
 to my friend on the next map 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.670
 shoot through the ground you haven't 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:55.910
 come out here for dessert today is waiting for you 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.980
 something amazing and unique personally 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.349
 no matter how hard I try 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.510
 it never happened in all five years that I 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.730
 I play tanks you probably know about 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.739
 that in our game very rarely happen 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.260
 Such situations when you completely 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.239
 destroy the tank crew and you can't 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.670
 continue the battle although the tank itself remains 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.980
 almost unscathed so here are our flyers on 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.950
 Christmas trees this time surpassed themselves and 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:23.510
 proved to the world that even though you 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:26.000
 Now you see for yourself we have learned 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.760
 I wonder if the tank can be withdrawn 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.190
 out of action by killing the crew inside 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.190
 is it possible to destroy the poor type 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:38.209
 jumping from somewhere high up and smack 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:40.370
 tank ground one of the highest 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.060
 springboards of our game are on the map 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.579
 himmelsdorf 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:48.799
 And the tasks of a beautiful jump without a parachute 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:50.540
 no one can do better than a Christmas tree 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.359
 sleepless nights our desperate 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:57.760
 to prove or segal and into the abyss and all 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:04:00.980
 to no avail and now after a huge 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:06.410
 amount of coffee drunk and innumerable 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:07.880
 the number of attempts they managed wbr bravely 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:12.069
 hovering over our flyers 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.069
 and let them do the impossible 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.900
 after the next jump having fallen on the pavement 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.940
 near the legendary banana one of the trees 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.100
 I received such a message 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.889
 crew destroyed by strong 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.340
 strike and also in combat chat highlighted 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:30.650
 reports that the crew of the tank 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.990
 destroyed this I have never seen in 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.900
 world of tanks for those who do not understand I will explain 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.639
 the tank fell from a height exploded but the cause 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.580
 the death of the tank was not the very fall 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:44.450
 total loss 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.550
 the crew that is if very very much 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.560
 you can try to kill when falling 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.570
 team inside with the tank itself 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.430
 stay alive so it's time 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.830
 developers to introduce pillows into the game 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:58.090
 safety and parachutes for especially 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.090
 jumping tankers 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:02.239
 on this today's insane experience and 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:04.879
 coming to an end and before 

00:05:02.239 --> 00:05:07.069
 say goodbye i remind you that you can 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:09.979

 filming and a whole thousand if offer

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:15.379
 release don't forget to join our 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:17.329
