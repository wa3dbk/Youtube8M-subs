 when you are answered that you are always 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.440

 here always some companies in this whole 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:32.990
 time since carlos urbim another person 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:37.940
 accurate can only see if I continue 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:39.770
 playing right so I think this taste 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.760

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:46.220
 physical exercise that here in the 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.510
 people do some guidance on their 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:56.180
 walk efficiency rate is with 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:58.910
 how often during your consultation of the 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.440
 hypertension medical error in the first 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.570
 they often ask questions that 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:11.870
 lady had been in the previous consultation 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:14.860

 you think that during consultations 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.160
 to follow-up on the improvement in 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:27.620
 its pressure 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:29.870
 I think if you do not hit or miss more 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:34.040

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:36.440
