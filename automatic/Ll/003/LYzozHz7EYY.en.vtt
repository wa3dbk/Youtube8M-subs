00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:12.190
 As you see now, I'm doing fine, I do not have 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.910
 a card as good no great 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.870
 neither do we first get into 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.390
 Actions 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:23.990
 images you have to put it as is 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.470
 right there I do not have a full template 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.470
 why 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.590
 The size of the screen also influences 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.200
 in the performance I have his signs 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.350
 because if not not whole of some 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.350
 missions 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.920
 in quality also at minimum to 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.670
 maximum a little if it is not normal already in 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.670
 advanced 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:54.600
 everything very low everything all very low the 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.620
 very low quality of transforms this what 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.620
 would put in the description of 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.329
 in the video 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.940
 and good 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.940
 the top part the synchronization my 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.870
 face we have to have put 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.620
 because if it is not he again look 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.620
 in the speed 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:20.350
 we left the second copy 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:25.200
 good and first thing we have to 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:30.270
 do we go to home 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:36.560
 and in search we write the bar of the 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:43.579
 end of 5 on 7 and 5 and data 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:45.939
 and the king we are not going to give him to 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:48.979
 hydrate let's go one more back 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:52.850
 we center the place we are looking for 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.200
 there are two be in the folder now and here 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.600
 is 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:01.619
 we entered and in the last tab 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.450
 we give to open with and open with word 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.060
 park 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.819
 here we will see a series of codes there 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.790
 means the screen resolution and 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.700
 down here you have just copy what I 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.860
 I have in the graphic card each one 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.900
 will have his resolution 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.560
 as you see the minimum one will be higher 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.940
 it depends and you want to see it bigger 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.260
 smaller and this I'm going to copy 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.739
 also in the description of the world 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.470
 once completed we keep normal and already 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:36.860
 I had it saved not edited by the 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.549
 submissive the other way we're going team 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.959
 we go to system properties 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:45.280
 advanced system configuration voucher 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.280
 I'll return it again 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.300
 but it has all equipment 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.670
 properties of the system that is up 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.319
 left advanced configuration 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.080
 of the system we give the first one we give 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.950
 to adjust settings to get the 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.950
 better performance 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.069
 this mine we are going to have a lot of it for 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.879
 because it looks different relatives like the 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.910
 windows 97 then I use it when 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:16.430
 I'm going to play the country 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:19.489
 otherwise I take it off and this is 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:24.170
 all of you will see how the most rigid 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:28.330
 note the speed of the game 22 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.330
 subscribe to the light thanks
