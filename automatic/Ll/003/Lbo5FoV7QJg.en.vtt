00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
we're gonna see is the stage been

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.369 
we're gonna see is the stage been
dieting<00:00:41.280> for<00:00:41.610> about<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:42.149> little<00:00:42.989> shorter<00:00:43.260> this

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
dieting for about a little shorter this

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.290 
dieting for about a little shorter this
time<00:00:43.440> eight<00:00:43.800> weeks<00:00:44.040> heavy<00:00:44.789> weight<00:00:45.030> training

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
time eight weeks heavy weight training

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.660 
time eight weeks heavy weight training
kept<00:00:46.050> my<00:00:46.110> supplementation<00:00:46.950> up<00:00:47.100> they<00:00:47.370> kept<00:00:47.550> my

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
kept my supplementation up they kept my

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.270 
kept my supplementation up they kept my
food<00:00:47.940> at<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.239> constant<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.050> not<00:00:49.890> really<00:00:50.039> change

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
food at a constant and not really change

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.250 
food at a constant and not really change
too<00:00:50.550> much<00:00:50.579> even<00:00:51.270> from<00:00:51.480> over<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.870> past<00:00:52.079> four

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
too much even from over the past four

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.200 
too much even from over the past four
years<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:52.649> consistency<00:00:53.489> really<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.059> key

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
years so consistency really is the key

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.549 
years so consistency really is the key
when<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.390> comes<00:00:54.449> down<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.809> getting<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.260> lean

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
when it comes down to getting that lean

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.639 
when it comes down to getting that lean
defined<00:00:56.340> hard<00:00:56.969> physique<00:00:57.329> but<00:00:57.660> anyway<00:00:58.500> even

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
defined hard physique but anyway even
