important<00:00:02.429> one<00:00:02.460> is<00:00:02.760> the<00:00:03.110> application<00:00:04.110> did

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
important one is the application did

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.920 
important one is the application did
finish<00:00:04.770> launching<00:00:05.460> with<00:00:05.549> options<00:00:05.779> this<00:00:06.779> is

finish launching with options this is

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.480 
finish launching with options this is
the<00:00:07.020> one<00:00:07.259> that's<00:00:07.379> called<00:00:07.740> once<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.189> app<00:00:08.309> is

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
the one that's called once the app is

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.129 
the one that's called once the app is

more about views and V or hierarchies in

more about views and V or hierarchies in
more<00:00:58.020> things<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.289> can<00:00:58.410> do<00:00:58.500> with<00:00:58.590> views<00:00:58.890> we're

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
more things you can do with views we're

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.750 
more things you can do with views we're
going<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.640> get<00:00:59.730> into<00:00:59.989> actually<00:01:00.989> using<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.760> did

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
going to get into actually using the did

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.520 
going to get into actually using the did
finish<00:01:02.969> launching<00:01:03.449> we're<00:01:04.140> actually<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.470> be

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
finish launching we're actually to be

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.719 
finish launching we're actually to be
putting<00:01:04.769> some<00:01:04.890> code<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.220> here<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.489> you'll<00:01:05.610> get

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
putting some code in here and you'll get

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.789 
putting some code in here and you'll get
to<00:01:05.820> see<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.689> anything<00:01:07.140> we<00:01:07.229> put<00:01:07.530> in<00:01:07.619> here

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
to see that anything we put in here

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.359 
to see that anything we put in here
actually<00:01:08.010> happens<00:01:08.490> at<00:01:08.670> launch<00:01:09.890> so<00:01:10.890> that's<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
actually happens at launch so that's the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.890 
actually happens at launch so that's the
delegate<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.060> that's<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.600> interface

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
delegate and that's the interface

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.359 
delegate and that's the interface
builder<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.560> you're<00:01:13.770> specifying<00:01:14.010> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
builder so you're specifying the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.700 
builder so you're specifying the
delegate<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.119> your<00:01:15.360> it's<00:01:15.540> pointing<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.590> know

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
delegate and your it's pointing you know

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.370 
delegate and your it's pointing you know
to<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.979> class<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.759> but<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.720> know<00:01:18.780> highlight

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
to that class so but you know highlight

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.469 
to that class so but you know highlight
over<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.680> cocl<00:01:20.100> highlights<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:21.090> helical

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
over the cocl highlights the helical

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.450 
over the cocl highlights the helical
touch<00:01:21.750> app<00:01:21.990> delegate<00:01:22.409> object<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.430> that

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
touch app delegate object and that

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.390 
touch app delegate object and that
object<00:01:24.470> interface<00:01:25.470> builder<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> type

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
object interface builder is a type

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.850 
object interface builder is a type
public<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.479> touch<00:01:27.630> app<00:01:27.840> delegate<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.740> know

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
public of touch app delegate you know

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.319 
public of touch app delegate you know
this<00:01:29.009> if<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.369> go<00:01:29.460> into<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.759> inspector<00:01:30.210> up

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
this if you go into the inspector up

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.350 
this if you go into the inspector up
here<00:01:30.570> in<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:31.680> info<00:01:32.009> you'll<00:01:32.220> see<00:01:32.400> class<00:01:32.759> class

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
here in the info you'll see class class

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.390 
here in the info you'll see class class
identity<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:34.079> specifies<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.590> class<00:01:35.070> for

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
identity that specifies the class for

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.719 
identity that specifies the class for
this<00:01:35.520> object<00:01:35.790> interface<00:01:36.479> builder<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.740> it's

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
this object interface builder is a it's

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.160 
this object interface builder is a it's
called<00:01:38.909> hello<00:01:39.119> cocoa<00:01:39.420> touch<00:01:39.570> app<00:01:39.810> delegate

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
called hello cocoa touch app delegate

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.370 
called hello cocoa touch app delegate
and<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.619> class<00:01:40.799> for<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.159> right<00:01:41.880> here

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
and this is the class for it right here

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.380 
and this is the class for it right here
so<00:01:43.380> that's<00:01:43.500> how<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.740> all<00:01:43.829> ties<00:01:44.009> together

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
so that's how it all ties together

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.670 
so that's how it all ties together
that's<00:01:45.390> hog<00:01:45.570> it's<00:01:45.750> all<00:01:45.899> called<00:01:46.170> through<00:01:46.470> and

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
that's hog it's all called through and

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.550 
that's hog it's all called through and
that's<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.670> app<00:01:47.790> delegate<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:49.409> this

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
that's the app delegate and so this

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.260 
that's the app delegate and so this
that's<00:01:50.369> kind<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.759> conferencing<00:01:51.180> it

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
that's kind of the conferencing it

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.060 
that's kind of the conferencing it
you'll<00:01:51.420> see<00:01:51.570> delegates<00:01:51.990> once<00:01:52.170> again<00:01:52.439> as<00:01:52.560> a

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
you'll see delegates once again as a

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.410 
you'll see delegates once again as a
constant<00:01:53.490> design<00:01:53.729> pet<00:01:53.909> you're<00:01:54.060> going<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.240> see

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
constant design pet you're going to see

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.690 
constant design pet you're going to see
as<00:01:54.659> we<00:01:55.170> go<00:01:55.320> through<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.619> do<00:01:55.770> iOS<00:01:56.340> development

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
as we go through and do iOS development

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.010 
as we go through and do iOS development
you're<00:01:56.880> going<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.060> see<00:01:57.180> delegates<00:01:57.600> everywhere

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
you're going to see delegates everywhere

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.399 
you're going to see delegates everywhere
it's<00:01:58.920> very<00:01:59.100> important<00:01:59.549> so<00:01:59.880> once<00:02:00.600> again<00:02:00.750> that's

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
it's very important so once again that's

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.350 
it's very important so once again that's
the<00:02:01.770> first<00:02:02.040> tutorial<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.820> we<00:02:02.909> got<00:02:03.060> into

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
the first tutorial that we got into

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.020 
the first tutorial that we got into
making<00:02:03.600> our<00:02:03.689> first<00:02:03.899> appt<00:02:04.670> one<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.820> quick

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
making our first appt one of the quick

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.690 
making our first appt one of the quick
things<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.540> if<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:07.200> were<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.530> build<00:02:07.950> this<00:02:08.220> for

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
things is if you were to build this for

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.279 
things is if you were to build this for
you<00:02:09.179> can<00:02:09.330> actually<00:02:09.569> build<00:02:09.720> this<00:02:09.959> for<00:02:10.200> your

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
you can actually build this for your

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.650 
you can actually build this for your
device<00:02:10.530> very<00:02:11.099> simply<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:11.640> like<00:02:11.819> right<00:02:12.330> now<00:02:12.480> my

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
device very simply so like right now my

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.430 
device very simply so like right now my
phones<00:02:12.900> connected

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
phones connected

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.750 
phones connected
we<00:02:13.890> went<00:02:14.100> through<00:02:14.280> we<00:02:14.370> already<00:02:14.580> did<00:02:14.700> the

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
we went through we already did the

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.230 
we went through we already did the
profile<00:02:15.210> stuff<00:02:15.510> if<00:02:16.200> we<00:02:16.920> were<00:02:17.100> to<00:02:17.340> basically<00:02:17.940> go

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
profile stuff if we were to basically go

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.700 
profile stuff if we were to basically go
over<00:02:18.450> here<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:18.720> just<00:02:18.960> changes<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.320> device

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
over here and just changes the device

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.870 
over here and just changes the device
and<00:02:19.980> say<00:02:20.880> build<00:02:21.860> will<00:02:22.860> see<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.040> compile<00:02:23.490> for<00:02:23.820> the

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
and say build will see a compile for the

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.810 
and say build will see a compile for the
device<00:02:24.150> no<00:02:24.660> problem<00:02:25.140> build<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:25.830> run<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.250> then

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
device no problem build and run and then

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.820 
device no problem build and run and then
you<00:02:27.180> install<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.690> provisioning<00:02:28.140> profile<00:02:28.590> and

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
you install the provisioning profile and

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.680 
you install the provisioning profile and
it<00:02:29.220> goes<00:02:29.370> through<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:29.790> installs<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.360> actual

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
it goes through and installs the actual

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.440 
it goes through and installs the actual
app<00:02:30.810> on<00:02:30.990> your<00:02:31.140> device<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.410> runs<00:02:31.770> it<00:02:31.980> so<00:02:32.760> you

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
app on your device and runs it so you

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.700 
app on your device and runs it so you
can<00:02:33.600> actually<00:02:33.660> do<00:02:33.930> that<00:02:33.960> if<00:02:34.170> you'd<00:02:34.290> like<00:02:34.410> and

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
can actually do that if you'd like and

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.590 
can actually do that if you'd like and
you<00:02:34.770> can<00:02:34.920> see<00:02:35.070> this<00:02:35.250> app<00:02:35.520> or<00:02:35.700> on<00:02:35.820> on<00:02:36.450> your

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
you can see this app or on on your

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.910 
you can see this app or on on your
device<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:36.900> do<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.230> exact<00:02:37.470> same<00:02:37.500> thing<00:02:37.830> we

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
device and do the exact same thing we

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.940 
device and do the exact same thing we
just<00:02:37.950> saw<00:02:38.220> do<00:02:38.280> in<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:38.640> simulator<00:02:39.030> so<00:02:39.950> anyway

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
just saw do in the simulator so anyway

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.710 
just saw do in the simulator so anyway
next<00:02:41.550> tutorial<00:02:41.970> we'll<00:02:42.270> get<00:02:42.360> into<00:02:42.510> some<00:02:42.690> more

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
next tutorial we'll get into some more

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.960 
next tutorial we'll get into some more
fun<00:02:42.990> stuff<00:02:43.050> we'll<00:02:43.470> start<00:02:43.650> getting<00:02:43.680> into<00:02:44.070> views

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
fun stuff we'll start getting into views

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.460 
fun stuff we'll start getting into views
and<00:02:45.180> adding<00:02:45.420> more<00:02:45.540> views<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.110> to<00:02:46.380> the

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
and adding more views to the to the

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.610 
and adding more views to the to the
window<00:02:46.770> and<00:02:46.970> talk<00:02:47.970> about<00:02:48.120> those<00:02:48.420> so<00:02:49.110> see<00:02:49.530> you
