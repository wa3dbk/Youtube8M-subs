00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:06.690
 there is also a way to top off we 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.000
 we just put the stitches on the pins 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.280
 let go because you get this way 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.049
 a loose one 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.980
 Slightly more stretchable lace off the first 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.109
 stab 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.109
 officially knit but you leave the 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.400
 loop on the pin so you have one 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.400
 made a new lesson 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.289
 put your fingers through that new nose and 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.219
 take the working wire 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.219
 and you put it on 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.180
 just like with finger hooks 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.960
 the next loop goes this way to 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.260
 the next 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.180
 pim and then you go the next stitch too 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.329
 official again 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.219
 youth knit but then with the thread 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.809
 the loop 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.809
 so that loop that you pull through 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.149
 then you'd get the job you pull wire 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.149
 you through 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:19.420
 next stitch knit official straight 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.900
 put the plus 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.900
 sag 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:31.020
 grab district water and continue 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:53.810
 Go to the end of the wire again 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:56.420
 delete everything and we will continue 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.579
 all pins a sentence or all stitches 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.430
 are still pinning and you can 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:03.019
 pick up one by one now 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.120
 it does not matter with this method 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.139
 whether you live and work right or left 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.250
 both sides 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:09.250
 exactly the same 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.600
 You can see that it is quite broad 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.330
 when to cast off so it's on 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:42.250
 The top piece is broader than 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.250
 the rest of the light 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.410
 so it is more stretchable you could 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.410
 say 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:57.190
 and it also looks neat 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.190
 some holes underneath 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.680
 but which can then be used to 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:04.039
 possibly a fever or a wind 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.800
 thread through if necessary 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:07.910
 can imagine this way of 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.550
 cast off 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.889
 is nice for chamfering off a cabbage 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.280
 at the top so it is nice and spacious 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:15.280
 sit
