 educate tina the education site number 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:11.179
 one of Latin America in this video we're going 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.179
 to define what they are the genetic 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.740
 the genetics are libraries 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:27.869
 or collections of DNA fragments 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:32.669
 clones that contain partial or 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:35.330
 totally the genomic sequence of a 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.330
 individual 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:44.610
 there are different types of gene or teak 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:47.340
 according to the characteristics or provenance 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.130
 of the DNA in question we can 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.100
 classify them into three groups 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:55.800
 mainly 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.800
 it is called genomic library 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.090
 when all of the clones that the 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:06.380
 form 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:10.890
 contains all the DNA of the genome 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:16.350
 the entire genome of an individual 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:18.820
 complete would this include sequences 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.189
 coding and sequences not 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.689
 sequences encoding 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:29.820
 express and sequences that are not expressed 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.820
 we talk about chromosomal people k 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.320
 when the set of clones that the 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.380
 shapes 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.370
 contains a fraction of the genome that in 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.550
 this case will be a chromosome that is to say that 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:50.600
 the clones that form it will contain 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.360
 different fractions of a chromosome 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.450
 determined 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:02:01.330
 finally we talk about DNA genetics 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:04.300
 complementary when the set of 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.700
 clones that form it contains the 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:11.660
 sequence of the genes 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:14.390
 that are expressed in a certain tissue 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.250
 to understand more clearly this 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.770
 concept you can turn to others 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.470
 videos of the series in which they talk 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:26.060
 exclusively from the gene expression of 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:28.569
 how the expression of genes occurs 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.569
 in this case we talk about a fabric 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:35.810
 determined since genes can 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.819
 expressed in different ways in the 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.700
 cells of different tissues the 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.569
 expression has different systems of 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.569
 regulation 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:52.689
 this type of people here differs from this 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:55.329
 in the sense that when we talk about 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:58.810
 a genomic library is going to 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:03.629
 include sequences that are expressed is 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.629
 say genes regulatory sequences 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.829
 as well as sequences not 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.390
 encoding in the next videos 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:17.569
 We will see in detail the characteristics 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.569
 of each of this type of gene otecas 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.450
 to see the continuation of this topic 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.260
 educationally I recommend that you see the 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.260
 next video
