00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:10.270 
comparison there's the two bf 20s I have

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.110 
comparison there's the two bf 20s I have
this<00:00:10.690> one<00:00:10.990> just<00:00:11.650> kind<00:00:11.800> of<00:00:11.920> started<00:00:12.400> acting<00:00:13.000> up

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.120 
this one just kind of started acting up

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.360 
this one just kind of started acting up
and<00:00:13.240> giving<00:00:13.480> me<00:00:13.629> an<00:00:14.200> issue<00:00:14.440> with<00:00:14.799> this<00:00:15.010> motor

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.370 
and giving me an issue with this motor

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.980 
and giving me an issue with this motor
controller<00:00:16.830> basically<00:00:18.510> first<00:00:19.510> off<00:00:19.750> this

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 
controller basically first off this

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.040 
controller basically first off this
button<00:00:20.230> is<00:00:20.590> sketchy<00:00:21.220> and<00:00:22.090> I<00:00:22.689> wish<00:00:22.869> I<00:00:23.019> could

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
button is sketchy and I wish I could

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.730 
button is sketchy and I wish I could
replace<00:00:23.439> this<00:00:23.679> whole<00:00:24.310> pad<00:00:25.150> here<00:00:25.390> but<00:00:25.720> I<00:00:25.929> have

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
replace this whole pad here but I have

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.740 
replace this whole pad here but I have
power<00:00:26.949> on<00:00:27.189> to<00:00:27.429> it<00:00:27.550> and<00:00:27.849> sometimes<00:00:28.359> when<00:00:28.539> I<00:00:28.570> push

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
power on to it and sometimes when I push

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:29.999 
power on to it and sometimes when I push
the<00:00:28.900> button<00:00:28.929> I<00:00:29.320> could<00:00:29.589> actually<00:00:29.710> feel

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:30.009 
the button I could actually feel

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.159 
the button I could actually feel
underneath<00:00:30.460> there's<00:00:30.759> Orgel<00:00:31.089> rubber<00:00:31.269> coating

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
underneath there's Orgel rubber coating

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.110 
underneath there's Orgel rubber coating
under<00:00:32.349> here<00:00:32.529> that<00:00:32.770> it<00:00:32.950> kind<00:00:33.130> of<00:00:33.160> arcs<00:00:33.430> Sparks

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
under here that it kind of arcs Sparks

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.930 
under here that it kind of arcs Sparks
and<00:00:34.560> vibrates<00:00:35.560> and<00:00:35.950> it's<00:00:36.400> not<00:00:36.520> supposed<00:00:36.730> to<00:00:36.789> do

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
and vibrates and it's not supposed to do

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.299 
and vibrates and it's not supposed to do
that<00:00:36.969> but<00:00:37.120> maybe<00:00:37.570> you<00:00:37.629> can<00:00:37.780> hear<00:00:37.930> it<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:40.090> time

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
that but maybe you can hear it that time

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.090 
that but maybe you can hear it that time
right<00:00:42.309> there<00:00:42.550> that's<00:00:43.360> pretty<00:00:44.140> sketchy<00:00:44.410> I<00:00:44.739> know

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
right there that's pretty sketchy I know

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.590 
right there that's pretty sketchy I know
you<00:00:45.250> can<00:00:45.760> do<00:00:45.850> it<00:00:45.969> fast<00:00:46.210> enough

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
you can do it fast enough

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.229 
you can do it fast enough
it'll<00:00:47.320> be<00:00:47.379> fine<00:00:47.649> but<00:00:48.039> that's<00:00:48.340> fairly

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
it'll be fine but that's fairly

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.549 
it'll be fine but that's fairly
sketching<00:00:49.780> it<00:00:49.899> does<00:00:50.079> it<00:00:50.199> quite<00:00:50.379> often

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
sketching it does it quite often

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.250 
sketching it does it quite often
anyway<00:00:53.559> she<00:00:53.739> turned<00:00:53.980> on<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:55.149> spindle<00:00:55.899> does

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
anyway she turned on the spindle does

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.689 
anyway she turned on the spindle does
not<00:00:56.469> start<00:00:56.920> at<00:00:57.340> all<00:00:57.550> and<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.920> speed<00:01:00.519> knob

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
not start at all and the speed knob

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:02.520 
not start at all and the speed knob
doesn't<00:01:01.030> work<00:01:01.300> I'm<00:01:01.480> gonna<00:01:01.570> woman<00:01:02.230> forward

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
doesn't work I'm gonna woman forward

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.060 
doesn't work I'm gonna woman forward
right<00:01:02.710> now<00:01:02.890> I'm<00:01:03.039> in<00:01:03.160> low<00:01:03.690> but<00:01:04.690> the<00:01:05.410> thing<00:01:05.650> is<00:01:05.830> if

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
right now I'm in low but the thing is if

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.520 
right now I'm in low but the thing is if
I<00:01:06.160> get<00:01:06.220> past<00:01:06.700> this<00:01:07.510> right<00:01:07.810> now<00:01:07.930> is<00:01:08.080> technically

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
I get past this right now is technically

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.149 
I get past this right now is technically
full<00:01:08.830> speed<00:01:09.189> as<00:01:10.030> you<00:01:10.420> can<00:01:10.780> see<00:01:10.990> if<00:01:11.590> I<00:01:11.710> go<00:01:11.890> past

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
full speed as you can see if I go past

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:22.100 
full speed as you can see if I go past
though

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.850 

but<00:01:23.110> I<00:01:23.410> came<00:01:23.920> off<00:01:24.450> instantly<00:01:25.450> it's<00:01:25.570> off

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
but I came off instantly it's off

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.560 
but I came off instantly it's off
there's<00:01:26.860> no<00:01:27.040> actual<00:01:27.820> speed<00:01:28.180> control

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
there's no actual speed control

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.960 
there's no actual speed control
whatsoever<00:01:30.510> so<00:01:31.510> that's<00:01:32.260> that<00:01:32.560> one<00:01:32.860> and<00:01:33.220> this

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
whatsoever so that's that one and this

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.180 
whatsoever so that's that one and this
one<00:01:34.270> basically<00:01:34.990> just<00:01:35.530> to<00:01:35.650> show<00:01:35.830> you<00:01:35.920> how<00:01:36.040> it

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
one basically just to show you how it

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.150 
one basically just to show you how it
does<00:01:36.220> supposed<00:01:36.670> to<00:01:36.790> work<00:01:36.970> you<00:01:37.420> turn<00:01:37.600> it<00:01:37.750> on

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
does supposed to work you turn it on

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.290 
does supposed to work you turn it on
weird<00:01:39.160> and<00:01:39.310> forward<00:01:39.670> and<00:01:39.820> we're<00:01:39.940> in<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.150> low

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
weird and forward and we're in the low

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.120 
weird and forward and we're in the low
gear<00:01:41.670> turns<00:01:42.670> all<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:42.910> way<00:01:43.560> turns<00:01:44.560> on<00:01:44.740> strokes

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
gear turns all the way turns on strokes

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.900 
gear turns all the way turns on strokes
starts<00:01:45.580> doing<00:01:45.820> its<00:01:45.940> thing<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:47.740> I<00:01:48.130> don't<00:01:48.640> know

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
starts doing its thing so I don't know

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.410 
starts doing its thing so I don't know
if<00:01:49.060> it's<00:01:49.240> that's<00:01:49.770> just<00:01:50.770> a<00:01:50.890> knob<00:01:51.790> went<00:01:52.120> out<00:01:52.240> on

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
if it's that's just a knob went out on

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.380 
if it's that's just a knob went out on
this<00:01:52.570> one<00:01:53.190> or<00:01:54.190> what<00:01:54.369> exactly<00:01:54.490> is<00:01:55.000> going<00:01:55.180> on

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
this one or what exactly is going on

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.740 
this one or what exactly is going on
with<00:01:55.630> that<00:01:55.660> off<00:01:56.080> the<00:01:56.500> dig<00:01:57.460> into<00:01:57.700> that<00:01:58.000> and<00:01:58.270> it's

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
with that off the dig into that and it's

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.440 
with that off the dig into that and it's
one<00:01:58.810> more<00:01:59.080> thing<00:01:59.140> I<00:01:59.410> got<00:01:59.560> to<00:01:59.590> do<00:01:59.860> but<00:02:00.450> these

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
one more thing I got to do but these

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.080 
one more thing I got to do but these
panels<00:02:02.440> though<00:02:02.740> look<00:02:03.040> fairly<00:02:03.460> cheap<00:02:03.729> and<00:02:04.000> if

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
panels though look fairly cheap and if

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.969 
panels though look fairly cheap and if
the<00:02:04.270> electronics<00:02:04.810> inside<00:02:05.140> represents

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
the electronics inside represents

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.469 
the electronics inside represents
anything<00:02:06.369> with<00:02:06.550> this<00:02:06.750> panel<00:02:07.750> then<00:02:08.020> I<00:02:08.500> can<00:02:09.009> only

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
anything with this panel then I can only

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.780 
anything with this panel then I can only
only<00:02:10.479> a<00:02:10.600> match
