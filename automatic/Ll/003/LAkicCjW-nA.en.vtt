00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.840
 brand that is accompanying our 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.440
 delivery 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.480
 three business days have passed since 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:03:05.880

00:02:51.480 --> 00:03:29.280
 machine but this time he got the 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:30.030
 third business day of June schedule 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:39.299
 brasília 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:44.640
 we passed the result five points 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:48.900
 is comparative with respect to software 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.959
 almost the high end is very close to the 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.090
 high end game that I consider a 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:58.019
 configuration with two video cards and 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:02.340
 everything else and software of this all brings 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:07.080
 best video card processor 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:09.300
 reading the hd and give us a motion 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.140
 in which the tumor is working very 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.940
 good 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.040
 if you had any problems but with the 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.650
 components would probably give an error 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.690
 in a software that has already happened 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.280
 There we will if anything happens. 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.560
 test problem that we discover 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:26.639
 what is the defect and exchange company with 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:29.310
 defect so we're already makes a 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.500
 test battery and uses the 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:35.040
 computer also simulating a condition 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:37.410
 normal so that it comes at random to 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.940
 perfect condition is all 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.800
 drivers have at least one 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.840
 music lied 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.479
 if it happens to any problem right 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.070
 to know a defect a component suffices 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.979
 you get in touch with our postage 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.889
 and we'll do a test to detect the 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:54.780
 find the focus of effect and ask 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.419
 you send for exchange only the boy who 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:00.120
 I was defective, so now I'm 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:03.120
 folks are going to carry a garland off 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.919

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.080

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.700
 Sent 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.560

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.750

 But she 's here, she's going to travel there. 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:35.160
