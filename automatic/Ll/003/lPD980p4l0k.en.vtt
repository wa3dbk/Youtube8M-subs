rocks<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.840> redirect<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.410> flow<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.680> energy<00:00:47.390> so

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
rocks to redirect the flow of energy so

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.260 
rocks to redirect the flow of energy so
you've<00:00:48.570> got<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:49.160> live<00:00:50.160> plants<00:00:50.820> spill<00:00:51.149> out

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
you've got the live plants spill out

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.580 
you've got the live plants spill out
this<00:00:51.449> energy<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:51.989> you've<00:00:52.140> got<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.350> redirect
