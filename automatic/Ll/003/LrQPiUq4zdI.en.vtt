00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
in now this stacks that line properly

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:27.789 
in now this stacks that line properly
for<00:01:26.389> me<00:01:26.539> so<00:01:26.719> now<00:01:26.749> as<00:01:27.200> soon<00:01:27.349> as<00:01:27.439> I<00:01:27.560> start

that's the first thing to come out so it

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:33.699 
that's the first thing to come out so it
doesn't<00:01:31.249> tangle<00:01:31.520> up<00:01:31.759> on<00:01:31.909> those<00:01:32.060> guides<00:01:32.709> when

in<00:01:42.469> my<00:01:42.560> fingers<00:01:42.889> right<00:01:42.979> here<00:01:43.130> and<00:01:43.759> I<00:01:43.849> like<00:01:43.999> to

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
in my fingers right here and I like to

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:45.999 
in my fingers right here and I like to
have<00:01:44.299> about<00:01:44.599> a<00:01:44.659> rods<00:01:45.079> length<00:01:45.439> of<00:01:45.590> fly<00:01:45.799> line

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
have about a rods length of fly line

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.159 
have about a rods length of fly line
I'll<00:01:46.189> pass<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.789> tip<00:01:47.060> if<00:01:47.599> you<00:01:47.719> don't<00:01:47.899> have<00:01:48.020> any

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:48.169 
I'll pass the tip if you don't have any

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:49.749 
I'll pass the tip if you don't have any
fly<00:01:48.409> line<00:01:48.619> out<00:01:48.799> it's<00:01:49.009> very<00:01:49.159> difficult<00:01:49.520> to<00:01:49.639> make

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
fly line out it's very difficult to make

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.339 
fly line out it's very difficult to make
that<00:01:49.789> cast<00:01:50.239> right<00:01:50.539> away<00:01:50.779> you<00:01:50.989> have<00:01:51.079> to<00:01:51.169> make<00:01:51.319> a

00:01:51.339 --> 00:01:51.349 
that cast right away you have to make a

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:53.469 
that cast right away you have to make a
lot<00:01:51.619> of<00:01:51.649> false<00:01:52.009> casts<00:01:52.489> so<00:01:52.880> it's<00:01:53.029> nice<00:01:53.179> to<00:01:53.329> have

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
lot of false casts so it's nice to have

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.209 
lot of false casts so it's nice to have
a<00:01:53.509> little<00:01:53.749> bit<00:01:53.810> of<00:01:53.899> line<00:01:54.079> ready<00:01:54.409> when<00:01:55.189> that

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
a little bit of line ready when that

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:58.359 
a little bit of line ready when that
fish<00:01:55.579> shows<00:01:55.849> up<00:01:56.200> when<00:01:57.200> I<00:01:57.229> start<00:01:57.679> I'm<00:01:57.919> going<00:01:58.309> to

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
fish shows up when I start I'm going to

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.699 
fish shows up when I start I'm going to
bring<00:01:58.639> this<00:01:58.819> rod<00:01:59.119> back<00:01:59.450> and<00:02:00.020> as<00:02:00.139> I<00:02:00.289> bring<00:02:00.349> this

rod<00:02:00.889> back<00:02:01.099> I'm<00:02:01.309> still<00:02:01.549> holding<00:02:02.029> on<00:02:02.149> to<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.419> fly

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
rod back I'm still holding on to the fly

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.690 
rod back I'm still holding on to the fly
right<00:02:02.959> here<00:02:03.200> I'm<00:02:03.380> bringing<00:02:03.559> it<00:02:03.889> back<00:02:04.069> and<00:02:04.309> then

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
I like to bring my fly hand underneath

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.600 
I like to bring my fly hand underneath
my<00:02:07.759> rod<00:02:07.999> hand<00:02:08.500> then<00:02:09.500> when<00:02:09.769> I<00:02:09.799> flip<00:02:10.129> it<00:02:10.159> forward

I<00:02:10.969> can<00:02:11.000> let<00:02:11.870> go<00:02:11.900> of<00:02:12.049> the<00:02:12.200> fly<00:02:12.439> it<00:02:12.739> rolls<00:02:13.159> out<00:02:13.340> of

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
I can let go of the fly it rolls out of

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
you're ready to go I can grab that line

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.250 
you're ready to go I can grab that line
now<00:02:16.849> I'm<00:02:17.000> right<00:02:17.239> here<00:02:17.510> in<00:02:17.599> a<00:02:17.659> good<00:02:17.810> position<00:02:18.110> to

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
now I'm right here in a good position to

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.589 
now I'm right here in a good position to
start<00:02:18.349> making<00:02:18.859> that<00:02:19.010> cast<00:02:19.370> so<00:02:20.239> it<00:02:20.269> kind<00:02:20.540> of

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
start making that cast so it kind of

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.289 
start making that cast so it kind of
looks<00:02:20.810> like<00:02:20.900> this<00:02:21.579> holding<00:02:22.579> on<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:22.879> that<00:02:23.030> fly

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
looks like this holding on to that fly

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.770 
looks like this holding on to that fly
right<00:02:24.170> by<00:02:24.319> the<00:02:24.379> tail<00:02:24.739> I<00:02:24.980> come<00:02:25.519> back<00:02:25.730> roll<00:02:26.659> it

right by the tail I come back roll it
out

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
out

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.229 
out
catch<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.709> line<00:02:27.890> now<00:02:28.430> I<00:02:28.459> can<00:02:28.730> deliver<00:02:28.969> that

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
catch the line now I can deliver that

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.240 
catch the line now I can deliver that
fly<00:02:29.480> out<00:02:29.510> to<00:02:29.900> that<00:02:30.049> fish<00:02:30.379> or<00:02:30.799> I<00:02:30.859> could<00:02:31.010> start

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
fly out to that fish or I could start

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.009 
fly out to that fish or I could start
shooting<00:02:31.310> line<00:02:31.790> with<00:02:32.060> an<00:02:32.150> extra<00:02:32.450> false<00:02:32.689> cast

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
shooting line with an extra false cast

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.470 
shooting line with an extra false cast
this<00:02:33.680> is<00:02:33.859> one<00:02:34.069> thing<00:02:34.340> that's<00:02:34.849> really<00:02:35.299> going<00:02:35.390> to

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
this is one thing that's really going to

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.539 
this is one thing that's really going to
help<00:02:35.659> you<00:02:35.870> get<00:02:36.349> that<00:02:36.470> fly<00:02:36.709> to<00:02:36.769> that<00:02:37.069> target<00:02:37.519> a

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
help you get that fly to that target a

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.460 
help you get that fly to that target a
little<00:02:37.700> bit<00:02:37.879> sooner<00:02:38.239> it's<00:02:38.959> definitely<00:02:39.379> going

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
little bit sooner it's definitely going

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.190 
little bit sooner it's definitely going
to<00:02:39.530> help<00:02:39.680> you<00:02:39.769> catch<00:02:39.920> more<00:02:40.129> fish<00:02:40.659> so<00:02:41.659> hold<00:02:42.049> on

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
to help you catch more fish so hold on

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.800 
to help you catch more fish so hold on
to<00:02:42.349> that<00:02:42.470> fly<00:02:42.819> you<00:02:43.819> got<00:02:43.969> about<00:02:44.150> a<00:02:44.209> rods<00:02:44.510> length

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
to that fly you got about a rods length

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.179 
to that fly you got about a rods length
of<00:02:44.930> fly<00:02:45.139> line<00:02:45.379> or<00:02:45.590> a<00:02:45.620> little<00:02:45.859> bit<00:02:45.980> more

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:46.189 
of fly line or a little bit more

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:48.429 
of fly line or a little bit more
sometimes<00:02:46.790> you<00:02:47.120> can<00:02:47.359> hold<00:02:47.689> a<00:02:47.810> little<00:02:48.049> bit<00:02:48.200> more

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:48.439 
sometimes you can hold a little bit more

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:50.740 
sometimes you can hold a little bit more
and<00:02:48.769> if<00:02:49.579> you<00:02:49.670> want<00:02:49.970> to<00:02:50.060> hold<00:02:50.180> a<00:02:50.299> little<00:02:50.480> more

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
and if you want to hold a little more

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.659 
and if you want to hold a little more
than<00:02:50.930> a<00:02:50.989> rods<00:02:51.200> like<00:02:51.349> the<00:02:51.560> fly<00:02:51.739> line<00:02:51.950> now<00:02:52.069> I<00:02:52.280> like

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:52.669 
than a rods like the fly line now I like

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:54.220 
than a rods like the fly line now I like
to<00:02:52.700> grab<00:02:52.970> right<00:02:53.299> at<00:02:53.419> the<00:02:53.510> very<00:02:53.659> end<00:02:53.870> of<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.019> fly

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
to grab right at the very end of the fly

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.720 
to grab right at the very end of the fly
line<00:02:54.470> I<00:02:54.620> usually<00:02:54.980> put<00:02:55.159> it<00:02:55.189> underneath<00:02:55.489> my

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
line I usually put it underneath my

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.059 
line I usually put it underneath my
middle<00:02:56.030> finger<00:02:56.389> holding<00:02:56.659> that<00:02:56.840> rod<00:02:57.079> as<00:02:57.829> soon

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
middle finger holding that rod as soon

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:59.890 
middle finger holding that rod as soon
as<00:02:58.189> the<00:02:58.280> fish<00:02:58.459> shows<00:02:58.669> up<00:02:58.879> I'll<00:02:59.060> drop<00:02:59.389> that<00:02:59.599> part

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
as the fish shows up I'll drop that part

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.800 
as the fish shows up I'll drop that part
of<00:02:59.989> the<00:03:00.049> line<00:03:00.230> still<00:03:00.590> holding<00:03:00.919> onto<00:03:01.069> that<00:03:01.250> fly

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
of the line still holding onto that fly

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.170 
of the line still holding onto that fly
bring<00:03:02.810> it<00:03:02.930> back<00:03:03.169> let<00:03:03.859> it<00:03:03.980> go<00:03:04.159> catch<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:04.970> line

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
bring it back let it go catch the line

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.659 
bring it back let it go catch the line
now<00:03:05.840> I<00:03:05.870> can<00:03:06.290> deliver<00:03:06.620> that<00:03:06.889> fly<00:03:07.159> out<00:03:07.189> to<00:03:07.549> those

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:07.669 
now I can deliver that fly out to those

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:09.849 
now I can deliver that fly out to those
fish<00:03:08.060> and<00:03:08.329> then<00:03:08.840> I<00:03:08.959> can<00:03:09.139> start<00:03:09.349> fishing<00:03:09.590> that

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:09.859 
fish and then I can start fishing that

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:12.369 
fish and then I can start fishing that
fly<00:03:10.209> so<00:03:11.209> this<00:03:11.359> is<00:03:11.480> a<00:03:11.510> couple<00:03:11.720> ways<00:03:11.959> you<00:03:12.019> can<00:03:12.260> get
