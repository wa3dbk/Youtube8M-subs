see how adding just that bit of gray all
the<00:04:23.940> way<00:04:24.000> around<00:04:24.150> it<00:04:24.570> really<00:04:25.050> made<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:25.440> pot

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
the way around it really made the pot

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:33.350 
the way around it really made the pot
look<00:04:26.220> whiter<00:04:28.310> my<00:04:29.310> next<00:04:29.760> step<00:04:31.220> is<00:04:32.240> that<00:04:33.240> I'm

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
look whiter my next step is that I'm

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.060
