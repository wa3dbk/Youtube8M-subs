00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.559
 Performance less energy consumption 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.260
 and among other very important things that 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:50.410

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.850
 as you can see and in the back 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.010
 they come a little up letters and 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.379

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.800
 that has a dvd a dvd and hdmi and 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:02.710
 displayport this same let's open it 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.140
 very fast before we open it 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.729
 let's talk this card was a 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.680

 who did you have to do it if not then in 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.710
 line is to know a link to go to 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.550
 visit them because if they want some 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.970
 component 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.010
 pc peripherals alone and anything 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.650
 they can help us with that and 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.020
 advise them in the best way so that 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.390
 they can put together their pc leads in the co 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.130
 for just leave that and this one the truth 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.960
 who have very very good attention to 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.880
 client and all that more than giving 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.350
 it is noteworthy that advises them much 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.420
 your clients and help them a lot to 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.920
 have a very good experience of 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.690
 buy and buy just what 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.230
 They need and will buy more or 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:48.010
 less and good here we have what it is 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:51.310
 important information 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:54.640
 we do not care this on this side we have 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.090
 a little about the installation ones 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.659
 stickers 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.340
 down here we have what are the cables 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.610
 of great connected in this source of 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.230
 power 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.240
 and as I was telling you something that fits 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.570
 highlight is that it 's much less 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.610
 energy than its predecessors and here 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.680
 we have a converter I think it is 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:21.489
 from displayport 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:24.500
 It should be 20 is not if he saw that 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.670
 we also have a badge to be able to 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.530
 have our cabinet 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.330
 and we have the guide to use this card 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.030
 and well let's open it up there's no 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.370
 a lot like to show in this case a 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.980
 ordinary video card but 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.550
 Can you tell me how beautiful they look? 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.550
 Of cards 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.950
 you have to be very careful when you grab it 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:53.130
 above the static and good 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:55.850
 gentlemen here we have it 7 x 9 70 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.850
 do not make this one 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.430
 and well, now we are with life 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.740
 of the installation and they will check how the 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.990
 we are going to install and everything so that they can 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.270
 see all that and ready to use it a while longer 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:09.450
 well we 're back to the video now we're going 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:12.810
 to the installation this and we're going to remove 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.330
 is that these people that I have is a 760 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:19.250
 which is a very good card but 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.250
 the truth is that the one that I'm going to install 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.310
 Be careful if you lose the screws 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:29.610
 I think it was not above the one that was not 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.190
 sorry for the truth how dirty my 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.670
 cabinet but good not time yesterday the 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.540
 cleaning what he was telling us 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:45.519
 Let's remove 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:50.400
 the current and this nothing else comes out very 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:53.060
 quickly if that one had something dirty 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.060
 is 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.400
 is the one that we are going to install gentlemen 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.970
 then section in your city but it's 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.160
 what do I do 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.220
 we are going to 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:11.410
 do the installation that is very simple 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:14.090
 only if we put pressure because 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.830
 let's fix the jolla if they want to see 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.970
 what is it that they have started I think that 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.459
 I have some videos made in the 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:23.019
 channel in which you can check 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.019
 everything that my pc has 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:31.330
 there it is and only what we are going to 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:35.939
 to do is connect 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:40.919
 the current and urges the truth is that 

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:40.919
 very very fast let's put the other 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.310
 has been building the installation of 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.460
 video card again many 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.690
 thanks to the people of high software 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.090
 moving this card has two 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.560
 options 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.030
 and then if they want some proof of 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.500
 performance or something like that with pleasure 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.510
 nothing but tell me what games they want 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.270
 to try it out and upload the proof of 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.639
 performance of my pc good positive ni 7 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.070
 40 70 every state see blocked has 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:10.210
 liquid element has 16 gigas of ram 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:14.260

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.479
 motherboard I think I'm still 

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:23.590
 and what I have thus isolated the source of 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:27.830
 be able to provide if we buy in rational 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:29.389
