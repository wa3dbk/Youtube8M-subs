bumped into the Americas of course as we

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.270 
bumped into the Americas of course as we
know<00:00:56.550> Columbus<00:00:57.239> was<00:00:57.510> sailing<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:59.250> the

the<00:01:07.500> rest<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:07.890> history<00:01:08.280> now<00:01:09.060> what<00:01:09.210> was<00:01:09.360> very

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
the rest is history now what was very

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.840 
the rest is history now what was very
interesting<00:01:10.020> about<00:01:10.080> chili<00:01:10.530> plants<00:01:11.040> was<00:01:11.460> that

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
interesting about chili plants was that

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.810 
interesting about chili plants was that
first<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.270> all<00:01:12.360> they<00:01:12.570> were<00:01:12.630> very<00:01:12.750> easy<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.409> grow

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
first of all they were very easy to grow

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.370 
first of all they were very easy to grow
the<00:01:14.820> other<00:01:14.970> thing<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.689> chili<00:01:15.930> plants

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
the other thing is that chili plants

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.770 
the other thing is that chili plants
hybridized<00:01:17.009> very<00:01:17.400> readily<00:01:17.759> depending<00:01:18.689> upon

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
hybridized very readily depending upon

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.300 
hybridized very readily depending upon
the<00:01:19.080> different<00:01:19.439> soil<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.950> climatic

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
the different soil and climatic

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.950 
the different soil and climatic
conditions<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.119> they're<00:01:21.270> growing<00:01:21.509> under

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
conditions that they're growing under

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.740 
conditions that they're growing under
and<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.640> chilies<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.030> were<00:01:24.270> taken<00:01:24.630> to

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
and so the chilies that were taken to

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.320 
and so the chilies that were taken to
Northern<00:01:25.110> Europe<00:01:25.310> tended<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.490> develop<00:01:26.880> larger

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
Northern Europe tended to develop larger

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.840 
Northern Europe tended to develop larger
pods<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.950> active<00:01:29.280> ingredient<00:01:29.820> that

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
pods and the active ingredient that

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.090 
pods and the active ingredient that
gives<00:01:30.150> Chile<00:01:30.450> its<00:01:30.689> heat<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.290> substance<00:01:31.920> called

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
gives Chile its heat a substance called

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.179 
gives Chile its heat a substance called
capsaicin<00:01:32.869> tended<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.990> occur<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.619> lower

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
capsaicin tended to occur in lower

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.640 
capsaicin tended to occur in lower
quantities<00:01:35.909> in<00:01:36.240> these<00:01:36.780> ones<00:01:37.079> growing<00:01:37.409> in

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
quantities in these ones growing in

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.760 
quantities in these ones growing in
northern<00:01:38.009> Europe<00:01:38.570> so<00:01:39.570> much<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
northern Europe so much so that the

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.590 
northern Europe so much so that the
people<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.130> those<00:01:41.310> areas<00:01:41.759> liked<00:01:42.210> the

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
people in those areas liked the

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.889 
people in those areas liked the
beautiful<00:01:42.990> sweet<00:01:43.350> flavor<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.880> now<00:01:45.600> what

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
beautiful sweet flavor of the now what

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.380 
beautiful sweet flavor of the now what
are<00:01:45.990> referred<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.320> as<00:01:46.619> paprika<00:01:47.220> pods<00:01:47.610> directly

what has given us the sweet paprika of

what has given us the sweet paprika of
northern<00:01:55.860> Europe<00:01:56.219> you'll<00:01:57.090> also<00:01:57.360> find<00:01:57.600> paprika

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
northern Europe you'll also find paprika

northern Europe you'll also find paprika
in<00:01:58.469> Spain<00:01:58.890> but<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.790> has<00:01:59.939> a<00:01:59.969> slightly<00:02:00.329> different

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
in Spain but it has a slightly different

in Spain but it has a slightly different
flavor<00:02:00.960> profile<00:02:01.799> for<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.490> one<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:03.000> very

because during this approximate 2-week
period<00:03:12.430> what<00:03:13.430> happens<00:03:13.819> is<00:03:14.000> that<00:03:14.150> the<00:03:14.269> paprika

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
period what happens is that the paprika

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.080 
period what happens is that the paprika
pod<00:03:14.959> loses<00:03:15.379> a<00:03:15.409> little<00:03:15.620> bit<00:03:15.739> of<00:03:15.829> moisture<00:03:16.090> but

also the caps Anthon content now this is

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.890 
also the caps Anthon content now this is
what<00:03:21.019> gives<00:03:21.530> paprika<00:03:21.949> its<00:03:22.250> color<00:03:22.660> the<00:03:23.660> caps

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
what gives paprika its color the caps

what gives paprika its color the caps
Anthon<00:03:24.410> content<00:03:25.040> actually<00:03:25.359> increases<00:03:26.739> then

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
Anthon content actually increases then

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.939 
Anthon content actually increases then
after<00:03:28.639> this<00:03:28.790> period<00:03:29.120> the<00:03:29.750> paprika<00:03:30.139> pods<00:03:30.590> are

after this period the paprika pods are

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:34.809 
after this period the paprika pods are
washed<00:03:31.449> they<00:03:32.449> chopped<00:03:32.930> up<00:03:33.169> usually<00:03:33.949> in<00:03:34.190> some

fairly<00:03:37.069> finely<00:03:37.510> they<00:03:38.510> then<00:03:39.139> go<00:03:39.440> through<00:03:40.099> a

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:40.129 
fairly finely they then go through a

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:43.089 
fairly finely they then go through a
dehydration<00:03:41.060> process<00:03:41.590> where<00:03:42.590> they<00:03:42.949> are

dehydration process where they are

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:45.610 
dehydration process where they are
gradually<00:03:43.669> dried<00:03:44.150> out<00:03:44.419> and<00:03:44.750> then<00:03:45.440> when

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
gradually dried out and then when

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.129 
gradually dried out and then when
they're<00:03:45.829> dry<00:03:46.129> they're<00:03:46.459> saved<00:03:47.209> to<00:03:47.599> remove<00:03:47.959> the

pieces of stem and stalk that would

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.309 
pieces of stem and stalk that would
still<00:03:50.900> be<00:03:51.109> remaining<00:03:51.560> and<00:03:51.940> then<00:03:52.940> the<00:03:53.540> pods<00:03:53.900> and

still be remaining and then the pods and
the<00:03:54.560> seeds<00:03:54.829> that<00:03:54.949> were<00:03:55.129> in<00:03:55.280> the<00:03:55.400> pods<00:03:55.669> are

the seeds that were in the pods are
ground<00:03:56.959> to<00:03:57.560> a<00:03:57.590> beautiful<00:03:58.129> fine<00:03:58.459> red<00:03:58.879> powder

this<00:04:00.409> grinding<00:04:00.980> process<00:04:01.190> is<00:04:01.609> actually<00:04:01.730> quite

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
this grinding process is actually quite

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:03.909 
this grinding process is actually quite
complex<00:04:02.690> because<00:04:03.169> it<00:04:03.230> has<00:04:03.470> to<00:04:03.620> be<00:04:03.709> done<00:04:03.889> very

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:03.919 
complex because it has to be done very

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:06.369 
complex because it has to be done very
carefully<00:04:04.220> and<00:04:04.970> it<00:04:05.449> has<00:04:05.599> to<00:04:05.720> be<00:04:05.840> done<00:04:05.989> in<00:04:06.139> such

carefully and it has to be done in such
a<00:04:06.409> way<00:04:06.709> that<00:04:06.949> it<00:04:07.040> actually<00:04:07.190> enhances<00:04:07.849> the

a way that it actually enhances the
flavor<00:04:08.629> rather<00:04:09.319> than<00:04:09.620> taking<00:04:09.979> away<00:04:10.220> from<00:04:10.280> it

rollers<00:04:25.880> and<00:04:26.240> that's<00:04:26.449> what<00:04:26.630> crushes<00:04:27.110> it<00:04:27.229> up

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
rollers and that's what crushes it up

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.090 
rollers and that's what crushes it up
and<00:04:28.600> with<00:04:29.600> this<00:04:29.840> milling<00:04:30.350> it<00:04:30.770> actually

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
and with this milling it actually

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.730 
and with this milling it actually
happens<00:04:31.490> about<00:04:31.759> six<00:04:32.120> times<00:04:32.650> before<00:04:33.650> the

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
happens about six times before the

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.950 
happens about six times before the
factor<00:04:34.100> is<00:04:34.220> finely<00:04:34.669> ground<00:04:34.910> so<00:04:35.539> the<00:04:35.660> profit

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
factor is finely ground so the profit

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.749 
factor is finely ground so the profit
will<00:04:36.110> go<00:04:36.259> through<00:04:36.560> one<00:04:36.740> mill<00:04:36.979> and<00:04:37.280> then<00:04:37.669> it

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:37.759 
will go through one mill and then it

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:39.490 
will go through one mill and then it
will<00:04:37.850> go<00:04:37.970> through<00:04:38.150> the<00:04:38.240> next<00:04:38.449> mill<00:04:38.810> and<00:04:39.139> then

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
will go through the next mill and then

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.350 
will go through the next mill and then
will<00:04:39.620> go<00:04:39.740> through<00:04:39.949> the<00:04:40.070> next<00:04:40.220> mill<00:04:40.550> and<00:04:41.120> this

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
will go through the next mill and this

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.930 
will go through the next mill and this
goes<00:04:41.660> through<00:04:41.690> six<00:04:42.470> different<00:04:42.650> mills<00:04:43.039> and<00:04:43.400> at

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
goes through six different mills and at

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.879 
goes through six different mills and at
the<00:04:44.060> end<00:04:44.270> of<00:04:44.449> the<00:04:44.570> milling<00:04:44.840> process<00:04:44.870> you<00:04:45.740> have

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
the end of the milling process you have

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:48.400 
the end of the milling process you have
a<00:04:45.919> power<00:04:46.220> that<00:04:46.400> is<00:04:46.610> beautifully<00:04:47.120> fine<00:04:47.479> very
