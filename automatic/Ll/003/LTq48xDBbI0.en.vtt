00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.219 
beret in the second fret and the ring
finger<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.670> fourth<00:01:27.150> fret<00:01:27.510> of<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.780> a

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
finger is on the fourth fret of the a

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.050 
finger is on the fourth fret of the a
and<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.740> pinky<00:01:29.100> on<00:01:29.160> the<00:01:29.250> fourth<00:01:29.610> fret<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:30.030> the

and the pinky on the fourth fret of the
D<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.920> then<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.040> would<00:01:32.100> come<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.670> right<00:01:32.880> hand

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
D so then I would come to the right hand

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.410 
D so then I would come to the right hand
which<00:01:33.300> is<00:01:33.450> always<00:01:33.660> as<00:01:34.590> usual<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:36.000> biggest

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
which is always as usual the biggest

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.330 
which is always as usual the biggest
problem<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.770> play<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.810> normal<00:01:40.009> beat<00:01:41.009> with<00:01:41.310> a

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
problem and I play a normal beat with a

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.070 
problem and I play a normal beat with a
slap<00:01:41.880> on<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.390> two<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.110> four<00:01:43.440> I<00:01:44.869> played<00:01:45.869> like

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
slap on the two and four I played like

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.230 
slap on the two and four I played like
this<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:47.119> put<00:01:48.119> my<00:01:48.270> fingers<00:01:49.130> well<00:01:50.130> like<00:01:50.340> as<00:01:50.610> if<00:01:50.880> I

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
this I put my fingers well like as if I

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.279 
this I put my fingers well like as if I
would<00:01:51.750> use<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.020> plectrum<00:01:52.759> this<00:01:53.759> well<00:01:54.660> is<00:01:55.020> the

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
would use a plectrum this well is the

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:56.630 
would use a plectrum this well is the
black<00:01:55.500> from<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.890> middle<00:01:56.160> of<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.610> the

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
black from the middle of the the

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.630 
black from the middle of the the
forefinger<00:01:57.330> and<00:01:57.479> then<00:01:57.690> I<00:01:57.899> put<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.500> thumb<00:01:59.250> here

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
forefinger and then I put a thumb here

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.469 
forefinger and then I put a thumb here
my<00:02:00.710> middle<00:02:01.710> finger<00:02:02.009> on<00:02:02.160> top<00:02:02.550> of<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.360> this

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:29.009 

well<00:03:25.599> if<00:03:25.930> this<00:03:26.260> is<00:03:26.470> not<00:03:26.739> the<00:03:26.919> key<00:03:27.129> for<00:03:27.370> you<00:03:28.019> then

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
well if this is not the key for you then

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.240 
well if this is not the key for you then
maybe<00:03:29.950> I<00:03:30.069> don't<00:03:30.159> know<00:03:30.459> if<00:03:30.609> you<00:03:31.230> know<00:03:32.230> about<00:03:32.560> the

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
maybe I don't know if you know about the

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.360 
maybe I don't know if you know about the
basic<00:03:33.819> corpse<00:03:34.419> in<00:03:34.629> every<00:03:35.319> key<00:03:35.680> that<00:03:35.979> we<00:03:36.159> have

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
basic corpse in every key that we have

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.610 
basic corpse in every key that we have
here<00:03:36.669> for<00:03:36.849> example<00:03:36.909> if<00:03:37.329> you<00:03:37.449> play<00:03:37.659> Nancy<00:03:38.169> I

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
here for example if you play Nancy I

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.020 
here for example if you play Nancy I
wanna<00:03:39.459> wish<00:03:39.819> you<00:03:39.849> a<00:03:40.269> Merry<00:03:40.780> Christmas<00:03:41.400> I<00:03:42.400> think

a<00:03:47.739> Merry<00:03:48.280> Christmas

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.450 

Merry<00:03:51.950> Christmas<00:03:53.380> here<00:03:54.380> it<00:03:54.530> is<00:03:54.710> the<00:03:54.920> a<00:03:55.100> minor

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
Merry Christmas here it is the a minor

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.190 
Merry Christmas here it is the a minor
that<00:03:56.210> is<00:03:56.630> the<00:03:56.960> parallel<00:03:57.350> of<00:03:57.740> the<00:03:58.900> what<00:03:59.900> do<00:04:00.050> we

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
that is the parallel of the what do we

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.830 
that is the parallel of the what do we
call<00:04:00.590> it<00:04:01.420> the<00:04:02.420> minor<00:04:03.280> power<00:04:04.280> what<00:04:05.270> is<00:04:05.300> it

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
call it the minor power what is it

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.890 
call it the minor power what is it
the<00:04:06.260> major<00:04:06.530> parallel<00:04:07.220> it's<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:07.670> sixth<00:04:08.180> step

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
the major parallel it's the sixth step

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.190 
the major parallel it's the sixth step
so<00:04:09.740> when<00:04:10.370> you<00:04:10.520> go<00:04:10.700> for<00:04:10.940> example<00:04:11.360> you<00:04:11.570> see<00:04:11.959> with

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
so when you go for example you see with

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:19.180 
so when you go for example you see with
C<00:04:12.980> major<00:04:13.400> D<00:04:13.700> major<00:04:15.340> minor<00:04:16.340> F<00:04:17.060> major<00:04:17.120> G<00:04:17.930> major<00:04:18.290> a

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
C major D major minor F major G major a

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.770 
C major D major minor F major G major a
minor<00:04:19.730> here<00:04:20.329> it<00:04:20.450> is<00:04:20.799> is<00:04:21.799> the<00:04:22.100> sixth<00:04:22.670> step<00:04:23.120> if

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
minor here it is is the sixth step if

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.320 
minor here it is is the sixth step if
you<00:04:24.200> play<00:04:24.860> the<00:04:25.450> scale<00:04:26.450> in<00:04:27.340> if<00:04:28.340> you<00:04:28.550> play<00:04:28.820> it<00:04:28.880> in

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
you play the scale in if you play it in

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.580 
you play the scale in if you play it in
course<00:04:29.900> young<00:04:30.350> and<00:04:30.740> then<00:04:31.780> on<00:04:32.780> the<00:04:33.110> seventh

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
course young and then on the seventh

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:42.550 
course young and then on the seventh
fret<00:04:33.770> we<00:04:34.370> have<00:04:36.640> a<00:04:38.440> -<00:04:39.440> the<00:04:39.680> six<00:04:41.050> step<00:04:42.050> here<00:04:42.350> as<00:04:42.410> I

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
fret we have a - the six step here as I

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.490 
fret we have a - the six step here as I
said<00:04:42.830> if<00:04:43.340> you're<00:04:43.669> in<00:04:43.820> G<00:04:44.120> let's<00:04:44.419> try<00:04:45.200> to<00:04:45.260> find

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
said if you're in G let's try to find

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:56.609 
said if you're in G let's try to find
out<00:04:45.710> what's<00:04:46.490> we<00:04:46.640> playing<00:04:46.910> chief

00:04:56.609 --> 00:04:56.619 

00:04:56.619 --> 00:05:01.809 

so<00:04:57.619> here<00:04:57.799> we<00:04:57.919> have<00:04:58.039> major<00:04:58.879> C<00:04:59.749> and<00:05:00.169> D<00:05:00.529> and<00:05:01.039> the

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:01.819 
so here we have major C and D and the

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:03.969 
so here we have major C and D and the
parallel<00:05:02.419> parallel<00:05:02.929> that<00:05:03.409> I<00:05:03.439> was<00:05:03.619> talking

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
parallel parallel that I was talking

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:09.489 
parallel parallel that I was talking

and that's in a way well that's a reason

00:06:26.269 --> 00:06:29.679 
and that's in a way well that's a reason
why<00:06:26.559> the<00:06:27.559> keys<00:06:28.129> are<00:06:28.459> for<00:06:28.849> the<00:06:29.059> different<00:06:29.449> keys

00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:29.689
