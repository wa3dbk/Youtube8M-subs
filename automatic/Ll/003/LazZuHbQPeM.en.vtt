00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:40.750
 Hello children 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.670
 I am the Sacha and I will be you 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.030
 explain today how to get the legend of 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.219
 zelda majora's mask with the same charcoal 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.309
 Textures package can let play 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:54.339
 function I do because 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.829
 it needs to ensure in principle all 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:01:01.420
 simply you need one first 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:03.460
 PC of the pc stands with most under 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.560
 but most of all, he has the table most of the time 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.970
 The on the table that does not matter 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.619
 Electricity supplier, of course, also nice if 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.460
 the eyes pc still to the mains 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.890
 could connect internet 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.060
 Of course, also of advantage 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.920
 otherwise yes my videos could not 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.299
 groups are the next steps 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.000
 actually quite simple 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.350
 I'll be slow with you 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.330
 go through together 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:36.520
 so that everyone has understood as well 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:41.109
 each of my videos at awtowas mask and 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:45.270
 freaks also had the 5 downloadlink 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:45.270
 for this fifth part here 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.299
 I ask what is this is the patch 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:56.490
 files that are all crammed with 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:58.740
 pmg with image files the old files in 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.220
 game itself will be replaced 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.299
 later but no longer have to do that 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.819
 all sit 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.450
 we have a clever computer of 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:10.800
 can do that for us what are you doing now 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.920
 with the five districts the 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.890
 always ask questions you need 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.840
 either winrar or 7 zip there i would 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.030
 However, you are recommended to collect 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.900
 because winrar does not have with me 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.090
 works if it was not me either 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.099
 works then it is probably at the grave 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.220
 so get it right now 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.660
 seven tenths the link to it is 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.670
 Of course not in the description 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.450
 you can google it with google 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.090
 go search and if you like that very much 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:46.860
 Popular success is relatively easy 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:50.160
 He marks the whole school doing one 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:53.639
 right click on and there you already see 7 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.860
 zip file unpack here in pack after 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:58.690
 archive check blablabla 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.910
 we do not grab everything because we do 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.510
 want him compressed on the lid 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:07.690
 to have 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:09.910
 That's why I'm doing yes and who expects 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.970
 now all the data through and impact 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.390
 all compact in a locate on the 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.390
 desktop 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.519
 not difficult or and yet 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:25.630
 Believe me when I say it will 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:29.460
 simple but not difficult 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.460
 that is relatively simple 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.599
 if you have the funny loading bars 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.730
 she keeps track of you that always fuller 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:39.400
 becomes and left to right 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:43.720
 is increasingly green that is because 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.879
 that the pc lives through all the data and 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.459
 when he has arrived at the end we have 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:51.660
 a beautiful continuous green 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.660
 stripes on the screen 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:59.650
 that makes me happy 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:03.790
 Of course that pleases me too follows here 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:06.239
 that it takes a relatively long time for me 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.239
 screen 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.780
 But the anticipation of that is natural 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:17.959
 That's why you can do it for a long time 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:21.919
 wait also deal with a few 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:24.410
 videos of me when he finished this 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:26.750
 We've been pulling now 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:30.610
 over into the reception area one 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:33.310
 nice new compact folder 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.900
 his name is so 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:42.500
 I can not pronounce that 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:44.990
 believe that means if you archive the z 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.860
 Let's open it here already 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:51.820
 that we have a nice place and a trainer 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:55.070
 64 means we click on 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:57.169
 Here we have a lot of files with 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.759
 whom we can not do anything because 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:01.580
 We all have no idea of ​​the matter 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:06.680
 have the important thing is this is 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:09.160
 folder young project 64 open what 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:12.649
 Of course you also needed 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:15.659
 legend of zelda majora's mask rom 

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:18.210
 not included in this folder 

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:21.740
 you have to go somewhere external to one 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:24.300
 download another website 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.639
 no matter and of course have this in the 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:31.050
 files never viruses again from yours 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:33.539
 Bill under gets this while you 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.809
 you're running illegal files here 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:39.389
 on auctions on settings 

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:41.729
 usually if you open this and 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:47.089
 They plugin time since their normal 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:50.219
 I believe on davos direct3d 816 on it 

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:53.069
 since we but that the textures package 

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:55.319
 we want to take this one here with me 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:56.039
 was already selected because I'm so 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:06:03.539
 take up 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:06.089
 Guild 64 final day 28 2012 is so long 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:09.139
 it already exists and we have him 

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:12.839
 Found today or a few weeks ago 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:14.160
 and audio plugin controller plugin can 

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:17.460
 to leave her, of course 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:21.420
 the whole confirmed simply with click 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:23.400
 ok cdu already 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.650
 We now have the folder and the 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.660
 everything is set, what do we have to do 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.580
 do it now 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.390
 that's easy, just solve that 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:36.450
 start Game 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:39.360
 that is waiting for me here while he is 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:40.710
 the textures package loads and all 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.580
 replaced data 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:48.960
 that was a total of 500 mb image files 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:50.910
 Unfortunately, much or more of this is 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.540
 not to say side because that was it 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.090
 beautiful 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:56.220
 No longer did you need to do more 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:07:00.330
 now the legend of zelda majora's mask 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:03.690
 in the same hd textures packages and me 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:05.220

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:11.840
 You can also give me one or leave that 

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:13.980
 Of course, it would be very friendly of me 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.200

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:18.680
 I am always there for you you can 

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:21.480

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.700

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:29.510
 Sleep well again
