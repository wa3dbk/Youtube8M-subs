the sport he's left them in awe yeah

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.840 
the sport he's left them in awe yeah
it's<00:02:54.780> even<00:02:54.990> quiet<00:02:55.440> when<00:02:55.740> he<00:02:55.950> wins<00:02:56.220> a<00:02:56.370> race<00:02:56.550> and

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
it's even quiet when he wins a race and

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.030 
it's even quiet when he wins a race and
usually<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.840> Australians<00:02:58.380> quiet<00:02:58.709> down<00:02:58.980> for

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
usually the Australians quiet down for

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.560 
usually the Australians quiet down for
the<00:02:59.340> Americans<00:02:59.910> because<00:03:00.000> they're<00:03:00.240> rooting

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
the Americans because they're rooting

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
for the Australian so much but I think

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.710 
for the Australian so much but I think

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
you're right I think it's there's so

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.890 
you're right I think it's there's so
much<00:03:04.080> in<00:03:04.320> awe<00:03:04.560> of<00:03:05.010> this<00:03:05.760> swimmer<00:03:06.090> that<00:03:06.209> they

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
just they're left speechless I think

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.900 
just they're left speechless I think
this<00:03:09.390> is<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.660> same<00:03:10.280> approach<00:03:11.280> not<00:03:11.610> this

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
this is the same approach not this

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.370 
this is the same approach not this
