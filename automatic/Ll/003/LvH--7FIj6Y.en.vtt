00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
I'm putting that on my 4 millimeter hook

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.369 
I'm putting that on my 4 millimeter hook
my<00:00:46.980> yarn<00:00:47.250> did<00:00:47.550> call<00:00:47.850> for<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:48.270> 6<00:00:48.570> millimeter<00:00:48.840> hook

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
my yarn did call for a 6 millimeter hook

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.040 
my yarn did call for a 6 millimeter hook
but<00:00:50.070> because<00:00:50.489> we're<00:00:50.789> going<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.300> be<00:00:51.420> stuffing

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
but because we're going to be stuffing

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.250 
but because we're going to be stuffing
her<00:00:52.320> we<00:00:53.070> are<00:00:53.309> actually<00:00:53.699> going<00:00:54.149> down<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.930> sizes

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
her we are actually going down to sizes

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.400 
her we are actually going down to sizes
so<00:00:55.800> I'm<00:00:55.920> using<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.370> 4<00:00:56.640> millimeter<00:00:57.149> hook<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.719> I

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
so I'm using a 4 millimeter hook and I

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.110 
so I'm using a 4 millimeter hook and I
am<00:00:58.530> going<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:59.010> begin<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.489> pattern<00:00:59.910> by

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
am going to begin the pattern by

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.180 
am going to begin the pattern by
chaining<00:01:00.539> two<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.379> thought<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:01.829> would<00:01:02.010> be<00:01:02.070> a

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
chaining two I thought this would be a

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.799 
chaining two I thought this would be a
little<00:01:02.489> easier<00:01:02.910> for<00:01:02.969> everyone<00:01:03.359> than<00:01:03.719> the

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
little easier for everyone than the

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.179 
little easier for everyone than the
magic<00:01:04.199> ring<00:01:05.630> for<00:01:06.630> our<00:01:06.900> first<00:01:07.290> round<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
forming the toe now and for round three

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.390 
forming the toe now and for round three

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.130 
we are going to do an increase and for
the<00:02:46.520> increase<00:02:47.000> we<00:02:47.209> are<00:02:47.240> going<00:02:47.540> to<00:02:47.690> do<00:02:47.810> two

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
the increase we are going to do two

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.949 
the increase we are going to do two
single<00:02:48.650> crochet<00:02:49.160> in<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.880> first<00:02:50.120> stitch<00:02:50.360> and

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
single crochet in the first stitch and

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.260 
single crochet in the first stitch and
then<00:02:51.709> one<00:02:51.980> single<00:02:52.250> crochet<00:02:52.820> in<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.240> next

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
then one single crochet in the next

00:02:53.270 --> 00:03:01.770 
then one single crochet in the next
stitch<00:02:53.660> and<00:02:54.400> we<00:02:55.400> will<00:02:55.520> be<00:02:55.640> doing<00:02:55.730> that<00:02:55.880> twice

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.420 

so<00:03:02.780> in<00:03:02.930> that<00:03:03.050> first<00:03:03.110> stitch<00:03:03.709> we<00:03:03.890> will<00:03:03.920> do<00:03:04.160> two

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
so in that first stitch we will do two

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.650 
so in that first stitch we will do two
single<00:03:04.880> crochet<00:03:05.360> and<00:03:06.820> in<00:03:07.820> the<00:03:07.850> next<00:03:08.180> stitch<00:03:08.450> we

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
will do one single crochet in the next

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:24.830 
will do one single crochet in the next
stitch<00:03:16.550> we<00:03:16.790> will<00:03:16.850> do<00:03:17.090> two<00:03:17.390> single<00:03:17.690> crochet

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.309 

and<00:03:26.090> in<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.239> next<00:03:27.390> stitch<00:03:27.630> we<00:03:27.780> will<00:03:27.840> do<00:03:28.080> one

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
and in the next stitch we will do one

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.979 
and in the next stitch we will do one
single<00:03:28.620> crochet<00:03:28.910> so<00:03:29.910> now<00:03:30.150> we<00:03:30.209> actually<00:03:30.540> have

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
single crochet so now we actually have

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.680 
single crochet so now we actually have
six<00:03:31.290> single<00:03:31.709> crochet<00:03:32.130> around<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:33.060> we've<00:03:33.450> done

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
six single crochet around and we've done

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.680 
six single crochet around and we've done
a<00:03:33.750> little<00:03:33.989> bit<00:03:34.200> of<00:03:34.260> an<00:03:34.560> increase<00:03:37.640> for<00:03:38.640> rows<00:03:38.849> 5<00:03:39.270> &amp;

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
a little bit of an increase for rows 5 &amp;

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.699 
a little bit of an increase for rows 5 &amp;
6<00:03:40.110> or<00:03:40.500> round<00:03:41.099> 5<00:03:41.580> &amp;<00:03:41.910> 6<00:03:42.120> I<00:03:42.360> should<00:03:42.569> say<00:03:42.810> we<00:03:43.380> will<00:03:43.530> do

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
6 or round 5 &amp; 6 I should say we will do

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.690 
6 or round 5 &amp; 6 I should say we will do
1<00:03:44.099> single<00:03:44.610> crochet<00:03:44.790> in<00:03:45.480> each<00:03:45.750> of<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:45.989> stitches

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
1 single crochet in each of the stitches

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.670 
1 single crochet in each of the stitches
so<00:03:47.700> each<00:03:47.910> round<00:03:48.180> will<00:03:48.450> be<00:03:48.569> a<00:03:48.599> total<00:03:49.080> of<00:03:49.319> 6

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
so each round will be a total of 6

00:03:49.680 --> 00:04:13.860 
so each round will be a total of 6
single<00:03:50.160> crochet

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.229 

as<00:04:14.500> I<00:04:14.709> said<00:04:14.920> it<00:04:15.069> does<00:04:15.250> want<00:04:15.459> to<00:04:15.580> curl<00:04:15.909> up<00:04:15.940> a

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.599 
as I said it does want to curl up a
little<00:04:16.449> bit<00:04:16.780> at<00:04:17.380> the<00:04:17.620> beginning<00:04:17.769> so<00:04:18.310> I'm<00:04:18.400> just

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
little bit at the beginning so I'm just

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.520 
little bit at the beginning so I'm just
constantly<00:04:19.000> sort<00:04:19.479> of<00:04:19.600> sticking<00:04:19.989> my<00:04:20.109> finger<00:04:20.440> in

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
constantly sort of sticking my finger in

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.310 
constantly sort of sticking my finger in
the<00:04:20.620> middle<00:04:20.650> there<00:04:21.070> to<00:04:21.720> uncurl<00:04:22.720> it<00:04:22.930> so<00:04:23.169> that

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
the middle there to uncurl it so that

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.230 
the middle there to uncurl it so that
I'm<00:04:23.440> working<00:04:23.620> my<00:04:23.919> stitches<00:04:24.340> on<00:04:24.550> the<00:04:24.760> outside

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
I'm working my stitches on the outside

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.820 
I'm working my stitches on the outside
rather<00:04:25.570> than<00:04:25.720> inside<00:04:25.900> out<00:04:28.139> never<00:04:29.139> for<00:04:29.530> me<00:04:29.710> and

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
rather than inside out never for me and

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:40.460 
rather than inside out never for me and
it<00:04:29.919> looks<00:04:30.070> like<00:04:30.220> a<00:04:30.340> little<00:04:30.580> bowl

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.670 

so<00:04:41.400> for<00:04:41.640> round<00:04:41.880> six<00:04:42.660> we<00:04:42.990> are<00:04:43.140> going<00:04:43.380> to<00:04:43.530> do

around for round seven and eight we will

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.360 
around for round seven and eight we will
do<00:06:13.910> another<00:06:14.080> increase<00:06:15.080> and<00:06:15.410> for<00:06:15.770> round<00:06:16.010> nine

do another increase and for round nine

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.690

we're<00:06:16.730> going<00:06:16.910> to<00:06:17.030> do<00:06:17.150> three<00:06:17.450> single<00:06:17.750> crochet

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:18.700 
we're going to do three single crochet

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.030 
we're going to do three single crochet
so<00:06:19.700> one<00:06:20.030> in<00:06:20.300> each<00:06:20.540> of<00:06:20.870> the<00:06:21.080> three<00:06:21.350> next

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:22.040 
so one in each of the three next

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.390 
so one in each of the three next
stitches<00:06:23.200> one<00:06:24.200> single<00:06:24.560> crochet<00:06:24.920> in<00:06:25.130> each<00:06:25.220> of

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
stitches one single crochet in each of

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.220

the<00:06:25.520> next<00:06:25.670> three<00:06:25.910> stitches<00:06:25.940> and<00:06:26.660> then<00:06:26.810> two

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:27.230 
the next three stitches and then two

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.200 
the next three stitches and then two
single<00:06:27.830> crochet<00:06:28.220> in<00:06:28.490> the<00:06:28.610> next<00:06:28.640> stitch<00:06:29.060> for

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.210 
single crochet in the next stitch for

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:35.890 
single crochet in the next stitch for
our<00:06:29.690> increase<00:06:32.410> and<00:06:34.360> that<00:06:35.360> will<00:06:35.510> bring<00:06:35.690> us<00:06:35.870> up

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
our increase and that will bring us up

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:41.050 
our increase and that will bring us up
to<00:06:36.050> ten<00:06:36.710> single<00:06:37.550> crochet<00:06:38.000> around<00:06:39.940> so<00:06:40.940> the

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:41.060 
to ten single crochet around so the

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.640 
to ten single crochet around so the
first<00:06:41.300> three<00:06:41.540> stitches<00:06:41.750> will<00:06:42.170> be<00:06:42.200> single

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650 
first three stitches will be single

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.470 
first three stitches will be single
crochets<00:06:43.100> and<00:06:43.460> then<00:06:43.520> the<00:06:43.760> next<00:06:44.060> stitch<00:06:44.270> will

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:44.480 
crochets and then the next stitch will

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.370 
crochets and then the next stitch will
be<00:06:44.540> two<00:06:44.720> so<00:06:46.030> two<00:06:47.030> single<00:06:47.420> crochets<00:06:47.810> and<00:06:48.110> so

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:48.380 
be two so two single crochets and so

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.510 
be two so two single crochets and so
that<00:06:48.560> will<00:06:48.680> bring<00:06:48.830> us<00:06:48.950> up<00:06:49.100> to<00:06:49.160> our<00:06:49.280> ten

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.880 
that will bring us up to our ten
stitches<00:06:50.020> and<00:06:51.020> I<00:06:51.170> hope<00:06:51.380> that<00:06:51.560> makes<00:06:51.740> sense

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:51.890

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:00.290 
then for rounds 10 through 60 you will

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:03.190 
then for rounds 10 through 60 you will
just<00:07:00.620> do<00:07:00.860> one<00:07:01.340> single<00:07:01.940> crochet<00:07:02.510> in<00:07:02.900> each

just do one single crochet in each
stitch<00:07:03.470> around<00:07:03.830> so<00:07:04.430> each<00:07:05.060> round<00:07:05.360> will<00:07:05.720> have

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:05.750 
stitch around so each round will have

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:10.660

ten<00:07:06.350> single<00:07:07.040> crochet<00:07:07.640> and<00:07:09.280> basically<00:07:10.280> you'll

the legs to be shorter you can

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.250 
the legs to be shorter you can
definitely<00:07:16.070> decrease<00:07:16.970> that<00:07:17.330> and<00:07:17.750> maybe<00:07:17.990> just

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:18.260 
definitely decrease that and maybe just

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.740 
definitely decrease that and maybe just
do<00:07:18.530> 50<00:07:19.040> rounds<00:07:19.610> it's<00:07:19.760> totally<00:07:20.330> up<00:07:20.450> to<00:07:20.480> you

the end like I'm pretending I am here

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.040 
the end like I'm pretending I am here
you're<00:07:35.480> just<00:07:35.540> going<00:07:35.990> to<00:07:36.020> tie<00:07:36.380> it<00:07:36.440> off<00:07:36.800> pull<00:07:37.370> the

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:38.050 
you're just going to tie it off pull the

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:41.530 
you're just going to tie it off pull the
snipped<00:07:39.050> tail<00:07:39.650> through<00:07:40.280> the<00:07:40.310> loop<00:07:40.430> and<00:07:40.940> I

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:41.540 
snipped tail through the loop and I

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.870 
snipped tail through the loop and I
suggest<00:07:41.960> stuffing<00:07:42.500> it<00:07:42.650> as<00:07:42.770> you<00:07:43.220> go<00:07:43.430> that's<00:07:43.760> a

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:43.880 
suggest stuffing it as you go that's a

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.940 
suggest stuffing it as you go that's a
lot<00:07:44.060> easier<00:07:44.480> than<00:07:44.630> trying<00:07:44.870> to<00:07:45.020> stuff<00:07:45.440> the

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:45.950 
lot easier than trying to stuff the

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:48.610 
lot easier than trying to stuff the
stuffing<00:07:46.610> down<00:07:46.850> the<00:07:47.150> very<00:07:47.360> long<00:07:47.660> legs<00:07:47.990> so<00:07:48.410> just

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:48.620 
stuffing down the very long legs so just

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:49.840 
stuffing down the very long legs so just
put<00:07:48.770> a<00:07:48.800> little<00:07:48.980> stuffing<00:07:49.430> in<00:07:49.520> there<00:07:49.640> as<00:07:49.820> you
