00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.130 
up kill shot or headshots and that is on
the<00:01:15.869> way<00:01:16.259> out<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.979> get<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.850> Power<00:01:18.090> Cell<00:01:18.479> for<00:01:18.990> a

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
the way out to get the Power Cell for a

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.109 
the way out to get the Power Cell for a
she<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.590> that's<00:01:20.280> when<00:01:20.490> you'll<00:01:20.670> discover<00:01:20.939> your

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
she and that's when you'll discover your

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.640 
she and that's when you'll discover your
leash<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:22.049> kind<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.290> your<00:01:22.439> last

leash so this is kind of your last

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.399 
leash so this is kind of your last
chance<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.250> think<00:01:23.640> unless<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.600> your<00:01:25.259> first

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409

these guys to make it easier to head
shot<00:01:47.399> them<00:01:47.579> because<00:01:47.729> they<00:01:47.820> do<00:01:47.880> go<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.180> slow

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
shot them because they do go in slow

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.060 
shot them because they do go in slow
motion<00:01:48.540> when<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.840> pick<00:01:49.049> them<00:01:49.170> I'm<00:01:49.619> just<00:01:49.860> for

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
motion when you pick them I'm just for

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.410 
motion when you pick them I'm just for
some<00:01:50.220> reason<00:01:50.520> making<00:01:50.939> things<00:01:51.119> harder<00:01:51.360> on

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
some reason making things harder on

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.929 
some reason making things harder on
myself<00:01:51.600> I'm<00:01:52.259> trying<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.619> get<00:01:52.770> headshots<00:01:53.579> on

myself I'm trying to get headshots on
guys<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.270> are<00:01:54.360> moving<00:01:54.450> very<00:01:54.630> quickly<00:01:54.810> for

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
guys that are moving very quickly for

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:56.990 
guys that are moving very quickly for
some<00:01:55.799> reason<00:01:56.070> they<00:01:56.159> slow<00:01:56.369> down<00:01:56.399> yeah<00:01:56.820> there

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
some reason they slow down yeah there

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.850 
some reason they slow down yeah there
you<00:01:57.090> go<00:01:57.119> like<00:01:57.600> they're<00:01:57.780> in<00:01:57.869> slow<00:01:58.049> motion<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.500> was

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
you go like they're in slow motion I was

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.240 
you go like they're in slow motion I was
reloading<00:01:59.189> there<00:01:59.430> unfortunately<00:01:59.700> but<00:02:00.570> uh

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
reloading there unfortunately but uh

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.380 
reloading there unfortunately but uh
you're<00:02:02.250> some<00:02:02.399> reason<00:02:02.640> going<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.939> slow<00:02:03.119> motion

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
you're some reason going to slow motion

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.530 
you're some reason going to slow motion
you<00:02:03.479> have<00:02:03.600> special<00:02:04.140> magic<00:02:04.469> slow-motion<00:02:04.890> boots

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
you have special magic slow-motion boots

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.900 
you have special magic slow-motion boots
I<00:02:05.630> guess<00:02:06.050> is<00:02:06.260> the<00:02:06.290> only<00:02:06.530> way<00:02:06.680> to<00:02:06.740> explain<00:02:06.920> it<00:02:07.160> so

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
I guess is the only way to explain it so

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.030 
I guess is the only way to explain it so
that's<00:02:08.600> a<00:02:08.720> good<00:02:08.840> thing<00:02:08.899> to<00:02:09.110> use<00:02:09.200> if<00:02:09.920> you're

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
that's a good thing to use if you're

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.540 
that's a good thing to use if you're
trying<00:02:10.190> to<00:02:10.280> get<00:02:10.369> this<00:02:10.550> achievement<00:02:11.050> and<00:02:12.550> yeah

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
trying to get this achievement and yeah

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.910 
trying to get this achievement and yeah
it's<00:02:13.790> well<00:02:14.630> man<00:02:14.840> that<00:02:15.350> guy<00:02:15.440> there<00:02:15.590> was<00:02:15.680> no<00:02:15.800> way

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
it's well man that guy there was no way

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.410 
it's well man that guy there was no way
to<00:02:15.950> get<00:02:16.130> a<00:02:16.160> head<00:02:16.280> shot<00:02:16.340> on<00:02:16.580> him<00:02:16.760> it<00:02:17.120> looks<00:02:17.300> like

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
to get a head shot on him it looks like

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.790 
to get a head shot on him it looks like
I<00:02:17.480> shot<00:02:17.660> that<00:02:17.690> guy<00:02:17.930> in<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.080> throat<00:02:18.350> that

for a long time when you shoot into the

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.330 
for a long time when you shoot into the
throat<00:02:24.920> uh<00:02:25.100> uh<00:02:26.260> gag<00:02:27.260> reflexes<00:02:27.830> the<00:02:27.980> kill<00:02:28.160> shot

throat uh uh gag reflexes the kill shot

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.250 
throat uh uh gag reflexes the kill shot
you<00:02:28.460> get<00:02:28.640> once<00:02:29.000> you<00:02:29.120> get<00:02:29.240> the<00:02:29.330> leash<00:02:29.510> and<00:02:29.840> then
