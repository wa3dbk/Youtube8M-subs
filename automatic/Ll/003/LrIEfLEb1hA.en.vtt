00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:11.219
 when we read in the title of the video gta 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.740
 san andreas 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.020
 We already know that good things will come. 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.480
 be a gameplay video of easter eggs 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.460
 heard of codes or bugs that is the subject 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.439
 of today's video any of these 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.109
 things in gta san andreas 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.390
 It's a lot of fucking and as the title says today 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.670
 it's just the gta san andreas bug 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.420
 I separated some pretty fucks and yes more 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.099
 regulation 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.099
 Let's go to the best blogs in the game. 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.950
 this first book you are seeing 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.120
 he left jay lying down he is very similar 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.500
 with one bank that I showed in 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.410
 first video of the series 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.840
 only there it gets much more distorted and 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.190
 here he does not even lie down 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.190
 it's very scrotal 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.619
 here at this location has a bug that 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.579
 allowed to walk in the sky if I can 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.110
 talk like that, right? 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.750
 You have to have a diet and pec 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.850
 then I go up to a certain height 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.479
 After that you can walk face 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.479
 look at it 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.009
 now let's take advantage of a buggy 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.970
 to enter inside a house and this 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.970
 even let's go 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.330
 in this location where you are 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.280
 seeing the map is the house that you enter 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.950
 You 're welcome, you take advantage of a bug. 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.440
 that you have on the walls and enter is just 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.930
 lean and jump on the garage door and 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.930
 You do not know what's inside. 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.160
 nothing is good all year round but of any 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.220
 form is a place where you can explore 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:53.530
 the entrance looked at take a picture and 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.530
 then exit the same way you entered 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:07.000
 in an offering to satanic bugs 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.000
 nobility games 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.280
 if that was evil imagine this one here 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.980
 Geez that gets you out of your head. 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.360
 bug is very fucking and you play with the 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.910
 character as if nothing had 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.030
 happening type the mule without head looks 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.030
 there 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.700
 in this location here happens to the well 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:17.340
 strange and is the following first 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.079
 pay attention to this size here 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.109
 corner I'll show you 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.240
 he is normal like any other in the game 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.759
 only when you get a certain 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.229
 distance you will not even see now and 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:34.650
 look at him again 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:37.590

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.810
 a person and begins to walk out of nowhere and 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:44.690
 this is repeated every time you give a 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.690
 roll and look again roll 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:02.720
 It could be a shower. 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.250
 one responds characters but the little place 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.920
 weird that they chose to 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.960
 To answer we have a few things to do. 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.480
 talk but broadcast the video first if 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.940
