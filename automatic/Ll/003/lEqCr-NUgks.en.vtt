00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.250
 there are none today we are here in my 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.710
 desktop to see a new program 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.690
 external minecraft okay this in the super 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.690
 master is not a web page like it does 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.840
 like the previous one and you will see this page 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.160
 web which is very useful for people because 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.539
 he likes minecraft a lot and likes 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.490
 have wallpaper while on 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.820
 example the one that we have right now is 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.540
 generated with that web that as I go out 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.890
 here or be a custom skin for 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.809
 try to kill these maps that by 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.910
 I do not know why they have a face like that 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.379
 they're kind of like the clipper a bit 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.969
 amorphous but good no matter how important 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.129
 is that I can create wallpapers 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.079
 personalized and well let's go to it 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.829
 first we do not go to our browser gives 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.199
 just like we want and we put nova skin and 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.430
 we put wallpaper is worth and if not then I 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.920
 put a link that the registration for 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.660
 here it is a generator in 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.000
 wallpaper and minecraft as 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.210
 we can see we have these so far 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.820
 makes a few months ago when almost 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.979
 opened this page were these these 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.680
 up here is the one of tnt vale for 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.909
 back as we can see little by little it 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.130
 they are updating because here it says 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.320
 how to create your own personalized te 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.310
 says like with cinema 4d if you know but 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.720
 you do not know how to make cinema 4d, you can 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.660
 create a voucher here explain it to you 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.460
 and see how to move there's a lot there are many and 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.460
 many have more than one person 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.080
 example the winner or west has a 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.440
 tom of people and thanks that for 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.330
 put you and a friend or a good fan without 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.400
 whoever you want in this case in which 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.610
 used up this and we're going to create another 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.610
 for example 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.750
 this same vale 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:51.390
 I give it to you and this page opens here 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.070
 is the skin by default and we have the 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.900
 options for the skin if we have 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.940
 minecraft premium and we have the skin 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.180
 put then it would be as much as put here 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:03.480
 our name and then we give it here 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.040
 would enable him we would be here and if 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:10.619
 will put the skin that we have put here in 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:12.510
 this case it will get my skin worth 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.120
 we have the other option that is if we have 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.640
 the charged dye then to upload it 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.360
 basically it's worth in this case, I do not know 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.100
 who to put here let's put the iep 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.680
 but you can put any other 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.510
 person should not be this that puts 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.460
 your nick can put another what 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.610
 you want is worth as we can see they are jeff 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.230
 and me and after all this we read here 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.760
 well we select the activity that 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.950
 I want to rely on our computer 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.740
 as I have a 1080 screen so I can 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.170
 put the 1080 but it's also this 720 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.670
 depends your screen and here then there 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.320
 to put a filter for example if 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.120
 I put 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.890
 old boot now when this is loaded 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.540
 it is like a filter above 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.280
 that we would not be defined by 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.470
 example now looks one more way 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.690
 I do not know, I always leave as is 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.730
 in nor basically nothing 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.130
 I leave you as I do not know why I like it 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.470
 If more than here, we have 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.680
 the image format that we want and you 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.680
 2 lohan give itself and here we download 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.500
 the skin is worth the image can 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.790
 leave it here and as we can see we have 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.610
 already made a wallpaper 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.350
 now we go to this image the production 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.660
 for another thing as we can see if the 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.250
 background you see right click and 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.290
 set of desktop background as 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.090
 we can see this image of fundes 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.880
 criterion how bad it has here a 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.430
 small watermark that says the page 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.520
 but good as covering it with icons or 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.840
 something like that but basically I do not think 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.820
 nothing happens because there is a small brand 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.470
 of water is also a very cool thing 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.050
 because for example 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.690
 they are very much in high quality and also 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.900
 is personalized this is an example of 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.700
 one let's do for example another 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.420
 Well, I 'm going to show you three that I have 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.340
 for example where is there one that 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.989
 he's had it a long time ago 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.720
 only many tutorials you saw with 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.550
 is 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.740
 this is the same as the dragon I put 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.240
 here in this case has loaded the two of 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.420
 before but I can put one and that this 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:17.239
 for example group no no no 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.069
 if it is not put in its place yes 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:24.849
 blume is a developer of minecraft 

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:28.130
 for example it is the sixth 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:29.930
 good no no no no no we will not load 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.569
 because it is in the previous image we 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.860
 we return to give there and now if the cyclone 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:37.930
 whether it is we already have 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.879
 we give right click to establish image 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.849
 background and we have our background 

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:45.430
 desk with the image and with group 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:47.580
 I have others for example I like this 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.580
 quite 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:56.300
 if it's me new delhi night and very cool and 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.470
 here I have another for example extra of 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.450
 I walk the villagers but there are good 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.580
 many more and with the link of the dragon there 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.770
 with chests and with TNT and how can I see 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.409
 there are many we can is free that is 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.629
 we can create all we want 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:11.330
 and with nothing and this is the page 

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:13.759
 basically it is very cool I recommend 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.219
 100% if you are going to write a written background 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:17.599
 and minecraft use this since I do not know to me 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:20.419
 I liked a lot while the 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:23.089
 stopped and well I hope you liked this
