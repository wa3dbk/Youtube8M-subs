a freeze-frame by selecting and then
swiping<00:02:14.990> up<00:02:15.400> this<00:02:16.400> makes<00:02:16.730> a<00:02:16.910> still<00:02:17.270> image<00:02:17.450> from

swiping up this makes a still image from

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.820 
swiping up this makes a still image from
the<00:02:18.110> point<00:02:18.410> at<00:02:18.590> which<00:02:18.740> your<00:02:18.980> playhead<00:02:19.340> was<00:02:19.520> set

another<00:02:21.830> useful<00:02:22.100> tool<00:02:22.489> is<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:22.880> precision

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
another useful tool is the precision

another useful tool is the precision
editor<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:24.530> can<00:02:24.709> access<00:02:25.130> this<00:02:25.400> either<00:02:26.090> by

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
editor you can access this either by

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.750 
editor you can access this either by
tapping<00:02:26.840> a<00:02:27.110> transition<00:02:27.709> and<00:02:27.950> then<00:02:28.280> tapping

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
tapping a transition and then tapping

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.449 
tapping a transition and then tapping
the<00:02:28.880> yellow<00:02:29.090> triangles<00:02:29.720> underneath<00:02:30.110> it<00:02:30.290> or<00:02:31.160> by

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
the yellow triangles underneath it or by

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.370 
the yellow triangles underneath it or by
doing<00:02:31.520> an<00:02:31.940> up-and-down<00:02:32.420> pinch<00:02:33.020> at<00:02:33.320> a

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
doing an up-and-down pinch at a

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.300 
doing an up-and-down pinch at a
transition<00:02:34.070> point<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:36.200> precision<00:02:36.739> editor<00:02:36.860> is

transition point the precision editor is

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.400 
transition point the precision editor is
especially<00:02:37.820> useful<00:02:38.150> with<00:02:38.510> video<00:02:38.840> clips<00:02:39.200> and

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
especially useful with video clips and

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.250 
especially useful with video clips and
