the<00:00:04.170> Nana's<00:00:04.500> collection<00:00:04.890> have<00:00:05.040> brought<00:00:05.640> some

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
the Nana's collection have brought some

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.400 
the Nana's collection have brought some
of<00:00:05.970> my<00:00:06.000> work<00:00:06.240> in<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.870> past

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
of my work in the past

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.110 
of my work in the past
they're<00:00:07.710> quite<00:00:07.950> busy<00:00:08.130> collaborating<00:00:09.000> with

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
they're quite busy collaborating with

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.879 
they're quite busy collaborating with
artists<00:00:09.540> especially<00:00:09.809> younger<00:00:10.410> artists<00:00:10.710> that

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
artists especially younger artists that

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.379 
artists especially younger artists that
might<00:00:11.070> not<00:00:11.250> have<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.610> financial<00:00:12.059> backup

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
might not have the financial backup

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.890 
might not have the financial backup
let's<00:00:13.259> talk<00:00:13.679> first<00:00:14.570> that<00:00:15.570> gathers<00:00:15.870> a

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
let's talk first that gathers a

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.930 
let's talk first that gathers a
photograph<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.949> measurements<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:17.640> what

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
photograph and the measurements of what

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.029 
photograph and the measurements of what
the<00:00:18.119> mirror<00:00:18.420> will<00:00:18.660> be<00:00:18.690> but<00:00:19.140> it's<00:00:19.830> very

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
the mirror will be but it's very

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.679 
the mirror will be but it's very
difficult<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.640> imagine<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.060> if<00:00:21.420> you're<00:00:21.570> not

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
difficult to imagine that if you're not

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.730 
difficult to imagine that if you're not
in<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:22.080> space<00:00:22.320> itself

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
in the space itself

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.160 
in the space itself
we<00:00:25.740> had<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.890> canvas<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.430> was<00:00:26.789> reduced<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.720> four

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
we had a canvas that was reduced to four

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.859 
we had a canvas that was reduced to four
meters<00:00:28.320> by<00:00:28.800> 1.2<00:00:29.340> meters<00:00:29.880> we<00:00:30.330> knew<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.689> would

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
meters by 1.2 meters we knew that would

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.990 
meters by 1.2 meters we knew that would
be<00:00:31.019> blown<00:00:31.289> up<00:00:31.320> if<00:00:31.980> they<00:00:32.160> were<00:00:32.309> cut<00:00:32.520> Chasseur

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.880 

it's<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.090> long<00:00:36.329> ways<00:00:36.600> from<00:00:36.719> New<00:00:36.930> York<00:00:37.110> that's

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
it's a long ways from New York that's

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:48.529 
it's a long ways from New York that's
for<00:00:38.100> sure<00:00:45.590> when<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.620> first<00:00:46.950> saw<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.820> piece<00:00:48.149> and

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
for sure when I first saw this piece and

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.840 
for sure when I first saw this piece and
we<00:00:49.379> were<00:00:49.590> told<00:00:49.980> we<00:00:50.129> were<00:00:50.160> gonna<00:00:50.309> come<00:00:50.550> out<00:00:50.670> here

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
we were told we were gonna come out here

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.950 
we were told we were gonna come out here
and<00:00:50.940> work<00:00:51.059> on<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.570> got<00:00:51.719> pretty<00:00:51.840> excited

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
and work on it I got pretty excited

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.959 
and work on it I got pretty excited
about<00:00:52.320> this<00:00:52.590> one

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.160 

getting<00:00:56.969> here<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.300> actually<00:00:57.629> starting<00:00:57.989> like

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
getting here and actually starting like

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.260 
getting here and actually starting like
I<00:00:58.260> think<00:00:58.500> it's<00:00:58.620> bigger<00:00:58.920> than<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.309> realized

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.939 

what<00:01:03.270> we<00:01:03.390> do<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.750> we<00:01:03.899> print<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.290> out<00:01:04.530> as<00:01:04.799> each

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
what we do is we print this out as each

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.010 
what we do is we print this out as each
four<00:01:05.189> foot<00:01:05.400> section<00:01:05.790> represents<00:01:06.360> I've<00:01:06.750> wall

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
four foot section represents I've wall

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.929 
four foot section represents I've wall
up<00:01:07.170> paper<00:01:07.560> which<00:01:07.740> we<00:01:07.830> projected<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.460> sections

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
up paper which we projected in sections

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.580 
up paper which we projected in sections
and<00:01:09.510> then<00:01:09.630> we<00:01:09.720> use<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.869> machine<00:01:10.200> called<00:01:10.380> an

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
and then we use a machine called an

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.440 
and then we use a machine called an
electric<00:01:10.979> pencil<00:01:11.159> basically<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:11.939> like<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.270> find

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
electric pencil basically I like to find

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.179 
electric pencil basically I like to find
a<00:01:12.540> pen<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.990> we<00:01:13.049> just<00:01:13.260> draw<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.830> what<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.040> does

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
a pen and we just draw and what it does

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.100 
a pen and we just draw and what it does
is<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.460> burns<00:01:14.640> little<00:01:14.880> holes<00:01:15.060> everywhere<00:01:15.360> yeah

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
is it burns little holes everywhere yeah

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.230 
is it burns little holes everywhere yeah
and<00:01:16.500> then<00:01:16.619> we've<00:01:16.740> robust<00:01:17.130> charcoal<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.180> is

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
and then we've robust charcoal this is

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.810 
and then we've robust charcoal this is
just<00:01:18.509> powdered<00:01:18.960> charcoal<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:20.460> charcoal

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
just powdered charcoal the charcoal

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.270 
just powdered charcoal the charcoal
transfers<00:01:21.360> through<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.900> paper

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
transfers through the paper

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.520 
transfers through the paper
it<00:01:23.520> needs<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.940> little<00:01:24.060> bit<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.510> drama<00:01:25.200> class

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
it needs a little bit of a drama class

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.230 
it needs a little bit of a drama class
and<00:01:25.860> then<00:01:25.950> will<00:01:26.100> usually<00:01:26.250> turn<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.820> vibrator

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
and then will usually turn the vibrator

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.180 
and then will usually turn the vibrator
in<00:01:27.450> or<00:01:27.570> use<00:01:27.690> a<00:01:27.720> pencil<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.320> draw<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:28.740> that's

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
in or use a pencil and draw it in that's

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.070 
in or use a pencil and draw it in that's
the<00:01:29.369> process<00:01:29.850> it's<00:01:30.180> been<00:01:30.270> used<00:01:30.510> about<00:01:30.750> 100

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
the process it's been used about 100

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:39.649 
the process it's been used about 100
years<00:01:36.740> normally<00:01:37.740> my<00:01:38.009> work<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.759> all<00:01:39.030> abstract

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
years normally my work is all abstract

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.170 
years normally my work is all abstract
works<00:01:40.050> but<00:01:40.470> for<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:41.009> was<00:01:41.190> thinking<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:41.970> a

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
works but for this I was thinking of a

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.910 
works but for this I was thinking of a
city<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.960> they're<00:01:43.170> kind<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.409> vibrancy<00:01:43.890> that

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
city and they're kind of vibrancy that

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.980 
city and they're kind of vibrancy that
city<00:01:44.190> city<00:01:44.490> on<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.820> right<00:01:45.000> with<00:01:45.210> Satine<00:01:45.570> oh<00:01:45.840> it

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
city city on the right with Satine oh it

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.109 
city city on the right with Satine oh it
wasn't<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.440> presses<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.159> three<00:01:47.430> typing<00:01:47.909> and

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
wasn't it presses of three typing and

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.270 
wasn't it presses of three typing and
renewal<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.750> then<00:01:48.899> collects<00:01:49.380> again<00:01:49.619> kind<00:01:50.159> of

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
renewal and then collects again kind of

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.520 
renewal and then collects again kind of
speaks<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.670> me<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:50.820> really<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.299> like<00:01:51.570> Abstract

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
speaks to me I really I like Abstract

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.200 
speaks to me I really I like Abstract
Expressionism<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.430> like<00:01:53.610> all<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.090> different

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
Expressionism I like all the different

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.190 
Expressionism I like all the different
textures

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
textures

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.760 
textures
I<00:01:59.420> wanted<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:00.570> thing<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.259> deflects

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
I wanted this thing to to deflects

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.590 
I wanted this thing to to deflects
possibly<00:02:02.490> cracking<00:02:02.880> up<00:02:03.030> we<00:02:03.210> might<00:02:03.390> be<00:02:03.479> coming

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
possibly cracking up we might be coming

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.090 
possibly cracking up we might be coming
together<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:04.259> think<00:02:04.380> it's<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.649> really<00:02:04.830> cool

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
together I think it's a really cool

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.880 
together I think it's a really cool
strong<00:02:05.429> image<00:02:05.789> I<00:02:08.929> saw<00:02:09.929> like<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.229> mock-up<00:02:10.560> of

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
strong image I saw like a mock-up of

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.930 
strong image I saw like a mock-up of
what<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.250> would<00:02:11.340> look<00:02:11.459> like<00:02:11.519> in<00:02:11.790> this

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
what it would look like in this

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.520 
what it would look like in this
courtyard<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.540> then<00:02:12.660> but<00:02:12.930> then<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.410> was

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
courtyard and then but then it was

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.420 
courtyard and then but then it was
pretty<00:02:13.709> epic<00:02:15.860> they<00:02:16.860> looked<00:02:17.130> quite

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
pretty epic they looked quite

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.550 
pretty epic they looked quite
differently<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:18.209> how<00:02:18.450> I<00:02:18.480> look<00:02:18.900> I<00:02:19.200> like

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
differently to how I look I like

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.590 
differently to how I look I like
painting<00:02:19.860> stuff<00:02:20.069> like<00:02:20.190> this<00:02:20.430> because<00:02:20.880> most<00:02:21.450> of

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
painting stuff like this because most of

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.030 
painting stuff like this because most of
the<00:02:21.690> time<00:02:21.870> we're<00:02:22.050> painting<00:02:22.230> from<00:02:22.500> photographs

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
the time we're painting from photographs

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.880 
the time we're painting from photographs
and<00:02:23.730> mis<00:02:24.030> allows<00:02:24.330> us<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.290> think<00:02:25.530> about<00:02:25.590> his

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
and mis allows us to think about his

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.030 
and mis allows us to think about his
process<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:28.170> first<00:02:28.380> thing<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:28.739> learn<00:02:28.860> how<00:02:29.010> to

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
process the first thing you learn how to

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.220 
process the first thing you learn how to
do<00:02:29.250> what<00:02:29.400> our<00:02:29.519> job<00:02:29.790> is<00:02:29.820> how<00:02:30.660> to<00:02:30.720> cut<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:30.959> straight

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
do what our job is how to cut a straight

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.759 
do what our job is how to cut a straight
line<00:02:31.790> and<00:02:32.790> that's<00:02:33.239> entirely<00:02:34.019> what<00:02:34.350> this<00:02:34.530> is

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
line and that's entirely what this is

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.880 
line and that's entirely what this is
matching<00:02:35.519> color<00:02:35.730> straight<00:02:36.450> line<00:02:36.690> washes<00:02:37.440> it's

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
matching color straight line washes it's

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.680 
matching color straight line washes it's
all<00:02:37.950> about<00:02:38.190> technique<00:02:38.579> challenge<00:02:39.540> is

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
all about technique challenge is

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.120 
all about technique challenge is
probably<00:02:39.870> just<00:02:40.200> all<00:02:40.440> these<00:02:40.560> triangles<00:02:43.130> these

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
probably just all these triangles these

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.660 
probably just all these triangles these
lot<00:02:44.370> of<00:02:44.430> triangles<00:02:44.720> want<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.810> do<00:02:45.930> it<00:02:46.079> right

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
lot of triangles want to do it right

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.370 
lot of triangles want to do it right
make<00:02:47.670> sure<00:02:47.880> that<00:02:48.030> he's<00:02:48.209> really<00:02:48.870> really<00:02:49.019> happy

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
make sure that he's really really happy

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.509 
make sure that he's really really happy
about<00:02:49.470> it

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.220 

it's<00:02:55.519> probably<00:02:56.150> pretty<00:02:56.299> overwhelming<00:02:57.079> at

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
it's probably pretty overwhelming at

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.229 
it's probably pretty overwhelming at
first<00:02:57.260> to<00:02:57.620> see<00:02:57.650> your<00:02:57.980> work<00:02:58.159> so<00:02:58.579> large

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
first to see your work so large

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.780 
first to see your work so large
I<00:02:59.799> didn't<00:03:00.799> realize<00:03:01.129> it<00:03:01.159> was<00:03:01.370> going<00:03:01.519> to<00:03:01.610> be<00:03:01.670> this

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
I didn't realize it was going to be this

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.569 
I didn't realize it was going to be this
this<00:03:02.060> big<00:03:02.390> I<00:03:02.720> think<00:03:03.560> it's<00:03:03.769> what<00:03:04.129> nice<00:03:04.340> I'm

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
this big I think it's what nice I'm

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:29.850 
this big I think it's what nice I'm
quite<00:03:04.790> happy

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860
