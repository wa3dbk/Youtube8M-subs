00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.670 
some consistent training in them but if
you<00:01:16.770> see<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.390> it's<00:01:18.390> almost<00:01:18.810> like<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.350> upper

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
you see that it's almost like the upper

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.429 
you see that it's almost like the upper
is<00:01:19.830> ripping<00:01:20.340> away<00:01:20.520> from<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.119> outsole<00:01:21.509> almost

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
is ripping away from the outsole almost

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.050 
is ripping away from the outsole almost
like<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.680> uppers<00:01:22.979> too<00:01:23.250> soft<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.820> not<00:01:23.939> as

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
like the uppers too soft and not as

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.690 
like the uppers too soft and not as
durable<00:01:24.360> as<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.900> would<00:01:25.049> like<00:01:25.340> especially<00:01:26.340> you

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
durable as you would like especially you

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.670 
durable as you would like especially you
got<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.000> think<00:01:27.180> you're<00:01:27.780> about<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.080> spend<00:01:28.500> two

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
got to think you're about to spend two

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.620 
got to think you're about to spend two
hundred<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.100> twenty<00:01:29.400> dollars<00:01:29.790> on<00:01:29.970> this<00:01:30.360> boot

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
hundred and twenty dollars on this boot

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.649 
hundred and twenty dollars on this boot
so<00:01:31.590> I've<00:01:31.799> only<00:01:32.009> put<00:01:32.280> 40<00:01:32.610> hours<00:01:32.850> in<00:01:32.970> mind<00:01:33.210> that's

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
so I've only put 40 hours in mind that's

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.800 
so I've only put 40 hours in mind that's
not<00:01:33.900> even<00:01:33.930> two<00:01:34.350> months<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.740> use<00:01:35.119> so<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.180> think<00:01:36.659> it

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
not even two months of use so I think it

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.050 
not even two months of use so I think it
could<00:01:37.020> be<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.259> little<00:01:37.470> concern<00:01:37.890> especially<00:01:38.640> if

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
could be a little concern especially if

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.460 
could be a little concern especially if
you're<00:01:39.299> spending<00:01:39.720> two<00:01:39.840> hundred<00:01:40.049> dollars<00:01:40.290> for

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
you're spending two hundred dollars for

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.850 
you're spending two hundred dollars for
your<00:01:40.619> boots<00:01:41.450> you<00:01:42.450> might<00:01:43.320> want<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.680> go<00:01:43.740> with

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
your boots you might want to go with

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.340 
your boots you might want to go with
something<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.310> little<00:01:44.520> more<00:01:44.640> durable<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:46.200> is

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
something a little more durable it is

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.260 
something a little more durable it is

I have a wider fatter foot so with the

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.660 
I have a wider fatter foot so with the
less<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.909> it's<00:02:00.210> actually<00:02:01.399> forming<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.490> hole

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
less you it's actually forming a hole

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.569 
less you it's actually forming a hole
right<00:02:02.969> there<00:02:03.810> on<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.259> outside<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.430> it's

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
right there on the outside so it's

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.719 
right there on the outside so it's
almost<00:02:05.880> like<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.360> upper<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:06.960> ripping<00:02:07.500> away

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
almost like the upper is ripping away

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.639 
almost like the upper is ripping away
from<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.970> outsole<00:02:09.360> because<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.899> shoe<00:02:10.229> in<00:02:10.500> the

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
from the outsole because the shoe in the

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.250 
from the outsole because the shoe in the
upper<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.190> that<00:02:12.060> that<00:02:12.480> pie<00:02:12.870> of

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
upper is that that pie of

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.940 
upper is that that pie of
so<00:02:14.260> it<00:02:14.380> could<00:02:14.680> be<00:02:14.760> could<00:02:15.760> be<00:02:15.820> a<00:02:16.000> design<00:02:16.450> flaw

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
so it could be could be a design flaw

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.250 
so it could be could be a design flaw
all's<00:02:17.950> I<00:02:18.310> know<00:02:18.370> is<00:02:18.490> the<00:02:19.180> durability<00:02:19.420> on<00:02:20.110> the

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
all's I know is the durability on the

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.930 
all's I know is the durability on the
mercurial<00:02:20.650> vapor<00:02:20.950> 8<00:02:21.100> is<00:02:21.280> something<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:21.820> be

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
mercurial vapor 8 is something to be

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.390 
mercurial vapor 8 is something to be
aware<00:02:22.030> of<00:02:22.210> and<00:02:22.570> I<00:02:22.990> think<00:02:23.020> many<00:02:23.590> consume<00:02:24.070> many

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
aware of and I think many consume many

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.240 
aware of and I think many consume many
consumers<00:02:25.180> should<00:02:25.210> be<00:02:25.630> aware<00:02:25.840> of<00:02:25.900> this

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
consumers should be aware of this

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.460 
consumers should be aware of this
because<00:02:27.250> if<00:02:27.730> you're<00:02:27.850> spending<00:02:28.210> 220<00:02:28.870> bucks<00:02:29.140> on

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
because if you're spending 220 bucks on

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.280 
because if you're spending 220 bucks on
a<00:02:29.530> boot<00:02:30.370> you<00:02:31.360> definitely<00:02:31.660> at<00:02:31.900> least<00:02:31.930> want<00:02:32.230> to

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
a boot you definitely at least want to

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.380 
a boot you definitely at least want to

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
nowhere close to evening having these

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
just want to give you guys an update and

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.460 
just want to give you guys an update and
a<00:02:46.420> lot<00:02:46.630> of<00:02:46.660> people<00:02:46.750> been<00:02:47.050> asking<00:02:47.230> questions

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
a lot of people been asking questions

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.100 
a lot of people been asking questions
about<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.160> boots<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:49.660> know<00:02:49.690> how<00:02:50.050> the

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
about the boots you know how the

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.530 
about the boots you know how the
durability<00:02:50.680> very<00:02:51.580> very<00:02:51.820> comfortable<00:02:52.330> group

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
durability very very comfortable group

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.500 
durability very very comfortable group
but<00:02:52.870> i<00:02:52.900> think<00:02:53.170> in<00:02:53.290> terms<00:02:53.320> of<00:02:53.620> durability<00:02:54.510> there

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
but i think in terms of durability there

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.970 
but i think in terms of durability there
might<00:02:55.660> be<00:02:55.690> some<00:02:56.020> better<00:02:56.200> options<00:02:56.290> out<00:02:56.950> there

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
might be some better options out there

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.610 
might be some better options out there
so<00:02:57.850> just<00:02:58.060> something<00:02:58.360> to<00:02:58.480> be<00:02:58.540> aware<00:02:58.600> of<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:59.200> if

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
so just something to be aware of and if

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.890 
so just something to be aware of and if
