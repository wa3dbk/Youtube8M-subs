00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
even though technically he was more of

even though technically he was more of
Bret<00:04:27.300> just<00:04:27.630> because<00:04:27.930> I<00:04:28.080> didn't<00:04:28.740> have<00:04:28.830> much

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
Bret just because I didn't have much

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.380 
Bret just because I didn't have much
that<00:04:29.310> was<00:04:29.430> very<00:04:29.520> effective<00:04:30.000> against<00:04:30.300> him

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
that was very effective against him

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.690

after<00:04:30.510> they<00:04:30.720> took<00:04:30.870> up<00:04:31.020> man<00:04:31.260> time<00:04:32.360> um<00:04:34.640> so<00:04:35.640> I

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
after they took up man time um so I

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.300 
after they took up man time um so I
figured<00:04:36.180> you<00:04:36.360> know<00:04:36.480> he'd<00:04:36.810> be<00:04:36.890> bigger<00:04:37.890> threat

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
figured you know he'd be bigger threat

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.640 
figured you know he'd be bigger threat
even<00:04:38.520> though<00:04:38.790> he's<00:04:39.030> using<00:04:39.450> moves<00:04:39.780> like<00:04:40.200> hyper

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650
