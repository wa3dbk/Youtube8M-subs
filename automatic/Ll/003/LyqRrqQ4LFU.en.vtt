00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.080
 That also me, stupid yes, 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.460
 I did not tell you about it. 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.780
 Your lock has long since lost ... 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.540
 Now I know, 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:14.920
 that forever, 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.200
 but that does not mean anything, 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.420
 When I have you, I have you here! Oo ... 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.100
 And I've had all your friends here too, 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.160
 if it is still like this ... 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.140
 (Do you like it? That was missing! The truth!) 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.240
 Who should you be for? 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.420
 A knight joke to be or a brother? 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.860
 What to be for you? 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.640
 Are you just looking at my youth? 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.500
 You think I do not understand anything 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.480
 and I wanted to be with you in this team, 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.520
 because you were having a good time yesterday, 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.840
 though you were quarreling in two ... 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.580
 It was fun! 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.000
 Because you're-oooo, 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.440
 They are friends of Me, 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.720
 You to-oooo, 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.600
 They are friends of Me, 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.720
 And I'm aaaaa 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.760
 yes, talk about you today. I want to! 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.174
 And about you, Jake 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.640
 This song I'm singing to you right now, 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.900
 honestly sing, I want to! 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.180
 Who should you be for? 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.680
 A knight joke to be or a brother? 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.360
 What to be for you? 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.600
 Are you just looking at my youth? 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.660
 You think that I do not understand anything, 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.680
 and I wanted to be with you in this team together. 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.700
 I want to forget about the lost puck, 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.740
 and never a shared pasta! 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.140
 Never no... 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.980
 Because you 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.860
 to-oooo, 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.680
 They are friends of Me! 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.060
 You to-oooo, 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.580
 They are friends of Me 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.200
 And I'm aaaaa 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.640
 I want to talk about you today! 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.040
 And about you, Jake 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.100
 I'm singing this song now, 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.660
 I want to sing honestly. 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.100
 But do not make a mistake. 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.640
 I will sing a song, 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.960
 which will open the door!
