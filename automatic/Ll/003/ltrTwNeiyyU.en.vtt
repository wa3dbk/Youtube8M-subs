measure<00:06:09.560> it<00:06:09.740> it's<00:06:09.919> not<00:06:10.070> going<00:06:10.190> to<00:06:10.250> be

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
measure it it's not going to be

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.950 
measure it it's not going to be
consistent<00:06:10.669> and<00:06:11.060> so<00:06:11.300> we<00:06:11.419> want<00:06:11.600> to<00:06:11.660> be<00:06:11.750> able<00:06:11.810> to

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
consistent and so we want to be able to

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.779 
consistent and so we want to be able to
count<00:06:12.110> on<00:06:12.199> the<00:06:12.320> same<00:06:12.500> Papa<00:06:12.889> John<00:06:13.190> Pizza<00:06:13.580> every
