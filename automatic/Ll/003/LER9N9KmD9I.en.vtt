so<00:00:54.600> I'm<00:00:54.690> going<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.900> keep<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.730> mini-map<00:00:56.730> open

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
so I'm going to keep the mini-map open

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.390

down<00:00:57.690> there<00:00:57.900> so<00:00:58.110> you<00:00:58.170> can<00:00:58.440> see<00:00:58.860> what<00:00:59.100> path<00:00:59.370> to

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
down there so you can see what path to

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.210 
down there so you can see what path to
take<00:00:59.640> the<00:01:00.600> drop<00:01:00.810> rate<00:01:00.930> on<00:01:01.170> these<00:01:01.350> things<00:01:01.800> seems

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
take the drop rate on these things seems

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.719 
take the drop rate on these things seems
to<00:01:02.460> be<00:01:02.610> a<00:01:03.470> like<00:01:04.470> better<00:01:04.739> than<00:01:04.979> most<00:01:05.130> weeks<00:01:05.460> the
