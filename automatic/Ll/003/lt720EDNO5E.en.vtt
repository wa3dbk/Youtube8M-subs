to the house so that you don't have
water<00:00:38.629> shooting<00:00:39.199> all<00:00:39.410> over<00:00:39.579> so<00:00:40.579> I'm<00:00:40.730> going<00:00:40.910> to

that you want to clean out and of course

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.140 
that you want to clean out and of course
you've<00:01:42.680> just<00:01:42.980> turned<00:01:43.220> the<00:01:43.340> water<00:01:43.520> off<00:01:43.700> to<00:01:43.910> the

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
you've just turned the water off to the

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.670 
you've just turned the water off to the
house<00:01:44.420> so<00:01:44.720> you<00:01:44.750> can't<00:01:45.490> clean<00:01:46.490> it<00:01:47.470> okay

house so you can't clean it okay
so<00:01:48.830> over<00:01:49.460> to<00:01:49.580> the<00:01:49.700> filter<00:01:50.530> we<00:01:51.530> also<00:01:52.100> on<00:01:52.370> this

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
so over to the filter we also on this

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.000 
so over to the filter we also on this
particular<00:01:53.390> brand<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.710> dupont<00:01:55.190> have<00:01:56.060> a

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
particular brand the dupont have a

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.210 
particular brand the dupont have a
switcher<00:01:58.010> of<00:01:58.210> valve<00:01:59.210> on<00:01:59.540> top<00:01:59.900> that<00:02:00.800> you<00:02:01.010> can

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
switcher of valve on top that you can

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.300 
switcher of valve on top that you can
turn<00:02:01.520> to<00:02:01.910> shut<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:02.780> water<00:02:02.960> off<00:02:03.170> there<00:02:03.830> which

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
turn to shut the water off there which

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.030 
turn to shut the water off there which
is<00:02:04.520> a<00:02:04.550> good<00:02:04.760> idea<00:02:05.050> also<00:02:06.050> you<00:02:06.140> can<00:02:06.350> see<00:02:06.560> this<00:02:06.710> red

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
is a good idea also you can see this red

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.480 
is a good idea also you can see this red
button<00:02:07.370> that<00:02:07.820> releases<00:02:08.000> pressure<00:02:09.130> but<00:02:10.130> you

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
button that releases pressure but you

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.880 
button that releases pressure but you
don't<00:02:10.760> want<00:02:11.030> to<00:02:11.150> push<00:02:11.420> that<00:02:11.720> right<00:02:12.050> now<00:02:12.380> or

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
don't want to push that right now or

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.250 
don't want to push that right now or
you'll<00:02:13.640> have<00:02:13.850> water<00:02:14.120> shooting<00:02:14.720> everywhere

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
you'll have water shooting everywhere

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.140 
you'll have water shooting everywhere
even<00:02:15.560> though<00:02:16.250> we<00:02:16.430> turned<00:02:16.700> off<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.090> water

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
even though we turned off the water

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.420 
even though we turned off the water
pressure<00:02:17.750> it'd<00:02:18.410> probably<00:02:18.590> be<00:02:18.770> better<00:02:19.010> first

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
pressure it'd probably be better first

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.690 
pressure it'd probably be better first
to<00:02:19.730> go<00:02:19.910> over<00:02:20.209> to<00:02:20.480> a<00:02:20.510> sink<00:02:21.050> and<00:02:21.340> open<00:02:22.340> a<00:02:22.459> valve

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
to go over to a sink and open a valve

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.420 
to go over to a sink and open a valve
and<00:02:23.570> i'm<00:02:23.750> going<00:02:23.959> to<00:02:24.020> open<00:02:24.320> a<00:02:24.410> cold<00:02:24.739> water<00:02:25.010> belt

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
and i'm going to open a cold water belt

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.130 
and i'm going to open a cold water belt
you<00:02:25.700> see<00:02:25.940> water<00:02:26.180> is<00:02:26.510> coming<00:02:27.050> out<00:02:27.550> for<00:02:28.550> now<00:02:28.730> and

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
you see water is coming out for now and

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.800 
you see water is coming out for now and
the

the
and<00:02:31.230> we'll<00:02:31.530> let<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:31.850> relieve<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:33.690> pressure

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
and we'll let that relieve the pressure

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.059 
and we'll let that relieve the pressure

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
that will be on this water filter now

back<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:38.430> our<00:02:38.670> tools<00:02:39.120> here<00:02:39.690> I<00:02:40.620> have<00:02:41.490> found<00:02:41.819> that

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
back to our tools here I have found that

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.130 
back to our tools here I have found that
two<00:02:43.080> wrenches<00:02:43.440> are<00:02:44.010> better<00:02:44.370> than<00:02:44.640> one<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.240> the

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
two wrenches are better than one and the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.880 
two wrenches are better than one and the
extra<00:02:46.980> pipe<00:02:47.310> is<00:02:47.870> something<00:02:48.870> I<00:02:49.020> use<00:02:49.290> on<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.560> end

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
extra pipe is something I use on the end

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.850 
extra pipe is something I use on the end
of<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.220> wrench<00:02:50.489> to<00:02:51.300> get<00:02:51.510> more<00:02:51.780> leverage<00:02:52.080> I'm

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
of the wrench to get more leverage I'm

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.470 
of the wrench to get more leverage I'm
going<00:02:53.040> to<00:02:53.100> go<00:02:53.160> back<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.700> filter<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.239> show

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
going to go back to the filter and show

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.190 
going to go back to the filter and show
you<00:02:54.540> something<00:02:55.080> here<00:02:55.260> this<00:02:55.530> one<00:02:55.800> here

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
you something here this one here

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.320 
you something here this one here
obviously<00:02:58.200> from<00:02:58.560> looking<00:02:58.980> right<00:02:59.190> here<00:02:59.330> this

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
obviously from looking right here this

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.250 
obviously from looking right here this
is<00:03:00.569> what<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.989> wrench<00:03:02.660> focuses<00:03:03.660> on<00:03:03.870> when

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
is what the wrench focuses on when

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.530 
is what the wrench focuses on when
you're<00:03:04.440> doing<00:03:04.800> this<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:05.730> can<00:03:05.880> see<00:03:05.940> this<00:03:06.269> is<00:03:06.510> a

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
you're doing this you can see this is a

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.320 
you're doing this you can see this is a
little<00:03:06.840> shattered<00:03:07.410> here<00:03:07.860> because<00:03:08.340> at<00:03:09.030> one

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
little shattered here because at one

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.590 
little shattered here because at one
time<00:03:10.010> there<00:03:11.010> was<00:03:11.160> difficulty<00:03:11.700> in<00:03:12.060> getting<00:03:12.269> the

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
time there was difficulty in getting the

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.900 
time there was difficulty in getting the
cartridge<00:03:13.080> off<00:03:13.350> and<00:03:13.680> somebody<00:03:14.670> had<00:03:14.790> the

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
cartridge off and somebody had the

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.160 
cartridge off and somebody had the
bright<00:03:14.940> idea<00:03:15.180> I<00:03:16.050> won't<00:03:16.680> say<00:03:16.860> who<00:03:17.069> to<00:03:17.910> tap<00:03:18.720> on<00:03:19.019> it

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
bright idea I won't say who to tap on it

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.890 
bright idea I won't say who to tap on it
with<00:03:19.319> a<00:03:19.350> hammer<00:03:19.709> and<00:03:20.040> it's<00:03:20.370> just<00:03:20.670> plastic<00:03:20.940> so

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
with a hammer and it's just plastic so

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.949 
with a hammer and it's just plastic so
it<00:03:22.050> just<00:03:22.290> shattered<00:03:22.830> so<00:03:23.819> hitting<00:03:24.510> it<00:03:24.690> with<00:03:24.930> a

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
it just shattered so hitting it with a

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.590 
it just shattered so hitting it with a
hammer<00:03:25.080> is<00:03:25.680> not<00:03:25.709> a<00:03:26.069> good<00:03:26.430> idea<00:03:26.459> to<00:03:27.090> loosen<00:03:27.480> it

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
hammer is not a good idea to loosen it

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.690 
hammer is not a good idea to loosen it
up<00:03:27.860> while<00:03:28.860> going<00:03:29.040> back<00:03:29.160> to<00:03:29.700> these<00:03:30.050> filters<00:03:31.050> I

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
up while going back to these filters I

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.380 
up while going back to these filters I
mean<00:03:32.700> to<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:33.090> wrenches<00:03:33.930> and<00:03:34.350> the<00:03:34.590> pipe<00:03:35.329> on<00:03:36.329> the

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
mean to the wrenches and the pipe on the

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.650 
mean to the wrenches and the pipe on the
pipe<00:03:37.140> I<00:03:37.470> had<00:03:38.160> caps<00:03:38.549> on<00:03:38.880> there<00:03:39.120> then<00:03:39.329> I<00:03:39.420> need<00:03:39.630> to

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
pipe I had caps on there then I need to

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.009 
pipe I had caps on there then I need to
take<00:03:39.989> off<00:03:40.290> but<00:03:40.650> I'm<00:03:41.160> going<00:03:41.610> to<00:03:41.820> try<00:03:42.269> to<00:03:42.299> set<00:03:42.750> the

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
take off but I'm going to try to set the

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.990 
take off but I'm going to try to set the
camera<00:03:43.590> down<00:03:43.620> so<00:03:44.190> you<00:03:44.280> can<00:03:44.549> see<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.750> filter

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
camera down so you can see the filter

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.059 
camera down so you can see the filter
and<00:03:50.090> being<00:03:51.090> rough<00:03:51.600> but<00:03:52.049> there<00:03:52.320> we<00:03:52.530> are

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
and being rough but there we are

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.259 
and being rough but there we are
I'm<00:03:54.370> taking<00:03:54.970> these<00:03:55.239> wrenches<00:03:55.989> and<00:03:57.000> I'm<00:03:58.000> going

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
I'm taking these wrenches and I'm going

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.630 
I'm taking these wrenches and I'm going
to<00:03:58.329> put<00:03:58.569> them<00:03:58.689> in<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:58.930> end<00:03:59.140> of<00:03:59.379> the<00:03:59.530> pipe<00:03:59.769> like

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
to put them in the end of the pipe like

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.770 
to put them in the end of the pipe like
that<00:04:01.379> so<00:04:02.379> they're<00:04:02.590> in<00:04:02.709> there<00:04:02.890> together<00:04:03.780> get

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
that so they're in there together get

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.600 
that so they're in there together get
them<00:04:04.900> lined<00:04:05.170> up<00:04:06.239> and<00:04:07.239> then<00:04:07.599> I'm<00:04:08.019> going<00:04:08.470> to<00:04:08.709> put

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
them lined up and then I'm going to put

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.000 
them lined up and then I'm going to put
them<00:04:09.819> well<00:04:10.629> first<00:04:10.930> now<00:04:11.200> that<00:04:11.440> I've<00:04:11.560> relieved

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
them well first now that I've relieved

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.729 
them well first now that I've relieved
that<00:04:12.190> pressure<00:04:12.489> I'll<00:04:12.760> push<00:04:13.000> the<00:04:13.209> red<00:04:13.420> button

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
that pressure I'll push the red button

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.580 
that pressure I'll push the red button
and<00:04:14.739> I<00:04:14.829> won't<00:04:15.099> worry<00:04:15.340> about<00:04:15.430> soaking<00:04:16.590> myself

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
and I won't worry about soaking myself

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.729 
and I won't worry about soaking myself
and<00:04:17.949> the<00:04:18.100> entire<00:04:18.609> area<00:04:19.019> they<00:04:20.019> have<00:04:20.169> done<00:04:20.470> that

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
and the entire area they have done that

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.760 
and the entire area they have done that
the<00:04:21.190> gurgle<00:04:21.850> the<00:04:22.210> water<00:04:22.479> pressures<00:04:23.080> off<00:04:23.350> there

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
the gurgle the water pressures off there

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.879 
the gurgle the water pressures off there
I'll<00:04:24.310> put<00:04:24.639> the<00:04:24.760> wrenches<00:04:25.210> on<00:04:25.419> here<00:04:25.840> and<00:04:26.440> again

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
I'll put the wrenches on here and again

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.490 
I'll put the wrenches on here and again
using<00:04:27.190> this<00:04:27.550> big<00:04:27.820> pipe<00:04:28.210> I<00:04:28.539> get<00:04:29.020> more<00:04:29.229> leverage

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
using this big pipe I get more leverage

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.379 
using this big pipe I get more leverage
I<00:04:30.039> can<00:04:30.430> twist<00:04:32.280> maybe<00:04:33.280> it<00:04:33.550> help<00:04:33.760> if<00:04:33.910> I<00:04:34.030> want<00:04:34.270> the

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
I can twist maybe it help if I want the

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:38.700 
I can twist maybe it help if I want the
right<00:04:34.570> direction

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.140 

okay

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
okay

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.120 
okay
even<00:04:42.050> with<00:04:42.290> the<00:04:43.040> extra<00:04:43.280> leverage<00:04:43.880> of<00:04:44.240> the<00:04:44.360> pipe

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
even with the extra leverage of the pipe

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.300 
even with the extra leverage of the pipe
still<00:04:46.130> difficult<00:04:46.730> to<00:04:46.940> move<00:04:47.260> so<00:04:48.260> we<00:04:48.949> got<00:04:49.160> it

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
still difficult to move so we got it

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.159 
still difficult to move so we got it
broke<00:04:49.550> free<00:04:50.139> we'll<00:04:51.139> unscrew<00:04:51.380> it<00:04:52.930> take<00:04:53.930> the

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
broke free we'll unscrew it take the

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:57.010 
broke free we'll unscrew it take the
dirty<00:04:54.440> old<00:04:55.010> filter<00:04:55.430> out<00:04:55.790> it's<00:04:56.540> looking<00:04:56.870> very

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
dirty old filter out it's looking very

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.460 
dirty old filter out it's looking very
grey<00:04:57.590> as<00:04:58.010> a<00:04:58.280> matter<00:04:58.669> of<00:04:58.820> fact<00:04:59.120> you<00:05:00.050> can<00:05:00.169> dump

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
grey as a matter of fact you can dump

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.710 
grey as a matter of fact you can dump
the<00:05:00.620> water<00:05:00.800> right<00:05:01.220> into<00:05:01.490> the<00:05:01.760> floor<00:05:02.090> drain<00:05:02.419> of

for demonstration purposes I'll cut this

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.850 
for demonstration purposes I'll cut this
a<00:05:30.669> little<00:05:31.029> shorter<00:05:31.449> just<00:05:32.259> going<00:05:32.499> to<00:05:32.589> set<00:05:32.830> that

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
a little shorter just going to set that

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:07.720 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.150 

things<00:07:08.290> are<00:07:08.500> looking<00:07:08.860> good<00:07:09.010> so<00:07:09.370> far<00:07:09.840> until<00:07:10.840> we

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.160 
things are looking good so far until we

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.700 
things are looking good so far until we
quit<00:07:12.160> hearing<00:07:12.610> the<00:07:12.850> water<00:07:13.060> running<00:07:13.750> we'll

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:14.710 
quit hearing the water running we'll

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:17.490 
quit hearing the water running we'll
know<00:07:14.860> whether<00:07:15.130> it's<00:07:15.400> safe<00:07:15.670> or<00:07:15.910> not<00:07:16.030> so<00:07:16.660> it's

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:17.500 
know whether it's safe or not so it's

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.770 
know whether it's safe or not so it's
still<00:07:17.800> running<00:07:18.100> because<00:07:18.490> it's<00:07:18.880> replacing<00:07:19.390> the

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:19.780 
still running because it's replacing the

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.850 
still running because it's replacing the
water<00:07:19.990> that<00:07:20.470> we<00:07:20.650> put<00:07:20.890> in<00:07:21.850> the<00:07:22.710> that<00:07:23.710> we
