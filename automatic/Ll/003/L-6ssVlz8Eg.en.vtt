00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
going to be applied to the tanks however

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.950 
going to be applied to the tanks however
there<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.730> couple<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.210> important<00:00:51.600> changes

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
there is a couple of important changes

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.540 
there is a couple of important changes
with<00:00:52.110> these<00:00:52.230> terrors<00:00:52.559> when<00:00:52.980> they<00:00:53.160> die<00:00:53.340> they'll

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
with these terrors when they die they'll

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.310 
with these terrors when they die they'll
leave<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.730> patch<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.090> green<00:00:54.480> goo<00:00:54.780> on<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.989> ground

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
leave a patch of green goo on the ground

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.840 
leave a patch of green goo on the ground
now<00:00:55.770> these<00:00:55.949> puddles<00:00:56.160> won't<00:00:56.460> do<00:00:56.579> anything

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
now these puddles won't do anything

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.610 
now these puddles won't do anything
while<00:00:57.210> they're<00:00:57.360> active<00:00:57.510> but<00:00:58.109> after<00:00:58.410> 15

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
while they're active but after 15

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.410 
while they're active but after 15
seconds<00:00:59.250> or<00:00:59.370> so<00:00:59.550> they'll<00:00:59.760> just<00:00:59.789> spit<00:01:00.239> out<00:01:00.359> a

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
seconds or so they'll just spit out a

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.479 
seconds or so they'll just spit out a
fell<00:01:00.809> blood<00:01:01.050> globulin<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.129> bad<00:01:02.280> so

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
fell blood globulin and this is bad so

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.950 
fell blood globulin and this is bad so
you<00:01:02.579> do<00:01:02.730> not<00:01:02.879> want<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.300> happen<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.870> way

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
you do not want this to happen the way

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.450 
you do not want this to happen the way
that<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.199> counter<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.769> if<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:04.979> send<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.309> couple

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
that you counter it if you send a couple

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.399 
that you counter it if you send a couple
of<00:01:05.549> people<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.909> stand<00:01:06.150> inside<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.930> puddle<00:01:07.260> and

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
soak it up after a couple of seconds the

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.960 
soak it up after a couple of seconds the
