00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:10.970
 this issue talks about vegetables that have 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.309
 the production of different substances 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.599
 varying over time with the 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.900
 last year 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:21.949
 this is a question that addresses the system 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.989
 called chromatin heteroatom and the chromatin 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.269
 variation of gene expression with 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:28.939
 the lifetime of the individual 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:32.539
 as well when any individual 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.519
 is born if it already has its genome and 

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:35.149
 this genome will not change until its 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:37.129
 death 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.420
 unless a mutation occurs more than 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.390
 in general and does not change 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.059
 but the expression of proteins changes 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.550
 much with the passing of his life time 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.609
 So what is the key here? 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.350
 expression of changing seedlings 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.629
 of the genetic code 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.320
 Let's look at the affirmations here and get here. 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.579
 until the best response to variations 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.019
 qualitative and quantitative 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.670
 of the substances by these plants 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.190
 for a year 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.270
 are possible because the genetic material 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.070
 of the individual the letter speaks the following 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.740
 suffers constant combinations in order to 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.870
 adapt to the combination of the term 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.970
 is a term that refers to the 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.870
 event of a band joining the 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.360
 other this is a group recombination 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:25.280
 genomic and only a fertilization occurs 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.410
 in case the plant is passing here 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.870
 during his life he has no fertilization 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.960
 happening then he treats discarded the 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.640
 letter b changes over the year in 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.890
 different phases of life 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.540
 This is against what we put in the 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.700
 beginning of the question 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.620
 the organism can change its production 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.140
 of proteins without changing their material 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.740
 the letter b genetic goes against the 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.720
 people will discard lyrics and create new ones. 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.030
 genera for biosynthesis of the 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.980
 specific substances to create a new 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.990
 gender means to modify the material 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.070
 also goes against what we 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.380
 also can not be the letter of 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:06.200
 changes base sequence or 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.090
 mutations throughout the life of 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.510
 an individual the mutations are not 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.500
 happening all the time can happen more 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.830
 That's not what's going to bring about change. 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.680
 simple pressure of the protein soon 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.470
 answer was here O has Letria 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.480
 genes transcribed differently according to 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.480
 with every need of the individual
