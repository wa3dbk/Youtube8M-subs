00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
so if you get it so that will run and

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.830 
so if you get it so that will run and
tick<00:00:29.830> over<00:00:29.950> on<00:00:30.280> idle<00:00:31.200> that's<00:00:32.200> great<00:00:32.590> if<00:00:32.860> not

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
and the engines try to tick over

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:40.870 
and the engines try to tick over
just<00:01:14.560> push<00:01:14.740> the<00:01:14.860> choke<00:01:15.040> straight<00:01:15.430> in

and be clockwise from what it was and

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.469 
and be clockwise from what it was and
cut<00:02:08.950> out<00:02:09.099> so<00:02:09.250> it's<00:02:09.399> really<00:02:09.580> fine<00:02:09.849> adjustments

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.830 

might<00:02:42.720> need<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:43.049> little<00:02:43.260> adjustment

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:35.499 
because it just it's flooding the engine

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:37.709 
because it just it's flooding the engine
with<00:03:35.590> too<00:03:35.709> much<00:03:35.799> fuel<00:03:36.129> so<00:03:36.510> what<00:03:37.510> we're<00:03:37.599> going

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:37.719 
with too much fuel so what we're going

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:41.580 
with too much fuel so what we're going
to<00:03:37.749> do<00:03:37.900> is<00:03:38.079> the<00:03:39.069> higher<00:03:39.340> judgement<00:03:40.590> remember

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
it's all the way in

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.129 
it's all the way in
so<00:03:42.549> that's<00:03:42.790> clockwise<00:03:43.239> I'm<00:03:43.780> going<00:03:43.930> to<00:03:43.989> take

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.139 
so that's clockwise I'm going to take

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:50.280 
so that's clockwise I'm going to take
anti-clockwise<00:03:45.209> out<00:03:46.209> a<00:03:46.269> little<00:03:46.659> bit<00:03:49.290> that's

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
anti-clockwise out a little bit that's

00:03:50.290 --> 00:04:00.270 
anti-clockwise out a little bit that's
exactly<00:03:50.769> half<00:03:50.920> a<00:03:51.040> turn

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.350

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:05:29.980 

take<00:04:47.000> off<00:04:47.180> it

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.409 

okay<00:05:30.990> so<00:05:31.560> let's<00:05:32.039> go<00:05:32.280> on<00:05:32.310> put<00:05:32.819> the<00:05:32.940> full<00:05:33.120> speed

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
okay so let's go on put the full speed

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:34.850 
okay so let's go on put the full speed
back<00:05:33.750> down<00:05:33.960> without<00:05:34.169> cutting<00:05:34.440> out<00:05:34.590> and<00:05:34.740> also

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
back down without cutting out and also

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.490 
back down without cutting out and also
the<00:05:35.069> engine<00:05:35.310> is<00:05:35.400> not<00:05:35.630> bogging<00:05:36.630> down<00:05:36.660> some

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:43.969 
a little bit if it was me again just to
recap<00:05:42.930> I<00:05:43.289> would<00:05:43.410> start<00:05:43.650> with<00:05:43.710> the<00:05:43.830> law

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
recap I would start with the law

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:45.800 
recap I would start with the law
justement<00:05:44.490> just<00:05:45.210> until<00:05:45.449> you<00:05:45.509> can<00:05:45.630> get<00:05:45.690> it

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
justement just until you can get it

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.100 
justement just until you can get it
running<00:05:46.069> if<00:05:47.069> it<00:05:47.280> cuts<00:05:47.490> down<00:05:47.729> if<00:05:48.569> it<00:05:48.750> cuts<00:05:48.960> out

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
running if it cuts down if it cuts out

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.920 
running if it cuts down if it cuts out
so<00:05:49.289> when<00:05:49.470> you<00:05:49.530> put<00:05:49.680> any<00:05:49.830> throttle<00:05:50.190> on<00:05:50.780> push<00:05:51.780> the

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
so when you put any throttle on push the

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.170 
so when you put any throttle on push the
high<00:05:52.080> adjustment<00:05:52.560> all<00:05:52.710> the<00:05:52.919> way<00:05:53.009> in<00:05:53.069> and<00:05:54.060> then

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
high adjustment all the way in and then

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.360 
high adjustment all the way in and then
you<00:05:54.270> take<00:05:54.449> it<00:05:54.479> out<00:05:54.630> I<00:05:54.840> took<00:05:55.080> that<00:05:55.199> out<00:05:55.319> a<00:05:55.650> full

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
you take it out I took that out a full

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:02.330 
you take it out I took that out a full
turn<00:05:57.500> and<00:05:58.970> then<00:05:59.970> it<00:06:00.090> was<00:06:00.240> it<00:06:01.110> was<00:06:01.229> okay<00:06:01.560> but<00:06:02.280> I

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
turn and then it was it was okay but I

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.830 
turn and then it was it was okay but I
start<00:06:02.849> with<00:06:03.000> just<00:06:03.120> half<00:06:03.270> turns<00:06:03.539> and<00:06:03.750> then

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
start with just half turns and then

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.420 
start with just half turns and then
she's<00:06:03.990> a<00:06:04.050> tiny<00:06:04.259> bit<00:06:04.440> of<00:06:04.530> fine-tuning<00:06:04.770> just<00:06:05.340> to

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
she's a tiny bit of fine-tuning just to

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.550 
she's a tiny bit of fine-tuning just to
get<00:06:05.550> the<00:06:05.699> engine<00:06:06.240> so<00:06:06.419> on<00:06:06.479> and<00:06:06.630> right<00:06:06.780> that's

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
get the engine so on and right that's

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.020 
get the engine so on and right that's
just<00:06:07.650> basic<00:06:08.250> you<00:06:08.280> get<00:06:08.430> it<00:06:08.520> started

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
just basic you get it started

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.580 
just basic you get it started
if<00:06:10.020> you<00:06:10.110> haven't<00:06:10.349> all<00:06:10.500> right<00:06:11.160> chief
