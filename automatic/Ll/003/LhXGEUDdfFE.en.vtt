00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.690
 Anything can be done up-force, and the screen is big and easy to handle with ipad 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.800
 Also I'd get 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.800
 It's addicting and there's just one 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:23.510

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:25.220
 Is another recommended app to are wondering like to play in and out of the softening sound 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.160
 Software called Baresi version 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.650
 There is an app 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.640
 Apple 's sound 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.930
 When the Well no I'm such the same thing was garageband you are about the Mac 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:40.630
 Garage punk do is Kedomo of use say a lot I mean 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:42.520
 Even people who can handle it very easily and can not play the instrument at all 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.820
 It says that cool video can be made 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:50.740
 This is what this Variage Mand app will try to start any business 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:55.900
 Various Toka guitar it is Toka keyboard It is Toka-based ThatLookLikeThis 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:58.680
 The instruments came in and you can play by tapping each screen with your hand . 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.680
 Eg keyboard 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.240
 Such a key comes out when I tap 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.159
 I can feel like this 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:13.960
 I want you to pay attention 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:16.469
 I have worked a large adult velocity When you touch strongly slowly touches makes it small sound 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.469
 It is what the place 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:31.330
 The finger of acceleration appetizers finger of such in I'd might as well do a little confusing with the feeling 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:33.480
 Sense how much you hit it and how much you hit it 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.690
 It seems to be judging 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.760
 And there is another thing called scale 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:44.990
 For example this 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.990
 All take the 1 blues-ish and the other it is when you or to the scale of the loose 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:56.590
 It is that will appropriately play it is or rather songs of it like atmosphere even playing 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.390
 In of this 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.070
 If there are various proposals in other 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.820
 Well, for example, the drums are the same. 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.820
 Beat 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.850
 You can easily make three trains with your fingers 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.890
 I can not give you 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.630
 The rest is 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.770
 It's still a music fence light to some extent now 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:32.480

 I have instruments, but if it is this one, anyone 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.480
 I can play the right music, for example, I heard it 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.390
 To be 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.390
 First of all , you can do funeral fun with the camp with one finger 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.840
 It is the Deato 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.260
 There is a play and I really do this with this 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:12.270
 I will play it automatically if I tap it with Matsudo finger and change the code. 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.380
 That's why 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.940
 This is it 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.819
 I say notes 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.900
 This is different This is normal 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.900
 Specify the scale 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:29.620

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:49.390

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:54.909
 Even after this kind of feeling with the keyboard like this 4 how 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:58.600
 Although it is appropriate, let me play that and have it recorded on it and a guitar on it 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:04:01.000
 Make a song alone Professor to or overlapping the performance of 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:06.520
 I'm doing something somehow 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:10.780
 It may become surprisingly hot Since that time can make a song to be in and out mood 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.390
