Zillah orange they did it just for us by
the<00:00:35.790> way<00:00:35.969> as<00:00:36.120> well<00:00:36.630> as<00:00:36.780> yellow<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.230> there's

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
the way as well as yellow and there's

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.660 
the way as well as yellow and there's
one<00:00:37.530> more<00:00:37.680> color<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.160> mix<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.489> is

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
one more color in the mix that is

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.790 
one more color in the mix that is
escaping<00:00:39.030> me<00:00:39.270> at<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.960> moment<00:00:40.230> but<00:00:40.590> if<00:00:40.710> you

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
escaping me at this moment but if you

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.100 
escaping me at this moment but if you
look<00:00:41.010> at<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.700> reflectivity<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.690> almost

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
look at it the reflectivity and almost

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.959 
look at it the reflectivity and almost
the<00:00:43.230> electricity<00:00:43.890> kind<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.250> ties<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.760> nicely

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
the electricity kind of ties it nicely

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.880 
the electricity kind of ties it nicely
and<00:00:45.300> then<00:00:45.629> here<00:00:45.870> on<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.050> orange<00:00:46.440> graphic<00:00:46.800> and

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
and then here on the orange graphic and

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.979 
and then here on the orange graphic and
remember<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.820> main<00:00:48.059> substrate<00:00:48.600> graphic

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
remember it's the main substrate graphic

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.690 
remember it's the main substrate graphic
that<00:00:49.140> are<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.739> main<00:00:49.950> base<00:00:50.190> color<00:00:50.460> that's

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
that are the the main base color that's

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.459 
that are the the main base color that's
going<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.030> change<00:00:51.210> but<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.840> can<00:00:51.989> see<00:00:52.170> here<00:00:52.379> as

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
going to change but you can see here as

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.319 
going to change but you can see here as
I<00:00:52.559> flip<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:52.949> upside<00:00:53.250> down<00:00:53.280> how<00:00:53.879> everything

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
I flip it upside down how everything

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.600 
I flip it upside down how everything
sweeps<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.930> ties<00:00:55.260> together<00:00:55.559> now<00:00:56.190> one<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.460> the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
sweeps and ties together now one of the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.590 
sweeps and ties together now one of the
things<00:00:56.820> they've<00:00:56.969> done<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.270> year<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.570> I

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
things they've done this year that I

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.150 
things they've done this year that I
really<00:00:57.660> like<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.379> remember<00:00:58.649> it's<00:00:58.770> not<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.890> poly

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
really like and remember it's not a poly

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.770 
really like and remember it's not a poly

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.189 
if you're gonna buy one of these helmets
you<00:01:03.210> should<00:01:03.390> really<00:01:03.510> understand<00:01:03.930> what<00:01:04.080> you're

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
you should really understand what you're

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.630

call<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.340> orange<00:01:08.670> peel<00:01:08.880> because<00:01:09.000> when<00:01:09.180> you

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
call it orange peel because when you

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.399 
call it orange peel because when you
think<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.479> painting<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:09.960> bikes<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.380> cars

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
think of painting on bikes and cars

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.010 
think of painting on bikes and cars
that's<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.250> negative<00:01:11.729> but<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.330> has<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.600> slight

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
that's a negative but it has a slight

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.899 
that's a negative but it has a slight
texture<00:01:13.470> it's<00:01:13.590> almost<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.040> way<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.280> decal<00:01:14.700> is

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
texture it's almost the way the decal is

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.260 
texture it's almost the way the decal is
worked<00:01:15.299> into<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.630> graphic<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.500> can<00:01:16.530> feel

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
worked into this graphic you can feel

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.690 
worked into this graphic you can feel
though<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.630> can<00:01:18.810> feel<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.830> outer<00:01:20.100> shell

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
though you can feel the outer shell

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.280 
though you can feel the outer shell
underneath<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.600> think<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.930> adds<00:01:22.110> a

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
underneath it and I think that adds a

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.280 
underneath it and I think that adds a
really<00:01:22.680> really<00:01:23.009> interesting<00:01:23.220> touch<00:01:24.290> noticing

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
really really interesting touch noticing

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.840 
really really interesting touch noticing
how<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.409> reflectivity<00:01:25.920> plays<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.520> both<00:01:26.700> at

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
how the reflectivity plays in both at

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.700 
how the reflectivity plays in both at
the<00:01:26.939> front<00:01:27.060> as<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.689> sweeps<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.170> back<00:01:28.350> as<00:01:28.560> I

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
the front as it sweeps to the back as I

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.039 
the front as it sweeps to the back as I
move<00:01:28.920> my<00:01:29.100> way<00:01:29.310> towards<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.820> spoiler<00:01:30.210> now

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049
