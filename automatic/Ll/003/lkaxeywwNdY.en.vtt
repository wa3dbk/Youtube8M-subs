00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
reviewed the kindle app before and it

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.330 
reviewed the kindle app before and it

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
I mean the app came up just fine but

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.069 
I mean the app came up just fine but
when<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.399> try<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.820> actually<00:01:00.210> read<00:01:00.719> something

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
when you try to actually read something

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.520 
when you try to actually read something

which is what the f was for it just it

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.649

read it over the summer he's actually
gotten<00:01:22.350> into<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:22.799> think<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:23.100> little<00:01:23.250> bit<00:01:24.020> well

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
gotten into it I think a little bit well

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.260 
gotten into it I think a little bit well
I'm<00:01:25.170> but<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.640> really<00:01:26.790> cool<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.119> has<00:01:27.240> a

I'm but this is really cool it has a

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.319 
I'm but this is really cool it has a
sliding<00:01:27.689> indicator<00:01:28.290> on<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.500> bottom<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.329> think

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
sliding indicator on the bottom I think

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.210

if<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.570> hit<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.780> menu<00:01:30.990> buttons<00:01:31.409> when<00:01:32.100> it

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
if you hit the menu buttons when it

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.660 
if you hit the menu buttons when it
comes<00:01:32.430> up<00:01:33.829> well<00:01:34.829> anyway<00:01:35.130> when<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.430> first

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:47.419 
so long to get this nook app in the

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:50.289 
so long to get this nook app in the
android<00:02:47.599> store<00:02:48.049> because<00:02:48.650> isn't<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:49.099> nook<00:02:49.310> an

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
android store because isn't the nook an

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.929 
android store because isn't the nook an
android<00:02:50.689> device<00:02:50.720> yeah<00:02:51.680> i<00:02:51.980> think<00:02:52.340> that<00:02:52.730> they

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:52.939 
android device yeah i think that they

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:55.420 
android device yeah i think that they
hadn't<00:02:53.810> decided<00:02:54.290> exactly<00:02:54.680> what<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.310> heck

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
hadn't decided exactly what the heck

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.909 
hadn't decided exactly what the heck
they<00:02:55.639> wanted<00:02:56.000> to<00:02:56.150> do<00:02:56.530> you<00:02:57.530> know<00:02:57.650> if<00:02:57.739> they<00:02:57.859> were

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:57.919 
they wanted to do you know if they were

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:00.520 
they wanted to do you know if they were
going<00:02:58.159> to<00:02:58.189> just<00:02:58.459> release<00:02:58.790> an<00:02:59.090> app<00:02:59.900> for<00:03:00.469> the

going to just release an app for the

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.209 
going to just release an app for the

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
just released a device that runs android

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.670

or actually release a standalone app for
android<00:03:10.099> too<00:03:10.370> because<00:03:11.180> that<00:03:11.329> exposes<00:03:11.959> them

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
android too because that exposes them

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.979 
android too because that exposes them
you<00:03:12.980> know<00:03:13.099> to<00:03:13.129> possibly<00:03:13.879> reducing<00:03:14.810> their

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
you know to possibly reducing their

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.890 
you know to possibly reducing their
hardware<00:03:15.379> sales<00:03:16.090> so<00:03:17.090> that's<00:03:17.449> the<00:03:17.629> kind<00:03:17.840> of

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
hardware sales so that's the kind of

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.210 
hardware sales so that's the kind of
conflict<00:03:18.260> you<00:03:18.470> go<00:03:18.590> through<00:03:18.799> when<00:03:18.889> you<00:03:19.010> have<00:03:19.190> a

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
some of it locally like cash isn't

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.219 
some of it locally like cash isn't
encrypted<00:03:45.879> but<00:03:46.879> yet<00:03:47.329> pulls<00:03:47.599> it<00:03:47.720> all<00:03:47.840> off<00:03:48.049> the

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:48.229 
encrypted but yet pulls it all off the

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:51.610 
encrypted but yet pulls it all off the
server<00:03:48.500> oh<00:03:49.239> so<00:03:50.239> um<00:03:50.720> if<00:03:51.290> you<00:03:51.379> have<00:03:51.470> no

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
connection then you got no nookie that's

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.309 
connection then you got no nookie that's
yeah<00:03:54.409> pretty<00:03:54.979> much<00:03:55.069> I<00:03:55.699> think<00:03:56.599> it<00:03:56.720> does<00:03:56.900> it<00:03:57.139> I

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
yeah pretty much I think it does it I

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.979 
yeah pretty much I think it does it I
think<00:03:57.530> it<00:03:57.620> holds<00:03:57.739> quite<00:03:58.009> a<00:03:58.069> bit<00:03:58.280> on<00:03:58.310> here<00:03:58.989> isn't

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
think it holds quite a bit on here isn't

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.780 
think it holds quite a bit on here isn't
that<00:04:00.019> always<00:04:00.199> how<00:04:00.319> life<00:04:00.470> it's<00:04:01.099> probably<00:04:01.519> like

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
that always how life it's probably like

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.879 
that always how life it's probably like
a<00:04:01.819> download<00:04:02.299> thing<00:04:02.569> to<00:04:02.810> where<00:04:03.319> is<00:04:03.470> it<00:04:03.650> only

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:03.889 
a download thing to where is it only

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:07.270 
a download thing to where is it only
downloads<00:04:04.430> so<00:04:04.699> much<00:04:04.909> yeah<00:04:05.479> but<00:04:06.229> it<00:04:07.159> doesn't
