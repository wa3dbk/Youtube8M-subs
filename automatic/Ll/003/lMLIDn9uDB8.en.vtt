 August when the last one was canceled 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.030
 redoubt of support for migrants in 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.379
 tultitlán with the removal of a tent 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.629
 provisional that had been installed 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.760
 under a bridge after closure 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.799
 problems with some neighbors of the house 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.220
 of the migrant san juan diego who operated in 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:07.350
 the area for three years the same carp was 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.330
 moved to a hectare of land to 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.270
 the outskirts of the neighborhood san bartolo in 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.640
 huehuetoca this camp where the 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.039
 people can stay two days without 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.200
 possibility of leaving is handled by the 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:21.270
 diocese of cuautitlán but in 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.039
 huehuetoca a kilometer and a half from 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.039
 distance there is another hostel 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.939
 presents us the same 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.939
 look 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.210
 the sanjosé hostel works in a 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.920
 independent with the support of 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.470
 organizations like migrant movement 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.060
 Mesoamerican you are us and 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.649
 the Iberoamerican university 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.259
 and let's say we have dynamics 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:54.930
 different to work but for example 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:56.450
 the doctor is already for minor things or 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.360
 when they have 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.799
 to behave we sent them here 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.659
 you can stay three days as in 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.640
 any immigrant's house 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.289
 can enter and exit at the moment 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.780
 want until 10 o'clock at night 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:12.299
 we close the door and although the rules 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.730
 They are very clear explains Andrea Gonzalez 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.080
 one of the hostel coordinators did not 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.010
 they are exempt from facing situations 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.010
 difficult 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.230
 because we are taking and we are all 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.230
 suddenly no way 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.860
 to ingest any type of drug is not 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.560
 can do any kind of negotiation 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.190
 here because about immigration 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.050
 there is a whole network of people trafficking 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.209
 the hostel san josé is located in a 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.000
 land of about 800 square meters 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.090
 whose income amounts to 3 thousand pesos at 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.090
 month 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.569
 several parts are pasted these maps 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.719
 that indicate the routes 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:03.060
 migrants can take to usa 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:05.099
 there is a kitchen bathroom and two rooms that 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.840
 are insufficient, so in the 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.030
 In the patio , tarpaulins were installed so 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.489
 migrants can sleep during their 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.019
 stay themselves bring their hand of 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.170
 work to improve the conditions of 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.629
 place here everything is voluntary I 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.139
 I am a volunteer has been here 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:25.980
 will year the sprinkler will raise garbage 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:28.319
 support the kitchen where support post 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.720
 marisol lopez arrived from in that with the 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:33.930
 trunk full of food and we brought them 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:39.019
 some rice already cooked water 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.019
 bottled toilet paper tuna 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.200
 it's more than anything it moves me to see the 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.460
 news and look at all these people that that 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.450
 you look 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:50.050
 I worked more 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.720
 for fernando ramón and josué of 22 18 and 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.300
 19 years to reach this point almost to the 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.340
 half of his way is a whole 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.650
 feat just entering territory 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.319
 mexican in tenosique in tabasco were 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.880
 assaulted but his biggest fear and also 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.790
 that of their mothers when they were fired 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.450
 in san pedro sula honduras is another 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:12.680
 the grip in extortion 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.680
 but family 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.380
 they warned their moms so they 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.970
 worried I understand why so many 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.510
 things that talk about the zetas of your see 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.340
 so 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.460
 something like that but we're going to 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.930
 up to see what god says to 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.480
 andreas, member of the organization 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.880
 you are us and academic of the 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.280
 unam the hostel san jose is just a 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.860
 palliative that does not replace the need 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.090
 a house of the migrant in tultitlan what 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.240
 which are the realities that people do not 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.490
 will stop emigrating or are you put them 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.480
 harder the way and they will suffer more 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.480
 but they are not going to stop 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.610
 the day of the state in a hotel 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.140
