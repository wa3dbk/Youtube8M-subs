robots<00:00:06.120> using<00:00:06.540> Derby<00:00:07.020> we<00:00:07.859> will<00:00:08.010> use<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.220> tree

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
robots using Derby we will use the tree

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.370 
robots using Derby we will use the tree
bot<00:00:08.760> model<00:00:08.940> which<00:00:09.420> is<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.719> default<00:00:09.870> model

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
that irby loads from the tree but not

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.049 
that irby loads from the tree but not

any file feel free to i did this file to

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.820 
any file feel free to i did this file to
adapt<00:00:15.540> it<00:00:15.690> for<00:00:15.719> your<00:00:15.960> particular<00:00:16.289> robot

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
adapt it for your particular robot

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.849 
adapt it for your particular robot
configuration<00:00:17.720> this<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.080> ER<00:00:19.109> be<00:00:19.410> console

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
configuration this is the ER be console

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.460 
configuration this is the ER be console
and<00:00:20.160> this<00:00:21.090> is<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.359> tree<00:00:21.570> but<00:00:21.689> robot<00:00:22.050> that<00:00:22.289> we

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
and this is the tree but robot that we

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.609 
and this is the tree but robot that we
are<00:00:22.529> going<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.830> control<00:00:23.630> first<00:00:24.630> let's<00:00:25.199> connect

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
are going to control first let's connect

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.009 
are going to control first let's connect
to<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.859> robot<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.310> make<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.730> move<00:00:26.910> we<00:00:27.900> have

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
to the robot and make it move we have

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.759 
to the robot and make it move we have
two<00:00:28.199> wheels<00:00:28.500> name<00:00:29.130> we<00:00:29.609> are<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.179> will<00:00:30.630> L<00:00:30.900> which

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
two wheels name we are and will L which

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.950 
two wheels name we are and will L which
are<00:00:32.009> audiences<00:00:32.489> for<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.059> speed<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:33.600> let's

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
are audiences for the speed so let's

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.130 
are audiences for the speed so let's
assign<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.350> speed<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:35.120> 50<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.480> left<00:00:36.809> wheel

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
assign a speed of 50 to the left wheel

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.090 
assign a speed of 50 to the left wheel
first<00:00:37.800> this<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.550> not<00:00:38.730> like<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.739> the<00:00:40.739> robot

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
first this is not like that the robot

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.639 
first this is not like that the robot
will<00:00:42.030> start<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.420> turn<00:00:42.600> around<00:00:42.960> on<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.440> right

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
will start to turn around on the right

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.330 
will start to turn around on the right
the<00:00:43.920> right<00:00:44.190> wheel<00:00:44.700> does<00:00:45.000> not<00:00:45.210> mean<00:00:46.100> so<00:00:47.100> let's

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
the right wheel does not mean so let's

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.450 
the right wheel does not mean so let's
make<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.579> move<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.750> opposite<00:00:49.140> direction

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
make it move in the opposite direction

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.150 
make it move in the opposite direction
as<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.670> guess<00:00:50.850> it's<00:00:51.120> easy<00:00:51.360> with<00:00:51.899> our<00:00:52.230> equals

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
as you guess it's easy with our equals

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.779 
as you guess it's easy with our equals
minutes<00:00:53.579> 15<00:00:54.379> and<00:00:55.379> robot<00:00:55.890> starts<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.399> turn<00:00:56.579> on

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
minutes 15 and robot starts to turn on

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.830 
minutes 15 and robot starts to turn on
itself<00:00:57.980> now<00:00:58.980> how<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.190> stop<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.579> well<00:01:00.449> we<00:01:00.600> just

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
itself now how to stop it well we just

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.709 
itself now how to stop it well we just
have<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.199> set<00:01:01.379> both<00:01:01.649> wheels<00:01:02.010> speed<00:01:02.910> 20<00:01:03.359> which

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
have to set both wheels speed 20 which

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.080 
have to set both wheels speed 20 which
is<00:01:03.750> done<00:01:04.140> with<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.500> wheel<00:01:04.710> group<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.790> can<00:01:05.939> be

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
is done with the wheel group that can be

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.820 
is done with the wheel group that can be
used<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.390> assign<00:01:06.600> both<00:01:06.840> winners<00:01:07.170> at<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.530> same

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
used to assign both winners at the same

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.969 
used to assign both winners at the same
time<00:01:08.450> how<00:01:09.450> can<00:01:09.659> we<00:01:09.780> move<00:01:09.900> straight<00:01:10.170> what<00:01:10.830> would

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
time how can we move straight what would

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.679 
time how can we move straight what would
just<00:01:11.189> assign<00:01:11.460> both<00:01:11.670> wheels<00:01:12.030> with<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.479> same

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
just assign both wheels with the same

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.620 
just assign both wheels with the same
speed<00:01:13.100> it's<00:01:14.100> also<00:01:14.280> wait<00:01:14.640> for<00:01:14.850> one<00:01:15.000> second<00:01:15.479> and

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
speed it's also wait for one second and

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.429 
speed it's also wait for one second and
then<00:01:16.350> stop<00:01:16.710> for<00:01:17.220> assigning<00:01:17.549> 0<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.200> wheels

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
then stop for assigning 0 to the wheels

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.749 
then stop for assigning 0 to the wheels
again<00:01:20.720> very<00:01:21.720> simple<00:01:22.100> you<00:01:23.100> can<00:01:23.220> imagine<00:01:23.430> now

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
again very simple you can imagine now

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.880 
again very simple you can imagine now
how<00:01:23.939> is<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.420> can<00:01:24.630> start<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.170> move<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.770> do

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
how is it you can start to move and do

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.039 
how is it you can start to move and do
curved<00:01:26.250> trajectories<00:01:27.090> by<00:01:27.360> having<00:01:27.720> different

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
curved trajectories by having different

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.219 
curved trajectories by having different
speeds<00:01:28.380> on<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.650> two<00:01:28.890> wheels<00:01:29.810> if<00:01:30.810> you've<00:01:30.990> seen

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
speeds on the two wheels if you've seen

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.080 
speeds on the two wheels if you've seen
the<00:01:31.409> model<00:01:31.710> tutorial<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.369> know<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.909> can

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
the model tutorial you know that you can

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.149 
the model tutorial you know that you can
do<00:01:33.270> more<00:01:33.540> like<00:01:33.840> for<00:01:34.079> example<00:01:34.170> controlling<00:01:35.009> the

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
do more like for example controlling the

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.609 
do more like for example controlling the
acceleration<00:01:35.939> by<00:01:36.240> specifying<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:37.020> time<00:01:37.350> to

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
acceleration by specifying a time to

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.789 
acceleration by specifying a time to
reach<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:38.070> given<00:01:38.520> video<00:01:39.079> like<00:01:40.079> here<00:01:40.380> twist

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
reach a given video like here twist

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.160 
reach a given video like here twist
against<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.369> which<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.729> video<00:01:41.880> 50<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.600> then

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
against to which the video 50 and then

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:52.940 
against to which the video 50 and then
again<00:01:43.470> three<00:01:43.710> seconds<00:01:44.240> to<00:01:45.240> go<00:01:45.390> back<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.780> zero

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.090 

that's<00:01:53.950> Google<00:01:54.870> now<00:01:55.870> you<00:01:56.560> can<00:01:56.770> do<00:01:56.890> more<00:01:57.070> than

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
that's Google now you can do more than

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.160 
that's Google now you can do more than
motor<00:01:57.460> control<00:01:57.970> with<00:01:58.180> the<00:01:58.300> tree<00:01:58.480> but<00:01:58.660> you<00:01:59.020> can

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
motor control with the tree but you can

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.920 
motor control with the tree but you can
also<00:01:59.350> access<00:01:59.590> sensors<00:02:00.430> like<00:02:00.760> for<00:02:01.000> example<00:02:01.090> 2

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
also access sensors like for example 2

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.620 
also access sensors like for example 2
so<00:02:02.170> now<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:03.340> get<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:03.610> value<00:02:03.910> of<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.210> sonar

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
so now to get the value of the sonar

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.520 
so now to get the value of the sonar
just<00:02:05.140> evaluated<00:02:06.010> in<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:06.250> console<00:02:07.229> here<00:02:08.229> it

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
just evaluated in the console here it

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.190

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:43.790 
Arabic was also a beeper the beginning
of<00:05:37.710> the<00:05:37.860> movement<00:05:38.250> as<00:05:38.400> expected<00:05:42.530> ok<00:05:43.530> let's

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
of the movement as expected ok let's

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.040 
of the movement as expected ok let's
stop<00:05:44.130> it<00:05:44.280> now<00:05:44.490> stop<00:05:45.180> no<00:05:45.360> tag<00:05:45.690> and<00:05:47.720> then<00:05:48.720> put

to<00:06:22.680> put<00:06:22.860> the<00:06:23.009> code<00:06:23.750> you<00:06:24.750> will<00:06:24.900> set<00:06:25.110> the<00:06:25.259> speed

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 
to put the code you will set the speed

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.409 
to put the code you will set the speed
wait<00:06:28.080> for<00:06:28.379> the<00:06:28.469> time<00:06:28.710> given<00:06:29.340> in<00:06:29.639> the<00:06:29.849> timer

wait for the time given in the timer
permitir<00:06:34.250> and<00:06:35.960> then<00:06:36.960> we<00:06:37.770> stop<00:06:38.039> by<00:06:38.849> putting<00:06:39.270> the

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 
permitir and then we stop by putting the

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:44.570 
permitir and then we stop by putting the
wheels<00:06:40.229> speed<00:06:41.129> to<00:06:41.310> zero<00:06:42.139> that's<00:06:43.139> it<00:06:43.379> now<00:06:43.650> let's

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 
wheels speed to zero that's it now let's

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.790 
wheels speed to zero that's it now let's
try<00:06:44.789> this<00:06:44.849> function<00:06:45.449> from<00:06:46.080> now<00:06:46.259> on<00:06:46.469> you<00:06:46.590> can

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 
try this function from now on you can

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.920 
try this function from now on you can
use<00:06:46.949> it<00:06:46.979> anywhere<00:06:47.430> in<00:06:47.729> your<00:06:47.819> program<00:06:48.270> we

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:48.930 
use it anywhere in your program we

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:50.510 
use it anywhere in your program we
simply<00:06:49.289> call<00:06:49.500> it<00:06:49.650> with<00:06:49.889> a<00:06:49.919> set<00:06:50.159> of<00:06:50.279> parameters

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 
simply call it with a set of parameters

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.179 
simply call it with a set of parameters
I<00:06:51.060> can<00:06:51.659> move<00:06:51.930> three<00:06:52.229> seconds<00:06:52.710> with<00:06:52.860> a<00:06:52.889> speed<00:06:53.159> of
