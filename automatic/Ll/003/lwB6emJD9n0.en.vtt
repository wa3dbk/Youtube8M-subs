really insure that the edges are all
coming<00:01:41.759> out<00:01:42.950> sometimes<00:01:43.950> they'll<00:01:44.100> stick<00:01:44.460> in

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
coming out sometimes they'll stick in

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.910 
coming out sometimes they'll stick in

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
the corners so go ahead and use the end

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.350 
the corners so go ahead and use the end
of<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.100> spatula<00:01:47.310> or<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.850> tip<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.149> knife<00:01:48.299> or

with an intricate cutter you could
certainly<00:02:15.910> do<00:02:16.239> the<00:02:16.420> old<00:02:16.569> classic<00:02:17.220> gingerbread

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.490 

and<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.629> other<00:02:28.750> thing<00:02:28.959> that<00:02:28.989> will<00:02:29.140> help<00:02:29.349> you

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
and the other thing that will help you

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.470 
and the other thing that will help you
really<00:02:30.430> make<00:02:30.610> sure<00:02:30.640> these<00:02:30.879> cookies<00:02:31.239> come<00:02:31.450> out

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
really make sure these cookies come out

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.160 
really make sure these cookies come out
in<00:02:31.900> one<00:02:32.470> piece<00:02:32.709> and<00:02:33.129> not<00:02:34.060> be<00:02:34.690> too<00:02:34.870> much<00:02:34.989> of<00:02:35.049> a

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
in one piece and not be too much of a

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.990 
in one piece and not be too much of a
nightmare<00:02:35.500> to<00:02:35.650> handle<00:02:36.010> is<00:02:36.160> you<00:02:36.700> want<00:02:36.849> to<00:02:36.910> make

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
nightmare to handle is you want to make

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.100 
nightmare to handle is you want to make
sure<00:02:37.030> that<00:02:37.239> the<00:02:37.330> dough<00:02:37.450> itself<00:02:37.840> is<00:02:37.989> actually

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
sure that the dough itself is actually

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.400 
sure that the dough itself is actually
just<00:02:38.650> chilled<00:02:39.040> well<00:02:39.250> enough<00:02:40.080> if<00:02:41.080> it's<00:02:41.200> too

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
just chilled well enough if it's too

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.559 
just chilled well enough if it's too
soft<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:42.190> really<00:02:42.610> will<00:02:42.730> be<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:42.879> bear<00:02:43.120> to<00:02:43.239> handle

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
soft it really will be a bear to handle

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.809 
soft it really will be a bear to handle
so<00:02:43.799> it's<00:02:44.799> it's<00:02:45.099> definitely<00:02:45.250> important<00:02:45.760> to

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
so it's it's definitely important to

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.470 
so it's it's definitely important to
chill<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.150> dough<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:48.430> so<00:02:48.849> again<00:02:49.090> we<00:02:49.209> can<00:02:49.329> go

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
chill the dough and so again we can go

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.660 
chill the dough and so again we can go
ahead<00:02:49.569> and<00:02:49.780> reroll<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.319> scraps<00:02:52.769> and<00:02:53.769> as<00:02:54.519> you

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
ahead and reroll the scraps and as you

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.850 
ahead and reroll the scraps and as you
see<00:02:54.819> the<00:02:54.970> size<00:02:55.180> of<00:02:55.360> the<00:02:55.450> cutter<00:02:55.660> will<00:02:55.860> clearly

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
see the size of the cutter will clearly

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.619 
see the size of the cutter will clearly
dictate<00:02:57.280> how<00:02:57.370> many<00:02:57.519> cookies<00:02:57.849> you<00:02:57.940> get<00:02:58.060> the

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
dictate how many cookies you get the

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:00.030 
dictate how many cookies you get the
snowflake<00:02:59.049> we've<00:02:59.230> chosen<00:02:59.500> is<00:02:59.709> a<00:02:59.739> bit<00:02:59.890> of<00:02:59.980> a

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
snowflake we've chosen is a bit of a

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:13.710 
snowflake we've chosen is a bit of a
larger<00:03:00.340> shape<00:03:11.849> and<00:03:12.849> it<00:03:12.970> is<00:03:13.030> important<00:03:13.510> to<00:03:13.540> make

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
larger shape and it is important to make

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.839 
larger shape and it is important to make
sure<00:03:13.930> that<00:03:14.200> all<00:03:14.560> of<00:03:14.799> your<00:03:14.920> cookies<00:03:15.250> are<00:03:15.370> about

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
sure that all of your cookies are about

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.210 
sure that all of your cookies are about
the<00:03:16.000> same<00:03:16.209> thickness<00:03:16.769> because<00:03:17.769> if<00:03:17.889> you<00:03:17.980> if

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
the same thickness because if you if

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.440 
the same thickness because if you if
you've<00:03:18.370> got<00:03:18.400> some<00:03:18.730> cookies<00:03:19.000> that<00:03:19.060> are<00:03:19.180> rolled

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
you've got some cookies that are rolled

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.849 
you've got some cookies that are rolled
too<00:03:19.630> thin<00:03:19.870> and<00:03:20.109> some<00:03:20.260> that<00:03:20.410> are<00:03:20.530> rolled<00:03:20.680> too

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
too thin and some that are rolled too

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:22.890 
too thin and some that are rolled too
thick<00:03:21.130> they<00:03:21.790> bake<00:03:22.030> differently<00:03:22.510> so<00:03:22.780> you'll

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
thick they bake differently so you'll

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.930 
thick they bake differently so you'll
have<00:03:22.989> some<00:03:23.230> cookies<00:03:23.500> that<00:03:23.560> are<00:03:23.829> you<00:03:24.819> know

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
have some cookies that are you know

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.670 
have some cookies that are you know
somewhat<00:03:25.209> raw<00:03:25.450> in<00:03:25.600> the<00:03:25.720> center<00:03:26.049> and<00:03:26.290> some<00:03:26.530> that

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
somewhat raw in the center and some that

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.750 
somewhat raw in the center and some that
are<00:03:26.769> just<00:03:26.799> baked<00:03:27.100> too<00:03:27.250> hard<00:03:29.400> so<00:03:30.400> just<00:03:30.639> be<00:03:30.730> aware

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
are just baked too hard so just be aware

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.150 
are just baked too hard so just be aware
of<00:03:31.000> that<00:03:31.319> and<00:03:32.319> they're<00:03:32.470> ready<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:32.680> go<00:03:32.829> into<00:03:33.069> the

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
of that and they're ready to go into the

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.580 
of that and they're ready to go into the
oven<00:03:33.280> which<00:03:33.579> is<00:03:33.609> preheated<00:03:33.760> to<00:03:34.209> about<00:03:34.480> 350<00:03:35.049> and

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
oven which is preheated to about 350 and

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.270 
oven which is preheated to about 350 and
they're<00:03:36.220> gonna<00:03:36.310> bake<00:03:36.609> for<00:03:37.420> about<00:03:37.950> 10<00:03:38.950> to<00:03:39.069> 12

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
they're gonna bake for about 10 to 12

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.870 
they're gonna bake for about 10 to 12
minutes

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
minutes

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.819 
minutes
if<00:03:39.940> you've<00:03:40.480> rolled<00:03:40.720> them<00:03:40.900> relatively<00:03:41.410> thin<00:03:41.680> as

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
if you've rolled them relatively thin as

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.440 
if you've rolled them relatively thin as
we<00:03:41.889> have<00:03:42.130> here<00:03:42.400> 10<00:03:42.700> to<00:03:42.790> 12<00:03:43.000> minutes<00:03:43.120> should<00:03:43.389> be

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
we have here 10 to 12 minutes should be

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:44.280 
we have here 10 to 12 minutes should be
just<00:03:43.840> fine

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
just fine

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.740 
just fine
again<00:03:44.769> because<00:03:45.099> this<00:03:45.370> particular<00:03:45.910> cookie<00:03:46.419> is

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
again because this particular cookie is

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.199 
again because this particular cookie is
dark<00:03:47.410> in<00:03:47.530> color<00:03:47.799> it's<00:03:48.370> gonna<00:03:48.489> be<00:03:48.700> a<00:03:48.730> little<00:03:49.090> bit

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
dark in color it's gonna be a little bit

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.150 
dark in color it's gonna be a little bit
tricky<00:03:49.630> to<00:03:49.660> determine<00:03:50.319> when<00:03:50.530> they're<00:03:50.709> done<00:03:50.829> so

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
tricky to determine when they're done so

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.409 
tricky to determine when they're done so
it's<00:03:51.310> important<00:03:51.639> that<00:03:51.669> you<00:03:51.819> go<00:03:51.940> into<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.209> oven

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:52.419 
it's important that you go into the oven

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:55.440 
it's important that you go into the oven
after<00:03:53.230> 8<00:03:53.739> to<00:03:53.919> 10<00:03:54.130> minutes<00:03:54.280> or<00:03:54.489> so<00:03:54.549> and<00:03:54.910> sort<00:03:55.389> of

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
after 8 to 10 minutes or so and sort of

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.360 
after 8 to 10 minutes or so and sort of
poke<00:03:56.079> around<00:03:56.230> and<00:03:56.530> and<00:03:56.709> see<00:03:57.099> how<00:03:57.220> they're

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
poke around and and see how they're

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.680 
poke around and and see how they're
coming<00:03:57.489> along<00:03:57.669> you<00:03:57.970> want<00:03:58.120> them<00:03:58.239> to<00:03:58.329> be<00:03:58.450> firm<00:03:58.660> to

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
coming along you want them to be firm to

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.589 
coming along you want them to be firm to
the<00:03:58.840> touch<00:03:58.930> and<00:03:59.290> spring<00:03:59.590> back<00:04:00.239> so<00:04:01.239> into<00:04:01.510> the

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
the touch and spring back so into the

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.580 
the touch and spring back so into the
oven<00:04:01.630> they<00:04:01.870> go<00:04:03.450> so<00:04:04.450> now<00:04:04.840> that<00:04:04.900> our<00:04:05.169> gingerbread

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
oven they go so now that our gingerbread

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.339 
oven they go so now that our gingerbread
dough<00:04:05.919> has<00:04:06.340> been<00:04:06.579> baked<00:04:06.910> into<00:04:07.359> snowflakes

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
dough has been baked into snowflakes

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:10.559 
dough has been baked into snowflakes
which<00:04:08.950> are<00:04:09.130> beautiful<00:04:10.000> and<00:04:10.150> they've<00:04:10.239> cooled

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
which are beautiful and they've cooled

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.809 
which are beautiful and they've cooled
we're<00:04:11.530> gonna<00:04:11.620> go<00:04:11.829> ahead<00:04:11.950> and<00:04:12.069> take<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.579> royal

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
we're gonna go ahead and take the royal

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.920 
we're gonna go ahead and take the royal
icing<00:04:13.060> that<00:04:13.329> we<00:04:13.510> made<00:04:13.660> earlier<00:04:14.190> put<00:04:15.190> it<00:04:15.280> into<00:04:15.669> a

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
icing that we made earlier put it into a

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.199 
icing that we made earlier put it into a
parchment<00:04:16.930> cone<00:04:17.590> so<00:04:18.340> we've<00:04:18.489> cut<00:04:18.729> a<00:04:18.760> long

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
parchment cone so we've cut a long

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.390 
parchment cone so we've cut a long
triangle<00:04:19.690> out<00:04:19.930> of<00:04:20.079> parchment<00:04:20.470> paper<00:04:20.530> and<00:04:21.010> then

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
triangle out of parchment paper and then

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.940 
triangle out of parchment paper and then
round<00:04:21.640> it<00:04:21.789> into<00:04:22.090> a<00:04:22.150> cone<00:04:22.650> filled<00:04:23.650> it<00:04:23.770> with<00:04:23.860> the

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
round it into a cone filled it with the

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.350 
round it into a cone filled it with the
royal<00:04:24.130> icing<00:04:24.280> and<00:04:24.550> then<00:04:24.700> cut<00:04:24.849> a<00:04:24.880> very<00:04:25.090> very

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
royal icing and then cut a very very

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.550 
royal icing and then cut a very very
small<00:04:25.719> fine<00:04:26.110> tip

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560

you've finished decorating your
gingerbread<00:05:30.430> snowflakes<00:05:31.090> and<00:05:31.560> then<00:05:32.560> topping

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
gingerbread snowflakes and then topping

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.700

them with the sanding sugar you want to

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.100 
them with the sanding sugar you want to
let<00:05:35.860> them<00:05:35.979> sit<00:05:36.010> for<00:05:36.700> at<00:05:37.360> least<00:05:37.570> a<00:05:37.780> few<00:05:37.960> hours

let them sit for at least a few hours

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.840 
let them sit for at least a few hours
it's<00:05:38.500> really<00:05:38.710> preferable<00:05:39.160> to<00:05:39.220> let<00:05:39.460> them<00:05:39.550> sit

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
it's really preferable to let them sit

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.120 
it's really preferable to let them sit
overnight<00:05:40.390> and<00:05:40.810> the<00:05:40.990> icing<00:05:41.350> will<00:05:41.380> really<00:05:41.860> firm

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
overnight and the icing will really firm

overnight and the icing will really firm
up<00:05:42.300> and<00:05:43.300> dry<00:05:43.930> nicely<00:05:46.020> and<00:05:47.020> again<00:05:47.320> these<00:05:47.500> really

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
up and dry nicely and again these really

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.430 
up and dry nicely and again these really
could<00:05:47.919> be<00:05:48.039> used<00:05:48.280> as<00:05:49.180> ornaments<00:05:49.630> and<00:05:50.050> they're

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
could be used as ornaments and they're

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.060 
could be used as ornaments and they're
certainly<00:05:50.740> edible<00:05:51.039> so<00:05:51.250> either<00:05:51.550> way<00:05:53.070> so

right<00:05:57.220> over<00:05:57.520> the<00:05:57.820> cookie<00:06:00.690> that's<00:06:01.690> got<00:06:01.870> a

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
right over the cookie that's got a

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.440

really nice sparkly effect you could use

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.779 
really nice sparkly effect you could use
they<00:06:04.630> actually<00:06:04.930> make<00:06:05.080> sanding<00:06:05.500> sugar<00:06:05.680> in<00:06:06.220> all

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:06.789 
they actually make sanding sugar in all

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:08.159 
they actually make sanding sugar in all
different<00:06:06.940> colors<00:06:07.210> you<00:06:07.510> could<00:06:07.630> use<00:06:07.780> a<00:06:07.840> colored

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:08.169 
different colors you could use a colored

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:10.020 
different colors you could use a colored
sugar<00:06:08.440> but<00:06:09.010> I<00:06:09.039> like<00:06:09.250> the<00:06:09.370> purity<00:06:09.789> and<00:06:09.820> the

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.030 
sugar but I like the purity and the

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.800 
sugar but I like the purity and the
starkness<00:06:10.360> of<00:06:10.690> the<00:06:10.840> the<00:06:11.320> clear<00:06:11.620> sugar<00:06:12.810> and

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
starkness of the the clear sugar and

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.300
