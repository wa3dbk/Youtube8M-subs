hey guys Alan Haines here is the lawn

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.600 
hey guys Alan Haines here is the lawn
care<00:00:09.380> nut<00:00:09.559> and<00:00:09.710> let's<00:00:09.890> do<00:00:10.010> a<00:00:10.040> quick<00:00:10.130> video

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:10.610 
care nut and let's do a quick video

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.879 
care nut and let's do a quick video
again<00:00:11.180> about<00:00:11.480> lawn<00:00:11.750> striping<00:00:12.350> so<00:00:12.590> you've<00:00:12.710> seen

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:12.889 
again about lawn striping so you've seen

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:14.410 
again about lawn striping so you've seen
all<00:00:13.070> my<00:00:13.190> videos<00:00:13.610> that<00:00:13.820> I've<00:00:13.910> done<00:00:14.120> on<00:00:14.210> how<00:00:14.360> to

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:14.420 
all my videos that I've done on how to

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.700 
all my videos that I've done on how to
most<00:00:14.660> stripes<00:00:14.930> in<00:00:15.050> the<00:00:15.110> lawn<00:00:15.290> and<00:00:15.320> I'll<00:00:15.530> link

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:15.710 
most stripes in the lawn and I'll link

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:16.900 
most stripes in the lawn and I'll link
to<00:00:15.800> a<00:00:15.890> whole<00:00:16.099> bunch<00:00:16.130> of<00:00:16.430> them<00:00:16.550> below<00:00:16.760> in<00:00:16.849> the

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
to a whole bunch of them below in the

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.820 
to a whole bunch of them below in the
description<00:00:17.390> but<00:00:17.990> I<00:00:18.050> do<00:00:18.140> get<00:00:18.380> the<00:00:18.439> question

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
description but I do get the question

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.710 
description but I do get the question
quite<00:00:19.040> often<00:00:19.250> ok<00:00:19.730> Alan<00:00:20.060> you<00:00:20.210> showed<00:00:20.420> us<00:00:20.570> how<00:00:20.660> to

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
quite often ok Alan you showed us how to

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.839 
quite often ok Alan you showed us how to
most<00:00:20.960> stripes<00:00:21.320> but<00:00:21.560> how<00:00:21.770> is<00:00:21.980> that<00:00:22.579> actually

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:22.849 
most stripes but how is that actually

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:24.729 
most stripes but how is that actually
working<00:00:23.360> like<00:00:23.689> what<00:00:23.930> are<00:00:24.050> the<00:00:24.140> physics<00:00:24.590> behind

00:00:24.729 --> 00:00:24.739 
working like what are the physics behind

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:27.069 
working like what are the physics behind
it<00:00:25.099> and<00:00:25.460> I<00:00:25.550> guess<00:00:25.730> I<00:00:25.820> took<00:00:25.880> it<00:00:26.090> for<00:00:26.210> granted<00:00:26.450> but

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:27.079 
it and I guess I took it for granted but

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:28.120 
it and I guess I took it for granted but
I'm<00:00:27.169> gonna<00:00:27.320> go<00:00:27.410> ahead<00:00:27.470> and<00:00:27.560> explain<00:00:27.860> it<00:00:27.980> to<00:00:28.040> you

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
I'm gonna go ahead and explain it to you

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.249 
I'm gonna go ahead and explain it to you
today<00:00:28.369> so<00:00:28.880> here<00:00:29.060> I<00:00:29.090> am<00:00:29.210> doing<00:00:29.570> my<00:00:29.720> very<00:00:29.779> first

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:30.259 
today so here I am doing my very first

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:32.560 
today so here I am doing my very first
striping<00:00:30.890> of<00:00:31.009> the<00:00:31.099> year<00:00:31.279> here<00:00:31.489> in<00:00:31.550> 2015<00:00:32.390> and

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
striping of the year here in 2015 and

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.270 
striping of the year here in 2015 and
darn<00:00:33.470> my<00:00:34.010> lawn<00:00:34.399> she's<00:00:34.910> a<00:00:34.940> looking<00:00:35.360> beautiful

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
darn my lawn she's a looking beautiful

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.950 
darn my lawn she's a looking beautiful
alright<00:00:37.280> so<00:00:37.550> how<00:00:37.760> do<00:00:37.820> the<00:00:38.059> stripes<00:00:38.390> work<00:00:38.690> well

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
alright so how do the stripes work well

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.520 
alright so how do the stripes work well
the<00:00:39.080> key<00:00:39.320> starts<00:00:40.010> with<00:00:40.400> mister<00:00:40.940> sunlight<00:00:41.750> the

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
the key starts with mister sunlight the

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.910 
the key starts with mister sunlight the
Sun<00:00:42.890> is<00:00:43.250> what<00:00:43.760> makes<00:00:44.060> lawn<00:00:44.420> stripes<00:00:44.930> visible

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
Sun is what makes lawn stripes visible

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.000 
Sun is what makes lawn stripes visible
to<00:00:46.220> the<00:00:46.340> eye<00:00:46.930> so<00:00:47.930> once<00:00:48.110> we<00:00:48.260> have<00:00:48.350> Sun<00:00:48.620> now<00:00:48.950> we

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
to the eye so once we have Sun now we

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.920 
to the eye so once we have Sun now we
need<00:00:49.280> to<00:00:49.340> figure<00:00:49.550> out<00:00:49.670> how<00:00:49.970> can<00:00:50.030> we<00:00:50.270> reflect

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
need to figure out how can we reflect

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.320 
need to figure out how can we reflect
the<00:00:51.260> Sun<00:00:51.530> differently<00:00:52.370> to<00:00:52.910> the<00:00:53.060> viewer

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.330 
the Sun differently to the viewer

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.090 
the Sun differently to the viewer
because<00:00:53.990> that's<00:00:54.230> what<00:00:54.410> makes<00:00:54.620> the<00:00:54.800> stripes

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
because that's what makes the stripes

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.450 
because that's what makes the stripes
certain<00:00:56.090> grass<00:00:56.450> lines<00:00:56.990> are<00:00:57.350> reflecting<00:00:58.100> one

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
certain grass lines are reflecting one

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.790 
certain grass lines are reflecting one
way<00:00:58.700> in<00:00:58.940> the<00:00:59.030> light<00:00:59.210> and<00:00:59.420> other<00:00:59.840> grass<00:01:00.380> lines

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
way in the light and other grass lines

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.530 
way in the light and other grass lines
are<00:01:01.010> reflecting<00:01:01.490> the<00:01:01.520> other<00:01:01.760> so<00:01:02.300> let's<00:01:02.480> zoom

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
are reflecting the other so let's zoom

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:10.110 
are reflecting the other so let's zoom
in<00:01:02.780> here<00:01:02.900> and<00:01:03.020> we'll<00:01:03.170> see

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.090 

so<00:01:11.120> first<00:01:11.390> let's<00:01:11.630> start<00:01:11.690> see<00:01:12.409> how<00:01:12.530> all<00:01:12.860> the

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
so first let's start see how all the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.130 
so first let's start see how all the
blades<00:01:13.340> in<00:01:13.580> this<00:01:13.820> particular<00:01:14.510> row<00:01:14.810> are<00:01:15.110> a

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
blades in this particular row are a

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.950 
blades in this particular row are a
little<00:01:15.530> bit<00:01:15.740> angled<00:01:16.130> to<00:01:16.370> the<00:01:16.400> right<00:01:16.670> and<00:01:16.960> then

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
little bit angled to the right and then

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.500 
little bit angled to the right and then
see<00:01:18.110> as<00:01:18.229> I<00:01:18.290> go<00:01:18.320> to<00:01:18.500> this<00:01:18.680> next<00:01:19.550> line<00:01:19.760> all<00:01:20.090> of

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
see as I go to this next line all of

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.109 
see as I go to this next line all of
these<00:01:20.750> blades<00:01:21.050> are<00:01:21.260> slightly<00:01:22.040> angled<00:01:22.550> to<00:01:22.880> the

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
these blades are slightly angled to the

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.230 
these blades are slightly angled to the
left<00:01:23.590> what<00:01:24.590> that<00:01:24.770> does<00:01:25.040> is<00:01:25.220> that<00:01:25.250> changes<00:01:26.090> the

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
left what that does is that changes the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.090 
left what that does is that changes the
reflection<00:01:26.840> of<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.050> sunlight<00:01:27.290> and<00:01:27.650> creates

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
reflection of the sunlight and creates

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.040 
reflection of the sunlight and creates
the<00:01:28.310> stripes<00:01:28.610> and<00:01:28.850> then<00:01:29.479> people<00:01:29.690> will<00:01:29.869> say

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
the stripes and then people will say

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.590 
the stripes and then people will say
okay<00:01:30.500> so<00:01:30.560> how<00:01:31.070> do<00:01:31.130> you<00:01:31.430> get<00:01:31.759> the<00:01:32.030> grass<00:01:32.270> blades

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
okay so how do you get the grass blades

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.300 
okay so how do you get the grass blades
to<00:01:32.750> lay<00:01:32.869> that<00:01:33.080> way<00:01:33.229> and<00:01:33.440> that's<00:01:33.890> where<00:01:34.070> we<00:01:34.159> come

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
to lay that way and that's where we come

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.520 
to lay that way and that's where we come
in<00:01:34.430> with<00:01:34.550> our<00:01:34.610> striping<00:01:35.450> equipment<00:01:35.930> so<00:01:36.350> I've

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
in with our striping equipment so I've

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.870 
in with our striping equipment so I've
got<00:01:36.710> a<00:01:36.740> couple<00:01:36.979> videos<00:01:37.340> i<00:01:37.369> linked<00:01:37.640> to<00:01:37.729> below

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
got a couple videos i linked to below

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.430 
got a couple videos i linked to below
there's<00:01:38.270> a<00:01:38.330> different<00:01:38.659> ways<00:01:38.810> to<00:01:39.020> stripe<00:01:39.290> the

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
there's a different ways to stripe the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.109 
there's a different ways to stripe the
lawn<00:01:39.619> you<00:01:39.650> can<00:01:39.950> use<00:01:40.130> the<00:01:40.280> Toro<00:01:40.550> lawn<00:01:40.729> striper

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
lawn you can use the Toro lawn striper

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.090 
lawn you can use the Toro lawn striper
like<00:01:41.390> I<00:01:41.479> use<00:01:41.630> here<00:01:41.990> or<00:01:42.500> I<00:01:42.530> also<00:01:42.770> have<00:01:43.070> a

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
like I use here or I also have a

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.609 
like I use here or I also have a
do-it-yourself<00:01:44.030> version<00:01:44.360> that'll<00:01:45.140> also<00:01:45.320> work

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
do-it-yourself version that'll also work

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:47.620 
do-it-yourself version that'll also work
very<00:01:45.649> well<00:01:46.090> all<00:01:47.090> right<00:01:47.210> so<00:01:47.330> let<00:01:47.450> me<00:01:47.539> illustrate

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
very well all right so let me illustrate

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.210 
very well all right so let me illustrate
it<00:01:47.930> another<00:01:48.170> way<00:01:48.320> you<00:01:48.590> can<00:01:48.740> see<00:01:48.979> me<00:01:49.100> here

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
it another way you can see me here

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.950 
it another way you can see me here
walking<00:01:49.520> up<00:01:49.820> there<00:01:50.060> I<00:01:50.090> am<00:01:50.330> in<00:01:50.509> the<00:01:50.570> background

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
walking up there I am in the background

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.990 
walking up there I am in the background
the<00:01:51.740> stripe<00:01:52.039> that<00:01:52.190> I'm<00:01:52.310> standing<00:01:52.550> and<00:01:52.820> waving

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
the stripe that I'm standing and waving

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.419 
the stripe that I'm standing and waving
now<00:01:53.330> that's<00:01:53.960> actually<00:01:54.440> those<00:01:54.770> grass<00:01:55.100> blades

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
now that's actually those grass blades

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:57.969 
now that's actually those grass blades
have<00:01:55.610> been<00:01:55.820> pressed<00:01:56.210> slightly<00:01:56.899> away<00:01:57.350> from<00:01:57.710> you

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
have been pressed slightly away from you

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.160 
have been pressed slightly away from you
in<00:01:58.250> the<00:01:58.369> view<00:01:58.550> that<00:01:58.670> you're<00:01:58.820> at<00:01:59.000> here<00:01:59.330> now<00:02:00.020> this

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
in the view that you're at here now this

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.560 
in the view that you're at here now this
other<00:02:00.440> one<00:02:00.710> when<00:02:01.009> I<00:02:01.039> step<00:02:01.310> next<00:02:01.490> to<00:02:01.670> it<00:02:01.789> these

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
other one when I step next to it these

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.300 
other one when I step next to it these
grass<00:02:02.869> blades<00:02:03.170> are<00:02:03.320> pointing<00:02:03.679> towards<00:02:04.100> you

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
grass blades are pointing towards you

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.340 
grass blades are pointing towards you
and<00:02:04.490> that's<00:02:05.149> what<00:02:05.330> the<00:02:05.420> striper<00:02:05.810> does<00:02:06.140> it

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
and that's what the striper does it

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.770 
and that's what the striper does it
pushes<00:02:06.830> the<00:02:06.979> grass<00:02:07.190> blades<00:02:07.580> down<00:02:07.850> as<00:02:08.090> you<00:02:08.509> mow

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
pushes the grass blades down as you mow

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.050 
pushes the grass blades down as you mow
and<00:02:09.080> it<00:02:09.709> allows<00:02:10.039> the<00:02:10.340> Sun<00:02:10.610> to<00:02:10.729> reflect

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
and it allows the Sun to reflect

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.720 
and it allows the Sun to reflect
differently<00:02:11.570> now<00:02:11.900> finally<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.980> very<00:02:13.250> best

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
differently now finally the very best

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.120 
differently now finally the very best
and<00:02:14.030> most<00:02:14.209> striking<00:02:14.720> stripes<00:02:15.049> will<00:02:15.260> come<00:02:15.530> from

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
and most striking stripes will come from

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.090 
and most striking stripes will come from
the<00:02:16.250> view<00:02:16.640> when<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.660> Sun<00:02:17.930> is<00:02:18.110> either<00:02:18.260> overhead

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
the view when the Sun is either overhead

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.580 
the view when the Sun is either overhead
of<00:02:19.340> you<00:02:19.670> or<00:02:19.910> just<00:02:20.239> slightly<00:02:20.540> behind<00:02:20.840> you<00:02:21.380> if

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590

you the stripes will not look as

you the stripes will not look as

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
striking as they will if the Sun is

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.100 
striking as they will if the Sun is
overhead<00:02:27.620> or<00:02:28.040> behind<00:02:28.400> you<00:02:28.610> fYI<00:02:29.510> if<00:02:29.959> you're
