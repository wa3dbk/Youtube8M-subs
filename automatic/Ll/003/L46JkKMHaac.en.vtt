to<00:03:30.340> position<00:03:30.730> them<00:03:30.880> we'll<00:03:31.000> take<00:03:31.180> a<00:03:31.209> look<00:03:31.360> when

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
to position them we'll take a look when

we see the console itself and then as if

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:35.880 
we see the console itself and then as if
it's<00:03:34.570> overkill<00:03:35.110> almost<00:03:35.500> we<00:03:35.620> get<00:03:35.739> a<00:03:35.769> nice

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
it's overkill almost we get a nice

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.979 
it's overkill almost we get a nice
plastic<00:03:36.160> stent<00:03:36.549> to<00:03:36.820> actually<00:03:37.510> hold<00:03:37.660> the<00:03:37.780> wii<00:03:37.870> u

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
doesn't have another next to it we've

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.660 
doesn't have another next to it we've
got<00:03:48.820> a<00:03:48.850> pretty<00:03:49.540> basic<00:03:49.890> wii<00:03:50.890> u<00:03:51.040> sensor<00:03:51.400> bar<00:03:51.549> when

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
got a pretty basic wii u sensor bar when

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:52.800 
got a pretty basic wii u sensor bar when
i'm<00:03:51.760> going<00:03:51.970> to<00:03:52.030> wrap<00:03:52.209> that<00:03:52.390> because<00:03:52.660> we're

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
i'm going to wrap that because we're

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:53.729 
i'm going to wrap that because we're
pretty<00:03:52.989> sure<00:03:53.079> we're<00:03:53.320> just<00:03:53.440> going<00:03:53.560> to<00:03:53.590> use<00:03:53.709> the

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
pretty sure we're just going to use the

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.199 
pretty sure we're just going to use the
old<00:03:53.890> sensor<00:03:54.190> whether<00:03:54.370> we've<00:03:54.519> got<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:55.030> same

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
old sensor whether we've got the same

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.819 
old sensor whether we've got the same
connector<00:03:55.570> on<00:03:55.660> the<00:03:55.690> end<00:03:55.810> so<00:03:55.959> we'll<00:03:56.560> go<00:03:56.680> with

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
connector on the end so we'll go with

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:00.479 
connector on the end so we'll go with
that<00:03:56.860> and<00:03:57.870> then<00:03:58.870> for<00:03:59.470> the<00:03:59.530> first<00:03:59.560> time<00:03:59.980> in<00:04:00.280> any

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
that and then for the first time in any

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.220 
that and then for the first time in any
major<00:04:00.730> console<00:04:01.239> generation<00:04:01.660> which<00:04:01.780> is<00:04:01.900> kind

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
major console generation which is kind

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.620 
major console generation which is kind
of<00:04:02.320> shocking<00:04:02.470> considering<00:04:02.980> the<00:04:03.190> ps3<00:04:03.730> we<00:04:04.420> have

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
of shocking considering the ps3 we have

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.720 
of shocking considering the ps3 we have
actual<00:04:04.959> hdmi<00:04:05.829> cables<00:04:06.190> coming<00:04:06.400> with<00:04:06.609> the

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
actual hdmi cables coming with the

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.009 
actual hdmi cables coming with the
console<00:04:07.090> it's<00:04:07.269> kind<00:04:07.450> of<00:04:07.480> ironic<00:04:07.600> that<00:04:07.900> it's

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
console it's kind of ironic that it's

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:09.539 
console it's kind of ironic that it's
coming<00:04:08.170> with<00:04:08.290> a<00:04:08.350> nintendo<00:04:08.739> console<00:04:09.100> first<00:04:09.310> but

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
coming with a nintendo console first but

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.610 
coming with a nintendo console first but
that's<00:04:09.700> the<00:04:09.850> that's<00:04:10.690> besides<00:04:11.079> the<00:04:11.170> point<00:04:11.290> they

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
that's the that's besides the point they

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.830 
that's the that's besides the point they
are<00:04:11.769> Nintendo<00:04:12.220> branded<00:04:12.609> on<00:04:12.730> one<00:04:13.450> end<00:04:13.630> of<00:04:13.720> them

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
are Nintendo branded on one end of them

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.479 
are Nintendo branded on one end of them
so<00:04:14.079> it<00:04:14.320> is<00:04:14.350> really<00:04:14.590> nice<00:04:14.799> to<00:04:14.859> see<00:04:15.459> that

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
so it is really nice to see that

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:16.920 
so it is really nice to see that
Nintendo<00:04:16.000> is<00:04:16.060> actually<00:04:16.359> not<00:04:16.510> just<00:04:16.750> thrown

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
Nintendo is actually not just thrown

this is the console right here you can
see<00:05:07.520> the<00:05:07.550> gamepad<00:05:08.000> is<00:05:08.030> just<00:05:08.420> slightly<00:05:08.630> smaller

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
see the gamepad is just slightly smaller

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.080 
see the gamepad is just slightly smaller
than<00:05:09.170> the<00:05:09.350> console<00:05:09.740> itself<00:05:09.830> obviously<00:05:10.790> a

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
than the console itself obviously a

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.700 
than the console itself obviously a
little<00:05:11.150> bit<00:05:11.330> thicker<00:05:11.510> if<00:05:12.410> you<00:05:12.500> want<00:05:12.650> to

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
little bit thicker if you want to

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.680 
little bit thicker if you want to
compare<00:05:12.860> it<00:05:13.010> to<00:05:13.070> a<00:05:13.160> 3ds<00:05:13.490> a<00:05:13.760> 3ds<00:05:14.090> will<00:05:14.300> sit<00:05:14.510> right

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
compare it to a 3ds a 3ds will sit right

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.330 
compare it to a 3ds a 3ds will sit right
on<00:05:14.720> top<00:05:14.840> of<00:05:14.990> its<00:05:15.230> screen<00:05:15.500> and<00:05:15.740> the<00:05:16.100> screen<00:05:16.130> is

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
on top of its screen and the screen is

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.310 
on top of its screen and the screen is
just<00:05:16.610> a<00:05:16.640> little<00:05:16.760> bit<00:05:16.910> larger<00:05:17.180> than<00:05:17.210> a<00:05:17.330> 3ds<00:05:17.660> 3ds

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
just a little bit larger than a 3ds 3ds

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.990 
just a little bit larger than a 3ds 3ds
XL<00:05:18.680> obviously<00:05:19.340> is<00:05:19.400> going<00:05:19.520> to<00:05:19.580> be<00:05:19.640> a<00:05:19.670> lot<00:05:19.790> larger

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
XL obviously is going to be a lot larger

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.990 
XL obviously is going to be a lot larger
than<00:05:20.210> that<00:05:20.420> a<00:05:21.260> really<00:05:21.890> really<00:05:22.400> great<00:05:22.580> console

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
than that a really really great console

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.640 
than that a really really great console
so<00:05:23.150> far<00:05:23.360> unfortunately<00:05:23.960> we<00:05:24.050> can't<00:05:24.290> turn<00:05:24.410> it<00:05:24.560> on

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
so far unfortunately we can't turn it on
