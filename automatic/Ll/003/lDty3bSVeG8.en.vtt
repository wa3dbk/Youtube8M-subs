now<00:05:38.490> that<00:05:38.729> we've<00:05:38.879> tested<00:05:39.120> our<00:05:39.449> program<00:05:39.900> and

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
now that we've tested our program and

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.839 
now that we've tested our program and
see<00:05:40.110> that<00:05:40.379> it<00:05:40.530> actually<00:05:40.740> functions<00:05:41.610> and<00:05:41.789> it

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:41.849 
see that it actually functions and it

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:43.580 
see that it actually functions and it
works<00:05:42.060> property<00:05:42.569> that<00:05:42.719> we<00:05:42.870> want<00:05:43.050> working<00:05:43.379> our

work envelope and it does not fault out
we<00:05:46.169> will<00:05:46.289> run<00:05:46.499> the<00:05:46.650> program<00:05:47.039> continuous<00:05:47.610> mode

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580
