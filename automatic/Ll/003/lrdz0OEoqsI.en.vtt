00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.720

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.400
 enter the world 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.090

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.510
 creative let's put all the things 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:41.950
 we want we can put what 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:45.010
 we want we have free 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:50.710
 selection to put absolutely everything 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:53.950
 by choice then we get out of here 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.750
 We are going to tell you that we are going to have what 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.550
 we will have to download from before 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.519
 from said on the network 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.540
 there forme love dotcom reach the repo 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.460
 we enter default 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:08.290
 we go to the root 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.290
 the roots as far as it hits 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.850
 ok here we are going to look for the folder yo 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.600
 I know it was usually the 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:22.810
 the last but one last but one we chose 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.580
 we enter applications in minecraft 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.340
 the applications here give us to him and 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.600
 with name so up to thousand with ones 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.980
 numbers then what we have to 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.520
 to do is to trial and error search 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:36.609
 minecraft but as I already know 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.119
 is this folder we enter documents to 

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:43.210
 game monks and and mind of words here 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.250
 are the two worlds obvious to you not 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.600
 they will look creative and their rival will 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.000
 will appear the name that you 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.929
 put then we have to enter the 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.409
 creative we have to copy the files 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:56.040
 jones 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.650
 copy 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.870
 we have to go to his rival the bad is 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.850
 that your map disappears in which you are 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.560
 what you have to do is first 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.940
 grab all that all things 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:12.880
 what you want and then go crazy 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:15.760
 we paste subscribe overwrite everything yes 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.090
 we give him ok we go back we go to 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.090
 Minecraft 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.150
 and we enter the survival map 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.610
 let's load a little 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.610
 Y 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.400
 ah, caray 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:47.400
 for here are the things I want that 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.650
 sometimes that moves the place of spam 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.819
 and you have to look for things and there they are 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.950
 it's your turn to look for things a little 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.349
 but it's not so much trouble since the map 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.180
 it's not so gigantic that we say it's 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:02.950
 small itself 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.780
 and of things 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:10.209
 this is how the quotes works 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.959
 quotes too many items for minecraft 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.959
 pocket edition 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.640
 no more thank you very much
