00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
top here and we'll hide that for now

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.430 
top here and we'll hide that for now
until<00:00:47.489> we<00:00:47.760> need<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:47.969> later<00:00:48.239> now<00:00:49.050> we<00:00:49.110> need<00:00:49.350> to

make a selection in the sky and usually

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.959 
make a selection in the sky and usually
people<00:00:52.680> will<00:00:52.800> go<00:00:52.949> straight<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.640> magic

the items in the foreground

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.660 
the items in the foreground
that<00:03:31.470> way<00:03:31.590> it'll<00:03:31.769> blend<00:03:32.010> better<00:03:32.250> with<00:03:32.430> the

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
that way it'll blend better with the

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.210 
that way it'll blend better with the
final<00:03:33.030> sky<00:03:33.299> that<00:03:33.540> we<00:03:33.630> put<00:03:33.900> in<00:03:34.079> so<00:03:34.890> that<00:03:35.040> looks

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
final sky that we put in so that looks

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.920 
final sky that we put in so that looks
pretty<00:03:35.459> good<00:03:35.579> now<00:03:35.970> I'm<00:03:36.090> just<00:03:36.209> gonna<00:03:36.299> hit<00:03:36.540> OK

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
pretty good now I'm just gonna hit OK

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.500 
pretty good now I'm just gonna hit OK
next<00:03:37.860> I'm<00:03:37.980> going<00:03:38.100> to<00:03:38.190> select<00:03:38.370> my<00:03:38.610> clouds<00:03:39.090> layer

next I'm going to select my clouds layer

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.259 
next I'm going to select my clouds layer
and<00:03:39.959> I'm<00:03:40.470> gonna<00:03:40.590> click<00:03:40.860> the<00:03:41.100> new<00:03:41.640> layer<00:03:41.670> mask

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
and I'm gonna click the new layer mask

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.560 
and I'm gonna click the new layer mask
icon<00:03:42.660> down<00:03:43.230> here<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:43.890> I'm<00:03:44.880> gonna<00:03:44.970> unhide<00:03:45.540> it

and<00:03:45.900> you'll<00:03:46.109> see<00:03:46.350> immediately<00:03:46.890> that<00:03:47.220> our<00:03:47.790> sky

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
and you'll see immediately that our sky

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.420 
and you'll see immediately that our sky
gets<00:03:48.359> put<00:03:48.630> into<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:48.989> image<00:03:49.320> based<00:03:50.010> on<00:03:50.250> this

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
gets put into the image based on this

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.370 
gets put into the image based on this
layer<00:03:50.700> mask<00:03:51.000> information<00:03:51.840> from<00:03:52.200> the

layer mask information from the
selection<00:03:52.890> that<00:03:52.980> we<00:03:53.040> made<00:03:53.310> earlier<00:03:53.700> usually

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
selection that we made earlier usually

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.990 
selection that we made earlier usually
the<00:03:54.780> sky<00:03:55.079> is<00:03:55.140> whiter<00:03:55.620> at<00:03:55.890> the<00:03:56.040> horizon<00:03:56.190> plus

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
the sky is whiter at the horizon plus

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.050 
the sky is whiter at the horizon plus
our<00:03:57.209> original<00:03:57.750> sky<00:03:58.079> here<00:03:58.440> is<00:03:58.560> mainly<00:03:58.950> white<00:03:59.370> so

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
our original sky here is mainly white so

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.759 
our original sky here is mainly white so
I'm<00:04:00.120> gonna<00:04:00.239> fade<00:04:00.600> this<00:04:00.840> in<00:04:01.079> just<00:04:01.380> so<00:04:01.590> it<00:04:01.739> looks

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
I'm gonna fade this in just so it looks

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.190 
I'm gonna fade this in just so it looks
more<00:04:02.010> realistic<00:04:02.519> so<00:04:03.180> I'm<00:04:03.269> gonna<00:04:03.359> duplicate<00:04:03.989> my

fade this

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.510

guy in from the bottom to the top and
you<00:04:29.969> can<00:04:30.150> keep<00:04:30.330> painting<00:04:30.870> until<00:04:31.199> you<00:04:31.409> get<00:04:31.949> a

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
you can keep painting until you get a

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:35.149 
you can keep painting until you get a
gradient<00:04:32.310> that<00:04:32.550> you<00:04:32.789> like<00:04:33.620> and<00:04:34.620> once<00:04:34.830> you<00:04:35.009> have

00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:35.159 
gradient that you like and once you have

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:36.980 
gradient that you like and once you have
one<00:04:35.370> that<00:04:35.460> you<00:04:35.520> like<00:04:35.819> just<00:04:36.150> hit<00:04:36.300> ctrl<00:04:36.780> or

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
one that you like just hit ctrl or

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.200 
one that you like just hit ctrl or
command<00:04:37.020> D<00:04:37.469> to<00:04:37.800> deselect<00:04:37.889> your<00:04:38.669> image

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
command D to deselect your image

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.510 
command D to deselect your image
lastly<00:04:40.110> you<00:04:40.319> can<00:04:40.379> create<00:04:40.889> something<00:04:41.219> like<00:04:41.370> a

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
lastly you can create something like a

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.670 
lastly you can create something like a
curves<00:04:41.909> adjustment<00:04:42.569> layer<00:04:42.629> to<00:04:43.110> apply<00:04:43.409> to<00:04:43.469> the

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
curves adjustment layer to apply to the

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.219 
curves adjustment layer to apply to the
entire<00:04:43.770> image<00:04:44.340> that<00:04:45.300> way<00:04:45.509> it<00:04:45.659> makes<00:04:45.840> it<00:04:46.050> look

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
entire image that way it makes it look

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:48.200 
entire image that way it makes it look
more<00:04:46.259> realistic<00:04:47.159> and<00:04:47.280> it<00:04:47.430> blends<00:04:47.699> just<00:04:48.060> a

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
more realistic and it blends just a

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.330 
more realistic and it blends just a
little<00:04:48.449> bit<00:04:48.599> better<00:04:48.810> now<00:04:49.770> you<00:04:49.830> can<00:04:50.039> see<00:04:50.219> the

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
little bit better now you can see the

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.580 
little bit better now you can see the
before<00:04:50.729> and<00:04:50.759> after<00:04:51.060> so<00:04:51.810> here's<00:04:52.080> the<00:04:52.229> before

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
before and after so here's the before

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.830 
before and after so here's the before
with<00:04:52.770> our<00:04:52.830> boring<00:04:53.370> white<00:04:53.580> sky<00:04:53.969> and<00:04:54.569> if<00:04:54.659> I<00:04:54.780> turn

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
with our boring white sky and if I turn

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.600 
with our boring white sky and if I turn
these<00:04:55.229> layers<00:04:55.500> back<00:04:55.800> on<00:04:56.069> you<00:04:56.250> can<00:04:56.400> see<00:04:56.580> the

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
these layers back on you can see the

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.700 
these layers back on you can see the
after<00:04:57.120> with<00:04:57.389> the<00:04:57.569> sky<00:04:57.810> that<00:04:58.020> we<00:04:58.110> just<00:04:58.349> put<00:04:58.560> in

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
after with the sky that we just put in

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.260 
after with the sky that we just put in
and<00:04:58.919> it<00:04:58.979> makes<00:04:59.129> the<00:04:59.340> image<00:04:59.370> look<00:04:59.610> a<00:04:59.909> lot<00:05:00.090> more

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
and it makes the image look a lot more

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.510 
and it makes the image look a lot more
interesting<00:05:00.960> now<00:05:01.469> the<00:05:01.529> more<00:05:01.919> complex<00:05:02.310> your

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
interesting now the more complex your

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.670 
interesting now the more complex your
original<00:05:03.150> sky<00:05:03.479> is<00:05:03.539> the<00:05:03.719> longer<00:05:04.319> this<00:05:04.500> will

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
original sky is the longer this will

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.830 
original sky is the longer this will
take<00:05:04.949> and<00:05:05.250> the<00:05:05.639> more<00:05:05.789> time<00:05:06.029> you<00:05:06.180> spend<00:05:06.210> on<00:05:06.629> your

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
take and the more time you spend on your

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.689 
take and the more time you spend on your
selection<00:05:07.409> the<00:05:07.439> more<00:05:07.740> believable<00:05:08.099> your<00:05:08.520> new

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 
selection the more believable your new

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:10.939 
selection the more believable your new
sky<00:05:08.969> will<00:05:09.210> look<00:05:09.389> I'm<00:05:09.689> John<00:05:10.229> shaver<00:05:10.590> for

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949 
sky will look I'm John shaver for
