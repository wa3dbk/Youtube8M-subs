00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
for that would be an eavesdropper

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.840 
for that would be an eavesdropper
because<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.750> can<00:01:54.930> say<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.350> scoops<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.430> it's<00:01:56.640> not

because I can say is scoops and it's not
much<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.570> saying<00:01:57.869> it's<00:01:58.079> not<00:01:58.229> saying

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
next I'm going to tell you is Sakai and

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.770 
next I'm going to tell you is Sakai and
I<00:02:57.099> used<00:02:57.310> to<00:02:57.430> use<00:02:57.609> this<00:02:57.790> term<00:02:58.000> a<00:02:58.180> lot<00:02:58.390> when<00:02:58.569> I<00:02:58.629> was

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
I used to use this term a lot when I was

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.539 
I used to use this term a lot when I was
younger<00:02:59.109> I<00:02:59.290> don't<00:02:59.530> necessarily<00:03:00.129> use<00:03:00.250> it<00:03:00.370> very

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
younger I don't necessarily use it very

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.910 
younger I don't necessarily use it very
much<00:03:00.790> now<00:03:01.090> but<00:03:01.900> this<00:03:02.230> is<00:03:02.290> a<00:03:02.470> term<00:03:02.709> that<00:03:02.739> means

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
much now but this is a term that means

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.880 
much now but this is a term that means
very<00:03:03.519> easy<00:03:03.940> so<00:03:04.239> if<00:03:04.359> a<00:03:04.510> test<00:03:04.900> was<00:03:05.200> easy<00:03:05.409> you

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
very easy so if a test was easy you

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.160 
very easy so if a test was easy you
would<00:03:05.980> say<00:03:06.129> this<00:03:06.549> test<00:03:06.790> was<00:03:06.970> Sakai<00:03:07.390> now

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
would say this test was Sakai now

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.080 
would say this test was Sakai now
another<00:03:08.500> thing<00:03:08.620> that<00:03:08.980> turned<00:03:09.190> audience<00:03:09.579> do<00:03:09.849> is

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
another thing that turned audience do is

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.369 
another thing that turned audience do is
we<00:03:10.390> shortened<00:03:10.900> words

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
we shortened words

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.890 
we shortened words
so<00:03:11.590> where<00:03:11.799> is<00:03:11.920> ending<00:03:12.280> in<00:03:12.400> ing<00:03:12.690> we<00:03:13.690> don't

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
so where is ending in ing we don't

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.900 
so where is ending in ing we don't
necessarily<00:03:14.169> pronounce<00:03:15.069> the<00:03:15.340> G<00:03:15.519> at<00:03:15.639> the<00:03:15.760> end

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
necessarily pronounce the G at the end

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.599 
necessarily pronounce the G at the end
so<00:03:16.419> if<00:03:16.599> I<00:03:16.780> were<00:03:16.959> to<00:03:17.230> take<00:03:17.380> an<00:03:17.530> example<00:03:17.799> writing

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
so if I were to take an example writing

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.780 
so if I were to take an example writing
I<00:03:18.819> am<00:03:19.359> writing<00:03:19.630> I<00:03:19.989> would<00:03:20.049> say<00:03:20.200> I<00:03:20.230> am<00:03:20.410> writing<00:03:20.790> so

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
I am writing I would say I am writing so

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.670 
I am writing I would say I am writing so
it<00:03:22.000> would<00:03:22.120> end<00:03:22.329> like<00:03:22.510> if<00:03:22.810> you<00:03:23.139> had<00:03:23.260> to<00:03:23.349> write<00:03:23.470> it
