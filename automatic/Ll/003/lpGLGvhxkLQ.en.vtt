viewers<00:00:50.879> may<00:00:51.090> see<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.539> mentioned<00:00:52.050> this

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140

viewers may see that I mentioned this
once<00:00:52.410> before<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:53.340> don't<00:00:53.579> know<00:00:53.670> six<00:00:53.879> months<00:00:53.969> ago

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
once before I don't know six months ago

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.389 
once before I don't know six months ago
but<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.899> probably<00:00:55.649> picked<00:00:55.949> up<00:00:56.039> literally

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
but I probably picked up literally

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.310 
but I probably picked up literally
eighty<00:00:57.059> thousand<00:00:57.510> subs<00:00:57.719> since<00:00:57.960> then<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.289> I

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
eighty thousand subs since then so I

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.889 
eighty thousand subs since then so I
think<00:00:58.410> it'll<00:00:58.649> be<00:00:58.739> new<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.070> lot<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:00.420> I

Xbox works together and why ping is

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.870 
Xbox works together and why ping is
important<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.280> get<00:01:14.369> your<00:01:14.430> bullets<00:01:14.790> to

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
important to get your bullets to

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.609

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
register faster and and it's more than

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:17.840 
register faster and and it's more than
just<00:01:16.740> your<00:01:16.920> bullets<00:01:17.189> registering<00:01:17.549> faster

just your bullets registering faster

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:18.679 
just your bullets registering faster
you're<00:01:17.970> also<00:01:18.060> learning<00:01:18.270> about<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.570> other

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
you're also learning about the other

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.999 
you're also learning about the other
characters<00:01:19.140> movements<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.619> little<00:01:19.830> quicker

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
characters movements a little quicker

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.740 
characters movements a little quicker
like<00:01:20.280> when<00:01:20.460> first<00:01:20.670> pops<00:01:20.909> up<00:01:21.090> his<00:01:21.240> head<00:01:21.390> after<00:01:21.720> a

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
like when first pops up his head after a

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.780 
like when first pops up his head after a
barrel<00:01:22.110> then<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.770> auto<00:01:22.950> aim<00:01:23.159> seems<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.640> work

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
barrel then the auto aim seems to work

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.789 
barrel then the auto aim seems to work
better<00:01:24.060> because<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.170> ties<00:01:25.350> in<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.650> get

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
better because and that ties in to get

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.530 
better because and that ties in to get
knowing<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.159> characters<00:01:26.549> movements<00:01:26.970> so

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
knowing the characters movements so

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.600 
knowing the characters movements so
there's<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.869> link<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.799> description<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.460> a

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
how to get a good connection to the host

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.600 
how to get a good connection to the host
so<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:34.860> thought<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.130> was<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> pretty<00:01:35.460> good

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
so so I thought that was a pretty good

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.800 
so so I thought that was a pretty good

on<00:01:37.110> machinima<00:01:37.530> respawn<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.430> think<00:01:38.640> that

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
on machinima respawn and I think that

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.280 
on machinima respawn and I think that
you'll<00:01:38.939> like<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.450> this<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:39.960> just<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
you'll like it so this is just the

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.960 
you'll like it so this is just the
shortest<00:01:40.530> game<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.860> had<00:01:40.979> on<00:01:41.100> my<00:01:41.189> harddrive<00:01:41.460> so

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
shortest game I had on my harddrive so

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.450 
shortest game I had on my harddrive so
that<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.119> could<00:01:42.299> do<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.390> little<00:01:42.509> update<00:01:42.720> and

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
that I could do a little update and

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.720 
that I could do a little update and
there<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.090> hope<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.420> enjoyed
