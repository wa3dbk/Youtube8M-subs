00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
like got like a challenge and

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.580 
like got like a challenge and
I<00:01:08.860> think<00:01:09.510> 450<00:01:10.510> still<00:01:10.930> a<00:01:11.200> challenge<00:01:11.440> speak<00:01:11.980> like

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
I think 450 still a challenge speak like

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.870 
I think 450 still a challenge speak like
yeah<00:01:14.590> you<00:01:14.650> know<00:01:16.200> it's<00:01:17.200> a<00:01:17.680> little<00:01:17.920> hard<00:01:18.130> one

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
yeah you know it's a little hard one

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.820 
yeah you know it's a little hard one
with<00:01:19.030> or<00:01:19.150> the<00:01:19.210> right<00:01:19.360> arm<00:01:19.570> so<00:01:19.930> trying<00:01:20.620> to<00:01:20.650> find

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
with or the right arm so trying to find

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
with or the right arm so trying to find
a<00:01:20.920> lot<00:01:21.070> of<00:01:21.100> stuff<00:01:21.340> that<00:01:22.090> works<00:01:22.300> what<00:01:22.690> doesn't<00:01:22.870> I

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
a lot of stuff that works what doesn't I

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.510 
a lot of stuff that works what doesn't I
think<00:01:24.850> we've<00:01:25.180> got<00:01:25.360> a<00:01:25.390> pretty<00:01:25.570> good<00:01:25.690> set<00:01:25.930> up<00:01:26.020> now

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
think we've got a pretty good set up now

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.030 
think we've got a pretty good set up now
I'm<00:01:27.520> still<00:01:27.820> of<00:01:28.030> kinks<00:01:28.960> and<00:01:29.200> things<00:01:29.710> to<00:01:29.890> work

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
I'm still of kinks and things to work

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.660 
I'm still of kinks and things to work
out<00:01:30.250> I<00:01:30.520> think<00:01:31.800> a<00:01:32.800> little<00:01:33.250> a<00:01:33.370> little<00:01:33.520> more

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
out I think a little a little more

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.750 
out I think a little a little more
guessing<00:01:34.360> test<00:01:34.630> and<00:01:34.990> like<00:01:35.470> we'll<00:01:35.620> be<00:01:35.650> good

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
guessing test and like we'll be good

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.320 
guessing test and like we'll be good
I<00:01:37.850> think<00:01:38.660> would<00:01:39.530> help<00:01:39.850> with<00:01:40.850> some<00:01:41.000> companies

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
I think would help with some companies

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.610 
I think would help with some companies
out<00:01:41.450> there<00:01:41.480> I<00:01:41.690> think<00:01:41.810> I<00:01:42.050> can<00:01:42.200> really<00:01:42.290> get<00:01:42.440> good

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
out there I think I can really get good

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.520 
out there I think I can really get good
stuff<00:01:42.800> and<00:01:42.920> get<00:01:43.040> a<00:01:43.070> lot<00:01:43.220> faster<00:01:43.640> than<00:01:43.670> its<00:01:43.940> so

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
stuff and get a lot faster than its so

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.050 
stuff and get a lot faster than its so
said<00:01:45.530> just<00:01:45.740> training<00:01:46.100> as<00:01:46.220> hard<00:01:46.400> as<00:01:46.490> I<00:01:46.580> can<00:01:46.640> and

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
said just training as hard as I can and

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.450 
said just training as hard as I can and
I<00:01:47.330> think<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.590> more<00:01:48.770> time<00:01:48.950> of<00:01:49.040> the<00:01:49.100> bike<00:01:49.250> the

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
I think the more time of the bike the

00:01:49.460 --> 00:02:01.560 
I think the more time of the bike the
better<00:01:49.640> and<00:01:50.950> yeah<00:01:51.950> it<00:01:52.460> was<00:01:52.580> awesome

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.800 

a<00:02:05.220> really<00:02:06.220> really<00:02:06.250> great<00:02:06.550> family<00:02:06.820> support<00:02:07.060> you

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
a really really great family support you

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.719 
a really really great family support you
know<00:02:07.930> my<00:02:08.229> mom<00:02:08.440> and<00:02:08.470> dad<00:02:08.649> I've<00:02:08.979> been<00:02:09.429> you<00:02:09.640> know

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
know my mom and dad I've been you know

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.090 
know my mom and dad I've been you know
pretty<00:02:10.030> much<00:02:10.209> back<00:02:10.990> me<00:02:11.230> up<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.440> whole<00:02:11.590> way<00:02:11.740> and

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
pretty much back me up the whole way and

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.160 
pretty much back me up the whole way and
where<00:02:12.610> they<00:02:12.670> know<00:02:12.790> without<00:02:13.060> them<00:02:13.240> I<00:02:13.840> think

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
where they know without them I think

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.410 
where they know without them I think
it'd<00:02:14.410> be<00:02:14.440> a<00:02:14.530> lot<00:02:14.680> harder<00:02:14.800> without<00:02:14.950> them<00:02:15.420> you

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
it'd be a lot harder without them you

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.570 
it'd be a lot harder without them you
know<00:02:16.480> they<00:02:16.690> my<00:02:17.200> dad's<00:02:17.440> super<00:02:17.860> supportive<00:02:18.340> and

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
know they my dad's super supportive and

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.850 
know they my dad's super supportive and
