00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:03.450
 electricity price 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.919
 in Veldhoven and the motorcycle club there on site 

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:08.939
 what a really fantastic course 

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:10.170
 it's the second day 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.649
 half past seven in the morning 

00:00:11.649 --> 00:00:15.079
 jensen work all present 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:17.609
 it is the first time that all drivers 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.579
 will start in one part at the same time 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:23.210
 because in the beach race the mass sprint is natural 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.210
 one of the nicest and most spectacular parts 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:28.919
 everyone is tense 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.689
 and we know that kyoto is not the little european champion he is going to 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.059
 lead in the general classification but will be the Dutch and the Belgians 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.000
 then be able to sleep 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.290
 it is a bit awkward but with an iconic non-america song 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.550
 five with 17 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.120
 so sit in between 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.530
 and then in third place with those orange bells with starting number 3 stefan everts 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.080
 the 125cc world champion and when it entered immediately through the dark 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.340
 you saw that goal 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.580
 after the lead quite surprisingly with number five tommy smith 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.880
 as a world champion and 19 9 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.880
 it was the second in the american championship in 88 and 89 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.190
 he was the fourth and he takes the first place against the ground 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.830
 behind 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:09.820
 and kidney foundation 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.310
 what it looks like when sitting on his motorcycle 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.130
 rob van heeswijk is our from a cameraman 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.200
 Silvio who is a leader in the rankings but has here on the seventh 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.409
 place that means 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:21.900
 tom dice among others 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.360
 can move on 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.360
 according to the Americans merit to stay in the lead 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.000
 in fifth place but then became nineteen 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.920
 a very strong Belgian 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.600
 schmidt in the lead and bucket the new plate b 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.310
 they resemble each other for a second reason 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.430
 new machines 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.430
 but it takes them apart because I was with a code orange 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.270
 has the yellow of the number five 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.900
 and edwards has number three 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.650
 both to look up 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.780
 the supporters in third place when the bankers in the picture 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.960
 stupid things last year a difficult season because of many injuries but 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.430
 I also don't have about halfway through the season 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.480
 wash if you don't 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.600
 injured but could easily become champion through evers 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.890
 fantastic motorcyclists all 2 and we will have a lot this coming season too 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.300
 of these two men 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.300
 only they will ride the 250cc next year 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.089
 along the water from the beach 

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:21.569
 if you are not used to stand driving that is really very heavy 

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:23.209
 such a place 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.209
 one of the hungarians 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.889
 and part button 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:33.339
 one of the australians also just outside the track 

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:36.419
 and then the world of fisherman the Dutchman in fourth place 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:40.459
 behind him marnicq bervoets took the belgian in fifth place peter johansson 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.199
 it swept in sixth place 

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:45.539
 especially 21 but you got us the american during your time 

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:48.649
 it is seventh in the general classification but I do not think in the 

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:52.229
 beach race at the back also klaus newest in particular six danes 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.759
 the legs are particularly good in the country classification 

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:59.509
 if these two leaders could indeed mean driving at the rear 

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:02.689
 that the Dutch can crawl forward the Belgian and Sweden 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:07.749
 james top the englishman he is now kyo who passed by 

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:10.329
 pioli 18 years in blue suits 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.329
 and the leadership in the individual rankings 

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:17.790
 Violinists intervene in places in that classification 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.569
 here the lead 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:20.899
 8 teus fisherman 

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:22.109
 he was fourth 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.609
 and bervoets and johansson go past number nineteen and number 9 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.919
 Johansson, who also has the beach race in Scheveningen this year, has a following year 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:31.919
 existed at that time 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:33.669
 the swissher 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:38.290
 tries to make up for something but it doesn't work tommy smith is the first one 

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:41.899
 flagged and that means that one of the fourth comes in first 

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:44.219
 the general classification 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:47.219
 for the second and therefore limited 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:50.599
 how did it go 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:53.439
 blair instead 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:55.869
 I would like one 

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:58.869
 the researchers must manage that would only be good 

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:03.669
 and then the two Belgians will be in it 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:06.259
 a second and fourth place 56 work 

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:08.659
 it shows that in such a good condition 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:11.679
 2 to pass his mouth 

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:16.469
 If the parents have finished the trail in Europe that is a hit 

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:18.769
 the summer for five years 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:19.969
 delegate 

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:21.479
 ola john 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.710
 there came 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.500
 by something not this is the beach race and incident dutch 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.169
 a Belgian flag and carries in the rankings 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.430
 by this result less so the leadership of kyoto less 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.199
 they turned up to fourth place 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.419
 the Finnish is surprisingly third Peter Johansson fifth 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:43.389
 john limit there are not yet among the first ten in general 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:44.900
 rankings 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.800
 the americans led the sweden for the belgians 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.800
 and the Dutch there are five 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.680
 longer delay gent 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.680
 for me with bullets 7 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.309
 the hague part 6 before that they were worthy to the desk 14 

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:07.349
 there we go the sun sprint and 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:11.099
 americans have to sing this sport sandwijk 9 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:15.210
 so then 20 is side by side on one 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.110
 goalkeeper equal in this case 110 meters hurdles the land 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.319
 but jans with 21 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:24.499
 we are four a few that start 

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:27.080
 a continuous process 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.819
 van marwijk who has our way 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:30.289
 but the profit came from 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:32.339
 riders became somewhat suspicious 

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:33.620
 the trusted one 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.819
 and began to call the match leaders to set the left lane 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:39.710
 what do you do in such a case you listen to heaven 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.710
 the other games are going to play so no problem on time 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.680
 the American who is currently in the lead in the rankings 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.319
 London centimeters through that file its time 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:52.370
 48 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.170
 there are 35 points to get the second place gets 32 points that is not bad 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:00.919
 three points ahead of support from evers muscular wanted to be there 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:03.990
 hard for me this beer goes purpose of the mountain at its request that 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:08.379
 clooney ghosts 

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:11.249
 hence after the start flag is given it laughs it is uncertain whether it is favorable 

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:12.059
 moment 

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:16.969
 14 55 hundredths of which were slower than they don't 

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:20.829
 of the number 32 times that you think participant from the polling station 10 x second 

00:06:20.829 --> 00:06:23.829
 dutch team what is there 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.069
 and this is very well balanced 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:28.600
 nearly four thousand 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:34.050
 The fact is that 5 47 is just a little faster that he should be precise than do that 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.800
 smith and he seems at the moment 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.800
 only silky jody 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.330
 light man so that should be an advantage but it works a bit on the 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.509
 motorcycle 

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:45.360
 are being refused 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.639
 53 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:50.059
 With that he did not do that when it was Gerard Joling 

00:06:50.059 --> 00:06:51.939
 he sees albert ferrer 

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:54.180
 Yes indeed 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.550
 unfortunately not tasty 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.649
 I am very satisfied with that 

00:06:59.649 --> 00:07:01.340
 when there is one experienced 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.110
 a fall 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:07.630
 Normally whoever stays in the stand will see that you also have a good start 

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.819
 You are an important reason given by the government 

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:13.249
 vzw is rarely in good condition 

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:15.830
 were therein 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.590
 that is not all going well and both saw that the duo had a lot of possession 

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.050
 but make it 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:22.189
 from all these 

00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:25.649
 where the other specialists and the same game who 

00:07:25.649 --> 00:07:27.159
 that is very fast 

00:07:27.159 --> 00:07:30.979
 we are well prepared to check if this is our third decision 

00:07:30.979 --> 00:07:32.790
 part of the bvpp johnston 

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:35.279
 the temporary solution is in my columns 

00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:36.410
 that can mean that 

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:37.879
 not spent on the management 

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:41.979
 2 liters of iodine a flight together 4 Johansson fisherman falls to the fifth 

00:07:41.979 --> 00:07:42.629
 Place 

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:47.020
 first but that fear and gerard joling by his victory is at 19 

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:47.099
 o'clock
