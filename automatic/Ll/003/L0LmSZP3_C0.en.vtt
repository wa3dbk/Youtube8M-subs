00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
have seen my full review of these shoes

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.710 
have seen my full review of these shoes
and<00:00:19.560> you'll<00:00:20.130> note<00:00:20.310> that<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.550> really<00:00:21.060> only<00:00:21.300> had

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
and you'll note that I really only had

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.290 
and you'll note that I really only had
one<00:00:22.109> issue<00:00:22.350> with<00:00:22.680> them<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.519> was<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:24.029> I

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
one issue with them and that was that I

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.830 
one issue with them and that was that I
was<00:00:24.900> able<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.289> dig<00:00:25.710> away<00:00:25.980> at<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.460> beat<00:00:26.760> up<00:00:26.970> the

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
was able to dig away at and beat up the

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.929 
was able to dig away at and beat up the
outsole<00:00:28.410> here<00:00:28.890> on<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.250> side<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.760> right

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
outsole here on the side of the right

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.030 
outsole here on the side of the right
shoe<00:00:30.269> from<00:00:30.840> doing<00:00:31.140> rope<00:00:31.380> climbs<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.890> could

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
shoe from doing rope climbs I could

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.770 
shoe from doing rope climbs I could
actually<00:00:32.160> put<00:00:32.489> my<00:00:32.640> finger<00:00:33.120> in<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.360> hole<00:00:33.390> that

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
actually put my finger in the hole that

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.840 
actually put my finger in the hole that
I<00:00:33.809> was<00:00:33.989> able<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.260> get<00:00:34.440> out<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.370> thought<00:00:35.670> that

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
I was able to get out so I thought that

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.160 
I was able to get out so I thought that
there<00:00:36.000> was<00:00:36.090> gonna<00:00:36.210> be<00:00:36.300> some<00:00:36.540> serious

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
there was gonna be some serious

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.170 
there was gonna be some serious
durability<00:00:37.920> concerns<00:00:38.370> with<00:00:38.579> these<00:00:38.700> shoes

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
durability concerns with these shoes

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.240 
durability concerns with these shoes
the<00:00:39.570> one<00:00:39.780> thing<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.050> Reebok<00:00:40.559> did<00:00:40.770> not<00:00:40.980> tell

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
the one thing that Reebok did not tell

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.250 
the one thing that Reebok did not tell
me<00:00:41.399> when<00:00:41.579> they<00:00:41.670> sent<00:00:42.000> me<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.239> issues<00:00:42.570> was<00:00:43.230> that

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
me when they sent me the issues was that

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.790 
me when they sent me the issues was that
they<00:00:44.040> were<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.640> pre<00:00:45.090> mass<00:00:45.420> production<00:00:46.170> unit<00:00:46.649> and

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
they were a pre mass production unit and

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.560 
they were a pre mass production unit and
therefore<00:00:47.010> they<00:00:47.430> weren't<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.789> exact<00:00:48.270> shoe

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
therefore they weren't the exact shoe

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.750 
therefore they weren't the exact shoe
that<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:48.930> guys<00:00:49.140> will<00:00:49.350> be<00:00:49.410> buying<00:00:49.739> now<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.250> have

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
that you guys will be buying now I have

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.700 
that you guys will be buying now I have
those<00:00:51.090> shoes<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.660> I've<00:00:52.020> tested<00:00:52.590> them

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
those shoes and I've tested them

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.340 
those shoes and I've tested them
extensively<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.879> I'm<00:00:54.480> not<00:00:54.719> worried<00:00:55.140> at<00:00:55.289> all

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
extensively and I'm not worried at all

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.799 
extensively and I'm not worried at all
about<00:00:55.620> their<00:00:56.160> durability<00:00:56.489> no<00:00:57.180> issues<00:00:57.629> from

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
about their durability no issues from

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.229 
about their durability no issues from
row<00:00:58.050> climbs<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:59.129> think<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.550> kevlar<00:01:00.059> that

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
row climbs and I think the kevlar that

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.810 
row climbs and I think the kevlar that
wraps<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.690> shoe<00:01:00.989> does<00:01:01.710> do<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.010> good<00:01:02.280> job<00:01:02.340> of

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
wraps a shoe does do a good job of

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.149 
wraps a shoe does do a good job of
protecting<00:01:03.030> them<00:01:03.719> from<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.409> lot<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.619> wear<00:01:04.890> from

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
protecting them from a lot of wear from

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.250 
protecting them from a lot of wear from
rope<00:01:05.400> climbs<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.909> just<00:01:06.479> overall<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:06.990> think

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
rope climbs and just overall I think

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.050 
rope climbs and just overall I think
they're<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> really<00:01:07.470> good<00:01:07.740> CrossFit<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.430> three

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
they're a really good CrossFit you three

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.760 
they're a really good CrossFit you three

millimeter drop which is lower than

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.920 
millimeter drop which is lower than
you'll<00:01:11.369> see<00:01:11.520> on<00:01:11.640> some<00:01:11.850> other<00:01:12.030> nanos<00:01:12.479> they're

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
you'll see on some other nanos they're

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.630 
you'll see on some other nanos they're
actually<00:01:13.290> pretty<00:01:13.500> good<00:01:13.890> for<00:01:13.950> running

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
actually pretty good for running

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.340 
actually pretty good for running
surprisingly<00:01:15.330> good<00:01:15.540> for<00:01:15.750> running<00:01:16.020> they've

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
surprisingly good for running they've

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.830 
surprisingly good for running they've
got<00:01:16.560> good<00:01:16.830> tread<00:01:17.159> we've<00:01:17.670> got<00:01:17.880> new<00:01:18.150> rope<00:01:18.450> Pro<00:01:18.689> on

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
got good tread we've got new rope Pro on

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.990 
got good tread we've got new rope Pro on
the<00:01:18.930> bottom<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.350> actively<00:01:19.860> grips<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.729> rope

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
the bottom that actively grips the rope

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.410 
the bottom that actively grips the rope
they're<00:01:21.570> very<00:01:21.990> flexible<00:01:23.150> breathable<00:01:24.150> and

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
they're very flexible breathable and

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.570 
they're very flexible breathable and
lightweight<00:01:24.509> they<00:01:25.380> do<00:01:25.439> have<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> relatively

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
lightweight they do have a relatively

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.850 
lightweight they do have a relatively
large<00:01:26.939> toe<00:01:27.360> box<00:01:27.600> larger<00:01:28.140> than<00:01:28.350> some<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.710> the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
large toe box larger than some of the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.130 
large toe box larger than some of the
other<00:01:29.009> nanos<00:01:29.460> at<00:01:29.640> least<00:01:29.790> in<00:01:29.939> my<00:01:30.060> opinion<00:01:30.450> but<00:01:31.079> I

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
other nanos at least in my opinion but I

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.260 
other nanos at least in my opinion but I
think<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.799> may<00:01:32.070> or<00:01:32.280> may<00:01:32.310> not<00:01:32.670> be<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.939> good

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
think that may or may not be a good

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.969 
think that may or may not be a good
thing<00:01:33.329> for<00:01:33.750> some<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.229> guys<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.710> that's

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
thing for some of you guys and that's

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.649 
thing for some of you guys and that's
about<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.640> just<00:01:35.939> wanted<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.270> update<00:01:36.390> you

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
about it I just wanted to update you

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.690 
about it I just wanted to update you
guys<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:37.049> say<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.500> don't<00:01:37.680> have<00:01:38.100> any<00:01:38.220> durability

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
guys and say I don't have any durability

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.550 
guys and say I don't have any durability
concerns<00:01:39.030> with<00:01:39.210> these<00:01:39.299> shoes<00:01:39.509> I'm<00:01:39.960> pretty

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
concerns with these shoes I'm pretty

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.649 
concerns with these shoes I'm pretty
happy<00:01:40.770> with<00:01:41.040> them<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:42.299> thought<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.570> was

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
happy with them and I thought it was

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.660 
happy with them and I thought it was
interesting<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.920> actually<00:01:44.159> got<00:01:44.460> a

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
interesting that I actually got a

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.660 
interesting that I actually got a
generation<00:01:45.149> just<00:01:45.720> before<00:01:46.259> mass<00:01:46.979> production

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
generation just before mass production

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.210 
generation just before mass production
but<00:01:48.240> at<00:01:48.329> any<00:01:48.479> rate<00:01:48.540> good<00:01:49.110> shoes<00:01:49.409> definitely

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
but at any rate good shoes definitely

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.200
