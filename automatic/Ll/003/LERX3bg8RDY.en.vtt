the banjos last major component is the

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.280 
the banjos last major component is the
resonator<00:06:46.639> without<00:06:47.639> a<00:06:47.669> resonator<00:06:48.180> well<00:06:48.570> just

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:49.290 
resonator without a resonator well just

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:52.100 
resonator without a resonator well just
wouldn't<00:06:49.710> resonate<00:06:50.449> this<00:06:51.449> resonator<00:06:51.870> really
