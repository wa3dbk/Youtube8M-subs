also<00:00:20.850> available<00:00:21.000> speed<00:00:21.800> so<00:00:23.840> here<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:27.439> so<00:00:28.789> my

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
also available speed so here it is so my

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.540 
also available speed so here it is so my

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
house is on my whole house this is my

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.120 
house is on my whole house this is my
backyard<00:00:32.730> my<00:00:33.210> house<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.719> on<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:34.680> can<00:00:34.829> see<00:00:34.980> just

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
backyard my house is on you can see just

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.459 
backyard my house is on you can see just
tube<00:00:35.399> comes<00:00:35.760> down<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.899> could<00:00:37.050> pause<00:00:37.230> they

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
tube comes down you could pause they

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.389 
tube comes down you could pause they
could<00:00:37.710> rewind<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.340> video<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:39.510> here<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.649> ok

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
could rewind this video so here it is ok

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.720 
could rewind this video so here it is ok
and<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.180> my<00:00:42.329> garden<00:00:42.750> for<00:00:43.230> my<00:00:43.379> house<00:00:43.730> my

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
and this is my garden for my house my

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.590 
and this is my garden for my house my
house<00:00:44.879> ok<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:46.230> my<00:00:47.070> house<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.280> like<00:00:47.640> 10<00:00:48.390> feet

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
house ok so my house is like 10 feet

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.470 
house ok so my house is like 10 feet
away<00:00:49.350> but<00:00:50.030> everything's<00:00:51.030> aren't<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.390> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
away but everything's aren't in the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.139 
away but everything's aren't in the
house<00:00:51.890> so<00:00:52.890> here's<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.190> choke<00:00:53.460> on<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.910> suction

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
house so here's a choke on the suction

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:01.010 
house so here's a choke on the suction
side<00:00:56.120> so<00:00:58.010> the<00:00:59.300> difference<00:01:00.300> between<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.750> vero

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
side so the difference between the vero

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.229 
side so the difference between the vero
speed<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:01.920> one<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.670> one<00:01:02.969> looked<00:01:03.180> like

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
speed and this one this one looked like

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.789 
speed and this one this one looked like
it<00:01:03.449> stays<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:04.250> that<00:01:05.450> stays<00:01:06.450> on<00:01:06.600> but<00:01:06.869> turns<00:01:07.650> off

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
it stays on that stays on but turns off

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.789 
it stays on that stays on but turns off
and<00:01:07.979> on<00:01:08.159> like<00:01:08.760> valuable<00:01:09.090> speed<00:01:09.680> when<00:01:10.680> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
and on like valuable speed when the

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.359 
and on like valuable speed when the
demand<00:01:11.189> increases<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:12.950> available<00:01:13.950> speed

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
demand increases this available speed

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.450 
demand increases this available speed
would<00:01:15.240> increase<00:01:15.659> also<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.470> demand<00:01:16.950> increase

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
would increase also the demand increase

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.020 
would increase also the demand increase
it<00:01:18.390> would<00:01:18.570> increase<00:01:18.869> itself<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.920> more<00:01:20.400> rpms<00:01:20.790> so

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
it would increase itself so more rpms so

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.649 
it would increase itself so more rpms so
you<00:01:21.420> watch<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.720> other<00:01:21.930> videos<00:01:23.479> to<00:01:24.479> prepare

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
you watch the other videos to prepare

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.780 
you watch the other videos to prepare
this<00:01:24.840> pump<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.500> variable<00:01:26.220> speed<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.640> want

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
this pump in the variable speed I want

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.840 
this pump in the variable speed I want
to<00:01:26.880> make<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.290> video<00:01:28.290> short<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:29.040> don't<00:01:29.579> make<00:01:29.729> it

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
to make this video short I don't make it

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.030 
to make this video short I don't make it
too<00:01:30.000> long<00:01:30.110> so<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.439> try<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.740> put<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.920> lot

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
too long so I try to put a lot

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.999 
too long so I try to put a lot
information<00:01:32.640> on<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:33.090> here<00:01:33.530> my<00:01:34.530> experience

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
information on in here my experience

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.819 
information on in here my experience
with<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.250> villa<00:01:35.400> speed<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.000> better<00:01:36.829> when

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
with the villa speed is the better when

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.210 
with the villa speed is the better when
demand<00:01:38.100> increases<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:39.049> motor<00:01:40.049> speeds<00:01:40.439> up<00:01:40.650> so

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
demand increases it motor speeds up so

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.789 
demand increases it motor speeds up so
keeps<00:01:41.820> up<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.360> but<00:01:42.899> it's<00:01:43.020> one<00:01:43.290> bad<00:01:43.470> thing<00:01:43.680> is

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
keeps up that but it's one bad thing is

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.240 
keeps up that but it's one bad thing is
a<00:01:43.829> 30<00:01:44.159> psi<00:01:44.700> you're<00:01:45.540> taking<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.930> shower<00:01:46.140> not<00:01:46.950> bad

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
a 30 psi you're taking a shower not bad

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.190 
a 30 psi you're taking a shower not bad
I<00:01:47.579> mean<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.939> haven't<00:01:48.240> take<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.509> shower<00:01:48.750> but<00:01:48.990> I

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
I mean I haven't take a shower but I

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.399 
I mean I haven't take a shower but I
mean<00:01:50.040> 30<00:01:50.250> psi<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.880> pretty<00:01:51.240> pretty<00:01:51.930> good<00:01:52.170> but<00:01:52.380> I

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
mean 30 psi is pretty pretty good but I

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.710 
mean 30 psi is pretty pretty good but I
never<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.829> didn't<00:01:53.220> never<00:01:53.340> put<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.700> PSI<00:01:54.210> gauge<00:01:54.479> on

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
never I didn't never put a PSI gauge on

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.709 
never I didn't never put a PSI gauge on
the<00:01:54.810> showerhead<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:56.090> you<00:01:57.090> know<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.240> don't<00:01:57.450> try

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
the showerhead so you know I don't try

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.410 
the showerhead so you know I don't try
to<00:01:57.750> keep<00:01:57.990> this<00:01:58.170> cost<00:01:58.590> down<00:01:58.950> if<00:01:59.759> I<00:01:59.909> had<00:02:00.090> an<00:02:00.270> amp

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
to keep this cost down if I had an amp

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.450 
to keep this cost down if I had an amp
meter<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:01.200> would<00:02:01.500> hook<00:02:01.649> up<00:02:01.829> this<00:02:02.070> I<00:02:02.189> don't<00:02:02.340> have

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
meter I would hook up this I don't have

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.119 
meter I would hook up this I don't have
for<00:02:02.759> meto<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.299> booth<00:02:03.780> at<00:02:03.960> fuse<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:05.869> many<00:02:06.869> ways<00:02:07.129> if

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
for meto a booth at fuse so many ways if

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.369 
for meto a booth at fuse so many ways if
I<00:02:08.250> have<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.580> money<00:02:08.610> more<00:02:09.360> money<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:09.690> would<00:02:10.200> do

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
I have the money more money I would do

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.390 
I have the money more money I would do
this<00:02:10.940> but<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:12.239> got<00:02:12.720> enough

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
this but I got enough

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.030 
this but I got enough
to<00:02:13.849> do<00:02:14.000> this<00:02:14.150> but<00:02:14.540> anyways<00:02:15.470> so<00:02:15.670> sorry<00:02:16.670> pumps<00:02:17.060> on

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
to do this but anyways so sorry pumps on

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.460 
to do this but anyways so sorry pumps on
it's<00:02:19.040> not<00:02:19.159> the<00:02:19.280> PSI<00:02:19.840> threshold<00:02:20.840> I<00:02:20.930> think<00:02:21.230> fit

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
it's not the PSI threshold I think fit

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.880 
it's not the PSI threshold I think fit
to<00:02:21.500> five<00:02:21.769> psi<00:02:22.280> I<00:02:22.569> believe<00:02:23.569> I<00:02:23.870> cut<00:02:24.110> it<00:02:24.200> out<00:02:24.290> I'm

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
to five psi I believe I cut it out I'm

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.559 
to five psi I believe I cut it out I'm
not<00:02:25.129> sure<00:02:25.159> to<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.459> minute<00:02:25.819> but<00:02:25.939> it<00:02:26.060> cuts<00:02:26.390> out

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
not sure to the minute but it cuts out

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:32.679 
not sure to the minute but it cuts out

but it is draining so here's this so
this<00:03:14.120> is<00:03:14.299> hooked<00:03:14.540> up<00:03:14.659> to<00:03:14.810> my<00:03:15.129> my<00:03:16.129> house<00:03:16.569> you

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
this is hooked up to my my house you

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.830 
this is hooked up to my my house you
know<00:03:17.660> I'm<00:03:17.750> a<00:03:17.840> garden<00:03:18.139> hose<00:03:19.030> okay<00:03:20.319> so<00:03:21.319> when<00:03:21.799> I

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
know I'm a garden hose okay so when I

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.680 
know I'm a garden hose okay so when I
when<00:03:23.840> I<00:03:23.870> choke<00:03:24.260> the<00:03:24.440> house<00:03:25.209> when<00:03:26.209> I<00:03:26.269> choke<00:03:26.569> the

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
when I choke the house when I choke the

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.479 
when I choke the house when I choke the
house<00:03:28.299> you<00:03:29.299> see

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.789 

so<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:33.390> poem<00:03:33.629> is<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.079> difference<00:03:34.469> between<00:03:34.530> a

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
so the poem is the difference between a

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.270 
so the poem is the difference between a
variable<00:03:35.099> speed<00:03:35.489> in<00:03:35.909> this<00:03:36.090> pump<00:03:36.450> yes<00:03:36.829> more<00:03:37.829> psi

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
variable speed in this pump yes more psi

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:45.020 
variable speed in this pump yes more psi
55<00:03:39.000> psi<00:03:39.599> and<00:03:41.239> it<00:03:42.239> is<00:03:42.569> available<00:03:43.459> you<00:03:44.459> know<00:03:44.609> you

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
55 psi and it is available you know you

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.170 
55 psi and it is available you know you
set<00:03:45.299> the<00:03:45.420> PSI<00:03:46.189> whatever<00:03:47.189> it<00:03:47.310> turns<00:03:47.579> on<00:03:47.849> you

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
set the PSI whatever it turns on you

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.490 
set the PSI whatever it turns on you
know<00:03:49.609> available<00:03:50.609> speed<00:03:50.849> a<00:03:51.120> consistent<00:03:51.989> turns

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
know available speed a consistent turns

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.589 
know available speed a consistent turns
on<00:03:52.739> you<00:03:53.010> could<00:03:53.159> check<00:03:53.459> my<00:03:53.639> other<00:03:53.670> videos<00:03:54.239> out

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
on you could check my other videos out

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.190 
on you could check my other videos out
so<00:03:55.319> here's<00:03:56.129> the<00:03:56.219> test<00:03:56.549> so<00:03:57.510> you<00:03:57.569> could<00:03:57.930> choke

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
so here's the test so you could choke

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.860 
so here's the test so you could choke
this<00:03:58.530> this<00:03:59.310> one<00:03:59.579> this<00:03:59.730> hose<00:03:59.909> right<00:04:00.030> here<00:04:00.180> you

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
this this one this hose right here you

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.550 
this this one this hose right here you
choke<00:04:01.170> that<00:04:01.409> and<00:04:02.540> turn<00:04:03.540> this<00:04:03.689> hook<00:04:03.989> turn<00:04:04.409> the
