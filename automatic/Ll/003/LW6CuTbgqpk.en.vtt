00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 Hi this is my 4th door today 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.660
 short preview presentation video 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:11.070
 since we are still on the ground in ewc 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.719
 of the acer mobile s 500 became accurate 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.679
 it's a mobile that is not necessarily 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.719
 a novelty that if it has already been 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.369
 previously announced but it was worth the 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.600
 shot when master hand in preview and 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.699
 especially well soon let yourself 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.869
 test it and put it right and in 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.490
 the tests in our youtube channel 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.449
 so today we're just I 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.310
 want to preview so it'll be 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.410
 relatively fast so we're on a 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.550
 phone that has good quality 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.740
 the screen and on the screen which both 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.210
 that bishop 3 inches who is in hd on 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.680
 which one I wonder about? 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.710
 that it's an added that they were in 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.829
 720 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.870
 but 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.339
 something else and what is a little bit more 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.750
 anyway not put 80 that's for sure 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:42.850
 it's not a full hd so we're just going 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.140
 watch the specs 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.329
 if I enter the device information 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.829
 are we obviously 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:54.199
 English is just one has a feeling to 1287 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.299
 that we are of course a hd hd ready this 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.530
 so called in terms of 

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:58.670
 Moreover, it allows me to make a 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.659
 little point on the specs 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.689
 we are on a mobile called 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:04.640
 500 who has a basic memory of 

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:06.259
 8 Giga internal storage on which 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.580
 we can say that we actually have 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:08.479
 about 6 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.920
 the rest is squatted by 600 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.259
 usual operations it's classic 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.869
 we have a lot of ram that's for the 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.369
 various information that is published 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.600
 easily in the mobile in terms of 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.640
 operating system we see it here we 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.259
 android 4.1.2 so we're on a jelly 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.420
 bean which by the way is absolutely not 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.140
 not absolutely not surprised at home there is a 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.039
 few officials 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.320
 additional additions 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:28.700
 on the part of acer on their mobile 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.229
 I had the presentation of 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.270
 features that skin function 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.440
 photograph and some small 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.310
 functions and that are very functions 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.770
 very light that are added 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.220
 of them also this exploitation of 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.690
 gas banks and android without coming 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.760
 excessively we'll say make it beautiful 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.080
 novel we are getting the phone stays very 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.690
 very fluid in use time it's 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.470
 besides a good point for the rest 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.479
 what can i say to you hear 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.710
 of the spectrum we are on a screen of 4.3 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.880
 inch of which was balloon company is going 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.020
 take a little tour of the owner who 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.660
 is accompanied by a microphone input a 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.970
 soulful voice underneath that on the top must 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.149
 his famous headphone grill we received 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.250
 the famous screen the three buttons 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:08.209
 touch of android are aghast 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.619
 the screen marking acer up on 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.020
 the left side of the mobile we find the 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.630
 micro-usb connection on the top 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.190
 find the button on off jack 3.5 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.780
 on the right side the control button 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.160
 or more - and on the back of the mobile 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.180
 the camera is a negative bias 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.410
 the one with flash led and one output because 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.330
 that that's it yes it's an exit 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.950
 are then it is written to say it I'm 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.959
 ask where is the other albi precisely 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.790
 because if it's a beautiful city in one 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.010
 whole world needs this chaos 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.660
 and yes hole and the other that's the same 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.280
 question ben me anyway 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.900
 here we are on this famous good lobby 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.739
 taken in hand it is very fine so it's 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.959
 very nice by the way he has a 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.100
 ma coating of back materials kit 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.150
 in a kind of plastic a bit of where a 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.160
 little textures and so it's rather 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.049
 nice peel the grip 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.880
 is rather nice it holds well in 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.019
 hand is nice we also find 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.549
 a little touch of design would have 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.660
 noticed with two limitation plates 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.730
 aluminum seismic aluminum 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.560
 by the way that I do not know about the top 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.800
 and the bottom of the phone to phone so 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.720
