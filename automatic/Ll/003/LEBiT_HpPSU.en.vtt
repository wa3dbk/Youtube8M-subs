actually because it exists right under
this<00:05:59.190> platform<00:05:59.820> and<00:06:00.210> you<00:06:00.300> own<00:06:00.480> stairway<00:06:01.050> up<00:06:01.200> to

the Tomorrowland Skyway station but all

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.270 
the Tomorrowland Skyway station but all
it<00:06:03.990> does<00:06:04.139> is<00:06:04.290> lead<00:06:04.470> to<00:06:04.620> the<00:06:04.710> other<00:06:04.860> side<00:06:05.160> of

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
it does is lead to the other side of

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.550 
it does is lead to the other side of
this<00:06:05.430> which<00:06:06.180> is<00:06:06.330> not<00:06:06.450> very<00:06:06.690> large<00:06:06.960> so<00:06:07.470> I'm

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
this which is not very large so I'm

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.440 
this which is not very large so I'm
assuming<00:06:08.010> some<00:06:08.160> sort<00:06:08.370> of<00:06:08.430> broom<00:06:08.760> closet<00:06:09.330> I

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.450
