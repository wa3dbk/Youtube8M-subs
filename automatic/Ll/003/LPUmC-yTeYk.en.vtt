00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
because the game has less bugs and runs

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.950 
because the game has less bugs and runs
a<00:01:20.340> lot<00:01:20.490> smoother<00:01:20.939> than<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.180> multiplayer<00:01:21.630> mode

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
a lot smoother than the multiplayer mode

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.289 
a lot smoother than the multiplayer mode
and<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.740> think<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.130> ugliest<00:01:23.610> bug<00:01:23.820> I've<00:01:23.970> seen<00:01:24.210> on

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
and I think the ugliest bug I've seen on

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.880 
and I think the ugliest bug I've seen on
single<00:01:24.689> player<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.439> i<00:01:25.530> was<00:01:25.650> playing

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
single player is that i was playing

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
the level been intended just stay there

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.890 
the level been intended just stay there
like<00:01:32.549> something<00:01:32.909> was<00:01:33.000> about<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.210> happen<00:01:33.329> but

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
that I saw multiplayer was that I joined

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.380 
that I saw multiplayer was that I joined
the<00:02:30.019> game<00:02:30.200> and<00:02:30.440> when<00:02:30.680> I<00:02:30.709> started<00:02:31.280> I<00:02:31.430> was<00:02:31.640> just

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
the game and when I started I was just

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.930 
the game and when I started I was just
falling<00:02:33.140> in<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.590> middle<00:02:34.040> of<00:02:34.129> nothing<00:02:34.370> like<00:02:34.790> in

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
falling in the middle of nothing like in

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.850 
falling in the middle of nothing like in
the<00:02:35.060> darkness<00:02:35.450> which<00:02:36.049> I<00:02:36.200> think<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.620> person

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
the darkness which I think the person

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.949 
the darkness which I think the person
went<00:02:37.160> through<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.400> floor<00:02:37.579> or<00:02:37.700> something<00:02:37.959> kind

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
went through the floor or something kind

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.569 
went through the floor or something kind
of<00:02:39.049> sucks<00:02:39.290> because<00:02:39.470> this<00:02:39.829> game<00:02:40.069> could<00:02:40.340> be<00:02:40.549> a

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
of sucks because this game could be a

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.819 
of sucks because this game could be a
really<00:02:40.880> awesome<00:02:41.120> turtles<00:02:41.989> game<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:42.500> it<00:02:42.650> still

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
really awesome turtles game and it still

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.509 
really awesome turtles game and it still
is<00:02:43.010> it's<00:02:43.519> a<00:02:43.670> cool<00:02:43.910> game<00:02:44.180> but<00:02:44.930> it's<00:02:45.079> just<00:02:45.920> ruined

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
by all these bugs and I really think

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.160 
by all these bugs and I really think
that<00:02:49.100> these<00:02:49.370> people<00:02:49.639> had<00:02:50.150> time<00:02:50.510> to<00:02:50.810> work<00:02:51.019> on

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
that these people had time to work on

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.110 
that these people had time to work on
these<00:02:51.319> bugs<00:02:51.709> if<00:02:51.920> they<00:02:52.040> really<00:02:52.280> wanted<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:52.760> but

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120
