00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
demoing this only on the simulator but

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.870 
demoing this only on the simulator but
if<00:00:19.109> someone<00:00:19.410> from<00:00:19.650> Apple<00:00:20.100> happens<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.760> be

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
if someone from Apple happens to be

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.810 
if someone from Apple happens to be
watching<00:00:21.270> this<00:00:21.390> video<00:00:21.750> I<00:00:22.020> would<00:00:22.740> love<00:00:23.460> an

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820

watching this video I would love an
invitation<00:00:24.449> into<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:25.019> developer<00:00:25.529> program<00:00:26.539> so

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
invitation into the developer program so

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.839

lumen<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.470> fairly<00:00:28.680> straightforward<00:00:29.490> puzzle

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
lumen is a fairly straightforward puzzle

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.970 
lumen is a fairly straightforward puzzle
game<00:00:30.029> there<00:00:30.720> are<00:00:30.840> only<00:00:30.960> five<00:00:31.349> parts<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:31.949> you

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
game there are only five parts that you

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.430 
game there are only five parts that you
need<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.340> learn<00:00:32.489> before<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.180> can<00:00:33.420> get<00:00:33.899> solving

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
need to learn before you can get solving

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.090 
need to learn before you can get solving
puzzles<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:35.870> let's<00:00:36.870> just<00:00:37.020> walk<00:00:37.710> through<00:00:37.739> this

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
puzzles and let's just walk through this

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.560 
puzzles and let's just walk through this
puzzle<00:00:38.520> really<00:00:38.790> fast<00:00:39.530> the<00:00:40.530> point<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:41.450> lumen<00:00:42.450> is

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
puzzle really fast the point of lumen is

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.529 
puzzle really fast the point of lumen is
to<00:00:43.379> light<00:00:43.620> up<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.829> checkpoints<00:00:44.820> on<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
to light up the checkpoints on the

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.229 
to light up the checkpoints on the
puzzle<00:00:45.739> so<00:00:46.739> we<00:00:46.890> begin<00:00:47.219> by<00:00:47.399> dragging<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.059> an

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
puzzle so we begin by dragging on an

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.819 
puzzle so we begin by dragging on an
emitter<00:00:48.510> which<00:00:49.190> emits<00:00:50.190> our<00:00:50.430> laser<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:51.829> you

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
emitter which emits our laser and you

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.850 
emitter which emits our laser and you
can<00:00:52.980> see<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.520> has<00:00:54.140> activated<00:00:55.140> these<00:00:55.469> red

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
can see that it has activated these red

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.000 
can see that it has activated these red
checkpoints<00:00:56.550> will<00:00:57.390> use<00:00:57.719> mirrors<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.230> redirect

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
checkpoints will use mirrors to redirect

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.950 
checkpoints will use mirrors to redirect
laser<00:01:01.460> but<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.640> has<00:01:02.910> not<00:01:03.120> activated<00:01:03.780> these

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
laser but it has not activated these

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.100 
laser but it has not activated these
purple<00:01:04.530> checkpoints<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.210> because<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
purple checkpoints that is because the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.100 
purple checkpoints that is because the
laser<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.220> not<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.610> right<00:01:08.760> color<00:01:08.970> if<00:01:09.720> we<00:01:09.900> drag

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
laser is not the right color if we drag

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.140 
laser is not the right color if we drag
on<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> filter<00:01:10.799> red<00:01:11.610> +<00:01:12.000> blue<00:01:12.350> equals<00:01:13.350> purple<00:01:13.740> and

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
on a filter red + blue equals purple and

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.760 
on a filter red + blue equals purple and
so<00:01:15.150> now<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.540> activated<00:01:16.140> both<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.530> red<00:01:16.740> and

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
so now it is activated both the red and

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.330 
so now it is activated both the red and
the<00:01:17.009> purple<00:01:17.509> checkpoints<00:01:18.890> another<00:01:19.890> mirror

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
the purple checkpoints another mirror

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.660 
the purple checkpoints another mirror
and<00:01:23.570> another<00:01:24.570> filter<00:01:25.070> will<00:01:26.070> activate<00:01:26.460> the

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
and another filter will activate the

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.940 
and another filter will activate the
white<00:01:26.820> checkpoints<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:27.990> we<00:01:28.500> have<00:01:28.619> completed

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
white checkpoints and we have completed

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.620 
white checkpoints and we have completed
our<00:01:29.220> puzzle<00:01:31.100> this<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> very<00:01:32.549> simple<00:01:33.119> puzzle

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
our puzzle this is a very simple puzzle

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.700 
our puzzle this is a very simple puzzle
of<00:01:33.750> course<00:01:34.909> but<00:01:35.909> uh<00:01:36.140> there<00:01:37.140> are<00:01:37.259> much<00:01:37.470> harder

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
of course but uh there are much harder

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.840 
of course but uh there are much harder
