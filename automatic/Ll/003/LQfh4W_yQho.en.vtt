00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
the solid state hard drive you get seven

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.810 
the solid state hard drive you get seven
one<00:02:55.170> point<00:02:55.200> except<00:02:56.010> one<00:02:56.190> known<00:02:56.459> as<00:02:56.700> your

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
highest thing but so judged on your

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.240 
highest thing but so judged on your
lowest<00:02:59.760> so<00:03:00.440> graphics<00:03:01.440> card<00:03:01.709> pretty<00:03:02.070> much

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
lowest so graphics card pretty much

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.270 
lowest so graphics card pretty much
drags<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:02.850> down<00:03:03.709> wouldn't<00:03:04.709> really<00:03:04.860> complain
