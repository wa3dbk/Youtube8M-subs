 Hello everyone 

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:08.290
 today I will introduce you to 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:11.200
 changes that were made to 50 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:15.460
 so it's a replica of chapi it's 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.430
 bob lee so we come to mark 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:21.850
 skyteam 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:27.730
 so we can see I changed the 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:28.990
 rearview mirror the paint not nearly all 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.560
 in fact everything that was white 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.039
 original 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:39.120
 I'm going in blue metallic one can 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:39.120

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.470
 wing mirror 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.469
 rear fender the kicker 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:08.810
 handlebar levy here and there and this go 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:12.979
 so there is another kelis it's a 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:16.150
 site that sells parts for mini 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.150
 skyteam motorcycles 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.140
 so I also changed the fignon of 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:33.549
 box outlet 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:44.170

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:44.170
 here are the little burgundy I also 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:54.920
 original by a carburetor of 19 with 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:58.490
 a wine pipe and an air intake 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:04.790
 conical that we will not see maybe 6 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:10.009
 players in blue so 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:19.160
 on the skyteam on the dashboard 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:24.230
 so there are neutral turn signals there so 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:30.440
 that but the flashers here for the 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:33.160
 murder there the turn signals and where his 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.160
 troupe the flagship dish 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:42.030
 so here I started for you 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.030
 can hear the coffee sound a little 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.760
 there is also security on stupidity the 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.830
 side stand 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:52.690
 when we did not hit when she was 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:55.300
 put in text and the engines here you are 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:04:00.340
 so that may be an advantage but this 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:07.740
 can also be annoying so here it is 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:07.740
 there was also birth 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:23.200
 you have a small site to your m 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:25.450
 papers in France that you want us to 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:31.000
 withdraw I wanted to say also I changed 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:36.430
 the bootie cdi here I put a case 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.780
 cd racing like that here is the case 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:56.380
 tell themselves and what they are handling ignition 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:59.350
 actually there you have a gas gauge 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.060
 but month and walk not that's not it 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:07.270
 the top 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:10.590
 see there is support will need maybe 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.590
 you perceive 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:21.010
 have spent in your tank 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:23.980
 suddenly the carburetor and you 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.390
 can go because of that so if 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.370
 you win one day we will try 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:31.840
 to open your skin but if you 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:36.250
 hear a little shit is that it's 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:40.630
 more linked probably because of that I 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.400
 also repaints the luggage rack in black 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:46.380
 mast 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:48.970
 that's because in fact original 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.980
 a kind of chrome but which is damaged 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:54.610
 very quickly 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:58.660
 so I repainted and it's better 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:01.080
 with with the saddle that is black the 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.080
 tank 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.040
 I went around almost all 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.840
