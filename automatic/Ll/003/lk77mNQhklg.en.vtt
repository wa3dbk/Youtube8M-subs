00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
becoming Groot but I hope hopefully the

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.309 
becoming Groot but I hope hopefully the
rock<00:01:21.789> doesn't<00:01:22.090> become<00:01:22.450> like<00:01:22.689> doomsday<00:01:23.020> you

00:01:23.309 --> 00:01:23.319 
rock doesn't become like doomsday you

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:25.499 
rock doesn't become like doomsday you
know<00:01:23.530> I<00:01:23.560> can<00:01:24.159> see<00:01:24.399> that<00:01:24.609> but<00:01:24.670> i<00:01:24.969> think<00:01:24.999> the<00:01:25.270> rock

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
know I can see that but i think the rock

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.349 
know I can see that but i think the rock
deserves<00:01:25.990> a<00:01:26.170> bigger<00:01:26.409> role<00:01:26.710> than<00:01:26.770> like<00:01:27.340> a<00:01:27.609> CGI

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:28.359 
deserves a bigger role than like a CGI

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:30.029 
deserves a bigger role than like a CGI
character<00:01:28.509> because<00:01:29.319> then<00:01:29.499> that's<00:01:29.679> all<00:01:29.920> he's

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
character because then that's all he's

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.039 
character because then that's all he's
good<00:01:30.189> for<00:01:30.219> his<00:01:30.459> voice<00:01:30.670> acting<00:01:31.119> the<00:01:31.539> guy<00:01:31.749> has<00:01:32.020> a

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
good for his voice acting the guy has a

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.779 
good for his voice acting the guy has a
physique<00:01:32.829> like<00:01:32.859> that<00:01:33.249> you're<00:01:33.399> gonna<00:01:33.459> use<00:01:33.700> them
