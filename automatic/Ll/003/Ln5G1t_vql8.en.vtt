00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.649
 we have a recipe in the afternoon 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.649
 welcome 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.280
 for warm with our tasting 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.550
 we have to sum almost one in five 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.210
 dishes at 45 euros and another of 60 that are 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.210
 seven dishes 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.990
 to do this type of cooking 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.610
 and the best thing is that 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.390
 what you need is a raw material 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.740
 cool even to the public that is looking for 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.600
 this type of kitchen you can not 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.270
 cheat you can not give a thing for 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.159
 another because he knows he knows what he's going 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.070
 what looks knows what he wants sometimes 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.229
 Just look at a fish and do not open it 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.960
 just touch it over the skin 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.950
 and you really realize that if you're 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.810
 good or if it is wrong or very apart from that 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.850
 be cool you can open the part of the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.280
 Saga and the face is already red 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.200
 eyes shining very transparent and that 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.360
 that is already fresh but then you pass the 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.569
 hand over the skin and you feel it 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.759
 soft you feel soft but it does not work 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:51.000
 that has to be hard with the 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.300
 surface is very urgent and is even 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.400
 exposed that I started in Peru 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.620
 It's a Japanese restaurant where I arrived 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.300
 by chance with the luck that the 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.360
 Bar counter was attached to the bar 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:07.140
 of sushi one night accidentally missed 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.869
 a cook the restaurant butt and I 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.590
 they put to do 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:15.110
 make rolls look at this I like this is 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.500
 what I want to do a lot of discipline 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.440
 a lot of respect for your work for 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.080
 you do not if you end the 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.560
 is what you're going to live with 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:30.170
 cook can not be closed in that what 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.810
 he does is the only thing in him 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.380
 the cook has to go out and see what 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.650
 your colleagues are doing in this case 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:43.190
 go try and go see all of them 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.959
 those things you give us giving you were not going 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.270
 incorporating here what is called the 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.920
 gastronomic memory and there goes 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.920
 coming out the dishes that you have 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:58.280

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.500

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.580
 juice of a ceviche if I use the tec 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.700
 the subject of cutting techniques of everything 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.890
 that implies everything that a kitchen gives you 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.620
 Japanese because I can not do that 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.330
 add flavors from my kitchen 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.240

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.130

 we have here and always here of all 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.970

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.280

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:38.319
