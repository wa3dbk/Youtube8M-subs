00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.380
 but the case we have a great understanding 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.900
 sait on the subject of television on the 28th of 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.599
 October started again with the sky version 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:13.049
 those that football is the definition 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:17.280
 I realize a lot, though, simona 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:20.520
 I'm happy, I have it, I declare myself 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:23.880
 it is also clear also in plain text 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.610
 on the sky bouquet at channel 126 on the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.500
 digital terrestrial bouquet at channel 26 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:34.710
 and su tivÃ¹sat on channel 19 then 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.019
 I read that there is a great fear not for 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.940
 say clash between those that football and 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:40.620
 this program can not be in conflict 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.429
 between a 500 a ferrari at a racetrack 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.980
 in the sense that their visibility is one 

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:49.499
 generalist tv from the sky is a sheet 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.179
 white that goes that has to be rewritten has 

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:54.120
 started to flavio that I have to say 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:56.479
 column of bets he perceived is 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.399
 getting stronger in the reactor with tea 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:01.379
 apprentice and now we come and do 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.510
 our transmission weighed as it does 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:08.340
 what was called heaven first? 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.229
 goal husband sure here succeeds a 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.740
 center forward from the closet to say 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.369
 could happen in the golden days with 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:22.110
 Bettarini 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:25.890
 no we sheva and defender while alone 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:29.789
 tapped at home but say no indeed 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.070
 we are trying to do what it is that 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:35.960
 there Sunday afternoon there are 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:39.390
 so many opportunities for us in all networks c 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.840
 to have the goals around we have 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.149
 we have the highlights and of course sky 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.270
 it has much more to much more material 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.060
 I said we had not us who 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.229
 it is this exploit en route with respect to 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.359

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:57.710
 absolutely 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.780
 and always a common thread will also be discussed 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.030
 of other things however sincerely the 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.280
 football is much more present than soccer 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.540
 I dedicate it in a sentimental way 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.060
 sentimental football than football 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.640
 technician exists in sky soccer in sky 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.440

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.320
 exults inside the field without showing 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.000
 the goal or the same the same as 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.520
 say the limits that those who had the 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.130

 above all absolutely the space a 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.790
 say we will have many buses 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:44.090
 interviews and then goals before everyone 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.370
