my<00:01:05.940> second<00:01:06.330> thought<00:01:06.480> of<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.660> game<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.110> it's

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:07.230 
my second thought of the game is it it's

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.200 
my second thought of the game is it it's
like<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.410> mixture<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:07.950> imperial<00:01:08.520> settlers<00:01:09.000> and

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
like a mixture of imperial settlers and

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.050 
like a mixture of imperial settlers and
Terra<00:01:09.600> Mystica<00:01:09.750> now<00:01:10.590> Terra<00:01:10.920> Mystica<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.760> don't

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
Terra Mystica now Terra Mystica I don't

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.030 
Terra Mystica now Terra Mystica I don't
necessarily<00:01:12.180> think<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.780> place<00:01:12.960> like<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.500> but<00:01:13.770> I

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
necessarily think a place like it but I

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.160 
necessarily think a place like it but I
just<00:01:14.400> compare<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.300> enjoyment<00:01:15.600> level<00:01:16.020> you

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
just compare the enjoyment level you

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.980 
just compare the enjoyment level you
know<00:01:16.290> we<00:01:16.440> just<00:01:16.590> love<00:01:16.890> Tara<00:01:17.250> Mystica<00:01:17.840> okay<00:01:18.840> okay

know we just love Tara Mystica okay okay
okay<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.830> looks<00:01:20.040> like<00:01:20.100> Terra<00:01:20.430> Mystica<00:01:20.520> bits

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.440 
face it i mean everything looks like
tiramisu<00:01:55.740> hey<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.730> that's<00:01:56.880> fine<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.360> there

tiramisu hey and that's fine and there
are<00:01:57.600> some<00:01:58.050> mechanics<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.010> are<00:01:59.130> similar<00:01:59.610> to

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
are some mechanics that are similar to

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.520 
are some mechanics that are similar to
terminus<00:02:00.180> come<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.540> when<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.720> build<00:02:01.230> in<00:02:01.410> a

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
terminus come in when you build in a

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.140 
terminus come in when you build in a
region<00:02:02.370> and<00:02:02.580> if<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.700> want<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.910> build<00:02:03.030> in

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
region and if you want to build in

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.820 
region and if you want to build in
another<00:02:03.330> region<00:02:03.510> it<00:02:03.720> has<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.960> be<00:02:04.050> adjacent<00:02:04.350> you

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
another region it has to be adjacent you

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.200 
another region it has to be adjacent you
know<00:02:04.980> but<00:02:05.370> what's<00:02:05.490> cool<00:02:05.610> about<00:02:05.670> this<00:02:05.910> one<00:02:06.090> you

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
know but what's cool about this one you

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.820 
know but what's cool about this one you
can't<00:02:06.450> build<00:02:06.660> in<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.930> same<00:02:07.140> region<00:02:07.440> you<00:02:07.800> know

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
can't build in the same region you know

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.080 
can't build in the same region you know
you<00:02:07.950> can<00:02:08.069> build<00:02:08.220> two<00:02:08.340> buildings<00:02:08.700> up<00:02:08.820> to<00:02:08.910> five

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
you can build two buildings up to five

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.669 
you can build two buildings up to five
buildings<00:02:09.450> in<00:02:09.600> the<00:02:09.660> same<00:02:09.840> region<00:02:10.050> which<00:02:10.229> that

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
buildings in the same region which that

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.880 
buildings in the same region which that
is<00:02:10.860> really<00:02:11.160> cool

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
is really cool

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
the bowls of power to be able to do like

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.620 
the bowls of power to be able to do like
little<00:02:15.010> cool<00:02:15.160> things<00:02:15.400> this<00:02:16.000> one<00:02:16.270> instead

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
little cool things this one instead

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.360 
little cool things this one instead

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
allows you to invoke the gods by

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.210 
allows you to invoke the gods by
discarding<00:02:18.790> cards<00:02:19.500> similar<00:02:20.500> similarities

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
discarding cards similar similarities

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.100 
discarding cards similar similarities
there<00:02:21.400> that<00:02:22.000> is<00:02:22.209> similar<00:02:22.480> didn't<00:02:22.840> think<00:02:23.020> of

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
there that is similar didn't think of

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.830 
there that is similar didn't think of
that<00:02:23.170> uh<00:02:23.520> now<00:02:24.520> upon<00:02:24.910> first<00:02:25.180> glance<00:02:25.330> it<00:02:25.690> looks

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
that uh now upon first glance it looks

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.449 
that uh now upon first glance it looks
like<00:02:25.990> ariat<00:02:26.380> control<00:02:26.740> of<00:02:26.830> course<00:02:27.010> Terra

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
like ariat control of course Terra

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.970 
like ariat control of course Terra
Mystica<00:02:27.580> zarya<00:02:28.150> control<00:02:28.540> but<00:02:29.230> it<00:02:29.470> really<00:02:29.770> has

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
Mystica zarya control but it really has

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.380 
Mystica zarya control but it really has
less<00:02:30.220> to<00:02:30.400> do<00:02:30.490> with<00:02:30.520> this<00:02:30.760> game<00:02:30.970> than<00:02:31.150> you<00:02:31.240> would

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
less to do with this game than you would

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.810 
less to do with this game than you would
be<00:02:31.600> yeah<00:02:31.870> because<00:02:32.680> if<00:02:33.070> you're<00:02:33.280> concentrating

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
be yeah because if you're concentrating

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.420 
be yeah because if you're concentrating
on<00:02:34.270> just<00:02:34.990> spreading<00:02:35.380> out<00:02:35.680> you<00:02:35.980> might<00:02:36.130> not<00:02:36.310> be

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
on just spreading out you might not be

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.430 
on just spreading out you might not be
getting<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:36.670> points<00:02:37.120> you<00:02:37.240> need<00:02:37.270> your<00:02:38.020> cards

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
getting the points you need your cards

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.290 
getting the points you need your cards
will<00:02:38.620> actually<00:02:38.980> tell<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:39.489> how<00:02:39.670> to<00:02:39.730> get<00:02:39.910> points

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
will actually tell you how to get points

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.210 
will actually tell you how to get points
it<00:02:40.450> might<00:02:40.630> be<00:02:40.870> that<00:02:41.470> you<00:02:41.709> need<00:02:41.890> to<00:02:42.040> have

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
it might be that you need to have

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.970 
it might be that you need to have
buildings<00:02:42.700> in<00:02:42.880> certain<00:02:43.209> areas<00:02:43.450> like<00:02:44.080> you<00:02:44.560> know

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980

in<00:02:45.160> fields<00:02:45.730> or<00:02:45.910> mountains<00:02:46.450> or<00:02:46.690> it<00:02:46.870> might<00:02:47.020> be

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
in fields or mountains or it might be

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.660 
in fields or mountains or it might be
that<00:02:47.410> you<00:02:47.560> need<00:02:47.739> to<00:02:47.860> stack<00:02:48.100> your<00:02:48.130> buildings

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
that you need to stack your buildings

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
of the best ways to try to control area

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.949 
of the best ways to try to control area
is<00:03:14.890> through<00:03:15.220> your<00:03:15.250> soldiers<00:03:16.000> your<00:03:16.450> soldiers

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
what I like about it is that you're not

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.949 
what I like about it is that you're not
just<00:03:18.400> placing<00:03:18.970> them<00:03:19.060> on<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:19.239> board<00:03:19.480> and<00:03:19.720> they

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
just placing them on the board and they

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.930 
just placing them on the board and they
remain<00:03:20.290> in<00:03:20.440> that<00:03:20.560> one<00:03:20.769> spot<00:03:20.799> you're<00:03:21.700> always

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
remain in that one spot you're always

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.120

isn't<00:03:43.690> area<00:03:44.260> control<00:03:44.620> necessarily<00:03:45.220> but<00:03:45.370> it's

isn't area control necessarily but it's

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.449 
isn't area control necessarily but it's
probably<00:03:45.790> resource<00:03:46.510> management<00:03:46.959> because<00:03:47.650> you

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
probably resource management because you

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.370 
probably resource management because you
know<00:03:48.579> hand<00:03:48.820> management<00:03:49.450> is<00:03:49.690> a<00:03:49.720> big<00:03:50.079> part<00:03:50.320> of

that<00:05:20.990> when<00:05:21.169> you<00:05:21.320> construct<00:05:21.650> a<00:05:21.949> building<00:05:22.099> you

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
that when you construct a building you

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.770 
that when you construct a building you
lay<00:05:22.610> the<00:05:22.789> car<00:05:23.000> down<00:05:23.210> and<00:05:23.419> you're<00:05:23.509> able<00:05:23.630> to

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
lay the car down and you're able to

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.930 
lay the car down and you're able to
perform<00:05:24.080> the<00:05:24.289> action<00:05:24.620> on<00:05:24.680> that<00:05:24.740> car<00:05:25.159> but<00:05:25.849> it

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
perform the action on that car but it

perform the action on that car but it
doesn't<00:05:26.270> just<00:05:26.449> end<00:05:26.570> there<00:05:26.750> because<00:05:27.199> once<00:05:27.860> you

00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:28.159 
doesn't just end there because once you

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:31.149 
doesn't just end there because once you
construct<00:05:28.880> a<00:05:29.199> similar<00:05:30.199> building<00:05:30.590> you<00:05:30.919> lay

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:31.159

down the new card above the old card

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.310 
down the new card above the old card
then<00:05:34.280> you're<00:05:34.490> able<00:05:34.610> to<00:05:34.909> activate<00:05:35.479> both<00:05:35.870> of<00:05:36.139> em

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
then you're able to activate both of em

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.439 
then you're able to activate both of em
cards<00:05:36.710> and<00:05:36.919> then<00:05:37.310> it<00:05:37.400> continues<00:05:38.000> and<00:05:38.210> it<00:05:38.270> just

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:38.449 
cards and then it continues and it just

keeps continuously stachy and then what

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.890 
keeps continuously stachy and then what
ends<00:05:40.580> up<00:05:40.669> happening<00:05:40.759> is<00:05:41.389> is<00:05:41.599> that<00:05:41.750> you're
