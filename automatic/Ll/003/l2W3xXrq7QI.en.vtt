in<00:02:09.789> my<00:02:09.970> microwave<00:02:10.390> it<00:02:10.929> took<00:02:11.430> four<00:02:12.430> times<00:02:12.700> which

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
in my microwave it took four times which

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.390 
in my microwave it took four times which
was<00:02:13.120> two<00:02:13.330> minutes<00:02:13.480> to<00:02:14.140> do<00:02:14.260> this<00:02:14.470> at<00:02:14.680> 50%<00:02:15.070> power

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
was two minutes to do this at 50% power

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.550

thirty second

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.280 
thirty second
and<00:02:16.950> if<00:02:17.880> that<00:02:18.150> might<00:02:18.360> depend<00:02:18.540> on<00:02:18.840> how<00:02:19.050> powerful

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
and if that might depend on how powerful

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.780 
and if that might depend on how powerful
