00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:12.840
 since cuba is 8 it is under windows yes 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.000
 necessary that you have an aero design 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.470
 used to start cubase 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.580
 can 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.350
 especially in the field of audio and video 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.390
 but you often do not have video editing 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.859
 so not so colorful or colorful 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.960
 Playful designs I have for example 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.760
 By default, this is how it is with me 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.380
 run a windows classic design and 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.849
 when I try to start lucas 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.309
 I get an error message immediately 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.250
 I should please such a topic here 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.500
 So choose an aero design 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.720
 how to choose such an aero design and 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.910
 then anyway so that it is yes 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.010
 looks reasonably bearable , I say 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.140
 Now I want to show in the following 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.239
 First , I'll set a standard 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.030
 aero design a right mouse button 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.510
 here in the blank on the desktop and then 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.500
 on adapt 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.510
 Above you can see my own 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.089
 design what I had already created 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.300
 We base our standard design on 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:04.549
 Switch windows 7 base design now 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.320
 I'll be here for 1 euro 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:08.530
 we find the under aero designs there 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.630
 I'll just get the first one 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.619
 And then it happens a few things 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.060
 I did not like it 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.950
 and I would like to go back to the series 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.580
 after ab act the first is the 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.680
 background 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.479
 I just do not want a picture 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.850
 I have here now in my case 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.750
 times on desktop background 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.590
 and who then to monochrome 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.150
 backgrounds and who me here 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.869
 background from me reasonably 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.869
 appeals 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.850
 he annoys me already that I would like 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.850
 Immediately switch off below sounds 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.900
 his standard theme here was also the 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.490
 windows sounds again enabled the 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.680
 I disable the same time in the me 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.610
 do not select sounds here 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.750
 the next deep 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.610
 color I push the window now times 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.830
 we have a little bit over here 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.080
 this transparent glass design that 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.050
 I also do not like this window 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:05.290
 paint and scold now the times 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:08.220
 Transparency first off completely 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.220
 Although that has time 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.409
 so far not so bad 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:14.030
 Now I want to go in the meantime 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:17.799
 cubase will start the changes 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.799
 can also see directly in cubase 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.200
 cubase mid 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.420
 I am currently here in the 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.860
 Steinberg has me right after 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.290
 the start welcomes if I have nothing 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.700
 have set other and why it 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.450
 I'm here now the title bar 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.950
 with these glowing menu titles like 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.030
 unfortunately I can not do that without further ado 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.290
 switch off but I can 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.960
 a little bit by the help of the 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.820
 window color adjust I choose now 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.280
 a very dark one or a very dark one 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.400
 dark 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.280
 window colors 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.860
 background then i see this effect 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.319
 relatively little against 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.750
 bright window design and go with her 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.849
 with the regulator color intensity maybe 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.650
 even a little further up then 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.780
 this effect becomes less and less 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.280
 of course, it is now visible 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.930
 compromise which you have to go when 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.299
 basically darker designs 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.620
 preferred what in the area of 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:12.310
 music production or in the field of 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.909
 video editing is quite common then 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.190
 unfortunately I have to use this glow effect 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:19.810
 be content if it if for me it 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.879
 Okay, here's a lighter one 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.260
 window already lighter window color too 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.370
 then I can choose that too 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.530
 adjust that from this glow effect 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.350
 almost nothing 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.610
 I can see that for now 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.140
 example left with me 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.180
 thing that I have in connection with euro 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.280
 would like to speak briefly to go once 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.420
 out here 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.210
 concerns the advanced attitudes 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.650
 for the windows design and the achievements 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.200
 I'm quickest about that 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.750
 windows button + pause button so easy 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.820
 the windows button and the pause button 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.740
 At the same time press I come here 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.700
 in the control panel in the area 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.260
 system 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.540
 there I find the extended ones 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.360
 system settings and here I find 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:06.430
 under performance visual effects 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.430
 I'll go there purely settings 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.200
 there is a whole lot 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.420
 on options that you can still optimize 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.680
 should this Europe I would not 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.000
 that also has to do with the presentation for 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.980
 Cuba is nothing to do 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.430
 There are basically only two here 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.050
 really quite important tick the 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.800
 absolutely must be set with it 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:27.330
 cubase runs in aero design mode and 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.000
 Although this is desktop design 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.530
 So I have to turn that on 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.240
 and down here visual thiele for 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.950
 windows and buttons use this 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.330
 I must also let that happen 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.860
 now out of here like a bucket it is running 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.060
 then he will tell me immediately 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.310
 acknowledge a crash 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.410
 So the two girls have to be worn 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.880
 so that cubase runs with the others 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.130
 I can do that too 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.350
 optimize my wishes, for example, the mouse 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.520
 turn off the shade if you have something 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.590
 does not need and does not want to have 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.140
 everything that makes the design playful here 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.880
 makes window shade I would need 40 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.360
 not even years I can get out of here 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.830
 to take 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.820
 so that is all that ever 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.600
 worse and yes, too 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.610
 it depends on how it works faster 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.960
 performance and the computer and the 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.840
 graphics performance of my computer 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:13.080
 but I generally prefer such 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.819
 usually eliminate effects 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.379
 what you should do after of course 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:18.360
 You have your own design here 

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:19.949
 has created or optimized that 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.830
 whole store again right click 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:23.550
 click here in the blank on the desktop 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.620
 to adjust 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:29.000
 Now we just save the design 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:32.310
 not only muslim up to now 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.680
 my simple aero design, so to speak 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.639
 to work with cubase if i am not 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.439
 I can of course also 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.780
 at any other time again on one 

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:40.740
 classic windows design 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.520
 I change back to what I have before 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.520
 had already created
