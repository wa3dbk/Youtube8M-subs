 boxberg no asphalt far and wide 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:45.559
 but unpaved roads and paths 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.010
 ultimate challenge in the rally 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.050
 Sports 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.970

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.280

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:01.460
 gained such as evo acer 9 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:04.130
 instead of peugeot 207 s2000 carsharing in 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.070
 motorsport the adm lausitz rally 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:14.810
 at the same time conclusion and highlight of 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:17.630
 racing series of the year and this 2013 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.149
 truly exciting year already 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.330
 start of march at the rally pfalz 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:26.330
 westrich ice cold extremely changeable 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.660
 conditions a bordering experience for 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.060
 man and machine 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.020
 the viking rally late march set 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.450
 one more thing 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.149
 make snowdrifts and ice 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.950
 to create the pilot badly than all 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:44.289
 snowdrop and the world already 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.289
 first warm sunbeams expected 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.190
 also at the last stop here in 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.740
 the lausitz again extreme on 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.220
 both days it comes in the evening fiercely for 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.220
 the driver 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.430
 georg berlandy a role of triumph 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.160
 away 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.900
 because in the previous week an accident of dirk 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.570
 riebensahm and kendra stockmar 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.420
 reidenbach that out for the competitors 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.060
 for the title for overland that means that 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.400
 just arrive and become masters 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.650
 easier said than done for one 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.330
 pilots of the lausitz the first 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.310
 Scotsman of his career 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.470
 how great is the respect for this one 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.280
 the respect is already huge 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.350
 because there is enough place where you get the 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.630
 technology and the vehicle, of course, too 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.850
 can destroy and the brake points 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.250
 will find a bit of the problem 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.320
 be for me because the car is more 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.080
 weight and I think if I have 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.330
 quickly find our rhythm then we 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.550
 that a really great rallye at the 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.560
 Front-wheel drive vehicles are available 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.310
 final fight mÃ¼li joke against 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.160
 scheller 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.260
 both are fresh newcomers one 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.260
 has a recipe the other leaves it 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.010
 Just try to come up 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.550
 just deal with the others 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.780
 Movement sequences in the vehicle 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.150
 deal 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.440
 already when trying to leave the 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.000
 Although not fast 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.570
 but still can feel a sense of 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.840
 build this underground and easy 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.040
 try to respect but 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.750
 do not be afraid to 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.850
 I 've never had such a thing 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.769
 seen and yesterday they were the first 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.690
 meter I drove and are 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.549
 already things approached me by 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.070
 I had never heard of them and 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.630
 that makes us scary 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.650
 Sophisticated we look that we 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.400
 simply the best of the situation 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.400
 were 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:40.139
 lars mysliwietz has its citroen ds3 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:41.249
 r3 t made rockable and it 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:43.620
 is going well to commit 

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:46.439
 the Saarland at the front-wheel drive in 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.319
 front then but the rain the darkness 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:52.680
 early return to the service 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:56.939
 just went straight ahead 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:04:00.389
 a pumping station over but that 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:01.200
 pipeline killed and anyway we 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:02.870
 sat auto 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.180
 it only has face left and right 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.549
 10 penalty minutes for two exuberant ones 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.209
 evaluation tests the benjamin scheller 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.870

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.819
 the championship close enough 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:27.100
 this also applies to georg berlandy and the 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.970
 Appreciation of the German rally 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.430

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.600

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.210
 gravel specialists from Scandinavia 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.960
 and the baltic create an incredible 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.780
 pace ahead 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.930

 Rallye championship 2013 means, of course 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.940
 Georg Berlandy along with his co 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.070
 pilots peter schaaf celebrates the 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.500
 Rhineland-Palatinate its largest 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:29.960
 sporting triumph for us he has the 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:31.400
 season a gear damage and so on 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.470
 stuck in the snow viking 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.289
 sometime in the summer I was physically 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.990
 not so fit and then I thought 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:41.199
 I stop and we break the whole 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.100
 season from my team boss got me back 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:45.229
 worked up and for rally Germany 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.490
 then came the breakthrough and then 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:48.440
 but noticed we can still do it 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.139
 and that has really done now 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.330
 have incredible for me 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:55.100
 with two wins at the final drm 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.039
 runs benjamin scheller 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.600
 Fulda at the last moment on the master 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:03.110
 podium of the front-wheel drive 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:05.690
 catapults then it will be like that 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:08.330
 thought often today but had it 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.590
 this is really so is the 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.479
 really nothing happened we are 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.190
 have small problems with the gear 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:15.590
 so we are a bit scared 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.240
 have that persevere and if then 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.070
 so this whole load drops off i had to 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.200
 first my head after the 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.150
 target entrance must be on the last wp the 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:27.080
 Mesmer knock because he has to 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:29.090
 the emotions out and that's how it looks 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:33.340
 the final result of the german 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.340
 Rally Championship 2013 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:47.090
