think<00:03:24.949> the<00:03:25.040> point<00:03:25.280> is<00:03:25.400> that<00:03:25.459> it's<00:03:26.060> their

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:26.629 
think the point is that it's their

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:28.449 
think the point is that it's their
classic<00:03:27.230> color<00:03:27.440> and<00:03:27.739> it's<00:03:27.889> their<00:03:28.040> classic

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
classic color and it's their classic

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.189 
classic color and it's their classic
formula<00:03:28.940> and<00:03:29.180> it's<00:03:29.299> for<00:03:29.510> people<00:03:29.659> who<00:03:29.780> grew<00:03:30.139> up

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:30.199 
formula and it's for people who grew up

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:32.199 
formula and it's for people who grew up
on<00:03:30.500> Revlon<00:03:31.099> red<00:03:31.310> and<00:03:31.609> they<00:03:31.760> don't<00:03:31.940> like<00:03:32.180> a

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.780 
on Revlon red and they don't like a
change<00:03:32.629> I<00:03:33.019> think<00:03:33.769> that's<00:03:33.919> what<00:03:34.040> a<00:03:34.069> caters<00:03:34.430> no

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
change I think that's what a caters no

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.659 
change I think that's what a caters no
for<00:03:35.239> but<00:03:35.540> but<00:03:35.840> yeah<00:03:36.260> with<00:03:36.590> new<00:03:36.799> lip<00:03:37.159> stains<00:03:37.430> we
