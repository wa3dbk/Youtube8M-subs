00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:03.759
 Ladies and gentlemen, imagine it is a choice and no one goes there 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:05.800
 what he is there 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.220
 but Nick 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.239
 all life on pump 

00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:13.329
 Sögel is the WADA days in the elections in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Bremen 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:15.330
 fallen dramatically again 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.210
 And although in Bremen this time even the 16 17 had to be with 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.599
 it's a phenomenon all over the world for the people 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.759
 Desperate to vote in free elections in the year actually fix counts 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.909
 may and may want to vote may say most between 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.030
 that this is not least accustomed to difference 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.030
 whether you are allowed to vote or whether you have a choice 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.100
 the Bremen for example, they just gave up 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.100
 the SPD has been governing there for 65 years 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.160
 it does not seem to change 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.220
 since testators themselves end abrupt continuous rain as Gaddafi and the CS order 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.860
 64 years 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.350
 and this he lay the SPD even makes except conditional coalition has 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.820
 both with the CDU and with the Greens as well as with the Left Party 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.590
 each have their own majority in Bremen 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.330
 and except with the Left Party, the SPD in Bremen is in possession of the weapons 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.020
 all my coalition made 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.730
 the Bremer already had a big coalition we already had red-green the 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.430
 even had a traffic light 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.640
 the Bremer have everything behind them 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.659
 and we have learned it does not matter who the SPD greets her with. It changes 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.659
 anyway 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.330
 but pulled out the consequences outside 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.340
 it annoys with and the SPD has learned 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.659
 like Angela Merkel 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.990
 if you want to stay permanently in the government for Wales 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.830
 Coalition partner should not be too picky 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.310
 what's eaten is eaten 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.810
 that has always been a good about life motto 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.350
 and the results of the policy no longer 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.350
 our parties fight for their own survival 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.090
 with the one cured 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.840
 I ask you coalitions are from the voter who instigated compulsion 

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:14.399
 the political is preprogrammed her hole 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:19.539
 and the voters understood the Far East I have my God if we 

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:22.199
 can no longer determine where the train goes is no matter who 

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:25.119
 in the cab around point 

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:28.239
 also the outcome of the election in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.730
 Not so much interest struck Arjen's last pubic bone infection 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.319
 seals 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.349
 In Meck-Pomm, a grand coalition manages more badly than good 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:39.229
 misery 

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:43.449
 and there you can almost be proud again if there is still no 50th 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:47.469
 Percent of the population in such a poor country are ready for their precious 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:49.040
 Shoe soles app to use 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.660
 and to a choice to mountain pine their impact so exciting is the question 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.940
 what the idyllic bulk of education of force 

00:02:58.649 --> 00:03:01.979
 that the FDP even stay under three percent this time as it was one 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:04.939
 pleasant surprise Sammers times like that 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:08.969
 but as long as this liberal rascals have the death bells as a wake-up call 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:11.969
 interpreted 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.829
 I'm not big on how the FDP has risen so already on the dead 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.169
 weed does not pass 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:29.609
 and in the shortage 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.059
 in the absence of a real important topic 

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:35.869
 to his major customers all on the reintroduction of the NPD in the Schwerin 

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:37.919
 Diet fell 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:40.019
 yes, now completely under us 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.080
 if that is the only real problem, there is an urgent need for action 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.869
 but also to congratulate this state 

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:49.209
 Of course there will have the NPD 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.679
 Of course you would ban again in the morning 

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:53.549
 but in schools please 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.999
 to create Tyrol that has never been a recipe for success 

00:03:56.999 --> 00:04:01.099
 if you could ban stupidity stupidity and racism I would be 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:02.869
 the first of the bear 

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:06.379
 they can not ban something like that, they can fight it 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:10.260
 and there are quite hopeful signals straight from meck-pomm they look 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.909
 MOPO Corp has ended up being a very elaborate and expensive one 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:17.329
 expensive election campaign led Andrä FIFA gave in hope 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.789
 Many cities favor winning a low turnout 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:25.830
 always the small parties and despite this favorable starting position has the 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.020
 NPD lost ten percent of their voters 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.750
 you can be proud of it »I ask you the people are completely 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.750
 insecure 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.930
 The people are unsure that the piece will be the debt crisis 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.219
 Large part lives in low-wage sector with prospect of old-age poverty 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.120
 and all of them feel that I am him 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.800
 the perplexity of the established parties if then most of them 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.330
 do not overflow to the brown rat catchers 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.800
 That is an expression of the stability of our democracy 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.440
 will have to live with it that is a few percent incorrigible in this 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:04.529
 Country gives 

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:05.450
 then this one 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.680
 worried about this unappetizing brown 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.930
 permanently below five percent does not just push one way 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:16.469
 but who of us dare to Westerwelle want Rösler and Brüderle 

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:18.659
 to enter into the SPD or
