00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.720
 new bio production building 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.940
 humus is located in the former 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.950
 pig farms around habitual for 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.710
 Latvian agriculture picture 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.139
 desolation however there are people who 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.510
 trying to revive life in the countryside 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.850
 creating new industries one of them 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.670
 ecologically flawless production 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.960
 long-term plant growth stimulants 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.400
 humus is an organic fertilizer which 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.890
 rich in various nutrients 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.020
 substances necessary for plants 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.989
 plus its huge is that they all 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.690
 natural yes no chemistry no 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.670
 mineral fertilizers yes everything everything comes with 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.129
 nature pure organic substrate and 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.620
 processed by worms yes and in 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.500
 the result of course then sifting yes we 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.360
 we get this beautiful product 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.270
 which fully nourishes 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.670
 various plant cultures the basis for 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.920
 humus production can be any 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.379
 organic waste in agriculture 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.899
 it is usually a mixture of dung and straw and 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.390
 in this nutrient medium run 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.850
 earthworms it or red 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.939
 california or so-called dan 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.240
 the main grain should be moisture 80 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.729
 temperature is 20 to 25 degrees air like 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.610
 for any living living organism and 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.680
 substrate or humus which we do not 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.900
 it feeds here I am always processing 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.340
 I pass through the humus adds 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.130
 him their bacteria their 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.680
 cumin and substances that are 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.110
 the core value of this whole biohumus 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.000
 which is necessary for and plants to 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.460
 they could normally grow worms 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.590
 breed very quickly for the year 30 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.689
 multiple so the organizers of the production 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.299
 votes count for next year 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.610
 reach a decent level before 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.070
 five thousand cubic meters of cargo 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.680
 which will give them the opportunity to work on 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.170
 export market a need for this 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.649
 product is huge particular in Arab 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.350
 countries 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.939
 however, for this you need to attach a lot 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.020
 effort 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.659
 construction and equipment first 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.790
 Corps already cost 200 thousand lats 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.209
 besides to conveyor production 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.860
 humus developed special 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.000
 experimental became and adapted to 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.610
 local conditions 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.310
 but new enthusiasts to Latvia business 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.610
 We are confident in the success of our environmentally 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.740
 clean land is clean and say waste all 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.370
 more or less it would be a sin not 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.310
 use 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.080
 so that we can somehow something their 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.300
 land ennoble and on this and 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.880
 earn so everything lies only in 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.220
 thinking you have to try to fight up 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.350
 the end and everything should turn out latvia 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.120
 there are already 2 associations 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.240
 biohumus producers 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.860
 and as Professor Transfiguration spoke 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.340
 devastation really begins with 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.500
 heads 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.080
 but really enterprising people 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.040
 will always find a way to get out of 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.520
 the crisis is all the more so harmonious 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.040
 natural way 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.650
 nature which is created by nature let's say 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.430
 so this is but this kind of business he 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.350
 stimulates 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.360
 gives you inspiration 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.730
 carry out this work and do it 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.810
