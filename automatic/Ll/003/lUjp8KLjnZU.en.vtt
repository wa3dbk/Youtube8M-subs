00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:06.299
 in a new video we are in a new 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.680
 departure with the ims impact on the map of 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.360
 copper but today I'm going to bring you a video 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.000
 informative about the new dlc of 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.360
 supremacy you already know that day 6 comes out 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.080
 for xbox one and for xbox 360 also the 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.119
 new bbc which brings zombie mode and 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.680
 we are all quite equipped also 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.380
 we know that they have released a new 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.050
 shotgun as you see on screen which 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.199
 it would only be for zombie mode that launches 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.750
 lightning and so on and it looks like it's going to 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.760
 be pretty much the same then it's a 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.680
 great trick but good what I want 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.030
 comment is another little thing that still 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.030
 has lent us in any channel of 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.820
 Spain 'or that I think equal to 16 and such 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.160
 it has risen well, I did not know it 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:50.100
 to get a new weapon in this new 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.770
 dlc is not 100% safe is an information 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.699
 that I have read and that has attached of about 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.640
 as many foreign channels but paints 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.980
 that this may be true we are 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.330
 talking about a new shotgun for the 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.770
 multiplayer mode called box stick 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.380
 is a barbarity has been used in 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.110
 another step Judis and that as I say is not 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.290
 an information that is 100% certain 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.480
 they still have not guaranteed it but 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.760
 it seems that the guards are 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.540
 reserving ace in the sleeve as you know the 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.220
 another day if it was not yesterday they also gave 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.040
 information that they are going to take 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.400
 new models in the body raised it 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.750
 the video grows in fact I thought it super 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.290
 interesting that they took new 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.850
 models like legendary and that then 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.680
 are going to withdraw weapons although good for 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.600
 seen the weapons that are going to withdraw is 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.640
 that will not matter to anyone but 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.950
 good summarizing yesterday's video of 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.560
 believe is that they are going to get a new model 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.350
 of weapon that would be legend and you do not know 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.080
 still what weapons are going to get out or if they're going 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.280
 to have more damage or if they are going to have 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.820
 better characteristics than those 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.920
 they are elites but good looks like 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.810
 is going to be a super cheto I hope it's 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.729
 so although then the game as it says 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.920
 I think it's going to be unbalanced by 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.429
 complete but it would not make sense that 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.320
 they took out a new weapon model that 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.440
 call legendary that looks like a 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.570
 super billet no and that the weapon then was 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.489
 bad then I guess it's going to be 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.470
 this new model of 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.820
 weapons so I still do not have the 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.070
 pick and if they are already taking the stage 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.500
 but good but good but good is 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.290
 pretty funny, you know 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.860
 carotid warfare is taking off as 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:35.080
 the sleeve and is taking out weapons without prior 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.239
 notice practically with which you put it 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.010
 tyc is a weapon that has not yet been 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.980
 talked nothing about it but gray channels 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.100
 that if they get advance information and 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.010
 that are usually right have filtered 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.650
 in a way that I do not know if it 's at all 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.019
 true but paint to yes since these 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.390
 channels usually give true information 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.190
 almost always with which we will have 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.380
 efe in which this new beard will come out 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.390
 because I sincerely love that 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.900
 put new weapons in the so orphans 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.400
 to you but to me the one from 4 side r 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.260
 all these weapons that have been taking out the 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.910
 m1 irons I have thrown games with 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.040
 them and I had a great time with what 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.660
 which when they take out a new weapon is like 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.850
 a new toy to get into 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.000
 play public not with what I already tell you 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.230
 I'm very interested in this new weapon 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.690
 especially because of the fact that it's going to be 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.700
 an old shotgun and that puts me 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.500
 pretty good I 'll show you a picture 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.900
 of the new weapon is obviously not going to be 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.180
 exactly that if it comes out but it's going to be 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.070
 that in futuristic we could be 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.930
 talking about a gun with two cartridges 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.430
 with two rifles as you want to call it 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.320
 but good I'll leave you with images 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.019
 what could become the post and 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.209
 it could become cropped and it could 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.550
 also be elongated but always 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.800
 keeping both rifles or both 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.230
 cartridges as you want to call it what 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.650
 important thing about this weapon is that always 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.019
 will have two bullets and a weapon came out like that in 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.060
 black ops 1 in modern warfare 2 and the 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.350
 truth is that they were pretty cool in 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.490
 white zoom is true that I was not going 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.250
 too nothing but 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.140
 perhaps being a remastering of 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.820
 these weapons because they put it quite 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.440
 doped can not get to be 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.960
 pretty funny and up to here the 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.210
 today's information I hope it's true 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.100
 I do not know if you want to new 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.810
 arms was so guardian but I do as I 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.060
 I say I have a great time when they take out 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.010
 new weapons and this well then I 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.110
 always returns the illusion not to play 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.300
 those 23 days although always the two 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.430
 first days are everyone when 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.740
 with that weapon and lose a little bit the 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.690
 fun but after that to the people 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.310
 he forgets that there is a new weapons and 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.140
 you put it on and well then you can 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.940
 spend pretty cool and that nothing guys 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.560
 I hope you liked it I hope that the 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.860
 information be true and we can 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.480
 enjoy a new weapon in a few days 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.130
 I have said I hope you liked it 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.110
 the video if so vote it with x 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.290
 favorites for more greetings and even the 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.290
 next
