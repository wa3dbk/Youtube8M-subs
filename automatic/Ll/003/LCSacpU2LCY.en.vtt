 I have great good and religions get 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.349
 find for a new video 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.720
 here is a video a bit yellowish 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:20.310
 news here to tell you that 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.439
 I do not stop the videos of course I 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:27.660
 continue so here is 6 with a 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.429
 very worked video the gameplay if 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.390
 it's a little gameplay on black ops 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.089
 blocks 1 to the Galicians this is where I at 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.649
 ganil way this management of the ladies 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:39.149
 during the gap and I know more so 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.190
 it's a gameplay that dates back over 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.320
 three years so here to tell you 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.570
 it's really a gameplay when I 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.000
 was playing black ops so said said you 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.000
 really really from there in the game 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.160
 of his more than 125 he cold for 49 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.420
 go back like that one I did not want to me 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.430
 am not really digging my head for 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.920
 this video just what it is not 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.020
 a video with a specific subject if game 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.449
 for power can you say outrageous 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.979
 next video 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:08.070
 these are the reasons why I have not got too much 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.280
 videos and that's so all 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.509
 first of all first I want to clarify 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.190
 one thing will have to be why I have not 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.259
 so many videos just that me 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.509
 I know videos that you want the 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.060
 motivation since at this moment in this 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.929
 moment the following new motivated but 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.630
 often I will spend half for 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:26.099
 Ben videos here's actually it's me it's 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.599
 to leave the youtuber I love who 

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:29.880
 gives me the motivation to make videos 

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:31.590
 that is to say that during this month where 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.039
 youtube hours room youtube la cuma 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.590
 of video file motivation it's 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:39.090
 paradoxical hd so that's it's a 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.220
 hundred subscribers all the time the game 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.650
 knows this name 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.030
 normally he had 3000 subscribers so 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.330
 it was a rising gaming scene and 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.860
 videos of call of it's all but 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.510
 my hilarity because he could have too much 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.220
 motivation and goes out so they had it 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.650
 stopped so at night I continued his 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.690
 design chain so that's who 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.440
 is called parra design and android os 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.550
 and now he recreated so a scene 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.580
 in saint louis makes gaming videos 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.430
 so finally they deign videos we're going 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.020
 say on free games so no 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.380
 need hairston I do not know if you 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.940
 know 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.110
 it's really a good game so me 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.850
 I was going video room do that gave me 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.470
 also his words if they gave a 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.150
 really want to say play so like 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.120
 it's a day of joy that has become a 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.520
 little resumed with reference to hugo for 20 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.600
 people know one and that 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.590
 gives a little nostalgic side we are 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.140
 a little bit like you do 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.480
 duels against guys in multiplayer 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.550
 with your deck and all so that's enough 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.440
 funny so here maybe you'll do 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.010
 a video on voice it's pocket but 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.290
 why not so now 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.459
 he remakes videos ben me I also 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.410
 want to do it when it's not bad 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.090
 of ideas a world first 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.019
 I think you make leaders of 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.489
 league of legends so that maybe 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.450
 fuck a bit of my mouth because that 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.760
 almost a year 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.290
 a year ago from the fim kg that was called 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.700
 finally about a year I'm not sure 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.940
 but waddle days a video that 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.830
 was called a video a video call from 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.980
 video team / valois code 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.390
 in short then a video on call of a 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.120
 video on league of legends of my heart 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.400
 she said that like that it could 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.880
 vary and or not but I do not have 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.870
 all done so that's my case well it's 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.700
 not ready I did not have too much dirtied 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.950
 back so re excuse me I have a 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.630
 solution from my room was behind 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.600
 here we are so I do not know about him so 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.430
 I said you were saying oh yes why the 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.769
 video part code a video on lol 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.350
 it's my club with 4 biographical 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.760
 simply titled because marie 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.380
 Delay more envy actually dry 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.140
 after I had a little more taste playing 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.310
 to gta like to look trips had not 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.269
 I had stopped so here but 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.350
 now here I am really playing 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.720
 a lot to league of legend for me 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.820
 it's one of the best games 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.920
 simply exist before that this is 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.750
 had fun it's too good but if you 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.880
 want you can play so but very 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.450
 surely yes I would put a link in the 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.940
 description just for 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.670
 poujol so you have to download ya no 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.769
 Russia to nothing it's a good game really 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.720
 a lot of players it's really fun 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.840
 new fred only videos on his 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.569
 hand does a big tutorial a year that a 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.450
 big tutorial on lol dont tell you 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.290
 still the subject of the tutorial because that's me 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.690
 is going to be a little surprise 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.180
 during his tenure he will have videos 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:18.320
 surely with my friends so here we 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:21.269
 will be on skype this will make a video 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.130
 concentrates to a lot of bars so see 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.990
 almost certainly for the future 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.919
 only normal play videos where 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.520
 they would be new champions 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:31.290
 and all so we see there after lucho 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.180
 cissÃ© must first that I find a good 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.800
 software to finish a part because 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.870
 if they will hit it's all that's okay 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.740
 Going a lot happier than me and my pc 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.389
 it's nice maybe it should not 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.889
 dressed is not a pc egg either 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:42.860
 so if these keystrokes carries 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.910
 really realizes beef thoroughly so 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.270
 and then when I have found by jouffre 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.410
 and the videos on it here so 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.590
 the story with all the peeps and everything 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.060
 so here otherwise I had wanted to do 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.950
 what else ah yes you may have it 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.530
 do you a little video so on my 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:01.560
 passions so simply so 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.330
 still an interruption of our mothers our 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.389
 masses man good it does not matter that I 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.500
 understand his voice at the editing waving 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:10.919
 to say that I wanted to make a video 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.389
 on my passions wang why you me 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.130
 know a little better 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:16.590
 no I have a lot of passion so wanted 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.669
 to say is very good for people who 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.160
 say yes we do not care of your life you 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:25.110
 see the video its facet a lot we are going 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:26.490
 to say here and as he says who will have 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.320
 only still videos on gta so 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.180
 with us + therefore this is particularly 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.530
 really reduced jelassi young woman is 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.450
 one of the cooked salem of several 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.919
 beautiful even if several regulars because 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.800
 that we play a lot and five dead in 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:39.060
 this time there too much but it's okay 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.200
 come back then they were going to play 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.810
 fally last two months had 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.460
 hugely played at gta we really said 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.750
 qe like pigs no I will make you 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.729
 only 20 places under the tables 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.710
 that five in l1 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:51.950
 so he's what my shot if your 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.550
 conclusion inevitably on the live here 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.190
 I will make you perhaps 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.720
 presentations of 1000 cars stuff 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.250
 so we see that it's going to be 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.120
 it's okay and that's normally fine yeah to 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:05.040
 sure the world m and that's it again 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.270
 ballads whose video is to say that 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.920
 the finished my wing as lasted six 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.510
 minutes so the gameplay 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:13.260
 the young and still that one of a mega 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:16.110
 I was going to the net here and then it's okay 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.130
 quickly you actress m so my prose 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.620
 opponents who know the parents have 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.360
 divorced so last October and they 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:24.240
 have divorced and so now 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.040
 a month my mother and my father are going to say 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.200
 but we will move 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.430
 so we'll just move 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.790
 beating quite accurate in an apartment 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.840
 and so head I thought to redo you to 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.430
 this work of which perhaps for the 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.950
 1000 subscribers because we are almost at 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:40.350
 800 or so like that up to 70 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:41.730
 we will say 2.0 I show you my room 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.860
 of new love finally bring us 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.990
 see everywhere everywhere here so this 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.120
 would be a weekend on two if my dad 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.560
 and so suddenly all that is enough 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:53.640
 pleasure and it will be at my mother's house that wants 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:55.590
 jesus would slip more often that's it 

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.230
 Well, that will be done in 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.340
 mom and then so voila when a 

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.130
 class g it's a little bit all really 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.270
 also mocks for the gameplay 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:05.040
 because I tried to make dense 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:06.210
 ouargla like that because before a friend 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.490
 who simon we did a little bit a 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:10.080
 little peton bet on munich still has 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:13.229
 online in domination and all so that 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.970
 it's nice and that's why I say
