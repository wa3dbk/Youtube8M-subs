00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.139
 good and welcome to the tasting channel 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.730
 I think we're here in a new video 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.500
 full of news and especially of 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.869
 spoilers in which we will see the 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.490
 new displacements of sk telecom which 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.770
 you are looking at the loading screen 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.630
 as for example jacks leasing zaira 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.519
 and bein we're also going to see the new ones 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.839
 displacements of Atlantean sintra and tweets 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.669
 that we knew that they would receive the 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:28.800
 true that they are very handsome and we will see 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:30.329
 then also at the end a 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.880
 small new section that is only going to 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:34.650
 be during the event of the ix packs of 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.900
 2014 a section in which we are going to 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.670
 review the exterminator twitch skin 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.800
 a skin they are performing live 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.359
 through the event and we will see a spoiler 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.770
 from a pretty well-known image in the 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:45.870
 channel that has come out in enough 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.329
 move and that I think I should give a lot 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.260
 game you know you can go directly to 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.879
 the news that interests you most 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.649
 using the notes of the bar 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.480
 from above and let's start directly 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.800
 by sk sp splash good telecom 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.300
 here we are seeing these squares the 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.010
 truth is that as I have been saying 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.899
 for quite some time moving 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.449
 convinces many times more than what they are 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.309
 the skins within the game for example 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.870
 jacques fijaros the set there is no 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.430
 nothing wrong the center of the game yes that 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.409
 it changes quite this idea is still 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.000
 one of my favorites to tell you and 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.960
 also before anything good you are 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.940
 looking at the image 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.860
 very pretty is very currada style 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.210
 type assassin the five together already 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.860
 you are watching but there is also a 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.690
 small spoiler in which we have 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.550
 given almost everyone counts because it is 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.110
 quite remarkable in the audience too 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.840
 you told me enough of you 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.400
 see if we expand it a little bit and we 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.500
 we center order that image on the species 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.270
 of champion or of person who is 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.640
 retransmitting can also be a 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.560
 homage to the caster I do not know but yes 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.880
 that is true that good if we 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.619
 we look at the rest of the audience is not 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.600
 so as defined as how is the 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.000
 character we see that has a top has 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.550
 Some micros may be a future champion 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.770
 a skin of james I do not know we'll be at 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.479
 so much but good tell me you what 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.890
 it seems and what do you think it is going to be a 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.840
 new champion a new skin or 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.820
 it is simply a mere drawing a 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.530
 homage to the caster let's see 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.179
 now the splash are from sintra atlante 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.860
 well the truth is that the squares of 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:03.869
 syndrome seems incredible it seems to me 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.789
 10 yes that inside the game I would give a 6 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.259
 as much and more than anything because it has 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.030
 those water particles that are enough for me 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.500
 they like it, but go 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.239
 imagine yourself in the game with these 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.209
 colors as vivid as it has to displace 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.980
 maybe rivers really can not include it 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.989
 inside the game because they can not 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.319
 graphic engine by game quality in 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.180
 yes 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.230
 I do not know or do not have the means, I think 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.969
 that if they have them because they have done 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.769
 very bright champions and with some 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:27.269
 very bright colors because they can not 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.790
 do with no back and we look inside 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.290
 of the game seems very stone style 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.760
 bluish not me not just convince me 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.170
 yes it is true that the issue of 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.060
 Atlanteans of the Atlantic I like 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.769
 very much and if it was with these colors 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.599
 I would buy it head but good 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.459
 we have no choice but to see the displacement and 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.500
 enjoy it so good let's move on 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.790
 to see directly the good twitch 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.129
 other plans that leaves me with my mouth 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.780
 open incredible twitch it seems to me 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.430
 amazing we are also seeing what 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.950
 the icon has also been the 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.419
 loading screen that will receive the new 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.310
 visual improvement of tweets and tell you that 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:58.139
 we still do not have to displace new ones from 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.629
 the secondary skins as it happens with 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:01.919
 garen heimerdinger although to his we are going to 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.680
 have to wait much longer to 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:06.480
 receive splash on those skins that have 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.760
 focused more on the main topic and the 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.889
 visual improvement within the game I have to 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.959
 tell you that splash ar are 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:14.340
 amazing as I'm telling you 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.689
 you will say is that you always like them all 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.549
 for the truth is that I do not like any 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:19.980
 because I also see the work 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.109
 one of these and I find it amazing 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.060
 how good we have that knee there with the 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:27.060
 harpoon prepared 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.470
 lavalle this berry and well I love me 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.720
 love tell me what is yours 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.530
 favorite the sk telecom without the 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.030
 atlante or twitch 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.620
 I stay where for the moment 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.630
 I'm with the one without dry twitch or a 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.280
 little and jacques from here technical but 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.140
 good tell me you and now let's go 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.180
 already to an interesting subject such as the pax 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.370
 east of 2014 good that better than 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.989
 start at the 2014 CP talking about 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.790
 previous topic of tweets precisely and 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.110
 good yesterday in the direct questions and 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.300
 answers that I made in the channel the 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.190
 video before this to tell you that you 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.040
 we show images or three I do not remember 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.049
 very well go tweet exterminator a 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.060
 live skin they are going 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.319
 to make the drawing let's move on to 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.330
 see it so you do not lose detail here 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.700
 we have three images of what is the 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.319
 process set the first of the 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.790
 left is not very finished the 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.040
 right has a little more detail 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.380
 and to the right of the whole we have already good 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.519
 Well with him what is the broken shoe 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.709
 velarde is that I find it incredible and 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.810
 I think it would be amazing is this skin 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.850
 within the good game from telling you that 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.919
 this skin as confirmed by riot in the 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.270
 event does not have to go on sale 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.400
 one hundred percent sure maybe not even 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.630
 we can see it but well I think so 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.880
 more than anything because the other year 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.410
 showed here lioness pool party 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.970
 it came out over the months of 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.740
 next so I have the 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.420
 hopes that if it comes out because 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.530
 it seems amazing to me and I think that 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.540
 over the days I'm going to show you 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.730
 also images of the network modeling in 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.530
 3-d and I think they're going to make a splash hoop 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.270
 paint it at least so I'll go 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.430
 bringing images thanks to the mobile 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.990
 the manager of the surrender page 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.600
 at 20 he is doing a great job 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.430
 there as a correspondent to say 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.600
 injured really has gone he and the rush 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.280
 who is doing incredible work like 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.440
 on its page surrender to the center of 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.060
 a link in the description you know well 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.920
 Well, let's also go to see 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.560
 a kind of spoiler because if we 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.930
 we fix and go to the next image 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.280
 we are seeing the bullseye on the left 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.890
 with different drawings this is a 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.710
 sort of panel that they rode on the 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.180
 pax east so that the developers and 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.310
 people paint the truth is that the 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.110
 Most things are painted by 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.940
 river ter so to speak by designers 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.590
 for example the diana is incredible 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.360
 see what face and how cool is a 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.970
 last if we look to the left 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.800
 It also has a kind of woman zag or 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.170
 such a strange thing not like giving 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.240
 an Adriana kiss is funny but let's 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.740
 focus on what interests us the 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.180
 right we are seeing enough 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.630
 different images 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.940
 its optimal a matrix s also seems 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.590
 be but we focus on an image that 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.110
 we've seen a lot on the channel and that 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.910
 has brought enough times and that comes 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.500
 within my theory of the displaced 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.449
 let's move on to the next image so that 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.880
 we focus to see what you are seeing 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:56.160
 and no no need to repeat or speak 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.750
 about this we see on the left the 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.220
 Velcro seats in which we have seen 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.810
 this image we see that it has the same 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.660
 characteristics than the one on the right 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.729
 down we see the record the recall of 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:08.039
 base spin of víctor believes the creator 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:10.919
 that shows that champion or that kind of 

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:12.000
 said flying seems to be and if we 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:14.340
 we set to the right as it has that 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.169
 image that more than that more than saying 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.400
 I do not know what to say honestly I think that 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:19.199
 it is clear that you stay in a new 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.840
 champion a skin of some champion 

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:23.400
 existing we will be aware and I think I believe 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.229
 that throughout the days we can 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.210
 knowing also more things is to tell you 

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:28.919
 the champion is very close and not 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.139
 I think we take time to see him champion
