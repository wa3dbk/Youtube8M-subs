00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.110
 Hello, I'll make you show today 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.450
 Have a delicious panna cotta with you 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.349
 strawberry sauce can do all the ingredients 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:15.089
 which we need are 400 milliliters 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:20.760
 cream 100 grams of sugar 50 grams each 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:25.470
 one vanilla pod is portioned three 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.359
 leaves gelantine and 400 grams 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.609
 Strawberries I have now frozen 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.309
 they are just as good as you can be 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:36.120
 also use fresh ones 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:40.050
 kitchen utensils we need a pot 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.829
 with a whisk four panna cotta 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.510
 ramekins 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.989
 You can also alternatively a muffin 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:50.219
 take sheet metal and last one more 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.510
 key and a wand mixer then 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.899
 start now to the panna cotta 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.120
 do 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.489
 is very important before she does that 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.340
 three leafed gelantine submit the 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.199
 i have already done building and 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.680
 drops give the 400 milliliters cream 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.680
 in there 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.220
 then we have the vanilla bean of the 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.229
 length after slit and the mark 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.150
 scrape out 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.580
 and maybe he wants to scratch that out 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.170
 Take her the best and the flat fair 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.900
 then press a little bit on the side 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:28.159
 it then you can rip it 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.409
 and thus the sharp side of the knife 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:37.259
 a little bit on the bend 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:40.790
 vanilleschote always quite 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:44.090
 They are so difficult to scratch out 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.090
 open 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.909
 Now we can with the bottom of the 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.909
 Messers scratch out the mark 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.900
 otherwise I can turn on the stove and 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.270
 let it boil it up and 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.380
 then we need to about 15 minutes 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.430
 Simmer 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:34.130
 But the sugar has to be 50 g 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:41.570
 sugar and we have to do that now 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:42.650
 boil up so the panna cotta is 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.450
 already boiled up 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.830
 Now you only have 15 minutes left 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.600
 Simmer 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.670
 and i just broke the ba in 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.350
 cut in half and I still do 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.240
 Add cream after 15 minutes 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.860
 We can now have ours simmered 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:03.860
 you have to take three sheets of gelantine 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:07.660
 Express and give and the 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.660
 now have to dissolve with stirring 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.880
 after the roland them the panna 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.310
 cotta what to German just be cooked 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.350
 means dissolved we can the panna 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.270
 fill cotta in the bowl 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.050
 the church I have previously cold 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.050
 rinsed 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.500
 distribute it well in everyone 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.500
 bowl is the same amount 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.410
 and have to shape the panna cotta 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:03.150
 now for about two hours in the 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:05.230
 fridge until they become solid 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.760
 while the panna cotta in the fridge 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.420
 can ever cool the strawberry 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.250
 make loose 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.250
 for that we need the sugar, the 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.550
 strawberries and our state mixa first 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.470
 Let's give the strawberries the keys 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.690
 if you sweetened the frozen ones 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.080
 you do not really have strawberries 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.680
 sugar if he admit but I have it 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:29.890
 would have 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:40.090
 So I give the even and to 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:42.040
 that must be mashed now if 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.650
 The strawberries should be awarded in the 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.260
 look like this and now for the first 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.140
 to make it even finer and the core 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.060
 Out to get us a victory 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:54.130
 and do the strawberry puree by pressing it 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.170
 it's really worth it because the kernels 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.980
 are because of the sauce and the sauce 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:02.140
 also tastes much finer now and so 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.900
 panna cotta got tough and ours 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:07.300
 first finished that would look like that 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.580
 He brought her through the sieve 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.040
 Now we can do the panna cotta 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.210
 serve and make the panna cotta out of the 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.280
 I have one to get companies 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.180
 little trick for you and that takes 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.500
 a bowl of hot water 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:24.610
 she shows the panna cotta for a moment 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:29.130
 So about a half minute then 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.130
 can you take her out? 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.210
 and now I have a plate on the 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:37.170
 they will do the piece 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:40.030
 over it and then turn around very quickly 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:45.160
 and then with luck is the panna cotta 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:47.590
 even out there and now 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.970
 we can just a little bit more 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.970
 strawberry sauce on it 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.530
 and already is our delicious panna cotta 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.650
 finished with strawberry sauce much fun 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.650
 to cook
