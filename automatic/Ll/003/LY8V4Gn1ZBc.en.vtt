00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.840 
and so I can ask like is this
appropriate<00:02:25.860> how<00:02:26.250> would<00:02:26.430> South<00:02:26.610> Park

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
appropriate how would South Park

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.280 
appropriate how would South Park
represent<00:02:27.360> this<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.900> that's<00:02:28.080> ultimately

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
represent this and that's ultimately

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.320 
represent this and that's ultimately
what<00:02:28.650> we<00:02:28.770> want<00:02:28.800> is<00:02:29.220> for<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.820> player<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.030> feel

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
what we want is for the player to feel

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.280

like they're playing a South Park
episode<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.860> think<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.220> stick<00:02:32.880> of<00:02:32.970> truth

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
episode I think that stick of truth

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.790 
episode I think that stick of truth
really<00:02:33.360> hit<00:02:33.630> that<00:02:33.810> well<00:02:33.990> and<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.440> think<00:02:34.560> that's

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
really hit that well and I think that's

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.259 
really hit that well and I think that's
definitely<00:02:35.070> the<00:02:35.430> bar<00:02:35.640> that<00:02:35.820> we've<00:02:35.940> set<00:02:36.150> for

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
definitely the bar that we've set for

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.740 
definitely the bar that we've set for
ourselves<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:37.620> independence<00:02:38.220> we<00:02:38.370> have<00:02:38.750> the
