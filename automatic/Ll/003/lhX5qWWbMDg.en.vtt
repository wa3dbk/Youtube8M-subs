00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 I'll show you today we knit socks 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:10.349
 can and that is the part one namely 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:13.410
 the stop and the curb in the 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.969
 infobox I link the others 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.869
 as soon as you are online 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.510
 or I will be at the end of this 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.730
 videos also make a note 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.090
 Furthermore, I left you in the left 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.279
 infobox all elements this guide 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.059
 if they left you too fast 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.730
 like here during the video 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:38.489
 he makes a stitch stop 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.710
 takes the thread here meanwhile the 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.770
 little finger and the ring finger and 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.430
 fad back behind the hand past the 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.840
 Forefinger room once around the thumb 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.770
 and stuck with a 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:56.370
 Now you bring the phases and pulls him 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.410
 by i hit for women cared 14 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.239
 stitches per needle on and for men 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.579
 socks 15 mesh 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.610
 In the beginning , it is easier if one 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:09.150
 all stitches on a needle on beats 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.060
 so i show it to you i'll show it 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.520
 But on bigger fools and one 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.189
 other want because you better see how 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.759
 you like me for the stop 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:24.180
 you should either have a number larger 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.430
 use needles or - very small ones 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.630
 needles are two and a half alike 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.250
 two needles together 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.600
 if you took all mesh 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:40.979
 then four times fourteen for women should be 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.380
 Do 14 stitches each on one 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.960
 needle or 15 or 16 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:51.560
 if you have very big feet so 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.560
 14 stitches on the next needle 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.420
 there is still a needle 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.060
 and again 14 mesh on the nothing 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.500
 needle 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.500
 I have all too quickly turned 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:28.290
 now would have to look that stop 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:31.500
 then not twisted so you put it 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.410
 on the table so well that the 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.840
 nato always looks inward that the 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.220
 does not seem reasonable otherwise 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.780
 your one stop 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.690
 and then I can do the thread again 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.960
 record and start a bunch 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:52.860
 pattern to knit right two stitches 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:56.250
 right and two stitches left and that 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.860
 distributed over all four needles at 14 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.380
 ate it goes quite nicely from that 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.050
 two stitches per needle on the right two 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.070
 meshes are left but with the second 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.620
 needle 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.810
 He would then have left with two stitches 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.590
 and two mesh right start 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.050
 I'll show you what that is 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:21.400
 next needle and here I stretch now 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:26.190
 two stitches left 2 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:31.380
 right 2 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:34.470
 left and two stitches right and so on 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.450
 just keep going until it cuffs 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.910
 is long enough for you 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:43.260
 I prefer the cuffing a little longer 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.700
 so ten centimeters to between 5 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.830
 and 10 10 meters I have it mostly 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.960
 if you prefer a shorter one 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.180
 of course you can have a little bit of support 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.510
 also knit a shorter cuff 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.580
 leave the city to you 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.920
 after covenant comes then the creates 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.590
 so we knit here at the shank 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:05.700
 his normal socks without sausage and 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:09.030
 further we knit then only right 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.860
 when he just knits right the 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.410
 mesh 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.940
 that was already the beginning of it 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.280
 Of course there are others 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.720
 to knit socks 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.480
 I will only do that during the next one 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.840
 weeks or years 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:27.390
 then I have to show him every day 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.510
 work and unfortunately can not do so 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:33.240
 I want every day to make the videos 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.840
 was the first part and as soon as the second 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.910
 Part is finished I hope Moore 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.630
 otherwise the day after tomorrow I link it 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.240
 here 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.430
 I hope you liked it and me 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.790
 wish you a knick-full 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.790
 Day
