the<00:00:52.739> first<00:00:52.770> thing<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.190> I'm<00:00:53.399> going<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.670> do<00:00:53.820> is

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
the first thing that I'm going to do is

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.389 
the first thing that I'm going to do is
focus<00:00:54.270> my<00:00:54.570> attention<00:00:54.690> on<00:00:55.289> this<00:00:55.739> one<00:00:55.800> section

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
focus my attention on this one section

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.540 
focus my attention on this one section

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
easier if I do a small section in the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.860 
easier if I do a small section in the
entire<00:01:01.770> glove<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.120> end<00:01:03.300> you'll<00:01:03.539> see<00:01:03.719> the

scrubbing<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.680> into<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.549> leather<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:00.299> as<00:02:01.020> the

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
scrubbing it into the leather and as the

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.740 
scrubbing it into the leather and as the
camera<00:02:01.500> is<00:02:01.680> showing<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:03.060> can<00:02:03.270> see<00:02:03.509> the

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
camera is showing you you can see the

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.490 
camera is showing you you can see the
cleaning<00:02:04.020> properties<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.770> this<00:02:04.920> already

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
cleaning properties of this already

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.619 
cleaning properties of this already
hasn't<00:02:07.500> spent<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.799> lot<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:07.979> time<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.520> with<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.479> as

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
hasn't spent a lot of time in with it as

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.839 
hasn't spent a lot of time in with it as
you<00:02:09.690> can<00:02:09.929> see<00:02:10.110> but<00:02:10.319> nonetheless<00:02:10.580> there<00:02:11.580> is<00:02:11.700> an

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
you can see but nonetheless there is an

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.660 
you can see but nonetheless there is an
effect

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
effect

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.850 
effect
you<00:02:13.090> can<00:02:13.270> also<00:02:13.450> see<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.930> soiling<00:02:14.410> coming<00:02:14.740> up

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
you can also see the soiling coming up

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.360 
you can also see the soiling coming up
on<00:02:15.040> my<00:02:15.190> fingers<00:02:15.810> so<00:02:16.810> what<00:02:17.470> I<00:02:17.500> like<00:02:17.739> to<00:02:17.800> do<00:02:18.099> is<00:02:18.250> I

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
on my fingers so what I like to do is I

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.729 
on my fingers so what I like to do is I
like<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:18.580> leave<00:02:18.970> it<00:02:19.000> on<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.630> glove<00:02:19.900> for<00:02:20.319> about

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
like to leave it on the glove for about

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.250 
like to leave it on the glove for about
three<00:02:21.280> minutes<00:02:21.790> but<00:02:22.239> making<00:02:22.630> sure<00:02:22.660> that<00:02:23.140> it

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
three minutes but making sure that it

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.740 
three minutes but making sure that it
doesn't<00:02:23.650> dry<00:02:23.940> so<00:02:24.940> I'm<00:02:25.030> pretty<00:02:25.180> liberal<00:02:25.510> an

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
doesn't dry so I'm pretty liberal an

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.199 
doesn't dry so I'm pretty liberal an
application<00:02:26.380> of<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.620> material<00:02:27.190> in<00:02:27.400> making

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
application of the material in making

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.770 
application of the material in making
sure<00:02:28.239> that<00:02:28.450> we<00:02:28.930> have<00:02:29.310> enough<00:02:30.310> time<00:02:30.610> also<00:02:31.450> to

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
sure that we have enough time also to

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.380 
sure that we have enough time also to
allow<00:02:32.350> for<00:02:32.739> the<00:02:32.980> chemistry<00:02:33.520> to<00:02:33.760> work<00:02:34.000> its<00:02:34.209> way

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
allow for the chemistry to work its way

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.750 
allow for the chemistry to work its way
underneath<00:02:34.810> soil<00:02:35.260> particles<00:02:35.830> and<00:02:35.950> lift<00:02:36.610> them

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
underneath soil particles and lift them

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.000 
underneath soil particles and lift them
from<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.060> surface<00:02:37.450> but<00:02:38.230> let's<00:02:38.470> take<00:02:38.709> a<00:02:38.739> look

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
from the surface but let's take a look

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.949 
from the surface but let's take a look
and<00:02:39.190> see<00:02:39.340> what<00:02:39.550> this<00:02:39.730> is<00:02:39.970> done<00:02:40.180> even<00:02:40.630> in<00:02:40.750> a

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
and see what this is done even in a

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.229 
and see what this is done even in a
minute<00:02:41.650> in<00:02:41.800> about<00:02:42.010> a<00:02:42.069> minute<00:02:42.310> or<00:02:42.550> so<00:02:45.030> now<00:02:46.030> look

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
minute in about a minute or so now look

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.490 
minute in about a minute or so now look
at<00:02:46.360> that<00:02:48.150> because<00:02:49.150> this<00:02:49.420> cleaner<00:02:49.810> is<00:02:50.050> pH

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
at that because this cleaner is pH

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.830 
at that because this cleaner is pH
balanced<00:02:51.100> to<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.310> leather<00:02:51.610> it<00:02:51.940> in<00:02:52.150> no<00:02:52.330> way<00:02:52.360> is

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
balanced to the leather it in no way is

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.070 
balanced to the leather it in no way is
going<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.230> affect<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.970> integrity<00:02:55.750> of<00:02:55.840> the

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
going to affect the integrity of the

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.570 
going to affect the integrity of the
leather<00:02:56.260> in<00:02:56.470> fact<00:02:56.769> it's<00:02:56.980> going<00:02:57.130> to<00:02:57.280> improve

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
leather in fact it's going to improve

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.059 
leather in fact it's going to improve
the<00:02:57.850> overall<00:02:57.880> integrity<00:02:58.480> of<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.230> leather<00:02:59.440> by

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
the overall integrity of the leather by

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.180 
the overall integrity of the leather by
rebalancing<00:03:00.549> the<00:03:01.000> pH<00:03:01.530> now<00:03:02.530> what<00:03:02.709> I'm<00:03:02.860> going<00:03:03.130> to

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
rebalancing the pH now what I'm going to

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.070 
rebalancing the pH now what I'm going to
do<00:03:03.340> is<00:03:03.640> I'm<00:03:03.850> going<00:03:03.880> to<00:03:04.120> continue<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:04.720> cleaning

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
do is I'm going to continue the cleaning

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.690 
do is I'm going to continue the cleaning
process<00:03:05.560> and<00:03:05.590> we're<00:03:05.860> all<00:03:06.100> done<00:03:06.400> we're<00:03:06.580> going

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
process and we're all done we're going

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.400 
process and we're all done we're going
to<00:03:06.760> do<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.150> video<00:03:07.299> showing<00:03:07.959> you<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:08.230> end

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
to do the video showing you the end

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.350 
to do the video showing you the end
result<00:03:08.890> and<00:03:09.549> then<00:03:09.819> we're<00:03:09.970> going<00:03:10.150> to

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
result and then we're going to

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.300 
result and then we're going to
demonstrate<00:03:10.690> how<00:03:11.290> we<00:03:11.350> would<00:03:11.680> condition<00:03:12.190> the

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
demonstrate how we would condition the

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.370 
demonstrate how we would condition the
coin<00:03:12.489> now<00:03:12.760> spent<00:03:13.150> ten<00:03:13.420> minutes<00:03:13.600> cleaning<00:03:14.110> this

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
coin now spent ten minutes cleaning this

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.920 
coin now spent ten minutes cleaning this
glove<00:03:14.709> and<00:03:15.310> so<00:03:15.519> let's<00:03:15.790> take<00:03:16.030> a<00:03:16.060> look<00:03:16.420> at<00:03:16.690> what

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
glove and so let's take a look at what

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.650 
glove and so let's take a look at what
we've<00:03:17.079> been<00:03:17.200> able<00:03:17.380> to<00:03:17.530> accomplish<00:03:18.209> so<00:03:19.209> the

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
we've been able to accomplish so the

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.390 
we've been able to accomplish so the
glove<00:03:19.900> is<00:03:20.079> still<00:03:20.410> wet<00:03:20.769> from<00:03:21.040> the<00:03:21.100> cleaning

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
glove is still wet from the cleaning

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.150 
glove is still wet from the cleaning
process<00:03:22.000> and<00:03:22.030> we<00:03:22.269> want<00:03:22.510> it<00:03:22.600> to<00:03:22.720> dry<00:03:22.989> but<00:03:23.739> it's

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
process and we want it to dry but it's

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.390 
process and we want it to dry but it's
amazing<00:03:24.820> how<00:03:24.850> clean<00:03:25.359> it's<00:03:25.600> become<00:03:26.049> the<00:03:26.799> actual

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
amazing how clean it's become the actual

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.090 
amazing how clean it's become the actual
logo<00:03:27.760> from<00:03:28.329> the<00:03:28.359> manufacturer<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.709> fact<00:03:29.980> that

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
logo from the manufacturer the fact that

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.140 
logo from the manufacturer the fact that
the<00:03:30.280> Al<00:03:30.430> Kaline<00:03:31.230> name<00:03:32.230> is<00:03:32.470> appearing<00:03:33.010> but<00:03:33.640> you

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
the Al Kaline name is appearing but you

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.229 
the Al Kaline name is appearing but you
can<00:03:34.329> see<00:03:34.570> the<00:03:34.780> effect<00:03:35.230> of<00:03:35.410> the<00:03:35.560> cleaner<00:03:35.970> and<00:03:36.970> so

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
can see the effect of the cleaner and so

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.420 
can see the effect of the cleaner and so
the<00:03:37.540> cleaner<00:03:37.810> of<00:03:38.109> course<00:03:38.380> it's<00:03:38.590> not<00:03:38.739> fully<00:03:39.070> dry

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
the cleaner of course it's not fully dry

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.000 
the cleaner of course it's not fully dry
yet<00:03:39.670> but<00:03:40.180> when<00:03:40.780> it<00:03:40.900> is<00:03:41.019> fully<00:03:41.260> dry<00:03:41.530> we<00:03:41.709> will<00:03:41.739> be

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
yet but when it is fully dry we will be

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.400 
yet but when it is fully dry we will be
putting<00:03:42.280> it<00:03:42.459> through<00:03:42.670> the<00:03:43.150> next<00:03:43.870> step<00:03:44.170> in<00:03:44.320> the

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
putting it through the next step in the

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.550 
putting it through the next step in the
process<00:03:44.799> which<00:03:45.070> is<00:03:45.130> the<00:03:45.280> conditioning<00:03:45.910> step

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
process which is the conditioning step

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.319 
process which is the conditioning step
what<00:03:47.560> I<00:03:47.799> would<00:03:48.220> like<00:03:48.459> for<00:03:48.670> you<00:03:48.820> to<00:03:48.910> keep<00:03:49.090> in

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
what I would like for you to keep in

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:50.970 
what I would like for you to keep in
mind<00:03:49.600> and<00:03:49.900> oh<00:03:49.989> by<00:03:50.170> the<00:03:50.200> way<00:03:50.380> this<00:03:50.680> is<00:03:50.859> the

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
mind and oh by the way this is the
