00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.440
 the next movement after we 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.990
 learned to cling to the trapezoid we 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.969
 learning to blow the wind that is doing 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.400
 such a movement back hand open 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.920
 front slightly bend dropping the video and 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.020
 feel like your back like thrust in the sail 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.120
 there is less strain on the back 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.930
 it becomes less open sail 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.900
 We do not open the front arm and do not open it. 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.880
 learning to relieve from clinging 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.240
 clinging again and dropping again 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.579
 traction 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.379
 extra main thing to shoulders 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.710
 left behind in the pelvis forward shoulders 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:40.679
 back and a couple with open let them learn 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.780
 cling off unhooked throw off we 

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:44.460
 learning to add traction like that 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.079
 there is a little more body weight 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.089
 we transfer to the back leg as if 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.159
 sit down pelvis forward shoulders back 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.589
 shoulders leave the counterweight and on 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:54.600
 matchbox or a little more 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:56.460
 feed the masts forward the front arm 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.159
 straighten in the back arm add thrust 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.600
 and immediately reset add 5 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:02.699
 it turns out we do this stroke 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.589
 Mast slightly feed forward the most 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.610
 the main thing is that the shoulders did not go for a sail 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.550
 add shadows 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.220
 add open sail add 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.200
 feel like thrust getting bigger what 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.200
 hand work front hand 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.720
 pushing away the back hand she lies 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.610
 from top to put on and we pull the fingers 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.530
 there is no fist if we are 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.990
 work the fist all the energy from Barasa 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.020
 we will remain in the hand that is, we put 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.660
 finger toe and fingers ask 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.040
 ask the park there is support there is support 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.320
 as soon as we feel that there is support 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.930
 more shut back more by 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.390
 traditional loops namely the lower back and 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.590
 load the sail and that is, it turns out we 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.640
 developing shoulders 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.160
 couple forward backward if you would 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.650
 bend your elbows then often a common mistake 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.270
 what does your loop unhook it mean 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.060
 sure you load the whole sail and 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.020
 carry on your arms that is 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.180
 load sail and at the same moment 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.780
 the loop of you is taken away that is try 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.520
 dick sail from yourself pushing the front 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.100
 arm straighten back hand 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.080
 pull out to look for support in the sail here 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.679
 work hands remain when we try 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.870
 work shoulders that is 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.269
 add thrust dump thrusts try 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.379
 put your hands straight sails wring you 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.379
 working shoulders 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.079
 so forward shoulders back 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:29.939
 if he is looking forward on his back foot 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:33.569
 tries not to look at traditional 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:35.840
 loops load sail bend arms 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.090
 cling bend arms cling 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:43.409
 cling from cling 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:46.079
 hooked now shedding back hand 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:48.629
 upper grip open front logo 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:50.359
 slightly bend the body weight on the back 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:54.209
 leg 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:56.340
 looking forward to gusts so that the wind will blow us 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.159
 Do not take the surprise part of the open 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.609
 now, on the contrary, we have already learned 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:05.609
 dump the wind now learn to add 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:07.530
 and accelerates the board bend cling 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:10.230
 behind the trapeze back hand fingers on 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.419
 yourself add thrust type front arm 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.790
 pushing forward we try to hold hands 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:17.040
 straight shoulders work back hand 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.169
 fingers asked sail to have support 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.930
 there is and under as soon as we feel that there is 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:24.689
 prop backs with trapeze through 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.569
 traditional loop load sail 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:29.840
 back loading the front arm push 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.879
 from your back hand add thrust 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.759
 we accelerate to boredom more intensively we begin 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.699
 work with your hands straight arms try 

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:40.880
 use your shoulders more 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:43.400
 paint overclocking 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:48.020
 if he is looking forward on his back foot 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.880
 forward shoulders back cling to the trapezoid 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.610
 slightly sit down in the front hand 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.490
 straighten the back hand add thrust 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.060
 add add overclocking front hand 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.460
 straight 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.950
 back with fingers ask for 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:04.820
 aport have support rely rely 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.280
 back bend from clinging to 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.600
 cling to 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.600
 dumping work shoulders sail 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:15.640
 back and forth weight sail sail sail 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:19.250
 we keep our backs if he is on the back foot 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.930
 forward shoulders back cling if not 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.050
 turned out the first time back in 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:28.070
 starting position and try again 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:30.860
 drop back hand open sail 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.470
 close add thrust accelerates 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.600
 the sail is pushing away the arms straight 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.510
 we work with our shoulders little by little 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:43.070
 stepping away sailing constantly worked 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:46.460
 feel support back support load 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:49.310
 a couple of work constantly add sail 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:52.310
 tilt the nose back hand hold 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:55.510
 the finger of the book the hand pushes forward not 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.510
 hang hands straight
