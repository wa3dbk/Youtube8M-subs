oh state is 12 in one they destroyed
Wisconsin<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.509> think<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.960> should<00:01:28.080> be<00:01:28.140> Ohio

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
Wisconsin I think it should be Ohio

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.510 
Wisconsin I think it should be Ohio
State<00:01:28.680> because<00:01:28.920> when<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.159> put<00:01:29.369> them

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
State because when you put them

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.149 
State because when you put them
head-to-head<00:01:29.810> hio<00:01:30.810> state<00:01:31.110> comes<00:01:31.380> out<00:01:31.590> on<00:01:31.829> top

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
head-to-head hio state comes out on top

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.280 
head-to-head hio state comes out on top
so<00:01:32.689> my<00:01:33.689> argument<00:01:34.909> goes<00:01:35.909> like<00:01:36.090> this<00:01:36.290> Alabama

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
so my argument goes like this Alabama

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.910 
so my argument goes like this Alabama
Florida<00:01:38.280> State<00:01:39.740> Oregon<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.540> Ohio<00:01:42.540> State<00:01:42.920> to

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920
