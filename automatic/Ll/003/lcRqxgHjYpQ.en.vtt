00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
so the multiple twists and turns is a

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.090 
so the multiple twists and turns is a
lot<00:00:03.480> like<00:00:03.659> the<00:00:03.810> single<00:00:04.049> twist<00:00:04.380> and<00:00:04.589> turn

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
lot like the single twist and turn

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.600

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.879 
only you keep it going the most
difficult<00:00:09.090> thing<00:00:09.269> about<00:00:09.360> this<00:00:09.780> move<00:00:10.050> is<00:00:10.380> the

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
difficult thing about this move is the

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.430 
difficult thing about this move is the
more<00:00:11.070> you<00:00:11.130> do<00:00:11.309> it<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.700> busier<00:00:12.179> you<00:00:12.389> get<00:00:12.630> but

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
more you do it the busier you get but

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.320 
more you do it the busier you get but
it's<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.799> pretty<00:00:13.980> simple<00:00:14.250> move<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.880> it's<00:00:15.030> fun
