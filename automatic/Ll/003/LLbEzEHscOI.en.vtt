00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
essentially the 3d part of it is really

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.700 
essentially the 3d part of it is really
cool<00:01:14.130> by<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.610> way<00:01:14.869> but<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.290> next<00:01:16.560> thing

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710

thing is you're going to need this ilm

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.219 
thing is you're going to need this ilm
327<00:01:25.130> Wi-Fi<00:01:26.130> interface<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.659> supports<00:01:28.080> all

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
327 Wi-Fi interface and it supports all

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.580 
327 Wi-Fi interface and it supports all
obd2<00:01:29.130> protocols<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.780> doesn't<00:01:31.079> have<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.350> be<00:01:31.439> the

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
obd2 protocols it doesn't have to be the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.899 
obd2 protocols it doesn't have to be the
Wi-Fi<00:01:31.950> interface<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.579> could<00:01:32.700> be<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
Wi-Fi interface it could be the

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.910 
Wi-Fi interface it could be the
Bluetooth<00:01:33.299> one<00:01:33.630> but<00:01:33.960> we're<00:01:34.079> going<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.259> use<00:01:34.680> the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
Bluetooth one but we're going to use the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.810 
Bluetooth one but we're going to use the
Wi-Fi<00:01:35.670> interface<00:01:36.540> for<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:37.020> little<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.820> test

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
Wi-Fi interface for this little of test

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.039 
Wi-Fi interface for this little of test
or<00:01:39.409> segment<00:01:40.409> today<00:01:40.729> this<00:01:41.729> one<00:01:41.970> was<00:01:42.180> cheaper<00:01:42.630> so

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
or segment today this one was cheaper so

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.649 
or segment today this one was cheaper so
that's<00:01:43.259> why<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.470> got<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.920> Wi-Fi<00:01:44.310> interface<00:01:44.729> now

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
that's why I got the Wi-Fi interface now

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.330 
that's why I got the Wi-Fi interface now
once<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:45.990> plug<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:46.350> into<00:01:46.530> your<00:01:46.710> car<00:01:46.979> and

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
once you plug this into your car and

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.910 
once you plug this into your car and
turn<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.700> power<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:48.030> your<00:01:48.810> car<00:01:49.079> is<00:01:49.470> going<00:01:49.770> to

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
turn the power on your car is going to

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.980 
turn the power on your car is going to
essentially<00:01:50.340> have<00:01:50.640> its<00:01:50.820> own<00:01:50.970> Wi-Fi<00:01:51.450> hotspot

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
essentially have its own Wi-Fi hotspot

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.440 
essentially have its own Wi-Fi hotspot
and<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:53.159> hotspot<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.090> name<00:01:54.270> that's

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
here's where we're going to have to turn

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.100 
here's where we're going to have to turn
sideways<00:04:09.700> because<00:04:10.360> my<00:04:10.599> phone<00:04:10.870> actually

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
sideways because my phone actually

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.069

touches<00:04:15.069> on<00:04:15.280> this<00:04:15.640> side<00:04:16.350> so<00:04:17.350> I'm<00:04:17.410> gonna<00:04:17.560> hit<00:04:17.650> ok

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
touches on this side so I'm gonna hit ok

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.909 
touches on this side so I'm gonna hit ok
so<00:04:19.269> here's<00:04:19.449> what<00:04:19.600> we<00:04:19.690> have<00:04:19.720> so<00:04:19.870> far<00:04:20.079> we<00:04:20.680> got<00:04:20.709> our

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.330 
so here's what we have so far we got our
coolant<00:04:21.400> we<00:04:21.609> got<00:04:21.759> our<00:04:21.880> GPS<00:04:22.509> height<00:04:22.919> and<00:04:23.919> we<00:04:24.220> got

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
coolant we got our GPS height and we got

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.850 
coolant we got our GPS height and we got
our<00:04:24.520> acceleration<00:04:25.150> there<00:04:25.590> then<00:04:26.590> I'm<00:04:26.680> going<00:04:26.800> to

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
our acceleration there then I'm going to

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.409 
our acceleration there then I'm going to
scroll<00:04:27.190> up<00:04:27.250> and<00:04:27.669> you<00:04:27.820> can<00:04:27.970> see<00:04:28.150> that<00:04:28.330> I've
