 needing the backyard of a primer to 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.150
 eyes or any other part of the 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:31.230
 face can the first common face and is 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.120
 important that it is okay or white 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.520
 transparent 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.120
 You will put the team will get a 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.120
 little cup 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:46.059
 and put o any whole here in the background 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.059
 everything good 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:56.320
 this trailer I'm using it is 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.870
 How did I mention make b? 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.500
 it does not have any coordinated shine 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:09.390
 looks like a just white glue 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:13.110
 I'll take all the right product. 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.610
 and put a pot like this before 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.100
 transparent or doing to show 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.860
 You need to get the tweezer cable. 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:24.290
 This little guy who does not have his teeth is 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:27.690
 Good and you will get a brown shadow 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.640
 opaque matte that corresponds to the 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:34.470
 color of your eyebrow 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:37.009
 I'll use this one, you're going to scratch this one. 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.009
 shadow 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:45.039
 and then put into the clinical body 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:49.810
 who is against the sister who is not because 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:52.630
 have seen opel will remove all shade 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.600
 only that I told you 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:59.439
 taking care people that haunt can 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.229
 utah's best eyebrow does not have the 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:08.440
 Shiner for the love of god do not make me 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:11.079
 this with a shadow with glitter people 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:16.030
 lance none of this is 

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:17.650
 I've taken all the shade out, I'll come 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:31.030
 here now in flight 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:33.610
 the jack nicholson here does not 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:51.310
 declare a lot of it in the cup then you 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:53.170
 will end up losing the product only there 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.380
 when I came to see my 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.340
 Of course I used enough plague to 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.290
 eyes 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.400
 so what I'm going to do I'm going to get it 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:06.519
 a little darker umbrella 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.530
 now I'm going to use this trigger drag 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:12.790
 I'll get the brown s here more 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:15.720
 dark and I'll add a little 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.720
 his too 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.440
 so come on 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.650
 How deep is that brown? 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:37.540
 Today I put it good but now I'm going to 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:44.470
 inspire government 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:48.280
 The color that I'm going to tire of can not 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:52.569
 stay a lot then you'll have to 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:55.209
 making little by little to get your tone 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:58.030
 ideal, I 'll mix a little more 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:01.630
 shadow brown rock was still little and 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:04.420
 let's go 1 despite the attack, my 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.150
 mix is ​​in this brown which is the tone 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.620
 That worked for me and I started. 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.250
 I tested it on my eyebrow 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.480
 so I used half a tub of that 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.650
 for eyes 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:21.669
 I used two shades of darker brown 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:25.570
 I used this one just a little bit of the palette 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:28.060
 I turned around and used a little bit of 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.810
 which is a street well because a pomegranate 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.990
 more pale chocolate 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:37.210
 these were the colors I used 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:42.099
 The mixture stayed like this, it really 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:45.729
 a creminho is also a little muddy and not 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:48.840
 it's too brown or too black or 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:51.520
 gray stayed in the hotel ideal for me then 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:55.090
 There you can use a brush. 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.950
 bevelled and will not pick up that 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.860
 Show you where you can put it. 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:03.760
 but you can put it in any 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:06.400
 tiny little pot and accommodate 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.039
 or has a very nice way 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.820
 You have to get a syringe with a 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:16.210
 needle a little thicker than the calibe 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:19.030
 not in tuba, just explain at the pharmacy 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:22.830
 sells there I think it 's head up is a 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:26.950
 50 you make a little hole right up here 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:29.920
 even if you take the product with the 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:32.250
 Syria and injects back here 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:36.880
 Then you did it with the lid open. 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:40.000
 because otherwise the product will not enter 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:42.820
 there then just close store is 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.010
 ready and use right then that's it I hope 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.950
 that you have liked and now show with 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.910
 with this is the economy product on the 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.030
 row 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:56.470
 this eyebrow never told me anything 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:59.770
 sees and this is with toxic products reaching 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:02.290
 everything has x super good and good here it will be 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.930
 cover and cause of the prime that she goes alone 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:07.630
 also new hairstyle for you to see 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:12.400
 How super easy to pass I got a 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:18.660
 with the brush and there I just saw 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:21.850
 your eyebrow wrapping and applying 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:26.830
 I'm wrong on the video, do not kill me anymore. 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:29.220
 It's because the far-seeing spiritist is just 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.220
 go filling 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:38.590
 normal even as if it were a shadow and 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:41.020
 she's right, I'm sure she's super 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:46.330
 well filled gets better filled 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:48.460
 than if it were a shadow and you 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:51.880
 can make your ideal tone 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:53.950
 and in addition the sai much cheaper 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:57.760
 than buying a world cup ready for 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:07:01.450
 eyebrows that is on average 60 reais 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:05.979
 good guys then the tire has already removed everything 

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:08.080
 and I put it in this little pot he belongs to my 

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:10.380
 even the staff he has two 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:13.870
 compartments then it is closed 

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:17.169
 usually as I use this poor in 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:22.120
 coconut tremonti and gets all vetoed this 

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:25.030
 will prevent my gel from my 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:27.520
 sec eyebrow logo then this is it 

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:29.470
 species have liked and if you liked 

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.510
 I liked with part of the video with other 

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:33.640
 people also learn how to make their 

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:36.510
 solution for eyebrows up to the 

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.510
