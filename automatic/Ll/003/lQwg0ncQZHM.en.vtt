work for a hardtop it's nice because

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.140 
work for a hardtop it's nice because
when<00:03:13.620> you<00:03:13.709> have<00:03:13.860> a<00:03:13.890> gear<00:03:14.310> in<00:03:14.340> it<00:03:14.640> you<00:03:14.820> push<00:03:15.030> it

when you have a gear in it you push it

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.850 
when you have a gear in it you push it
all<00:03:15.269> up<00:03:15.450> it's<00:03:15.810> everything<00:03:16.140> sit<00:03:16.380> really<00:03:16.530> tight

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
all up it's everything sit really tight

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.850 
all up it's everything sit really tight
so<00:03:17.400> it<00:03:18.030> definitely<00:03:18.480> won't<00:03:18.570> rattle<00:03:18.870> it<00:03:19.590> makes

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
so it definitely won't rattle it makes

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.400 
so it definitely won't rattle it makes
it<00:03:19.980> really<00:03:20.100> quiet<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:20.790> plus<00:03:21.660> being<00:03:21.930> aluminum

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
it really quiet and plus being aluminum

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.199 
it really quiet and plus being aluminum
makes<00:03:22.560> it<00:03:22.650> real<00:03:22.739> lightweight<00:03:23.160> because<00:03:23.880> all

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
makes it real lightweight because all

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.600 
makes it real lightweight because all
that<00:03:24.360> stuff<00:03:24.570> gets<00:03:24.750> kind<00:03:24.959> of<00:03:25.019> heavy<00:03:25.170> so<00:03:26.160> it

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
that stuff gets kind of heavy so it

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.060 
that stuff gets kind of heavy so it
works<00:03:26.790> out<00:03:26.970> really<00:03:27.209> good<00:03:27.540> rack<00:03:28.320> positions<00:03:28.830> for

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
works out really good rack positions for

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.650 
works out really good rack positions for
the<00:03:29.250> rack<00:03:30.709> bottle<00:03:31.709> tray<00:03:32.180> and<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.269> towel<00:03:33.480> rack

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
the rack bottle tray and the towel rack

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.090 
the rack bottle tray and the towel rack
if<00:03:34.590> you<00:03:34.860> just<00:03:35.130> wanted<00:03:35.580> the<00:03:36.420> rack<00:03:36.950> we<00:03:37.950> have<00:03:38.070> a

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
if you just wanted the rack we have a

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.420 
if you just wanted the rack we have a
smaller<00:03:38.489> hinge<00:03:39.420> for<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.780> front<00:03:40.130> goes<00:03:41.130> in<00:03:41.340> the

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
smaller hinge for the front goes in the

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.610 
smaller hinge for the front goes in the
same<00:03:41.580> location<00:03:42.180> it's<00:03:42.870> a<00:03:42.930> little<00:03:43.260> bit<00:03:43.380> lower

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
same location it's a little bit lower

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.220 
same location it's a little bit lower
than<00:03:44.519> that<00:03:44.580> one<00:03:44.910> so<00:03:45.300> the<00:03:45.660> rack<00:03:45.900> would<00:03:46.050> be<00:03:46.200> a

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
than that one so the rack would be a

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.020 
than that one so the rack would be a
little<00:03:46.440> lower<00:03:46.590> but<00:03:47.220> then<00:03:47.430> you'd<00:03:47.580> only<00:03:47.700> need

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
little lower but then you'd only need

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.240 
little lower but then you'd only need
the<00:03:48.209> hinge<00:03:48.450> part<00:03:48.690> for<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:48.989> front<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:50.010> gear

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
the hinge part for the front the gear

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
the hinge part for the front the gear
rack<00:03:50.489> the<00:03:51.360> rear<00:03:51.410> bracket<00:03:52.410> mount<00:03:52.830> and<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:54.030> pins

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
we're gonna start selling a time joint

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.700 
we're gonna start selling a time joint
system<00:05:10.100> to<00:05:10.310> where<00:05:10.490> you<00:05:11.000> can<00:05:11.180> mount<00:05:11.330> this<00:05:11.710> solid

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
so that doesn't have a pins and doesn't

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.160 
so that doesn't have a pins and doesn't
move<00:05:15.770> up<00:05:16.160> or<00:05:16.310> down<00:05:16.600> but<00:05:17.600> this<00:05:17.690> is<00:05:17.750> the<00:05:17.930> best
