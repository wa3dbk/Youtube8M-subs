these 10 inch wheels that we're

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.540 
these 10 inch wheels that we're
test-fitting<00:00:15.540> them<00:00:15.839> on<00:00:15.990> when<00:00:16.890> we<00:00:16.949> test<00:00:17.190> fit<00:00:17.400> in

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.070 
test-fitting them on when we test fit in
them<00:00:17.670> after<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.029> swap<00:00:18.300> meets<00:00:18.600> because<00:00:18.869> we

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
them after the swap meets because we

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.370 
them after the swap meets because we
were<00:00:19.170> super<00:00:19.500> keen<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:20.010> lo<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:20.760> behold

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
were super keen and lo and behold

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.560 
were super keen and lo and behold
they're<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.410> little<00:00:22.740> too<00:00:22.890> tight<00:00:23.189> on<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:24.090> inside

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
they're a little too tight on the inside

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.460 
they're a little too tight on the inside
and<00:00:25.260> they<00:00:25.529> hit<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.800> box<00:00:26.039> so<00:00:26.640> we<00:00:27.330> thought<00:00:28.320> we

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
and they hit the box so we thought we

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.990 
and they hit the box so we thought we
might<00:00:28.650> have<00:00:28.680> this<00:00:28.980> problem<00:00:29.310> but<00:00:29.609> we're<00:00:29.760> hoping

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
might have this problem but we're hoping

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.209 
might have this problem but we're hoping
we<00:00:30.150> wouldn't<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.750> we're<00:00:30.929> gonna<00:00:31.080> do<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.830> bit<00:00:32.130> of

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
we wouldn't and we're gonna do a bit of

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.370 
we wouldn't and we're gonna do a bit of
a<00:00:32.309> mini<00:00:32.460> tub<00:00:32.820> if<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.270> will<00:00:33.480> which<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:33.989> where<00:00:34.230> we

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
a mini tub if you will which is where we

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.400 
a mini tub if you will which is where we
cut<00:00:34.590> some<00:00:35.280> wheel<00:00:35.460> wells<00:00:35.700> into<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.899> truck<00:00:37.170> box

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
cut some wheel wells into the truck box

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.500 
cut some wheel wells into the truck box
here's<00:00:38.070> our<00:00:38.250> tires<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.730> can<00:00:38.760> see<00:00:39.030> they're

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
here's our tires you can see they're

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:47.060 
here's our tires you can see they're
kind<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.110> big<00:00:42.680> so<00:00:43.680> they<00:00:44.460> hit<00:00:44.879> in<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:46.710> middle

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
kind of big so they hit in this middle

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.729 
kind of big so they hit in this middle
section<00:00:47.309> here<00:00:47.550> about<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.480> high<00:00:48.690> because<00:00:49.620> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
section here about this high because the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.560 
section here about this high because the
truck<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.010> fairly<00:00:50.550> high<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:51.030> most<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.449> the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
truck is fairly high so most of the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.569 
truck is fairly high so most of the
fender<00:00:51.930> space<00:00:52.230> here<00:00:52.530> wasn't<00:00:52.949> affected<00:00:53.460> but

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
fender space here wasn't affected but

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.150 
fender space here wasn't affected but
this<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:54.390> was<00:00:54.660> fitting<00:00:54.989> here<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.860> what<00:00:56.010> we've

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
this it was fitting here so what we've

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.020 
this it was fitting here so what we've
done<00:00:56.399> we've<00:00:56.910> marked<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.390> out<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:58.730> we<00:00:59.730> come<00:00:59.879> up

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
done we've marked it out and we come up

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.740 
done we've marked it out and we come up
to<00:01:00.149> here<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.510> where<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.930> floor<00:01:02.300> the<00:01:03.300> bottom<00:01:03.660> of

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
to here to where the floor the bottom of

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.899 
to here to where the floor the bottom of
the<00:01:03.840> wood<00:01:03.989> floor<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.159> we've<00:01:05.489> marked<00:01:05.790> it

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
the wood floor is and we've marked it

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.810 
the wood floor is and we've marked it
out<00:01:06.060> because<00:01:06.390> we're<00:01:06.600> using<00:01:07.490> hey<00:01:08.490> those<00:01:08.729> look

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
out because we're using hey those look

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.469 
out because we're using hey those look
familiar<00:01:09.060> from<00:01:09.979> there<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.640> pieces<00:01:12.030> we<00:01:12.150> used

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
familiar from there the pieces we used

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.679 
familiar from there the pieces we used
for<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.409> widening<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.340> outer<00:01:14.580> fenders<00:01:15.090> so

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
for the widening of the outer fenders so

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.350 
for the widening of the outer fenders so
we're<00:01:15.869> gonna<00:01:15.990> use<00:01:16.080> our<00:01:16.530> leftovers<00:01:17.460> on<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
we're gonna use our leftovers on the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.899 
we're gonna use our leftovers on the
inside<00:01:18.720> kind<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.229> like<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.619> rat<00:01:19.920> rod<00:01:20.130> mentality

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
inside kind of like a rat rod mentality

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.460 
inside kind of like a rat rod mentality
but<00:01:21.150> actually<00:01:21.900> it's<00:01:22.020> probably<00:01:22.110> just<00:01:22.350> because

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
but actually it's probably just because

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.160 
but actually it's probably just because
Dave's<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.979> cheap<00:01:23.189> bastard<00:01:23.369> mentality<00:01:24.240> any

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
Dave's a cheap bastard mentality any

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.819 
Dave's a cheap bastard mentality any
case<00:01:25.640> yeah<00:01:26.640> we<00:01:27.060> marked<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.450> out<00:01:27.650> and<00:01:28.650> we're

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
case yeah we marked it out and we're

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:29.990 
case yeah we marked it out and we're
gonna<00:01:28.950> cut<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.220> well<00:01:29.430> what's<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.759> gonna<00:01:29.850> look

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
gonna cut it well what's it gonna look

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.670 
gonna cut it well what's it gonna look
like<00:01:30.060> when<00:01:30.299> we're<00:01:30.450> done<00:01:30.479> well<00:01:31.259> when<00:01:31.380> it's<00:01:31.500> cut

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
like when we're done well when it's cut

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.480 
like when we're done well when it's cut
out<00:01:31.770> it's<00:01:32.070> gonna<00:01:32.189> look<00:01:32.369> like<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:36.560> so<00:01:37.560> we're

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
out it's gonna look like this so we're

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.359 
out it's gonna look like this so we're
gonna<00:01:38.579> cut<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.909> wood<00:01:39.060> back<00:01:40.009> to<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.100> frame

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
gonna cut the wood back to the frame

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.280 
gonna cut the wood back to the frame
here<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:41.850> we're<00:01:42.060> gonna<00:01:42.150> go<00:01:42.360> as<00:01:42.570> much<00:01:42.750> as<00:01:42.899> we<00:01:43.020> can

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
here so we're gonna go as much as we can

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.370 
here so we're gonna go as much as we can
to<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:44.430> frame<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:45.030> also<00:01:45.240> helps<00:01:45.540> with

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
to the frame and this also helps with

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.690 
to the frame and this also helps with
back<00:01:46.649> where<00:01:46.829> we<00:01:46.890> were<00:01:46.979> talking<00:01:47.220> about<00:01:47.399> when<00:01:47.610> we

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
back where we were talking about when we

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.960 
back where we were talking about when we
installed<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.270> four<00:01:48.509> link<00:01:49.159> you<00:01:50.159> can<00:01:50.340> see<00:01:50.640> that

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
installed the four link you can see that

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.649 
installed the four link you can see that
the<00:01:51.119> four<00:01:51.540> link<00:01:51.750> bars<00:01:54.530> go<00:01:55.530> inside<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.280> frame

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
the four link bars go inside the frame

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.420 
the four link bars go inside the frame
and<00:01:57.659> that's<00:01:57.840> good<00:01:58.170> because<00:01:58.560> now<00:01:58.740> if<00:01:59.070> we'd<00:01:59.280> have

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
and that's good because now if we'd have

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.120 
and that's good because now if we'd have
done<00:01:59.579> them<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.000> way<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.590> lot<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.649> them<00:02:01.860> are<00:02:02.009> on

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
done them the way a lot of them are on

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.950 
done them the way a lot of them are on
the<00:02:02.189> outside<00:02:02.640> this<00:02:03.360> would<00:02:03.540> be<00:02:03.630> impossible

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
the outside this would be impossible

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.649 
the outside this would be impossible
we'd<00:02:04.439> have<00:02:04.649> no<00:02:04.860> room<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.460> get<00:02:06.270> more<00:02:06.450> tire

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
we'd have no room to get more tire

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.779 
we'd have no room to get more tire
clearance<00:02:07.020> because<00:02:07.860> this<00:02:08.220> space<00:02:08.489> would<00:02:08.640> all

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
clearance because this space would all

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.900 
clearance because this space would all
be<00:02:08.940> taken<00:02:09.300> up<00:02:09.420> with<00:02:09.569> these<00:02:09.780> bars<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.730> so<00:02:11.730> now

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
be taken up with these bars and so now

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.880 
be taken up with these bars and so now
we're<00:02:12.420> okay<00:02:12.780> we're<00:02:13.080> gonna

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
we're okay we're gonna

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.300 
we're okay we're gonna
cut<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.580> hood<00:02:14.760> out<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.800> go<00:02:16.800> from<00:02:16.920> there<00:02:17.100> okay

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
cut the hood out and go from there okay

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.530 
cut the hood out and go from there okay
so<00:02:18.060> here<00:02:18.510> we<00:02:18.630> are<00:02:18.660> now<00:02:19.820> however<00:02:20.820> many<00:02:21.030> hours<00:02:21.510> of

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
so here we are now however many hours of

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.840 
so here we are now however many hours of
toil<00:02:22.050> later<00:02:22.400> and<00:02:23.400> we've<00:02:23.640> cut<00:02:23.990> the<00:02:24.990> hole<00:02:25.080> out<00:02:25.110> on

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
toil later and we've cut the hole out on

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:32.330 
toil later and we've cut the hole out on
both<00:02:26.850> sides<00:02:26.990> and<00:02:29.150> cut<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.560> wood<00:02:31.560> deck<00:02:31.830> out<00:02:32.040> and

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
both sides and cut the wood deck out and

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.290 
both sides and cut the wood deck out and
the<00:02:33.150> wool<00:02:34.970> right<00:02:35.970> here<00:02:36.680> cut<00:02:37.680> it<00:02:37.710> all<00:02:37.890> around

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
the wool right here cut it all around

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.490 
the wool right here cut it all around
actually<00:02:39.300> considering<00:02:39.750> I'm<00:02:39.840> using<00:02:40.020> a<00:02:40.230> regular

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
actually considering I'm using a regular

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.080 
actually considering I'm using a regular
cutoff<00:02:40.920> wheel<00:02:41.070> I<00:02:41.130> think<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.520> hole<00:02:41.670> turned<00:02:41.910> out

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
cutoff wheel I think the hole turned out

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.320 
cutoff wheel I think the hole turned out
pretty<00:02:42.540> round<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:43.340> we<00:02:44.340> can<00:02:44.490> see<00:02:47.030> that<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:48.210> goes

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
pretty round and we can see that it goes

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.620 
pretty round and we can see that it goes
in<00:02:48.630> there

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
in there

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.790 
in there
so<00:02:51.630> that's<00:02:51.900> tire<00:02:52.110> clearance<00:02:52.470> we<00:02:52.530> did<00:02:52.680> now

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
so that's tire clearance we did now

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.940 
so that's tire clearance we did now
before<00:02:53.100> now<00:02:53.280> we<00:02:53.340> could<00:02:53.640> run<00:02:53.850> you<00:02:54.810> know<00:02:54.950> three

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
before now we could run you know three

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.090 
before now we could run you know three
inches<00:02:56.220> more<00:02:56.459> offset<00:02:57.060> backspacing<00:02:57.750> I<00:02:58.230> had<00:02:58.950> to

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
inches more offset backspacing I had to

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.080 
inches more offset backspacing I had to
cut<00:02:59.310> four<00:03:00.300> inches<00:03:01.130> four<00:03:02.130> inches<00:03:02.160> out<00:03:02.670> of<00:03:02.790> here

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
cut four inches four inches out of here

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.390 
cut four inches four inches out of here
when<00:03:04.050> I<00:03:04.080> cut<00:03:04.380> this<00:03:04.560> back<00:03:04.800> to<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.100> frame<00:03:05.370> so

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
when I cut this back to the frame so

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.760 
when I cut this back to the frame so
it's<00:03:05.640> gained<00:03:05.880> us<00:03:06.030> four<00:03:06.300> inches<00:03:06.770> entire

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
it's gained us four inches entire

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.310 
it's gained us four inches entire
clearance<00:03:08.190> on<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.370> inside<00:03:08.910> so<00:03:09.840> we<00:03:10.050> could<00:03:10.200> run

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
clearance on the inside so we could run

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.100 
clearance on the inside so we could run
a<00:03:10.380> pretty<00:03:10.650> big<00:03:10.890> wheel<00:03:11.160> if<00:03:11.490> we<00:03:11.670> wanted<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.209> with

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
a pretty big wheel if we wanted to with

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.930 
a pretty big wheel if we wanted to with
probably<00:03:13.440> up<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:13.680> 6<00:03:13.950> inches<00:03:14.130> of<00:03:14.310> back<00:03:14.580> spacing

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
probably up to 6 inches of back spacing

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:22.880 
probably up to 6 inches of back spacing
so<00:03:15.650> yeah<00:03:16.650> that's<00:03:17.280> a<00:03:17.610> lot<00:03:18.090> of<00:03:18.209> tire<00:03:18.560> so<00:03:21.890> until

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
so yeah that's a lot of tire so until

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.280 
so yeah that's a lot of tire so until
next<00:03:23.010> time
