00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:18.150
 Hello everyone 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:22.910
 today let's see how to decorate the cover of 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:25.140
 a cellphone of the iphone and samsung is 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.970
 easy to find covers of 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.939
 replacement 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.329
 I instead have a ngm phone two cards 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.430
 it is I sincerely until today 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.200
 until today I could not find 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.840
 a spare cover so I decided to 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.910
 to decorate it alone because I was 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.510
 tired of always seeing this cover 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:55.760
 all black so using a piece of 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:59.149
 Kraft paper of the grape base will decorate the 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.149
 mobile to my taste 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:08.670
 first of all I cut the piece of 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:12.360
 paper fit for my cover and I have 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:18.030
 punctured the top because it is 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:20.600
 present a camera I drilled 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.439
 using a half-inch punch 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:30.780
 I will stick the paper to the cover 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:35.520
 using mode pong is a brush 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:39.210
 of sponge the wood pong allows us to 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:43.020
 then waterproof the paper 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.310
 I can support it by placing the cover in 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.579
 any surface 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.670
 and this also becomes washable therefore 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.259
 initially we see that the mod podge se 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.320
 we don't like a part first 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.979
 of drying we can remove it with 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:03.210
 of simple water but later 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.510
 drying becomes super resistant e 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.670
 then 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:13.810
 you can no longer remove my cover a 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:17.100
 small holes in the lower part 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.150
 so after the glue has dried 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:24.000
 I'll use a needle 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:30.040
 is from the inside will recreate the holes 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:35.470
 since my cover has a screen 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:41.250
 protective or plastic or have to have 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:43.360
 the foresight to cover the part 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.890
 transparency of the glass because otherwise 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:52.650
 an opaque film is created is 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:58.830
 the photos will be bad we start immediately 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.830
 we spread the glue on the paper 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.930
 let's join the cover 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:07.099
 and we pass the glue in the part 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.099
 upper even passing it on the edge 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.660
 now you see it white but once 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.620
 dry becomes transparent 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.620
 a little like ravina v 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:37.590
 now let the first one dry 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:41.880
 layer is once dry we pass a 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:47.310
 another another layer I recommend 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:50.130
 pass at least three layers of collard e 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:55.580
 after three bond hands 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.580
 the cover of my phone is ready 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:10.070
 and here is a quick and fast way 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:13.170
 above all economic to embellish 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:16.170
 customize a cover 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:19.280
 see you soon with many new projects 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.280
 bye Bye
