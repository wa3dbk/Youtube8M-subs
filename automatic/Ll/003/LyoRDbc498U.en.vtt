00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
it's beyond the midgets I know sort of

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.010 
it's beyond the midgets I know sort of
for<00:01:46.650> me<00:01:46.770> today<00:01:49.250> it<00:01:50.250> will<00:01:50.340> be<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.580> perfect

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
for me today it will be the perfect

for me today it will be the perfect
perfect<00:02:01.400> ride<00:02:02.400> it<00:02:02.580> many<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:02.940> fails<00:02:04.040> you<00:02:05.040> can

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.699 

basically<00:02:12.660> this<00:02:12.989> is<00:02:13.170> different

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
basically this is different

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.170 
basically this is different
they'd<00:02:13.860> have<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.010> board<00:02:14.310> like<00:02:14.520> that<00:02:14.550> be<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.000> bit

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
they'd have a board like that be a bit

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.390 
they'd have a board like that be a bit
bigger<00:02:15.480> off<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.810> air<00:02:15.980> but<00:02:16.980> this<00:02:17.130> would<00:02:17.310> be

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
bigger off the air but this would be

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.830 
bigger off the air but this would be
gone<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.850> we<00:02:17.970> get<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.300> come<00:02:18.450> around<00:02:18.540> there<00:02:18.750> be

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
gone and we get to come around there be

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.990 
gone and we get to come around there be
