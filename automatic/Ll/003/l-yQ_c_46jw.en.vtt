00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
really pretty this is a lip gloss that I

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.890 
really pretty this is a lip gloss that I
would<00:00:25.220> you<00:00:26.220> know<00:00:26.250> be<00:00:26.640> happy<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.210> pull<00:00:27.449> out<00:00:27.660> of

would you know be happy to pull out of
my<00:00:28.050> purse<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.590> reapply<00:00:29.010> because<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:29.760> really

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
my purse and reapply because I really

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.510 
my purse and reapply because I really
think<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.720> packaging<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.349> rather<00:00:31.529> rather

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
think the packaging is rather rather

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.959 
think the packaging is rather rather
pretty<00:00:32.880> it's<00:00:33.300> really<00:00:34.200> it's<00:00:35.130> really<00:00:35.280> big<00:00:35.730> and

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
pretty it's really it's really big and

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.209 
pretty it's really it's really big and
round<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.660> it's<00:00:36.780> also<00:00:36.960> it's<00:00:37.649> also<00:00:37.770> rather

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
round and it's also it's also rather

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.190 
round and it's also it's also rather
tall<00:00:38.640> um<00:00:39.739> but<00:00:40.910> it's<00:00:41.910> kind<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.390> misleading<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:43.110> a

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
tall um but it's kind of misleading in a

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.990 
tall um but it's kind of misleading in a
way<00:00:43.350> because<00:00:43.649> since<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.160> container<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.789> so

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
way because since the container is so

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.639 
way because since the container is so
big<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.870> would<00:00:46.020> think<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.320> you're<00:00:46.559> getting

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
big you would think that you're getting

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.590 
big you would think that you're getting
a<00:00:46.890> lot<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.100> lip<00:00:47.399> gloss<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:48.000> you're<00:00:48.180> really<00:00:48.420> not

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
a lot of lip gloss and you're really not

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.850 
a lot of lip gloss and you're really not
it's<00:00:49.230> only<00:00:49.440> point<00:00:50.129> 15<00:00:50.789> outs<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.750> there's<00:00:52.649> so

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
it's only point 15 outs and there's so

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.299 
it's only point 15 outs and there's so
much<00:00:53.010> plastic<00:00:53.629> that<00:00:54.649> kind<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.710> magnifies<00:00:56.280> it

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
much plastic that kind of magnifies it

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.869 
much plastic that kind of magnifies it
and<00:00:56.820> makes<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.090> look<00:00:57.149> like<00:00:57.829> inside<00:00:58.829> there's<00:00:59.789> a

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
and makes it look like inside there's a

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.180 
and makes it look like inside there's a
big<00:01:00.210> tube<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.870> gloss<00:01:01.109> but<00:01:01.500> if<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.710> look<00:01:01.890> at<00:01:02.039> it

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
big tube of gloss but if you look at it

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.340 
big tube of gloss but if you look at it
from<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.579> end<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.750> doubt<00:01:03.960> it's<00:01:04.140> going<00:01:04.260> to

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
from the end and I doubt it's going to

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.760 
from the end and I doubt it's going to
show<00:01:04.589> on<00:01:04.680> my<00:01:05.720> camera<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:07.049> can<00:01:07.080> really<00:01:07.439> tell

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
show on my camera you can really tell

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.280 
show on my camera you can really tell
the<00:01:08.100> inside<00:01:08.520> there<00:01:08.790> it's<00:01:09.450> just<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.990> tiny<00:01:10.320> tiny

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
the inside there it's just a tiny tiny

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.140 
the inside there it's just a tiny tiny
like<00:01:13.290> there's<00:01:13.710> only<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.950> tiny<00:01:14.220> hollow<00:01:14.580> part<00:01:14.970> in

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
like there's only a tiny hollow part in

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.179 
like there's only a tiny hollow part in
there<00:01:15.299> with<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.720> glasses<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.920> you're<00:01:17.070> not

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
there with the glasses so you're not

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.890 
there with the glasses so you're not
getting<00:01:17.520> much<00:01:17.670> closer<00:01:17.939> at<00:01:18.150> all<00:01:18.330> which<00:01:18.750> is

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
getting much closer at all which is

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.230 
getting much closer at all which is
disappointing<00:01:19.189> these<00:01:20.189> retail<00:01:20.670> for<00:01:20.700> eighteen

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
disappointing these retail for eighteen

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.719 
disappointing these retail for eighteen
dollars<00:01:21.799> with<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:22.950> for<00:01:23.100> eighteen<00:01:23.340> dollars<00:01:23.430> i

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
dollars with so for eighteen dollars i

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.880 
dollars with so for eighteen dollars i
would<00:01:23.909> expect<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.540> little<00:01:25.229> bit<00:01:25.439> more<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.619> lost

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
would expect a little bit more to lost

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.880 
would expect a little bit more to lost
in<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.430> guess<00:01:26.930> as<00:01:27.930> far<00:01:27.990> as<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.380> color<00:01:28.590> it

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
in that I guess as far as the color it

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.300 
in that I guess as far as the color it
is<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.610> nude<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.680> nude<00:01:31.680> pink<00:01:32.840> pinky<00:01:34.100> almost<00:01:35.100> a

of the things that i really like about

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.560 
of the things that i really like about
the<00:02:00.600> gloss<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:01.520> that<00:02:02.520> when<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:02.969> apply<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.270> you

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
the gloss is that when you apply it you

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.380 
the gloss is that when you apply it you
get<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.930> strong<00:02:04.409> cooling<00:02:05.100> minty<00:02:05.850> effect<00:02:06.240> on

your<00:02:06.509> lips<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:07.429> even<00:02:08.429> after<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.849> gloss<00:02:09.289> isn't

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289

your lips and even after the gloss isn't
so<00:02:10.649> shiny<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.310> gloss<00:02:11.489> starts<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:12.030> fade

later<00:02:45.290> it<00:02:46.290> just<00:02:46.500> loses<00:02:46.950> it<00:02:46.980> so<00:02:47.819> this<00:02:48.269> doesn't

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
later it just loses it so this doesn't

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.199 
later it just loses it so this doesn't
at<00:02:48.720> all<00:02:48.750> it's<00:02:49.560> very<00:02:49.830> tingly<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.550> refreshing

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.620 
the whole time that that you have it on
I<00:02:54.690> think<00:02:55.230> at<00:02:55.350> last<00:02:56.269> depending<00:02:57.269> on<00:02:57.360> how<00:02:57.510> much

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
I think at last depending on how much

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.860 
I think at last depending on how much
you're<00:02:57.780> talking<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:58.819> if<00:02:59.819> you<00:03:00.000> drink<00:03:00.330> anything

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
you're talking and if you drink anything

you're talking and if you drink anything
while<00:03:01.350> you're<00:03:01.440> wearing<00:03:01.620> it<00:03:01.860> I<00:03:02.069> think<00:03:02.489> it

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
while you're wearing it I think it

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.000 
while you're wearing it I think it
lasted<00:03:03.030> about<00:03:03.120> an<00:03:03.390> hour<00:03:03.480> on<00:03:03.870> me<00:03:04.080> which<00:03:04.650> isn't

gloss<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:33.329> thing<00:03:33.480> I<00:03:33.570> like<00:03:33.600> the<00:03:33.780> most<00:03:33.930> about<00:03:34.290> it

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
gloss the thing I like the most about it

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.849 
gloss the thing I like the most about it
is<00:03:34.799> the<00:03:35.790> mint<00:03:36.030> eNOS<00:03:36.299> of<00:03:36.540> it<00:03:36.690> was<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:37.680> being

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
is the mint eNOS of it was it being

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:41.270 
is the mint eNOS of it was it being
eighteen<00:03:38.250> dollars<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:39.320> you<00:03:40.320> really<00:03:41.130> not

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
eighteen dollars and you really not

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.009 
eighteen dollars and you really not
getting<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:41.700> whole<00:03:41.820> lot<00:03:41.880> of<00:03:42.090> gloss<00:03:42.299> I<00:03:42.540> don't

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
getting a whole lot of gloss I don't

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.759 
getting a whole lot of gloss I don't
think<00:03:43.109> that<00:03:43.470> I<00:03:43.500> would<00:03:43.709> repurchase<00:03:43.920> this<00:03:44.519> I

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
think that I would repurchase this I

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.630 
think that I would repurchase this I
might<00:03:46.769> try<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:48.269> different<00:03:48.780> color<00:03:48.989> I<00:03:49.519> don't<00:03:50.519> know

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
might try a different color I don't know

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.699 
might try a different color I don't know
eighteen<00:03:51.359> dollars<00:03:51.510> to<00:03:51.900> me<00:03:51.989> is<00:03:52.109> a<00:03:52.140> lot<00:03:52.410> for<00:03:52.650> her

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
eighteen dollars to me is a lot for her

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.860 
eighteen dollars to me is a lot for her
loss<00:03:52.980> and<00:03:53.370> I<00:03:53.430> think<00:03:53.670> it<00:03:53.790> really<00:03:53.970> should<00:03:54.359> be<00:03:54.390> a

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
loss and I think it really should be a

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.720 
loss and I think it really should be a
kick-ass<00:03:55.680> clause<00:03:56.070> if<00:03:56.310> I'm<00:03:56.459> going<00:03:56.579> to<00:03:56.670> be

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
kick-ass clause if I'm going to be

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.030 
kick-ass clause if I'm going to be
spending<00:03:56.970> eighteen<00:03:57.450> dollars<00:03:57.569> and<00:03:57.989> I<00:03:58.079> I<00:03:58.410> think

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
spending eighteen dollars and I I think

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.000 
spending eighteen dollars and I I think
it<00:03:59.130> kind<00:03:59.310> of<00:03:59.370> fall<00:03:59.579> short<00:03:59.910> of<00:04:00.239> being<00:04:01.010> being

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
it kind of fall short of being being

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.009 
it kind of fall short of being being
worthy<00:04:02.310> eighteen<00:04:02.850> dollars<00:04:05.690> but<00:04:06.690> since<00:04:06.900> i
