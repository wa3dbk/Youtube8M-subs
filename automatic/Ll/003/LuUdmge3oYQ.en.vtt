00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:13.899
 bicisport is well found one of the most feared phenomena by all 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:17.789
 sportsmen and all the professional amateur cyclists eh that 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.050
 vibrations are the vibrations 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.720
 it is really a drama to be managed and administered 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.609
 this phenomenon is named. dceme effect is a phenomenon that is 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.279
 manifest they are not bicycles but also 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.010
 in the car special way also in the air and pro landing trolleys 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.079
 for this reason it has been very studied and deepened to avoid 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:39.850
 just 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.630
 aircraft damage and time of landing 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:48.220
 but let's see how we can study this phenomenon well accepted from the point 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.650
 from a mechanical point of view. mechanical view 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.720
 we have to take into account the two parameters that are the avant-garde errebi 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.500
 I would say that the distance between two parallel lines is one passing through the axis of the 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.689
 warning of the handlebar area 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.130
 and the other through the front wheel pin 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.580
 the distance between these two parallel lines represents. the rei 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.630
 the trail is nothing but the projection 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.820
 of the line passing through the hotel handlebar movement ape the perpendicular 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.649
 passing through the front pin which tells us 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.450
 what we say the wheel moves away from its rotation fulcrum 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.360
 for the second parameter I am competing is what most influences the 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.920
 vibrations once then 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.430
 a well built bicycle will surely limit the slices to the maximum 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.180
 vibrations but there are a whole series of measures that can be adopted 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.210
 by the sportsman on his own bicycles that do not depend on the 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.180
 the constructive characteristics 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.660
 but they can be but modified directly to the sportsman we see which 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.550
 they are good, first of all we talk about wheel centering 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.990
 the front wheel must be perfectly centered and here distant 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:11.010
 from the 2 dropouts if front this allows to avoid 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:16.319
 via rotary forces on the wheel during curves particular way 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.269
 the second parameter to be taken into consideration is certainly the 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.579
 perpendicularity of the handlebar with respect to the axis of the bicycle 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:29.339
 and a parameter often underestimated but that at very high speed can 

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:33.069
 become really influential on the vibration of the front wheel 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.799
 third point to be taken into consideration, of course 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.849
 characteristics of the front course 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:44.459
 then the deejay centering of the wheel and therefore it is a nice adjustment 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.160
 of all it was zero at front is also a good mounting of the tire today 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.200
 to the inner tube because even these if not perfectly mounted in theirs 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.140
 seat inside the rim can increase perfect vibrations last 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:00.309
 but not least 

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:03.920
 it is the pressure exerted on the handlebar 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.450
 here too it influences a great deal 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.540
 the vibrations 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.790
 this can be adjusted by perfectly centering the 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.530
 handlebar but also and managing the attitude of the subject who pedaling in such a way that 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.649
 the pressure 

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:23.039
 on the two halves of the handlebar it is more or less identical is a datum that can be 

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.919
 to measure 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:27.619
 which is easily identifiable which also allows us in this case to 

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:32.269
 limiting vibrations as much as possible for today is everything to the next one 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:32.769
 week
