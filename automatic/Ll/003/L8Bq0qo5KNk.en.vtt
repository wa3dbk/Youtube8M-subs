00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
natural projects we're able to do so

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.740 
natural projects we're able to do so
because<00:00:37.280> of<00:00:37.520> our<00:00:37.640> extensive<00:00:38.270> foraging

distinctive delicate flavor this is the

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.520 
distinctive delicate flavor this is the
animal<00:00:58.340> in<00:00:58.460> question<00:00:58.899> so<00:00:59.899> we<00:01:00.170> buy<00:01:00.290> them<00:01:00.440> in

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
animal in question so we buy them in

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.079 
animal in question so we buy them in
whole<00:01:00.739> like<00:01:00.980> this<00:01:01.539> whip<00:01:02.539> off<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:02.840> legs<00:01:04.089> bone

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
whole like this whip off the legs bone

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.050 
whole like this whip off the legs bone
out<00:01:05.119> the<00:01:05.390> saddles<00:01:05.890> the<00:01:06.890> bellies<00:01:07.220> take<00:01:07.940> the

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
out the saddles the bellies take the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.150 
out the saddles the bellies take the
shoulders<00:01:08.600> off<00:01:08.780> then<00:01:09.200> we<00:01:09.320> bone<00:01:09.500> the<00:01:09.649> leg<00:01:09.800> bone

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
shoulders off then we bone the leg bone

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.620 
shoulders off then we bone the leg bone
the<00:01:10.310> shoulders<00:01:12.009> and<00:01:13.009> we<00:01:13.160> cook<00:01:13.310> them<00:01:13.399> flat<00:01:13.670> not

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
the shoulders and we cook them flat not

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.419 
the shoulders and we cook them flat not
so<00:01:14.840> much<00:01:15.020> we<00:01:15.110> don't<00:01:15.289> use<00:01:15.410> water<00:01:15.619> but<00:01:15.800> fast<00:01:16.220> that

00:01:16.419 --> 00:01:16.429 
so much we don't use water but fast that

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:19.949 
so much we don't use water but fast that
much<00:01:16.670> now<00:01:17.860> we<00:01:18.860> use<00:01:19.009> all<00:01:19.190> sorts<00:01:19.369> of<00:01:19.490> techniques

00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:19.959 
much now we use all sorts of techniques

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:22.779 
much now we use all sorts of techniques
okay<00:01:20.959> so<00:01:21.020> that's<00:01:21.319> the<00:01:21.410> shoulder<00:01:21.649> the<00:01:22.220> saddle

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
okay so that's the shoulder the saddle

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:24.609 
okay so that's the shoulder the saddle
we<00:01:22.880> cook<00:01:23.060> slightly<00:01:23.300> differently<00:01:23.810> I<00:01:24.050> like<00:01:24.530> to

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
we cook slightly differently I like to

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.980 
we cook slightly differently I like to
cook<00:01:24.709> it<00:01:24.860> on<00:01:24.979> the<00:01:25.130> on<00:01:25.369> the<00:01:25.610> bone<00:01:25.789> obviously<00:01:26.569> for

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
cook it on the on the bone obviously for

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.389 
cook it on the on the bone obviously for
a<00:01:27.020> flavour<00:01:27.259> as<00:01:27.500> well<00:01:27.709> something<00:01:27.950> cooked<00:01:28.250> on

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
a flavour as well something cooked on

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.839 
a flavour as well something cooked on
the<00:01:28.490> bone

00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:28.849 
the bone

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:33.550 
the bone
so<00:01:29.270> just<00:01:29.750> by<00:01:29.929> eye<00:01:30.099> that's<00:01:31.099> about<00:01:31.340> right<00:01:32.560> just

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
so just by eye that's about right just

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.650 
so just by eye that's about right just
going<00:01:33.709> to<00:01:33.770> carve<00:01:33.979> through<00:01:34.250> the<00:01:35.209> foam<00:01:35.420> like

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
going to carve through the foam like

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.760 
going to carve through the foam like
that<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:38.479> only<00:01:38.660> set<00:01:38.869> menu<00:01:39.080> we<00:01:39.259> do<00:01:39.349> have<00:01:39.560> is<00:01:39.649> at

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
that the only set menu we do have is at

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.940 
that the only set menu we do have is at
a<00:01:39.830> lunch<00:01:39.979> menu<00:01:40.369> for<00:01:40.399> me<00:01:40.670> that<00:01:41.259> the<00:01:42.259> project<00:01:42.740> as

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
a lunch menu for me that the project as

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.999 
a lunch menu for me that the project as
a<00:01:42.979> whole<00:01:43.090> that's<00:01:44.090> what<00:01:44.240> I<00:01:44.270> call<00:01:44.509> it<00:01:44.830> it's<00:01:45.830> more

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
a whole that's what I call it it's more

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.450 
a whole that's what I call it it's more
important<00:01:46.429> than<00:01:46.520> it<00:01:46.550> actually

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
important than it actually

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.780 
important than it actually
I'm<00:01:48.060> not<00:01:48.270> really<00:01:48.420> too<00:01:48.630> bothered<00:01:48.930> about<00:01:48.990> it

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.560 

we're<00:01:53.790> just<00:01:53.820> going<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.060> put<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.479> the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
we're just going to put that in the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.340 
we're just going to put that in the
water<00:01:54.690> bath<00:01:54.960> now<00:01:55.880> 60<00:01:56.880> degree<00:01:57.060> degrees<00:01:57.690> for<00:01:58.020> 18

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
water bath now 60 degree degrees for 18

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.260 
water bath now 60 degree degrees for 18
minutes<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:59.250> all<00:01:59.520> we<00:01:59.670> do<00:01:59.760> we<00:01:59.790> would<00:01:59.970> cook<00:02:00.060> this

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
minutes so all we do we would cook this

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.270 
minutes so all we do we would cook this
in<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.450> in<00:02:01.080> a<00:02:01.170> salt<00:02:01.440> crust<00:02:02.270> for<00:02:03.270> 180<00:02:04.020> degrees<00:02:04.470> for

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
in a in a salt crust for 180 degrees for

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.499 
in a in a salt crust for 180 degrees for
about<00:02:05.400> 40<00:02:05.880> minutes

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
about 40 minutes

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.270 
about 40 minutes
you<00:02:06.630> can<00:02:06.780> bet<00:02:06.960> completely<00:02:07.649> enveloped<00:02:08.069> in<00:02:08.190> salt

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
you can bet completely enveloped in salt

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.260 
you can bet completely enveloped in salt
okay<00:02:11.280> so<00:02:11.340> this<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.700> just<00:02:11.790> coming<00:02:12.060> out<00:02:12.120> of<00:02:12.209> the

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
okay so this is just coming out of the

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.050 
okay so this is just coming out of the
oven<00:02:12.360> we've<00:02:13.020> let<00:02:13.170> it<00:02:13.290> cool<00:02:13.440> down<00:02:13.500> for<00:02:13.950> about<00:02:14.459> 25

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
oven we've let it cool down for about 25

minutes we're just going to going to

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.770 
minutes we're just going to going to
break<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.600> open<00:02:18.660> like<00:02:18.959> that

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.900 

okay<00:02:25.470> so<00:02:25.530> we're<00:02:25.800> gonna<00:02:25.920> do<00:02:26.069> just<00:02:28.640> car<00:02:29.640> little
