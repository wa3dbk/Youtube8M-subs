my<00:00:36.690> experiment<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.350> going<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.590> be<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.739> lot

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
my experiment is going to be a lot

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.590 
my experiment is going to be a lot
cheaper<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.460> don't<00:00:38.760> know<00:00:38.910> if<00:00:39.030> it'll<00:00:39.180> work<00:00:39.270> or

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
cheaper I don't know if it'll work or

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.750 
cheaper I don't know if it'll work or
not<00:00:39.980> but<00:00:41.090> especially<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.570> Revit<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:44.520> Hot

not but especially the Revit and the Hot

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.910 
not but especially the Revit and the Hot
Shots<00:00:45.180> they<00:00:45.450> really<00:00:45.899> lost<00:00:46.170> me<00:00:46.469> because<00:00:46.770> in

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
Shots they really lost me because in

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.540 
Shots they really lost me because in
their<00:00:47.100> advertising<00:00:48.680> they<00:00:49.680> talked<00:00:49.980> about<00:00:50.309> what

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
their advertising they talked about what

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.819 
their advertising they talked about what

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
causes it the engine oil being uses

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.250 
causes it the engine oil being uses
hydraulic<00:00:53.520> oil<00:00:53.760> causes<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.570> film<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.140> gets

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
hydraulic oil causes the film that gets

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.560 
hydraulic oil causes the film that gets
on<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.649> inside<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.730> injectors<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.360> the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
on the inside of the injectors and the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.680 
on the inside of the injectors and the
spool<00:00:57.899> valve<00:00:58.370> which<00:00:59.370> causes<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.120> diction

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
spool valve which causes this diction

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.369 
spool valve which causes this diction
and<00:01:02.420> where<00:01:03.420> they<00:01:03.570> lost<00:01:03.840> me<00:01:04.080> on<00:01:04.110> their

and where they lost me on their

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.609 
and where they lost me on their
advertising<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.220> because<00:01:05.580> they<00:01:05.790> claim<00:01:06.180> that

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
advertising is because they claim that

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:13.399 
advertising is because they claim that
the<00:01:08.750> 7.3<00:01:10.010> 6.0<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:12.090> 6.4<00:01:12.869> liter<00:01:12.930> power

rev X and the hotshots it's like $60 for
a<00:05:04.580> quart<00:05:04.940> so<00:05:05.539> the<00:05:05.810> hotshots<00:05:06.289> is<00:05:06.470> probably<00:05:06.830> the

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
a quart so the hotshots is probably the

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.260 
a quart so the hotshots is probably the
the<00:05:07.700> cheapest<00:05:08.650> but<00:05:09.650> our<00:05:10.250> coil<00:05:10.669> is<00:05:10.910> the<00:05:11.000> only

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
the cheapest but our coil is the only

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.440 
the cheapest but our coil is the only

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
stiction problem in a 6.4 liter so

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.080

injectors if I was going to buy one I

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.740 
injectors if I was going to buy one I
would<00:05:22.160> buy<00:05:22.310> the<00:05:22.370> R<00:05:22.849> coil<00:05:23.150> just<00:05:23.389> for<00:05:23.599> that

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
would buy the R coil just for that

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:24.159 
would buy the R coil just for that

then I'm gonna I'm gonna run the trucks

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.270 
then I'm gonna I'm gonna run the trucks
up<00:05:44.330> put<00:05:44.780> some<00:05:44.810> miles<00:05:45.169> on<00:05:45.440> it<00:05:45.500> circulate<00:05:46.130> it

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
up put some miles on it circulate it

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.080 
up put some miles on it circulate it
through<00:05:46.460> it<00:05:46.610> and<00:05:46.760> then<00:05:46.970> tomorrow<00:05:47.450> I<00:05:48.940> will<00:05:49.940> do

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
through it and then tomorrow I will do

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.090 
through it and then tomorrow I will do
it<00:05:50.180> again<00:05:50.349> you<00:05:51.349> know<00:05:51.469> crank<00:05:51.770> it<00:05:52.010> video<00:05:52.190> it

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 
it again you know crank it video it

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.300 
it again you know crank it video it
and<00:05:53.370> see<00:05:53.640> what<00:05:53.850> it<00:05:53.970> does<00:05:54.420> so<00:05:55.100> tomorrow<00:05:56.100> miss

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
and see what it does so tomorrow miss

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:08.319 
and see what it does so tomorrow miss
you

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:08.329 

00:06:08.329 --> 00:06:55.140 

funnel

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.150 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.050 

okay<00:06:55.930> I<00:06:56.199> added<00:06:56.740> it<00:06:56.889> in<00:06:57.040> there<00:06:57.280> to<00:06:57.970> the

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:58.060 
okay I added it in there to the

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.360 
okay I added it in there to the
crankcase<00:06:58.630> and<00:06:58.960> it's<00:06:59.320> in<00:06:59.440> the<00:06:59.530> fuel<00:06:59.830> injectors

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:00.370 
crankcase and it's in the fuel injectors

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.030 
crankcase and it's in the fuel injectors
which<00:07:00.550> I<00:07:00.910> read<00:07:01.720> stuff<00:07:02.020> through<00:07:02.290> the<00:07:02.380> fuel<00:07:02.650> a

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:03.040 
which I read stuff through the fuel a

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.240 
which I read stuff through the fuel a
lot<00:07:03.820> all<00:07:04.090> sometimes<00:07:04.870> I<00:07:05.050> run<00:07:05.260> Lucas<00:07:05.770> during<00:07:06.160> the

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:06.250 
lot all sometimes I run Lucas during the

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:12.360 
lot all sometimes I run Lucas during the
winter<00:07:06.580> I<00:07:06.610> run<00:07:09.510> the<00:07:10.510> power<00:07:11.229> services<00:07:11.650> diesel

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.370 
winter I run the power services diesel

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:13.950 
winter I run the power services diesel
clean<00:07:12.610> through<00:07:12.940> it<00:07:13.090> to<00:07:13.210> keep<00:07:13.419> the<00:07:13.570> fuel<00:07:13.840> from

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:13.960 
clean through it to keep the fuel from

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.920 
clean through it to keep the fuel from
gelling<00:07:14.470> so<00:07:14.770> normally<00:07:15.729> I<00:07:15.760> run<00:07:16.180> something<00:07:16.570> in

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:16.930 
gelling so normally I run something in

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:19.439 
gelling so normally I run something in
my<00:07:17.139> fuel<00:07:17.440> to<00:07:17.710> clean<00:07:17.979> it<00:07:18.130> so<00:07:18.340> I<00:07:18.370> don't<00:07:18.790> think<00:07:19.090> I

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:19.449 
my fuel to clean it so I don't think I

00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:23.189 
my fuel to clean it so I don't think I
have<00:07:20.440> dirty<00:07:20.710> injectors<00:07:21.250> on<00:07:21.460> the<00:07:21.610> tip<00:07:21.820> side<00:07:22.199> so

00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 
have dirty injectors on the tip side so

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:25.770 
have dirty injectors on the tip side so
