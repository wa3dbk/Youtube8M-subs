that<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.439> actually<00:01:37.619> goes<00:01:37.799> out<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.549> acts

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
that it actually goes out and it acts

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.450 
that it actually goes out and it acts
like<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.090> person<00:01:39.720> now<00:01:40.259> what<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.470> means<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.250> is

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
like a person now what that means is is

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.670 
like a person now what that means is is
that<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.970> could<00:01:42.360> potentially<00:01:42.659> be<00:01:43.350> tracked

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
that that could potentially be tracked

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.069 
that that could potentially be tracked
back<00:01:43.979> at<00:01:44.340> some<00:01:44.850> point<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.240> time<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.689> your<00:01:45.810> IP

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
back at some point in time to your IP

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.620 
back at some point in time to your IP
which<00:01:46.649> means<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.070> clearing<00:01:48.000> cookies<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.540> ie

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
which means that clearing cookies and ie

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.929 
which means that clearing cookies and ie
changing<00:01:49.560> your<00:01:49.590> email<00:01:50.009> address<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.369> logins

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
changing your email address and logins

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.450 
changing your email address and logins
often<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.509> smart<00:01:52.170> thing<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.439> do<00:01:52.740> now<00:01:53.250> for

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
often is a smart thing to do now for

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.039 
often is a smart thing to do now for
those<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.640> us<00:01:53.850> who<00:01:54.060> are<00:01:54.149> going<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.390> be<00:01:54.450> extra

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
those of us who are going to be extra

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.560 
those of us who are going to be extra
extra<00:01:55.079> extra<00:01:55.549> cautious<00:01:56.549> we've<00:01:57.060> added<00:01:57.360> the

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
extra extra cautious we've added the

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.990 
extra extra cautious we've added the
capabilities<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.229> actually<00:01:58.770> use<00:01:58.979> proxies<00:01:59.700> and

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
capabilities to actually use proxies and

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.730 
capabilities to actually use proxies and
these<00:02:00.540> are<00:02:00.719> these<00:02:01.140> are<00:02:01.200> basically

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
these are these are basically

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.800 
these are these are basically
methodologies<00:02:02.670> where<00:02:02.880> you're<00:02:03.060> going<00:02:03.360> out<00:02:03.509> and

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
methodologies where you're going out and

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.230 
methodologies where you're going out and
using<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.530> browser<00:02:04.770> emulator<00:02:05.399> looking<00:02:06.090> like

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
using the browser emulator looking like

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.809 
using the browser emulator looking like
it's<00:02:06.420> all<00:02:06.570> coming<00:02:06.930> from<00:02:07.079> different<00:02:07.350> locations

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
it's all coming from different locations

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.639 
it's all coming from different locations
now<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:08.879> do<00:02:09.360> this<00:02:09.629> it's<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:10.020> really<00:02:10.229> simple

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
now to do this it's a really simple

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.790 
now to do this it's a really simple
format<00:02:11.629> you<00:02:12.629> simply<00:02:12.930> enable

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
format you simply enable

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.440 
format you simply enable
these<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.400> then<00:02:14.520> you're<00:02:14.640> going<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.820> go<00:02:15.030> ad

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
these and then you're going to go ad

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.970 
these and then you're going to go ad
brackets<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.380> you're<00:02:16.470> going<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.650> have<00:02:16.800> your

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
brackets and you're going to have your

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.350 
brackets and you're going to have your
IP<00:02:17.190> address<00:02:17.760> which<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.120> going<00:02:18.240> to<00:02:18.300> be

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
IP address which is going to be

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.440 
IP address which is going to be
something<00:02:18.660> like<00:02:18.930> this<00:02:19.100> and<00:02:20.270> then<00:02:21.270> you're

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
something like this and then you're

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.710 
something like this and then you're
going<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.600> have<00:02:21.690> your<00:02:22.110> porch<00:02:22.470> which<00:02:23.040> could<00:02:23.310> be

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
going to have your porch which could be

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.930 
going to have your porch which could be
four<00:02:24.720> digits<00:02:25.080> like<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.560> now<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:26.460> can<00:02:26.730> have<00:02:26.910> a

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
four digits like that now you can have a

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.520 
four digits like that now you can have a
whole<00:02:27.120> bunch<00:02:27.300> of<00:02:27.480> these<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:27.660> you<00:02:27.960> just<00:02:28.140> go<00:02:28.290> one

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
whole bunch of these and you just go one

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.130 
whole bunch of these and you just go one
after<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.920> other<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.340> add<00:02:30.150> in<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.660> proxies

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
after the other and add in the proxies

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.290 
after the other and add in the proxies
that<00:02:31.350> you<00:02:31.440> have<00:02:31.560> available<00:02:31.710> to<00:02:32.100> you<00:02:32.280> again<00:02:33.090> you

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
that you have available to you again you

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.240 
that you have available to you again you
don't<00:02:33.450> have<00:02:33.570> to<00:02:34.050> use<00:02:34.230> proxies<00:02:34.830> but<00:02:35.040> if<00:02:35.130> you

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
don't have to use proxies but if you

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.100 
don't have to use proxies but if you
choose<00:02:35.490> to<00:02:35.700> use<00:02:35.730> proxies<00:02:36.330> that's<00:02:36.600> how<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:36.810> set

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
choose to use proxies that's how you set

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.430 
choose to use proxies that's how you set
them<00:02:37.200> up<00:02:38.210> then<00:02:39.210> last<00:02:39.570> but<00:02:39.780> not<00:02:39.960> least<00:02:40.020> the

automatically when windows starts then

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.030 
automatically when windows starts then
we'll<00:02:57.570> talk<00:02:57.690> about<00:02:57.750> why<00:02:58.200> that's<00:02:58.440> a<00:02:58.620> factor

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
we'll talk about why that's a factor

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.160 
we'll talk about why that's a factor
it's<00:02:59.820> only<00:03:00.120> going<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:00.570> come<00:03:00.750> up<00:03:00.870> if<00:03:01.020> you're

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
going to use the tiered linking option

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.150 
going to use the tiered linking option
that's<00:03:03.180> up<00:03:03.330> here<00:03:03.540> that<00:03:03.720> we<00:03:03.810> talked<00:03:04.080> about<00:03:04.230> so

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
that's up here that we talked about so

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.800 
that's up here that we talked about so
if<00:03:05.280> you<00:03:05.400> do<00:03:05.610> choose<00:03:05.880> to<00:03:05.940> use<00:03:06.300> the<00:03:06.540> tiered

if you do choose to use the tiered
linking<00:03:07.230> option<00:03:07.620> it's<00:03:07.800> going<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.010> require

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
linking option it's going to require

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.190 
linking option it's going to require
some<00:03:08.340> scheduling<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.420> you're<00:03:09.750> going<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:09.960> need

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
some scheduling and you're going to need

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.570 
some scheduling and you're going to need
it<00:03:10.350> to<00:03:10.470> run<00:03:10.620> in<00:03:10.770> the<00:03:10.800> background<00:03:11.010> when<00:03:11.430> you

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
it to run in the background when you

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.580 
it to run in the background when you
start<00:03:11.850> your<00:03:11.970> computer<00:03:12.150> so<00:03:12.900> it<00:03:12.990> actually<00:03:13.170> has

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
start your computer so it actually has

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.650 
start your computer so it actually has
the<00:03:13.830> ability<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.220> turn<00:03:14.520> itself<00:03:14.880> on<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.360> run

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
the ability to turn itself on and run
