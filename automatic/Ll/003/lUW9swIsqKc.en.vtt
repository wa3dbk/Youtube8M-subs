00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.130
 Y 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:14.660
 Look, I usually work with 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:16.730
 a gift that a backpack that I have always 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.580
 used this is the second one that I have 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.130
 because they are quite resistant is a 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.260
 classic actually the backpack is something 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.390
 which leads in almost all the companions and 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.490
 compaÃ±eras I like especially the 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.500
 resistance that has the security of 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.370
 that I will not drop the equipment for 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:38.300
 I can hang side and run is easy 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.980
 to accelerate the entire interior since 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.550
 be open even by putting your hand 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:48.420
 on the side and taking out the material myself 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:51.690
 I use a canon 5d mar 2 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:56.010
 that also carries with me the strip I 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:01:00.200
 I usually use three lenses, always 50 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.120
 35 and 85 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.760
 it's always these three lenses that 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.200
 I wear the lenses are for me the basic 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.480
 for story 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.860
 35 to be able to work within the 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:17.000
 185 spaces for medium portraits 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.250
 distance and a 50 to stay in touch 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.790
 direct with the subject always optical 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.530
 fixed in no time used the zoom 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.840
 or the TV 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.830
 if I see that there is any situation in 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.060
 depends on the moment and I'm accompanied 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.009
 fast but I do not like it I like that the 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.049
 photo I think it 's the distance 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:39.710
 fundamental and everything that goes beyond 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:42.950
 of 85 for me it is already very far and everything 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.690
 that comes down from 35 is very open with the 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.080
 distance that maintains respect with the 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.090
 subject that maintains a language 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.460
 practically symmetrical, they are not 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.810
 all lenses very similar but above 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.299
 all emphasize on that in that the 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.550
 distance is fundamental for me it is created 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.320
 a totally different feeling 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.690
 brain works differently I think that 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:07.850
 each report or each story can be 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.140
 created by a different type of camera 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.390
 I think the important thing is that we 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.370
 let's know what we are using and 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.080
 why we use it then I have inside 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.730
 also that is the team that usually 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.550
 Always wear the I do not wear anything else 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.160
 came the battery charger is a 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.880
 battery inserted 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.100
 there came also another extra battery are two 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.740
 the batteries that I have then in a 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.660
 bag with 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.420
 with the cards he does not use either 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.590
 I have a bet of 8 arrivals 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.480
 more than 8 gigas I have and one of 16 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.040
 practically he only uses the because 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.530
 for reporting I do not usually shoot 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.080
 widely among all they go directly 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:51.010
 Take it even if you have to wait days 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:53.500
 hours and specifically toward toward what 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.360
 want directly I do not have the 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.720
 mobile phone charger that also carries 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.370
 because if I do not always lose it 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.950
 the lid of the camera 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.150
 and always a couple of batteries that in 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.090
 I do not know why I'm wearing it but 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.099
 There always carry three batteries 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.530
 or four in the backpack because neither 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.659
 used flash I do not know there was a time in the 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.879
 that I got to use flash but for 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:18.340
 a very concrete story that says of 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:20.829
 vertical images with flash strokes 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.950
 direct while I was walking the 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:26.159
 street an angular a 24 that I used in 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.959
 that time she did not use it and 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:30.819
 I was directly approaching by walking 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.910
 the streets of barcelona and I approached the 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:36.470
 subject that put him a flash to fix 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.270
 vertically all the time 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.980
 and since then I think I'm still carrying 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.150
 the batteries probably in case someone 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:46.940
 I need it because I already tell you 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.750
 and then nothing else, actually, I do not 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.430
 carry nothing more 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.849
 what I wear on the laptop computer 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:04:00.069
 when I move, I do not wait for a team 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.069
 photographic what you see
