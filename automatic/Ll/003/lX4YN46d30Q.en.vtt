00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:15.269
 Hello ladies and gentlemen with you 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.660
 moonshine today I want to tell you about 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.939
 one game called jail throne from 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.710
 jib mangum company frankly 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.570
 when I saw this game on which brand and 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.820
 For average ratings 44 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.010
 I thought that she had no interest in 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.929
 I represent will not but after reading 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.750
 comments from recognized experts 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.899
 somehow cool but not very easy 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.370
 claas 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.440
 thanks to the production of checks, I realized that I did not 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.200
 I can pass this game side and 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.059
 must do a review of rotting well 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.879
 Well dear friends will not pull 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.550
 cat by the eggs let's run as soon as possible 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.920
 this wonderful game after seeing this game 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.070
 casting field on squares and 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.500
 some incomprehensible wall I thought that 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.080
 it is something socks foot type the snake 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.000
 more down left there is scoring but 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.030
 why then i still have me what 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.920
 here you need to do as long as I do not understand I 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.780
 I know only then you can turn 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.900
 just left and right nothing else 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.630
 you can not do well, so I broke 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.820
 I still do not quite understand what is flying there 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.770
 on the background 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.049
 if the snake had any meaning i'm not 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.030
 I know I had to eat some square and 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.490
 whether it was impossible to crash the wall 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.210
 the tail here is my point 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.640
 no 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.299
 the only garbage is try not 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.369
 fall on the trail of these of yours here 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.150
 rivals and also you can’t touch yours 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.490
 footprint or walls oh well we see that 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.850
 Our two rivals broke us and we 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.399
 scored ten points as I understand 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.390
 here you need to stay alone to hold on 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.750
 until the last 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.850
 let's try to do it here are mine 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.860
 chosen ladies and gentlemen second level 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:04.400
 let's see what will be there 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.710
 well then we see nothing has changed 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.229
 absolutely nothing we appeared in the same 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.600
 place on the same field moreover we have 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.520
 as many enemies and they also appeared 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.680
 in the same place where we appeared 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.750
 in the first level still flies 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.910
 incomprehensible crap over us i don't understand 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.540
 what it is 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.580
 still apparently the developers of this game 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.830
 does not know what physics 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.550
 Well, yes, I can understand them because physics 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.470
 start to take place only in grade 7 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.230
 Look, for example, I turn but 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.170
 while absolutely not losing speed 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.230
 and turning instantly no 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.220
 physics in this game there are no features at all and yet 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.290
 this music I can not have it over 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.090
 In my budget of this game 10 rubles 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.160
 which developers have spent on 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.239
 Internet cafe to download these tracks from 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.230
 free website 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.970
 hell no, I just had nowhere to go 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.080
 I do not know maybe the meaning of this game 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.540
 be kamikaze 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.790
 and still the music ended the value we only 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.400
 supreme wonderful side and this 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.470
 the motorcycle it resembles the sound of my 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.380
 moped gasol on which I drove in 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.660
 third grade he has all the time west 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.500
 gas revenue therefore revolutions were always 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.110
 to maximum 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.510
 and he was constantly falling off 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.780
 brakes me that's why this game is me 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.090
 reminds me of my childhood when I'm with 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.250
 open throttle full 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.280
 rushed through the village I refused to brake 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.320
 and all I could do was turn 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.350
 I can't do it here either 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.080
 slow down the alphabet of this engine 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:41.030
 reminds me of the sound here is whether this gas 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.160
 besides, I don't quite understand why 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.010
 slow down when cornering 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.049
 the speed of this does not slow down playing 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.400
 still a little better 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.739
 ride in zigzags 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.769
 I got up easily to beat my 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.580
 rivals but from this game has become 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.140
 dumber 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.730
 it's like playing at 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.579
 tic-tac-toe with her three year old 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.230
 brother moron but still know what 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:06.560
 you play with him but for some reason 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.959
 continues to play further heated 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.680
 passion, I decided to see what will happen 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.739
 at the end of the game and after a few 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.889
 no and transitions between levels she just 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:22.780
 just hung just hung and more 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:26.370
 nothing is a complete ass 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:30.389
 it's complete nonsense oh well friends 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:34.509
 it's time to take stock know 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:37.840
 the main goal of the game is to entertain but this 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:40.150
 the game does not entertain me at all 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.039
 you can draw lines with success 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.110
 on a piece of paper or take the same 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:46.449
 write a piece of paper on all sides 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.930
 turn me around and sit all day and and 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:53.229
 more than that it seems to me that this 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.360
 game impudence and wives source some 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:57.460
 unfinished game because surely 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.050
 the idea of ​​the developers should be and 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:03.430
 graphics and surroundings and generally multiplayer 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.590
 let's say is there a game to play by 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.810
 the internet and your rivals won't 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.550
 stupid bots that can appear in 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.250
 only one place to turn into one 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:16.599
 point in the direction of a living people be 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:19.870
 maybe it would be interesting as well as the Greeks 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:21.729
 in the description thank you all for your attention 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.690
 subscribe to the channel put likes 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:24.690
