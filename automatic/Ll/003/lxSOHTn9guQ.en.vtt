absolutely<00:03:00.270> amazing<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.860> way<00:03:02.010> we<00:03:02.220> get<00:03:02.400> the

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
absolutely amazing the way we get the

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.340 
absolutely amazing the way we get the
adjustment<00:03:03.030> is<00:03:03.240> really<00:03:03.630> simple<00:03:03.990> you<00:03:04.080> can<00:03:04.200> see

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
adjustment is really simple you can see

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.949 
adjustment is really simple you can see
the<00:03:04.470> locator<00:03:04.860> pin<00:03:05.130> here<00:03:05.370> in<00:03:05.520> the<00:03:05.790> bar<00:03:05.970> okay<00:03:06.690> and

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
the locator pin here in the bar okay and

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.260 
the locator pin here in the bar okay and
the<00:03:07.140> reason<00:03:07.440> that's<00:03:07.620> there<00:03:07.950> is<00:03:08.550> quite<00:03:08.940> simply

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
the reason that's there is quite simply

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.840 
the reason that's there is quite simply
so<00:03:09.570> you<00:03:09.840> get<00:03:10.200> both<00:03:10.500> sides<00:03:10.850> perfectly

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
so you get both sides perfectly

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.930 
so you get both sides perfectly
consistent<00:03:12.209> that's<00:03:12.540> exactly<00:03:13.080> right<00:03:13.680> if<00:03:14.520> I

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
consistent that's exactly right if I

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.550 
consistent that's exactly right if I
have<00:03:15.090> a<00:03:15.120> tip<00:03:15.390> over<00:03:15.690> and<00:03:15.840> damage<00:03:16.140> a<00:03:16.260> bar<00:03:16.440> or

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
have a tip over and damage a bar or

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.080 
have a tip over and damage a bar or
something<00:03:16.920> can<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.100> can<00:03:17.400> i<00:03:17.459> buy<00:03:17.610> just<00:03:17.820> a<00:03:17.940> bar

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
something can I can i buy just a bar

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
challenging it seems every year they

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.900 
challenging it seems every year they
keep<00:03:43.830> squashing<00:03:44.400> them<00:03:44.519> a<00:03:44.550> little<00:03:44.760> bit<00:03:44.880> more

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
keep squashing them a little bit more

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.699 
keep squashing them a little bit more
they're<00:03:45.330> getting<00:03:45.540> tighter<00:03:45.780> for<00:03:46.050> sure<00:03:46.230> and

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
they're getting tighter for sure and

gravitating<00:04:18.030> towards<00:04:18.299> these<00:04:18.450> as<00:04:18.600> well<00:04:18.810> yeah

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
gravitating towards these as well yeah

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.560 
gravitating towards these as well yeah
well<00:04:20.040> they<00:04:20.220> can<00:04:20.370> adjust<00:04:20.669> it<00:04:20.790> up<00:04:20.910> high<00:04:21.060> too<00:04:21.120> so

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
well they can adjust it up high too so

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.850 
well they can adjust it up high too so
they're<00:04:21.720> not<00:04:21.870> as<00:04:21.989> hunched<00:04:22.260> over<00:04:22.380> for<00:04:22.710> long

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
they're not as hunched over for long

they're not as hunched over for long
rides<00:04:23.070> now<00:04:23.820> you<00:04:23.880> said<00:04:24.150> you've<00:04:24.300> actually<00:04:24.510> had

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
rides now you said you've actually had

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.700 
rides now you said you've actually had
some<00:04:25.169> some<00:04:25.710> Ducati<00:04:26.070> guys<00:04:26.310> that<00:04:26.640> we<00:04:26.790> were<00:04:27.210> going

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
some some Ducati guys that we were going

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.740 
some some Ducati guys that we were going
positive<00:04:28.710> positive<00:04:29.160> yeah<00:04:29.880> you<00:04:30.120> can<00:04:30.270> rotate<00:04:30.450> it

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
positive positive yeah you can rotate it

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.240 
positive positive yeah you can rotate it
on<00:04:30.840> an<00:04:30.990> 80<00:04:31.169> degrees<00:04:31.470> so<00:04:31.680> there's<00:04:31.860> actually

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
on an 80 degrees so there's actually

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.120 
on an 80 degrees so there's actually
eight<00:04:32.460> positions<00:04:33.620> some<00:04:34.620> of<00:04:34.710> the<00:04:34.770> others<00:04:34.979> are

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
eight positions some of the others are

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.589 
eight positions some of the others are
kind<00:04:35.310> of<00:04:35.490> I<00:04:35.700> would<00:04:35.760> almost<00:04:36.000> label<00:04:36.510> them

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
kind of I would almost label them

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:39.200 
kind of I would almost label them
unusable<00:04:36.930> however<00:04:37.800> you<00:04:38.520> know<00:04:38.610> if<00:04:38.729> you<00:04:38.849> look<00:04:39.030> at

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
unusable however you know if you look at

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.420 
unusable however you know if you look at
you<00:04:39.539> consider<00:04:39.900> your<00:04:40.110> fork<00:04:40.410> your<00:04:40.830> rake<00:04:41.010> angle

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
you consider your fork your rake angle

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.860 
you consider your fork your rake angle
right

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
right

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.510 
right
so<00:04:42.870> it<00:04:43.110> takes<00:04:43.289> this<00:04:43.559> bar<00:04:43.830> instead<00:04:44.279> of<00:04:44.370> having

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
so it takes this bar instead of having

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.029 
so it takes this bar instead of having
this<00:04:44.699> crazy<00:04:44.999> upward<00:04:45.629> swing<00:04:45.900> it<00:04:46.259> really

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
this crazy upward swing it really

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:49.219 
this crazy upward swing it really
changes<00:04:47.460> it<00:04:47.610> so<00:04:47.789> it's<00:04:48.180> just<00:04:48.330> a<00:04:48.539> little<00:04:48.930> above

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
changes it so it's just a little above

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:51.140 
changes it so it's just a little above
flat<00:04:49.620> that's<00:04:50.129> true<00:04:50.400> there's<00:04:50.669> actually<00:04:51.120> a

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
flat that's true there's actually a

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.899 
flat that's true there's actually a
three<00:04:51.629> inch<00:04:51.839> difference<00:04:52.229> from<00:04:53.159> full<00:04:53.610> bottom

00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:53.909 
three inch difference from full bottom

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:56.629 
three inch difference from full bottom
to<00:04:54.059> full<00:04:54.180> top<00:04:54.419> that's<00:04:55.110> quite<00:04:55.349> a<00:04:55.379> bit<00:04:55.620> and<00:04:55.949> you

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
to full top that's quite a bit and you

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.540 
to full top that's quite a bit and you
know<00:04:57.150> four<00:04:57.389> places<00:04:57.629> in<00:04:57.870> between<00:04:58.219> that's<00:04:59.219> quite

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
know four places in between that's quite

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:00.950 
know four places in between that's quite
a<00:04:59.580> bit<00:04:59.759> so<00:04:59.939> first<00:05:00.210> street<00:05:00.449> brighter<00:05:00.689> that

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
a bit so first street brighter that

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.589 
a bit so first street brighter that
could<00:05:01.110> be<00:05:01.259> a<00:05:01.550> pretty<00:05:02.550> sweet<00:05:02.699> advantage<00:05:03.240> and<00:05:03.479> if

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:03.599 
could be a pretty sweet advantage and if

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:04.939 
could be a pretty sweet advantage and if
nothing<00:05:03.779> else<00:05:03.960> you<00:05:04.139> can<00:05:04.259> try<00:05:04.379> it<00:05:04.499> if<00:05:04.680> you<00:05:04.770> hate

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:04.949 
nothing else you can try it if you hate

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:08.839 
nothing else you can try it if you hate
it<00:05:04.979> already<00:05:06.650> it's<00:05:07.650> pretty<00:05:07.919> easy<00:05:08.039> it's<00:05:08.400> not<00:05:08.669> the

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:08.849 
it already it's pretty easy it's not the

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:10.339 
it already it's pretty easy it's not the
end<00:05:08.969> of<00:05:08.999> the<00:05:09.089> world<00:05:09.270> they<00:05:09.449> sell<00:05:09.689> it<00:05:09.809> at<00:05:09.930> a<00:05:09.960> very

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349 
end of the world they sell it at a very

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:12.140 
end of the world they sell it at a very
affordable<00:05:10.499> price<00:05:11.099> point<00:05:11.400> church<00:05:11.699> stuff<00:05:11.939> like

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
affordable price point church stuff like

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.450 
affordable price point church stuff like
this<00:05:12.389> is<00:05:12.539> normally<00:05:13.080> you<00:05:13.800> know<00:05:13.889> I<00:05:13.919> would<00:05:14.430> say

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
this is normally you know I would say

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.040 
this is normally you know I would say
something<00:05:14.909> like<00:05:15.029> this<00:05:15.180> should<00:05:15.389> probably<00:05:15.659> be<00:05:16.020> a

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
something like this should probably be a

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.709 
something like this should probably be a
little<00:05:16.139> bit<00:05:16.499> closer<00:05:16.740> to<00:05:16.949> $200<00:05:17.580> well<00:05:18.360> we<00:05:18.509> tried

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:18.719 
little bit closer to $200 well we tried

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:21.139 
little bit closer to $200 well we tried
to<00:05:18.809> keep<00:05:18.930> the<00:05:19.080> price<00:05:19.289> point<00:05:20.029> equivalent<00:05:21.029> with

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:21.149 
to keep the price point equivalent with

00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:23.179 
to keep the price point equivalent with
anything<00:05:21.479> else<00:05:21.629> on<00:05:21.839> the<00:05:21.930> market<00:05:21.960> yeah<00:05:22.860> and<00:05:23.159> I

00:05:23.179 --> 00:05:23.189 
anything else on the market yeah and I

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:24.950 
anything else on the market yeah and I
think<00:05:23.249> you<00:05:23.639> know<00:05:23.699> your<00:05:23.969> advantage<00:05:24.419> there<00:05:24.659> you

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
think you know your advantage there you

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.329 
think you know your advantage there you
know<00:05:25.080> being<00:05:25.259> a<00:05:25.379> small<00:05:25.620> business<00:05:25.949> owner<00:05:26.069> is

00:05:26.329 --> 00:05:26.339 
know being a small business owner is

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:28.249 
know being a small business owner is
you're<00:05:26.490> able<00:05:26.669> to<00:05:26.699> control<00:05:27.539> the<00:05:27.689> overhead<00:05:28.110> and

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259 
you're able to control the overhead and

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:30.529 
you're able to control the overhead and
control<00:05:28.559> the<00:05:28.649> cost<00:05:28.889> absolutely<00:05:29.819> and<00:05:29.969> bring<00:05:30.389> us

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
control the cost absolutely and bring us
