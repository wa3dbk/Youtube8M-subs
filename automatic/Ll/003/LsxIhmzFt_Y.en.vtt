hey guys welcome back here's another fun

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.579 
hey guys welcome back here's another fun
thing<00:00:07.480> you<00:00:07.840> can<00:00:07.990> do<00:00:08.109> with<00:00:08.320> the<00:00:08.530> fence<00:00:09.160> gates

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:10.589 
thing you can do with the fence gates

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:14.520 
thing you can do with the fence gates
now<00:00:11.589> with<00:00:11.919> redstone<00:00:12.280> power<00:00:12.749> I<00:00:13.749> have<00:00:14.110> a<00:00:14.139> set<00:00:14.440> of

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:14.530 
now with redstone power I have a set of

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.440 
now with redstone power I have a set of
four<00:00:14.769> gates<00:00:15.009> here<00:00:15.280> and<00:00:15.490> let's<00:00:15.909> say<00:00:16.059> you<00:00:16.119> have<00:00:16.420> a

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:16.450 
four gates here and let's say you have a

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.810 
four gates here and let's say you have a
mob<00:00:16.929> spawner<00:00:17.140> or<00:00:17.740> something<00:00:18.340> that<00:00:18.550> you<00:00:18.640> want

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:18.820 
mob spawner or something that you want

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.279 
mob spawner or something that you want
to<00:00:18.910> sort<00:00:19.210> your<00:00:19.769> mobs<00:00:21.509> humanoid<00:00:22.509> mobs<00:00:22.810> you

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289 
to sort your mobs humanoid mobs you

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:24.540 
to sort your mobs humanoid mobs you
could<00:00:23.410> open<00:00:23.619> that<00:00:23.679> gate<00:00:24.039> and<00:00:24.220> let<00:00:24.310> the

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
could open that gate and let the

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.810 
could open that gate and let the
humanoid<00:00:24.939> mobs<00:00:25.240> through<00:00:25.599> all<00:00:26.170> the<00:00:27.070> spiders

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
humanoid mobs through all the spiders

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.769 
humanoid mobs through all the spiders
would<00:00:28.269> get<00:00:28.509> stuck<00:00:30.179> if<00:00:31.179> you<00:00:31.359> wanted<00:00:31.599> only

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
would get stuck if you wanted only

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.600 
would get stuck if you wanted only
spiders<00:00:32.380> to<00:00:32.529> come<00:00:32.710> through<00:00:33.010> you<00:00:33.250> would<00:00:33.370> open

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
spiders to come through you would open

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.880 
spiders to come through you would open
up<00:00:33.700> the<00:00:33.850> bottom<00:00:34.120> one<00:00:34.300> and<00:00:34.739> someone<00:00:35.739> pointed

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
up the bottom one and someone pointed

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.750 
up the bottom one and someone pointed
out<00:00:36.160> on<00:00:36.309> the<00:00:36.460> last<00:00:36.850> video<00:00:37.090> where<00:00:37.570> I<00:00:37.629> said<00:00:38.170> that

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
out on the last video where I said that

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.040 
out on the last video where I said that
having<00:00:39.760> just<00:00:40.120> the<00:00:40.180> two<00:00:40.420> bottom<00:00:40.629> gates

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
having just the two bottom gates

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.279 
having just the two bottom gates
wouldn't<00:00:41.590> keep<00:00:41.710> out<00:00:41.890> the<00:00:42.070> spires<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:44.110> is

00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:44.289 
wouldn't keep out the spires that is

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:48.750 
wouldn't keep out the spires that is
true<00:00:44.590> because<00:00:45.039> they<00:00:45.280> these<00:00:45.940> are<00:00:46.410> 1.5<00:00:47.410> tall<00:00:48.100> but

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
true because they these are 1.5 tall but

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.150 
true because they these are 1.5 tall but
the<00:00:48.969> spiders<00:00:49.329> will<00:00:49.660> come<00:00:50.020> through<00:00:50.289> here<00:00:50.680> I<00:00:50.859> did

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
the spiders will come through here I did

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.420 
the spiders will come through here I did
it<00:00:51.280> before<00:00:52.410> they<00:00:53.410> don't<00:00:53.620> want<00:00:53.949> to<00:00:54.070> go<00:00:54.219> through

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
it before they don't want to go through

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.099 
it before they don't want to go through
there<00:00:54.609> you<00:00:55.210> kind<00:00:55.390> of<00:00:55.420> have<00:00:55.539> to<00:00:55.570> force<00:00:55.930> them

00:00:56.099 --> 00:00:56.109 
there you kind of have to force them

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:58.020 
there you kind of have to force them
through<00:00:56.289> with<00:00:56.410> water<00:00:56.710> they<00:00:57.100> think<00:00:57.370> that<00:00:57.430> it's

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
through with water they think that it's

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.509 
through with water they think that it's
a<00:00:58.500> barrier<00:00:59.500> so<00:00:59.800> they<00:00:59.920> don't<00:01:00.070> really<00:01:00.250> want<00:01:00.460> to

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
a barrier so they don't really want to

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:02.819 
a barrier so they don't really want to
go<00:01:00.609> through<00:01:00.850> but<00:01:01.030> if<00:01:01.660> you<00:01:01.780> have<00:01:01.960> water<00:01:02.260> forcing

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
go through but if you have water forcing

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.249 
go through but if you have water forcing
them<00:01:02.980> through<00:01:03.219> they<00:01:03.460> will<00:01:03.960> continue<00:01:04.960> on

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
them through they will continue on

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.749 
them through they will continue on
through<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.900> that<00:01:07.930> should<00:01:08.710> work<00:01:08.740> fine<00:01:09.189> if<00:01:09.549> you

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
through so that should work fine if you

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.480 
through so that should work fine if you
wanted<00:01:10.270> cave<00:01:11.140> spiders<00:01:11.650> for<00:01:11.860> whatever<00:01:12.159> reason

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
wanted cave spiders for whatever reason

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.630 
wanted cave spiders for whatever reason
you<00:01:12.610> could<00:01:12.790> just<00:01:13.060> open<00:01:13.240> one<00:01:13.450> corner<00:01:13.960> of<00:01:14.020> it<00:01:14.110> or

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
you could just open one corner of it or

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.880 
you could just open one corner of it or
if<00:01:15.640> you<00:01:15.759> need<00:01:15.880> at<00:01:16.030> all<00:01:16.150> of<00:01:16.420> them<00:01:16.990> open<00:01:17.259> do<00:01:17.770> it

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
if you need at all of them open do it

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.240 
if you need at all of them open do it
like<00:01:17.979> that<00:01:18.040> so<00:01:18.759> this<00:01:19.659> array<00:01:20.020> here<00:01:20.350> is<00:01:20.470> not<00:01:21.130> the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
like that so this array here is not the

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.859 
like that so this array here is not the
only<00:01:21.310> way<00:01:21.579> you<00:01:21.640> could<00:01:21.820> wire<00:01:22.030> up<00:01:22.270> but<00:01:22.479> it's<00:01:22.600> the

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
only way you could wire up but it's the

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.780 
only way you could wire up but it's the
simplest<00:01:23.640> visual<00:01:24.640> way<00:01:24.909> I<00:01:24.939> could<00:01:25.439> could<00:01:26.439> have

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
simplest visual way I could could have

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.120 
simplest visual way I could could have
shown<00:01:27.790> you<00:01:27.820> how<00:01:28.150> it's<00:01:28.360> done<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:29.710> humanoid

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
shown you how it's done the humanoid

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.590 
shown you how it's done the humanoid
mobs<00:01:30.420> has<00:01:31.420> two<00:01:31.750> torches<00:01:32.110> that<00:01:32.380> are<00:01:32.500> only<00:01:33.600> going

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
mobs has two torches that are only going

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.940 
mobs has two torches that are only going
to<00:01:34.720> the<00:01:34.810> right<00:01:34.960> side<00:01:35.170> there<00:01:35.409> and<00:01:35.710> then<00:01:36.570> spiders

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
to the right side there and then spiders

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
to the right side there and then spiders
obviously<00:01:38.950> they<00:01:39.130> get<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:39.460> two<00:01:39.610> middle<00:01:39.850> ones

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
obviously they get the two middle ones

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.679 
obviously they get the two middle ones
can<00:01:40.390> go<00:01:40.540> on<00:01:40.659> the<00:01:41.259> two<00:01:41.409> bottom<00:01:41.590> ones<00:01:41.710> and<00:01:42.689> then

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689 
can go on the two bottom ones and then

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.740 
can go on the two bottom ones and then
cave<00:01:44.500> only<00:01:44.860> has<00:01:45.009> one<00:01:45.250> torch<00:01:45.549> and<00:01:45.909> then<00:01:46.030> all

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
cave only has one torch and then all

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.770 
cave only has one torch and then all
files<00:01:47.500> all<00:01:47.950> so

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
files all so

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.060 
files all so
jump<00:01:52.909> so<00:01:53.909> if<00:01:54.060> you're<00:01:54.179> doing<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.859> mob<00:01:55.859> spawner

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
jump so if you're doing a mob spawner

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.700 
jump so if you're doing a mob spawner
and<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.549> needed<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.810> sort<00:01:58.140> them<00:01:58.380> for<00:01:58.590> some

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
and you needed to sort them for some

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.219 
and you needed to sort them for some
reason<00:01:58.740> maybe<00:01:59.369> have<00:02:01.909> some<00:02:02.909> mobs<00:02:03.179> go<00:02:03.869> one<00:02:04.049> way

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
reason maybe have some mobs go one way

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.199 
reason maybe have some mobs go one way
on<00:02:04.259> some<00:02:04.619> mobs<00:02:04.890> go<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.219> other<00:02:05.280> way<00:02:05.429> I<00:02:05.700> suppose

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:06.209 
on some mobs go the other way I suppose

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:13.910 
on some mobs go the other way I suppose
you<00:02:07.079> could<00:02:07.229> do<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:07.879> so<00:02:09.229> cool<00:02:10.670> so<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.760> guess
