00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:20.120
"My name is Jean-Paul Armache.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:26.680
I'm postdoc at Professor Yifan Cheng's lab
who is an expert in cryoelectron microscopy.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:36.290
I spend my time trying to figure out how nature
works in molecular detail.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:45.440
Difference between a healthy human being and
a person who has anemia or has some issues

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:53.860
with growth and so on might lie in one very
tiny thing on the molecular scale.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:00.280
Basically, on a large scale, it's significant,
but on a tiny scale, very drastic.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:08.700
The changes of behavior over a very small
thing, which in turn step by step, it causes

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.659
all the other things to change how they work.

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.259
It's like an engine.

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:21.069
One small screw is going to change the way
the whole engine sounds and eventually the

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:26.049
whole car is going to stop because things
don't work together.

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:31.759
Examining things on a very tiny scale might
seem like an insignificant and very tedious

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:39.389
job, but if it leads to one person out of
one million not having issues in the future,

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:41.749
it's already worth it.

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:47.960
What motivates me to wake up and go to work
and do what I do is ... There are several

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.600
reasons for that.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.079
First thing is you are the first one to know
what others don't know.

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:01.350
You are going to learn something new which
probably no one else in the world has yet

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.889
discovered.

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:14.750
The second motivation is I do feel that every
person owes a certain debt to the society.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:22.890
The rationale behind all that we do should
be trying to push our knowledge in order to

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.540
make less and less people suffer.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:32.420
In the future, we won't have to deal with
things like stillborn children or old people

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:40.920
having dementia or viruses decimating the
population or like the recent outbreak of

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.030
Ebola.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.730
Thanks to biotechnology and researchers, thanks
to their work, there is an experimental drug

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.690
that can help.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:57.060
I came here from a lovely country of Poland
in Central Europe.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.700
You might detect that from beautiful accent.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:10.470
My journey to get where I am was non-standard,
maybe it is standard in the US.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.129
I was always interested in science in terms
of studying.

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:17.640
I loved reading.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.120
I loved literature.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.480
I disassembled radios.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.010
I loved puzzles.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.660
I liked looking into engines and so on.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.890
Science is interesting in terms ... Once you
learn about one thing ... It's like looking

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:36.900
through Wikipedia.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:43.360
You read one article, and then there's a hyperlink
to another article and you keep on reading

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.420
and reading and reading.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.280
It's like a never-ending cycle.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.670
If you can't keep yourself interested in one
thing, you will definitely like science.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:01.040
Of course, you have to learn how to be very
patient because science is not a bunch of

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.210
people sitting together in one screaming eureka.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:11.580
A successful researcher should be patient,
patient and inquisitive.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.650
Ambition also doesn't hurt.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.289
Some people are ambitious because they don't
like to give up.

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:17.289
It's the stubbornness.

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:27.360
I think you have to have a quality of a boxing
person.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.439
You're getting hit.

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:31.710
You're getting the blows, but you are not
giving up.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:40.689
I was taught by my Polish teacher that it's
important to leave some legacy behind you

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:45.289
whether it's the legacy of your children like
some people choose.

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:46.440
That's a beautiful thing.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.490
There's a legacy of creating beautiful art
works.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.850
There's a legacy of being a great doctor,
of a great engineer.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:07.729
I chose to work on something that hopefully,
a very small part, when I leave this world,

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:35.680
it's going to leave even a tiny contribution.
