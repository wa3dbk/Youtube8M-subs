 There was a time, kawaii, go to the shit. 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.860
 I think this is something less English than 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:58.200
 people do not know anything exploded 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.290
 It's something that moves us 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.950

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.200
 This is serious click on the map and half 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.570
 This sucks the motherboard, not the people. 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:45.460

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:50.800
 anyone who has read here wants to know that 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:54.160
 that plaque of cosan is that it fails in 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:03:02.250
 four episodes field there the gastronomer 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:02.250
 time sheet was possible 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:11.290
 It's okay, it'll cost you to take your 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:19.959
 reward is that of OPEC 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:22.600

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.800
 to break things do not have this here is 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:29.470

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:59.110

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.760

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.100
 when in four episodes that this here 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.400
 in the episode for me the law is ugly 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:09.300
 horizon was not the sunrise that 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.300
 giant slime 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:21.460

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.430
 Sergio Lima , 31, only because the 2nd 

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:29.350
 adventure is not 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:38.949
 so I think it's 3 that's going to launch a 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:41.650
 point something is not knowing if life 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:48.819

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:55.030

00:05:51.009 --> 00:06:06.240

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:14.729
 It's better to be beautiful, it's going to be beautiful. 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:14.729
