all those hurdles and get to a design

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.189 
all those hurdles and get to a design
that<00:04:45.270> we<00:04:45.539> could<00:04:45.690> actually<00:04:45.870> get<00:04:46.139> to

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 
that we could actually get to

that we could actually get to
construction<00:04:46.830> was<00:04:47.669> a<00:04:47.699> very<00:04:48.210> large<00:04:48.539> task<00:04:48.900> when

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
construction was a very large task when

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:50.570 
construction was a very large task when
you<00:04:49.650> look<00:04:49.800> at<00:04:49.889> the<00:04:49.979> amount<00:04:50.009> of<00:04:50.220> topography

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
you look at the amount of topography

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.850 
you look at the amount of topography
that<00:04:50.910> we<00:04:51.150> had<00:04:51.330> over<00:04:51.660> 50<00:04:52.110> feet<00:04:52.320> of<00:04:52.349> fall<00:04:52.650> in<00:04:52.680> the

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
that we had over 50 feet of fall in the

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.950 
that we had over 50 feet of fall in the
site<00:04:53.220> and<00:04:53.520> how<00:04:53.639> to<00:04:53.699> build<00:04:54.000> in<00:04:54.180> spaces<00:04:54.780> that

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
site and how to build in spaces that

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.749 
site and how to build in spaces that
were<00:04:55.110> just<00:04:55.259> beautiful<00:04:55.830> where<00:04:56.190> people<00:04:56.580> could

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:56.759 
were just beautiful where people could

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:59.600 
were just beautiful where people could
celebrate<00:04:57.120> and<00:04:57.570> laugh<00:04:57.780> and<00:04:58.199> and<00:04:58.460> get<00:04:59.460> to<00:04:59.580> know

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
celebrate and laugh and and get to know

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.129 
celebrate and laugh and and get to know
each<00:04:59.849> other<00:05:00.030> better<00:05:00.330> and<00:05:00.830> was<00:05:01.830> a<00:05:01.860> huge<00:05:02.810> idea<00:05:03.810> of

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 
each other better and was a huge idea of

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:05.870 
each other better and was a huge idea of
our<00:05:04.440> premise<00:05:04.860> behind<00:05:05.039> the<00:05:05.370> entire<00:05:05.610> project

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
our premise behind the entire project

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.790 
our premise behind the entire project
and<00:05:06.510> I<00:05:06.960> think<00:05:07.169> they're<00:05:07.260> probably<00:05:07.380> one<00:05:07.650> of<00:05:07.680> the

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
and I think they're probably one of the

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.350 
and I think they're probably one of the
key<00:05:07.919> things<00:05:08.190> was<00:05:08.400> coming<00:05:08.699> up<00:05:08.789> with<00:05:08.940> the<00:05:09.030> idea

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
key things was coming up with the idea

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.149 
key things was coming up with the idea
of<00:05:09.419> these<00:05:09.659> cottages<00:05:10.110> that<00:05:10.320> SAT<00:05:10.710> up<00:05:10.830> here<00:05:11.039> on

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:11.159 
of these cottages that SAT up here on

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:12.649 
of these cottages that SAT up here on
the<00:05:11.250> upper<00:05:11.520> terrace<00:05:11.909> and<00:05:12.060> that<00:05:12.180> they<00:05:12.300> were<00:05:12.360> the

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:12.659 
the upper terrace and that they were the

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:14.930 
the upper terrace and that they were the
main<00:05:12.840> meeting<00:05:13.139> spaces<00:05:13.560> so<00:05:14.039> the<00:05:14.220> city<00:05:14.400> has<00:05:14.639> one

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
main meeting spaces so the city has one

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.330 
main meeting spaces so the city has one
and<00:05:15.240> the<00:05:15.810> seniors<00:05:16.139> have<00:05:16.349> their<00:05:16.590> lounge<00:05:16.800> and
