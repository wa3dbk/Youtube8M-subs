00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
if I don't kill them they're gonna then

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.970 
if I don't kill them they're gonna then
attack<00:04:02.750> me<00:04:02.959> and<00:04:03.230> then

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
attack me and then

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.250 
attack me and then
we<00:04:04.250> go<00:04:04.370> back<00:04:04.580> to<00:04:04.790> the<00:04:04.940> strategy<00:04:05.690> portion<00:04:06.080> where

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
we go back to the strategy portion where

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.600 
we go back to the strategy portion where
then<00:04:06.410> we<00:04:06.560> start<00:04:06.770> maneuvering<00:04:06.950> troops<00:04:07.340> again

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
then we start maneuvering troops again

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.030 
then we start maneuvering troops again
on<00:04:07.900> project<00:04:08.900> cross<00:04:09.020> zone<00:04:09.290> you<00:04:10.160> have<00:04:10.190> kind<00:04:10.640> of<00:04:10.730> a

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
on project cross zone you have kind of a

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.400 
on project cross zone you have kind of a
kind<00:04:13.040> of<00:04:13.099> a<00:04:13.160> real-time<00:04:13.819> battle<00:04:14.750> element<00:04:15.200> of

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
kind of a real-time battle element of

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.259 
kind of a real-time battle element of
when<00:04:15.680> you<00:04:15.770> go<00:04:15.890> into<00:04:16.040> battle<00:04:16.430> and<00:04:16.579> I<00:04:16.910> thought<00:04:17.120> it

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
when you go into battle and I thought it

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.020 
when you go into battle and I thought it
allows<00:04:17.510> the<00:04:17.840> player<00:04:18.169> to<00:04:18.500> be<00:04:18.530> able<00:04:18.739> to<00:04:19.030> execute

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
allows the player to be able to execute

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.000 
allows the player to be able to execute
different<00:04:20.359> combos<00:04:20.959> and<00:04:21.200> based<00:04:21.470> on<00:04:21.620> the<00:04:21.739> timing

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
different combos and based on the timing

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.500 
different combos and based on the timing
of<00:04:22.370> their<00:04:22.550> attacks<00:04:22.880> and<00:04:23.150> the<00:04:23.210> different

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
of their attacks and the different

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.450 
of their attacks and the different
combos<00:04:23.810> they're<00:04:24.020> doing<00:04:24.350> they<00:04:24.740> can<00:04:24.770> do<00:04:25.040> extra

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
combos they're doing they can do extra

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.120 
combos they're doing they can do extra
damage<00:04:25.490> and<00:04:26.300> you<00:04:27.260> know<00:04:27.350> super<00:04:27.740> powerful

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
damage and you know super powerful

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.760 
damage and you know super powerful
attacks<00:04:28.430> but<00:04:29.240> it<00:04:29.540> doesn't<00:04:29.930> turn<00:04:30.139> into<00:04:30.200> a

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
attacks but it doesn't turn into a

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.610 
attacks but it doesn't turn into a
action<00:04:31.760> game<00:04:32.000> where<00:04:32.630> then<00:04:32.990> the<00:04:33.290> strategy

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
action game where then the strategy

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.409 
action game where then the strategy
completely<00:04:34.250> goes<00:04:34.430> away<00:04:34.460> if<00:04:34.880> you<00:04:35.030> have<00:04:35.210> a

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
completely goes away if you have a

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.200 
completely goes away if you have a
hundred<00:04:35.660> percent<00:04:35.780> full<00:04:36.260> control<00:04:36.650> over<00:04:37.430> the

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
hundred percent full control over the

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.480 
hundred percent full control over the
outcome<00:04:38.419> of<00:04:38.690> that<00:04:38.840> battle<00:04:39.380> by<00:04:39.710> how<00:04:40.190> good<00:04:40.340> you

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
outcome of that battle by how good you

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.610 
outcome of that battle by how good you
are<00:04:40.550> in<00:04:41.000> you<00:04:41.540> know<00:04:41.570> in<00:04:41.810> timing<00:04:42.260> the<00:04:42.350> attacks

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
are in you know in timing the attacks

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.560 
are in you know in timing the attacks
and<00:04:42.950> kind<00:04:43.400> of<00:04:43.460> like<00:04:43.700> playing<00:04:44.000> it<00:04:44.150> almost<00:04:44.450> an

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
and kind of like playing it almost an

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.350 
and kind of like playing it almost an
action<00:04:44.900> game<00:04:45.080> so<00:04:45.590> it<00:04:45.800> kind<00:04:46.070> of<00:04:46.190> does<00:04:46.580> a<00:04:46.610> mix<00:04:47.000> in

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
action game so it kind of does a mix in

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.230 
action game so it kind of does a mix in
between<00:04:48.310> giving<00:04:49.310> the<00:04:49.430> player<00:04:49.639> a<00:04:49.669> little<00:04:50.090> bit

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
between giving the player a little bit

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.060 
between giving the player a little bit
of<00:04:50.360> the<00:04:50.479> chance<00:04:50.780> to<00:04:51.080> feel<00:04:51.710> like<00:04:51.889> they're

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
of the chance to feel like they're

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.129 
of the chance to feel like they're
controlling<00:04:52.550> the<00:04:52.760> action<00:04:53.150> you<00:04:54.020> know

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139 
controlling the action you know

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:56.409 
controlling the action you know
unleashing<00:04:54.680> the<00:04:54.800> attacks<00:04:55.130> themselves<00:04:55.850> but

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
unleashing the attacks themselves but

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.800 
unleashing the attacks themselves but
still<00:04:56.840> keeping<00:04:57.530> to<00:04:57.770> that<00:04:58.570> strategy<00:04:59.570> I<00:04:59.600> guess

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
still keeping to that strategy I guess

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.780 
still keeping to that strategy I guess
like<00:05:00.260> framework<00:05:00.950> that<00:05:01.130> you<00:05:01.280> have<00:05:01.460> when<00:05:01.700> you

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
like framework that you have when you

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.400 
like framework that you have when you
have<00:05:01.820> these<00:05:02.090> tactical<00:05:02.690> RPGs

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.309
