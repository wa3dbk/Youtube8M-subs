00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.990
 hi friends, how are you going to prepare 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.960
 some ravioli with tomato vinaigrette and 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.990
 capers for this recipe we will use 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.190
 a ravioli barque 4 cheeses 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:21.029
 wheaton and anchovies capers basil 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:24.390
 fresh tomato olive oil and vinegar 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.439
 of sherry to start I'll grate the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.770
 tomato we have cut them in half 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:35.190
 let's go scratching with a grater 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:39.120
 in total we are going to put 2 tomatoes and we have 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.470
 to choose the tomato that is red that 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.870
 be mature 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.740
 The better the tomato, the better 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.740
 the notebook will come out 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:56.950
 next we chop the anchovies 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:00.690
 4 in total we extend them 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.690
 and we explain it finely 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.930
 we introduce them into the bowl with the 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:12.420
 tomato and we keep biting the capers 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.460
 It is important that the caper is well 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.190
 drained since if you can not leave us 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.540
 a lot of flavor and alter the 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.540
 final result of the sauce 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.740
 and finally the fresh basil 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.740
 we play 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:39.580
 we give all and follow 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:42.150
 chopping we make a juliana well row 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.590
 and the knife that cuts well to avoid 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.530
 to take the game out and we can 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.200
 darken the basil we turn of two 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.530
 cuts we have already totally chopped the 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.530
 basil 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:59.810
 to finish the sauce we need to add 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.810
 olive oil 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.750
 a good splash of sherry vinegar 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.780
 and a pinch of blood 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.560
 you have to watch because you already have the 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:17.760
 anchovy and we can not pass 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.760
 we mix it well 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.210
 and now we 're going to let it rest in the 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.220
 30 minutes fridge 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.840
 now let's cook the ravioli 4 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.510
 wheaton cheeses and following the 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.510
 Packing instructions 5 minutes 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:38.320
 we add a pinch of salt and the 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.150
 let cook 5 minutes following the 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.860
 Packing instructions is 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.080
 convenient that the water of the pasta 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.660
 when it is filled as is this case of 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.720
 the ravioli or tortellini has to boil 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.490
 gently to keep from breaking 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.250
 and now we will cover the pasta and 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:57.310
 let cool a few minutes and 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:01.180
 we have the cold pasta and we're going to 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.060
 Mix it with the tomato vinaigrette 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.900
 very careful 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.900
 mix 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.300
 and we would only have to place 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.570
 and as a decorative touch since it is a 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.900
 Very Mediterranean and aromatic dish 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:25.870
 we put a forest of fresh herbs a 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:29.110
 trickle of olive oil and already 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.600
 would ready our plate 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.880
