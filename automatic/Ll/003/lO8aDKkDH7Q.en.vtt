I<00:02:00.360> really<00:02:00.570> believe<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:00.840> ermon<00:02:01.619> lane<00:02:01.649> a

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
I really believe that ermon lane a

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.410 
I really believe that ermon lane a
little<00:02:02.100> bit<00:02:02.189> higher<00:02:02.340> ceiling<00:02:02.820> maybe<00:02:03.240> not

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
little bit higher ceiling maybe not

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.880 
little bit higher ceiling maybe not
quite<00:02:03.659> as<00:02:03.719> polished<00:02:03.990> but<00:02:04.290> another<00:02:04.469> five-star

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
quite as polished but another five-star

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.020 
quite as polished but another five-star
receive<00:02:05.219> they<00:02:05.340> grabbed<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.729> out<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.909> the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
receive they grabbed it out of the

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.119

homestead<00:02:06.390> area<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.840> former<00:02:07.409> Florida<00:02:07.890> commit

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
homestead area a former Florida commit

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.309 
homestead area a former Florida commit
there<00:02:08.310> right<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:09.090> think<00:02:09.569> he<00:02:09.690> also<00:02:09.810> has<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.050> chance

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
there right I think he also has a chance

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.720 
there right I think he also has a chance
to<00:02:10.379> play<00:02:10.560> early<00:02:10.770> maybe<00:02:10.950> not<00:02:11.129> quite<00:02:11.310> as<00:02:11.370> much<00:02:11.580> as

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
to play early maybe not quite as much as

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.100 
to play early maybe not quite as much as

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.400 
injury and I think he has a chance of
that<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:35.850> do<00:02:36.000> have<00:02:36.090> Carlos<00:02:36.390> Williams<00:02:36.570> who<00:02:36.840> may

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
that I do have Carlos Williams who may

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.810 
that I do have Carlos Williams who may
be<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.530> little<00:02:37.650> bit<00:02:37.800> difficult<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.190> receipt<00:02:38.610> and

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
be a little bit difficult to receipt and

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.850 
ridiculous angle and then be a business
that<00:04:00.180> guy<00:04:00.330> looks<00:04:00.540> silly<00:04:00.750> and<00:04:01.590> that's<00:04:01.770> the

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
that guy looks silly and that's the

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.350 
that guy looks silly and that's the
state<00:04:02.100> title<00:04:02.250> game<00:04:02.430> against<00:04:02.730> arm<00:04:02.910> would<00:04:03.090> in<00:04:03.300> a

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
state title game against arm would in a

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.090 
state title game against arm would in a
really<00:04:03.660> really<00:04:03.840> high<00:04:04.050> classification<00:04:04.740> for

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
really really high classification for

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.980 
really really high classification for
these<00:04:05.340> not<00:04:05.520> some<00:04:05.760> scrub<00:04:06.060> teams<00:04:06.330> right<00:04:06.720> he's

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:06.990 
these not some scrub teams right he's

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.540 
these not some scrub teams right he's
playing<00:04:07.290> it<00:04:07.470> so<00:04:07.620> I<00:04:07.650> think<00:04:07.830> a<00:04:08.040> guy<00:04:08.190> that<00:04:08.220> needs

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
playing it so I think a guy that needs

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.610 
playing it so I think a guy that needs
to<00:04:08.640> learn<00:04:08.910> additional<00:04:09.240> more<00:04:09.750> not<00:04:10.260> probably

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
to learn additional more not probably

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.110 
to learn additional more not probably
work<00:04:10.770> on<00:04:10.950> it<00:04:11.070> is<00:04:11.220> blocking<00:04:11.610> has<00:04:11.730> had<00:04:11.910> to<00:04:12.000> block

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
work on it is blocking has had to block

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.180 
work on it is blocking has had to block
a<00:04:12.180> whole<00:04:12.420> lot<00:04:12.600> I<00:04:13.020> do<00:04:13.350> like<00:04:13.590> how<00:04:13.709> he<00:04:13.770> catches<00:04:14.010> the

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
a whole lot I do like how he catches the

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.130 
a whole lot I do like how he catches the
football<00:04:14.580> uh<00:04:14.790> and<00:04:15.540> there's<00:04:15.720> really<00:04:16.049> a

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
football uh and there's really a

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.780 
football uh and there's really a
smoother<00:04:16.530> get<00:04:16.770> open<00:04:17.010> it<00:04:17.100> when<00:04:17.340> he<00:04:17.400> when<00:04:17.700> he's

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
smoother get open it when he when he's

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.000 
smoother get open it when he when he's
in<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.000> open<00:04:18.209> field<00:04:18.359> he<00:04:19.080> has<00:04:19.200> the<00:04:19.230> Jets<00:04:19.650> I

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
in the open field he has the Jets I

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.440 
in the open field he has the Jets I
think<00:04:20.520> if<00:04:20.609> he<00:04:20.730> can<00:04:20.880> become<00:04:21.120> a<00:04:21.150> little<00:04:21.209> more

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
think if he can become a little more

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.270 
think if he can become a little more
patient<00:04:21.930> instinctive<00:04:22.410> inside<00:04:22.710> right<00:04:23.100> you're

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
patient instinctive inside right you're

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.170 
patient instinctive inside right you're
looking<00:04:23.460> at<00:04:23.580> her

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180
