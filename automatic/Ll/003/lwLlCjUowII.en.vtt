00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello to all of you today I 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.450
 will show you how we do 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:12.809
 wheel of a bike so to start you 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:15.120
 lightning or hateful pompaire so that on 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:22.970
 the pump rc for hen is done 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:25.769
 get out there you have the bars 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.670
 and normally it goes no further 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:37.290
 a bike it goes up to 30 the wheel of a 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:40.980
 bike then you have the tip slept 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.170
 I hold it the wrong way you for 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.730
 inflate the bike wheel you will not have 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.940
 need only the big boom and then 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.710
 is useless then you have the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.140
 crank behind who is tending you 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.600
 will allow when you get it from 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.949
 stay hooked to tab for not 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.710
 that your end this tongue bar 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.219
 so now is we going to move to the 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.990
 convenient 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:13.409
 so for a start you take the 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:16.710
 tongue and you divide the cap of 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:21.930
 plugs looks like that then you 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:25.500
 take the tip and you put it on 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:31.439
 the big end on the gold 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:33.590
 the tongue and you hurry to put to 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.380
 pull the level 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:41.549
 now you can see that 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:43.200
 more withdrawn while if I put the 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.040
 manual at its starting point I can 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:52.740
 do not care what I'm asking you 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:55.710
 then I'm going to show so pulled to 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.140
 take it like that and you 'll get off 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.430
 and you do that until your or 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:12.710
 be hard enough so 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:13.910
 paul ney me here I am the tough ones but 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.290
 it's because I had already inflated 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.530
 before that not to make you wait very 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.270
 a long time so normally you have to 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.980
 do that at least fifty 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.959
 times for them to inflate your so 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.490
 then you hurry to remove the 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.380
 the adapter the air pump for not 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.170
 clear at all clear that you put 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.610
 in the wheel escapes and put 8 your 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:39.410
 easter plugs no longer look 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:42.880
