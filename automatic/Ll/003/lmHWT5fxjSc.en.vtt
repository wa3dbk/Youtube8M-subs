00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 that's basically three devices in one 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:09.000
 Turnaround section we have a lot 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.110
 Sophisticated monitor section and that 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.440
 third device is then, so to speak 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.440
 interface 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:21.890
 this sequence is presented by zoom 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.480
 hello and welcome to the 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.250
 magazine for musicians my name is 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.570
 Florian Selzer and I am here at the booth 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.600
 from spl with the budget 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.160
 hello please what can you tell us here 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.490
 demonstrate 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:37.360
 So that 's a completely new one for us 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:42.680
 This is the first box 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:45.880
 interface with usb connection and is 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.110
 our attempt with our philosophy 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.690
 just our five cents of truth the 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.320
 Let's wish to contribute are 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.560
 Found three devices in one if one 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.540
 projection 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.750
 we have a very sophisticated 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.829
 Monitor section and the third device is 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.090
 then almost the interface 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.520
 You can also do the thing standalone 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.390
 That's why we have that again 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:12.590
 Mentioned we have two microphones here 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:15.520
 inputs with the teams from our 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.509
 gamestation so our high class 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.399
 that means they are equipped 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:23.720
 things here are the microphone preamps 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:25.789
 really great and again two layman 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.550
 inputs and we still have two spd 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:31.490
 So we have six inputs and then 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.149
 you can see two monitors behind 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.940
 connect 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.520
 so we have almost four outputs and 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.630
 through it and through different ones 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.190
 attitudes and courageous possibilities 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.509
 You can do it yourself by tricks us 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.039
 have that on our website too 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.380
 have made diagrams 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.450
 You can stop over a few detours as well 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.080
 still inserts do it right 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.929
 analogue in the heart and old came 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.720
 we have two headphones outputs it is 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:58.310
 very good if you work together and 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.060
 then we can both wear headphones 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.679
 of course, then have the 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.300
 possibility that in the next room in the 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:03.920
 grind the recording room and so on 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.679
 You can talk about routings then too 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.890
 a talkback functionality 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.180
 functionality 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:14.060
 yes that was the word somehow together 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:16.960
 twirl and we have back again 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.880
 3 1 creep paths for external 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.710
 music sources so a turntable we 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.110
 have a mini jack behind for ipod 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.970
 or for an iphone or something like that again 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.360
 xls klinken rcs we have abe 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.520
 Comparative possibilities one 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.150
 Dimming function , one knows reasonably 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:39.310
 talk to each other would like to test mono 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.310
 you can do it in channel 12 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:46.370
 of course 48 volt that is also one of the 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.410
 reasons why the thing is not usb bus 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.500
 is powered but we have again 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.250
 power supply added because usb would be then 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.980
 to say so much 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.900
 and then these devices catch on internally 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.400
 to think about what you need less 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.690
 electricity because somehow that must be 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.860
 Energy management yes, then work 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.750
 is to be said again 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.980
 external stream to it so the 48 want 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.290
 the whole thing really works 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.880
 clan and that is now virtually under our 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.370
 try to lay his eggs want me 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.790
 at our level for what we are 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.290
 to know 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:19.070
 price availability it can to what is 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.330
 tell availability is now so 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.920
 he 'll be out already 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.990
 the war thomann and everywhere worldwide 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.880
 you get that and price 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:31.160
 street price now I'll stop it 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:33.200
 owns 499 492 the box that is bid 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.790
 the way and the wind also good when it 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.080
 so that's him completely made in 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.830
 germany as nix somehow I change 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.910
 ausgesorgt 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:45.220
 this will be hand in hand at sgl in the company 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:47.420
 lace and that is extreme 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.800
 Resistant here you can on tour 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.870
 take it at all no problem there 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.700
 can i know about that 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.920
 we have to try it but there stops 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.110
 a lot and sounds really cool 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.460
 So the testers turn over what 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.570
 We are of course very proud of ourselves 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.140
 does what we view this as 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.070
 continue around 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.070
 we'll look at to
