what<00:01:19.870> now<00:01:20.080> settings<00:01:20.700> can<00:01:21.700> do<00:01:21.850> that<00:01:22.090> up<00:01:22.390> to

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
what now settings can do that up to

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
what now settings can do that up to
about<00:01:23.050> 15<00:01:23.680> more<00:01:23.830> seconds<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:26.020> package<00:01:26.530> itself

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
about 15 more seconds the package itself

not placing any process models we would

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.050 
not placing any process models we would
keep<00:01:38.570> Probie<00:01:39.570> three<00:01:39.810> but<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.140> previously<00:01:41.060> but

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
control of the environment so we don't

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.950 
control of the environment so we don't
have<00:02:04.110> any<00:02:04.290> openings<00:02:04.650> anywhere<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:06.210> we<00:02:06.840> don't

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
developed a new technique we call it

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.790 
developed a new technique we call it
perfect<00:03:44.170> God<00:03:44.700> patent<00:03:45.700> pending<00:03:46.110> and<00:03:47.110> it<00:03:47.230> gives

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
perfect God patent pending and it gives

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.300 
perfect God patent pending and it gives
a<00:03:47.890> lot<00:03:48.010> more<00:03:48.250> stable<00:03:49.470> stable<00:03:50.470> temperature

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
a lot more stable stable temperature
