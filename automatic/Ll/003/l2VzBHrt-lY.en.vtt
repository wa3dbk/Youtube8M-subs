using so in this particular case we're
using<00:00:20.660> this<00:00:21.660> tank<00:00:22.189> when<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:23.340> tank<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.850> empty

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
using this tank when this tank is empty

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.310 
using this tank when this tank is empty
as<00:00:26.130> long<00:00:26.430> as<00:00:26.670> both<00:00:26.849> tanks<00:00:27.150> are<00:00:27.390> open

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
internally when this tank runs out it'll

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.010 
internally when this tank runs out it'll
automatically<00:00:35.460> in<00:00:35.760> sight<00:00:36.059> it'll<00:00:36.390> change<00:00:36.690> and

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
automatically in sight it'll change and

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.170 
automatically in sight it'll change and
start<00:00:37.290> drawing<00:00:37.680> gas<00:00:37.950> from<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.430> tank<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:39.149> that

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
start drawing gas from this tank so that

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.049 
start drawing gas from this tank so that
everything<00:00:39.690> continues<00:00:40.230> running<00:00:40.879> this<00:00:41.879> will

everything continues running this will

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.560 
everything continues running this will
turn<00:00:42.239> red<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.540> indicate<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.440> tank<00:00:43.770> is

turn red to indicate that this tank is

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.790 
turn red to indicate that this tank is
empty<00:00:45.570> simply<00:00:46.469> turn<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:46.860> tank<00:00:47.100> off<00:00:48.800> open

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
empty simply turn this tank off open

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.760 
empty simply turn this tank off open
this<00:00:49.920> up<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.719> you<00:00:51.719> can<00:00:51.750> take<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.260> tank<00:00:52.530> off

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
this up and you can take this tank off

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.549 
this up and you can take this tank off
and<00:00:53.100> go<00:00:53.340> have<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.730> filled<00:00:54.079> take<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.289> lever

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
and go have it filled take this lever

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.869 
and go have it filled take this lever
and<00:00:56.000> turn<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.149> around<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:58.050> points<00:00:58.879> to

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
and turn it around so that it points to

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.540 
and turn it around so that it points to
your<00:01:00.059> other<00:01:00.239> tank<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:01.559> everything<00:01:02.430> will

continue going while you take this tank

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.490 
continue going while you take this tank
down<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.570> have<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.869> filled<00:01:07.110> if<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:08.010> notice<00:01:08.460> a

gas leaking out of this tube after
disconnecting<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:15.290> then<00:01:16.290> there's<00:01:16.500> something

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
disconnecting it then there's something

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.370 
disconnecting it then there's something
internally<00:01:17.729> wrong<00:01:17.970> with<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:18.450> this<00:01:18.810> should

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
internally wrong with this this should

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.719 
internally wrong with this this should

mistake of putting this in the center if

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.460 
mistake of putting this in the center if
you<00:01:48.030> put<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:48.540> in<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.810> center<00:01:49.170> you're

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
you put this in the center you're

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.260 
you put this in the center you're
actually<00:01:49.860> going<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.040> be<00:01:50.159> drying<00:01:50.460> gas<00:01:50.820> from

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
actually going to be drying gas from

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.319 
actually going to be drying gas from
both<00:01:51.540> tanks<00:01:52.549> so<00:01:53.549> by<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.759> time<00:01:54.090> you're

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
both tanks so by the time you're

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.230 
both tanks so by the time you're
actually<00:01:54.540> out<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.229> gas<00:01:55.470> both<00:01:56.430> tanks<00:01:56.850> are<00:01:57.090> out

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
actually out of gas both tanks are out

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.300 
actually out of gas both tanks are out
of<00:01:57.420> gas<00:01:57.630> at<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:57.930> same<00:01:58.020> time<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.890> everything

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
of gas at the same time and everything

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.940 
of gas at the same time and everything
is<00:01:59.340> going<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.640> shut<00:01:59.880> down<00:01:59.960> you<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.380> have<00:02:01.710> no

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
is going to shut down you you have no

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.230 
is going to shut down you you have no
indication<00:02:02.700> as<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:05.250> levels<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.820> your<00:02:05.939> tank

so<00:02:06.540> always<00:02:07.259> make<00:02:07.500> sure<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.799> this<00:02:08.129> lever<00:02:08.429> is

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
so always make sure that this lever is

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.650 
so always make sure that this lever is
too

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
too

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.760
