the<00:01:49.500> outside<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.009> if<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.220> look<00:01:50.430> at<00:01:50.549> our<00:01:50.700> our

channel within alpha color its
fluctuating<00:01:56.159> away<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:57.240> see<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.420> little<00:01:57.540> bar

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
fluctuating away you see a little bar

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.679 
fluctuating away you see a little bar
moving<00:01:57.990> down<00:01:58.140> there<00:01:58.729> and<00:01:59.729> if<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.329> look<00:02:00.479> at<00:02:00.600> our

moving down there and if you look at our
actual<00:02:00.840> image<00:02:01.460> on<00:02:02.460> our<00:02:02.670> production<00:02:02.820> monitor

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
actual image on our production monitor

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.870 
actual image on our production monitor
I'll<00:02:04.049> just<00:02:04.259> bring<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.740> detail<00:02:05.369> back<00:02:05.579> in

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
I'll just bring that detail back in

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.950 
I'll just bring that detail back in
there<00:02:06.030> into<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.270> whites<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.719> can<00:02:06.810> see

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
there into the whites and you can see

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.389 
there into the whites and you can see
that<00:02:07.140> coming<00:02:07.350> back<00:02:07.530> up<00:02:07.770> if<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:07.950> work<00:02:08.099> in<00:02:08.280> the

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
that coming back up if I work in the

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.850 
that coming back up if I work in the
luminance<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.209> mid-tone<00:02:09.629> I<00:02:09.840> can<00:02:09.989> also<00:02:10.110> use

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
luminance of the mid-tone I can also use

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.290 
luminance of the mid-tone I can also use
the<00:02:11.009> scroll<00:02:11.310> wheel<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.520> really<00:02:11.940> bring<00:02:12.180> out

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
the scroll wheel to really bring out

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.000 
the scroll wheel to really bring out
some

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
some

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.070 
some
the<00:02:13.190> detail<00:02:13.550> there<00:02:13.730> now<00:02:14.270> this<00:02:14.420> is<00:02:14.510> obviously

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
the detail there now this is obviously

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.320 
the detail there now this is obviously
being<00:02:15.290> shot<00:02:15.590> on<00:02:15.770> an<00:02:15.890> iPhone<00:02:16.220> 4<00:02:16.520> so<00:02:16.879> it's<00:02:17.150> not

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
being shot on an iPhone 4 so it's not

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.580 
being shot on an iPhone 4 so it's not
going<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.540> be<00:02:17.629> high<00:02:17.750> quality<00:02:18.200> but<00:02:18.319> this<00:02:18.440> is

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
going to be high quality but this is

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.800 
going to be high quality but this is
just<00:02:18.739> for<00:02:18.830> illustrative<00:02:19.310> purposes<00:02:19.629> so<00:02:20.629> this

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
just for illustrative purposes so this

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.520 
just for illustrative purposes so this
is<00:02:21.019> a<00:02:21.050> really<00:02:21.650> nice<00:02:22.160> little<00:02:22.730> small<00:02:23.120> device<00:02:23.530> an

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
is a really nice little small device an

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.580 
is a really nice little small device an
app<00:02:24.769> it<00:02:25.760> makes<00:02:25.970> it<00:02:26.180> easy<00:02:26.330> for<00:02:26.450> just<00:02:27.319> being<00:02:27.500> able

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
app it makes it easy for just being able

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.270 
app it makes it easy for just being able
to<00:02:27.680> quickly<00:02:27.950> make<00:02:28.640> changes<00:02:28.700> on<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.300> fly<00:02:29.390> and

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
to quickly make changes on the fly and

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.259 
to quickly make changes on the fly and
definitely<00:02:31.280> if<00:02:31.459> you<00:02:31.610> really<00:02:31.970> want<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:32.180> get

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
definitely if you really want to get

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:33.280 
definitely if you really want to get
serious<00:02:32.450> about<00:02:32.660> it<00:02:32.780> you<00:02:32.900> should<00:02:33.050> get<00:02:33.170> the

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
serious about it you should get the

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.809 
serious about it you should get the
actual<00:02:33.650> tangent<00:02:34.069> Consul<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:34.459> hopefully

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
actual tangent Consul and hopefully

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:35.500 
actual tangent Consul and hopefully
they'll<00:02:34.940> be<00:02:35.000> coming<00:02:35.269> out<00:02:35.360> with<00:02:35.480> another

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
they'll be coming out with another

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.180 
they'll be coming out with another
version<00:02:35.959> of<00:02:36.140> this<00:02:36.260> that<00:02:36.319> isn't<00:02:36.680> light<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.099> has

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
version of this that isn't light and has

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.250 
version of this that isn't light and has
a<00:02:37.220> few<00:02:37.550> more<00:02:37.700> operations<00:02:38.420> like<00:02:38.569> secondaries

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
a few more operations like secondaries

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.870 
a few more operations like secondaries
and<00:02:39.410> primary<00:02:39.709> outs<00:02:39.860> but<00:02:40.459> for<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:40.670> time<00:02:40.849> being

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
and primary outs but for the time being

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.839 
and primary outs but for the time being
it's<00:02:41.360> a<00:02:41.480> really<00:02:41.930> good<00:02:42.110> tool<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:42.760> thanks<00:02:43.760> for
