a little too hard that first half

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:08.970 
a little too hard that first half
because<00:00:07.779> everyone<00:00:08.230> knew<00:00:08.379> what<00:00:08.709> was<00:00:08.799> online

was right that they were going to make

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.099 
was right that they were going to make
those<00:00:41.739> plays<00:00:41.949> and<00:00:42.370> we<00:00:43.329> we<00:00:43.780> got<00:00:43.929> some<00:00:44.079> great
