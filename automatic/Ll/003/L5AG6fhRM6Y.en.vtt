at<00:01:56.870> the<00:01:56.930> same<00:01:57.020> time<00:01:57.230> he<00:01:57.710> elevated<00:01:58.280> it<00:01:58.610> like

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
at the same time he elevated it like

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.050 
at the same time he elevated it like
levels<00:01:59.630> above<00:02:00.110> we<00:02:00.530> kind<00:02:00.740> of<00:02:00.830> looked<00:02:01.340> back<00:02:01.850> a

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
levels above we kind of looked back a

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.080 
levels above we kind of looked back a
lot<00:02:02.300> I<00:02:02.680> not<00:02:03.680> necessarily<00:02:04.280> what<00:02:04.460> we<00:02:04.610> were<00:02:04.760> doing

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
lot I not necessarily what we were doing

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.480 
lot I not necessarily what we were doing
but<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.390> way<00:02:05.540> we<00:02:05.720> were<00:02:05.840> doing<00:02:06.140> things

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
but the way we were doing things

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.010 
but the way we were doing things
thinking<00:02:07.490> about<00:02:07.580> what<00:02:07.760> you<00:02:08.090> have<00:02:08.390> around<00:02:08.509> you

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
thinking about what you have around you

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.620 
thinking about what you have around you
making<00:02:09.979> things<00:02:10.190> out<00:02:10.310> of<00:02:10.369> trash<00:02:10.670> bags<00:02:10.700> that's

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
making things out of trash bags that's

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.600 
making things out of trash bags that's
kind<00:02:11.870> of<00:02:11.930> where<00:02:12.110> I<00:02:12.140> started<00:02:12.680> and<00:02:12.860> it's<00:02:13.040> kind<00:02:13.400> of

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
kind of where I started and it's kind of

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.880 
kind of where I started and it's kind of
nice<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.060> bring<00:02:14.540> that<00:02:14.780> to<00:02:14.960> powers<00:02:15.200> because<00:02:15.470> I'm

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
nice to bring that to powers because I'm

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.650 
nice to bring that to powers because I'm
very<00:02:16.070> looking<00:02:16.460> that<00:02:16.640> I<00:02:16.730> kind<00:02:17.000> of<00:02:17.030> have<00:02:17.210> a<00:02:17.240> big

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
very looking that I kind of have a big

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.840 
very looking that I kind of have a big
chance<00:02:17.930> to<00:02:18.110> play<00:02:18.290> around<00:02:18.500> so<00:02:18.920> we<00:02:19.340> just<00:02:19.520> may<00:02:19.820> be
