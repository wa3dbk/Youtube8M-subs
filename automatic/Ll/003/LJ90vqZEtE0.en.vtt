 we are starting 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:14.010
 Today we will discuss what the best is , 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.060
 the most important part of a photo something 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:20.189
 so have the intro 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.289

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.340
 321 hello guys and very good today 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.230
 we will talk about what is the most 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.000
 important part of a photo the most 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.250
 important of a photo for many is 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.650
 that there is no noise for others is a 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.989
 spectacular framing to others can be 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.320
 the exposure the focus the sharpness or the 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.900
 mouth 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.329
 but after having gone through everything and 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.130
 well not for everything because surely not 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.170
 I've gone through some of the hobbies but 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.520
 we all have our harmony this much 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.590
 people have the noise mania other 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.320
 framing people we all have 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.200
 our manias and according to the mania that 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.400
 we have then is the most important part 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.800
 of a photo now 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.780
 after several years in photography 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.620
 I think they came to a conclusion 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.020
 that the increase seems to me the most logical and 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.110
 is the following the part of a part 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.900
 most important of a photo is rather 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:35.530
 the concept or the message that was 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.330
 and all the rest let's say everything that is 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.270
 technical as far as the light approach and 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:46.840
 crispness bokeh noise made everything 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.680
 is what helps you carry this 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.860
 better message 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.350
 who sees the photo but the content more 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.830
 important of the photo is the concept the 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.960
 idea the message that it carries and can be and 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.080
 ok but all the photos have 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.210
 a message not yes but the idea is to put 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.300
 a very clear message before doing the 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.180
 picture and work and even if it takes 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.330
 make 500 photos to finally have a 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.240
 only one that transmits precisely the 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.640
 message that you wanted some have seen 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.050
 some of my photos that where yes 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.500
 who applied this technique first 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.690
 think of a concrete concept and then 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.490
 create the photograph around this 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.220
 idea here I show you some photos 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:37.030
 decisions that I made for this purpose do not 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.350
 working in this way and I think I think 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.090
 which is the most important part of the 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.790
 photo because the photograph at the end and 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.069
 cape 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.409
 if it's a photo technically very very very 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.599
 correct if you teach it to someone who 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:51.209
 does not understand photography can you say no 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.700
 I like it and if it's a photo technically 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.760
 very very bad but that spends a 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.680
 very very very good moment is taught to 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.230
 someone who does not understand photographs and 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.239
 what will happen of photo I do not think that good 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.420
 because what people see is actually 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.939
 the message and not so much the technical side 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.790
 we think so much about it in the noise 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:16.220
 but more in what expresses the photo more 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.950
 in the concrete moment more in everything 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.650
 together but in order to carry this 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.630
 message to the other person to the person 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.520
 that will see the photo does not matter if it is a 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.830
 through a screen through the 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:31.040
 paper in which this company the photo or 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.320
 mobile screen does not matter but 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.820
 you have to convey this message of 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.890
 agreement this has been the video for today 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.840
 I hope you liked it I invite you 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.090
 to reflect a little on this subject 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.220
 think about when to start a session 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.260
 before starting a session think about 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.510
 for example I want to do a session that 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:53.330
 express melancholy or I want to make a 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:56.840
 session that expresses sadness or joy or 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.850
 love but not always a thing so that 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.950
 we can know different ways of 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.090
 work in fine agreement thank you for 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.520

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.530
