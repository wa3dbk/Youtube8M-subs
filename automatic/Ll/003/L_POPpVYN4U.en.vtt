signature corridor I four was built in

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.759 
signature corridor I four was built in
the<00:00:49.280> early<00:00:49.579> 60s<00:00:50.150> it<00:00:50.930> wasn't<00:00:51.290> built<00:00:51.440> to<00:00:51.500> handle

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
the early 60s it wasn't built to handle

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:53.619 
the early 60s it wasn't built to handle
the<00:00:51.980> volume<00:00:52.579> of<00:00:52.699> traffic<00:00:52.970> that<00:00:53.300> it<00:00:53.420> handles

the volume of traffic that it handles

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.020 
the volume of traffic that it handles
today<00:00:54.199> so<00:00:54.710> what<00:00:54.920> we're<00:00:55.070> going<00:00:55.280> to<00:00:55.370> do<00:00:55.579> is<00:00:55.790> not

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
today so what we're going to do is not

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.829 
today so what we're going to do is not
just<00:00:56.540> add<00:00:56.750> the<00:00:57.170> express<00:00:57.710> lanes<00:00:58.690> we're<00:00:59.690> gonna

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839 
just add the express lanes we're gonna

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:02.410 
just add the express lanes we're gonna
reconstruct<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:00.890> entire<00:01:01.010> I<00:01:01.519> four<00:01:01.820> corridor
