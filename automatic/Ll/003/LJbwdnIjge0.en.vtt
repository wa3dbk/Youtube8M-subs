is<00:01:27.430> this<00:01:27.729> if<00:01:28.060> we<00:01:29.020> hear<00:01:29.409> explanations<00:01:30.369> that

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
is this if we hear explanations that

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.580 
is this if we hear explanations that
this<00:01:30.729> is<00:01:30.850> a<00:01:30.880> natural<00:01:31.119> event<00:01:31.630> common<00:01:32.320> sense

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
this is a natural event common sense

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.130 
this is a natural event common sense
dictates<00:01:33.220> that<00:01:33.430> that's<00:01:33.640> unlikely<00:01:34.090> if<00:01:34.570> this

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
dictates that that's unlikely if this

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.600 
dictates that that's unlikely if this
was<00:01:35.320> a<00:01:35.350> natural<00:01:35.770> event<00:01:36.040> then<00:01:36.280> it<00:01:36.400> should<00:01:36.580> have

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
was a natural event then it should have

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.780 
was a natural event then it should have
been<00:01:36.790> filmed<00:01:37.180> for<00:01:37.509> decades<00:01:38.140> and<00:01:38.790> discussed

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
been filmed for decades and discussed

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.090 
been filmed for decades and discussed
the<00:01:40.060> whole<00:01:40.210> time<00:01:40.509> if<00:01:40.750> this<00:01:40.869> was<00:01:41.140> a<00:01:41.409> normal

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
the whole time if this was a normal

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.609 
the whole time if this was a normal
magnetic<00:01:42.640> way<00:01:42.820> the<00:01:43.270> normal<00:01:43.780> effect<00:01:44.140> of<00:01:44.350> solar

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
magnetic way the normal effect of solar

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.130 
magnetic way the normal effect of solar
flares<00:01:45.150> these<00:01:46.150> things<00:01:46.390> have<00:01:46.570> been<00:01:46.600> looked<00:01:46.960> at

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
flares these things have been looked at

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.469 
flares these things have been looked at
by<00:01:47.320> the<00:01:47.380> way<00:01:47.470> and<00:01:47.890> not<00:01:48.189> matched<00:01:48.490> up<00:01:48.790> the<00:01:48.820> solar

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
by the way and not matched up the solar

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.200 
by the way and not matched up the solar
flares<00:01:49.810> anyhow<00:01:50.200> so<00:01:50.860> I<00:01:51.159> wanted<00:01:51.549> to<00:01:51.700> say<00:01:51.909> that

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
flares anyhow so I wanted to say that

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.340 
flares anyhow so I wanted to say that
about<00:01:52.780> the<00:01:53.439> lunar<00:01:54.009> clip<00:01:54.840> at<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:56.020> end<00:01:56.170> of<00:01:56.290> the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
about the lunar clip at the end of the

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.219 
about the lunar clip at the end of the
day<00:01:56.880> we<00:01:57.880> will<00:01:58.060> probably<00:01:58.600> have<00:01:58.780> to<00:01:58.810> figure<00:01:59.170> out

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
day we will probably have to figure out

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.999 
day we will probably have to figure out
what<00:01:59.470> this<00:01:59.590> is<00:01:59.829> on<00:02:00.070> our<00:02:00.340> own<00:02:00.490> so<00:02:01.329> if<00:02:02.049> you<00:02:02.829> see

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
what this is on our own so if you see

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:04.920 
what this is on our own so if you see
the<00:02:03.159> dismissive<00:02:03.640> people<00:02:03.970> come<00:02:04.180> you<00:02:04.540> know<00:02:04.750> who

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
they are not giving this effect or this

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.929 
they are not giving this effect or this

and if you go look up the etymology of

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.159 
and if you go look up the etymology of
the<00:02:52.370> word<00:02:52.549> belief<00:02:53.000> you'll<00:02:53.269> find<00:02:53.540> out<00:02:53.719> that<00:02:54.049> it

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:54.169 
the word belief you'll find out that it

00:02:54.169 --> 00:03:00.039 
the word belief you'll find out that it
was<00:02:54.199> originally<00:02:57.819> hand-in-hand<00:02:58.819> with<00:02:59.239> with

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
was originally hand-in-hand with with

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.270 
was originally hand-in-hand with with
faith<00:03:00.349> and<00:03:00.650> religion<00:03:01.510> but<00:03:02.510> I<00:03:02.810> would<00:03:03.530> make<00:03:04.099> this

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
faith and religion but I would make this

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.939 
faith and religion but I would make this
comparison<00:03:04.750> belief<00:03:05.750> is<00:03:05.959> a<00:03:05.989> bit<00:03:06.260> like<00:03:06.469> being<00:03:06.500> in

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:06.949 
comparison belief is a bit like being in

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:09.729 
comparison belief is a bit like being in
love<00:03:07.269> when<00:03:08.269> you<00:03:08.389> love<00:03:08.689> somebody<00:03:09.049> when<00:03:09.620> you're

you've been presented with things that

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:34.719 
you've been presented with things that
may<00:03:33.349> have<00:03:33.530> led<00:03:33.739> you<00:03:33.889> to<00:03:33.919> believe<00:03:34.159> it

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:34.729 
may have led you to believe it

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:37.119 
may have led you to believe it
but<00:03:34.970> the<00:03:35.209> truth<00:03:35.540> is<00:03:35.840> that<00:03:36.109> when<00:03:36.709> you<00:03:36.799> believe

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:37.129 
but the truth is that when you believe

but the truth is that when you believe
in<00:03:37.159> something<00:03:37.759> you<00:03:37.790> can<00:03:38.090> no<00:03:38.239> longer

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
in something you can no longer

is why they're doing it and it comes
down<00:04:16.789> to<00:04:17.000> one<00:04:17.239> word<00:04:17.530> control<00:04:18.699> that's<00:04:19.699> what

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000

easier for that individual or those

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.000

that has a foundation in error and it is

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.560 
that has a foundation in error and it is
that<00:05:30.170> simple

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
that simple

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.450

ok<00:05:32.570> so<00:05:32.870> you<00:05:32.930> may<00:05:33.140> ask<00:05:33.350> what<00:05:33.740> all<00:05:34.010> this<00:05:34.190> has<00:05:34.430> to

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
ok so you may ask what all this has to

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.990 
ok so you may ask what all this has to
do<00:05:34.730> with<00:05:34.760> the<00:05:35.000> lunar<00:05:35.180> wave<00:05:35.590> and<00:05:36.590> I<00:05:37.280> believe<00:05:37.850> it

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
do with the lunar wave and I believe it

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.850 
do with the lunar wave and I believe it
has<00:05:38.120> a<00:05:38.150> direct<00:05:38.540> relation<00:05:39.020> all<00:05:39.230> this<00:05:39.560> stuff

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
has a direct relation all this stuff

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.440 
has a direct relation all this stuff
interrelates<00:05:40.460> and<00:05:40.700> I<00:05:40.730> believe<00:05:41.030> the<00:05:41.180> lunar

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450 
interrelates and I believe the lunar

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.010 
interrelates and I believe the lunar
wave<00:05:41.600> footage<00:05:42.080> was<00:05:43.210> us<00:05:44.210> catching<00:05:44.810> them<00:05:44.990> with

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
wave footage was us catching them with

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.300 
wave footage was us catching them with
their<00:05:45.320> pants<00:05:45.590> down<00:05:45.740> that's<00:05:46.460> what<00:05:46.760> I<00:05:46.820> think<00:05:48.310> we

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
their pants down that's what I think we

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:50.980 
their pants down that's what I think we
won't<00:05:49.460> know<00:05:49.670> for<00:05:49.700> sure<00:05:49.910> until<00:05:50.390> we<00:05:50.810> determine

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
won't know for sure until we determine

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.190 
won't know for sure until we determine
what<00:05:51.470> exactly<00:05:51.590> these<00:05:52.100> waves<00:05:52.370> are<00:05:52.610> but<00:05:53.570> I<00:05:53.870> have

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.200 
what exactly these waves are but I have

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.280 
what exactly these waves are but I have
every<00:05:54.530> reason<00:05:54.710> to<00:05:54.860> believe<00:05:55.040> that<00:05:56.050> they<00:05:57.050> did

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:57.290 
every reason to believe that they did

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.870 
every reason to believe that they did
not<00:05:57.440> want<00:05:57.740> me<00:05:57.830> to<00:05:57.920> see<00:05:58.160> this<00:05:58.370> and<00:05:58.580> I<00:05:58.640> base<00:05:58.850> this

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 
not want me to see this and I base this

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.200 
not want me to see this and I base this
on<00:05:59.890> the<00:06:00.890> ongoing<00:06:01.100> attacks<00:06:01.820> that<00:06:02.060> have

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
on the ongoing attacks that have

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:03.880 
on the ongoing attacks that have
happened<00:06:02.390> since<00:06:02.750> the<00:06:02.960> first<00:06:03.140> time<00:06:03.290> I<00:06:03.350> posted

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:03.890 
happened since the first time I posted

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.770 
happened since the first time I posted
it<00:06:04.040> about<00:06:04.370> the<00:06:04.490> third<00:06:04.700> video<00:06:04.970> on<00:06:05.120> my<00:06:05.360> channel<00:06:05.690> I

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
it about the third video on my channel I

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.320 
it about the third video on my channel I
think<00:06:05.960> something<00:06:06.290> like<00:06:06.350> that<00:06:06.670> the<00:06:07.670> responses

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 
think something like that the responses

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.450 
think something like that the responses
I've<00:06:08.480> had<00:06:08.690> the<00:06:08.870> emails<00:06:09.350> I've<00:06:09.590> had<00:06:09.830> they<00:06:10.430> all

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
I've had the emails I've had they all

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.040 
I've had the emails I've had they all
point<00:06:11.120> to<00:06:12.040> they<00:06:13.040> wish<00:06:13.280> this<00:06:13.720> footage<00:06:14.720> didn't

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
point to they wish this footage didn't

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.500 
point to they wish this footage didn't
exist<00:06:15.410> and<00:06:15.740> now<00:06:15.950> we<00:06:16.010> have<00:06:16.370> 9<00:06:16.730> clips<00:06:17.150> that

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:17.510 
exist and now we have 9 clips that

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.110 
exist and now we have 9 clips that
confirm<00:06:17.960> we<00:06:18.680> know<00:06:18.860> for<00:06:19.040> a<00:06:19.070> fact<00:06:19.250> this<00:06:19.520> exists

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
confirm we know for a fact this exists

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.510 
confirm we know for a fact this exists
so<00:06:21.110> I<00:06:21.140> would<00:06:21.350> say<00:06:21.560> all<00:06:21.950> these<00:06:22.280> other

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 
so I would say all these other

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.450 
so I would say all these other
deceptions<00:06:23.420> that<00:06:23.570> I<00:06:23.750> have<00:06:23.990> mentioned<00:06:24.530> it's

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
deceptions that I have mentioned it's
