00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 warning in this top 5 pokémons 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.750
 most overrated from the first 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.179
 pokemon generation possibly 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.059
 we will find strong pokémons and how 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.429
 you have on your team so if you are 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.920
 a quarrel or you get offended by this guy 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.439
 of things I recommend you leave 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.310
 this video right now said and this 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.590
 let's start at number 5 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.840
 put to arcana in the dog pokemon 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.300
 fire one of the fire pokemons more 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.120
 great of all generations is 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.070
 pretty strong clear but you would say that 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.390
 the fans of this pokemon have done that 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.309
 be overrated 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.070
 it 's okay to want this can 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.129
 It was also my favorite one time but 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.489
 with so many fanboys of this pokemon already 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.260
 I like it and that's why nothing is on the top 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.690
 more than say post 5 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.600
 in position number 4 we will find 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.609
 boot the ghost pokemon that only gets 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.129
 manages to evolve by means of 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:02.559
 exchange the truth nor the fans should 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.229
 know that your attack and defense are not so 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.270
 high while you can learn attacks 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.940
 good of which the ball stands out 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.880
 shadow does not compensate for the rest bad that 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.550
 has this pokemon nothing more to say is 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.880
 remains with the position number 4 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.650
 in position 3 the pokemon is piled 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.510
 water dragon snake 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.240
 I think we already knew that pomegranates 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.130
 would be in this top many consider it 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.530
 of the strongest pokemon of all 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.410
 although with a simple impact on or with 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.960
 luck you could end it clear if you 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:38.290
 you find on your level are not bad either 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.420
 Pokemon is strong and defensive although it 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.520
 it happens the same as arcana or what 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.700
 overvalue and only this is why 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.759
 with this place on the top nothing more 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.729
 in position number 2 this pikachu the 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.950
 electric yellow rat good to say 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.799
 that this pokemon I like but not 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.259
 in the teams but in the anime and you send 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.240
 his role in these is more than the 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.700
 of lass which makes me a 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.549
 exaggeration on the part of pokemon but 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.039
 what is going to be done, even if it's good 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.019
 I'm leaving the subject is in 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.209
 this post for simply being a 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.940
 trash as soon as your statistics 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.430
 everything is bad in attack and defense not 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.980
 have enough health points in order 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.380
 I the only times I catch pikachu 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.329
 I was only following her evolve the 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.240
 which it is much better than him as 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:32.150
 everything and also learn better attacks 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:35.150
 placed number one in position 1 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.400
 find charizar blast and veins or las 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.000
 final evolutions of the initials of 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.220
 good song what else to say of the pokemon 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.680
 most overrated at present 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.960
 fanboys prefer these pokemon for being 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.420
 the only ones except talk in 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.310
 have me the evolution at the beginning this 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.650
 reason does not seem like something that really 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.050
 affect the decision of this top but 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.240
 Believe me, the fame of these rose 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.030
 more than I was with the game anymore 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.130
 recent pokemon pokemon x and pokemon and 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.350
 In case they prefer them because they are 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.350
 first and most brilliant initials and with 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.660
 its mega evolution even more worth mentioning 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.940
 what data 3par is the most 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.460
 It stands out for having two mega evolutions 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.620
 different for each delivery which I 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.540
 it makes me think because they did not mega 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.270
 evolutions for blast today continue to 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.190
 short for each delivery the only thing 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.950
 do they prefer to char? 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.090
 that the other two but I think that 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.160
 this has been all 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.120
 I hope the video was of his 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.860
 liking 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.909
 his friend profile has been spoken and that 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.909
 Have a good day
