openly passionate about the subject

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.520 
openly passionate about the subject
which<00:01:18.540> may<00:01:18.750> well<00:01:18.930> be<00:01:19.049> something<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.439> they've

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
which may well be something that they've

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.260 
which may well be something that they've
not<00:01:19.710> had<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.009> chance<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.460> be<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:20.729> open<00:01:20.880> about

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
not had the chance to be so open about

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.690 
not had the chance to be so open about
before<00:01:21.750> at<00:01:21.990> school<00:01:22.259> or<00:01:22.439> college<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:23.520> that's

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
before at school or college so that's

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.719 
before at school or college so that's
certainly<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.299> best<00:01:24.509> bit<00:01:24.750> for<00:01:24.900> me<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.729> I'm

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
certainly the best bit for me and I'm

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.219 
certainly the best bit for me and I'm
not<00:01:26.939> sure<00:01:27.090> there<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.330> worst<00:01:27.720> bit<00:01:28.110> but

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
not sure there is a worst bit but

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.330 
not sure there is a worst bit but
certainly<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.530> most<00:01:28.650> difficult<00:01:29.100> but<00:01:29.189> is

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
certainly the most difficult but is

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.510 
certainly the most difficult but is
making<00:01:29.520> those<00:01:29.759> final<00:01:30.180> decisions<00:01:30.680> about<00:01:31.680> who

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
making those final decisions about who

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.020 
making those final decisions about who
we<00:01:32.790> can<00:01:32.970> fit<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.450> because<00:01:34.439> there<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.710> always

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
we can fit in because there is always

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.609 
we can fit in because there is always
more<00:01:36.030> excellent<00:01:36.570> candidates<00:01:37.140> than<00:01:37.350> we've<00:01:37.470> got

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619

and<00:01:45.750> thinking<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.380> know<00:01:46.500> we<00:01:46.799> really<00:01:46.979> should

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
and thinking you know we really should

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.940 
and thinking you know we really should
be<00:01:47.369> taking<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.909> person<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.710> so<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.829> is

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
be taking that person and so it is

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.700 
be taking that person and so it is
fairly<00:01:50.189> all-consuming<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.470> think<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.560> most

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
fairly all-consuming I think the most

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.350 
fairly all-consuming I think the most
important<00:01:53.189> thing<00:01:53.340> for<00:01:53.460> candidates<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.240> other

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
important thing for candidates and other

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.389 
important thing for candidates and other
people<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.930> know<00:01:55.110> about<00:01:55.140> all<00:01:55.649> those<00:01:55.799> tutors<00:01:56.250> in

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
people to know about all those tutors in

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.580 
people to know about all those tutors in
the<00:01:56.460> processes<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.119> were<00:01:57.329> human<00:01:57.659> there's<00:01:58.530> a

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
the processes that were human there's a

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.230 
the processes that were human there's a
slight<00:01:58.860> sense<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.430> we<00:01:59.520> get<00:01:59.700> wheeled<00:01:59.939> out<00:02:00.090> of

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
slight sense that we get wheeled out of

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.940 
slight sense that we get wheeled out of
the<00:02:00.360> closet<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.960> do<00:02:01.110> interviews<00:02:01.619> as<00:02:01.829> there

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
the closet to do interviews as there

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.160 
the closet to do interviews as there
were<00:02:02.040> pre-programmed<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.909> do<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.570> then

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
were pre-programmed to do it and then

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.889 
were pre-programmed to do it and then
were<00:02:04.320> switched<00:02:04.560> off<00:02:04.740> afterwards<00:02:05.130> but<00:02:06.119> we<00:02:06.390> we

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
were switched off afterwards but we we

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.800 
were switched off afterwards but we we
really<00:02:07.110> enjoy<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.920> we<00:02:08.099> love<00:02:08.729> meeting<00:02:09.479> people

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
we're really in curious in that risk

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.790 
we're really in curious in that risk
we're<00:02:13.470> curious<00:02:13.650> about<00:02:13.950> people<00:02:14.660> and<00:02:15.660> we<00:02:16.349> enjoy

we're curious about people and we enjoy

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.720 
we're curious about people and we enjoy
exploring<00:02:17.750> new<00:02:18.750> people's<00:02:19.140> minds<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:20.370> when<00:02:20.700> I

exploring new people's minds and when I

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.400 
exploring new people's minds and when I
arrived<00:02:21.209> at<00:02:21.360> my<00:02:21.450> undergraduate<00:02:21.810> college<00:02:22.260> for

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
arrived at my undergraduate college for

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.050 
arrived at my undergraduate college for
interview<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:23.310> first<00:02:23.520> thing<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:23.700> did<00:02:23.760> was<00:02:23.910> get

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
interview the first thing I did was get

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.770 
interview the first thing I did was get
lost

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
lost

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.320 
lost
couldn't<00:02:25.349> find<00:02:25.500> my<00:02:25.620> own<00:02:25.830> room<00:02:26.130> nobody<00:02:26.940> there

couldn't find my own room nobody there

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.020 
couldn't find my own room nobody there
to<00:02:27.360> guide<00:02:27.750> me<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:28.230> do<00:02:28.380> so<00:02:28.709> and<00:02:29.040> I<00:02:29.580> thought<00:02:29.819> well

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
to guide me to do so and I thought well

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.430 
to guide me to do so and I thought well
this<00:02:30.180> is<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:30.450> if<00:02:30.569> I<00:02:30.630> can't<00:02:30.810> even<00:02:30.930> find<00:02:31.140> my<00:02:31.230> own

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
this is it if I can't even find my own

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.870 
this is it if I can't even find my own
room<00:02:31.709> how<00:02:31.980> on<00:02:32.100> earth<00:02:32.190> am<00:02:32.430> I<00:02:32.489> going<00:02:32.520> to<00:02:32.730> get

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
room how on earth am I going to get

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.059 
room how on earth am I going to get
through<00:02:33.090> an<00:02:33.209> actual<00:02:33.360> interview<00:02:33.810> here<00:02:34.170> but<00:02:34.950> I

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
through an actual interview here but I

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.500 
through an actual interview here but I
think<00:02:35.280> I<00:02:35.580> do<00:02:35.640> remember<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.209> feeling<00:02:36.330> of

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
think I do remember the feeling of

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.000 
think I do remember the feeling of
strangeness<00:02:36.810> about<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:37.620> interview<00:02:37.980> process

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
strangeness about the interview process

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.250 
strangeness about the interview process
and<00:02:38.610> that's<00:02:38.760> something<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.450> we<00:02:40.019> can't

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
and that's something that we can't

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.440 
and that's something that we can't
completely<00:02:40.680> eradicate<00:02:41.340> we<00:02:42.090> want<00:02:42.239> to<00:02:42.330> make

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
completely eradicate we want to make

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.640 
completely eradicate we want to make
candidates<00:02:42.780> feel<00:02:42.930> as<00:02:43.019> comfortable<00:02:43.530> as

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
candidates feel as comfortable as

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.759 
candidates feel as comfortable as
possible<00:02:43.709> but<00:02:44.459> it<00:02:44.610> is<00:02:44.640> strange<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.900> in<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.620> way

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
possible but it is strange and in a way

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.740 
possible but it is strange and in a way
the<00:02:47.190> candidates<00:02:47.550> have<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.790> be<00:02:47.910> ready<00:02:48.120> for<00:02:48.450> that

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
the candidates have to be ready for that

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.500 
the candidates have to be ready for that
but<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.050> is<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.170> very<00:02:49.410> different<00:02:49.680> experience

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
but it is a very different experience

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.020 
but it is a very different experience
we're<00:02:51.510> looking<00:02:51.959> for<00:02:52.340> different<00:02:53.340> qualities<00:02:53.850> in

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
we're looking for different qualities in

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.479 
we're looking for different qualities in
their<00:02:54.330> their<00:02:55.080> intellects<00:02:55.709> than<00:02:56.010> those<00:02:56.310> that

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
their their intellects than those that

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:57.979 
their their intellects than those that
have<00:02:56.549> been<00:02:56.760> developed<00:02:57.150> thus<00:02:57.330> far<00:02:57.569> in<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.840> work

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
have been developed thus far in the work

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.270 
have been developed thus far in the work
they've<00:02:58.170> been<00:02:58.200> doing<00:02:58.500> at<00:02:58.709> school<00:02:58.950> or<00:02:59.100> college

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
they've been doing at school or college

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.120 
they've been doing at school or college
and<00:03:00.239> so<00:03:00.660> it<00:03:00.780> has<00:03:00.930> a<00:03:00.959> strangeness<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.799> it<00:03:01.920> but<00:03:02.040> we

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
and so it has a strangeness to it but we

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.309 
and so it has a strangeness to it but we
try<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.340> make<00:03:02.580> that<00:03:02.730> as<00:03:02.910> as<00:03:03.299> positive<00:03:04.110> if<00:03:04.200> you

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
try to make that as as positive if you

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.800 
try to make that as as positive if you
like<00:03:04.470> as<00:03:04.650> possible<00:03:05.100> and<00:03:05.340> up<00:03:06.239> till<00:03:06.569> this<00:03:06.720> point

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
like as possible and up till this point

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.660 
like as possible and up till this point
it's<00:03:07.260> been<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.590> easy<00:03:07.769> part<00:03:08.100> of<00:03:08.220> things<00:03:08.400> really

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
it's been the easy part of things really

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.670 
it's been the easy part of things really
and<00:03:09.060> because<00:03:09.840> we've<00:03:10.049> had<00:03:10.230> pieces<00:03:10.500> of

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
and because we've had pieces of

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.440 
and because we've had pieces of
information<00:03:11.190> we've<00:03:11.489> been<00:03:11.700> processing<00:03:12.269> them

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
information we've been processing them

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.509 
information we've been processing them
but<00:03:12.959> obviously<00:03:13.350> we've<00:03:13.500> had<00:03:13.530> full<00:03:13.950> term<00:03:14.190> going

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
but obviously we've had full term going

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.630 
but obviously we've had full term going
on<00:03:14.610> alongside<00:03:14.880> so<00:03:15.540> we've<00:03:15.690> been<00:03:15.810> teaching<00:03:16.350> and

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
on alongside so we've been teaching and

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.080 
on alongside so we've been teaching and
coordinating<00:03:17.640> what<00:03:17.730> we've<00:03:17.820> been<00:03:17.880> doing

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
coordinating what we've been doing

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.789 
coordinating what we've been doing
alongside<00:03:18.329> teaching<00:03:19.079> so<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.350> workload

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
alongside teaching so the workload

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.789 
alongside teaching so the workload
hasn't<00:03:20.220> been<00:03:20.400> overwhelming<00:03:21.180> but<00:03:22.049> there<00:03:22.350> comes

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
hasn't been overwhelming but there comes

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.250 
hasn't been overwhelming but there comes
a<00:03:23.010> point<00:03:23.040> just<00:03:23.850> after<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.630> end<00:03:24.750> of<00:03:24.810> term<00:03:25.049> where

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
a point just after the end of term where

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.750 
a point just after the end of term where
you<00:03:25.350> basically<00:03:25.560> surrender<00:03:26.220> everything<00:03:26.579> else

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
you basically surrender everything else
