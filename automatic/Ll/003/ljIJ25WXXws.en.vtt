the far side of the dent and we go in
and<00:01:56.250> we<00:01:56.310> manipulate<00:01:57.240> with<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.990> tools<00:01:58.259> and

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
and we manipulate with the tools and

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.340 
and we manipulate with the tools and
we'll<00:01:58.950> bring<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.670> dent<00:01:59.909> out<00:02:00.299> just<00:02:00.960> work<00:02:01.170> it

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
we'll bring the dent out just work it

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
dent out from the inside well let's go

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:47.470 
dent out from the inside well let's go
ahead<00:02:40.070> and<00:02:40.250> get<00:02:40.310> her<00:02:40.430> started<00:02:46.209> so<00:02:47.209> what<00:02:47.360> we

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
ahead and get her started so what we

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.240 
ahead and get her started so what we
have<00:02:47.600> to<00:02:47.750> do<00:02:47.900> is<00:02:48.050> we<00:02:48.170> have<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:48.320> go<00:02:48.560> in<00:02:48.770> and<00:02:49.040> and

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
have to do is we have to go in and and

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.600 
have to do is we have to go in and and
and<00:02:49.760> locate<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.660> tip<00:02:50.840> of<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.020> tool<00:02:51.610> once

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
and locate the tip of the tool once

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.390 
and locate the tip of the tool once
we've<00:02:52.820> located<00:02:53.239> the<00:02:53.480> tip<00:02:53.660> of<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.870> tool

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
we've located the tip of the tool

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.130 
we've located the tip of the tool
generally<00:02:55.400> start<00:02:55.670> on<00:02:55.820> the<00:02:55.910> outer<00:02:56.360> edge<00:02:56.780> of<00:02:57.019> the

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
generally start on the outer edge of the

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.580 
generally start on the outer edge of the
dent<00:02:57.410> because<00:02:57.800> it's<00:02:58.100> easier<00:02:58.430> to<00:02:58.580> see<00:02:58.790> it<00:02:58.910> and

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
dent because it's easier to see it and

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.250 
dent because it's easier to see it and
then<00:03:00.590> we<00:03:00.910> slowly<00:03:01.910> start<00:03:02.600> to<00:03:02.720> work<00:03:02.870> our<00:03:03.080> way

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
then we slowly start to work our way

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.390 
then we slowly start to work our way
into<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.800> the<00:03:04.310> depth<00:03:04.580> of<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:04.850> dent<00:03:06.250> now<00:03:07.250> that

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
into the the depth of the dent now that

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.910 
into the the depth of the dent now that
whole<00:03:07.550> panel<00:03:07.970> is<00:03:08.060> moving<00:03:08.420> I<00:03:08.510> can<00:03:08.690> see<00:03:08.900> it<00:03:09.019> but

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
whole panel is moving I can see it but

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.380 
whole panel is moving I can see it but
you<00:03:09.980> can<00:03:10.250> achieve<00:03:10.310> with<00:03:10.670> that<00:03:10.820> light<00:03:11.060> just

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
you can achieve with that light just

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.150 
you can achieve with that light just
exactly<00:03:11.690> what<00:03:11.959> you're<00:03:12.110> doing<00:03:12.200> I<00:03:12.530> can<00:03:12.950> see

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
exactly what you're doing I can see

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.130 
exactly what you're doing I can see
exactly<00:03:13.310> where<00:03:14.030> I<00:03:14.090> met<00:03:14.360> with<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:14.750> tip<00:03:14.959> of<00:03:14.989> the

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
exactly where I met with the tip of the

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.009 
exactly where I met with the tip of the
tool<00:03:15.350> which<00:03:15.650> is<00:03:15.830> the<00:03:16.040> critical<00:03:17.000> point<00:03:17.570> that

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
tool which is the critical point that

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.160 
tool which is the critical point that
allows<00:03:18.890> us<00:03:18.920> to<00:03:19.250> be<00:03:19.610> able<00:03:19.670> to<00:03:20.140> lift<00:03:21.140> this<00:03:21.410> din<00:03:21.739> up

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
allows us to be able to lift this din up

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.780 
allows us to be able to lift this din up
from<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.290> inside<00:03:24.739> out<00:03:24.769> what's<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.519> typical

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
from the inside out what's the typical

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.990 
from the inside out what's the typical
time<00:03:26.090> it<00:03:26.329> takes<00:03:26.540> to<00:03:26.630> do<00:03:26.780> a<00:03:26.810> dent<00:03:27.079> like<00:03:27.230> that<00:03:28.000> if

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
time it takes to do a dent like that if

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.810 
time it takes to do a dent like that if
you're<00:03:29.269> good<00:03:29.420> good<00:03:29.660> like<00:03:29.870> you<00:03:30.079> I<00:03:30.730> didn't<00:03:31.730> like

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
you're good good like you I didn't like

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.500 
you're good good like you I didn't like
