00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
bleep Edel okay and what makes you a

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.000 
bleep Edel okay and what makes you a
paddle<00:00:33.210> different<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:34.200> obviously<00:00:34.680> it's<00:00:34.860> got

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
paddle different is obviously it's got

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.250 
paddle different is obviously it's got
two<00:00:35.219> blades<00:00:35.489> instead<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.940> one<00:00:36.149> okay<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.170> this

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
two blades instead of one okay and this

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.810 
two blades instead of one okay and this
is<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.469> stand-up<00:00:37.860> paddleboard<00:00:38.340> paddle

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
is a stand-up paddleboard paddle

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.030 
is a stand-up paddleboard paddle
okay<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.450> most<00:00:39.600> data<00:00:39.960> paddleboard<00:00:40.530> paddles

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
okay so most data paddleboard paddles

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.740 
okay so most data paddleboard paddles
have<00:00:41.340> just<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.700> single<00:00:41.910> blade<00:00:42.239> that's<00:00:42.600> right

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
have just a single blade that's right

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.900 
have just a single blade that's right
and<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.930> secret<00:00:43.230> entity<00:00:43.860> group<00:00:44.040> on<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.250> top<00:00:44.460> and

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
and a secret entity group on the top and

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.610 
and a secret entity group on the top and
you<00:00:45.030> paddle<00:00:45.360> on<00:00:45.450> one<00:00:45.629> side<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.140> after<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.410> while

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
you paddle on one side and after a while

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.930 
you paddle on one side and after a while
if<00:00:46.829> it's<00:00:46.980> windy<00:00:47.219> whatever<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.730> need<00:00:47.850> to

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
if it's windy whatever you need to

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.880 
if it's windy whatever you need to
correct<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.750> end<00:00:48.899> up<00:00:48.989> switching<00:00:49.230> hands<00:00:49.649> and

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
correct the end up switching hands and

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.310 
correct the end up switching hands and
paddling<00:00:50.190> on<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.370> other<00:00:50.489> side<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.899> really

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
paddling on the other side and I really

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.049 
paddling on the other side and I really
wanted<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.829> love<00:00:53.010> stand-up<00:00:53.520> paddleboarding

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
wanted to love stand-up paddleboarding

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.970 
wanted to love stand-up paddleboarding
but<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.210> didn't<00:00:54.539> like<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.989> paddle<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.590> didn't

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
but I didn't like the paddle I didn't

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.099 
but I didn't like the paddle I didn't
like<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.190> switching<00:00:56.610> from<00:00:56.760> side<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.000> side<00:00:57.180> so

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
like the switching from side to side so

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.110 
like the switching from side to side so
I<00:00:58.140> developed<00:00:58.440> this<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.100> decided<00:00:59.550> you're

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
I developed this so you decided you're

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.360 
I developed this so you decided you're
gonna<00:01:00.469> company<00:01:01.469> it's<00:01:01.620> completely<00:01:02.039> different

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
gonna company it's completely different

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.460 
gonna company it's completely different
and<00:01:02.520> better<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.570> started<00:01:03.989> with<00:01:04.110> just<00:01:04.350> a

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
and better so I started with just a

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.500 
and better so I started with just a
double<00:01:04.799> bladed<00:01:05.010> paddle<00:01:05.489> but<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:05.970> learned<00:01:06.240> early

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
double bladed paddle but I learned early

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.710 
double bladed paddle but I learned early
on<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.799> just<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.939> didn't<00:01:09.299> work<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.479> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
on that it just it didn't work that the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.539 
on that it just it didn't work that the
ergonomics<00:01:10.320> weren't<00:01:10.619> there<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:11.070> needed<00:01:11.400> to

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
ergonomics weren't there I needed to

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.640 
ergonomics weren't there I needed to
come<00:01:11.700> up<00:01:11.729> with<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.060> rotating<00:01:12.600> grips<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.590> the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
come up with the rotating grips and the

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.830 
come up with the rotating grips and the
rotating<00:01:14.070> grips<00:01:14.369> make<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.270> functional

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
rotating grips make it functional

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.100 
rotating grips make it functional
beautiful<00:01:16.080> okay<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.920> end<00:01:17.159> up<00:01:17.280> having

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
beautiful okay so you end up having

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.649 
beautiful okay so you end up having
basically<00:01:19.110> at<00:01:19.290> egret<00:01:19.619> position<00:01:20.040> on<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> top

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
basically at egret position on the top

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.210 
basically at egret position on the top
all<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.689> time<00:01:22.080> okay<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.770> don't<00:01:22.920> just<00:01:22.979> wit

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
all the time okay so you don't just wit

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.969 
all the time okay so you don't just wit
from<00:01:23.369> side<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.610> side<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.780> end<00:01:25.020> up<00:01:25.170> paddling

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
from side to side so you end up paddling

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.490 
from side to side so you end up paddling
side<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.369> side<00:01:26.610> every<00:01:27.330> every<00:01:27.840> stroke<00:01:28.110> every

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
side to side every every stroke every

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.200 
side to side every every stroke every
other<00:01:28.619> stroke<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.610> you're<00:01:29.759> getting<00:01:30.000> more

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
other stroke so you're getting more

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.100 
other stroke so you're getting more
power<00:01:30.509> strokes

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
power strokes

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.020 
power strokes
there's<00:01:31.380> no<00:01:31.530> time<00:01:32.159> wasted<00:01:32.610> with<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.790> back

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
there's no time wasted with a back

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.880 
there's no time wasted with a back
stroke<00:01:33.329> more<00:01:34.020> power<00:01:34.259> strokes<00:01:34.619> per<00:01:34.860> minute

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
stroke more power strokes per minute

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.190 
stroke more power strokes per minute
you're<00:01:35.610> getting<00:01:35.729> symmetrical<00:01:36.420> thrust<00:01:36.780> so

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
you're getting symmetrical thrust so

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.260 
you're getting symmetrical thrust so
you're<00:01:37.350> going<00:01:37.560> straighter<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.340> you're<00:01:39.060> going

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
you're going straighter and you're going

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.660 
you're going straighter and you're going
faster<00:01:39.689> okay<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.560> acts<00:01:40.860> as<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.070> balancing

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
faster okay and this acts as a balancing

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.429 
faster okay and this acts as a balancing
pole<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.479> end<00:01:42.630> up<00:01:42.659> with<00:01:42.840> better<00:01:42.960> balance

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
pole so you end up with better balance

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.530 
pole so you end up with better balance
you're<00:01:43.619> going<00:01:43.770> faster<00:01:44.220> straighter<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.909> yeah

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
you're going faster straighter and yeah

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
you're going faster straighter and yeah
better<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.869> came<00:01:46.020> up<00:01:46.140> with<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.350> all<00:01:46.530> by

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
better you came up with this all by

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.539 
better you came up with this all by
yourself

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
yourself

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.969

okay so this has been in the works for a
while<00:01:51.540> they've<00:01:51.840> been<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.079> works<00:01:52.229> for<00:01:52.290> a

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
while they've been in the works for a

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.890 
while they've been in the works for a
while<00:01:52.590> now<00:01:53.159> independent<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:54.119> me

during this other people have had
similar<00:01:57.000> ideas<00:01:57.060> okay<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.380> went<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.920> patent

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
similar ideas okay so I went to patent

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.040 
similar ideas okay so I went to patent

building<00:02:12.600> vo<00:02:12.840> booth<00:02:13.140> all<00:02:13.650> right<00:02:13.830> I've<00:02:14.280> also

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
building vo booth all right I've also

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.700 
building vo booth all right I've also
seen<00:02:14.820> just<00:02:15.570> out<00:02:15.660> of<00:02:15.690> reach<00:02:15.930> here<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:16.380> have<00:02:16.560> an

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
seen just out of reach here you have an

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.180 
seen just out of reach here you have an
adapter<00:02:17.220> for<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:18.240> regular<00:02:18.930> cochlear<00:02:19.680> hyukoh

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
adapter for a regular cochlear hyukoh

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.790 
adapter for a regular cochlear hyukoh
that's<00:02:20.370> correct<00:02:20.610> this<00:02:21.270> is<00:02:21.600> what<00:02:22.410> we<00:02:22.470> call<00:02:22.680> the

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
that's correct this is what we call the

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.610 
that's correct this is what we call the
bolt<00:02:23.010> on<00:02:23.190> grip<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:23.940> it<00:02:24.270> functions<00:02:24.870> similarly

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
bolt on grip and it functions similarly

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.550 
bolt on grip and it functions similarly
in<00:02:25.860> that<00:02:26.070> it<00:02:26.220> does<00:02:26.460> give<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.780> range

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
in that it does give you the the range

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.800 
in that it does give you the the range
of<00:02:28.740> motion<00:02:29.160> that<00:02:29.700> this<00:02:29.850> gives<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.270> right<00:02:30.630> but

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
of motion that this gives you right but

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.840 
of motion that this gives you right but
this<00:02:30.900> is<00:02:30.960> set<00:02:31.260> up<00:02:31.350> Isaac<00:02:31.770> so<00:02:32.160> as<00:02:32.280> a<00:02:32.640> I

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
this is set up Isaac so as a I

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.700 
this is set up Isaac so as a I
don't<00:02:33.030> know<00:02:33.210> because<00:02:33.690> if<00:02:33.930> your<00:02:34.080> hold<00:02:34.440> this<00:02:34.530> for

don't know because if your hold this for

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.080 
don't know because if your hold this for
a<00:02:34.740> second<00:02:35.010> sure<00:02:35.160> you<00:02:35.430> can<00:02:35.550> imagine<00:02:35.730> if<00:02:36.000> you're
