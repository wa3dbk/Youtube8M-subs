let's<00:00:03.030> take<00:00:03.150> a<00:00:03.179> look<00:00:03.330> at<00:00:03.449> the<00:00:03.570> asus<00:00:03.960> nvidia<00:00:04.410> gtx

00:00:04.719 --> 00:00:04.729 
let's take a look at the asus nvidia gtx

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:08.810 
let's take a look at the asus nvidia gtx

reference<00:00:09.120> card<00:00:09.300> this<00:00:09.420> one<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:09.720> smaller<00:00:10.139> than

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:10.379 
reference card this one is smaller than

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:13.039 
reference card this one is smaller than
the<00:00:10.500> standard<00:00:10.709> gtx<00:00:11.339> 760<00:00:11.820> which<00:00:12.120> is<00:00:12.269> nice<00:00:12.480> the

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
the standard gtx 760 which is nice the

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.319 
the standard gtx 760 which is nice the
the<00:00:13.799> heatsink<00:00:14.219> actually<00:00:14.519> extends<00:00:14.969> off<00:00:15.150> the

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:15.329 
the heatsink actually extends off the

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:16.700 
the heatsink actually extends off the
back<00:00:15.480> because<00:00:15.660> they<00:00:15.870> wanted<00:00:16.080> more<00:00:16.260> fin<00:00:16.530> so

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
back because they wanted more fin so

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.220 
back because they wanted more fin so
that<00:00:16.830> they<00:00:17.010> could<00:00:17.190> overclock<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:17.700> and<00:00:18.060> this<00:00:19.050> is

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
that they could overclock it and this is

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.020 
that they could overclock it and this is
one<00:00:19.380> hell<00:00:19.530> of<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.680> little<00:00:19.890> card<00:00:20.130> they've<00:00:20.460> used<00:00:20.940> a

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:21.030 
one hell of a little card they've used a

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.520 
one hell of a little card they've used a
lot<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.300> really<00:00:21.420> high<00:00:21.570> quality<00:00:21.630> components<00:00:22.440> so

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:22.530 
lot of really high quality components so

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:23.810 
lot of really high quality components so
let's<00:00:22.710> talk<00:00:22.830> about<00:00:22.980> what<00:00:23.220> makes<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.610> little

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
let's talk about what makes it a little

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.130 
let's talk about what makes it a little
different<00:00:24.090> than<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.270> other<00:00:24.390> seven<00:00:24.690> 60's<00:00:25.020> out

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
different than the other seven 60's out

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.680 
different than the other seven 60's out
there<00:00:25.320> on<00:00:25.620> the<00:00:26.070> market<00:00:26.460> shall<00:00:26.730> we<00:00:26.940> and<00:00:27.150> then

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:27.690 
there on the market shall we and then

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.000 
there on the market shall we and then
we're<00:00:27.840> also<00:00:27.930> gonna<00:00:28.110> do<00:00:28.260> some<00:00:28.290> benchmarks<00:00:28.890> but

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
we're also gonna do some benchmarks but

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.350 
we're also gonna do some benchmarks but
the<00:00:29.070> benchmarks<00:00:29.460> are<00:00:29.520> gonna<00:00:29.670> be<00:00:29.790> in<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.970> second

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:30.360 
the benchmarks are gonna be in a second

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.370 
the benchmarks are gonna be in a second
video<00:00:30.540> we're<00:00:30.810> just<00:00:30.840> going<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:31.140> talk<00:00:31.230> about

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
video we're just going to talk about

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.440 
video we're just going to talk about
what<00:00:31.920> makes<00:00:32.070> this<00:00:32.189> one<00:00:32.399> different<00:00:32.430> first<00:00:33.239> off

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
what makes this one different first off

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.069 
what makes this one different first off
the<00:00:33.989> specs<00:00:34.320> on<00:00:34.499> the<00:00:34.620> 760<00:00:35.570> it's<00:00:36.570> PCI<00:00:36.870> Express

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
cores the base clock is 1006 megahertz

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.099

and it does feature GPU boost 3.0 so

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.729 
and it does feature GPU boost 3.0 so
you'll<00:00:54.629> notice<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:54.989> sometimes<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.620> goes

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
you'll notice that sometimes it goes

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.430 
you'll notice that sometimes it goes
even<00:00:56.039> higher<00:00:56.069> than<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:57.239> essentially<00:00:57.659> you

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
even higher than that it essentially you

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.779 
even higher than that it essentially you
know<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.559> graphics<00:00:58.979> card<00:00:59.159> essentially<00:00:59.550> looks

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
know the graphics card essentially looks

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.219 
know the graphics card essentially looks
and<00:00:59.940> says<00:01:00.059> oh<00:01:00.179> I<00:01:00.239> can<00:01:00.539> do<00:01:00.659> a<00:01:00.690> little<00:01:00.809> better<00:01:01.019> and

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:01.229 
and says oh I can do a little better and

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:03.290 
and says oh I can do a little better and
not<00:01:01.319> overheat<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:01.949> it'll<00:01:02.219> it'll<00:01:02.850> bounce<00:01:03.059> up

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
not overheat so it'll it'll bounce up

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.310 
not overheat so it'll it'll bounce up
and<00:01:03.389> down<00:01:03.479> and<00:01:03.719> then<00:01:03.839> when<00:01:03.929> you're<00:01:04.050> in<00:01:04.140> Windows

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
and down and then when you're in Windows

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.990 
and down and then when you're in Windows
it'll<00:01:04.710> down<00:01:04.920> clock<00:01:05.220> itself<00:01:05.550> so<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.909> it

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
it'll down clock itself so that it

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.490 
it'll down clock itself so that it
doesn't<00:01:06.240> suck<00:01:06.450> up<00:01:06.570> all<00:01:06.689> kinds<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.020> power<00:01:07.200> and

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
doesn't suck up all kinds of power and

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.590 
doesn't suck up all kinds of power and
get<00:01:07.619> hot<00:01:07.829> and<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.820> memory<00:01:09.030> interface<00:01:09.329> on<00:01:09.479> this

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
get hot and the memory interface on this

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.940 
get hot and the memory interface on this
is<00:01:09.719> 256<00:01:10.680> bit<00:01:10.950> now<00:01:11.579> the<00:01:11.640> GTX<00:01:12.600> 760<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.560> very

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
is 256 bit now the GTX 760 is very

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.429 
is 256 bit now the GTX 760 is very
similar<00:01:14.460> in<00:01:14.790> performance<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.780> kind<00:01:16.170> of

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
similar in performance and it kind of

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.179 
similar in performance and it kind of
beats<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:17.009> in<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.310> few<00:01:17.520> areas<00:01:17.729> at<00:01:18.210> 1080p<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.680> it's

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
beats it in a few areas at 1080p so it's

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.130 
beats it in a few areas at 1080p so it's
also<00:01:20.340> more<00:01:20.549> expensive<00:01:20.610> cards<00:01:21.119> at<00:01:21.210> 670<00:01:21.659> okay

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
also more expensive cards at 670 okay

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.980 
also more expensive cards at 670 okay

I<00:01:52.890> will<00:01:53.310> say<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:54.030> better<00:01:54.570> designed

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990

power<00:02:11.580> much<00:02:11.909> like<00:02:12.120> we<00:02:12.269> talked<00:02:12.480> about<00:02:12.569> with<00:02:12.780> the

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
power much like we talked about with the

power much like we talked about with the
GTX<00:02:13.550> 780<00:02:14.550> there's<00:02:14.849> not<00:02:14.970> quite<00:02:15.120> as<00:02:15.180> many<00:02:15.390> phases

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
GTX 780 there's not quite as many phases

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:16.000 
GTX 780 there's not quite as many phases
of

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
of

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
of
we're<00:02:16.159> going<00:02:16.400> on<00:02:16.489> this<00:02:16.580> one<00:02:16.730> but<00:02:16.849> you<00:02:16.879> don't

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
we're going on this one but you don't

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.089 
we're going on this one but you don't
need<00:02:17.180> that<00:02:17.239> many<00:02:17.480> faces<00:02:17.870> we<00:02:18.200> have<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.409> 5k<00:02:18.590> caps

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
need that many faces we have the 5k caps

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.880 
need that many faces we have the 5k caps
we<00:02:19.370> have<00:02:19.550> the<00:02:19.730> you<00:02:20.120> know<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.360> better

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
we have the you know the better

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.160 
we have the you know the better
chokes<00:02:22.370> that<00:02:23.000> are<00:02:23.150> solid<00:02:23.480> they're<00:02:23.750> not<00:02:23.870> Hollow

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
chokes that are solid they're not Hollow

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.470 
chokes that are solid they're not Hollow
and<00:02:24.440> we<00:02:24.890> also<00:02:25.159> have<00:02:25.610> MOSFETs<00:02:26.209> that<00:02:26.390> are

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
and we also have MOSFETs that are

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.330 
and we also have MOSFETs that are
smaller<00:02:27.019> and<00:02:27.349> they<00:02:27.709> can<00:02:27.860> handle<00:02:28.129> more<00:02:28.280> power

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
smaller and they can handle more power

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.880 
smaller and they can handle more power
but<00:02:28.819> they<00:02:28.940> produce<00:02:29.150> less<00:02:29.840> heat<00:02:29.900> so<00:02:30.500> that's<00:02:30.680> all

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
but they produce less heat so that's all

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.559 
but they produce less heat so that's all
nice<00:02:31.099> we've<00:02:31.310> got<00:02:31.459> a<00:02:31.489> nice<00:02:31.670> heatsink<00:02:32.180> on<00:02:32.239> top<00:02:32.450> of

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
nice we've got a nice heatsink on top of

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.270 
nice we've got a nice heatsink on top of
that<00:02:32.660> it's<00:02:33.230> also<00:02:33.349> a<00:02:33.470> very<00:02:33.590> easy<00:02:33.709> card<00:02:34.069> to<00:02:34.160> take

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
that it's also a very easy card to take

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.890 
that it's also a very easy card to take
apart<00:02:34.610> if<00:02:34.849> you<00:02:34.970> wanted<00:02:35.209> to<00:02:35.299> take<00:02:35.390> it<00:02:35.510> apart<00:02:35.750> and

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
apart if you wanted to take it apart and

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.240 
apart if you wanted to take it apart and
play<00:02:36.080> around<00:02:36.200> with<00:02:36.379> it<00:02:36.470> I'm<00:02:36.709> not<00:02:36.739> sure<00:02:36.980> why<00:02:37.190> you

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
play around with it I'm not sure why you

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.320 
play around with it I'm not sure why you
would<00:02:37.340> do<00:02:37.489> that<00:02:37.580> it<00:02:37.700> would<00:02:37.790> probably<00:02:38.030> the

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
would do that it would probably the

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.229 
would do that it would probably the
warranty<00:02:38.720> but<00:02:38.989> yeah<00:02:39.709> now<00:02:40.250> there's<00:02:40.940> a<00:02:41.000> lot<00:02:41.150> of

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
warranty but yeah now there's a lot of

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:42.880 
warranty but yeah now there's a lot of
power<00:02:41.420> going<00:02:41.629> to<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:41.840> GPU<00:02:42.260> in<00:02:42.410> this<00:02:42.530> one<00:02:42.709> and

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
power going to the GPU in this one and

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.949 
power going to the GPU in this one and
it's<00:02:43.010> a<00:02:43.099> smaller<00:02:43.430> card<00:02:43.849> so<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.209> PCB<00:02:44.629> is<00:02:44.780> going

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
it's a smaller card so the PCB is going

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.780 
it's a smaller card so the PCB is going
to<00:02:45.019> get<00:02:45.140> really<00:02:45.379> hot<00:02:45.409> here's<00:02:46.370> what<00:02:46.489> they<00:02:46.579> did

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
to get really hot here's what they did

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.309 
to get really hot here's what they did
to<00:02:46.940> combat<00:02:47.269> that<00:02:47.480> with<00:02:47.659> this<00:02:47.840> graphics<00:02:48.260> card

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
to combat that with this graphics card

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:49.930 
to combat that with this graphics card
in<00:02:48.530> particular<00:02:48.769> on<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.430> back<00:02:49.700> you'll<00:02:49.879> see

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
in particular on the back you'll see

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.270 
in particular on the back you'll see
there's<00:02:50.269> a<00:02:50.510> small<00:02:51.349> plate<00:02:51.829> here<00:02:52.010> that<00:02:52.160> says

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
there's a small plate here that says

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.880 
there's a small plate here that says
direct<00:02:52.640> power<00:02:52.849> and<00:02:53.180> it's<00:02:53.989> a<00:02:54.170> separate<00:02:54.590> you

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
direct power and it's a separate you

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.259 
direct power and it's a separate you
know<00:02:54.950> piece<00:02:55.340> like<00:02:55.609> an<00:02:55.730> additional<00:02:56.090> little

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
know piece like an additional little

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.300 
know piece like an additional little
piece<00:02:56.480> there<00:02:56.690> that<00:02:56.900> routes<00:02:57.470> power<00:02:57.829> directly

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
piece there that routes power directly

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.360 
piece there that routes power directly
to<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:58.970> GPU<00:02:59.540> and<00:03:00.230> it<00:03:00.349> keeps<00:03:00.590> that<00:03:00.799> all<00:03:01.220> that

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
to the GPU and it keeps that all that

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.009 
to the GPU and it keeps that all that
current<00:03:01.790> that's<00:03:02.209> going<00:03:02.420> through<00:03:02.480> there<00:03:02.780> off

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
current that's going through there off

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.860 
current that's going through there off
of<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.650> PCB<00:03:04.250> keeping<00:03:05.060> the<00:03:05.180> entire<00:03:05.480> thing

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
of the PCB keeping the entire thing

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.270 
of the PCB keeping the entire thing
cooler<00:03:06.109> it's<00:03:06.349> actually<00:03:06.620> really<00:03:06.920> smart<00:03:07.160> I

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
cooler it's actually really smart I

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.530 
cooler it's actually really smart I
haven't<00:03:07.459> seen<00:03:07.579> something<00:03:07.849> like<00:03:07.879> this<00:03:08.209> in

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
haven't seen something like this in

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.009 
haven't seen something like this in
quite<00:03:09.170> a<00:03:09.290> while<00:03:09.620> on<00:03:09.650> on<00:03:10.099> a<00:03:10.129> GPU<00:03:10.720> but<00:03:11.720> it's<00:03:11.840> it's

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
quite a while on on a GPU but it's it's

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.940 
quite a while on on a GPU but it's it's
raised<00:03:12.440> off<00:03:12.799> of<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:13.609> the<00:03:14.000> PCB<00:03:14.829> direct<00:03:15.829> power

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
raised off of the the PCB direct power

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.369 
raised off of the the PCB direct power
y'all<00:03:16.420> so<00:03:17.420> that's<00:03:17.750> really<00:03:17.870> what<00:03:18.079> makes<00:03:18.260> this

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:18.379 
y'all so that's really what makes this

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:19.630 
y'all so that's really what makes this
one<00:03:18.560> a<00:03:18.590> little<00:03:18.709> bit<00:03:18.829> different<00:03:19.250> than<00:03:19.400> some<00:03:19.549> of

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
one a little bit different than some of

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.789 
one a little bit different than some of
the<00:03:19.700> other<00:03:19.849> gtx<00:03:20.359> 760<00:03:20.690> cards<00:03:21.139> out<00:03:21.290> there<00:03:21.319> this

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
the other gtx 760 cards out there this

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.440 
the other gtx 760 cards out there this
will<00:03:21.919> also<00:03:22.190> fit<00:03:22.370> into<00:03:22.459> a<00:03:22.519> smaller<00:03:22.819> form<00:03:23.120> factor

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
will also fit into a smaller form factor

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.210 
will also fit into a smaller form factor
case<00:03:23.660> than<00:03:23.870> a<00:03:23.930> lot<00:03:24.079> of<00:03:24.109> the<00:03:24.230> seven<00:03:24.709> 60's<00:03:25.069> out

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
case than a lot of the seven 60's out

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.250 
case than a lot of the seven 60's out
there<00:03:25.430> so<00:03:25.669> it's<00:03:26.329> a<00:03:26.389> hell<00:03:26.510> of<00:03:26.540> a<00:03:26.660> card<00:03:26.900> it's<00:03:27.079> nice

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
there so it's a hell of a card it's nice

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.420 
there so it's a hell of a card it's nice
and<00:03:27.470> fast<00:03:27.709> if<00:03:27.859> you<00:03:27.919> guys<00:03:28.040> want<00:03:28.190> to<00:03:28.250> see<00:03:28.310> how
