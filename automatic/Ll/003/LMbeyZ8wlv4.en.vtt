00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.510 
tweaked the trevenant and the Rotom I
think<00:00:44.280> we<00:00:44.399> tweak<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.510> excadrill<00:00:46.110> as<00:00:46.379> well<00:00:46.559> to

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.060 
think we tweak the excadrill as well to
have<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.960> mold<00:00:48.960> breaker<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.410> think<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:49.860> can't

go for the hydro pump and go ahead and

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.730 
go for the hydro pump and go ahead and
take<00:01:14.549> out<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:14.820> gliscor<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.540> have<00:01:15.720> no<00:01:16.140> clue<00:01:16.380> why

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
take out this gliscor I have no clue why

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.800 
take out this gliscor I have no clue why
they<00:01:17.430> even<00:01:17.700> went<00:01:17.939> for<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.180> earthquake<00:01:18.600> right

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
they even went for the earthquake right

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.870 
they even went for the earthquake right
there<00:01:18.990> considering<00:01:19.290> Rotom<00:01:19.770> has<00:01:19.890> levitate<00:01:20.520> but

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
there considering Rotom has levitate but

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.820 
there considering Rotom has levitate but
you<00:01:21.330> know<00:01:21.479> whatever<00:01:22.080> maybe<00:01:22.470> there<00:01:22.650> was<00:01:22.740> on

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
you know whatever maybe there was on

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.770 
you know whatever maybe there was on
some<00:01:23.009> next<00:01:23.189> level<00:01:23.460> prediction<00:01:24.180> or<00:01:24.299> some

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
some next level prediction or some

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.380 
some next level prediction or some
I<00:01:24.930> have<00:01:25.229> no<00:01:25.500> clue<00:01:25.740> but<00:01:26.430> I'm<00:01:26.640> gonna<00:01:26.820> go<00:01:27.060> into

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
I have no clue but I'm gonna go into

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.020 
I have no clue but I'm gonna go into
excadrill<00:01:27.810> now<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.380> just<00:01:28.470> go<00:01:28.680> ahead<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.030> take

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
excadrill now and just go ahead and take

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.429 
excadrill now and just go ahead and take
out<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.390> goodra<00:01:30.840> with<00:01:31.049> two<00:01:31.200> earthquakes

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
out this goodra with two earthquakes

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.249 
out this goodra with two earthquakes
because<00:01:32.100> goodra<00:01:32.970> can't<00:01:33.329> really<00:01:33.840> take

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
because goodra can't really take

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.920 
because goodra can't really take
earthquakes<00:01:35.070> at<00:01:35.340> all<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.820> then<00:01:36.270> if<00:01:36.479> they<00:01:36.659> send

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
earthquakes at all and then if they send

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.060 
earthquakes at all and then if they send
in<00:01:37.049> something<00:01:37.350> else<00:01:37.560> something<00:01:37.710> else<00:01:37.920> is

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
in something else something else is

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.200 
in something else something else is
gonna<00:01:38.159> take<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.430> lot<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.790> damage<00:01:39.030> from

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
gonna take a lot of damage from

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.120 
gonna take a lot of damage from
earthquake<00:01:39.689> from<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.079> excadrill<00:01:40.470> his<00:01:40.799> extra

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
earthquake from the excadrill his extra

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.160 
earthquake from the excadrill his extra
great<00:01:41.250> excadrill<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:42.090> just<00:01:42.270> really<00:01:42.630> powerful

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
great excadrill is just really powerful

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.109 
great excadrill is just really powerful
but<00:01:43.860> I'm<00:01:44.189> gonna<00:01:44.369> go<00:01:44.520> ahead<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.700> go<00:01:44.820> back<00:01:45.090> into

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
weird play in my eyes because why would

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.470 
weird play in my eyes because why would
you<00:03:32.390> go<00:03:32.540> for<00:03:32.750> a<00:03:32.810> close<00:03:33.050> combat<00:03:33.380> on<00:03:33.950> a<00:03:34.640> trevenant

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
you go for a close combat on a trevenant

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.170 
you go for a close combat on a trevenant
you<00:03:36.350> know<00:03:36.500> like<00:03:36.739> I<00:03:37.010> mean<00:03:37.610> obviously<00:03:37.970> I<00:03:38.030> was

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
you know like I mean obviously I was

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.699 
you know like I mean obviously I was
gonna<00:03:38.269> switch<00:03:38.480> out<00:03:38.630> though<00:03:38.840> I<00:03:38.989> mean<00:03:39.170> you<00:03:39.560> know

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
gonna switch out though I mean you know

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.590 
gonna switch out though I mean you know
I<00:03:39.920> guess<00:03:40.130> you<00:03:40.340> know<00:03:40.489> they<00:03:40.970> was<00:03:41.120> on<00:03:41.209> that<00:03:41.330> next

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
I guess you know they was on that next

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.539 
I guess you know they was on that next
level<00:03:41.810> prediction<00:03:42.739> and<00:03:42.950> they<00:03:43.070> predicted

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
level prediction and they predicted

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.160 
level prediction and they predicted
me<00:03:43.610> to<00:03:43.700> switch<00:03:43.910> because<00:03:44.120> why<00:03:44.600> would<00:03:44.810> I<00:03:44.840> stay

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
me to switch because why would I stay

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.020 
me to switch because why would I stay
while<00:03:45.590> I<00:03:45.769> keeping<00:03:46.130> or<00:03:46.220> trevenant<00:03:46.580> on<00:03:46.730> a<00:03:46.760> star

anyway let's talk about what's actually
on<00:03:56.239> the<00:03:56.510> screen<00:03:56.810> diggersby<00:03:57.320> and<00:03:57.769> cloister

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
on the screen diggersby and cloister

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.370 
on the screen diggersby and cloister
diggersby<00:03:59.209> goes<00:03:59.450> for<00:03:59.600> the<00:03:59.660> hammer<00:03:59.870> arm<00:04:00.110> takes

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
diggersby goes for the hammer arm takes

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.140 
diggersby goes for the hammer arm takes
the<00:04:00.500> closest<00:04:00.799> down<00:04:00.920> to<00:04:01.100> the<00:04:01.190> sash<00:04:01.489> the

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
the closest down to the sash the

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.759 
the closest down to the sash the
cloister<00:04:02.510> went<00:04:02.690> for<00:04:02.780> the<00:04:02.840> shell<00:04:03.049> smash<00:04:03.260> and<00:04:03.560> I

cloister went for the shell smash and I

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:05.199 
cloister went for the shell smash and I
sharp<00:04:04.100> but<00:04:04.280> diggers<00:04:04.549> he<00:04:04.640> was<00:04:04.760> able<00:04:04.880> to<00:04:05.000> live

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
sharp but diggers he was able to live

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.479 
sharp but diggers he was able to live
and<00:04:05.480> take<00:04:05.930> out<00:04:06.049> the<00:04:06.080> cloister<00:04:06.560> but<00:04:07.400> now
