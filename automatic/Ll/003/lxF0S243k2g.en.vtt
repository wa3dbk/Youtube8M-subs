00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.810
 work with the diner called mega 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.630
 snacks here on the vaccine 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.430
 I was not happy with the clientele. 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.750
 we worked a sandwiches sandwiches 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.720
 juices and açaí 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.540
 but there is a strong middle to the sandwich and saw 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:45.290
 in community pacification a chance 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.660
 to grow apart and present the 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:51.559
 story result 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.610
 André's recipe worked with the 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.920
 hot dog 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.790
 as I knew that until the pacification in 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.190
 community 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.430
 I saw a need to suddenly have 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.329
 that you leave the street rafael vaz and me 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.880
 retire 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.979
 Okay, so there was a little shop in front 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.899
 to the hot dog tent and stayed 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.810
 waiting to see what will happen until 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:13.130
 that the movement is beauty is not equal but 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.780
 I had no experience for a 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.880
 diner worked well with the dog 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.950
 hot in the beginning who worked was a 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.880
 non-member museum we had no employee 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.470
 that our store has a meter for 3 a 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.570
 promotion more or less of this 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.460
 just put a bike inside the store 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.930
 You do not go in then we start to 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.119
 develop techniques 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.580
 We put a little roller around the store. 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.049
 included in the sink and then we started 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.420
 To play is to move here and there. 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.100
 changing the plate on the left another 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.549
 day plate on the right and got to do 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.070
 a pile of a paul a tiny vat 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.560
 I got changed more or less more 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.650
 eight times to the place shop until you reach the 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.770
 Today's stowage 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.980
 We have a small thank god store. 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.080
 best located having a good part 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.960
 Rocinha's right in the middle of trade 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.120
 understood then it is not interesting to 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.970
 I changed the place oil when the 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.590
 people began to realize that the water 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.000
 I was getting no longer working 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.320
 we were no longer aware of the 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.030
 number of customers 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.040
 we had to start thinking 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.620
 a way of being able to do twice as much 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.540
 What do we do in less time? 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.830
 I worked and everything had good will but 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.810
 We did not know how to do it the right way. 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.910
 and we got around a lot to be able to 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.770
 get a sebrae result I did not see in the 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.570
 in the community has the sebrae not make a 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.760
 fieldwork here with this 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.350
 Sebrae rating came to the 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.450
 community began to serve the 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.220
 with the arrival of sebrae 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.810
 we get to know new things and 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.430
 you fall in love with the idea of 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.870
 improve your store I started to stay 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.160
 addicted in progress it seems sebrae 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.140
 I started to attend some other 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.330
 to know how they 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.880
 work and understand everything I have a 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.440
 a preparation room where I have 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.110
 three people work all day 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.420
 to be able to produce for that time 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.830
 the movement has lost and I still 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.780
 meet the staff on delivery 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.180
 domicile and motorcycle exits to take the 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.860
 merchandise and people attending to everyone 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.290
 who is in the store the staff is in the store 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.360
 and there's no way people are not in the 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.190
 sidewalks understood why will close the 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.830
 store-side trade and I go 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.390
 opening the sidewalk benches on the 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.880
 crowded time we can put 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.489
 four people inside work and more 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.989
 two from the outside and there was a 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.430
 a watershed that was when people 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.890
 started working with facebook 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.590
 because then the store popularized so I 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.680
 I tell you today that we are 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.570
 can sell more the brand than 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.540
 properly sandwich we do 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.790
 postings of satire linked to 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.950
 today with a lot of humor makes the 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.320
 customer first if the grid of what is 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.360
 seeing and then he remembers that behind 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.850
 there is a mark of a 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.390
 snack bar 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.280
 so mega x today I think it's a 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.240
 of the most popular stores within 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.360
 community 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.620
 the truth in the pole in the big diner 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.690
 We are preparing for fame. 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.020
 soon to franchise the brand and power 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.870
 spread this brand into communities 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.070
 pacified people and we see them as 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.750
 things are working 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.630
 we get more breath to try 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:19.050
 to improve more and more this is another 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.780
 happy ending with real entrepreneurs 

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:24.350
 an inspiring story that would 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.350
 movie
