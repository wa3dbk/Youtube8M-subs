but<00:02:54.490> when<00:02:54.610> you<00:02:54.670> slow<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.060> video<00:02:55.270> down<00:02:55.480> news<00:02:56.490> I

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
but when you slow the video down news I

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.520 
but when you slow the video down news I
look<00:02:57.790> like<00:02:57.970> a<00:02:58.300> homemade<00:02:58.810> perm<00:02:59.140> like<00:02:59.410> you

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
look like a homemade perm like you

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.170 
look like a homemade perm like you
deserved<00:02:59.830> in<00:03:00.010> your<00:03:00.130> backyard<00:03:00.310> shooting<00:03:01.030> and

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
deserved in your backyard shooting and

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.290 
deserved in your backyard shooting and
blinking<00:03:01.510> I<00:03:01.630> thought<00:03:01.840> that<00:03:02.020> was<00:03:02.140> really<00:03:02.320> cool

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.120 

the<00:03:07.300> proof<00:03:07.540> of<00:03:07.690> it<00:03:07.810> will<00:03:07.960> come<00:03:07.990> in<00:03:08.290> we<00:03:08.470> get<00:03:08.890> into

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
the proof of it will come in we get into

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.360 
the proof of it will come in we get into
editing<00:03:09.640> and<00:03:09.820> pull<00:03:10.210> everything<00:03:10.660> together<00:03:11.370> put

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
editing and pull everything together put

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.100 
editing and pull everything together put
it<00:03:12.400> to<00:03:12.610> a<00:03:12.640> track<00:03:13.030> and<00:03:13.480> see<00:03:13.750> that<00:03:13.930> this

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
it to a track and see that this

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.870 
it to a track and see that this
literally<00:03:14.590> is<00:03:14.950> going<00:03:15.160> to<00:03:15.220> put<00:03:15.400> people<00:03:15.760> into

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
literally is going to put people into

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.260 
literally is going to put people into
the<00:03:16.060> world<00:03:16.270> of<00:03:16.570> Smith<00:03:17.380> &amp;<00:03:17.560> Wesson<00:03:17.860> M&amp;P

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.300 

I<00:03:21.360> think<00:03:22.020> it's<00:03:22.170> gonna<00:03:22.350> allow<00:03:22.800> them<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.160> be

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
I think it's gonna allow them to be

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.670 
I think it's gonna allow them to be
reconsidered<00:03:24.000> by<00:03:24.300> an<00:03:24.420> entire<00:03:24.810> new<00:03:25.170> audience

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
reconsidered by an entire new audience

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.540 
reconsidered by an entire new audience
and<00:03:26.520> then<00:03:26.610> I<00:03:26.640> believe<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.210> style<00:03:27.540> of<00:03:27.870> filming

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
and then I believe the style of filming

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.040 
and then I believe the style of filming
along<00:03:29.550> with<00:03:29.880> the<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.330> music<00:03:30.750> that<00:03:30.900> we're

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
along with the the music that we're

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.400 
along with the the music that we're
considering

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
considering

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.710 
considering
the<00:03:33.160> action<00:03:33.700> that<00:03:33.820> we're<00:03:33.970> capturing<00:03:34.210> should

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
the action that we're capturing should

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.860 
the action that we're capturing should
help<00:03:34.930> attract<00:03:35.320> all<00:03:35.560> of<00:03:35.710> them
