going to discuss the different types of
LED<00:00:07.870> video<00:00:08.139> lights<00:00:08.530> that<00:00:08.800> we<00:00:08.920> have<00:00:09.099> available

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
LED video lights that we have available

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.789 
LED video lights that we have available
first<00:00:10.780> thing<00:00:10.959> you<00:00:11.019> want<00:00:11.169> to<00:00:11.230> notice<00:00:11.469> is<00:00:11.650> we

first thing you want to notice is we

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:15.029 
first thing you want to notice is we
have<00:00:11.919> our<00:00:12.959> 2500<00:00:13.959> five<00:00:14.200> and<00:00:14.530> five<00:00:14.650> zero<00:00:14.950> zero

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:15.039 
have our 2500 five and five zero zero

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:16.890 
have our 2500 five and five zero zero
one<00:00:15.459> these<00:00:16.030> two<00:00:16.240> are<00:00:16.270> going<00:00:16.420> to<00:00:16.480> be<00:00:16.539> the<00:00:16.690> most

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900 
one these two are going to be the most

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.580 
one these two are going to be the most
powerful<00:00:17.320> lights<00:00:17.830> they<00:00:18.490> are<00:00:18.730> run<00:00:18.970> off<00:00:19.210> of

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
powerful lights they are run off of

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.800 
powerful lights they are run off of
video<00:00:20.590> batteries<00:00:21.369> and<00:00:22.090> they<00:00:22.179> do<00:00:22.240> also<00:00:22.509> come

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
video batteries and they do also come

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.589 
video batteries and they do also come
with<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:24.369> charger<00:00:24.400> so<00:00:24.939> you're<00:00:25.089> able<00:00:25.240> to<00:00:25.420> plug

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:25.599 
with the charger so you're able to plug

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:27.240 
with the charger so you're able to plug
it<00:00:25.720> right<00:00:25.750> into<00:00:26.050> the<00:00:26.170> wall<00:00:26.380> and<00:00:26.589> recharge<00:00:27.039> it

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
it right into the wall and recharge it

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.390 
it right into the wall and recharge it
now<00:00:28.150> 5005<00:00:29.109> is<00:00:29.589> going<00:00:29.859> to<00:00:29.919> be<00:00:29.980> a<00:00:30.009> little<00:00:30.279> bit

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
now 5005 is going to be a little bit

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.380 
now 5005 is going to be a little bit
more<00:00:30.519> powerful<00:00:30.999> connections<00:00:31.480> for<00:00:31.900> LED<00:00:32.770> lights

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
more powerful connections for LED lights

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.970 
more powerful connections for LED lights
500<00:00:34.390> one<00:00:34.570> only<00:00:34.809> has<00:00:34.930> three<00:00:35.260> LED<00:00:35.620> lights<00:00:35.829> and

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
500 one only has three LED lights and

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.430 
500 one only has three LED lights and
it's<00:00:36.399> slightly<00:00:36.670> less<00:00:36.969> powerful<00:00:37.329> both<00:00:38.140> of<00:00:38.320> them

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
it's slightly less powerful both of them

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.250 
it's slightly less powerful both of them
do<00:00:38.530> you<00:00:38.620> come<00:00:38.890> with<00:00:39.579> barn<00:00:39.850> doors<00:00:40.180> and<00:00:40.570> gels

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
do you come with barn doors and gels

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.779 
do you come with barn doors and gels
attached<00:00:41.649> so<00:00:42.219> that<00:00:42.340> you<00:00:42.460> can<00:00:42.640> create

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:42.789 
attached so that you can create

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:45.029 
attached so that you can create
different<00:00:42.940> effects<00:00:43.480> when<00:00:43.750> using<00:00:44.050> it<00:00:44.199> now<00:00:44.410> to

00:00:45.029 --> 00:00:45.039 
different effects when using it now to

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:47.520 
different effects when using it now to
attach<00:00:45.430> a<00:00:45.550> battery<00:00:45.730> on<00:00:46.270> this<00:00:46.570> you<00:00:47.199> simply

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
attach a battery on this you simply

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:55.020 
attach a battery on this you simply
slide<00:00:47.739> it<00:00:48.070> on<00:00:52.350> there<00:00:53.350> you<00:00:53.410> go<00:00:53.440> slide<00:00:54.129> it<00:00:54.280> on<00:00:54.399> and

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
slide it on there you go slide it on and

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.939 
slide it on there you go slide it on and
then<00:00:55.059> turn<00:00:55.300> the<00:00:55.359> power<00:00:55.510> button<00:00:55.809> on<00:00:55.960> so<00:00:56.739> you<00:00:56.829> do

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
then turn the power button on so you do

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:58.619 
then turn the power button on so you do
get<00:00:57.070> a<00:00:57.129> nice<00:00:57.370> video<00:00:57.879> light<00:00:58.120> and<00:00:58.269> of<00:00:58.329> course<00:00:58.539> I

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
get a nice video light and of course I

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.540 
get a nice video light and of course I
can<00:00:58.780> said<00:00:58.930> you<00:00:59.050> can<00:00:59.170> use<00:00:59.320> a<00:00:59.350> barn<00:00:59.590> door<00:00:59.739> now

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
can said you can use a barn door now

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.939 
can said you can use a barn door now
after<00:01:01.359> you<00:01:01.449> turn<00:01:01.600> it<00:01:01.750> off<00:01:01.870> to<00:01:02.530> remove<00:01:02.800> the

I'm<00:01:21.250> next<00:01:21.579> video<00:01:21.970> lights<00:01:22.210> of<00:01:22.420> BL<00:01:22.780> 112<00:01:23.470> it's

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
I'm next video lights of BL 112 it's

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.840 
I'm next video lights of BL 112 it's
going<00:01:24.280> about<00:01:24.369> 70<00:01:25.079> it's<00:01:26.079> about<00:01:26.170> a<00:01:26.290> 70<00:01:26.650> power<00:01:26.890> now

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
going about 70 it's about a 70 power now

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.270 
going about 70 it's about a 70 power now
this<00:01:28.000> gets<00:01:28.270> really<00:01:28.509> great<00:01:28.900> it<00:01:29.799> attaches<00:01:30.100> right

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
set up your camera as you can see and it

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.700 
set up your camera as you can see and it
does<00:01:32.829> actually<00:01:33.040> take<00:01:33.549> double<00:01:34.180> a<00:01:34.299> batteries<00:01:34.930> so

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
does actually take double a batteries so

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.260 
does actually take double a batteries so
you'll<00:01:35.860> be<00:01:35.979> able<00:01:36.070> to<00:01:36.220> change<00:01:36.430> those<00:01:36.759> out<00:01:36.970> and

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
you'll be able to change those out and

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.490 
you'll be able to change those out and
if<00:01:37.329> you<00:01:37.420> do<00:01:37.540> ever<00:01:37.750> charge<00:01:37.990> will<00:01:38.200> double<00:01:38.439> a

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
if you do ever charge will double a

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.350 
if you do ever charge will double a
double<00:01:38.619> a<00:01:38.950> battery<00:01:38.979> you<00:01:39.729> can<00:01:39.880> use<00:01:40.000> those<00:01:40.180> as

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
double a battery you can use those as

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.950 
double a battery you can use those as
well<00:01:41.009> now<00:01:42.009> we're<00:01:42.159> last<00:01:42.460> two<00:01:42.759> video<00:01:43.720> lights

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
well now we're last two video lights

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.709 
well now we're last two video lights
actually<00:01:44.469> plug<00:01:44.860> into<00:01:45.189> the<00:01:45.399> wall<00:01:45.490> what<00:01:46.479> you<00:01:46.600> do

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
actually plug into the wall what you do

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.929 
actually plug into the wall what you do
is<00:01:46.840> you<00:01:46.930> go<00:01:47.079> ahead<00:01:47.259> and<00:01:47.530> plug<00:01:48.399> them<00:01:48.549> in<00:01:48.729> and
