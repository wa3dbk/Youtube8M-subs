is<00:05:51.260> that's<00:05:51.410> probably<00:05:51.500> gonna<00:05:51.740> get<00:05:51.860> us<00:05:51.950> again

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:52.040 
is that's probably gonna get us again

is that's probably gonna get us again
scratch<00:05:52.490> quite<00:05:52.880> quickly<00:05:53.240> it's<00:05:53.480> not<00:05:53.510> going<00:05:53.690> to

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
scratch quite quickly it's not going to

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.030 
scratch quite quickly it's not going to
take<00:05:53.870> long<00:05:53.900> but<00:05:54.260> I'll<00:05:54.410> imagine<00:05:54.590> you<00:05:54.830> probably

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.040 
take long but I'll imagine you probably

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:01.020 
take long but I'll imagine you probably
can<00:05:55.430> pick<00:05:56.180> up<00:05:56.330> other<00:05:56.480> backs<00:05:56.690> fairly<00:05:57.170> cheap
