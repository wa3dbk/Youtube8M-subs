hadn't done that I would have been in a

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:36.579 
hadn't done that I would have been in a
very<00:06:34.250> bad<00:06:34.969> position<00:06:35.300> of<00:06:35.719> owing<00:06:36.050> these<00:06:36.199> people

money with nope

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.320 
money with nope
or<00:06:37.960> no<00:06:38.920> way<00:06:39.070> of<00:06:39.220> getting<00:06:39.370> out<00:06:39.610> of<00:06:39.790> it<00:06:39.910> basically

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 
or no way of getting out of it basically

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.250 
or no way of getting out of it basically
so<00:06:40.720> my<00:06:41.440> what<00:06:42.070> it<00:06:42.160> boils<00:06:42.460> down<00:06:42.520> to<00:06:42.940> is<00:06:43.150> if<00:06:43.420> you're
