00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
the other end of the wire and then you

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.619 
the other end of the wire and then you
are<00:02:13.920> going<00:02:14.159> to<00:02:14.370> take<00:02:14.580> your<00:02:14.790> three<00:02:15.030> pearls<00:02:15.330> and

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
are going to take your three pearls and

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.770 
are going to take your three pearls and
you're<00:02:15.750> going<00:02:15.959> to<00:02:16.080> thread<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.799> pearls<00:02:17.129> into

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
you're going to thread the pearls into

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.720 
you're going to thread the pearls into
the<00:02:18.780> wire<00:02:19.019> and<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:20.249> should<00:02:20.489> look<00:02:20.669> something

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
the wire and it should look something

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:28.170 
the wire and it should look something
that<00:02:21.389> looks<00:02:21.629> like<00:02:21.779> this

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.460 

then<00:02:29.180> you<00:02:29.360> are<00:02:29.390> going<00:02:29.660> to<00:02:29.780> take<00:02:30.050> your<00:02:30.200> pearl

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
then you are going to take your pearl

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.990 
then you are going to take your pearl
and<00:02:30.709> you're<00:02:30.830> going<00:02:31.040> to<00:02:31.190> slide<00:02:31.459> it<00:02:31.670> all<00:02:31.819> the<00:02:31.849> way

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
and you're going to slide it all the way

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.240 
and you're going to slide it all the way
to<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.420> other<00:02:32.599> end<00:02:32.900> of<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.410> wire<00:02:33.440> and<00:02:34.099> then

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
to the other end of the wire and then

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.920 
to the other end of the wire and then
you<00:02:34.370> are<00:02:34.489> going<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.790> take<00:02:35.060> your<00:02:35.239> pearl<00:02:35.540> and

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
you are going to take your pearl and

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.259 
you are going to take your pearl and
then<00:02:36.050> you're<00:02:36.200> going<00:02:36.620> to<00:02:36.739> create<00:02:37.580> kind<00:02:37.910> of<00:02:38.060> like

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
then you're going to create kind of like

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.160 
then you're going to create kind of like
a<00:02:38.480> triangle<00:02:38.900> shape<00:02:39.260> that<00:02:39.799> looks<00:02:39.830> like<00:02:40.280> this

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
a triangle shape that looks like this

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.900 
a triangle shape that looks like this
after<00:02:42.170> making<00:02:42.379> the<00:02:42.620> pearl<00:02:42.890> into<00:02:43.370> a<00:02:43.400> triangle

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
after making the pearl into a triangle

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.699 
after making the pearl into a triangle
basically<00:02:44.660> what<00:02:44.840> we<00:02:44.959> are<00:02:45.080> going<00:02:45.260> to<00:02:45.379> do<00:02:45.590> is

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
basically what we are going to do is

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.070 
basically what we are going to do is
we're<00:02:45.890> going<00:02:46.099> to<00:02:46.190> take<00:02:46.519> the<00:02:46.849> wire<00:02:47.060> and<00:02:47.390> wrap<00:02:47.780> it

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
we're going to take the wire and wrap it

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.539 
we're going to take the wire and wrap it
around<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:48.860> three<00:02:49.459> pearls<00:02:50.950> so<00:02:51.950> this<00:02:52.310> how<00:02:52.489> it

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
around the three pearls so this how it

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.369 
around the three pearls so this how it
should<00:02:52.730> look<00:02:52.790> like<00:02:52.910> after<00:02:53.299> you<00:02:53.660> wrap<00:02:53.959> around

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
should look like after you wrap around

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.069 
should look like after you wrap around
the<00:02:54.590> wire<00:02:54.849> around<00:02:55.849> the<00:02:56.150> pearls<00:02:56.480> and<00:02:56.660> basically

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
the wire around the pearls and basically

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:59.589 
the wire around the pearls and basically
what<00:02:57.799> we<00:02:57.950> are<00:02:58.160> going<00:02:58.340> to<00:02:58.430> do<00:02:58.670> next<00:02:58.910> is<00:02:59.150> we<00:02:59.390> are

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
what we are going to do next is we are

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.030 
what we are going to do next is we are
going<00:02:59.840> to<00:03:00.049> secure<00:03:00.709> the<00:03:01.370> pearls<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:03.040> wires

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
going to secure the pearls and the wires

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.100 
going to secure the pearls and the wires
together<00:03:04.459> because<00:03:05.030> right<00:03:05.299> now<00:03:05.329> it<00:03:05.810> kind<00:03:06.049> of

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
together because right now it kind of

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.650 
together because right now it kind of
moves<00:03:06.319> around<00:03:06.860> and<00:03:07.220> basically<00:03:07.790> when<00:03:08.540> i'm

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
moves around and basically when i'm

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.030 
moves around and basically when i'm
going<00:03:08.750> to<00:03:08.810> show<00:03:08.989> you<00:03:09.019> right<00:03:09.260> now<00:03:09.319> it<00:03:09.709> kind<00:03:09.980> of

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
going to show you right now it kind of

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.460 
going to show you right now it kind of
that's<00:03:10.519> going<00:03:10.910> to<00:03:11.239> make<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:11.780> pearl<00:03:12.049> and<00:03:12.319> while

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
that's going to make the pearl and while

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.110 
that's going to make the pearl and while
I<00:03:12.500> secure<00:03:12.829> so<00:03:13.220> basically<00:03:13.579> we're<00:03:13.760> going<00:03:14.000> to

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
I secure so basically we're going to

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.000 
I secure so basically we're going to
take<00:03:14.299> that<00:03:14.480> wire<00:03:14.720> and<00:03:15.049> then<00:03:15.440> there<00:03:15.650> is<00:03:15.799> like

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
take that wire and then there is like

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.150 
take that wire and then there is like
this<00:03:16.040> small<00:03:16.579> little<00:03:17.360> hole<00:03:17.870> that<00:03:18.709> you<00:03:18.739> could

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
this small little hole that you could

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.819 
this small little hole that you could
slip<00:03:19.519> that<00:03:19.700> wire<00:03:20.000> into<00:03:20.780> where<00:03:21.079> the<00:03:21.110> pearl<00:03:21.530> is

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
slip that wire into where the pearl is

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.069 
slip that wire into where the pearl is
and<00:03:22.250> then<00:03:22.640> basically<00:03:22.910> we're<00:03:23.329> going<00:03:23.660> to<00:03:23.780> wrap

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
and then basically we're going to wrap

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.690 
and then basically we're going to wrap
it<00:03:24.110> around<00:03:24.610> the<00:03:25.610> UM<00:03:26.739> the<00:03:27.739> wire<00:03:27.980> that<00:03:28.340> we<00:03:28.489> made

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
it around the UM the wire that we made

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.210 
it around the UM the wire that we made
around<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.329> pearl<00:03:29.630> and<00:03:30.049> we're<00:03:30.709> going<00:03:30.980> to<00:03:31.010> do

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
around the pearl and we're going to do

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.099 
around the pearl and we're going to do
it<00:03:31.370> again<00:03:31.430> and<00:03:31.819> basically<00:03:32.480> we're<00:03:32.720> going<00:03:32.959> to

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
it again and basically we're going to

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:35.440 
it again and basically we're going to
take<00:03:33.470> that<00:03:33.620> wire<00:03:33.859> and<00:03:34.190> then<00:03:34.639> we<00:03:34.790> are<00:03:35.000> going<00:03:35.030> to

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
take that wire and then we are going to

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.500 
take that wire and then we are going to
slit<00:03:35.870> it<00:03:35.989> into<00:03:36.470> that<00:03:37.190> little<00:03:37.400> hole<00:03:37.850> next<00:03:38.299> to

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
slit it into that little hole next to

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.360 
slit it into that little hole next to
the<00:03:38.660> pearl<00:03:38.989> and<00:03:39.319> then<00:03:39.530> we<00:03:39.650> are<00:03:39.680> going<00:03:39.799> to<00:03:40.130> wrap

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
the pearl and then we are going to wrap

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.170 
the pearl and then we are going to wrap
it<00:03:40.430> around<00:03:40.670> the<00:03:41.120> larger<00:03:41.870> um<00:03:42.639> wire<00:03:43.639> that<00:03:43.970> is

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
it around the larger um wire that is

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.759 
it around the larger um wire that is
around<00:03:44.569> the<00:03:44.750> pearl<00:03:44.959> so<00:03:45.260> hopefully<00:03:45.590> all<00:03:45.620> of

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
around the pearl so hopefully all of

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.589 
around the pearl so hopefully all of
this<00:03:46.040> is<00:03:46.190> making<00:03:46.310> sense<00:03:46.549> and<00:03:46.970> hopefully<00:03:47.209> this

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
this is making sense and hopefully this

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.170 
this is making sense and hopefully this
visual<00:03:47.989> is<00:03:48.260> working<00:03:48.709> out<00:03:48.889> I'm<00:03:49.459> really<00:03:49.819> sorry

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180

visual is working out I'm really sorry
if<00:03:50.510> I<00:03:51.290> don't<00:03:51.530> know<00:03:51.650> how<00:03:51.769> to<00:03:51.829> describe<00:03:52.010> this<00:03:52.519> and

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
if I don't know how to describe this and

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.589 
if I don't know how to describe this and

makes sense to you and hopefully this

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:18.820 
makes sense to you and hopefully this
vigil<00:03:58.940> is<00:03:59.209> working<00:03:59.599> out<00:03:59.750> for<00:03:59.959> you<00:04:00.049> guys
