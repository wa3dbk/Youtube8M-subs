00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.220
 within the infinite laws called 

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:07.500
 universal there is one that should be 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.330
 had understood the most important who 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.460
 the law of karma that has to see that 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.809
 there are three types of speech charge of 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.599
 the action and the thought 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.880
 you do something good you get something good 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.039
 in return and the opposite is a bad 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.430
 person wishes evil to others in 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.960
 some time karma is going to catch you 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.090
 everything bad is returned I think that 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.920
 we all agree if we go to the 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.029
 note and we commented on the importance of 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.029
 karma in our life 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.730
 karma if you wish someone bad 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.190
 returns is one of the theories or laws 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.649
 ancestral and metaphysical that has always 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.109
 been in doubt how much power can be 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.120
 of the energies that it has cause and 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:52.579
 effect with consequences to bad 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.010
 actions there is karma that so 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.469
 powerful can be everything you do 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.239
 has an effect on transit does it 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.100
 it's also a pain to have photos that you're not 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.420
 doing you imitates what you do to 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.339
 others do to you what you 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.500
 as he says fuck or if you take away the 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.690
 others you take it from yourself because one 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.399
 it is also the others in some way 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.080
 there is a connection to a web these 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:14.600
 money 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.450
 karma means action and refers to 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.160
 physical and mental verbal actions 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.060
 that can be used in a 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.610
 negative 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.330
 unleashing this ancestral law of cause and 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.670
 effect karma is ultimately the 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.080
 destination what you have to live in 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:35.010
 your life according to your performances and seconds 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.720
 behaviors 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.910
 so that he understands when we talk about 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.280
 karma more clearly suppose that 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.130
 your life is a planting field if you 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.680
 it hurts another person will have a bad 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.250
 harvest is done well will have good 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.180
 fruits 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.420
 carla is a law of cause and effect 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.670
 It is a law that aims to teach you 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.920
 teaching him a lesson is not a punishment and 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.110
 people who interpret it as punishment 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.900
 things that I have done have a 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.780
 consequence and I have to live it 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.610
 it is a law 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.039
 do you believe in these energies that 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.709
 popularly they are called the returns of 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.569
 life there will be karma and you have to 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.250
 be very careful, be very careful with 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.050
 the bad fibers the bad waves because 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.540
 is exactly what causes when one 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.090
 has a bad energy is this is that it 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.090
 return and all this has an effect 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.110
 bounce that in the end is not positive I 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.190
 I think the best thing is to wish good 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:34.459
 because that's how you do better if I believe that the 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.370
 work badly in life you pay in this 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.110
 life or in another life or you pay with your 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.380
 loved ones or you pay for it from some 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.090
 way not what you want not something bad that 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.959
 I have done if I have returned but to whom 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.210
 not because it's not about not believing a lot 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.190
 in those things 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.650
 be careful, lady, if you 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.220
 has ever done something wrong to another 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.900
 person 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.210
 this can be returned against you 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.160
 according to the law of karma you can drag 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.920
 these evils even to other lives 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.110
 where you pay attention to everything bad that you do in 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.720
 this life if it is not returned to you in this 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.890
 same life is returned to you in another life 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.890
 in another existence 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.220
 is the karma effect of action and 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.349
 consequence is what is commonly 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.930
 Talk about all the evil you do to him 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:23.390
 another person can be laughed at 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.230
 the saying that everything in this life in another 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.230
 it pays
