00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.290 
I became fascinated with the Mayans in
this<00:00:39.230> concept<00:00:39.589> of<00:00:39.680> this<00:00:39.829> race<00:00:40.460> of<00:00:40.760> people<00:00:40.910> that

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
this concept of this race of people that

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.029 
this concept of this race of people that
were<00:00:41.449> there<00:00:41.750> were<00:00:42.019> so<00:00:42.350> powerful<00:00:42.589> and<00:00:43.010> so

00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:43.039 
were there were so powerful and so

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:45.130 
were there were so powerful and so
organized<00:00:43.699> as<00:00:43.969> a<00:00:44.000> culture<00:00:44.420> that<00:00:44.870> they<00:00:45.079> were

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
organized as a culture that they were

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.099 
organized as a culture that they were
invading<00:00:46.039> all<00:00:46.309> the<00:00:46.550> outlying<00:00:46.850> areas<00:00:47.300> rounding

00:00:48.099 --> 00:00:48.109 
invading all the outlying areas rounding

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:50.560 
invading all the outlying areas rounding
up<00:00:48.230> all<00:00:48.379> the<00:00:48.589> people<00:00:48.920> dragging<00:00:49.730> back<00:00:50.059> to<00:00:50.269> their

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
up all the people dragging back to their

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.719 
up all the people dragging back to their
temples<00:00:51.079> and<00:00:51.290> sacrificing<00:00:52.100> to<00:00:52.250> their<00:00:52.489> gods

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:52.729 
temples and sacrificing to their gods

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:54.969 
temples and sacrificing to their gods
and<00:00:53.030> so<00:00:53.180> we<00:00:53.269> took<00:00:53.510> that<00:00:53.809> concept<00:00:54.140> and<00:00:54.649> put<00:00:54.890> it

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:54.979 
and so we took that concept and put it

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:58.389 
and so we took that concept and put it
into<00:00:55.100> a<00:00:55.190> fantasy<00:00:55.549> world<00:00:56.890> and<00:00:57.890> you<00:00:58.010> had<00:00:58.219> your
