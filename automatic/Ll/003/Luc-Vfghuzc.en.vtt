00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
I think it came as something of a shock

but discredited in the eyes of the world

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.100 
but discredited in the eyes of the world
and<00:00:10.980> if<00:00:11.400> that<00:00:11.550> institution<00:00:12.389> was<00:00:12.630> discredited

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
and if that institution was discredited

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.369 
and if that institution was discredited
in<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.590> eyes<00:00:13.710> of<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.190> world<00:00:15.109> then<00:00:16.109> the

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
in the eyes of the world then the

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.480 
in the eyes of the world then the
Confederacy<00:00:17.070> itself<00:00:18.560> would<00:00:19.560> be<00:00:19.740> discredited

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
in the eyes of history so it became a

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.179 
in the eyes of history so it became a
psychological<00:00:24.660> necessity<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:25.470> think<00:00:25.830> for<00:00:26.039> them

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
psychological necessity I think for them

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.660 
psychological necessity I think for them
to<00:00:26.250> deny<00:00:26.820> that<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.330> war<00:00:27.539> was<00:00:27.750> about<00:00:27.900> slavery

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
to deny that the war was about slavery

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.269 
to deny that the war was about slavery
that<00:00:29.670> they<00:00:29.910> were<00:00:29.970> fighting<00:00:30.480> for<00:00:30.510> the

preservation defense perpetuation of
that<00:00:36.600> institution<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.910> so<00:00:38.910> they<00:00:39.570> developed<00:00:40.140> a

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
that institution and so they developed a

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.510 
that institution and so they developed a
series<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.340> alternative<00:00:42.180> explanations<00:00:43.520> for
