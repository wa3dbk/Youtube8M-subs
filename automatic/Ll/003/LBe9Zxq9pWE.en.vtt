00:00:49.500 --> 00:01:04.339
 points have cleaned up like that includes the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:11.630
 tip 1 3 1 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:11.630
 we take them we have to put them right 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:22.620
 here they are well together 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.670
 and then you see that she is well 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:30.930
 set with tulle and pose pending 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:35.090
 so when I make flies I have ten 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:38.570
 or fifteen think like that but I'm preparing 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:43.550
 15-15 this thing 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:48.330
 say that in 12 then it's six dead 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:51.650
 now we do it for once I'm going 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:57.590
 fly with two sons a 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:02:02.250
 okay because to make the system 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:08.730
 that you find joly you have to do with 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:10.820
 two fine threads that this son with wax 

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.820
 bee 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:21.920
 firstly the feeling not read and in 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:24.290
 plus it takes less high 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.570
 it's as if you had it 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:34.470
 waterproofed finger the difference 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:39.840
 a movie a more mischievous we will do we will do 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:43.140
 the body with that and then tied the feathers 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.620
 with that one when we do a fly 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:50.370
 you must not start all 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:54.000
 near the ring you have to leave the 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:57.180
 room for the head because after when 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.370
 you have tasks or you do the circles case 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:04.739
 plus the place to do the nine finals 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:11.660
 you see it's free to you the little one 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:15.920
 space kiala there is a little long here 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.920
 the c2 mm 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.330
 that a little scrambled that when she is 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.330
 dried 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.890
 this is the duration 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:43.489
 to make peace after you come back there 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.750
 the same three will be removed after 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.819
 ok cut 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.900
 no i'm doing a side 1 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:33.060
 okay now to do the other side 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.560
 if I come 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.540
 but it's done on purpose because you're 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.540
 there I have the trac 1 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:05:05.220
 it's very difficult starts to 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:08.030
 to work there after you come back there 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.030
 back to the thousand 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:26.199
 there after you bring all that you block 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.199
 behind 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:59.020
 it's hard work and when you have a 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:06:04.950
 expert photographer there you did that 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:09.240
 it's over you do 3 laps 4 5 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:09.240
 as long as that support you can go 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.730
 after you points like that 

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:30.469
 act i stem the block 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.780
 this practically finished
