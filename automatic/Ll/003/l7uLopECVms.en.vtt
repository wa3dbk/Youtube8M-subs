00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.250 
applications that aren't steffi in the
background<00:00:26.119> so<00:00:27.119> now<00:00:27.330> let's<00:00:27.630> take<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.810> look<00:00:28.080> at

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
background so now let's take a look at

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.200 
background so now let's take a look at
the<00:00:28.619> reasons<00:00:29.039> why<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.369> shouldn't<00:00:29.760> solve<00:00:30.090> the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
the reasons why you shouldn't solve the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.770 
the reasons why you shouldn't solve the
app<00:00:30.330> on<00:00:30.480> your<00:00:30.599> phone<00:00:31.790> so<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.910> first<00:00:33.149> reason<00:00:33.420> is

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
app on your phone so the first reason is

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.110 
app on your phone so the first reason is
that<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:34.260> clears<00:00:34.469> up<00:00:34.680> unnecessary<00:00:35.399> data<00:00:35.730> and

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
that it clears up unnecessary data and

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.030 
that it clears up unnecessary data and
frees<00:00:36.360> up<00:00:36.510> storage<00:00:36.960> for<00:00:37.380> more<00:00:37.590> important

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
frees up storage for more important

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.860 
frees up storage for more important
things<00:00:38.070> if<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.879> have<00:00:39.059> ever<00:00:39.270> faced<00:00:39.629> low

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
things if you have ever faced low

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.240

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
feature will come in handy applications

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.229 
feature will come in handy applications
collect<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.920> lot<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.280> information<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:44.940> gets

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
phone's memory so let's just take a look

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.110 
phone's memory so let's just take a look
at<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.350> standard<00:00:49.770> clean<00:00:49.950> function<00:00:50.340> here<00:00:50.550> what

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
at the standard clean function here what

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.029 
at the standard clean function here what
it<00:00:51.239> does<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.449> basically<00:00:51.960> combines<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.649> list<00:00:52.890> of

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
it does is basically combines a list of

more number of files and again like the

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.679 
more number of files and again like the
previous<00:01:32.369> example<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:33.060> can<00:01:33.210> actually<00:01:33.360> choose

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
previous example you can actually choose

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.420 
previous example you can actually choose
whatever<00:01:34.020> files<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.650> want<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.040> clean<00:01:35.250> and

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
what you want to keep and the second

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.359 
what you want to keep and the second

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
reason is that it improves battery life

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.280 
reason is that it improves battery life
apps<00:01:41.970> running<00:01:42.210> in<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.509> background<00:01:42.630> they<00:01:43.140> eat

apps running in the background they eat
up<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.500> lot<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.799> RAM<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.250> as<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.490> result<00:01:44.759> they

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
up a lot of RAM and as a result they

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.149 
up a lot of RAM and as a result they
consume<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.420> lot<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.659> battery<00:01:45.840> life<00:01:46.079> as<00:01:46.290> well<00:01:46.590> so

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
consume a lot of battery life as well so

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.560 
consume a lot of battery life as well so
the<00:01:47.340> best<00:01:47.520> way<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.759> prevent<00:01:47.970> this<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.450> by

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
the best way to prevent this is by

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.690 
the best way to prevent this is by
closing<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.049> applications<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:50.009> aren't

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
closing the applications that aren't

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.670 
closing the applications that aren't
used<00:01:50.880> once<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.240> are<00:01:51.329> done<00:01:51.479> with<00:01:51.540> them<00:01:51.869> but<00:01:52.409> the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
used once you are done with them but the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.200 
used once you are done with them but the
issue<00:01:52.770> with<00:01:53.009> most<00:01:53.280> applications<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:54.030> that

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
issue with most applications is that

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.850 
issue with most applications is that
they<00:01:54.360> restart<00:01:54.810> automatically<00:01:55.380> once<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.770> have

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
they restart automatically once you have

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.770 
they restart automatically once you have
closed<00:01:56.070> them<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.520> the

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
closed them and the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.660 
closed them and the
continue<00:01:57.049> to<00:01:57.080> eat<00:01:57.350> a<00:01:57.380> Bram<00:01:57.710> and<00:01:57.890> drain<00:01:58.490> the

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
continue to eat a Bram and drain the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.510 
continue to eat a Bram and drain the
battery<00:01:58.940> life<00:01:59.090> so<00:01:59.630> what<00:01:59.840> this<00:02:00.320> app<00:02:00.740> has<00:02:00.799> is<00:02:01.490> a

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
battery life so what this app has is a

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.580 
battery life so what this app has is a
memory<00:02:01.820> boost<00:02:02.180> function<00:02:02.659> that<00:02:03.200> basically

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
memory boost function that basically

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.940 
memory boost function that basically
allows<00:02:03.770> you<00:02:04.159> to<00:02:04.520> delete<00:02:05.240> all<00:02:05.690> such<00:02:05.960> apps<00:02:06.170> so

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
allows you to delete all such apps so

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.980 
allows you to delete all such apps so
right<00:02:07.130> now<00:02:07.159> you<00:02:07.340> can<00:02:07.580> see<00:02:07.759> that<00:02:07.990> there's

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
right now you can see that there's

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.070 
right now you can see that there's
around<00:02:09.259> 659<00:02:09.830> mb<00:02:10.369> of<00:02:10.580> ram<00:02:11.030> being<00:02:11.510> consumed<00:02:11.930> by

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
around 659 mb of ram being consumed by

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.050 
around 659 mb of ram being consumed by
applications<00:02:12.740> that<00:02:12.980> are<00:02:13.010> running<00:02:13.130> so<00:02:13.880> all<00:02:14.000> i

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
applications that are running so all i

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.370

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
restarting it will restart if you

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.570 
restarting it will restart if you
actually<00:02:23.350> run<00:02:24.350> them<00:02:24.590> but<00:02:24.830> till<00:02:25.100> then<00:02:25.130> they

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
actually run them but till then they

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.130 
actually run them but till then they
won't<00:02:25.730> come<00:02:26.030> back<00:02:26.180> on<00:02:26.420> their<00:02:26.630> own<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:26.989> they

won't come back on their own and they

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.110 
won't come back on their own and they
won't<00:02:27.380> actually<00:02:27.560> eat<00:02:27.920> a<00:02:27.950> gram<00:02:28.280> or<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:28.820> battery

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
won't actually eat a gram or the battery

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.290 
won't actually eat a gram or the battery
life<00:02:30.130> you<00:02:31.130> can<00:02:31.280> even<00:02:31.400> choose<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:31.850> exclude<00:02:32.030> a

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
life you can even choose to exclude a

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.520 
life you can even choose to exclude a
few<00:02:32.450> of<00:02:32.540> them<00:02:32.660> from<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:32.870> list<00:02:33.140> so<00:02:33.320> right<00:02:33.500> now

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
few of them from the list so right now

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.710 
few of them from the list so right now
you<00:02:34.190> can<00:02:34.340> see<00:02:34.519> that<00:02:34.550> it<00:02:34.940> is<00:02:34.970> actually<00:02:35.239> freeing

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
you can see that it is actually freeing

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.560 
you can see that it is actually freeing
up<00:02:35.870> a<00:02:36.140> lot<00:02:37.100> of<00:02:37.130> memory<00:02:37.580> and<00:02:37.610> like<00:02:38.209> we<00:02:38.420> saw

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
up a lot of memory and like we saw

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.530 
up a lot of memory and like we saw
earlier<00:02:38.989> it<00:02:39.290> has<00:02:39.530> freed<00:02:39.800> up<00:02:39.920> 600<00:02:40.430> 4.2<00:02:41.000> mb<00:02:41.330> and

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
earlier it has freed up 600 4.2 mb and

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.250 
earlier it has freed up 600 4.2 mb and
it<00:02:42.380> says<00:02:42.590> that<00:02:42.800> such<00:02:43.370> amount<00:02:44.120> of<00:02:44.239> and<00:02:44.420> memory

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
it says that such amount of and memory

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.660 
it says that such amount of and memory
has<00:02:45.470> been<00:02:45.500> boosted<00:02:47.830> the<00:02:48.830> third<00:02:49.010> point<00:02:49.280> is<00:02:49.459> that

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
has been boosted the third point is that

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.850 
has been boosted the third point is that
it<00:02:49.850> has<00:02:50.030> a<00:02:50.060> clean<00:02:50.269> and<00:02:50.569> simple<00:02:50.720> UI<00:02:51.110> that<00:02:51.650> does

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
the app looks quite good and it's quite

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.180 
the app looks quite good and it's quite

free to download the fourth point is

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.660 
free to download the fourth point is
that<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:30.170> app<00:03:30.320> has<00:03:30.350> a<00:03:30.680> home<00:03:31.040> screen<00:03:31.340> icon

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
that the app has a home screen icon

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.150 
that the app has a home screen icon
shortcut<00:03:32.180> and<00:03:32.420> floating<00:03:32.870> widget<00:03:33.230> as<00:03:33.380> well<00:03:33.560> so

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
shortcut and floating widget as well so

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.370 
shortcut and floating widget as well so
you<00:03:34.880> see<00:03:35.030> cleaner<00:03:35.269> basically<00:03:35.810> allows<00:03:36.049> you<00:03:36.260> to

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
you see cleaner basically allows you to

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.960 
you see cleaner basically allows you to
create<00:03:36.500> an<00:03:36.829> icon<00:03:37.220> that<00:03:37.250> you<00:03:37.489> can<00:03:37.609> place<00:03:37.790> on

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
create an icon that you can place on

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.940 
create an icon that you can place on
your<00:03:38.060> home<00:03:38.239> screen<00:03:38.269> for<00:03:39.230> example<00:03:39.590> I<00:03:39.650> have<00:03:39.680> two

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
your home screen for example I have two

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.920 
your home screen for example I have two
icons<00:03:40.340> of<00:03:40.519> that<00:03:40.700> here<00:03:40.910> I<00:03:41.120> mean<00:03:41.269> just<00:03:41.450> one<00:03:41.810> is

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
icons of that here I mean just one is

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.300 
icons of that here I mean just one is
need<00:03:42.079> a<00:03:42.109> better<00:03:42.350> this<00:03:42.739> two<00:03:42.890> on<00:03:43.040> the<00:03:43.160> home

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
need a better this two on the home

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.670 
need a better this two on the home
screen<00:03:43.430> so<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:44.329> icon<00:03:44.750> acts<00:03:44.959> as<00:03:45.109> a<00:03:45.140> shortcut<00:03:45.620> to

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
screen so the icon acts as a shortcut to

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.800 
screen so the icon acts as a shortcut to
free<00:03:45.950> up<00:03:46.070> RAM<00:03:46.280> by

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810

memory was freed up during the process

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:09.150 
memory was freed up during the process
there's<00:04:07.540> also<00:04:07.750> this<00:04:08.019> floating<00:04:08.380> icon<00:04:08.800> here<00:04:09.010> you

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
there's also this floating icon here you

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.030 
there's also this floating icon here you
can<00:04:09.310> see<00:04:09.430> that<00:04:09.459> there's<00:04:09.819> forty<00:04:10.150> three<00:04:10.269> percent

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
can see that there's forty three percent

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.410 
can see that there's forty three percent
of<00:04:12.040> ground<00:04:12.370> being<00:04:12.580> used<00:04:12.819> at<00:04:12.970> the<00:04:13.030> moment<00:04:13.390> so

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
of ground being used at the moment so

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.120 
of ground being used at the moment so
all<00:04:13.660> you<00:04:13.810> have<00:04:14.170> to<00:04:14.319> do<00:04:14.440> is<00:04:14.560> just<00:04:14.590> click<00:04:14.920> on<00:04:15.069> that

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
all you have to do is just click on that

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.099 
all you have to do is just click on that
and<00:04:15.459> it<00:04:15.670> does<00:04:15.880> the<00:04:16.000> same<00:04:16.030> thing<00:04:16.450> for<00:04:16.660> you<00:04:16.780> so<00:04:16.959> it

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
and it does the same thing for you so it

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.409 
and it does the same thing for you so it
moves<00:04:17.380> the<00:04:17.650> ramp<00:04:18.070> and<00:04:18.280> it's<00:04:18.820> optimized<00:04:19.299> and

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
moves the ramp and it's optimized and

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.150 
moves the ramp and it's optimized and
right<00:04:19.630> now<00:04:19.750> it<00:04:19.870> says<00:04:20.019> it's<00:04:20.440> already<00:04:20.799> optimized

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
right now it says it's already optimized

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.100 
right now it says it's already optimized
and<00:04:21.430> this<00:04:21.579> is<00:04:21.700> the<00:04:21.790> best<00:04:22.000> that<00:04:22.120> you<00:04:22.240> can<00:04:22.389> get<00:04:23.050> at

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
and this is the best that you can get at

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.860 
and this is the best that you can get at
the<00:04:23.350> current<00:04:23.590> moment<00:04:23.830> and<00:04:24.389> what<00:04:25.389> you<00:04:25.510> can<00:04:25.720> do

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
the current moment and what you can do

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.980 
the current moment and what you can do
is<00:04:26.020> basically<00:04:26.229> you<00:04:27.100> can<00:04:27.280> even<00:04:27.460> move<00:04:27.880> this<00:04:28.150> the

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
is basically you can even move this the

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.659 
is basically you can even move this the
floating<00:04:29.200> icon<00:04:29.530> you<00:04:29.650> can<00:04:29.680> move<00:04:29.950> it<00:04:30.130> to<00:04:30.160> the

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
floating icon you can move it to the

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.159 
floating icon you can move it to the
left<00:04:30.700> corner<00:04:31.120> the<00:04:31.389> right<00:04:31.540> corner<00:04:31.840> put<00:04:32.050> it

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
left corner the right corner put it

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.890 
left corner the right corner put it
anywhere<00:04:32.410> you<00:04:32.560> want<00:04:32.950> and<00:04:33.300> all<00:04:34.300> you<00:04:34.600> have<00:04:34.630> to<00:04:34.810> do

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
anywhere you want and all you have to do

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.420 
anywhere you want and all you have to do
is<00:04:35.020> this<00:04:35.200> give<00:04:35.919> a<00:04:35.950> single<00:04:36.160> tap<00:04:37.889> now<00:04:38.889> the<00:04:38.950> fifth

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
is this give a single tap now the fifth

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.070 
is this give a single tap now the fifth
and<00:04:39.639> last<00:04:39.760> point<00:04:40.090> is<00:04:40.270> that<00:04:40.479> the<00:04:40.630> application

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
and last point is that the application

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.770 
and last point is that the application
is<00:04:41.440> quite<00:04:42.010> lightweight<00:04:42.280> it's<00:04:42.760> small<00:04:43.300> in<00:04:43.600> size

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
is quite lightweight it's small in size

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.260 
is quite lightweight it's small in size
now<00:04:44.440> this<00:04:44.680> might<00:04:44.830> not<00:04:45.010> probably<00:04:45.430> sound<00:04:45.820> very

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
now this might not probably sound very

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.180 
now this might not probably sound very
important<00:04:46.810> to<00:04:46.930> you<00:04:47.020> but<00:04:47.169> it<00:04:47.320> actually<00:04:47.350> is<00:04:47.979> one

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
important to you but it actually is one

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.159 
important to you but it actually is one
of<00:04:48.280> the<00:04:48.340> most<00:04:48.580> important<00:04:49.090> aspects<00:04:49.600> of<00:04:49.750> you<00:04:49.990> see

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
of the most important aspects of you see

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.130 
of the most important aspects of you see
cleaner<00:04:50.530> and<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:52.270> reason<00:04:52.419> is<00:04:52.690> that<00:04:52.720> has<00:04:53.050> an

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.140 
cleaner and the reason is that has an

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.290 
cleaner and the reason is that has an
application<00:04:53.710> that<00:04:53.740> frees<00:04:54.039> up<00:04:54.250> RAM<00:04:54.490> storage<00:04:54.940> in

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
application that frees up RAM storage in

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.820 
application that frees up RAM storage in
order<00:04:55.479> to<00:04:55.600> make<00:04:55.780> the<00:04:55.900> user<00:04:56.080> experience<00:04:56.260> faster

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
order to make the user experience faster

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.890 
order to make the user experience faster
and<00:04:57.100> better<00:04:57.220> it<00:04:57.910> is<00:04:58.060> important<00:04:58.479> that<00:04:58.660> the<00:04:58.780> app

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
and better it is important that the app

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.940 
and better it is important that the app
itself<00:04:59.200> is<00:04:59.710> actually<00:05:00.430> quite<00:05:00.850> small<00:05:01.270> in<00:05:01.450> size

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
itself is actually quite small in size

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.620 
itself is actually quite small in size
so<00:05:02.950> I'll<00:05:03.370> just<00:05:03.430> go<00:05:03.760> to<00:05:03.880> the<00:05:04.000> Play<00:05:04.180> Store<00:05:04.450> to

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
so I'll just go to the Play Store to

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.909 
so I'll just go to the Play Store to
show<00:05:04.840> you<00:05:04.900> the<00:05:05.410> size<00:05:06.010> of<00:05:06.190> the<00:05:06.340> app<00:05:07.620> here<00:05:08.620> you

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
show you the size of the app here you

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.190 
show you the size of the app here you
see<00:05:09.100> clean<00:05:09.280> Oh<00:05:09.539> as<00:05:10.539> you<00:05:10.720> can<00:05:10.840> see<00:05:10.930> here<00:05:11.080> it<00:05:11.169> says

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
see clean Oh as you can see here it says

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.580 
see clean Oh as you can see here it says
that<00:05:11.530> is<00:05:11.590> less<00:05:11.830> than<00:05:12.010> 1.5<00:05:12.550> mb<00:05:13.120> in<00:05:13.210> size<00:05:13.590> well

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
that is less than 1.5 mb in size well

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.710 
that is less than 1.5 mb in size well
let's<00:05:14.919> just<00:05:15.070> take<00:05:15.190> a<00:05:15.220> look<00:05:15.400> at<00:05:15.550> how<00:05:15.880> big<00:05:16.419> it<00:05:16.600> is
