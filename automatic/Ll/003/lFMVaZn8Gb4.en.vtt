 you want to see your modern kitchen and 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.940
 dazzling come to vigo with choose your 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.550
 cook and we take care of everything 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.380
 all other kitchen and bathroom furniture 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.179
 countertops fitted wardrobes everything 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.790
 what do you want with a financing to your 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.310
 measure look no more your kitchen is in 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.800
 vigo co in Santander street one low 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.800
 I see that we make art with your kitchen 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.230
 vigo that this section offers you 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.590
 hello welcome I do not know about you but 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.550
 I have always liked to look at the world 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.100
 through a crystal 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.110
 today we are in vigo with surrounded surrounded 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.550
 of crystals that such javier hello that such 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.290
 good afternoon today we are going to talk about 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.989
 crystals truly effectively that is 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.850
 a very important part of a house 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.800
 we have a lot of differences it seems 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.630
 that the crystal is always the same but 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.610
 we do not have many varieties where 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.940
 we started well we can start so 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.620
 What is crystal glass worth? 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.390
 effectively not everything is the same but 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.699
 the crystal if everything is the same what happens 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.110
 that you work in different ways in 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.200
 this case I think we have in a crystal 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.290
 is 5 mm glass 6 mm 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.240
 thickness are normal crystals from 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.120
 of this crystal what has been achieved 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.100
 do is laminated glazings which 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.140
 are laminar is the crystals stuck 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.500
 because we can see it in this 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.360
 part or this same where you can see that 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.320
 two crystals are stuck together what 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.110
 difference would be fine this crystal if 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.840
 receives an impact or a blow would break 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.310
 totally and could cut us in the 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.049
 case of this short 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.380
 it's not crystal what it takes is a 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.270
 pvm sheet that what it does is join 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.729
 the two crystals and in the case of a 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.220
 breaking an impact what would break 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.229
 would be making a gap what 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.119
 would accredit the possible damages says that 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.850
 effectively in the case of this crystal 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.610
 we would avoid damage then from 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.399
 laminar we have here is the tempered 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.890
 here is the temperate we do not have to 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.990
 here 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.580
 which is crystal that seems to be put 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.590
 in the case of this garnet but 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.270
 good can be another type of color is a 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.759
 glass that gets into a large vats 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.800
 temperature and it cools down very quickly 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.319
 this type of crystal in the case of a 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.000
 impact what it does is to form many 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.250
 little pieces of glass what would run like 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.959
 a windshield of a car so that 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.180
 places would be suitable every type of 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.490
 crystal depending what we are going to use 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.590
 to see there are many people in the rooms 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.900
 for example many times we have the 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.720
 typical glass lounge table that by 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.160
 the bottom part is transparent many 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.930
 manufacturers or manufactures a normal crystal 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.610
 this is a problem in the event that 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.000
 let's put something there at the time of 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.410
 break could cut the legs the 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.090
 feet or a small child under the 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.340
 own glass for and it would be advisable 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.810
 placed that this sheet that occurs 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.400
 as it is more expensive by many manufacturers 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.530
 what they do is I think that even though it's so 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.480
 simple the typical shelves that 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.950
 we have in the furniture too 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.470
 usually they usually place with glass 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.450
 normal I would advise placing crystals 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.769
 laminar is because with this we avoid that 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.220
 when placing a figure that is crystal 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.890
 break and can cut us 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.510
 then on the themes of the windows that 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.760
 we talked about in previous programs of the 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.320
 aluminum carpentry for me one thing 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.450
 very important is the crystal in the 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.580
 own window because it is what greater 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.740
 surface has a window is the 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.330
 crystal and that's where many times 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.220
 we put a glass that is not suitable 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.670
 the one that we usually place the 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.569
 windows is usually this that is installed 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.120
 the weather little double glazing 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.040
 and these typical today I think that the 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.189
 windows are a day that are crystals 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.170
 normally 4 millimeters 5 millimeters 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:38.969
 each sheet of glass inside 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.760
 he carries a camera that the camera is usually 

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:44.549
 of 8 millimeters 10-12 the more thickness 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.139
 have more performance gives us that is 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.420
 exactly this camera that has inside 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:50.459
 inside what you have is air is an air 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.769
 Clean pure air and what you have is a 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:56.129
 aluminum profile that is seen all over the 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.810
 outline of the sheet so it is not 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:59.639
 that is an aluminum profile itself but 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.769
 that is perforated and inside what has 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:03.389
 silica the silica what makes us is that 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.769
 any humidity or temperature change 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:07.169
 weight that we have that can be formed 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.419
 inside the sheet itself what it does is 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:11.310
 absorb it the silicon comes being 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:13.019
 when we have the cabinets or we buy 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.000
 shoes that come the bags 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.859
 little ones so that he takes them as truth 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.229
 It is the same as the window 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.810
 internally it has a camera that 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.070
 Take Cecilia to collect moisture 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.380
 what I was commenting before the topic 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.419
 of the aluminum windows is very 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.400
 important that the crystal that we put 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:32.160
 yes, even if it's good or if it's a 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.530
 Low emissivity or be a solar control 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.750
 the low emissive what we got 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.390
 to do is that we also do not lose 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.150
 heating inside the house then 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.470
 We have self-cleaning crystals too 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.730
 for vertical areas and that are 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.490
 another clean I am well manufactured 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:50.160
 in fact factory that what is coming is 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.540
 a treatment that when the water by 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.690
 example falls on the glass itself 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:58.250
 it repels us and when the sun gives us the 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.250
 dirt that has degraded 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:04.950
 if the temperature itself what it does is 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.570
 degrade us the society that has 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.220
 then already with the wind and when we 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.290
 the rain does not just clean us 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.270
 cleaning this is usually done when they are 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.130
 covered after 20 or forgiveness facades 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.600
 back ventilated that we do not have a good 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.730
 access to clean we have them 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.710
 crystals in colors also that is not 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.030
 the crystal be for example like this 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.800
 crystal that is a crystal of green color 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.750
 the crystal is a normal crystal and 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.990
 current what happens that the queue that 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.720
 inside the pvd sheet is 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.650
 green 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.570
 effectively color keyboard this is 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.120
 an ordinary glass that 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.710
 is giving the color is the sheet that 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.180
 carries inside 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.560
 in this case it must always be a 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.630
 laminate two crystals with the foil 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.610
 inside we could be three crystals 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.410
 four crystals five crystals how much 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.040
 more crystals take us better we 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:51.270
 it works acoustically and thermally 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.790
 Javier we go to the interior of the house 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.160
 we have glass in numerous spaces in 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.990
 the tables in the kitchen in this case that 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.230
 You can tell us well, here we have 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.060
 a table that if we can focus it is 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.700
 a table that we think is broken 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.800
 and is effectively broken is broken is 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.090
 broken but it does not fall, it does not fall 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.920
 what you have is also that this plate 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.770
 ok what happens that has three 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.150
 crystals has a superior crystal one 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.030
 in the middle and another one from the bottom 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.680
 the one that is broken in the middle this like 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.720
 it is manufactured because nothing sticks the three 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.070
 crystals and then a specialist what 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.710
 It does is give you a blow in a corner 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.750
 crystal and break from the incredible medium and 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.880
 it stays that way is aesthetic I prefer it 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.410
 athletic no no then we also have in 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.090
 the cob the voucher that is a crystal too 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.770
 for indoor decoration 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.690
 the pedals for bathrooms for 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.610
 kitchen that are in colors is a crystal 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.100
 that on the outside by one of the 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.580
 forgiveness parts is painted 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:46.770
 It can be a white color with black 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:49.560
 blue green yellow but we want 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.759
 and in this case the finish is matt 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.470
 be more kind of follow can be 

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:54.900
 bright indeed in this case 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:56.639
 expression that is the brightness and here not 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.740
 I have none good mate but it can be 

00:06:56.639 --> 00:07:00.210
 matte finish or javier gloss finish 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.370
 There is one thing that has always 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.289
 very much liked that are the walls of 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.789
 pavés and right here we have a 

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:07.949
 piece of pavés tell us what it is for 

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:09.780
 can use well this also comes 

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:11.669
 being crystal and what we use is 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:14.069
 to make divisional walls so much can 

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:15.870
 be a bathroom like a living room this 

00:07:14.069 --> 00:07:17.430
 which allows us to focus clarity and 

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.599
 they do not see us at the same time it 

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.430
 because in this case it is a crystal 

00:07:18.599 --> 00:07:21.900
 transparent so it's transparent that what 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.849
 that allows us to see the silhouette what 

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:26.960
 we have in other colors acid blue 

00:07:23.849 --> 00:07:29.909
 yellow and is to make divisions 

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.889
 Javier we are happy to have
