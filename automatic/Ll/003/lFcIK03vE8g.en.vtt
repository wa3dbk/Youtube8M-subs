what you guys thought about like I said
uplink<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.470> new<00:01:34.680> game-mode<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.880> maps<00:01:36.180> you

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
uplink the new game-mode the maps you

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.569 
uplink the new game-mode the maps you
saw<00:01:36.630> we<00:01:36.869> played<00:01:37.110> five<00:01:37.740> or<00:01:37.890> six<00:01:38.070> different<00:01:38.189> Maps

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
saw we played five or six different Maps

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:39.859 
saw we played five or six different Maps
a<00:01:38.790> lot<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.030> them<00:01:39.150> were<00:01:39.360> like<00:01:39.689> really

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
a lot of them were like really

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.109 
a lot of them were like really
medium-sized<00:01:40.680> small<00:01:41.220> maps<00:01:41.579> there<00:01:41.820> were<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> lot

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
medium-sized small maps there were a lot

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.929 
medium-sized small maps there were a lot
of<00:01:42.150> engagements<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.610> obviously<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.759> biggest

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
of engagements and obviously the biggest

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.580 
of engagements and obviously the biggest
thing<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.570> movement<00:01:46.049> in<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.290> game<00:01:46.439> that's

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
thing is the movement in the game that's

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.620 
thing is the movement in the game that's
what<00:01:46.680> everybody<00:01:47.100> was<00:01:47.340> not<00:01:47.880> worried<00:01:48.210> about<00:01:48.450> but

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
what everybody was not worried about but

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.749 
what everybody was not worried about but
just<00:01:48.659> wondering<00:01:49.170> how<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.560> would<00:01:49.649> play<00:01:49.860> exactly

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
just wondering how it would play exactly

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.090 
just wondering how it would play exactly
