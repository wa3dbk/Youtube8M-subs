00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.210
 girl too cute and well I can you 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.400
 learn it if you want then I will you 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:14.099
 say the material you will need a 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:18.840
 black pen with girl tips and a 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:22.170
 blue silk pen towards you in the evening 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.859
 ok well we see how that and a sheet 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.949
 of course so to start we do a 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.949
 no 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.600
 a simple goal ah yes and by the way 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:41.620
 to make your life easier take a 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:53.010
 checkered sheet it's easier and 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:53.010
 you do 1 and 2 small as tariq 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:08.950
 then you do that and round to 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:16.030
 inside as well to connect you two 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:21.280
 little ones very high down to the two years of 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:27.220
 at the bottom you black color they are you 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:29.679
 being here is where it comes from 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:37.600
 the color in the eye is iser the eyes 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:41.740
 blue and you can do it either 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.569
 in brown glass for oneself in the 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.440
 color you want but your the 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:47.740
 eye colour 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.479
 if you want it to be natural here 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.509
 so the side he's going to stay green eyes 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.069
 but the household one end blue eyes 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:59.069
 then you make small signs in 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:59.069
 down and three big in water 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:11.650
 that's of course from there you make two 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:14.950
 eyebrows blow them up after a little 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:19.530
 mountain for it to make millions and 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:22.750
 one that clog up 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:29.709
 then for the hair you do 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:31.950
 little gimmicks like that up and and 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.450
 that's no for which ended 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.440
 my hair helmet but that's a drag on 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.980
 the end 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.420
 then made it a.ge.di 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.250
 wings but hey it's not so much of 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:49.800
 wings so that's it must give his voice 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:53.680
 there and that's it 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.900
 and we re-read by a small stroke a bow of 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.769
 circle 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.260
 no it's not my big and again it's there 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:10.110
 it gets complicated 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:14.739
 you finally do a form like his 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:19.269
 triangular can say is a continuous 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:22.959
 like that and to make the buttons have 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:28.750
 peas up and squeezing 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:36.700
 down and there we make a dress time of 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:39.750
 sailboats over there and after you are 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:44.130
 long enough legend this is what this 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.130
 seller who gives a little cute 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:04.180
 and then for all the arms 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.180
 it's very easy you do like that 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:15.800
 it does not make it so easy 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:20.720
 that's it and on the other side you 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:24.530
 do the same city too close this 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:27.550
 that you can do is do it q 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:32.540
 Lama thumb we hardly see here 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:34.820
 whose age there you see that but my 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.410
 hands are a little small but no 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:42.770
 you have to do them pretty much 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:47.290
 until the laure is then for the 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.290
 hair we will do the triplets 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:59.930
 look at it just like me and 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:00.890
 do you make yourself a little 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.970
 vaguelette 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:10.280
 hop hop 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:17.020
 yes it's like that it's good and where the 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:19.260
 final touch up and hop 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:23.580

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:25.680

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:29.700
 good I led that this one is a lot 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:32.310
 prettier his eyes are bigger fat 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.960
 no matter it's the go but it's 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.150
 just in closer together actually it's 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.950
 changing eyes 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:42.060
 Well, we can say that the fact of the good 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:45.180
