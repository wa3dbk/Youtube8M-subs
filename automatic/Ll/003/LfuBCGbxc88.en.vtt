00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
deal or whatever but I don't think that

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.860 
deal or whatever but I don't think that
would<00:04:16.739> have<00:04:16.859> been<00:04:16.949> a<00:04:16.979> responsible<00:04:17.870> exercise

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
would have been a responsible exercise

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.810 
would have been a responsible exercise
on<00:04:19.289> my<00:04:19.470> part<00:04:19.739> and<00:04:20.010> so<00:04:20.310> really<00:04:20.489> it<00:04:20.639> was<00:04:20.669> an

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
on my part and so really it was an

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.250 
on my part and so really it was an
ongoing<00:04:20.970> discussion<00:04:21.479> that's<00:04:21.900> been<00:04:22.019> very

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
ongoing discussion that's been very

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.060 
ongoing discussion that's been very
positive<00:04:22.470> I<00:04:22.830> think<00:04:22.860> and<00:04:23.340> as<00:04:24.090> with<00:04:24.389> all<00:04:24.570> good

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
positive I think and as with all good

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.279 
positive I think and as with all good
discussions<00:04:26.070> I<00:04:26.490> think<00:04:27.360> it's<00:04:27.539> it's<00:04:27.810> created<00:04:28.229> an

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
discussions I think it's it's created an

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:31.939 
discussions I think it's it's created an
even<00:04:29.150> more<00:04:30.150> important<00:04:30.659> bond<00:04:31.650> of<00:04:31.800> trust
