00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.270
 It's one of the most universally testing tools there is the knife for 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.490
 with the good knife you do not have to cut her in case of need 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.060
 you have to be able to unscrew my screws or even one 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.010
 Hit the nail that says one of the must know Matthias Harbor 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.150
 weissandt-gölzau in the district of anhalt-bitterfeld is the trade fair expert 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.689
 and not just because he works with it, but because he's in his free time 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.689
 even making knives 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.300
 if the sparks spray is Matthias 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.430
 in his element 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.600
 in his small workshop in weissandt-gölzau near Köthen he makes 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.550
 canteen 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.749
 one in front of old tool 

00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:40.940
 for millennia human use 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.430
 the chill the percent the net should be so until today exists in principle still in 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.130
 u-form percent of u-shape the Senate hand ax 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.360
 is unlikely finally or even slightly he can only say UFO form 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.030
 impenetrable 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.590
 Even as a teenager, Matthias Hafen was fascinated by knives 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.010
 He has been doing it himself for about 20 years 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.979
 the last thing I really wanted 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:07.560
 the card game SEC on this is my leadership's duty 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.010
 that you manufactured Norbert bosses 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.010
 that prices in the areas says Dieter Hoeneß 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.260
 which are the best materials to master and how they are 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.700
 all that Matthias Hassel has learned over the years 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.330
 a good start for the blade and natural materials for the handle shells 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.310
 This time Matthias Hassel is crying for giraffes 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.509
 Actually he works as a train driver Masur is his hobby that he is with 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.899
 works a lot of manual skills and thus the knife well in the hand 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.899
 The weight must be optimally distributed 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.950
 the real one from Monroe the Knife decides first in hand 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.340
 Percent feel when the house needs like Gomez for this work 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.910
 For example, today with 18 percent headed for this lead 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.070
 should therefore be quite good in the hand 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.969
 Matthias Hassel has meanwhile produced more than 500 trade fairs 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.590
 All the unique pieces also write the songs and the elaborate engravings he makes 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.360
 even all his pride is looking for this one here in 2004 the most beautiful Bonamassa 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:14.349
 will vote is the readers of a trade magazine about 140 submissions 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.299
 Second place I was proud of part 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:21.120
 Among the first twelve placed today only become amateur and are 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.879
 been more professional 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.999
 I should but I've made them in memory of Johnny Cash 

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:30.889
 from Ines Krause 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:34.749
 which, for its sake, will oblige even these ministries to become even smaller 

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:39.409
 and then the songs of Kahn swing a bit like the Matthiasstraße 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:40.890
 for the middle class is right 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.919
 and it sounds like his idol himself 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:46.809
 Margarethen 

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:49.399
 Walter Breuning 

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:50.669
 Dollars in cash 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:53.669
 Harry Roels 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.749
 Choose Valverde solutions 

00:02:56.749 --> 00:02:59.099
 wants to take 0 euros 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.099
 Galler Bank Wegelin 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.669
 the man should then think about a second career
