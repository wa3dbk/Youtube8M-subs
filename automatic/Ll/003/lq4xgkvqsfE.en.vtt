00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
it's become so popular I think it's

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:55.670 
it's become so popular I think it's
because<00:04:53.910> of<00:04:54.090> the<00:04:54.270> bikinis<00:04:54.720> and<00:04:54.900> because<00:04:55.650> of

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
because of the bikinis and because of

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.260 
because of the bikinis and because of
the<00:04:55.889> hot<00:04:56.070> bodies<00:04:56.430> that<00:04:56.460> are<00:04:56.639> on<00:04:56.789> show<00:04:57.000> all<00:04:57.150> the

the hot bodies that are on show all the

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.940 
the hot bodies that are on show all the
time<00:04:57.300> and<00:04:57.780> I<00:04:57.990> think<00:04:58.229> because<00:04:58.380> we're<00:04:58.740> playing

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950
