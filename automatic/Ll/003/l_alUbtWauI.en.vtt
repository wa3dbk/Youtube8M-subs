00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.909
 good anyway to a new video already 

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:06.310
 finally a gameplay has been shown 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:07.750
 Decalogue fans warfare I'll try to put 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.520
 the description as to you if you are 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.770
 since it will already be in the description 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.600
 put and basically what we've seen 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.330
 in this example I the truth seen 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.130
 very poor quality looked very bad 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.290
 streaming but yes it was quite noticeable 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.910
 a much better graphic change if 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.039
 we compare with kalou ticos with which 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.960
 the first graphic touch we have already 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.510
 seen changed absolutely you notice that 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.369
 it is not graphic engine or that it is the same 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.100
 stand was very very well polished the truth 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.630
 so by that point well enough 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.420
 then what was read in play as it has 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.090
 been with the suit we go for the 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.070
 city ​​and so on basically what's typical of 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.230
 caloto and a normal game a shooter in 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.000
 first normal and good person with the 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.649
 with the addition that here we are going to do 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.630
 quite different, not because of what has been 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.550
 seen is something similar but everything 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.980
 compare a compadre game I would compare it 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.770
 with titón fault in which then we have 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.290
 the ex or suit this allows us then 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.780
 jumping higher is jumping faster 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.420
 also have more strength and this kind of 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.649
 things even push us towards towards 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.850
 the addresses and so on according to 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:08.560
 seen in him 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.759
 in the gameplay not something pretty like 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.470
 to what we can do within the 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.299
 titans of fall failed but being a 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.670
 person we could say in addition to it 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.440
 then also stick the biggest and 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.560
 plan strength and then the way 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.970
 we were a jetpack so the game was 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.470
 confirm that it will be a style like that 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.700
 different we do not know if in the 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.200
 multiplayer we will also have these 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.930
 skills or what but everything has 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.390
 quite a pint that can be like that 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.280
 Regarding weapons, we've seen a 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.770
 automatic weapon of a jump rifle 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.659
 automatic that went pretty well in the 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.890
 story logically and then also from 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.509
 an anti-riot school that 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.429
 appeared quite pigs and what have me 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.009
 online a pretty big bitch was not 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:47.200
 a shield that covered your entire body and 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.119
 as he pointed, the glass was lowered 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.649
 milestone or rose when the java is 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.520
 pointing something to fuck pretty 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:56.649
 then also the grenades that we could 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.380
 select between two we could 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.909
 say and that marked the enemies 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.100
 we do not know how to be in the multiplayer 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.250
 also but it can be something pretty 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.420
 balancing to do a secondary 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.489
 good nothing more kids this has been 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.929
 all the video has been pretty short 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.370
 of the company and pretty short and nothing 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.370
 less in the next video is coming
