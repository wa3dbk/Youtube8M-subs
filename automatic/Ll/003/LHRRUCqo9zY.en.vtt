00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.750
 jaime world health art and good give us your 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.189
 conclusions around the summit 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.450
 global UFO that was developed 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:20.700
 practically a few days ago 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.310
 Well, I think it's an event that 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.490
 exceeded expectations that were not 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.820
 only of the attendees but of the 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.160
 own lecturers opinions 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.680
 I think they can be found in 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.809
 many internet pages around 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.300
 the quality of this event the 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.880
 importance of the transcendence of the 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.410
 quality of the papers and therefore 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.180
 I think we are very satisfied I 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.910
 I hope this is the beginning on 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.550
 beginning 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.140
 of events of this level that may be 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.810
 presented in Mexico I think they do 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.710
 lack 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.710
 zero point 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.200
 had a very good response from 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.360
 of the people of Mexican society and of 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.380
 the media if there was more 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:09.320
 of 130 registered media there were 1,200 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.830
 people who attended the 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.140
 summit so I think that everything 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.840
 the level was very well the place in the 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.540
 composition how things were done 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.400
 Well, they look fantastic to me now 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.830
 The only thing that is missing is that we can put 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.280
 available to people is the 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.890
 series of the presentations of the videos that 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:36.189
 so many people are not only 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:38.900
 asking demanding they like 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:40.940
 2.0 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.380
 very well you have contemplated maybe 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.600
 some date for the sale of these 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.310
 materials is not but it is not in my 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.230
 hands I hope that in the coming days 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.810
 I'm insisting a lot that this 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.510
 is done now and I hope that the next 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.360
 days we have the possibility of 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.250
 announce exactly when I do not think that 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.310
 spend a couple of weeks that people 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.780
 I can buy this 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.580
 zero point 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.229
 globally like that from this summit 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.700
 as the best in the world because because 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.560
 attended the best doctorates not 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.530
 but all those who attended were 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.170
 good I think the results the 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.600
 information that was given is a principle 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.420
 not here the important thing is that you could 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.130
 keep this project and that in your eyes 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.890
 you can bring all those who do not 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.800
 they came now because well this I believe 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.720
 that there are more than 50 researchers 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:36.290
 prominent in this field and we brought 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.840
 only to I do not know 15 18 of them are missing 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.820
 some more so that finally it 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.269
 can say that all the best have 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.269
 come here 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.060
 they came from 14 of the most important ones to 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.580
 world level and Mexicans participated 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:58.050
 Mexican researchers who were 16 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:00.030
 in total but there the question jaime is 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.520
 really Mexicans a 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.890
 UFO investigation can be at 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.690
 same level as in other countries I think 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.550
 that is even above I do not know 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.260
 I think that the presentations that 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.620
 presented on behalf of the Mexicans has 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.290
 been of sample the hunters of 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.480
 UFOs this showed off I think that 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.200
 also good some researchers from 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.569
 Mexico 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.340
 yohanan dÃ­az well I also think that it was 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.260
 very applauded like this is time 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.000
 I think it was fine and the anac line 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.769
 mail the level of research in 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.500
 Mexico is different from the one you want in 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.849
 us we are going more in search of the 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.829
 evidences the evidence given that the 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:36.790
 events happen here and I think it's the 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.790
 importance they have 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.850
 that we hope we should wait for 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.220
 200 months in this whole matter 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.350
 around the summit so hopefully that 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.870
 you can specify that you can 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.910
 develop next year and if it's not 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.410
 so I hope that no more than two years 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.920
 may be talking about another complete 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.920
 Similary 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.020
 also one of the papers he called 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.390
 much attention was yours about the 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.070
 be of metepec a being that has been 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.600
 used by the media 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.450
 internationally as the baby 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.270
 extraterrestrial and at some point the 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.100
 size if at any time jaime had 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.920
 you named it after where does this come from 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.989
 not good name that one of the 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:24.110
 first analyzes this would prove that 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.330
 it does not have roots in the teeth that's why 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.570
 they have not been extracted to look for the DNA 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.520
 and this made us assume in the first instance 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.650
 that that 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.140
 very young specimen and it can not be anything 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.500
 more than other experts too 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:43.860
 they suggested that he was already an adult not 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:46.410
 I do not know too the size I think 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.570
 influences the type of head what pink 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.340
 the head that reminds us a lot of 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.290
 babies of humans not then 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.890
 I think that may be the reason why 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.720
 which has been said to be a clear baby the 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.880
 first one went what we supposed or 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.550
 some experts assumed by the 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.610
 own characteristics of the world 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.830
 but yes 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.469
 I still have two questions, Jaime Maussan 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.270
 one of them how is the progress going as 

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:15.030
 to the investigation of this of this being 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.629
 well this very well 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:21.689
 we have already had the opportunity to 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:24.539
 contact more experts and also from 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:26.250
 generate more tests for example the 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:28.080
 tomography is talking a lot about that 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.719
 if it 's a titi monkey or if it's a monkey 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:35.099
 squirrel we could get the 

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:37.740
 corpse of a squirrel monkey and that stops 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:41.039
 many is the same as the marmoset and has 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:43.500
 compared to the tomography of both no 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:46.250
 beyond what a 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.240
 witness, whatever it is, I think the 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.029
 evidence of the analysis is what 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.270
 matter and in that sense I can tell you 

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:54.940
 what 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.920
 what the expert analyzed that what 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.710
 here in Mexico the two experts that 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:02.020
 They saw that it has nothing to do 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.009
 it has nothing to do with being metepec with 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.289
 a titi monkey 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:08.169
 but I 'm going to present the facts I think 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:10.520
 that here is what matters most because 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:12.649
 Anybody can talk 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.889
 Yes, I made a joke and tricked them 

00:06:12.649 --> 00:06:18.080
 all that if I do not know what you can have 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:21.439
 other reasons the reasons may be 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:24.740
 economic or sometimes revenge or 

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:26.569
 rematch not then I think the 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.659
 analysis of the cells of the body of the 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:31.909
 most important sex as it is said 

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:35.750
 design your head the way your clan is 

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:38.000
 more important to suppose that 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.250
 it is not something I think 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.290
 in the end things will stay in their 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:44.090
 place and people are going to have the 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:46.280
 correct information in how much time 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:49.730
 you think you want to know I do not know 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:51.680
 I've been a year and a half and I'm presenting 

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.240
 right now there is a set there is a new 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.880
 website is called being of 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.500
 metepec dotcom and there we will be 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.930
 presenting information concerning 

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.030
 this being to avoid some of the 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:03.910
 speculations that have come general 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:07.760
 surely from April 5 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:10.720
 we could assume that he will be in 

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.720
 availability 

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:21.420
 to the summit and not about respect etc that 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:23.100
 we will continue investigating what to me 

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:25.919
 it seems to me that the people who are talking 

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:29.010
 is not presenting proof does not present 

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:31.500
 comparative presents its positions the 

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:34.200
 be we have it here the investigation the 

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:36.210
 we have done with scientists through 

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.100
 this means we are not manipulating 

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:39.930
 absolutely nothing we are saying the 

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:42.330
 Truth then then it will weigh whoever 

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:44.990
 although it hurts whoever hurts 

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.990
 there are the facts 

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.680
 dual ravi with the story one of the 

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:53.870
 more important cases very soon if the 

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.430
 third millennium to the third millennium 

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.990
 just as the story of are roman is 

00:07:55.430 --> 00:08:01.000
 that will also be very good 

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:01.000
 the two thanks
