down the grant and now they're producing
a<00:02:55.960> new<00:02:55.990> grant<00:02:56.350> in<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:57.040> process<00:02:57.580> we've<00:02:58.390> done

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
a new grant in the process we've done

a new grant in the process we've done
for<00:02:59.080> self<00:02:59.920> funded<00:03:00.310> studies<00:03:00.580> this<00:03:00.760> year<00:03:01.210> some

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
for self funded studies this year some

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:02.760 
for self funded studies this year some
pilot<00:03:01.930> studies<00:03:02.170> because<00:03:02.380> we<00:03:02.470> need<00:03:02.590> some

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
pilot studies because we need some

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.050 
pilot studies because we need some
pilots<00:03:03.070> that<00:03:03.220> he's<00:03:03.310> done<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.550> get<00:03:03.670> bigger

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
pilots that he's done to get bigger

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.790 
pilots that he's done to get bigger
front<00:03:04.360> to<00:03:04.450> get<00:03:04.570> bigger<00:03:05.080> funding<00:03:05.470> and<00:03:05.590> grants

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
front to get bigger funding and grants

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.670 
front to get bigger funding and grants
and<00:03:07.170> so<00:03:08.170> we've<00:03:08.410> produced<00:03:08.770> a<00:03:08.980> study<00:03:09.250> on<00:03:09.960> on<00:03:10.960> the

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
and so we've produced a study on on the

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.130 
and so we've produced a study on on the
changing<00:03:12.310> perception<00:03:12.790> of<00:03:12.880> hunger<00:03:13.210> a<00:03:13.390> diabetes

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
pilot study and we've done that we've

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.300 
pilot study and we've done that we've
worked<00:03:16.840> on<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:16.990> migraine<00:03:17.350> study<00:03:17.650> and<00:03:17.920> we've

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
worked on the migraine study and we've

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
worked on the migraine study and we've
done<00:03:18.460> a<00:03:18.520> survey<00:03:19.210> study<00:03:19.690> on<00:03:20.850> an<00:03:21.850> autoimmune

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
done a survey study on an autoimmune

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.300 
done a survey study on an autoimmune
condition<00:03:22.510> we<00:03:23.020> did<00:03:23.140> a<00:03:23.170> member<00:03:23.680> survey<00:03:24.040> study

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
condition we did a member survey study

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.680 
condition we did a member survey study
and<00:03:24.520> a<00:03:24.550> white<00:03:24.700> blood<00:03:24.850> cell<00:03:24.910> study<00:03:25.270> we<00:03:25.390> started

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
and a white blood cell study we started

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.560 
and a white blood cell study we started
some<00:03:25.870> studies<00:03:26.200> going<00:03:26.470> on<00:03:26.590> right<00:03:26.770> now<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:27.940> so

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
some studies going on right now and so

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.780 
some studies going on right now and so
we're<00:03:28.690> working<00:03:28.720> on<00:03:29.400> protocols<00:03:30.400> but<00:03:30.610> it's

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
we're working on protocols but it's

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.400 
we're working on protocols but it's
we're<00:03:31.120> finding<00:03:31.480> out<00:03:31.660> that<00:03:31.810> to<00:03:31.930> get<00:03:32.050> studies

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
we're finding out that to get studies

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.110 
we're finding out that to get studies

face of American medicine we have to

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.650 
face of American medicine we have to
design<00:03:48.520> a<00:03:48.550> series<00:03:49.000> of<00:03:49.030> studies<00:03:49.300> in<00:03:49.540> each

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
design a series of studies in each

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.900 
design a series of studies in each
studies<00:03:49.959> each<00:03:50.290> study<00:03:50.590> costs<00:03:51.370> over<00:03:51.670> a<00:03:51.700> million

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
studies each study costs over a million

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.900 
studies each study costs over a million
dollars<00:03:52.300> to<00:03:52.420> do<00:03:52.540> so<00:03:53.290> we<00:03:53.470> start<00:03:53.709> so<00:03:53.950> I<00:03:54.190> spoke<00:03:54.760> to
