00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.530
 of what I have entered into the web of

 this time the ultimate team this is the 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.250
 rival the first opponent that I have for 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:27.050
 to play as you see as a rival 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.079
 similar to my team more or less than 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.029
 valuation 76 with complementation 250 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.260
 out there not much rapport the 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.489
 true 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:40.250
 and well we face the first game with 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.850
 a team that is very bad I say 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.949
 up altidor and pavón 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.410
 and well we go directly with the 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:50.500
 goals there are long balls for peacock and 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:54.519
 this was going to be my first goal in default 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.140
 and mate team with peacock two players very 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:59.890
 altidore different Pavon and killed 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.079
 slow and rough peacock faster and more agile and 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.550
 2nd 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.610
 the truth that the team is very bad 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.649
 except saving the goalkeeper diego lopez and 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.990
 in the middle that is to sandro 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:12.630
 sandro that good here you have it sandro 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.060
 takes a ball inside the area and fixes 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.159
 that launch of sandro only two 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.140
 players so they are saved more diego 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.360
 lopez and sandro in terms of means and in 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.030
 The truth is that they are what most 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.369
 I like them better and well, I started very 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.300
 well the game winning so that 2 to 0 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:33.310
 well we are already in the second part 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.890
 here is peacock ball for altidore 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.220
 altidore for pavón pavón for 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.350
 for this then and a very name 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.030
 strange but also the premier 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.280
 accompanying the mcd with 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.110
 with sandro the two of the premier league 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.150
 once it is very rough but how good that 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.890
 covers a lot of ground and steals well steals 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.500
 good balls inside what fits 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.860
 good first match first victory 0 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.200
 3 we are already with the second you see the team 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.899
 rival a team well enough 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.970
 malillo especially the defense and in the 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.700
 goal though good this of ultimate 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.160
 team the truth is that it gives equal 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.569
 the first goal first goal mine 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.610
 he scored the corner I do not like anything 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.019
 corners or mark the corner or that I 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.660
 mark the corner but good is what 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:21.350
 there is this game is like that there are many goals 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.180
 in the corners and the goal is from altidore 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.760
 we continue with the game and the second 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.310
 part were going to make a triangle element 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.470
 look at my defense as it stands still and 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.780
 get to mark me mark with the e1 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.600
 triangle that could not do anything to 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.010
 they tell me it stayed as you see it is not going to 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.680
 put good is for the ball but it 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.590
 forward runs much more forward and 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.870
 the tie but good there is hair 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.390
 ball for altidor within the area 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.629
 I was falling very well I could not 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.799
 find space but little by little 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.549
 taking a little bit more by changing a 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.250
 little the rhythm 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.270
 altidore lebanon back and peacock was going to 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.420
 finish the 2 to 1 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.760
 for the moment I was victorious 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.950
 with nine points it went up to ninth 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:11.280
 division with twelve of the league and this one then 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.370
 it would be the first six points 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.650
 fix that good pass good play and 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.810
 fatten the hair goal by the league 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.959
 French that does not convince me much but 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:25.110
 good has been making goals and good this 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.220
 already confirmed the six points that I 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.680
 I was going to take 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:34.120
 or so it seemed because there was ireland 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:37.480
 a ball in a triangle but he tied it with 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.810
 the defender totally shit and 3-2 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:45.069
 careful that the game was not over 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:47.430
 32 this game was I had enough 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.920
 domain but well there I had an error 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.510
 finally ended like this 32 wins six 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.490
 six points possible and we go with the 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.490
 third party 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.470
 here you see rapport already 99 a 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.020
 pretty serious team already with the league 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.500
 French that was going to overtake 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.170
 corner 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.700
 with a goal from Marquinhos and I'm going to put 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:11.040
 the complicated things and to begin with 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.140
 but well there we were again ball 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.340
 from Rodriguez on the right side that 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.220
 I do not like it either, it's a pretty player 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.400
 bad the ball for sandro sandro and 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:23.120
 penalty in front of my favor could give 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.120
 the tie 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.590
 I was going to throw it with good hair 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.980
 has 75 penalties 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.300
 there is 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.580
 the launch and the goals 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.770
 tie one 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.900
 137 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.900
 if he won this game he went up to ninth 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:49.510
 and here is an Altidore move that 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.870
 by force you can see that it takes everything 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:55.660
 towards the eye to the center and then 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.980
 shabby peacock that they put two to 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.780
 one 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:02.520
 the truth that the goal is very sad 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.069
 but it is what is there that counts 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.830
 there was not going to finish the thing my rival was going 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:09.539
 how was he going to tie me with this goal of 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.970
 bounce the truth that you are not seeing 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.770
 very spectacular goals in truth the 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.840
 true that much much bounce goal of 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.810
 corner in the ultimate print and 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.699
 good 90 minute was going to be a draw no 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:24.000
 that I was not going to give that classification the 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:26.009
 ninth math but eye last play 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.090
 where it seems gravitated not worth it 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:30.569
 that he had to be killed now the 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.340
 fifth I do not throw but there's the rebound and 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:33.509
 another goal quite regrettable even more 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.870
 sorry I believe because it is in the 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:39.060
 minute 90 then he was going to give me those 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.950
 three dots if we go up the ninth 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.980
 division 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:45.690
 but I still had to play to see if I could get 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.360
 the league title the tenth title 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:50.750
 division is another party more 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.550
 a match that was going to be against this 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.449
 this player who had the league to the 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.030
 players of the German league and 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:59.759
 rapport 100 was going to start the 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:02.370
 pretty good match altidore shot and the 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:04.139
 reject for hair abella that of charge 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.560
 the truth that giving good results 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:08.510
 when on the left 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.790
 always showing up 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:14.800
 but it was not going to be easier to get 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:17.319
 the league title that won this move 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.560
 a play that I have the goal and the 

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:19.560
 against 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:24.289
 they were going to mess it up 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:27.949
 with what would come or tried to pull 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:31.659
 less the goal of the tie for kevin 

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:31.659
 prince boateng new schalke player 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:40.050
 look at this already with the goalkeeper there 

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:42.809
 shit monumental ball for olic and goal 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.099
 and I'm losing 12 against the team 

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:47.039
 German that was costing me a lot 

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:49.050
 enter your area with rapport 100 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:51.149
 the thing got complicated and in 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.409
 images of the second ball 

00:06:51.149 --> 00:06:56.769
 altidore fijaros Altidor 

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:59.619
 the Altidore goal is brutal 

00:06:56.769 --> 00:07:01.360
 by the way after finishing this tenth 

00:06:59.619 --> 00:07:04.500
 division I'm trying to sell 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.090
 because good you'll see 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.640
 that after finishing this then silva 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:10.440
 negredo quite slow but good comes 

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.120
 to be the same a billet striker for 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.129
 do not miss many eyeballs to this goal 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.619
 eye to this 

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:18.989
 loaded monumental the goalkeeper another goal 

00:07:16.619 --> 00:07:20.950
 a little sad but that is there and that 

00:07:18.989 --> 00:07:23.969
 account 

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:26.009
 was going to be the comeback 

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:28.739
 and there will be the 3 to 2 that gave us 

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:31.469
 the league gave us the promotion to the ninth 

00:07:28.739 --> 00:07:32.610
 division as you see degree degree and yes 

00:07:31.469 --> 00:07:34.199
 other kids I hope that I have 

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:35.759
 liked and if you want it to keep going up 

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:38.839
 ultimate first, you can comment and see you 

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:38.839
 in the next until another
