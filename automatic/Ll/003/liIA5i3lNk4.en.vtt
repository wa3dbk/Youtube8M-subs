00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
drip-dry drops from OPI and it doesn't

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.390 
drip-dry drops from OPI and it doesn't
matter<00:01:02.190> which<00:01:02.550> brand<00:01:02.910> you're<00:01:03.210> choosing<00:01:04.400> but

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
matter which brand you're choosing but

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.399 
matter which brand you're choosing but
these<00:01:05.670> work<00:01:05.939> really<00:01:06.210> well<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.960> optional

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
these work really well this is optional

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.100 
these work really well this is optional
you<00:01:07.470> don't<00:01:07.619> need<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.460> for<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:09.110> manicure

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
you don't need this for this manicure

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.340 
you don't need this for this manicure
but<00:01:10.939> you<00:01:11.939> can't<00:01:12.240> use<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.479> top<00:01:12.780> coat<00:01:12.810> because

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
but you can't use a top coat because

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.020 
but you can't use a top coat because
then<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.740> will<00:01:13.860> smudge<00:01:14.159> your<00:01:14.369> design<00:01:14.760> so

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
then you will smudge your design so

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.730 
then you will smudge your design so
that's<00:01:15.210> why<00:01:15.390> I'm<00:01:15.570> using<00:01:15.750> these<00:01:16.110> drops<00:01:16.380> because

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
that's why I'm using these drops because

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.499 
that's why I'm using these drops because
they<00:01:16.890> won't<00:01:17.070> smudge<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.759> then<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.270> don't

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
they won't smudge and then you don't

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.510 
they won't smudge and then you don't
have<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.840> wait<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.320> long<00:01:19.380> till<00:01:20.009> your<00:01:20.189> polish
