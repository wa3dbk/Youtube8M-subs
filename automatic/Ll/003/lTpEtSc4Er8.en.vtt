was a kid I was probably about six seven
years<00:00:43.620> old<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:44.129> pulled<00:00:44.489> out<00:00:44.579> one<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.789> my<00:00:44.910> front

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.440 
years old I pulled out one of my front
teeth<00:00:45.980> because<00:00:46.980> another<00:00:47.219> tooth<00:00:47.700> fell<00:00:47.969> out<00:00:48.000> and

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
I got money for it so I thought it was a

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.049 
I got money for it so I thought it was a
good<00:00:51.239> little<00:00:51.420> scam<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.070> pulled<00:00:53.340> out<00:00:53.430> my<00:00:53.489> one

of my front teeth mum freaked out

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.930 
of my front teeth mum freaked out
because<00:00:57.350> obviously<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.710> little<00:00:59.309> son<00:00:59.640> just

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
because obviously a little son just

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.790 
because obviously a little son just
pulled<00:00:59.969> out<00:01:00.300> one<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.600> front<00:01:00.870> teeth<00:01:01.109> one<00:01:01.710> of

and the dental hospital said that they

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.469 
and the dental hospital said that they
could<00:01:07.680> put<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.040> back<00:01:08.189> in<00:01:08.460> but<00:01:09.030> we<00:01:09.119> didn't<00:01:09.330> have

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
could put it back in but we didn't have

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.170 
could put it back in but we didn't have
it<00:01:09.689> she<00:01:10.080> threw<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.409> away<00:01:10.610> so<00:01:11.610> they<00:01:11.760> moved<00:01:11.970> my

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
it she threw it away so they moved my

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.090 
it she threw it away so they moved my
teeth<00:01:12.420> across<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.960> had<00:01:13.110> one<00:01:13.290> front<00:01:13.560> tooth<00:01:13.830> and

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
teeth across I had one front tooth and

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.499 
teeth across I had one front tooth and
then<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.180> fell<00:01:15.509> over<00:01:15.540> when<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.200> was<00:01:16.320> like<00:01:16.470> 16

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
then I fell over when I was like 16

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.210 
then I fell over when I was like 16
smashed<00:01:18.509> my<00:01:18.720> one<00:01:19.020> front<00:01:19.290> tooth<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:19.799> got<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> I

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
smashed my one front tooth and I got a I

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.060 
smashed my one front tooth and I got a I
got<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.520> sort<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.630> cat<00:01:21.900> put<00:01:22.290> over<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.009> I

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
got a sort of a cat put over it and I

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.450 
got a sort of a cat put over it and I
went<00:01:23.250> sort<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.729> gray<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.450> color<00:01:25.220> over<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.250> period

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
went sort of gray in color over a period

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.700 
went sort of gray in color over a period
of<00:01:26.640> time<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.150> then<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.360> got<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.750> silver<00:01:28.110> tooth<00:01:28.439> put

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
of time so then I got a silver tooth put

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.090 
of time so then I got a silver tooth put
in<00:01:29.689> yeah<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.960> basically<00:01:31.320> what<00:01:31.710> happened<00:01:32.040> was

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
in yeah and basically what happened was

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.899 
in yeah and basically what happened was
I<00:01:32.250> ended<00:01:32.520> up<00:01:32.729> getting<00:01:33.020> most<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.170> my<00:01:34.259> teeth<00:01:34.530> in

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
I ended up getting most of my teeth in

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.569 
I ended up getting most of my teeth in
silver<00:01:36.740> because<00:01:37.740> like<00:01:37.890> my<00:01:38.009> whole<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.430> whole

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
silver because like my whole the whole

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.310 
silver because like my whole the whole
theory<00:01:38.939> behind<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.329> one<00:01:39.479> tooth<00:01:39.810> was<00:01:40.079> there

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
theory behind the one tooth was there

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.560 
theory behind the one tooth was there
because<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:40.979> was<00:01:41.070> going<00:01:41.310> dark<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.850> hope<00:01:42.030> I've

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
because it was going dark I hope I've

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.999 
because it was going dark I hope I've
got<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.780> bit<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.049> complex<00:01:43.409> about<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.799> because

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
got a bit of a complex about it because

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.679 
got a bit of a complex about it because
it<00:01:44.130> was<00:01:44.240> standing<00:01:45.240> out<00:01:45.740> so<00:01:47.270> so<00:01:48.270> then<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.479> thought

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
it was standing out so so then I thought

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.210 
it was standing out so so then I thought
well<00:01:48.840> instead<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.229> getting<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.500> complex<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.130> I'm

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
well instead of getting a complex so I'm

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.010 
well instead of getting a complex so I'm
just<00:01:50.340> gonna<00:01:50.460> make<00:01:50.759> enhance<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.780> got<00:01:51.960> it

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
just gonna make enhance it so I got it

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.300 
just gonna make enhance it so I got it
made<00:01:52.140> silver<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:54.500> once<00:01:55.500> I've<00:01:55.680> obviously<00:01:56.040> got

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
made silver so once I've obviously got

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.420 
made silver so once I've obviously got
all<00:01:56.520> my<00:01:56.670> teeth<00:01:56.880> silver<00:01:57.890> through<00:01:58.890> dental

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
all my teeth silver through dental

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.170 
all my teeth silver through dental
reasons<00:02:00.030> not<00:02:00.360> cosmetic<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.640> had<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.850> get<00:02:03.030> my

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
reasons not cosmetic I had to get my

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.260 
reasons not cosmetic I had to get my
