00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
that the quality on the galaxy s2 is

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.300 
that the quality on the galaxy s2 is
much<00:01:12.180> more<00:01:12.390> vibrant<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.619> quality<00:01:14.010> only

deciding<00:01:25.890> which<00:01:26.009> camera<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:27.479> best<00:01:27.810> let

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
deciding which camera is it the best let

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.690 
deciding which camera is it the best let
me<00:01:28.710> take<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.040> look<00:01:29.280> at<00:01:29.369> this<00:01:29.520> guy<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:31.700> yeah

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
me take a look at this guy and yeah

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.690 
me take a look at this guy and yeah
that's<00:01:33.360> pretty<00:01:33.810> much<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.890> for<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.490> day

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
that's pretty much it for the day

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.020 
that's pretty much it for the day
lighting<00:01:35.970> test<00:01:36.950> so<00:01:37.950> that's<00:01:38.220> how<00:01:38.400> they<00:01:38.579> perform

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
lighting test so that's how they perform

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.390 
lighting test so that's how they perform
in<00:01:39.270> high<00:01:39.570> lighting<00:01:39.930> conditions<00:01:40.500> let's<00:01:40.920> take<00:01:41.220> a

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
in high lighting conditions let's take a

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.219 
in high lighting conditions let's take a
look<00:01:41.700> on<00:01:41.880> how<00:01:42.090> they<00:01:42.270> perform<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.720> low<00:01:42.960> lighting

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
look on how they perform in low lighting

00:01:43.229 --> 00:02:13.910 
look on how they perform in low lighting
conditions<00:01:43.860> with<00:01:44.040> LED<00:01:44.490> flash<00:01:44.520> on

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.120 

so<00:02:14.790> that's<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.810> performance<00:02:16.590> in<00:02:16.860> low

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
so that's the performance in low

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.390 
so that's the performance in low
lighting<00:02:17.340> conditions<00:02:17.970> like<00:02:18.240> night<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:19.400> yes

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
lighting conditions like night and yes

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.460 
lighting conditions like night and yes
so<00:02:20.880> that<00:02:21.120> is<00:02:21.300> how<00:02:21.860> does<00:02:22.860> look<00:02:23.190> I<00:02:23.840> turn<00:02:24.840> on<00:02:24.870> the

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
so that is how does look I turn on the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.030 
so that is how does look I turn on the
LED<00:02:25.950> flash<00:02:27.140> so<00:02:28.140> that's<00:02:28.440> about<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.800> video

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
LED flash so that's about the video

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.550 
LED flash so that's about the video
quality<00:02:29.400> let's<00:02:30.060> just<00:02:30.570> take<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:30.840> look<00:02:31.110> at<00:02:31.320> some

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
quality let's just take a look at some

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:42.280 
quality let's just take a look at some
pictures<00:02:31.800> that<00:02:32.220> I<00:02:32.400> captured<00:02:33.030> yesterday

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:53.250 

you

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260

so<00:02:54.160> guys<00:02:54.340> that<00:02:54.670> is<00:02:54.700> pretty<00:02:55.090> much<00:02:55.180> it<00:02:55.360> for<00:02:55.420> this

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
so guys that is pretty much it for this

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:56.930 
so guys that is pretty much it for this
