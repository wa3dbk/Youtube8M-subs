thing to do is get the old fixed blade
propeller<00:00:16.480> off<00:00:16.720> the<00:00:16.930> shaft<00:00:17.170> once<00:00:17.830> the<00:00:17.980> fixed

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.250 
propeller off the shaft once the fixed

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.729 
propeller off the shaft once the fixed
fixed<00:00:18.700> blade<00:00:18.910> is<00:00:19.029> off<00:00:19.240> remove<00:00:19.930> the<00:00:20.200> key<00:00:20.439> from

00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:20.739 
fixed blade is off remove the key from

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:22.019 
fixed blade is off remove the key from
the<00:00:21.340> shaft

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:22.029 
the shaft

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:24.479 
the shaft
what's<00:00:23.020> the<00:00:23.140> key<00:00:23.349> is<00:00:23.470> off<00:00:23.650> slide<00:00:24.009> the<00:00:24.250> hub<00:00:24.460> of

00:00:24.479 --> 00:00:24.489 
what's the key is off slide the hub of

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:26.130 
what's the key is off slide the hub of
the<00:00:24.669> max<00:00:24.880> prop<00:00:25.150> or<00:00:25.390> the<00:00:25.450> max<00:00:25.660> will<00:00:25.989> hold

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
the max prop or the max will hold

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.940 
the max prop or the max will hold
together<00:00:26.820> onto<00:00:27.820> the<00:00:28.029> shaft<00:00:28.529> taking<00:00:29.529> the<00:00:29.590> devil

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:29.950 
together onto the shaft taking the devil

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.319 
together onto the shaft taking the devil
mark<00:00:30.160> there<00:00:30.340> like<00:00:30.460> a<00:00:30.489> sharpie<00:00:31.000> and<00:00:31.029> draw<00:00:31.149> a

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:31.329 
mark there like a sharpie and draw a

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:33.450 
mark there like a sharpie and draw a
line<00:00:31.540> behind<00:00:32.020> it<00:00:32.200> right<00:00:32.710> up<00:00:32.829> against<00:00:33.160> the<00:00:33.250> hub

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
line behind it right up against the hub

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.010 
line behind it right up against the hub
so<00:00:33.700> you<00:00:33.790> get<00:00:33.970> a<00:00:34.000> reference<00:00:34.210> point<00:00:34.660> as<00:00:34.780> to<00:00:34.809> how

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020 
so you get a reference point as to how

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.900 
so you get a reference point as to how
far<00:00:35.320> the<00:00:35.530> propeller<00:00:35.890> slides<00:00:36.250> onto<00:00:36.489> the<00:00:36.670> shaft

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
far the propeller slides onto the shaft

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.450 
far the propeller slides onto the shaft
once<00:00:37.870> you've<00:00:38.020> got<00:00:38.170> your<00:00:38.200> mark<00:00:38.590> just<00:00:39.130> slide<00:00:39.340> the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
once you've got your mark just slide the

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.480 
once you've got your mark just slide the
hub<00:00:39.640> back<00:00:39.820> off<00:00:41.430> put<00:00:42.430> the<00:00:42.520> key<00:00:42.700> back<00:00:42.910> in<00:00:43.440> and

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:44.490 
hub back off put the key back in and

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.640 
hub back off put the key back in and
slide<00:00:45.490> the<00:00:45.610> propeller<00:00:45.970> back<00:00:46.240> onto<00:00:46.480> the<00:00:46.690> shaft

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:49.650 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.620 

once<00:00:50.650> it<00:00:50.770> slides<00:00:51.010> on<00:00:51.280> look<00:00:52.090> and<00:00:52.270> make<00:00:52.390> sure<00:00:52.420> it

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630 
once it slides on look and make sure it

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.270 
once it slides on look and make sure it
goes<00:00:52.750> the<00:00:52.990> same<00:00:53.020> distance<00:00:53.680> as<00:00:53.770> it<00:00:53.920> did<00:00:54.040> without

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
goes the same distance as it did without

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.660 
goes the same distance as it did without
the<00:00:54.460> key<00:00:54.670> in<00:00:54.850> if<00:00:55.510> it<00:00:55.690> does<00:00:55.870> you're<00:00:56.110> good<00:00:56.320> to<00:00:56.410> go

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
the key in if it does you're good to go

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.370 
the key in if it does you're good to go
at<00:00:57.670> that<00:00:57.820> point<00:00:57.880> all<00:00:58.600> you<00:00:58.780> have<00:00:58.960> to<00:00:59.110> do<00:00:59.230> is

00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.380 
at that point all you have to do is

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.799 
at that point all you have to do is
tighten<00:00:59.590> the<00:00:59.800> nut<00:00:59.980> onto<00:01:00.490> the<00:01:00.790> shaft<00:01:03.629> type<00:01:04.629> in

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
tighten the nut onto the shaft type in

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.350 
tighten the nut onto the shaft type in
it<00:01:04.900> give<00:01:05.619> it<00:01:05.650> a<00:01:05.799> good<00:01:05.920> tug<00:01:06.220> big<00:01:06.909> crescent

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
it give it a good tug big crescent

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:16.350 
it give it a good tug big crescent
wrench<00:01:07.479> tighten<00:01:08.350> it<00:01:08.409> down<00:01:08.439> tight

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.430 

when<00:01:17.360> you're<00:01:17.510> done<00:01:17.630> tighten<00:01:18.020> it<00:01:18.080> tighten<00:01:18.260> it
