00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.379
 another video of me in this 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:14.670
 video, there is a time unboxing to xbox 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:16.410
 wii xbox when is not he now 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.029
 completely new to the market are to be yes 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.710
 some time but I have me 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.510
 decided now because she was 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.220
 actually relatively cheap on Amazon 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.230
 have the link to it is also again 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.420
 below in the video description and me 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.949
 wanted to go to a next gen console anyway 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.289
 upgrade and that's how it actually works 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.660
 super devoted on the front is 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.670
 the xbox one as well as the controller 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.890
 pictured the same thing again 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.629
 the left side out on the back 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.239
 then you see the surface again 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.040
 the xbox one on a tv and on 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.649
 There are more on the right side 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.480
 Information about xbox by listed 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.770
 when I first open the packaging 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.440
 then we see already below we have the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.059
 xbox ron I'll get that but first 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.100
 look at the upper carton 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.870
 what is there in there everything 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.239
 First, we have a quick guide 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.739
 or a quick start guide like that 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.080
 is on it and then more 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.479
 Information about xbox live gold as well 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.610
 a qr code with me now 30 days 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.020
 can test xbox live gold 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.540
 furthermore there is another one 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.700
 booklet with guarantee conditions and so on 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.530
 further in what I probably eh 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.780
 nobody reads through next I have 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.159
 because here the power cord and the extreme 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.720
 big power adapter 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.520
 But that does not bother me at all 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.350
 is now so big again and not in 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.670
 the xbox were integrated directly 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.590
 then with me one sees the similar for 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.570
 therefore I do not bother then I have 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.759
 here the hdmi cable with which one the xbox 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.040
 yvonne can connect to the tv 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.079
 and then a headset, of course 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.890
 the most important thing and then I looked up 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.079
 no case missing 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.820
 the controller i have the checker 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.649
 ever in some shops 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.329
 tested so to speak but he lies 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.009
 really good hand and then 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.479
 all buttons are really good 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.549
 The whole thing can be in the 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.259
 first impression say there are 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.180
 of course, even the whole battery 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.740
 accessories were covered by old protective films 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.270
 I have the packed us now 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.399
 better to be able to show but sometimes of the 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.659
 Protectors removed yet comes now 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.390
 of course that's it 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.000
 most important in the whole package and that the 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.500
 xbox one in yourself the pack 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.090
 We turn quickly and we look 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.980
 We also had a short time with me 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.930
 before the ps3 super slim the xbox 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.730
 of course, is again significantly larger 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.190
 I like the design so this 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.170
 I really like angular design 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.909
 good and looks on the desk when 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.680

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:26.360
 beautiful from the top you have then this 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.069
 piano lacquer naturally pulls fingers 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.110
 bridge or dust of course then 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.840
 magically, of course, is the way to do it 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.340
