00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
there's a triple answer which I which

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.319 
there's a triple answer which I which
are<00:00:42.809> small<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.230> they<00:00:43.320> tend<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.739> be<00:00:43.920> nice<00:00:44.100> for

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
I think that this particular dish the

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.630 
I think that this particular dish the
premium<00:00:49.079> pork<00:00:49.320> sausages<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.829> are<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.489> best

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
premium pork sausages that are the best

sort of Cumberland sausage a kind of

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.780 
sort of Cumberland sausage a kind of
thing<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.580> don't<00:01:08.729> know<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:10.250> these<00:01:11.250> are<00:01:11.520> like

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
thing you don't know that these are like

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.250 
thing you don't know that these are like
a<00:01:11.820> competent<00:01:12.299> sauce<00:01:12.450> no<00:01:12.630> because<00:01:12.900> they've<00:01:13.080> got

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
a competent sauce no because they've got

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.649 
a competent sauce no because they've got
90<00:01:13.830> percent<00:01:14.220> pork<00:01:14.490> content<00:01:14.970> here<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.299> there's
