well<00:00:05.930> with<00:00:06.079> a<00:00:06.109> total<00:00:06.470> unstick<00:00:06.799> I<00:00:07.039> really<00:00:07.339> love

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:07.519 
well with a total unstick I really love

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:09.010 
well with a total unstick I really love
the<00:00:07.669> way<00:00:07.700> it<00:00:07.910> feels<00:00:08.059> when<00:00:08.360> I'm<00:00:08.420> stickhandling

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:09.020 
the way it feels when I'm stickhandling

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.170 
the way it feels when I'm stickhandling
and<00:00:09.680> I<00:00:09.770> also<00:00:09.860> love<00:00:10.100> the<00:00:10.130> way<00:00:10.250> it<00:00:10.670> feels<00:00:10.850> when<00:00:11.150> I

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:11.180 
and I also love the way it feels when I

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.420 
and I also love the way it feels when I
receive<00:00:11.480> the<00:00:11.510> pass<00:00:11.780> because<00:00:12.740> it's<00:00:13.010> very<00:00:13.130> song

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:13.430 
receive the pass because it's very song

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.910 
receive the pass because it's very song
this<00:00:13.910> is<00:00:14.090> a<00:00:14.120> sick<00:00:14.480> feeling<00:00:14.750> though<00:00:15.050> I<00:00:15.320> love

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920 
this is a sick feeling though I love

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.769 
this is a sick feeling though I love
this<00:00:16.039> doing<00:00:16.369> so<00:00:16.849> the<00:00:16.999> supreme<00:00:17.329> total<00:00:17.660> one

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:17.779 
this doing so the supreme total one

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:19.450 
this doing so the supreme total one
features<00:00:18.169> a<00:00:18.199> technology<00:00:18.800> that<00:00:18.980> we<00:00:19.070> call<00:00:19.279> power

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
features a technology that we call power

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.210 
features a technology that we call power
core<00:00:19.880> 3<00:00:20.210> and<00:00:20.419> it's<00:00:20.539> it's<00:00:20.900> an<00:00:21.019> evolution<00:00:21.710> of<00:00:21.890> the

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
core 3 and it's it's an evolution of the

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.130 
core 3 and it's it's an evolution of the
blade<00:00:22.519> core<00:00:22.820> technology<00:00:23.390> that<00:00:23.539> we<00:00:23.659> use<00:00:23.869> in<00:00:24.050> the

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
blade core technology that we use in the

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.130 
blade core technology that we use in the
195<00:00:24.769> and<00:00:25.329> incorporates<00:00:26.329> two<00:00:26.630> different<00:00:26.960> foam

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
195 and incorporates two different foam

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.929 
195 and incorporates two different foam
materials<00:00:27.679> so<00:00:27.800> it's<00:00:27.949> a<00:00:28.039> dual<00:00:28.249> density<00:00:28.429> blade

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
materials so it's a dual density blade

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.450 
materials so it's a dual density blade
the<00:00:29.749> first<00:00:30.230> material<00:00:30.649> that<00:00:30.800> we<00:00:30.890> use<00:00:31.099> we<00:00:31.310> call

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
the first material that we use we call

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.250 
the first material that we use we call
aarrow<00:00:31.699> foam<00:00:31.999> it's<00:00:32.329> a<00:00:32.450> lightweight<00:00:32.750> low

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
aarrow foam it's a lightweight low

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.170 
aarrow foam it's a lightweight low
density<00:00:33.740> film<00:00:34.010> that's<00:00:34.190> very<00:00:34.490> strong<00:00:34.850> and<00:00:35.120> is

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
density film that's very strong and is

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.940 
density film that's very strong and is
going<00:00:35.390> to<00:00:35.450> prevent<00:00:35.690> blade<00:00:36.080> deflections<00:00:36.680> the

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
going to prevent blade deflections the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.010 
going to prevent blade deflections the
real<00:00:37.190> performance<00:00:37.820> benefit<00:00:38.270> comes<00:00:38.480> from<00:00:38.780> that

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
real performance benefit comes from that

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.530 
real performance benefit comes from that
power<00:00:39.290> core<00:00:39.740> technology<00:00:40.370> blade<00:00:40.640> it's<00:00:41.120> what's

supreme total one stake also features
something<00:01:22.159> that<00:01:22.430> we<00:01:22.550> call<00:01:22.729> the<00:01:22.760> pure<00:01:23.030> shot

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
something that we call the pure shot

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.090 
something that we call the pure shot
blade<00:01:23.300> profile<00:01:24.020> and<00:01:24.200> that<00:01:24.320> technology<00:01:24.710> is

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
blade profile and that technology is

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.820 
blade profile and that technology is
essentially<00:01:26.030> an<00:01:26.120> expansion<00:01:26.840> of<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.500> throat

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
essentially an expansion of the throat

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.590 
essentially an expansion of the throat
area<00:01:28.040> or<00:01:28.370> the<00:01:28.520> transition<00:01:28.850> from<00:01:29.150> the<00:01:29.299> shaft

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
area or the transition from the shaft

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.180 
area or the transition from the shaft
into<00:01:29.900> the<00:01:30.020> blade<00:01:30.320> and<00:01:30.470> what<00:01:30.590> that<00:01:30.740> allows<00:01:31.010> us

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
into the blade and what that allows us

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.250 
into the blade and what that allows us
to<00:01:31.340> do<00:01:31.520> is<00:01:31.729> minimize<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.720> amount<00:01:32.870> of<00:01:33.020> blade

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
to do is minimize the amount of blade

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.899 
to do is minimize the amount of blade
deflection<00:01:33.799> or<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:34.010> opening<00:01:34.430> of<00:01:34.549> the<00:01:34.670> blade

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
deflection or the opening of the blade

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.700 
deflection or the opening of the blade
when<00:01:35.120> making<00:01:35.390> impact<00:01:35.720> with<00:01:35.960> the<00:01:36.020> puck<00:01:36.260> so<00:01:36.560> that

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
when making impact with the puck so that

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.430 
when making impact with the puck so that
when<00:01:37.340> you<00:01:37.490> do<00:01:37.729> shoot<00:01:38.330> the<00:01:38.540> puck<00:01:38.750> it's<00:01:38.990> gonna<00:01:39.170> go

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
when you do shoot the puck it's gonna go

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.660 
when you do shoot the puck it's gonna go
where<00:01:39.650> you<00:01:39.740> want<00:01:39.979> it<00:01:40.070> to<00:01:40.190> go<00:01:40.370> it's<00:01:40.549> about

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
where you want it to go it's about

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.610 
where you want it to go it's about
improving<00:01:41.270> accuracy<00:01:41.630> and<00:01:41.990> making<00:01:42.320> you<00:01:42.440> more
