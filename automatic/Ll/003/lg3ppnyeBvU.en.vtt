00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
anything about it but I finally got a

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.110 
anything about it but I finally got a
chance<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.320> go<00:00:31.470> hands-on<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.279> guess<00:00:32.460> what<00:00:32.669> it

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
chance to go hands-on and guess what it

is<00:00:33.180> more<00:00:33.449> trials<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.199> that<00:00:34.650> is<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.920> very<00:00:35.129> good

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
is more trials and that is a very good

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.549 
is more trials and that is a very good
thing<00:00:38.600> the<00:00:39.600> first<00:00:39.750> thing<00:00:39.900> you'll<00:00:40.110> notice<00:00:40.229> is
