00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.740 
because it has just the essentials on it
that<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.439> use<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:29.250> most<00:00:29.449> starting<00:00:30.449> with<00:00:30.599> the

Letterman<00:04:09.350> skeleton<00:04:10.350> in<00:04:10.500> my<00:04:11.100> opinion<00:04:11.580> is<00:04:11.730> that

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
Letterman skeleton in my opinion is that

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.710 
Letterman skeleton in my opinion is that
the<00:04:12.930> screwdriver<00:04:13.530> if<00:04:13.770> you<00:04:13.860> want<00:04:14.070> to<00:04:14.190> use<00:04:14.400> it

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
the screwdriver if you want to use it

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.760 
the screwdriver if you want to use it
needs<00:04:15.720> to<00:04:16.020> ya<00:04:17.010> be<00:04:17.310> folded<00:04:17.790> like<00:04:17.940> this<00:04:18.000> and<00:04:18.770> even

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
needs to ya be folded like this and even

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.050 
needs to ya be folded like this and even
then<00:04:19.980> you<00:04:20.489> have<00:04:20.640> not<00:04:20.910> a<00:04:20.940> straight<00:04:21.330> line<00:04:21.630> while

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
then you have not a straight line while

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.940 
then you have not a straight line while
you<00:04:24.060> know<00:04:24.210> screwing<00:04:24.810> down<00:04:24.840> or<00:04:25.350> screwing<00:04:25.740> out

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
you know screwing down or screwing out

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.100 
you know screwing down or screwing out
the<00:04:26.040> screw<00:04:26.280> so<00:04:26.850> this<00:04:27.000> is<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.720> handle<00:04:28.020> is<00:04:28.080> a

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
the screw so this is the handle is a

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.770 
the screw so this is the handle is a
little<00:04:28.230> off<00:04:28.560> just<00:04:29.460> because<00:04:29.790> this<00:04:30.030> the<00:04:30.570> shape

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
little off just because this the shape

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.680 
little off just because this the shape
of<00:04:30.960> the<00:04:31.080> handle<00:04:31.350> is<00:04:31.740> so<00:04:31.950> different<00:04:32.540> what<00:04:33.540> is

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
of the handle is so different what is

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.230 
of the handle is so different what is
good<00:04:33.870> though<00:04:34.050> is<00:04:34.290> that<00:04:35.010> you<00:04:35.520> can<00:04:35.730> rotate<00:04:35.850> it

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
good though is that you can rotate it

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.580 
good though is that you can rotate it
and<00:04:36.450> it<00:04:36.870> is<00:04:36.990> 90<00:04:37.350> degree<00:04:37.620> position<00:04:37.800> and<00:04:38.640> you<00:04:39.540> can

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
and it is 90 degree position and you can

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.780 
and it is 90 degree position and you can
turn<00:04:40.590> in<00:04:40.940> very<00:04:41.940> hard<00:04:42.270> on<00:04:42.390> it<00:04:43.520> that<00:04:44.520> is<00:04:44.670> the

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
turn in very hard on it that is the

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.110 
turn in very hard on it that is the
thing<00:04:45.030> I<00:04:45.150> really<00:04:45.390> like<00:04:46.280> if<00:04:47.280> you<00:04:47.460> want<00:04:47.640> to<00:04:47.730> buy<00:04:47.910> a

fiber<00:05:08.970> handle<00:05:09.330> inlays<00:05:10.320> and<00:05:10.350> so<00:05:10.920> on<00:05:11.180> with<00:05:12.180> a

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
fiber handle inlays and so on with a

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.170 
fiber handle inlays and so on with a
plain<00:05:12.540> edge<00:05:12.720> plate<00:05:13.460> so<00:05:14.460> those<00:05:14.760> are<00:05:14.940> the<00:05:15.000> two

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
plain edge plate so those are the two

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.970 
plain edge plate so those are the two

size

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920 
size

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.080 
size
I<00:05:19.950> think<00:05:20.520> the<00:05:20.610> same<00:05:20.850> weight<00:05:21.380> but<00:05:22.850> my<00:05:23.850> opinion

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
I think the same weight but my opinion

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.720 
I think the same weight but my opinion
for<00:05:24.390> an<00:05:24.540> EDC<00:05:24.780> this<00:05:25.470> one<00:05:25.710> is<00:05:25.919> much<00:05:26.280> sturdier

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 
for an EDC this one is much sturdier

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.260 
for an EDC this one is much sturdier
than<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:27.360> CX<00:05:27.690> model<00:05:28.050> and<00:05:28.730> yeah<00:05:29.730> I<00:05:29.790> like<00:05:30.060> it

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270
