already have a photo selected here I'm
using<00:00:50.370> two<00:00:50.670> fingers<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.480> multi-touch

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
using two fingers so it is multi-touch

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.139 
using two fingers so it is multi-touch
you<00:00:52.710> can<00:00:52.890> that's<00:00:53.070> how<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.250> implement<00:00:53.730> how<00:00:54.090> you

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
you can that's how you implement how you

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.660 
you can that's how you implement how you
interact<00:00:54.719> with<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:54.989> picture<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.670> basically

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
interact with this picture and basically

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.279 
interact with this picture and basically
the<00:00:57.000> main<00:00:57.149> gist<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.570> applications<00:00:58.170> at

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
the main gist of this applications at

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.490 
the main gist of this applications at
the<00:00:58.410> bottom<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.949> race<00:00:59.579> on<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.910> race<00:01:00.600> flip<00:01:01.109> save

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
the bottom a race on a race flip save

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.219 
the bottom a race on a race flip save
and<00:01:01.680> undo<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.730> flip<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.629> can<00:01:03.809> flip<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
and undo so flip you can flip the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.700 
and undo so flip you can flip the
applicate<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.860> picture<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.790> have<00:01:06.180> on<00:01:06.600> a

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
applicate the picture that you have on a

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.480 
applicate the picture that you have on a
race<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.159> race<00:01:08.430> obviously<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.799> erase<00:01:10.799> but

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
race so a race obviously you erase but

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.980 
race so a race obviously you erase but
on<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> race<00:01:11.850> does<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.180> opposite<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:12.750> if<00:01:12.869> you're

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
on a race does the opposite so if you're

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.289 
on a race does the opposite so if you're
trying<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.229> basically<00:01:14.130> get<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.760> there<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:14.939> do

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
trying to basically get in there and do

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.039 
trying to basically get in there and do
some<00:01:15.509> fine<00:01:15.750> editing<00:01:16.280> you<00:01:17.280> have<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.580> choice

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
some fine editing you have that choice

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.480 
some fine editing you have that choice
so<00:01:19.049> basically<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.680> application<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.280> just<00:01:20.460> a

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
so basically this application is just a

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.700 
so basically this application is just a
little<00:01:20.640> fun<00:01:20.880> one<00:01:21.090> for<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.990> can<00:01:22.200> mash<00:01:22.439> up

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
little fun one for you you can mash up

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.350 
little fun one for you you can mash up
any<00:01:22.890> pictures<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.490> have<00:01:23.520> with<00:01:23.850> these<00:01:23.970> unique

backgrounds so let's just show you a
quick<00:01:27.270> little<00:01:27.450> demo<00:01:27.540> here<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:28.470> we<00:01:28.590> take<00:01:28.740> this

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
quick little demo here so we take this

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.999 
quick little demo here so we take this
picture<00:01:29.189> with<00:01:29.909> me<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.560> we'll<00:01:31.560> go<00:01:31.710> get<00:01:31.950> the

picture with me and we'll go get the

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.120 
picture with me and we'll go get the
erase<00:01:32.369> tool<00:01:32.400> won't<00:01:33.180> get<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.659> big<00:01:33.900> stuff<00:01:34.259> out

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
of the way first ok then we'll zoom in a

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.889 
of the way first ok then we'll zoom in a
little<00:01:41.100> bit<00:01:41.250> more<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.670> get<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:42.450> other<00:01:42.630> stuff

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
application I think they should lower

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.650 
application I think they should lower
the<00:02:34.800> price<00:02:35.040> maybe<00:02:35.340> two<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.670> then<00:02:35.819> 99<00:02:36.360> cent

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
the price maybe two and then 99 cent

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.150 
the price maybe two and then 99 cent
range<00:02:36.900> just<00:02:37.170> because<00:02:37.410> it's<00:02:37.590> a<00:02:37.650> pretty<00:02:37.890> simple

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
range just because it's a pretty simple

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.690 
range just because it's a pretty simple
idea<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:38.970> it's<00:02:39.540> not<00:02:39.720> as<00:02:39.840> if<00:02:40.069> its<00:02:41.069> total<00:02:41.550> it's

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
idea and it's not as if its total it's

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.940 
idea and it's not as if its total it's
really<00:02:42.300> customizable<00:02:42.810> I<00:02:43.200> really<00:02:43.620> like<00:02:43.769> how

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
really customizable I really like how

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.559 
really customizable I really like how
this<00:02:44.100> was<00:02:44.340> but<00:02:44.549> in<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.819> future<00:02:45.060> I<00:02:45.180> would<00:02:45.330> like

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
this was but in the future I would like

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:46.759 
this was but in the future I would like
if<00:02:45.750> maybe<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.140> could<00:02:46.170> choose<00:02:46.590> the

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
if maybe you could choose the

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.979 
if maybe you could choose the
backgrounds<00:02:47.340> or<00:02:47.459> you<00:02:47.580> could<00:02:47.730> mash<00:02:48.420> multiple

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
backgrounds or you could mash multiple

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.440 
backgrounds or you could mash multiple
pictures<00:02:49.200> together<00:02:49.880> because<00:02:50.880> that<00:02:51.060> way<00:02:51.239> you

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
pictures together because that way you

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.600 
pictures together because that way you
know<00:02:52.019> it<00:02:52.350> would<00:02:52.470> just<00:02:52.560> be<00:02:52.739> much<00:02:53.130> more<00:02:53.310> unique

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
know it would just be much more unique

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.430 
know it would just be much more unique
and<00:02:53.790> much<00:02:53.880> more<00:02:54.060> usable<00:02:54.299> because<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:55.319> could

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
and much more usable because you could

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.690 
and much more usable because you could
put<00:02:55.620> whatever<00:02:55.739> thing<00:02:56.099> you<00:02:56.130> wanted<00:02:56.430> in<00:02:56.549> the
