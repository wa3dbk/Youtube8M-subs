even cooked vegetables they just seem

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.399 
even cooked vegetables they just seem
like<00:01:44.490> they've<00:01:44.640> been<00:01:44.729> crowded<00:01:45.119> out<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.570> I

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
like they've been crowded out and I

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.399 
like they've been crowded out and I
could<00:01:46.649> easily<00:01:46.860> get<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.280> lot<00:01:47.549> more<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:48.200> don't<00:01:49.200> just

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
could easily get a lot more I don't just

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.560 
could easily get a lot more I don't just
more<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:49.950> more<00:01:50.430> food<00:01:50.700> food<00:01:50.939> rather<00:01:51.180> than<00:01:51.299> like

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
more in more food food rather than like

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.410 
more in more food food rather than like
sweets<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.200> just<00:01:52.380> filler<00:01:53.040> case<00:01:53.369> then<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.390> think

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
sweets and just filler case then I think

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.690
