00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:05.460
 and me 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.820
 in the case of an arterial thrombosis the 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.340
 treatment most of the time is 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.770
 surgical because because it is considered 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.420
 as an urgency in the treatment of 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.300
 arterial thrombosis you have to do a 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.279
 arterial exploration and extract the 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.500
 clot through a one treatment 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.440
 surgical in the case of thrombosis 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.400
 venous 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.230
 or deep vein thrombosis there are several 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.420
 ways to treat depending on what 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.000
 classification has the thrombosis in what 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.980
 stadiums and where this is 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.710
 comes to determine clinically and with 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.930
 studies the patient is evaluated if the 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.090
 stadium is not very advanced or is a 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.239
 very early clot can carry 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:57.470
 treatment with anticoagulants nothing 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:00.110
 more if the thrombus is still in place 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.350
 anatomical very close to the heart you have to 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.110
 perform a surgery what type of surgery 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.120
 and then depending as I say of the 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.640
 clinical stage of the patient that in 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.820
 Surgical site can be taken to 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.920
 have an open surgery with 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.510
 clot extraction a scan 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.970
 venous or a thrombectomy can be done 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:26.240
 by endovascular surgery , a 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.450
 catheter to where the thrombus is and it 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.100
 removes the average thrombus from a catheter 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.170
 another one of the treatments that you have to 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.210
 consider in venous thrombosis 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.159
 deep is the placement of a filter 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.280
 of vena cava that has its indications 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.990
 precise 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.549
 so that we place the vein filter 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.100
 digs into patients who are at risk of 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:47.170
 have a pulmonary embolism there are their 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.170
 very clear and precise indications for 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.240
 place a filter and there is the 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.680
 indications for a patient to enter 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.549
 to the surgical treatment of a 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.549
 venous thrombosis
