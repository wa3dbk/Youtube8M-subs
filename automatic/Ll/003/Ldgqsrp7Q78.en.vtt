00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.670 
different apps
scatter<00:05:29.420> across<00:05:29.780> your<00:05:30.080> screen<00:05:30.380> and<00:05:30.560> this

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
scatter across your screen and this

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.680 
scatter across your screen and this
allows<00:05:30.980> you<00:05:31.220> for<00:05:31.430> better<00:05:31.580> multitasking<00:05:32.510> I

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
allows you for better multitasking I

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.870 
allows you for better multitasking I
don't<00:05:33.260> find<00:05:33.440> myself<00:05:33.650> using<00:05:33.830> it<00:05:34.160> that<00:05:34.400> much<00:05:34.700> but

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
don't find myself using it that much but

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.220 
don't find myself using it that much but
it<00:05:35.000> is<00:05:35.120> there<00:05:35.360> for<00:05:35.540> you<00:05:35.630> to<00:05:35.660> use<00:05:35.750> and<00:05:36.080> take

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:36.230 
it is there for you to use and take

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.870 
it is there for you to use and take
advantage<00:05:36.440> again<00:05:36.830> of<00:05:36.860> this<00:05:37.040> big<00:05:37.340> screen<00:05:37.640> size

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
advantage again of this big screen size

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.550 
advantage again of this big screen size
and<00:05:38.180> so<00:05:38.390> this<00:05:38.540> new<00:05:38.630> software<00:05:38.870> boils<00:05:39.350> down<00:05:39.380> to

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
and so this new software boils down to

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.740 
and so this new software boils down to
LG<00:05:40.280> really<00:05:40.580> making<00:05:40.850> everything<00:05:41.090> cleaner<00:05:41.480> and

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
LG really making everything cleaner and

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.180 
LG really making everything cleaner and
tighter<00:05:41.990> getting<00:05:42.410> rid<00:05:42.560> of<00:05:42.620> extra<00:05:42.890> stuff<00:05:43.130> that

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
tighter getting rid of extra stuff that

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.860 
tighter getting rid of extra stuff that
you<00:05:43.430> probably<00:05:43.760> don't<00:05:43.970> need<00:05:44.150> but<00:05:44.630> adding

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
you probably don't need but adding

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.390 
you probably don't need but adding
things<00:05:45.050> like<00:05:45.260> a<00:05:45.290> health<00:05:45.680> app<00:05:45.890> that<00:05:46.100> keep<00:05:46.250> track

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
things like a health app that keep track

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
things like a health app that keep track
of<00:05:46.610> your<00:05:46.670> health<00:05:46.730> information<00:05:47.000> like

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:47.420 
of your health information like

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.300 
of your health information like
