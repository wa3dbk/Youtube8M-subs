and a there's no overlap between these

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.470 
and a there's no overlap between these
two<00:00:31.069> chords<00:00:31.369> that<00:00:31.699> is<00:00:31.880> there<00:00:32.180> aren't<00:00:32.360> any

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
two chords that is there aren't any

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.260 
two chords that is there aren't any
pitches<00:00:32.780> that<00:00:33.230> the<00:00:33.559> two<00:00:33.739> share<00:00:34.160> however<00:00:35.000> you

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
pitches that the two share however you

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.959 
pitches that the two share however you
can<00:00:35.420> find<00:00:35.690> ways<00:00:35.930> to<00:00:35.989> smoothly<00:00:36.590> move<00:00:37.070> from<00:00:37.609> one

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
can find ways to smoothly move from one

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:39.610 
can find ways to smoothly move from one
chord<00:00:38.390> to<00:00:38.629> the<00:00:38.989> next

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
chord to the next

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.369 
chord to the next
I'm<00:00:39.829> going<00:00:40.160> to<00:00:40.250> go<00:00:40.370> from<00:00:40.609> C<00:00:40.820> to<00:00:40.850> D<00:00:41.140> we<00:00:42.140> need<00:00:42.289> to

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
I'm going to go from C to D we need to

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:44.139 
I'm going to go from C to D we need to
keep<00:00:42.559> in<00:00:42.680> consideration<00:00:42.829> that<00:00:43.460> you<00:00:43.670> don't

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
keep in consideration that you don't

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:45.939 
keep in consideration that you don't
have<00:00:44.390> to<00:00:44.629> play<00:00:44.930> your<00:00:45.500> chords<00:00:45.800> in<00:00:45.920> root

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
have to play your chords in root

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:48.459 
have to play your chords in root
position<00:00:46.190> you<00:00:47.090> can<00:00:47.269> use<00:00:47.449> inversions<00:00:48.199> to<00:00:48.320> help

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
position you can use inversions to help

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.279 
position you can use inversions to help
you<00:00:48.649> move<00:00:48.859> smoothly<00:00:49.460> now<00:00:50.420> you<00:00:50.480> can<00:00:50.719> do<00:00:50.870> this<00:00:51.079> by

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
you move smoothly now you can do this by

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.939 
you move smoothly now you can do this by
simply<00:00:51.679> moving<00:00:51.859> from<00:00:52.550> AC<00:00:52.850> to<00:00:53.329> a<00:00:53.780> D<00:00:54.019> chord<00:00:54.320> like

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
simply moving from AC to a D chord like

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:03.689 
simply moving from AC to a D chord like
this<00:00:58.329> and<00:00:59.329> again

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.160 

you<00:01:04.699> may<00:01:04.820> want<00:01:05.030> to<00:01:05.089> use<00:01:05.239> a<00:01:05.300> transitional<00:01:05.900> cord

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
you may want to use a transitional cord

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.530 
you may want to use a transitional cord
in<00:01:06.350> this<00:01:06.710> case<00:01:06.950> I'm<00:01:07.160> going<00:01:07.580> to<00:01:07.760> use<00:01:07.970> a<00:01:08.150> G<00:01:08.330> major

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
in this case I'm going to use a G major

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.440 
in this case I'm going to use a G major
chord<00:01:08.660> if<00:01:09.110> you<00:01:09.800> did<00:01:10.010> that<00:01:10.250> and<00:01:10.520> inserted<00:01:11.150> the<00:01:11.240> G

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
chord if you did that and inserted the G

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.360 
chord if you did that and inserted the G
in<00:01:11.660> between<00:01:12.080> the<00:01:12.200> C<00:01:12.380> and<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:12.590> D<00:01:12.650> it<00:01:13.190> would

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
in between the C and the D it would

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.850 
in between the C and the D it would
sound<00:01:13.520> like<00:01:13.640> this

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:26.270 

again

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.010 

I've<00:01:27.280> embellished<00:01:27.700> slightly<00:01:28.329> but<00:01:28.780> you<00:01:28.869> can

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
I've embellished slightly but you can

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.990 
I've embellished slightly but you can
hear<00:01:29.170> how<00:01:29.350> there<00:01:29.560> are<00:01:29.680> two<00:01:29.920> ways<00:01:30.219> then<00:01:30.520> for<00:01:30.909> me

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
hear how there are two ways then for me

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.940 
hear how there are two ways then for me
to<00:01:31.149> move<00:01:31.270> between<00:01:31.509> those<00:01:31.810> two<00:01:32.020> cords<00:01:32.380> and<00:01:32.530> have

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
to move between those two cords and have

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.940 
to move between those two cords and have
it<00:01:33.100> sound<00:01:33.310> fairly<00:01:34.240> smooth<00:01:34.649> once<00:01:35.649> you<00:01:35.799> have

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
it sound fairly smooth once you have

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.429 
it sound fairly smooth once you have
your<00:01:36.070> basic<00:01:36.360> understanding<00:01:37.360> of<00:01:37.539> reavoice<00:01:38.170> in

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
your basic understanding of reavoice in

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:39.959 
your basic understanding of reavoice in
your<00:01:38.560> pitches<00:01:39.009> in<00:01:39.219> the<00:01:39.429> chords<00:01:39.700> so<00:01:39.789> that<00:01:39.880> you

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:39.969 
your pitches in the chords so that you

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:41.760 
your pitches in the chords so that you
can<00:01:40.119> play<00:01:40.299> inversions<00:01:40.810> you're<00:01:41.320> going<00:01:41.560> to<00:01:41.649> be

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
can play inversions you're going to be

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.279 
can play inversions you're going to be
able<00:01:41.860> to<00:01:42.039> try<00:01:42.579> this<00:01:42.640> out<00:01:42.909> for<00:01:42.970> yourself<00:01:43.450> so<00:01:44.170> if
