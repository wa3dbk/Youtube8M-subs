and showed you what the new growth looks
like<00:01:06.530> when<00:01:06.800> it<00:01:06.890> came<00:01:07.070> in<00:01:07.390> well<00:01:08.390> it's<00:01:08.509> now<00:01:08.690> early

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
like when it came in well it's now early

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.529 
like when it came in well it's now early
August<00:01:09.830> and<00:01:10.070> our<00:01:10.310> hydrangea<00:01:10.820> paniculata<00:01:11.030> is

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:11.539 
August and our hydrangea paniculata is

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:14.650 
August and our hydrangea paniculata is
in<00:01:11.660> full<00:01:11.869> bloom<00:01:11.899> and<00:01:12.470> look<00:01:13.310> at<00:01:13.430> how<00:01:13.610> full<00:01:14.390> the

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
in full bloom and look at how full the

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.870 
in full bloom and look at how full the
shrub<00:01:14.960> is<00:01:15.200> and<00:01:15.560> I<00:01:16.039> guess<00:01:16.220> that's<00:01:16.460> kind<00:01:16.729> of<00:01:16.759> the

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
shrub is and I guess that's kind of the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.320 
shrub is and I guess that's kind of the
point<00:01:17.060> I<00:01:17.270> want<00:01:17.450> to<00:01:17.539> make<00:01:17.750> is<00:01:18.789> don't<00:01:19.789> be<00:01:20.000> afraid

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
point I want to make is don't be afraid

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.180 
point I want to make is don't be afraid
to<00:01:20.570> prune<00:01:20.810> too<00:01:21.050> much<00:01:21.289> on<00:01:21.530> your<00:01:21.679> hydrangea

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
to prune too much on your hydrangea

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.609 
to prune too much on your hydrangea
paniculata<00:01:22.570> because<00:01:23.570> trust<00:01:23.960> me<00:01:24.110> she<00:01:24.259> likes<00:01:24.470> to

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
paniculata because trust me she likes to

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.730 
paniculata because trust me she likes to
grow<00:01:24.940> now<00:01:25.940> we<00:01:26.000> had<00:01:26.270> a<00:01:26.300> very<00:01:26.539> rainy<00:01:26.899> we<00:01:27.590> had<00:01:27.710> a

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
grow now we had a very rainy we had a

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.010 
grow now we had a very rainy we had a
dry<00:01:28.039> start<00:01:28.429> to<00:01:28.550> this<00:01:28.729> season<00:01:28.789> but<00:01:29.690> we<00:01:29.810> followed

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
dry start to this season but we followed

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.510 
dry start to this season but we followed
up<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.320> last<00:01:30.500> three<00:01:30.830> or<00:01:30.920> four<00:01:30.950> weeks<00:01:31.310> with<00:01:31.460> a

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
up the last three or four weeks with a

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.419 
up the last three or four weeks with a
very<00:01:31.700> rainy<00:01:32.000> summer<00:01:32.420> so<00:01:33.410> I<00:01:33.770> am<00:01:34.009> going<00:01:34.190> to<00:01:34.250> say

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429 
very rainy summer so I am going to say

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:35.529 
very rainy summer so I am going to say
that<00:01:34.610> it's<00:01:34.700> probably<00:01:34.970> a<00:01:35.179> little<00:01:35.270> bit<00:01:35.420> more

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
that it's probably a little bit more

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:38.080 
that it's probably a little bit more
growth<00:01:36.020> than<00:01:36.410> usual<00:01:36.860> but<00:01:37.429> you<00:01:37.580> can<00:01:37.729> see<00:01:37.939> the

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
growth than usual but you can see the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.149 
growth than usual but you can see the
flowers<00:01:38.540> are<00:01:38.689> so<00:01:38.869> heavy<00:01:39.170> on<00:01:39.259> the<00:01:39.500> shrub<00:01:39.829> that

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
flowers are so heavy on the shrub that

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.760 
flowers are so heavy on the shrub that
they<00:01:40.670> kind<00:01:40.909> of<00:01:41.000> fell<00:01:41.210> down<00:01:41.540> and<00:01:41.840> what<00:01:42.259> I<00:01:42.290> did<00:01:42.560> is

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
they kind of fell down and what I did is

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.200 
they kind of fell down and what I did is
I<00:01:42.799> actually<00:01:43.040> prune<00:01:43.460> some<00:01:43.700> of<00:01:43.759> the<00:01:43.820> middle<00:01:43.939> ones

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
I actually prune some of the middle ones

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.420 
I actually prune some of the middle ones
off<00:01:44.390> if<00:01:44.600> you<00:01:44.720> take<00:01:44.869> a<00:01:44.900> look<00:01:45.110> here<00:01:45.470> we<00:01:45.650> have<00:01:46.130> some

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
off if you take a look here we have some

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.120
