00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.299
 is thinking about a change of look for 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:08.049
 this summer renata ruiz went to the 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:10.900
 Barber Shop 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:13.770
 and it brings us all the secrets in the 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.770
 next capsule 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.830
 hello girls we are here in vicky with my 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.509
 hairdresser coca that has explained me a 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.850
 little what is it that my coca hair needs 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:36.550
 tell me what do you think we would need 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.920
 to improve this is leafy 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.960
 hair first to know when was the 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.580
 last time to cut your hair 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.350
 Look, I cut it off more or less 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.180
 about five months but I try to 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.670
 tell me how good it was because I know what 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.839
 important to cut the ends but 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.089
 the truth that he has never known which is the 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:53.920
 foundation of this the truth is that for 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:56.140
 a minimum long hair one has to 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.730
 cut every three months what happens when 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.710
 the hair is with the ends split by 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.270
 a long time when a tip is 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.190
 very worn very deteriorated very 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.680
 departure is because there is absence of 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.710
 Keratin Keratin which contains 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.509
 all the amino acids that make us 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.050
 the nutrients go down to the tip 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:15.369
 as pointed well cut means that 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.530
 porta and bone in the keratin that has 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.429
 exact now in this that I lower a bit 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.429
 your look relates 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.090
 what I had previously asked of 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:29.079
 what comes trends regarding 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.240
 You know that in Chile you have put 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:34.299
 much more European in the trends 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.430
 look, there are more girls who dare to 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.500
 cut short short hair 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.780
 chin as I said the mane to me 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.020
 I love it is a very good look for the 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.020
 winter 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.200
 all right 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.789
 because tell us how we have to 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.299
 keep our hair between cut and 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:53.619
 Court massage in the house is a super 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.270
 good question the one that makes me and the 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.689
 The word you used is very important 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.280
 maintenance is very fundamental in the 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.679
 background between cut and cut we are 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.200
 talking about three stretch it at most 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:08.259
 possible four months to do in between 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.970
 massages you have to be clear that when 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.950
 the hairs are very worked with a lot 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.560
 color the ideal is to go to the hairdresser 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.239
 for a stronger massage the products 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.549
 naturals also serve us but about 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.110
 especially for natural hairs ya ya 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.120
 because a very worked hair 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.220
 will hardly react also to 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.410
 a natural product like a massage 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.549
 egg with honey or lack with yogurt 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.280
 etc 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:33.130
 the important thing is that you see it very well 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.579
 the hair mainly then you take the 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.620
 excess water with a towel and you go 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.720
 putting the cream he left here left 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.280
 which is called and massage when massaging 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.079
 chin massage by chin 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.180
 I have become the important protagonist 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.590
 Dry your hair with a towel before you 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.610
 be so and I'm going to be stretching 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.500
 because if not the product you're going to give it 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.230
 it's going to liquefy and it's going to lose its 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.330
 ability to make a dense cream and a 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.620
 Once you did it by all the hair 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.540
 from the root to the tip 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.160
 concentrating mostly on the tip 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.140
 You can also mix it with some 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.880
 droplets of oil and add it to the 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.000
 mix there is no problem at 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.280
 opposite what power after you go to 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.140
 wrap the hair and then if you do not have 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.720
 erase your house you can wrap your hair 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.640
 with the paper to use foil this food 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.100
 which is transparent or with a bag 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.560
 plastic and a towel on top of what 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.209
 you're doing there is simulating the 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.220
 hairdressing massage how many minutes 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:30.050
 we have to leave this mask 20 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.050
 Approximately minutes is very good 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.420
 what do you think seems incredible to me? 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.710
 you do you like my new look and 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.960
