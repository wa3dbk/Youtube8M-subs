out<00:01:43.960> of<00:01:44.110> the<00:01:44.259> wide<00:01:44.470> variety<00:01:44.950> of<00:01:44.979> characters<00:01:45.579> in

out of the wide variety of characters in

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.789 
each game a large majority of the items
are<00:01:48.610> either<00:01:48.759> original<00:01:49.270> or<00:01:49.630> from<00:01:50.350> the<00:01:50.470> Mario

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.060 
are either original or from the Mario
franchise<00:01:50.829> I<00:01:51.640> mean<00:01:52.360> sure<00:01:52.689> Mario's<00:01:53.500> games<00:01:53.799> are

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
franchise I mean sure Mario's games are

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.580 
franchise I mean sure Mario's games are
centered<00:01:54.579> around<00:01:54.640> power-ups<00:01:55.479> but<00:01:55.750> it's<00:01:56.229> a<00:01:56.350> bit

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
centered around power-ups but it's a bit

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.980 
centered around power-ups but it's a bit
surprising<00:01:57.100> to<00:01:57.490> not<00:01:57.670> see<00:01:57.969> more<00:01:58.240> variety<00:01:58.810> in

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
surprising to not see more variety in

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.319 
surprising to not see more variety in
