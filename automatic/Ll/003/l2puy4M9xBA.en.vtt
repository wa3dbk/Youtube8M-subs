00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 before tonight's tonight tonight and a fourth home win I think 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.470
 that it must please the captain and the whole team 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.719
 I listened 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:09.829
 I believe that 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:11.749
 When i was born 

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:15.039
 a few words results lately so much better 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:17.909
 three coastal sites and especially not to catch fire 

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:21.449
 % now it's true that it's important for them at the moment the 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:22.439
 morale of the troops 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.260
 to go on to get on with a good performance even if it's good and 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:27.140
 less good 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.730
 and for that we see everyone arriving as and when 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.130
 the main thing is to bring back something we are at home we take three 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:37.870
 points it serves it's great if we look at this game compared to a whole 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:38.860
 another match 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.050
 we made a full match I was going to always say to the attacked the winger of 8 years 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.239
 there is something that is in the process of the secret is to change tonic 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.110
 the touching elsewhere we start to find a group of players who are 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.100
 for the reader the others 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.250
 likewise the substitutes 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.910
 it's true it's never a pleasure to be from you all the way we see 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.579
 yes but who are there who are besides the players who is the same 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.400
 that by attracting 15 minutes they finally did 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.130
 and that's the strength of a team in a group yesterday that's where we see that 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.150
 we are progressing 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.659
 this is the fifth goal tonight in the national championship slum 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.360
 opening the meter to the 31st pretty much not easy but then we had 

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:20.690
 had nice opportunities and then it's gone 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.800
 define and how does this match 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.380
 well, we've had some bad opportunities elsewhere so his sister 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.660
 because positive 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.240
 because a team is when we know by half-time talking when we scored 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.820
 we took a little bit 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.479
 and after in the second half scoring two goals quickly conceded 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.260
 it's great but then we played a bit too high 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.150
 too easy and% and respect for oneself and the opponent is very 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.940
 important 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.390
 Finally, we must always always respect for his I do not say that we 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.530
 respects more the we had to do 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.800
 but at one point we play a little too easy 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.260
 while we must not confuse play easy to play simple p that we 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.100
 was going to do 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.530
 we will have a match 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.369
 can be delicate certainly the derby to louhans cooks this will be the 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.319
 Friday with 18 a match to an individual since it's a derby he's the 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:15.770
 will still be the 23% before the Christmas holidays so there is still a long time ddd 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.369
 points to take 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:20.199
 ps pity so that's very important to 

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:23.059
 2 to start the meetings 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:25.689
 and for the 100th derby it's never easy 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:28.989
 even in themselves so far not very well ranked percent and it takes 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.159
 especially not take lightly this match 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.900
 % ytd and that starved to death because it is ceasing his' sale with regard to 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.689
 defaults 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:39.349
 it takes just% and takes the good taste of starting percent 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.400
 respectively r what I said earlier and then we'll see 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.609
 Precise blank misseron pro-am 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:47.909
 thank you tolima anyway congratulations to all the team is in the trough of the wave 

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:50.429
 thank you tony vairelles good evening
