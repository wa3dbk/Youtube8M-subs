let's<00:02:38.310> look<00:02:38.730> at<00:02:39.000> another<00:02:39.390> example<00:02:41.540> observe

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
let's look at another example observe

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:51.280 
let's look at another example observe
these<00:02:42.959> numbers<00:02:44.480> 55<00:02:46.370> 65<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:49.519> 75

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
these numbers 55 65 and 75

00:02:51.290 --> 00:03:01.210 
these numbers 55 65 and 75
where<00:02:52.290> does<00:02:53.030> 65<00:02:54.030> lie<00:02:56.269> 65<00:02:57.269> is<00:02:58.190> after<00:02:59.190> 55<00:03:00.030> and

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
where does 65 lie 65 is after 55 and

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.680 
where does 65 lie 65 is after 55 and
before<00:03:02.510> 75<00:03:03.510> that's<00:03:04.470> right<00:03:05.250> now<00:03:06.180> keep

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
before 75 that's right now keep

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.500 
before 75 that's right now keep
practicing
