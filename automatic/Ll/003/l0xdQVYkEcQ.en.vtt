about doflamingo being the

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.890 
about doflamingo being the

that he might be the son of one of the

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.369 
that he might be the son of one of the
Goro<00:02:19.190> say<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.970> five<00:02:20.239> elders<00:02:20.720> like<00:02:20.930> maybe<00:02:21.140> the

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
Goro say the five elders like maybe the

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.470 
Goro say the five elders like maybe the
youngest<00:02:21.799> one<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.190> blonde<00:02:22.370> one<00:02:22.700> maybe<00:02:23.269> he's

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
youngest one the blonde one maybe he's

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.839 
youngest one the blonde one maybe he's
his<00:02:23.659> son<00:02:23.989> that<00:02:24.709> could<00:02:24.890> be<00:02:25.010> interesting<00:02:25.340> and

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
his son that could be interesting and

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.190 
his son that could be interesting and
now<00:02:26.000> she<00:02:26.060> says<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.540> man<00:02:26.720> who<00:02:26.900> will<00:02:27.019> become

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
directly in the heart and I don't think

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.030 
directly in the heart and I don't think
she<00:03:14.720> died<00:03:15.019> though<00:03:15.319> it<00:03:15.470> seems<00:03:15.680> like<00:03:15.859> there's

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
she died though it seems like there's

she died though it seems like there's
mortar<00:03:16.370> maybe<00:03:16.849> I<00:03:16.970> thought<00:03:17.299> there<00:03:17.450> was<00:03:17.569> more<00:03:17.599> to

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780

mortar maybe I thought there was more to
her<00:03:17.959> character<00:03:18.139> than<00:03:18.470> there<00:03:18.590> really<00:03:18.620> was<00:03:19.040> i

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
her character than there really was i

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.920 
her character than there really was i
always<00:03:19.549> thought<00:03:19.730> whether<00:03:20.269> she<00:03:20.540> joined<00:03:20.810> the
