00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
pond in this fashion without doing the

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.130 
pond in this fashion without doing the
pressure<00:01:41.490> washer<00:01:41.730> remember<00:01:42.360> I'm<00:01:42.750> not<00:01:42.900> worried

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
pressure washer remember I'm not worried

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.500 
pressure washer remember I'm not worried
about<00:01:43.200> this<00:01:43.440> algae<00:01:43.800> this<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> good<00:01:44.850> biofilm

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
about this algae this is a good biofilm

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.590 
about this algae this is a good biofilm
and<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:46.680> takes<00:01:47.130> some<00:01:47.310> time<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.580> develop<00:01:47.940> so<00:01:48.120> I

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
and it takes some time to develop so I

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
and it takes some time to develop so I
don't<00:01:48.780> want<00:01:48.900> to<00:01:48.960> hit<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.170> with<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.350> pressure

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
don't want to hit it with a pressure

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.590 
don't want to hit it with a pressure
washer<00:01:49.830> but<00:01:50.490> what<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.640> do<00:01:50.760> want<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.090> do<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.420> get

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
in behind the cracks because that's

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.610 
in behind the cracks because that's
where<00:01:53.280> all<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.490> sludge<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:54.230> back<00:01:55.230> in<00:01:55.470> behind

so kind of what we'll do is we'll go to

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.949 
so kind of what we'll do is we'll go to
the<00:02:41.850> trench<00:02:43.430> like<00:02:44.430> this<00:02:47.360> all<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.630> way<00:02:48.720> across

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
the bottom of the pond and that allows

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.640 
the bottom of the pond and that allows
the<00:02:56.910> dirty<00:02:57.120> water<00:02:57.360> and<00:02:57.480> make<00:02:57.660> itself<00:02:57.989> all<00:02:58.380> the

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
the dirty water and make itself all the

way<00:02:58.739> over<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.130> pump<00:02:59.370> move<00:02:59.790> this<00:02:59.970> guy<00:03:00.120> out

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
way over to the pump move this guy out

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:06.370 
way over to the pump move this guy out
of<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.330> way

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.570 

so<00:03:07.380> now<00:03:07.500> everything<00:03:07.860> that<00:03:08.010> I'm<00:03:08.100> rinsing<00:03:08.250> this

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
so now everything that I'm rinsing this

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.640 
so now everything that I'm rinsing this
way<00:03:08.760> comes<00:03:09.240> into<00:03:09.510> this<00:03:09.630> trench<00:03:10.140> and

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
way comes into this trench and

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.230 
way comes into this trench and
everything<00:03:11.340> that<00:03:11.460> I'm<00:03:11.550> rinsing<00:03:11.700> on<00:03:11.940> this<00:03:12.090> side

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
everything that I'm rinsing on this side

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.210 
everything that I'm rinsing on this side
comes<00:03:12.510> into<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.840> trench<00:03:13.110> and<00:03:13.350> works<00:03:13.830> its<00:03:14.040> way

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
comes into the trench and works its way

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.130 
comes into the trench and works its way
to<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.880> pump<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.270> then<00:03:15.540> we<00:03:15.660> could<00:03:15.810> pump<00:03:16.020> it

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
to the pump and then we could pump it

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.070 
to the pump and then we could pump it
out<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.470> landscape<00:03:17.690> this<00:03:18.690> is<00:03:18.870> great

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
out to the landscape this is great

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.360 
out to the landscape this is great
opportunity<00:03:19.650> when<00:03:19.830> you<00:03:19.860> have<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.160> pond

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
opportunity when you have the pond

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.770 
opportunity when you have the pond
drained<00:03:20.610> down<00:03:20.880> like<00:03:21.060> this<00:03:21.210> you're<00:03:21.480> doing<00:03:21.690> all

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
drained down like this you're doing all

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.240 
drained down like this you're doing all
the<00:03:21.870> rinsing<00:03:22.230> to<00:03:22.680> inspect<00:03:23.070> all<00:03:23.220> the

clean<00:03:33.270> the<00:03:33.450> face<00:03:33.630> of<00:03:33.840> them<00:03:33.930> off<00:03:34.080> right<00:03:34.350> here

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
clean the face of them off right here

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.650 
clean the face of them off right here
when<00:03:35.430> algae<00:03:35.790> starts<00:03:36.060> to<00:03:36.150> grow<00:03:36.300> on<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.510> light

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
when algae starts to grow on the light

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.730 
when algae starts to grow on the light
fixtures<00:03:37.190> it<00:03:38.190> dulls<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.180> does<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.320> impact

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
fixtures it dulls the does the impact

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.530 
fixtures it dulls the does the impact
that<00:03:40.860> it<00:03:40.980> has<00:03:41.100> as<00:03:41.310> well<00:03:41.460> so<00:03:42.120> we'll<00:03:42.210> just<00:03:42.330> check

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
that it has as well so we'll just check

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.580 
that it has as well so we'll just check
on<00:03:42.690> them<00:03:42.840> they're<00:03:42.960> running<00:03:43.200> good<00:03:43.350> if<00:03:43.470> I<00:03:43.560> have

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
on them they're running good if I have

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.960 
on them they're running good if I have
any<00:03:43.800> bulbs<00:03:44.040> that<00:03:44.190> are<00:03:44.280> out<00:03:44.460> right<00:03:44.490> now<00:03:44.700> it's<00:03:44.880> a

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
any bulbs that are out right now it's a

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.410 
any bulbs that are out right now it's a
perfect<00:03:45.270> opportunity<00:03:45.330> to<00:03:45.810> make<00:03:45.990> them<00:03:46.140> change
