00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 and here is the answer to our wonderful 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.950
 interactive riddle like this 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.900
 this stray looks and in fact 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.370
 I am even a little hurt because one 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.139
 from users guessed just but 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.730
 literally one hundred percent meaning he 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.440
 Said it's a stray for iphone 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.170
 which costs around three bucks so she 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.279
 but I would like to tell 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.310
 more detail, that is, what is my chip 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:29.460
 First of all, I bought something recently for 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.410
 iphone so -called fish oh and what 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.700
 I got it well, just a piece of shit this 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.070
 there is no other way to name it 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.590
 some metal pad is attached 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.110
 which is stuck on the phone 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.219
 on top of it is planted on a magnet here 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.260
 this same fish 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.600
 and it is supposedly portable ie it can be 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.160
 take off there up hang where are you still this 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.559
 complete nonsense because that's such 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.750
 implementation that is on plastic cups 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.860
 it is the simplest thing that can be 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.859
 all of our wonderful microscope ready for 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.739
 disc work as follows then here 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.910
 we have such a focal lens 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.559
 if I understand correctly you want to really 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.630
 the focus business as such is not here 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.510
 just have a distance focus on this 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.130
 understand further we have a light source 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.439
 which can be tilted under 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.570
 certain angle and 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.020
 here we have two modes 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:24.259
 lighting that is, I understand that so 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:30.930
 uv lamp visible yes here and 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:32.280
 pretty bright so from the department works 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.150
 as follows that is we just 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:41.520
 simply turn on the light turn on 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:43.799
 we use our camera further just 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.840
 as a camera there is now a little bit 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.500
 when Russ setting the whole thing to you 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.119
 it was visible and further I will show like this 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.930
 But with grief in half, I still set up 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.479
 this whole system 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.340
 what we have here available in front of you 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.950
 cutting edge paramilitary 2 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.110
 the very beginning where it is most difficult 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.540
 pierce here we can use 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.520
 focus on something like this 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.719
 either there is such a thing if 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.970
 let's say you want fiction 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.310
 focus on the background 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.820
 that is, this case is generally quite convenient 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.580
 well and then just move the knife and 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.860
 see how this whole thing changes when 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.070
 we can already push ppm you gave 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.390
 just recently literally doing it 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.480
 full mirror did not work because 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.130
 the fact that I'm just too lazy to do it 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.620
 but here as you can see there are 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.190
 there are no rough bits and the knife turned out 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.260
 pretty sharp how he was basically 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.340
 initially but now he just has hair 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.800
 shaves with a rebound as we never shaved 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.510
 I did not try to whip hair, but in general 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.020
 also experience quite positive well and 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.400
 the tip is wonderful our such canoe on 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.080
 actually quite a useful thing i 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.300
 I think because anyway you 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.780
 you can always evaluate the result of your 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.570
 sharpening let's reason for that matter 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:03.680
 look at the cutting edge with excitement 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:05.150
 flipper she is not an example we are thinner yes 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.160
 by the way what you see now is this 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.090
 trouble focusing and don't eat with 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.709
 just by clicking on the screen everything is also a 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.000
 light source can be defined 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.080
 way to configure ie you 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.209
 can tilt it in one way or another 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.570
 but the side is also necessary periodically 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:24.830
 focus the phone because it 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:27.050
 a little bit lost what's super not there 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.519
 this is a molecule you certainly will not see but 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.440
 the increase is quite such a decent 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.940
 for us to click on in which you this 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.930
 it is interesting to look only at the cutting 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.790
 the edge can be very useful so 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.150
 A short video was useful to wear. 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.250
 I wonder if we need someone 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.799
 Immediately to preempt all questions look for 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.470
 just over there i don't know 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.989
 iphone mike excavation and so on i mean 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.660
 it's all on aliexpress thousands of them there 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.519
 streamline sorts those by price and 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.190
 Further, in fact, choose 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:01.780
 all right now thanks now exactly 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.780
 good luck and now for now
