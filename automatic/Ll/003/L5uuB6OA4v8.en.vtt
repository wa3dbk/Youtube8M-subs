00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 hello everyone and welcome to the kitchen 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.700
 del norte 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.250
 today I want to show you how 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.309
 cook a delicious and healthy product and 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.080
 it is yogurt to cook it at home about 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.870
 yogurt i can tell a lot a lot 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.970
 hours but today just concentrate 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.279
 on the recipe to cook 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.160
 delicious and healthy yogurt of course to us 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.500
 will need milk sticks or bacteria 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.250
 which we will multiply multiply 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.920
 to breed 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.260
 as well as yogurt maker for cooking 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.630
 my yogurt I need a half 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.910
 a liter of milk why half a liter of milk 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.579
 because in my yogurt maker 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.320
 only half a liter fit in here 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.540
 all of these jars by month only 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.820
 one and a half liters to start I boil 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.270
 milk this process is not in principle 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.879
 but if required in the milk are 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.250
 bad bacteria will be more correct 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.440
 boil milk to kill them that is 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.360
 we create a clean environment in which we 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.239
 we will breed good and useful 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.359
 bacteria is exactly what the great scientist did 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.750
 Ilya of swordsmen after milk 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.360
 boiled it must be cooled i'm chilling 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.220
 it in cold water I do it in order 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.159
 just not to spend much 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.970
 of time and as you see i add 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.259
 pieces of ice 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.270
 they will all melt and the milk will cool faster 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.909
 cool the milk to cold 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.640
 absolutely do not need us need to milk 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.090
 was roughly body temperature namely 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.240
 36 30 degrees if the milk is hot 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.909
 and then the bacteria are usually in hot water 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.820
 and die at high temperatures 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.740
 so we will not kill them who do 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.860
 milk is just warm now from my 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.509
 warm milk I will remove the froth it for those 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.579
 who doesn't love kefir with lumps 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.659
 in fact , this is also a step 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:54.540
 optional but yogurt will turn out more 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:57.030
 pleasant consistency and now we will 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.200
 give birth to new sense bacteria 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.149
 we will multiply them 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.640
 but what idea did you get at first they 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.399
 breed there in milk and then anir 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.570
 breeds inside us again as 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.759
 Ilya spoke swordsmen 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.400
 no matter how many bad bacteria we have 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.330
 it is important how many good things are 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.460
 the more we eat yogurt 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.470
 the more we eat kefir and others 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.320
 products that contain these 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.750
 good bacteria the better for us for 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.210
 our health, I add different 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.970
 bacteria after i added these 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.710
 bacteria i'm stirring yogurt well 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.720
 almost ready to pour it by 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.720
 jars and I want to share with you 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.500
 useful tips quality yogurt and 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.440
 taste it 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.250
 depends on milk from bacteria which you 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.340
 are using 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:46.320
 on the temperature and how long this yogurt 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.820
 is warm so play around 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.270
 experiment put on more 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.670
 time 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.010
 try other bacteria try 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.550
 other milk and in the end you 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.500
 achieve what you will do 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.900
 delicious good yogurt is exactly that yogurt 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.850
 which is right for you for myself I 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.210
 found the optimal time is eight hours 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.370
 to make yogurt you can 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.920
 add hour remove hour add pair 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.110
 hours as I said experiment 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.640
 dare and i'm sure that you will succeed 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.090
 delicious yogurt 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:22.209
 nine hours have passed my yogurt is ready he 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.459
 It turned out just the way I wanted it 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.560
 make i use certain 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.510
 bacteria use certain milk and 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.880
 in principle, after several 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.340
 of experiments i have achieved so that 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.100
 I got exactly the yogurt that 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.230
 I like what you want and pleasant
