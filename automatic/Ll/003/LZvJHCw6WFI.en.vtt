minecraft<00:00:10.679> at<00:00:10.830> yar<00:00:11.070> which<00:00:11.340> we<00:00:11.610> learnt<00:00:11.849> how<00:00:11.940> to

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
minecraft at yar which we learnt how to

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:12.650 
minecraft at yar which we learnt how to
do<00:00:12.179> last<00:00:12.389> time

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
do last time

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.340 
do last time
in<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:14.240> shell<00:00:15.240> script<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.660> open<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:15.990> with<00:00:16.139> more

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
in a shell script to open it with more

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.689 
in a shell script to open it with more
memory<00:00:16.560> so<00:00:16.980> what<00:00:17.190> we're<00:00:17.279> going<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.430> do<00:00:17.580> is

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
memory so what we're going to do is

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.820 
memory so what we're going to do is
we're<00:00:17.820> going<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.000> make<00:00:18.119> this<00:00:18.300> document<00:00:18.840> I'm

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
we're going to make this document I'm

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:20.890 
we're going to make this document I'm
going<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.039> rename<00:00:20.340> it

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
going to rename it

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.070 
going to rename it
minecraft<00:00:21.900> dot<00:00:22.590> s<00:00:22.980> H<00:00:23.340> which<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.060> an<00:00:24.240> executable

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
minecraft dot s H which is an executable

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.589 
minecraft dot s H which is an executable
shell<00:00:25.619> script

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
shell script

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.990 
shell script
so<00:00:27.599> what<00:00:27.750> we<00:00:27.869> want<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.410> do<00:00:28.529> next<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:29.130> terminal

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
so what we want to do next is terminal

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.200 
so what we want to do next is terminal
which<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:31.019> just<00:00:31.199> use<00:00:31.320> ctrl<00:00:31.650> alt<00:00:31.830> T<00:00:31.859> for<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.309> and

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
which I just use ctrl alt T for that and

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.090 
which I just use ctrl alt T for that and
we're<00:00:33.329> going<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.510> go<00:00:34.100> sudo<00:00:35.100> apt<00:00:36.860> -<00:00:37.860> get<00:00:38.450> install

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
we're going to go sudo apt - get install

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.830 
we're going to go sudo apt - get install
VI<00:00:41.100> M<00:00:41.370> which<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.579> basically<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.180> in<00:00:44.840> terminal

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
won't say I will are able to install it

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.889 
won't say I will are able to install it
just<00:00:49.590> when<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.700> do<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.940> just<00:00:51.000> install<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.449> or

so<00:02:02.130> it's<00:02:02.310> equal<00:02:02.909> then<00:02:03.840> we're<00:02:04.049> gonna<00:02:04.170> do<00:02:04.380> -<00:02:04.829> jar

so it's equal then we're gonna do - jar

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.850 
so it's equal then we're gonna do - jar
then<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.590> name<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:09.200> file<00:02:10.200> member<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.679> keep

then the name of the file member to keep

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.140 
then the name of the file member to keep
these<00:02:11.039> two<00:02:11.160> in<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.340> same<00:02:11.520> place<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.970> knows

these two in the same place so it knows

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.190 
these two in the same place so it knows
where<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.450> is

squid<00:03:43.440> screen<00:03:44.340> long<00:03:44.519> like<00:03:44.730> mad<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:45.329> then

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
squid screen long like mad and then

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:52.340 
squid screen long like mad and then
single-player<00:03:50.420> as<00:03:51.420> you<00:03:51.630> can<00:03:51.720> see<00:03:51.840> it<00:03:51.989> loads<00:03:52.200> in

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
single-player as you can see it loads in

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.630 
single-player as you can see it loads in
the<00:03:52.410> chunks<00:03:52.709> a<00:03:52.799> lot<00:03:52.920> faster<00:03:53.250> we<00:03:53.340> don't<00:03:53.489> get

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
the chunks a lot faster we don't get

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.539 
the chunks a lot faster we don't get
that<00:03:53.700> same<00:03:53.970> like<00:03:54.239> when<00:03:54.600> we<00:03:54.780> start<00:03:55.049> off<00:03:55.549> outside

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
that same like when we start off outside

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.000 
that same like when we start off outside
and<00:03:57.060> what<00:03:57.690> we<00:03:57.780> get<00:03:57.930> in<00:03:58.019> our<00:03:58.140> yes<00:03:58.620> we<00:03:58.769> get<00:03:58.890> in

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
and what we get in our yes we get in

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.580 
and what we get in our yes we get in
already<00:03:59.340> more<00:04:00.049> before<00:04:01.049> we<00:04:01.109> open<00:04:01.350> this<00:04:01.410> window

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
already more before we open this window

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.650 
already more before we open this window
up<00:04:01.829> you<00:04:02.130> can<00:04:02.280> see<00:04:02.400> going<00:04:02.609> up<00:04:02.700> a<00:04:02.819> lot<00:04:02.940> higher<00:04:03.060> but

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
up you can see going up a lot higher but

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.970 
up you can see going up a lot higher but
it<00:04:03.780> also<00:04:03.900> gives<00:04:04.170> it<00:04:04.230> a<00:04:04.319> lot<00:04:04.440> more<00:04:04.500> memory<00:04:04.890> of

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
it also gives it a lot more memory of

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.920 
it also gives it a lot more memory of
their<00:04:05.130> look<00:04:05.340> you're<00:04:06.239> generally<00:04:06.569> using<00:04:06.810> about

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
their look you're generally using about

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.960 
their look you're generally using about
two<00:04:07.650> to<00:04:07.859> three<00:04:07.890> hundred<00:04:08.069> megabytes<00:04:08.670> out<00:04:08.880> of

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
two to three hundred megabytes out of

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.789 
two to three hundred megabytes out of
you<00:04:09.150> a<00:04:09.329> thousand<00:04:09.900> so<00:04:10.139> you<00:04:10.170> can<00:04:10.380> use<00:04:10.530> a<00:04:10.560> lot<00:04:10.769> more

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
you a thousand so you can use a lot more

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.319 
you a thousand so you can use a lot more
attacks<00:04:11.220> you<00:04:11.370> get<00:04:11.519> a<00:04:11.549> better<00:04:11.700> performance<00:04:11.880> out

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
attacks you get a better performance out

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.870 
attacks you get a better performance out
of<00:04:12.359> it<00:04:12.600> so<00:04:13.139> yeah<00:04:13.319> this<00:04:14.040> has<00:04:14.160> been<00:04:14.190> my<00:04:14.430> tutorial
