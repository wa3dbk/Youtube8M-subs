00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.799
 hello today I am with olivia 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.990
 self-confidence coach of all 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.000
 point coaches fr then if you have a 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.559
 message difficult enough to pass 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.030
 whether in the professional environment 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.160
 or staff 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.380
 olivia will explain how to do 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.619
 to better communicate look well 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.390
 to communicate better via several 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.900
 small tools that it is possible 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.750
 to use which one has to prepare a 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.809
 little before that is good first 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.630
 have a good breathing 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.809
 then there is a little tool called 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.239
 verbal judo is having an attitude 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.079
 positive questions and 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:49.530
 constructive to defuse a 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.829
 conversation that is a little tense a little 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.899
 aggressive and also to try to better 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.030
 understand what the other person wants and 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.449
 to reach an agreement 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.640
 for example if someone shows or says 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.439
 that he is not happy with a job that 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.909
 you did or an attitude that 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.130
 you had or something that 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.030
 you said in meeting 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:16.080
 you seek to understand for for 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:19.430
 defuse a potential conflict and you 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.930
 ask questions like this 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.729
 I do not understand very well is what you 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.710
 could explain to me how you would have 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.610
 make my place 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.610
 What could I do take 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.130
 to improve next time and I will 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.670
 it refers what you think 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.579
 this is really an attitude of 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:41.700
 open questions to go to the 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.720
 building an idea together 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.189
 improvements 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.970
 there is something else that is 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:51.720
 important in a difficult situation 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.580
 with someone to defuse it's up to 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.070
 to say that 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.980
 what we feel we need 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.810
 clarifications where we say we are in 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.560
 anger that lets out his anger 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:08.640
 without animosity but just say his 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.270
 feeling and suddenly that but it gives a 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.280
 radar to another who says he's okay 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.530
 she is angry 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.090
 ok I take note and that's it 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.300
 maybe lets go down a notch 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.370
 if there is a tension so that's express 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:28.260
 his felt his needs another 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:30.510
 little trick also to use in 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.080
 situation where it is a little tense 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:37.170
 it is to avoid the burst of questions 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.810
 to ask lots of questions 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.209
 that suddenly the other are invaded by 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.810
 questions and we do not have time to 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:49.709
 know how to react and that can 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:53.010
 the cluttered the panic so went 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.600
 question by question and leave 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.400
 time between questions another 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.380
 little thing too that is important 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.200
 when we talk with someone that this 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:06.660
 either in a tense situation lupa or 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.050
 in a group or two it is to mark 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.930
 breaks 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:13.980
 especially when we want to insist on a 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.810
 point not to be afraid of voids this 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.560
 which is very important also that it is 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.090
 such two or group is 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.850
 when we call the contact 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:28.500
 it's good to look at your interlocutor or 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:32.010
 his interlocutors always keep a 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.320
 link with in the look and not look 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.500
 down or up or next 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.760
 but really showed that we are in the 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.489
 conversation that we pay attention 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.739
 to the other that we listen for what he 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.900
 tells us and we are focused 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.879
 on him when someone communicates to him 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.220
 thing that can be good too when 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:55.370
 a situation was a little tense 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.739
 it's about using humor to make 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.920
 humor on the subject we are trying 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.900
 to evoke or find a little trick in 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.440
 parallel for to relax a little 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:10.519
 the atmosphere is a bit ironic 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.079
 or where I just laugh about something 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.450
 which is just happening at 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:17.269
 side for example what is important 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.669
 also it is to formulate the things of 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.709
 positive way to avoid negations 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.840
 in the sentences do not like 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.770
 do not forget but rather find a 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:32.000
 verb that will prevent us from using the 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:34.370
 negation like thinking about think to finish 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.449
 this folder where think to tell me when you 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:41.449
 will be ready for example what is good 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:46.910
 as a tool also in situations a 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:49.250
 uncomplicated or difficult in group or 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.710
 to two or in a team or even in 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:55.630
 privacy is what's called 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:58.550
 the meta communication is to speak 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.590
 about what happened but by doing 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:04.970
 abstraction of the content in fact of this 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:07.550
 that we could feel what we experienced 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.740
 that it makes us come as idea like 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.710
 impression as sensation one can 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.240
 talk about these emotions but it allows 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.910
 in fact to also take the distance 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.880
 about a subject and to communicate 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:24.590
 on a different plane than just the content 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:28.220
 is to actually stay on the detail 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:30.080
 of a job and sometimes it also allows 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.539
 like that to unlock situations 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.400
 since we exchange emotions and 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:36.110
 feelings about a subject or a 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.690
 event happened is another 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:42.289
 small tool that is very important 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:45.770
 important is to have an attitude a 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:47.440
 open position an open posture in 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.260
 facing each other and in front of others 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.630
 that is to say 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:56.820
 do not cross arms like that yes 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:06:00.510
 to cross your legs is to be 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.950
 open and then be not too forward 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.200
 because if not the other one for 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.940
 the impression that it has been invaded 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:11.370
 backwards because that is to say that one is 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:13.680
 too loose so be standing straight and 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.390
 and then you feel well open in 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.850
 face each other have are still 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:19.830
 open ie a little with his 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:24.110
 arm no more without it either 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:27.060
 but here is an open attitude and 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:29.400
 right or what are you here with all these 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:32.160
 small tools you can take 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:35.370
 some or all and integrate them 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:38.100
 gradually to your daily 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:40.560
 whether at work or in your life 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.540
 private with your friends with your family 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.690
 you can use them 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:48.570
 little by little see if it works or not 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:50.640
 if it does not work, see why that 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:54.930
 dysfunction compared to what I have 

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:56.970
 could you explain yourself at the beginning and see 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:59.610
 if there is another way to put in 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.960
 place or so take a tool that you 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.560
 seems easier to use 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:07.370
 but the idea is to integrate them 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.370
 gradually to your daily
