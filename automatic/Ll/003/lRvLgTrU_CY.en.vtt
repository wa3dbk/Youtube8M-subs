00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.080 
right this is really good I don't have
to<00:01:43.560> wait<00:01:43.680> another<00:01:43.770> year<00:01:43.920> for<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.670> they

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
to wait another year for this and they

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.020 
to wait another year for this and they
are<00:01:45.180> strangely<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.600> leak<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.500> still<00:01:46.920> early<00:01:47.820> days

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
are strangely I leak so still early days

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.020 
are strangely I leak so still early days
yet<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.689> think<00:01:48.810> it's<00:01:48.899> gonna<00:01:49.020> very<00:01:49.229> hard<00:01:49.380> to

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
yet and I think it's gonna very hard to

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.950 
yet and I think it's gonna very hard to
thermometers<00:01:51.030> in<00:01:51.119> his<00:01:51.210> mouth<00:01:51.390> but<00:01:51.720> we're<00:01:51.869> not

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
thermometers in his mouth but we're not

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.929 
thermometers in his mouth but we're not
quite<00:01:52.079> sure<00:01:52.200> yeah<00:01:53.130> it's<00:01:53.159> not<00:01:53.399> three<00:01:53.670> or<00:01:53.700> four

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
quite sure yeah it's not three or four

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.609 
quite sure yeah it's not three or four
we<00:01:54.600> have<00:01:54.720> three<00:01:54.930> or<00:01:55.020> four<00:01:55.140> games<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
we have three or four games of the

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.499 
we have three or four games of the
season<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.070> far<00:01:56.100> as<00:01:56.369> it's<00:01:56.549> hot<00:01:56.700> it's<00:01:57.060> hard<00:01:57.299> to

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
season so far as it's hot it's hard to

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.200 
season so far as it's hot it's hard to
see<00:01:57.689> at<00:01:58.469> this<00:01:58.770> stage<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.280> knock-on<00:01:59.579> effect<00:01:59.939> of

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
see at this stage the knock-on effect of

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.289 
see at this stage the knock-on effect of
the<00:02:00.659> Indian<00:02:00.960> Super<00:02:01.290> League<00:02:01.320> but<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.649> guess

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
the Indian Super League but I guess

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.690 
the Indian Super League but I guess
notable<00:02:03.299> comparisons<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.310> partly<00:02:05.310> feels<00:02:05.490> bad

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
notable comparisons and partly feels bad

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.980 
notable comparisons and partly feels bad
that<00:02:05.729> we're<00:02:06.000> always<00:02:06.119> looking<00:02:06.420> out<00:02:06.630> for<00:02:06.689> big
