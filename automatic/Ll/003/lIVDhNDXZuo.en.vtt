00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.550 

basically<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:53.060> light-up<00:01:53.270> eyes<00:01:53.540> is<00:01:54.200> just<00:01:54.470> a

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
basically the light-up eyes is just a

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.670 
basically the light-up eyes is just a
little<00:01:54.800> switch<00:01:55.130> right<00:01:55.160> there<00:01:55.430> I<00:01:56.560> don't<00:01:57.560> know

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
little switch right there I don't know

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.859 
little switch right there I don't know
if<00:01:57.740> you<00:01:57.890> can<00:01:58.040> get<00:01:58.190> the<00:01:58.369> bottom<00:01:58.729> to<00:01:59.540> see<00:01:59.720> what

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
if you can get the bottom to see what

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.240 
if you can get the bottom to see what
number<00:02:00.229> it<00:02:00.350> is<00:02:00.470> I<00:02:00.770> think<00:02:00.860> it's<00:02:01.100> a<00:02:01.570> 92<00:02:02.570> of<00:02:03.410> 200

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
number it is I think it's a 92 of 200

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.710 
number it is I think it's a 92 of 200
and<00:02:05.240> they<00:02:05.360> limited<00:02:05.660> it<00:02:05.810> to<00:02:05.869> only<00:02:06.229> 200

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.140 

it's<00:02:10.650> still<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.920> nice<00:02:11.070> piece<00:02:11.130> it's<00:02:11.670> not<00:02:11.760> it's

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
it's still a nice piece it's not it's

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.610 
it's still a nice piece it's not it's
nowhere<00:02:12.330> near<00:02:12.510> as<00:02:12.660> good<00:02:12.780> as<00:02:12.930> my<00:02:13.200> other<00:02:13.350> Shin

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
nowhere near as good as my other Shin

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.230 
nowhere near as good as my other Shin
Akuma<00:02:14.120> by<00:02:15.120> Jerry<00:02:15.480> but<00:02:15.810> it's<00:02:16.500> nice<00:02:16.710> I<00:02:17.090> like<00:02:18.090> the
