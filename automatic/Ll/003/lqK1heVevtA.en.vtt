that will swim at the same speed as a

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.979 
that will swim at the same speed as a
epic<00:03:17.370> flying<00:03:17.670> mount<00:03:17.940> but<00:03:18.630> I'm<00:03:18.780> predicting

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
epic flying mount but I'm predicting

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.199 
epic flying mount but I'm predicting
that<00:03:19.500> most<00:03:19.859> player<00:03:20.130> will<00:03:20.340> choose<00:03:20.370> mount<00:03:20.970> hyjal

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
that most player will choose mount hyjal

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.150 
that most player will choose mount hyjal
because<00:03:21.720> that's<00:03:21.900> slightly<00:03:22.440> faster<00:03:23.040> for

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
because that's slightly faster for

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.699 
because that's slightly faster for
leveling<00:03:23.579> and<00:03:23.760> easier<00:03:24.480> to<00:03:24.630> get<00:03:24.810> into<00:03:24.959> but

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
leveling and easier to get into but

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.259 
leveling and easier to get into but
that'd<00:03:25.920> probably<00:03:26.069> be<00:03:26.400> a<00:03:26.430> good<00:03:26.670> reason<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.060> go

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
that'd probably be a good reason to go

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.059 
that'd probably be a good reason to go
to<00:03:27.329> VII<00:03:27.630> because<00:03:28.200> there'll<00:03:28.440> be<00:03:28.470> less<00:03:28.709> players

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
to VII because there'll be less players

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.759 
to VII because there'll be less players
there<00:03:29.569> if<00:03:30.569> you<00:03:30.750> don't<00:03:31.019> mind<00:03:31.260> spending<00:03:31.500> the
