rock hat our bow gaming keyboard here
now<00:00:07.259> there's<00:00:07.500> quite<00:00:07.680> a<00:00:07.830> few<00:00:08.010> differences<00:00:08.550> that

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
now there's quite a few differences that

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.459 
now there's quite a few differences that
set<00:00:08.910> this<00:00:09.030> keyboard<00:00:09.269> out<00:00:09.570> amongst<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.440> the

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
set this keyboard out amongst the the

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.950 
set this keyboard out amongst the the
other<00:00:10.920> keyboards<00:00:11.370> on<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.550> market<00:00:11.960> mainly

other keyboards on the market mainly
when<00:00:13.500> you<00:00:13.620> see<00:00:14.099> it<00:00:14.280> you're<00:00:14.460> going<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.670> notice

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
when you see it you're going to notice

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.660 
when you see it you're going to notice
is<00:00:15.089> you're<00:00:15.450> much<00:00:15.599> smaller<00:00:16.020> than<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.670> standard

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
is you're much smaller than a standard

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.689 
is you're much smaller than a standard
keyboard<00:00:18.140> and<00:00:19.140> we'll<00:00:19.260> come<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.590> why<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.670> a

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
keyboard and we'll come to why that is a

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.519 
keyboard and we'll come to why that is a
little<00:00:21.090> bit<00:00:21.180> later<00:00:21.359> on<00:00:21.480> you've<00:00:22.140> also<00:00:22.289> got

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
little bit later on you've also got

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.740 
little bit later on you've also got
macro<00:00:22.949> keys<00:00:23.160> on<00:00:23.400> there<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:23.820> by<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.119> thumb<00:00:24.449> so

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
macro keys on there and by the thumb so

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.599 
macro keys on there and by the thumb so
you<00:00:24.779> can<00:00:25.140> use<00:00:25.680> them<00:00:25.890> quite<00:00:26.099> easily<00:00:26.220> with

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
you can use them quite easily with

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.519 
you can use them quite easily with
yourself<00:00:27.240> using<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.960> spacebar<00:00:28.199> in

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
yourself using the spacebar in

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.290 
yourself using the spacebar in

which<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.360> really<00:00:36.750> cool<00:00:36.930> which<00:00:37.260> we'll<00:00:37.469> get

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
which is really cool which we'll get

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.680 
which is really cool which we'll get
into<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.800> little<00:00:37.890> bit<00:00:38.010> later<00:00:38.100> on<00:00:38.399> as<00:00:38.520> well<00:00:38.690> and

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
you've also got macro managing so you

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.240 
you've also got macro managing so you
can<00:00:42.510> set<00:00:42.690> up<00:00:42.719> macros<00:00:43.200> for<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.590> keyboard<00:00:44.010> and

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
deactivation there's a whole host of

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.360 
deactivation there's a whole host of
things<00:00:51.989> which<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.440> keyboard<00:00:52.620> does<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.280> it

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
really cool so without further ado as

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.260 
really cool so without further ado as
I'm<00:00:58.440> quite<00:00:58.710> excited<00:00:58.800> let's<00:00:59.640> just<00:00:59.820> open<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.149> up

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
I'm quite excited let's just open it up

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:08.719 
I'm quite excited let's just open it up
and<00:01:00.600> have<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.410> little<00:01:01.590> look<00:01:01.739> at<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:07.310> and<00:01:08.310> here<00:01:08.640> it

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
and have a little look at it and here it

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.840 
and have a little look at it and here it
is<00:01:08.960> now<00:01:09.960> as<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.560> can<00:01:10.680> see<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.520> lot

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
is now as you can see it is a lot

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.270 
is now as you can see it is a lot
smaller<00:01:12.000> than<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.540> standard<00:01:12.720> keyboard<00:01:13.229> now<00:01:13.950> the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
smaller than a standard keyboard now the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.410 
smaller than a standard keyboard now the
way<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.610> they've<00:01:14.760> done<00:01:14.939> this<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.299> they've

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
way that they've done this is they've

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.670 
way that they've done this is they've
actually<00:01:15.600> integrated<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.259> directional

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
actually integrated the directional

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.499 
actually integrated the directional
arrow<00:01:16.830> keys<00:01:17.100> into<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.670> number<00:01:18.000> pad<00:01:18.180> here<00:01:18.420> as

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
arrow keys into the number pad here as

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.420 
arrow keys into the number pad here as
well<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:19.380> usually<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.860> keyboard<00:01:20.189> will<00:01:20.280> come

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
well so usually the keyboard will come

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.370 
well so usually the keyboard will come
out<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.670> probably<00:01:20.909> about<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.630> length<00:01:22.020> here

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
out to probably about this length here

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.760 
out to probably about this length here
giving<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.460> good<00:01:23.729> few<00:01:23.970> extra<00:01:24.240> inches<00:01:24.770> by

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
giving it a good few extra inches by

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.380 
giving it a good few extra inches by
instead<00:01:26.189> they've<00:01:26.640> managed<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.909> convince<00:01:27.240> it

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
instead they've managed to convince it

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.660 
instead they've managed to convince it
down<00:01:27.600> now<00:01:28.320> how<00:01:28.979> he's<00:01:29.159> supposed<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.430> use<00:01:29.579> a

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
down now how he's supposed to use a

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.580 
down now how he's supposed to use a
directional<00:01:30.060> arrow<00:01:30.180> keys<00:01:30.509> if<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.930> using<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
directional arrow keys if you using the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.490 
directional arrow keys if you using the
number<00:01:31.890> pad<00:01:31.920> well<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.420> top<00:01:33.659> corner<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.290> the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
number pad well in the top corner of the

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.810 
number pad well in the top corner of the
keyboard<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.979> can<00:01:35.040> see<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.340> little<00:01:35.640> button

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
my land table for example then I've

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.620

pad space whereas if this was a

which<00:04:15.470> comes<00:04:15.769> with<00:04:16.220> the<00:04:16.700> keyboard<00:04:16.970> itself<00:04:17.299> so

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
which comes with the keyboard itself so

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:18.909 
which comes with the keyboard itself so
