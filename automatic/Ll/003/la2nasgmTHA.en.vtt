swinging on geo hat and other bomb

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.430 
swinging on geo hat and other bomb
hackers<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.039> stuff<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.670> hacked<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.210> ps3

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
hackers and stuff that a hacked the ps3

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.310 
hackers and stuff that a hacked the ps3
um<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:53.160> few<00:00:53.850> years<00:00:54.210> ago<00:00:54.449> but<00:00:54.750> few<00:00:54.989> years<00:00:55.110> ago<00:00:55.199> I

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
um a few years ago but few years ago I

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.810 
um a few years ago but few years ago I
mean<00:00:55.469> five<00:00:55.649> six<00:00:55.949> years<00:00:56.160> ago<00:00:56.570> Sony<00:00:57.570> did<00:00:57.960> sue<00:00:58.350> the

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
mean five six years ago Sony did sue the

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.119 
mean five six years ago Sony did sue the
liq<00:00:59.820> sang<00:01:00.149> people<00:01:00.629> who<00:01:00.719> are<00:01:00.840> selling<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.320> psps

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
liq sang people who are selling the psps

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.570 
liq sang people who are selling the psps
and<00:01:02.340> such<00:01:02.579> um<00:01:03.049> so<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.080> guess<00:01:04.280> anonymous<00:01:05.280> is

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
and such um so I guess anonymous is

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.640 
and such um so I guess anonymous is
starting<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.630> actually<00:01:06.840> um<00:01:07.460> go<00:01:08.460> into<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.930> war

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
starting to actually um go into a war

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.820 
starting to actually um go into a war
mode<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.430> toward<00:01:12.420> Sony<00:01:13.020> because<00:01:13.380> frankly<00:01:13.799> I

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
mode on toward Sony because frankly I

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.390 
mode on toward Sony because frankly I
can<00:01:14.070> Sony<00:01:14.400> does<00:01:14.580> deserve<00:01:14.939> this<00:01:15.210> attack<00:01:15.659> um

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
can Sony does deserve this attack um

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.780 
can Sony does deserve this attack um
because<00:01:17.400> they<00:01:18.030> are<00:01:18.270> unfortunately<00:01:19.170> um<00:01:19.790> taking

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
because they are unfortunately um taking

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.550 
because they are unfortunately um taking
away<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.090> freedom<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.720> free<00:01:21.960> speech<00:01:22.290> act

away the freedom the free speech act

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.370 
away the freedom the free speech act
right<00:01:22.860> because<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.490> peripheral<00:01:24.450> product<00:01:25.020> it

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
right because I a peripheral product it

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.690

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
transformed into something else then

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.109 
transformed into something else then
people<00:01:32.009> should<00:01:32.430> have<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.759> right<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.939> know
