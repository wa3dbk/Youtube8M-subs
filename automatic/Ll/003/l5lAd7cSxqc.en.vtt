00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:13.799
 friends say welcome 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.170
 today let's take a look at cyberpunk 2.077 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.630
 and the newly released teaser trailer e 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.000
 what happens to you gentlemen who teaser 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.060
 trailer I was not so excited by 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.519
 times of that of deus ex 3 but for 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.109
 First, who are the project sites 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.340
 who doesn't know them and I hope they are 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.130
 really very few ones that 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.770
 they know this city manufacturer 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.739
 project is a home that developed the 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.450
 witcher 1 and 2 and for the moment it is not 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.300
 known for other titles if not for 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.270
 this funk 2077 server of which it is just 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.010
 the teaser has been released from the teaser possible 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.649
 vote as a graphic style either 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.660
 inspired by recent exit video games 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.420
 just like the deus ex human 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.579
 revolution especially for increases 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.609
 shaun that you can see on 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.370
 young lady both from the now cult films 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.129
 as a blade runner and therefore the structures 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.159
 and the means we can see scream 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.830
 own blade runner who has seen it 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.600
 will understand what he is talking about 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.909
 those who haven't seen it highly recommend it 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.490
 to see that movie because it is a 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.040
 masterpiece of the genre is obviously speaks 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.080
 of cyberpunk and is taken from the book the 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.150
 androids hunter written by philip 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.670
 dick that can be considered one of the 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.100
 fathers of literature 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.950
 returning to the title it is confirmed that it will be 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.170
 a gdr probably in the third person 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.820
 keeping the style of the witcher but 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.850
 obviously they could decide to 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.829
 experiment with another type of gameplay 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.189
 different from what we know instead 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.409
 speaking only of the taser trailer there 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.159
 the power of the increase is shown 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:53.000
 shaun both on a physical and only 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:55.590
 or the weight they have on the psyche 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.040
 of the human being leading to madness 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.460
 to the most susceptible individuals one 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.950
 once in crazy quotes is not 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.009
 you could always go back 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.709
 in quotes reset and then put 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.450
 in the psycho team that deals with 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.340
 these cyber 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.989
 sicop atc if we can call them that 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.360
 who will think like machines 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.220
 intelligent inferior considering the 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.590
 other bags of meat that are tomorrow 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.300
 we don't know any other details 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.550
 on the plot they have in store for us 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.110
 we will probably be part of the team 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.550
 psycho but we'll find out on February 5th 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.209
 maybe when others will be revealed 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.310
 details 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.709
 so for the moment there is nothing left 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.819
 who greet you friends of use and see you 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.239
 for the false myth 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.239
 Hello
