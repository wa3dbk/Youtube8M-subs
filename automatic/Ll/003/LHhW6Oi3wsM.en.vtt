00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
brakes to keep you upright you can even

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.569 
brakes to keep you upright you can even
see<00:01:36.869> at<00:01:37.049> one<00:01:37.259> point<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.799> kind<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.159> move<00:01:38.340> my

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
see at one point I kind of move my

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.630 
see at one point I kind of move my
pedals<00:01:39.000> get<00:01:39.450> them<00:01:39.630> back<00:01:39.869> into<00:01:40.110> position<00:01:40.640> so

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
pedals get them back into position so

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.990 
pedals get them back into position so
this<00:01:42.210> takes<00:01:42.479> some<00:01:42.630> core<00:01:43.350> some<00:01:44.130> balance<00:01:44.700> and

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
this takes some core some balance and

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.609 
this takes some core some balance and
some<00:01:46.880> just<00:01:47.880> looking<00:01:48.390> forward<00:01:48.930> looking<00:01:49.170> at<00:01:49.470> the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
front wheel and keeping it centered over

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
front wheel and keeping it centered over
the<00:01:51.689> bike<00:01:52.310> I<00:01:53.310> use<00:01:54.210> this<00:01:54.509> like<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.140> said<00:01:55.200> for
