00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.850 
wonderful now this recipe calls for some
brown<00:03:11.610> rice<00:03:11.959> instead<00:03:12.959> of<00:03:13.110> heating<00:03:13.590> up<00:03:13.830> the

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
brown rice instead of heating up the

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.170 
brown rice instead of heating up the
rice<00:03:14.100> separately<00:03:14.610> and<00:03:14.730> just<00:03:14.880> put<00:03:15.000> it<00:03:15.060> on<00:03:15.090> the

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
rice separately and just put it on the

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.120 
rice separately and just put it on the
plate<00:03:15.269> it's<00:03:15.540> very<00:03:16.019> flat<00:03:16.350> doesn't<00:03:16.800> have<00:03:16.890> a<00:03:16.920> lot

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
plate it's very flat doesn't have a lot

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.550 
plate it's very flat doesn't have a lot
of<00:03:17.160> flavor<00:03:17.459> I<00:03:17.730> added<00:03:18.360> a<00:03:18.450> little<00:03:18.480> extra<00:03:18.900> liquid

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
of flavor I added a little extra liquid

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.259 
of flavor I added a little extra liquid
and<00:03:19.739> we're<00:03:19.980> going<00:03:20.190> to<00:03:20.280> add<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.670> rice<00:03:20.820> right<00:03:21.120> in

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
and we're going to add the rice right in

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.240 
and we're going to add the rice right in
that<00:03:21.420> way<00:03:21.570> we<00:03:21.690> can<00:03:21.870> control<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.920> amount<00:03:23.100> of

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
that way we can control the amount of

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.740 
that way we can control the amount of
carbs<00:03:23.730> that<00:03:23.820> are<00:03:23.910> in<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.120> dish<00:03:24.239> okay<00:03:24.540> good

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
carbs that are in the dish okay good

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.449 
carbs that are in the dish okay good
perfect<00:03:25.170> probably<00:03:25.470> about<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.620> quarter<00:03:26.010> cup<00:03:26.040> per

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
perfect probably about a quarter cup per

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.520 
perfect probably about a quarter cup per
person<00:03:26.940> maybe<00:03:27.209> a<00:03:27.299> third<00:03:27.570> of<00:03:27.630> a<00:03:27.780> cup<00:03:27.930> okay<00:03:28.350> so

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
person maybe a third of a cup okay so

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.199
