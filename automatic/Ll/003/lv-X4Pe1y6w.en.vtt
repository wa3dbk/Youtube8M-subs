yeah<00:02:38.600> exactly<00:02:40.330> that<00:02:41.330> before<00:02:41.690> a<00:02:42.020> lot<00:02:42.410> of<00:02:42.470> stuff

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
yeah exactly that before a lot of stuff

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.110

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
and then the smaller more technical

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.620 
and then the smaller more technical
players<00:02:46.700> wouldn't<00:02:46.880> really<00:02:47.090> get<00:02:47.270> a<00:02:47.330> look-in

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630
