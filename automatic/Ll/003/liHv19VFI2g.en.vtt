gameplay on c-town I'm using the pp 90
which<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:22.760> pretty<00:00:23.760> awesome<00:00:24.240> for<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.480> submachine

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
which is pretty awesome for a submachine

which is pretty awesome for a submachine
gun<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:25.490> think<00:00:26.900> I'm<00:00:27.900> gonna<00:00:28.080> be<00:00:28.289> using<00:00:28.439> some

gun I think I'm gonna be using some
machine<00:00:29.039> guns<00:00:29.070> instead<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:30.000> this<00:00:30.210> past<00:00:30.480> 12<00:00:30.840> or

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
machine guns instead of this past 12 or

machine guns instead of this past 12 or
the<00:00:31.650> 1887<00:00:32.960> because<00:00:33.960> like<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.860> said<00:00:34.920> in<00:00:35.370> a

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
the 1887 because like I said in a

especially on this map because it's all

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.340 
especially on this map because it's all
very<00:01:04.589> small<00:01:05.010> hallways<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:06.350> doorways

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
little bit better in the Reaper you'll

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.789 
little bit better in the Reaper you'll
see<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:18.869> video<00:01:19.110> it's<00:01:19.320> not<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.500> hard

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
see it in this video it's not a hard

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.789 
see it in this video it's not a hard
kill<00:01:20.070> streak<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.549> use<00:01:20.820> but<00:01:21.470> it's<00:01:22.470> really

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
kill streak to use but it's really

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.740 
kill streak to use but it's really
dependent<00:01:23.100> on<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.520> map<00:01:23.729> if<00:01:24.000> they're<00:01:24.270> indoors

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
dependent on the map if they're indoors

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.719 
dependent on the map if they're indoors
you<00:01:25.200> can't<00:01:25.439> do<00:01:25.560> anything<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.369> could<00:01:26.520> sit

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
you can't do anything you could sit

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.210 
you can't do anything you could sit
around<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.150> try<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.330> curve<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.840> through<00:01:28.220> like

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
around and try to curve it through like

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.370 
around and try to curve it through like
through<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.549> door<00:01:29.880> but<00:01:30.540> it's<00:01:30.720> not<00:01:30.900> happening

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
through a door but it's not happening

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.960 
through a door but it's not happening
maybe<00:01:31.650> once<00:01:31.950> or<00:01:32.070> twice<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.549> could<00:01:32.700> do<00:01:32.820> that

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
maybe once or twice you could do that

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.679 
maybe once or twice you could do that
and<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:34.170> ac-130<00:01:34.770> once<00:01:35.280> again<00:01:35.549> also<00:01:36.000> dependent

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
and the ac-130 once again also dependent

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.469 
and the ac-130 once again also dependent
on<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.840> map<00:01:37.170> it's<00:01:38.159> obviously<00:01:38.610> it's<00:01:39.030> not<00:01:39.240> hard

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
on the map it's obviously it's not hard

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.560 
on the map it's obviously it's not hard
to<00:01:39.600> use<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:40.530> for<00:01:40.710> modern<00:01:40.950> warfare<00:01:41.100> 2<00:01:41.570> but

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
to use that for modern warfare 2 but

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.609 
to use that for modern warfare 2 but
no-one's<00:01:42.869> outdoors

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
no-one's outdoors

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.520 
no-one's outdoors
so<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.820> suggest<00:01:45.270> using<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.600> pave<00:01:45.810> low<00:01:46.079> instead

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
so I suggest using the pave low instead

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.880 
so I suggest using the pave low instead
it<00:01:47.460> sucks<00:01:47.850> because<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.869> ac-130<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:49.500> awesome

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
it sucks because the ac-130 is awesome

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.370 
it sucks because the ac-130 is awesome
but<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.159> pave<00:01:50.369> low<00:01:50.579> got<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.850> huge<00:01:51.180> huge<00:01:52.049> boost

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
but the pave low got a huge huge boost

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.039 
but the pave low got a huge huge boost
in<00:01:52.619> this<00:01:52.770> game<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.310> just<00:01:54.180> used<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.869> last

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
in this game I just used it in the last

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.709 
in this game I just used it in the last
game<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.350> got<00:01:55.560> like<00:01:55.770> like<00:01:56.579> 20<00:01:56.939> kills<00:01:57.180> with<00:01:57.390> it

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
game I got like like 20 kills with it

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:58.999 
game I got like like 20 kills with it
as<00:01:57.960> long<00:01:58.200> as<00:01:58.229> they<00:01:58.409> don't<00:01:58.500> shoot<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.890> down

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
as long as they don't shoot it down

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.670 
as long as they don't shoot it down
