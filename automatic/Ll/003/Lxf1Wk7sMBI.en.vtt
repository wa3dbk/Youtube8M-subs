00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.410 

downs<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:16.060> elevator<00:02:17.760> duty<00:02:18.760> motors<00:02:19.120> do

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420

downs and the elevator duty motors do
have<00:02:19.750> only<00:02:20.680> three<00:02:21.130> blades<00:02:21.460> I<00:02:21.930> guess<00:02:22.930> it<00:02:23.170> was

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
there m3/day it does produce a lot of

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.390 
there m3/day it does produce a lot of
wind<00:02:32.710> and<00:02:34.260> this<00:02:35.260> thing<00:02:35.500> about<00:02:35.650> this<00:02:36.010> is<00:02:36.220> it's

take<00:03:29.810> it<00:03:29.960> up<00:03:30.110> if<00:03:30.380> not<00:03:31.010> then<00:03:31.700> I'll<00:03:31.850> use<00:03:32.090> two
