00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:09.090
 there will be signs in the sun on the moon and in 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:11.790
 the stars lucas 21 25 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.969
 hello friends and welcome to the news 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.990
 most shocking of the moment today I'm going to 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:22.349
 talk about the incredible blood moons 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:25.830
 phenomena that will not be from the year 2003 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:28.199
 2004 that is to say for 11 years that no 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.560
 They occur in the blood moons 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.530
 I will explain later what it means 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.070
 the name on moons of blood or tetra das 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.309
 and what does this incredible phenomenon mean? 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.800
 and especially if it has something to do with 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.800
 the biblical prophecies so far 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.370
 and well, the moons of blood are no more 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.480
 that simple moon eclipses in some 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:07.320
 latitudes of the earth the moon acquires 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:10.530
 let's say a reddish hue and from there 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.600
 comes the name of blood moons 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.840
 what is clear is that usually 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.909
 it is related to biblical prophecies and 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.730
 with some catastrophic predictions 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.710
 especially for next year 2015 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.230
 this type of phenomena called 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.890
 centered are given when there are four 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:33.770
 total eclipses of moon in two years 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:38.030
 something that has not happened since 2003 and 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:41.060
 2004 however the phenomenon leaves 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:45.440
 some curiosities like for example 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:49.570
 from 1,600 to 1,900 there were no tetra hours 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:52.630
 but in this century 9 will be produced 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.329
 is this a sign of something 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.409
 I want to assume that it is not a sign of 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:01.979
 nothing since it is a natural phenomenon 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:05.110
 made by the moon the earth and the sun 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.240
 but surely many astrologers 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.880
 relate to some event 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.959
 apocalyptic especially as we are 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:17.310
 saying in 2015 but I from my 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:20.830
 point of view my humble point of view 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:24.040
 I would say that at least for now 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.250
 you worry because they are phenomena in 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.790
 those who are involved stars as can 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.860
 be the moon the sun the earth or could 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.190
 be mars as for example this month that 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.530
 is going to look very close and good as 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.239
 it can be another type of planets are 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:45.370
 phenomena that occur every x time 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.660
 every few years and they should not 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.060
 worry 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.730
 the first eclipse of the tetrad is 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.600
 will produce on April 15 that will be when 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:58.090
 the moon acquires a brown color but in 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.250
 some places will become more reddish 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.230
 by the refraction of the sun's rays 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.230
 in the Earth 's atmosphere 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.790
 the eclipse that will last 78 minutes will 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.810
 you can see in North America and the 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.959
 Western part of South America 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:20.110
 the tetrad will occur at intervals of 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.870
 approximately six months the three 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:26.739
 Finals were sighted the next 8 of 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:29.709
 October and in 2015 on April 8 and 28 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:32.800
 September so I hope that 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.220
 enjoy the phenomenon as much as I do and 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.620
 above all I hope it is not the prelude 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.900
 of something bad as the bible tells us 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.709
 although I think as if I'm counting 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.380
 that being astronomical phenomena 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:49.930
 Naturals does not have to happen anything is 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.930
 say they are cyclical phenomena is like the 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.530
 sunspot cycle that is 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.630
 it produces every 11 years 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.910
 although it is true speaking of this subject 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.030
 I will tell you that it is true that this 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:05.730
 year sunspots have been reduced 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.800
 enough but with respect to the moons 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.800
 of blood me from my humble point of 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.630
 I repeat, do not worry 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.670
 thank you very much for watching another video of 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.670
 amazing news until then
