fruit foot this holiday season and well
beyond<00:00:08.849> we're<00:00:09.210> taking<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.540> look<00:00:09.660> at<00:00:09.840> one<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.019> the

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
beyond we're taking a look at one of the

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:12.629 
first phones on sprint spark network and

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:14.959 
first phones on sprint spark network and
what<00:00:12.749> it's<00:00:12.870> doing<00:00:13.019> is<00:00:13.679> aggregating<00:00:14.610> multiple

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
what it's doing is aggregating multiple

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.040 
what it's doing is aggregating multiple
channels<00:00:15.240> in<00:00:15.599> the

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.980 
1.9 800 megahertz and 2.5 gigahertz and
the<00:00:21.759> end<00:00:21.910> result<00:00:22.119> is<00:00:22.480> what<00:00:22.630> we're<00:00:22.750> seeing<00:00:22.869> here

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990 
the end result is what we're seeing here

lab but the ideas are you going to get

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:51.990 
lab but the ideas are you going to get
much<00:00:50.350> faster<00:00:50.769> speeds<00:00:51.039> than<00:00:51.129> you<00:00:51.280> get<00:00:51.430> today<00:00:51.609> to

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
much faster speeds than you get today to

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.450 
much faster speeds than you get today to
give<00:00:52.120> you<00:00:52.149> an<00:00:52.269> idea<00:00:52.410> today's<00:00:53.410> 4G<00:00:53.800> LTE<00:00:53.949> phones

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
give you an idea today's 4G LTE phones

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.729 
give you an idea today's 4G LTE phones
get<00:00:54.640> anywhere<00:00:55.030> between<00:00:55.179> 5<00:00:55.719> and<00:00:55.899> 12<00:00:56.170> megabits

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
get anywhere between 5 and 12 megabits

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.619 
get anywhere between 5 and 12 megabits
per<00:00:56.800> second<00:00:57.160> so<00:00:57.250> you're<00:00:57.340> going<00:00:57.429> to<00:00:57.489> get<00:00:57.629> as

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
per second so you're going to get as

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.869 
per second so you're going to get as
much<00:00:58.809> as<00:00:58.989> five<00:00:59.230> times<00:00:59.559> the<00:00:59.739> speed<00:00:59.949> as<00:01:00.250> regular

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
much as five times the speed as regular

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.119 
much as five times the speed as regular

opposed<00:01:07.720> to<00:01:07.869> 4G<00:01:08.200> LTE<00:01:08.350> so<00:01:08.800> you'll<00:01:08.950> know<00:01:09.160> when

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
opposed to 4G LTE so you'll know when

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.340 
opposed to 4G LTE so you'll know when
you're<00:01:09.729> going<00:01:09.820> to<00:01:09.910> be<00:01:10.000> getting<00:01:10.119> those<00:01:10.840> fastest

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
you're going to be getting those fastest

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.580 
you're going to be getting those fastest
speeds<00:01:11.649> but<00:01:12.429> what<00:01:12.520> about<00:01:12.729> beyond<00:01:13.259> today<00:01:14.259> so

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
speeds but what about beyond today so

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.980 
speeds but what about beyond today so
after<00:01:15.009> these<00:01:15.399> phones<00:01:15.640> launched<00:01:16.090> let's<00:01:16.300> say<00:01:16.420> in

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
after these phones launched let's say in

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.870 
after these phones launched let's say in
the<00:01:17.080> middle<00:01:17.350> of<00:01:17.409> next<00:01:17.560> year<00:01:17.770> they're<00:01:18.670> going<00:01:18.789> to

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
the middle of next year they're going to

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.029 
the middle of next year they're going to
be<00:01:18.940> aggregating<00:01:19.479> two<00:01:19.810> of<00:01:20.140> their<00:01:20.470> 20<00:01:20.830> megahertz

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
be aggregating two of their 20 megahertz

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:23.040 
be aggregating two of their 20 megahertz
channels<00:01:21.550> into<00:01:21.700> 40<00:01:22.270> megahertz<00:01:22.780> of<00:01:22.989> spectrum

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
channels into 40 megahertz of spectrum

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.990 
channels into 40 megahertz of spectrum
and<00:01:23.739> with<00:01:24.190> that<00:01:24.340> you're<00:01:24.580> going<00:01:24.670> to<00:01:24.729> be<00:01:24.819> getting

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
and with that you're going to be getting

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.749 
and with that you're going to be getting
through<00:01:25.720> foot<00:01:25.959> in<00:01:26.140> excess<00:01:26.800> of<00:01:26.950> 200<00:01:27.429> megabits

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
through foot in excess of 200 megabits

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.359 
through foot in excess of 200 megabits
per<00:01:27.819> second<00:01:28.239> again<00:01:28.509> this<00:01:28.690> is<00:01:28.750> more<00:01:29.020> ideal

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
per second again this is more ideal

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.680 
per second again this is more ideal
conditions<00:01:30.369> but<00:01:30.580> you<00:01:30.670> can<00:01:30.819> see<00:01:31.060> that<00:01:31.090> sprint

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
conditions but you can see that sprint

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:32.930 
conditions but you can see that sprint
is<00:01:31.780> on<00:01:31.869> a<00:01:31.899> path

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
is on a path

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.250 
is on a path
that<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:33.150> going<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.330> offer<00:01:33.540> much<00:01:34.020> better

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
that it's going to offer much better

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.530 
that it's going to offer much better
throughput<00:01:34.590> than<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.980> is<00:01:35.100> today<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.760> when<00:01:36.450> you

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
throughput than it is today and when you

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.200 
throughput than it is today and when you
put<00:01:36.720> three<00:01:37.080> channels<00:01:37.470> together<00:01:37.820> equaling<00:01:38.820> 60

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
put three channels together equaling 60

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.360 
put three channels together equaling 60
megahertz<00:01:39.480> we're<00:01:40.110> looking<00:01:40.350> at<00:01:40.470> over<00:01:41.340> a

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
megahertz we're looking at over a

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.190 
megahertz we're looking at over a

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
gigabit down in fruit foot so yes this

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.140 
gigabit down in fruit foot so yes this
is<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.410> lab<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.980> we<00:01:47.670> want<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.880> see<00:01:48.000> what's

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150
