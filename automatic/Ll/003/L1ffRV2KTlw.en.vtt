00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.910 

I'm<00:00:00.179> here<00:00:00.390> today<00:00:00.659> to<00:00:00.719> show<00:00:01.050> you<00:00:01.110> how<00:00:01.350> to<00:00:01.380> make<00:00:01.680> a

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
I'm here today to show you how to make a

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.579 
I'm here today to show you how to make a
Hawaiian<00:00:02.820> paper<00:00:03.120> flower<00:00:03.540> and<00:00:03.929> there's<00:00:04.529> a

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
Hawaiian paper flower and there's a

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:05.840 
Hawaiian paper flower and there's a
couple<00:00:04.799> different<00:00:04.950> ways<00:00:05.370> that<00:00:05.549> I'll<00:00:05.670> show<00:00:05.819> you

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
couple different ways that I'll show you

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.509 
couple different ways that I'll show you
this<00:00:06.120> one<00:00:06.359> is<00:00:06.569> really<00:00:07.109> really<00:00:07.319> nice<00:00:07.560> but<00:00:08.309> it's

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
this one is really really nice but it's

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.120 
this one is really really nice but it's
also<00:00:08.730> very<00:00:08.880> delicate<00:00:09.330> so<00:00:09.900> we'll<00:00:10.590> see<00:00:10.920> which

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
also very delicate so we'll see which

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.749 
also very delicate so we'll see which
way<00:00:11.370> we<00:00:11.550> want<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.790> go<00:00:12.380> so<00:00:13.380> decide<00:00:14.250> about<00:00:14.460> the

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
way we want to go so decide about the

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.730 
way we want to go so decide about the
size<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.360> that's<00:00:15.420> what<00:00:15.750> this<00:00:15.929> would<00:00:16.170> be<00:00:16.199> this

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
size and that's what this would be this

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.519 
size and that's what this would be this
is<00:00:16.980> like<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.460> six<00:00:18.060> by<00:00:18.560> six<00:00:19.560> by<00:00:19.740> nine<00:00:21.199> piece<00:00:22.199> paper

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
is like a six by six by nine piece paper

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.009 
is like a six by six by nine piece paper
and<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.160> can<00:00:23.340> do<00:00:23.460> this<00:00:23.580> all<00:00:23.789> one<00:00:24.000> color<00:00:24.269> or<00:00:24.539> you

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
and you can do this all one color or you

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.630 
and you can do this all one color or you
could<00:00:25.170> do<00:00:25.289> multiple<00:00:25.500> colors<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.310> should<00:00:26.490> have

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
could do multiple colors you should have

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.490 
could do multiple colors you should have
six<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.060> eight<00:00:27.210> sheets<00:00:27.570> don't<00:00:27.779> go<00:00:27.960> over<00:00:28.289> eight

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
six to eight sheets don't go over eight

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.500 
six to eight sheets don't go over eight
because<00:00:28.859> then<00:00:29.010> it'll<00:00:29.220> be<00:00:29.340> too<00:00:29.699> much<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.359> deal

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
because then it'll be too much to deal

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.800 
because then it'll be too much to deal
with

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
with

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.650 
with
line<00:00:31.800> them<00:00:31.920> up<00:00:32.040> as<00:00:32.219> best<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.669> can<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.270> what

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
line them up as best you can and what

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.130 
line them up as best you can and what
you're<00:00:33.840> going<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.230> do<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.850> do<00:00:35.850> yourself<00:00:36.300> about

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
you're going to do is do yourself about

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.810 
you're going to do is do yourself about
an<00:00:37.290> inch<00:00:37.550> fold<00:00:38.550> back<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.270> forth<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.930> old

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
an inch fold back and forth the old

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:48.350 
an inch fold back and forth the old
familiar<00:00:41.930> fan<00:00:42.930> fold

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.139 

so<00:00:49.230> we<00:00:49.559> have<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:49.860> folded<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.610> we<00:00:50.820> need<00:00:51.000> to

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
so we have this folded and we need to

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.940 
so we have this folded and we need to
know<00:00:51.300> about<00:00:52.020> where<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.350> middle<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.770> it

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
know about where the middle is it

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.350 
know about where the middle is it
doesn't<00:00:53.129> have<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.460> be<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.579> permanent<00:00:54.090> crease

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
doesn't have to be a permanent crease

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.930 
doesn't have to be a permanent crease
and<00:00:54.720> I've<00:00:54.930> taken<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.379> pipe<00:00:55.680> cleaner<00:00:55.980> folded

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
and I've taken the pipe cleaner folded

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.420 
and I've taken the pipe cleaner folded
it<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.180> half<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.809> just<00:00:57.890> decide<00:00:58.890> which<00:00:59.160> one's

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
it in half and just decide which one's

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.040 
it in half and just decide which one's
going<00:00:59.610> to<00:00:59.640> be<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.850> top<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.390> want<00:01:00.510> purple<00:01:00.960> in

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
going to be the top you want purple in

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.540 
going to be the top you want purple in
the<00:01:01.170> center<00:01:01.500> do<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.829> want<00:01:02.010> yellow<00:01:02.220> in<00:01:02.399> the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
the center do you want yellow in the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.160 
the center do you want yellow in the
center<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.879> think<00:01:03.180> what<00:01:03.420> I'd<00:01:03.570> like<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.050> have

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
center I think what I'd like is to have

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.560 
center I think what I'd like is to have
purple<00:01:04.650> in<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.830> center<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:06.150> what<00:01:06.300> I'm<00:01:06.420> going

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
purple in the center so what I'm going

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.820 
purple in the center so what I'm going
to<00:01:06.690> do<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.350> bring<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:07.950> into<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.520> center

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
to do is bring that into the center

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.830 
to do is bring that into the center
bring<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.070> tight<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.640> then<00:01:11.820> twist<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.330> to

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
bring it in tight and then twist it to

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.399 
bring it in tight and then twist it to
three<00:01:13.050> times<00:01:13.320> make<00:01:13.740> sure<00:01:13.890> it's<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.190> secure

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
three times make sure it's in secure

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.380 
three times make sure it's in secure
like<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.680> now<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.520> could<00:01:17.820> leave<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.149> paper

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
like that now you could leave the paper

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.210 
like that now you could leave the paper
just<00:01:18.750> like<00:01:18.899> this<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.380> pull<00:01:19.530> your<00:01:19.649> paper<00:01:19.920> up

up<00:02:36.200> to<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:36.530> center<00:02:36.740> and<00:02:37.510> you<00:02:38.510> will<00:02:38.660> do<00:02:38.810> this<00:02:38.959> on

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200

up to the center and you will do this on
both<00:02:39.380> sides<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:44.180> sometimes<00:02:45.080> I<00:02:45.290> leave<00:02:45.500> a<00:02:45.530> bit

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
both sides and sometimes I leave a bit

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.130 
both sides and sometimes I leave a bit
of<00:02:46.070> a<00:02:46.190> bottom<00:02:46.610> one<00:02:46.820> just<00:02:47.450> to<00:02:47.600> make<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.900> flower

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
of a bottom one just to make the flower

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.590 
of a bottom one just to make the flower
look<00:02:48.470> a<00:02:48.590> little<00:02:48.800> bigger<00:02:49.090> see<00:02:50.090> if<00:02:50.150> we<00:02:50.270> can<00:02:50.450> get

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
look a little bigger see if we can get

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.270 
look a little bigger see if we can get
the<00:02:50.780> opposite<00:02:52.000> yellows<00:02:53.000> here<00:02:54.100> there<00:02:55.100> we<00:02:55.250> go

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
the opposite yellows here there we go

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.690 
the opposite yellows here there we go
and<00:02:56.470> I<00:02:57.470> might<00:02:57.650> change<00:02:57.890> my<00:02:58.010> mind<00:02:58.160> and<00:02:58.520> bring

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
and I might change my mind and bring

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.670 
and I might change my mind and bring
them<00:02:58.820> all<00:02:58.940> forward<00:02:59.480> but<00:02:59.690> sometimes<00:03:00.170> if<00:03:00.530> I

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
them all forward but sometimes if I

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.680 
them all forward but sometimes if I
leave<00:03:00.950> one<00:03:01.190> at<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.489> bottom<00:03:01.670> it<00:03:02.060> makes<00:03:02.450> it<00:03:02.630> a

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
leave one at the bottom it makes it a

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.290 
leave one at the bottom it makes it a
little<00:03:02.900> bit<00:03:03.080> bigger<00:03:03.550> this<00:03:04.550> I<00:03:04.700> might<00:03:04.880> bring<00:03:05.090> up

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
little bit bigger this I might bring up

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.810 
little bit bigger this I might bring up
a<00:03:05.420> little<00:03:05.600> bit<00:03:05.780> tighter<00:03:06.080> to<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.500> center<00:03:06.860> other

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.140 
a little bit tighter to the center other
side

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.260 

so<00:03:12.810> something<00:03:13.260> like<00:03:13.290> that<00:03:13.940> we<00:03:14.940> could<00:03:15.090> bring
