cardio when I got back from the gym I
actually<00:00:45.180> weighed<00:00:45.660> myself<00:00:45.899> again<00:00:46.350> just<00:00:46.559> to

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
actually weighed myself again just to

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.139 
actually weighed myself again just to
see<00:00:46.739> how<00:00:46.829> much<00:00:46.980> weight<00:00:47.190> maybe<00:00:47.460> I'd<00:00:47.700> burned<00:00:47.969> off

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
see how much weight maybe I'd burned off

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.130 
see how much weight maybe I'd burned off
and<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.690> waited<00:00:48.930> at<00:00:49.140> 20<00:00:49.700> 8.6<00:00:50.809> that<00:00:51.809> was<00:00:51.989> all

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
and I waited at 20 8.6 that was all

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.990 
and I waited at 20 8.6 that was all
water<00:00:52.410> weight<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:52.920> wasn't<00:00:53.190> even<00:00:53.370> really

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
water weight so I wasn't even really

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
water weight so I wasn't even really
tripping<00:00:54.300> over<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.570> because<00:00:54.780> i<00:00:54.960> figured

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
tripping over that because i figured

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.000 
tripping over that because i figured
it's<00:00:55.800> just<00:00:56.010> water<00:00:56.219> or<00:00:56.879> i<00:00:57.629> was<00:00:58.140> butt<00:00:58.410> naked<00:00:58.440> you

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.229 
it's just water or i was butt naked you
know<00:00:59.070> what<00:00:59.219> i<00:00:59.280> mean<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.670> really<00:00:59.940> wasn't

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239

you've been eating throughout the day

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.330 
you've been eating throughout the day
then<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.229> didn't<00:01:49.409> burn<00:01:49.590> all<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:49.890> stuff<00:01:50.130> off

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
then you didn't burn all this stuff off

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.889 
then you didn't burn all this stuff off
and<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:50.970> mean<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.299> probably<00:01:51.509> on<00:01:51.690> the<00:01:51.780> way<00:01:51.869> a

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
and it mean so you probably on the way a

and it mean so you probably on the way a
couple<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.500> maybe<00:01:53.039> a<00:01:53.100> pounded<00:01:53.610> two<00:01:53.759> more<00:01:54.000> at
