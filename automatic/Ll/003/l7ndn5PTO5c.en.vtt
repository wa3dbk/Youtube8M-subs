side that you're supposed to use side
number<00:00:17.070> one<00:00:17.250> first<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:18.029> this<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.840> sort<00:00:19.080> of

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
number one first and this is sort of

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.650 
number one first and this is sort of
like<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.500> fiber<00:00:19.920> eyes<00:00:20.220> primer<00:00:20.789> for<00:00:21.270> your<00:00:21.390> lashes

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.580 
like a fiber eyes primer for your lashes
and<00:00:22.260> so<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.550> just<00:00:23.580> looks<00:00:23.880> like<00:00:24.060> this<00:00:24.330> it's<00:00:24.869> sort

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
and so it just looks like this it's sort

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.939 
and so it just looks like this it's sort
of<00:00:25.830> cream<00:00:26.760> color<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:28.230> can<00:00:28.410> see<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.650> it

of cream color and you can see that it
has<00:00:28.980> like<00:00:29.460> tiny<00:00:29.760> little<00:00:29.910> fibers<00:00:30.869> in<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.199> that

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
and lengthen and make them thicker but i

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.020 
and lengthen and make them thicker but i
don't<00:00:37.320> really<00:00:37.410> like<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:37.890> primer<00:00:38.399> i<00:00:38.579> feel

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
don't really like this primer i feel

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.880 
don't really like this primer i feel
that<00:00:39.390> all<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.809> really<00:00:39.960> does<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.500> make<00:00:40.680> your

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
that all it really does is make your

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.910 
that all it really does is make your
mascara<00:00:41.399> apply<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.850> lot<00:00:42.210> clumsier<00:00:42.510> i<00:00:43.230> don't

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
mascara apply a lot clumsier i don't

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.860 
mascara apply a lot clumsier i don't
think<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.489> lengthens<00:00:45.000> your<00:00:45.090> lashes<00:00:45.420> it

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
think that it lengthens your lashes it

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.510 
think that it lengthens your lashes it
doesn't<00:00:46.200> seem<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.559> really<00:00:46.649> stick<00:00:47.039> on<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
doesn't seem to really stick on to the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.760 
doesn't seem to really stick on to the
ends<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.030> help<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.390> extend<00:00:48.629> your<00:00:49.020> lashes<00:00:49.230> very

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
ends and help to extend your lashes very

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.970 
ends and help to extend your lashes very
well<00:00:50.329> and<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.539> just<00:00:51.780> overall<00:00:52.379> didn't<00:00:52.800> really

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
well and I just overall didn't really

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.729 
well and I just overall didn't really
like<00:00:53.160> this<00:00:53.309> as<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.520> primer<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.899> doesn't<00:00:55.590> really

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
like this as a primer it doesn't really

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.189 
like this as a primer it doesn't really
help<00:00:56.190> with<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.059> application<00:00:57.750> or<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
help with the application or the

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.099 
help with the application or the
longevity<00:00:58.520> so<00:00:59.520> I<00:01:00.059> really<00:01:00.570> wouldn't<00:01:01.020> recommend

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
longevity so I really wouldn't recommend

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.820 
longevity so I really wouldn't recommend
that<00:01:01.530> side<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.100> mascara<00:01:02.930> however<00:01:03.930> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
that side of the mascara however the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.340 
that side of the mascara however the
second<00:01:05.369> step<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:06.030> mascara<00:01:06.659> which<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.140> the

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
second step of the mascara which is the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.420 
second step of the mascara which is the
bottom<00:01:07.799> one<00:01:08.090> has<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.390> same<00:01:09.659> style<00:01:10.049> wand<00:01:10.439> which

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
bottom one has the same style wand which

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.880 
bottom one has the same style wand which
is<00:01:11.640> kind<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.420> unique<00:01:12.720> style<00:01:13.229> it's<00:01:13.530> sort<00:01:13.740> of

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
is kind of a unique style it's sort of

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.670 
is kind of a unique style it's sort of
like<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.100> paddle<00:01:14.640> shaped<00:01:14.909> wand<00:01:15.330> it's<00:01:15.659> sort<00:01:16.590> of

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
like a paddle shaped wand it's sort of

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.710 
like a paddle shaped wand it's sort of
like<00:01:16.890> wider<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.850> way<00:01:18.060> but<00:01:18.240> when<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.360> turn<00:01:18.689> it

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
like wider this way but when you turn it

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.950 
like wider this way but when you turn it
this<00:01:18.960> way<00:01:19.020> it's<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.439> little<00:01:19.710> more<00:01:19.860> narrow<00:01:20.780> and<00:01:21.780> I

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
this way it's a little more narrow and I

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.749 
this way it's a little more narrow and I
really<00:01:22.229> like<00:01:22.409> how<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.619> tapers<00:01:22.920> down<00:01:23.189> at<00:01:23.640> the

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
really like how it tapers down at the

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.060 
really like how it tapers down at the
end<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.780> reason<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.409> like<00:01:25.619> this<00:01:25.830> is

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
end and the reason that I like this is

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.950 
end and the reason that I like this is
it<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.369> perfect<00:01:27.090> for<00:01:27.330> getting<00:01:27.509> your<00:01:27.750> lower

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
it is perfect for getting your lower

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.230 
it is perfect for getting your lower
lashes<00:01:28.350> if<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.369> really<00:01:29.670> want<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.909> make<00:01:30.030> them

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
lashes if you really want to make them

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.620 
lashes if you really want to make them
stand<00:01:30.630> out<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:31.340> find<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.700> extremely

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
stand out I find that it is extremely

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.710 
stand out I find that it is extremely
black<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.650> very<00:01:35.009> dark<00:01:35.310> mascara<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.150> tends

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
black it is a very dark mascara it tends

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.780 
black it is a very dark mascara it tends
to<00:01:36.869> flake<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.350> little<00:01:37.710> bit<00:01:37.860> on<00:01:38.040> me<00:01:38.280> during<00:01:38.579> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
to flake a little bit on me during the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.120 
to flake a little bit on me during the
end<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.119> day<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:40.200> don't<00:01:40.619> know<00:01:40.770> if<00:01:40.920> that's

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
end of the day I don't know if that's

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.590 
end of the day I don't know if that's
maybe<00:01:41.369> just<00:01:41.640> because<00:01:41.939> it's<00:01:42.119> getting<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.479> little

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
maybe just because it's getting a little

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.450 
maybe just because it's getting a little
older<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.170> drying<00:01:43.470> out<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.680> bit<00:01:43.920> or<00:01:44.040> something

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
older and drying out a bit or something

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.660 
older and drying out a bit or something
but<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.090> find<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.659> it's<00:01:45.810> very<00:01:45.960> thickening

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
but I find that it's very thickening

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.730 
but I find that it's very thickening
it's<00:01:47.670> not<00:01:47.820> really<00:01:48.030> clumpy<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.869> find<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.439> it

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
it's not really clumpy I find that it

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.490 
it's not really clumpy I find that it
helps<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:50.549> lengthen<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.390> define<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:52.140> doesn't

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
helps to lengthen and define it doesn't

my<00:01:58.860> lower<00:01:59.040> lashes<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.850> don't<00:02:00.149> really<00:02:00.299> like<00:02:00.450> it

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
my lower lashes I don't really like it

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.109 
my lower lashes I don't really like it
so<00:02:00.810> much<00:02:00.840> from<00:02:01.200> upper<00:02:01.590> lashes<00:02:01.799> because<00:02:02.640> I

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
so much from upper lashes because I

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.399 
so much from upper lashes because I
didn't<00:02:03.420> really<00:02:03.540> find<00:02:03.960> that<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.560> was<00:02:04.920> very

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
didn't really find that it was very

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.010 
didn't really find that it was very
separating<00:02:07.409> on<00:02:07.530> my

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
separating on my

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.010 
separating on my
upper<00:02:08.680> lashes<00:02:08.890> but<00:02:09.490> um<00:02:09.790> I<00:02:10.210> like<00:02:10.570> it<00:02:10.750> for<00:02:10.900> my

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
upper lashes but um I like it for my

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.010 
upper lashes but um I like it for my
lower<00:02:11.200> lashes<00:02:11.470> a<00:02:11.710> lot<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:13.150> those<00:02:13.600> are<00:02:13.750> just<00:02:13.810> my

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
lower lashes a lot so those are just my

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.840 
lower lashes a lot so those are just my
thoughts<00:02:14.110> quickly<00:02:14.860> on<00:02:15.040> this<00:02:15.280> I<00:02:15.550> Valene

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
thoughts quickly on this I Valene

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.840 
thoughts quickly on this I Valene
mascara<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:17.100> overall<00:02:18.100> I<00:02:18.130> think<00:02:18.370> is<00:02:18.610> a<00:02:18.640> really

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
mascara and overall I think is a really

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.750 
mascara and overall I think is a really
good<00:02:19.090> product<00:02:19.450> except<00:02:20.050> for<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.320> primer<00:02:20.760> um

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
good product except for the primer um

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.300 
good product except for the primer um
but<00:02:22.090> maybe<00:02:22.480> if<00:02:22.690> you're<00:02:22.870> doing<00:02:23.200> an<00:02:23.440> extreme

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
but maybe if you're doing an extreme

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.490 
but maybe if you're doing an extreme
makeup<00:02:24.730> look<00:02:25.210> when<00:02:25.660> someone<00:02:25.990> has<00:02:26.170> white

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
makeup look when someone has white

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.680 
makeup look when someone has white
eyelashes<00:02:27.130> on<00:02:27.280> you<00:02:27.490> could<00:02:27.640> try<00:02:27.820> this<00:02:27.880> for<00:02:28.480> that

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
eyelashes on you could try this for that

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.870 
eyelashes on you could try this for that
but<00:02:29.020> other<00:02:29.260> than<00:02:29.410> that<00:02:29.590> it's<00:02:29.980> kind<00:02:30.490> of<00:02:30.640> useless

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
but other than that it's kind of useless

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.120 
but other than that it's kind of useless
to<00:02:31.390> me<00:02:31.450> i<00:02:31.540> don't<00:02:31.900> really<00:02:32.020> like<00:02:32.140> it<00:02:32.440> at<00:02:32.560> all<00:02:32.710> but

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
to me i don't really like it at all but

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.700 
to me i don't really like it at all but
i<00:02:33.370> really<00:02:34.300> like<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.630> second<00:02:34.960> step<00:02:35.140> but<00:02:35.380> for<00:02:35.590> me

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
i really like the second step but for me

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.700 
i really like the second step but for me
that's<00:02:36.010> kind<00:02:36.310> of<00:02:36.430> worth<00:02:36.670> it<00:02:36.910> for<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:38.410> wand

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
that's kind of worth it for the the wand

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.430 
that's kind of worth it for the the wand
and<00:02:39.130> just<00:02:39.670> for<00:02:40.240> the<00:02:40.390> shape<00:02:40.690> of<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:40.960> brush<00:02:41.200> and

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
and just for the shape of the brush and

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.100 
and just for the shape of the brush and
everything<00:02:41.830> and<00:02:42.040> also<00:02:42.910> i<00:02:43.150> could<00:02:43.630> mention<00:02:43.780> that

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
everything and also i could mention that

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.370 
everything and also i could mention that
it's<00:02:44.650> very<00:02:44.890> conveniently<00:02:45.700> short<00:02:46.380> you're

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
it's very conveniently short you're

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.530 
it's very conveniently short you're
holding<00:02:47.800> onto<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.370> tube<00:02:48.700> while<00:02:49.360> you're

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
holding onto the tube while you're

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.050 
holding onto the tube while you're
applying<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:50.110> product<00:02:50.350> so<00:02:51.010> that's<00:02:51.490> kind<00:02:51.790> of<00:02:51.880> a

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
applying the product so that's kind of a

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.130 
applying the product so that's kind of a
neat<00:02:52.690> feature<00:02:52.960> that<00:02:53.680> you're<00:02:54.010> holding<00:02:54.280> the

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
neat feature that you're holding the

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.630 
neat feature that you're holding the
product<00:02:56.140> in<00:02:56.290> this<00:02:56.410> tiny<00:02:56.680> little<00:02:56.920> case<00:02:57.340> and

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
product in this tiny little case and

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.940 
product in this tiny little case and
then<00:02:57.730> you've<00:02:57.880> got<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.300> whole<00:02:58.540> other<00:02:59.140> tube<00:02:59.680> to

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
then you've got the whole other tube to

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.570 
then you've got the whole other tube to
hold<00:03:00.130> on<00:03:00.280> to<00:03:00.520> while<00:03:00.670> you're<00:03:00.750> applying<00:03:01.750> it<00:03:02.140> um

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
hold on to while you're applying it um

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.820 
hold on to while you're applying it um
but<00:03:03.580> I<00:03:03.970> really<00:03:04.420> like<00:03:04.600> this<00:03:04.750> mascara<00:03:05.230> and<00:03:05.500> I

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.560 
but I really like this mascara and I
think<00:03:06.100> that<00:03:06.340> it's<00:03:06.520> totally<00:03:06.880> worth<00:03:07.270> the<00:03:07.300> money

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
think that it's totally worth the money

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.880 
think that it's totally worth the money
