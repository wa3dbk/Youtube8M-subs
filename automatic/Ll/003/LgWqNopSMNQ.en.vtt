00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.760
Do you remember when Archon unboxed
a replica of the Gears of War

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.440
Lancer for you?

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.960
Time for something similar. Today,
we'll take a closer look at the

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.620
Portal Gun replica from the game which
probably needs no introduction.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:22.210
Like the Lancer is a 1:1 scale replica
made by a company called NECA.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.610
The Valve logo on the box suggests of
course that it is a licensed product.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:35.390
That's what the box looks like and
in a moment we'll take a peek at its
contents.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.780
The styrofoam insert contains cuts

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.860
which makes it much easier to remove
it from the cardboard. A small guesture

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.720
but much appreciated.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.660
The device itself is made of plastic
and isn't too heavy.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.760
Although I'd love to tell you how
heavy, my bathroom scales did not

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.930
even register the fact that the

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.030
Portal Gun was laying on it so
the best word to describe it

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.570
will be "light".

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.090
I must admit that from the ergonomic
point of view, this is not the best

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.790
thought-out device, as it lacks, for
instance room to comfortably rest

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.860
the idle hand but we must remember
that this is a replica based

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.250
on models extracted from the game.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.690
These 3 elements surrounding the barrel
which I cannot name have two

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.600
articulation points and allow us to set
them in a convenient position.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.530
Were it a review, not an unboxing video,
I would probably argue that it is

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.770
the low point of the item, quality wise.
You can see some unevenness in the material.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.510
Nothing tragic, but it is visibly lower
quality than the rest.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.670
For the supernosy here's the instruction
manual from the box. Nothing interesting,

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.540
as it contains the same info as the box.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.520
Here we see the handle, which gives us
access to the trigger as well as

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.240
a swich which controls the portal colour

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.190
triggering it from blue to orange
and vice versa. This is also where

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.360
the battery slot is.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.910
The 3 wires runing along the, what
we might call, chamber are made

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.060
of flexible plastich which allows

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.610
them to maintain the given shape.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.780
Ergonomics I mentioned earlier, or
rather its absence makes the device

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.920
not the most comfortable thing
to operate but 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.160
let's face it - it is something that
is meant to lie on the shelf and look nice.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.190
I think that it'll have no problems
with that. But this invention is

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.670
capable of more. For this however,
we will need batteries.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.830
And not just any type either
because our new toy

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.830
takes three "C" type batteries. I'm
almost certain that a lot of you

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.960
never had to use those. And for
a good reason. The tray shape

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.250
and form reminds me of a magazine
inserted into the device's handle.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.380
Now, let's get it all back home
where we'll be able to take a closer look

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.080
at the light effects.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:16.240
As you can see, the interior of the barrel,
the tube and the button at the top

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.510
light up.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.900
Using our thumb we can change the colour
of the leds. I think the blue one

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.170
is a little bit stronger but that might
just be me. There are also

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:33.260
three red leds which I don't remember
from the game and to be honest...

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.360
my memory seems to be serving me well,
as there are no additional Christmas

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.970
lights on the in-game one.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.100
But as you can see, the light from them
is so intense that we can play not only

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:52.880
a test subject but also our favourite
space hunter.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.410
As you can hear, each of the portal
variants comes with a set of different

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.350
sound samples. Speaking of sounds,
because the whole item is made out

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:17.730
of plastic, it tends to crackle
when moved around. Hear for yourself.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.060
Am I satisfied with my purchase?
I am.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.290
I'll happily buy a set of matching
orange overalls and go to a

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:40.180
halloween party dressed as one of
GLaDOS victims. Assuming of course

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.630
that anyone will ever invite me...

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.960
I'm Grem, and you have just watched
an arhn.eu video.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.740
See you next time! Bye!
