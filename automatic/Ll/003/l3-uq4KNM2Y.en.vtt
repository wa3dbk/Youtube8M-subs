00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.400 

and<00:00:02.730> what<00:00:02.879> should<00:00:03.120> happen<00:00:03.330> on<00:00:03.600> this<00:00:03.780> plug<00:00:04.110> is

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
and what should happen on this plug is

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.070 
and what should happen on this plug is
that<00:00:05.040> this<00:00:05.330> should<00:00:06.330> be<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.600> ground<00:00:06.839> this

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
that this should be the ground this

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.379 
that this should be the ground this
exposed<00:00:07.589> wire<00:00:07.890> should<00:00:08.160> be<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.429> ground<00:00:08.700> it

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
exposed wire should be the ground it

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.720 
exposed wire should be the ground it
should<00:00:09.660> be<00:00:09.780> that<00:00:09.870> when<00:00:10.019> I<00:00:10.080> hooked<00:00:10.260> my<00:00:10.730> ground

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
should be that when I hooked my ground

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.850 
should be that when I hooked my ground
clamp<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.509> that<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:12.990> stick<00:00:13.320> this<00:00:13.469> down<00:00:13.530> in

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
clamp to that and stick this down in

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.040 
clamp to that and stick this down in
here<00:00:14.040> I<00:00:14.190> should<00:00:14.219> get<00:00:14.580> light<00:00:14.790> but<00:00:15.750> I'm<00:00:15.870> not

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
here I should get light but I'm not

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.779 
here I should get light but I'm not
interesting<00:00:19.050> enough<00:00:19.080> I<00:00:19.470> can<00:00:19.770> bypass<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.279> and

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
interesting enough I can bypass that and

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.370 
interesting enough I can bypass that and
take<00:00:20.910> my<00:00:21.060> ground<00:00:21.359> directly<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.900> my<00:00:22.020> bumper

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
take my ground directly to my bumper

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.490 
take my ground directly to my bumper
here<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.789> works<00:00:24.000> which<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.109> telling<00:00:25.350> me

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
here and it works which is telling me

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.980 
here and it works which is telling me
that<00:00:25.529> my<00:00:25.800> problem<00:00:26.220> is<00:00:26.430> right<00:00:26.840> here

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
that my problem is right here

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.500 
that my problem is right here
this<00:00:28.320> wire<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.800> not<00:00:29.099> grounded<00:00:29.550> probably<00:00:30.449> if

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
this wire is not grounded probably if

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.939 
this wire is not grounded probably if
that<00:00:30.660> wire<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:30.990> grounded<00:00:31.410> everything's<00:00:31.800> going

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
that wire is grounded everything's going

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.889 
that wire is grounded everything's going
to<00:00:31.980> work<00:00:32.189> right<00:00:32.430> so<00:00:32.700> that's<00:00:33.239> going<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.420> be<00:00:33.510> mine

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
to work right so that's going to be mine

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.580 
to work right so that's going to be mine
my<00:00:34.350> first<00:00:34.590> task<00:00:34.890> here<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.280> going<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.640> be<00:00:35.850> to

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
my first task here is going to be to

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.560 
my first task here is going to be to
reground<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.920> wire<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.460> those<00:00:39.270> should<00:00:39.450> have

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
reground that wire and those should have

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.639 
reground that wire and those should have
good<00:00:39.719> lights<00:00:39.960> after<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:42.350> okay<00:00:43.350> I'll<00:00:43.440> show

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
good lights after that okay I'll show

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.799 
good lights after that okay I'll show
you<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:43.980> all<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:44.940> did<00:00:45.270> was<00:00:45.480> went<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.719> the

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
you this all I did was went to the

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.069 
you this all I did was went to the
ground<00:00:46.170> as<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.620> comes<00:00:46.860> from<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.370> truck<00:00:47.670> and

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
ground as it comes from the truck and

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.139 
ground as it comes from the truck and
here<00:00:49.079> there's<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.379> spot<00:00:49.800> where<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.940> wire

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
here there's a spot where the wire

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.600 
here there's a spot where the wire
connects<00:00:51.660> together<00:00:52.110> I've<00:00:52.559> got<00:00:52.920> ground<00:00:53.250> here

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
connects together I've got ground here

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.830 
connects together I've got ground here
but<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.789> don't<00:00:54.030> have<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.210> here<00:00:54.510> at<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.660> end<00:00:54.690> of

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
but I don't have it here at the end of

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.389 
but I don't have it here at the end of
the<00:00:54.899> plug<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.199> somewhere<00:00:55.770> between<00:00:55.920> here<00:00:56.340> and

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
the plug so somewhere between here and

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.090 
the plug so somewhere between here and
here<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.789> where<00:00:56.969> I'm<00:00:57.090> losing<00:00:57.600> my<00:00:58.289> ground<00:00:58.680> I

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
here is where I'm losing my ground I

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.029 
here is where I'm losing my ground I
also<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.760> thought<00:00:59.940> I'd<00:01:00.030> show<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.559> how<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.620> how

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
also I thought I'd show you how you how

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.549 
also I thought I'd show you how you how
you<00:01:02.100> establish<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.760> ground<00:01:03.120> basically<00:01:04.110> all<00:01:04.439> you

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
you establish a ground basically all you

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.370 
you establish a ground basically all you
do<00:01:04.650> with<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.830> ground<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.430> attach<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:06.030> wire<00:01:06.380> to

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
do with the ground is attach a wire to

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.080 
do with the ground is attach a wire to
some<00:01:07.619> point<00:01:07.920> on<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.220> body<00:01:08.400> where<00:01:08.670> it's

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
some point on the body where it's

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.750 
some point on the body where it's
connected<00:01:09.720> directly<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.350> metal<00:01:10.650> if<00:01:10.950> you

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
connected directly to the metal if you

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.840 
connected directly to the metal if you
can<00:01:11.939> see<00:01:12.240> right<00:01:13.229> here<00:01:15.140> this<00:01:16.140> wire<00:01:16.860> runs<00:01:17.549> right

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
can see right here this wire runs right

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.679 
can see right here this wire runs right
to<00:01:18.200> this<00:01:19.200> frame<00:01:19.860> where<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:20.909> bolted<00:01:21.299> this

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
to this frame where this is bolted this

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.359 
to this frame where this is bolted this
bumper<00:01:22.110> hitch<00:01:22.259> right<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.830> frame<00:01:23.040> so

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
bumper hitch right to the frame so

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.890 
bumper hitch right to the frame so
that's<00:01:23.490> how<00:01:23.700> we<00:01:23.759> have<00:01:24.240> we<00:01:24.360> have<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.659> ground

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
that's how we have we have the ground

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.840 
that's how we have we have the ground
and<00:01:25.290> we<00:01:25.740> have<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.950> ground<00:01:26.220> like<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.850> said<00:01:27.229> to<00:01:28.229> here

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
and we have a ground like I said to here

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.990 
and we have a ground like I said to here
so<00:01:29.850> basically<00:01:30.659> all<00:01:30.990> I've<00:01:31.259> got<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.590> do<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:32.000> is

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
so basically all I've got to do is is

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.940 
so basically all I've got to do is is
find<00:01:33.509> out<00:01:33.689> where<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.140> brake<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.799> there's

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
find out where the brake is and there's

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.760 
find out where the brake is and there's
a<00:01:35.009> little<00:01:35.220> piece<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.520> tape<00:01:35.700> right<00:01:36.270> here<00:01:36.900> that's

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
a little piece of tape right here that's

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.810 
a little piece of tape right here that's
pretty<00:01:37.920> good<00:01:38.100> chance<00:01:38.340> that's<00:01:38.490> where<00:01:38.729> my

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
pretty good chance that's where my

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.889 
pretty good chance that's where my
problem<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.299> we'll<00:01:39.930> check<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.170> out<00:01:41.899> okay

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
problem is we'll check that out okay

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.330 
problem is we'll check that out okay
this<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.229> pretty<00:01:43.409> telling<00:01:43.890> when<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.040> went<00:01:44.280> to

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
this is pretty telling when I went to

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.990 
this is pretty telling when I went to
pull<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.670> tape<00:01:44.850> off<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.720> came<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.500> -<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:47.009> think<00:01:47.700> I

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
pull the tape off it came in - I think I

00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:21.100 
pull the tape off it came in - I think I
might<00:01:48.210> have<00:01:48.299> found<00:01:48.509> my<00:01:48.630> problem<00:01:48.990> right<00:01:49.200> there

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.630 

okay<00:02:22.110> what<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.319> did<00:02:22.500> here<00:02:22.739> is<00:02:22.769> I<00:02:22.920> cut<00:02:23.159> this<00:02:23.310> wire

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
okay what I did here is I cut this wire

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.210 
okay what I did here is I cut this wire
I<00:02:24.000> used<00:02:24.480> one<00:02:24.629> of<00:02:24.720> these<00:02:24.840> blue<00:02:25.080> clamps<00:02:25.590> clamps

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
I used one of these blue clamps clamps

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.729 
I used one of these blue clamps clamps
it<00:02:26.310> all<00:02:26.430> back<00:02:26.640> together<00:02:27.170> if<00:02:28.170> I<00:02:28.319> wanted<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.620> get

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
it all back together if I wanted to get

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.710 
it all back together if I wanted to get
real<00:02:28.950> fancy<00:02:29.220> they<00:02:29.730> make<00:02:29.940> these<00:02:30.239> things<00:02:30.299> where

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
real fancy they make these things where

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.509 
real fancy they make these things where
you<00:02:30.840> can<00:02:31.019> heat<00:02:31.319> these<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.040> hens<00:02:32.280> will

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
you can heat these and the hens will

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.369 
you can heat these and the hens will
kind<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:32.849> shrink<00:02:33.209> wrap<00:02:33.450> down<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:33.930> seal<00:02:34.170> this

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
kind of shrink wrap down and seal this

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.740 
kind of shrink wrap down and seal this
up<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:34.890> don't<00:02:35.610> have<00:02:35.819> those<00:02:36.060> handy<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.569> thought

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
up I don't have those handy I thought

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.780 
up I don't have those handy I thought
about<00:02:36.959> replacing<00:02:37.500> this<00:02:37.620> here<00:02:38.459> this<00:02:38.610> is<00:02:38.670> a

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
about replacing this here this is a

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.180 
about replacing this here this is a
connection<00:02:39.269> my<00:02:39.390> dad<00:02:39.629> made<00:02:39.930> but<00:02:40.799> it<00:02:40.860> seems<00:02:41.040> like

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
connection my dad made but it seems like

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.920 
connection my dad made but it seems like
it's<00:02:41.370> on<00:02:41.519> there<00:02:41.700> awfully<00:02:42.209> well<00:02:42.420> I<00:02:42.450> think<00:02:42.660> he's

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
it's on there awfully well I think he's

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.420 
it's on there awfully well I think he's
actually<00:02:43.260> even<00:02:43.440> sorted<00:02:43.860> that's<00:02:44.099> what<00:02:44.340> I'm

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
actually even sorted that's what I'm

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.680 
actually even sorted that's what I'm
going<00:02:44.519> to<00:02:44.580> do<00:02:44.670> is<00:02:44.760> just<00:02:44.879> tape<00:02:45.150> over<00:02:45.510> that

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
going to do is just tape over that

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.059 
going to do is just tape over that
because<00:02:45.989> that<00:02:46.230> seems<00:02:46.410> like<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.620> really<00:02:46.829> good

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
because that seems like a really good

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.920 
because that seems like a really good
connection<00:02:47.340> if<00:02:48.120> I've<00:02:48.329> done<00:02:48.480> everything

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
connection if I've done everything

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.899 
connection if I've done everything
correctly<00:02:48.959> we<00:02:49.590> should<00:02:49.620> have<00:02:50.040> we<00:02:50.640> should<00:02:50.670> have

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
correctly we should have we should have

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:52.550 
correctly we should have we should have
a<00:02:50.940> good<00:02:51.120> grounding<00:02:51.480> some<00:02:51.629> lights<00:02:51.870> let's<00:02:52.349> just

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
a good grounding some lights let's just

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.640 
a good grounding some lights let's just
see<00:02:52.709> if<00:02:52.799> it<00:02:52.890> works

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.330 

Hey<00:02:58.650> look<00:02:58.799> at<00:02:58.920> that

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
Hey look at that

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.099 
Hey look at that
I<00:02:59.370> bet<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.299> trailer<00:03:00.540> lights<00:03:00.780> are<00:03:00.900> going<00:03:01.049> to

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
I bet the trailer lights are going to

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:07.339 
I bet the trailer lights are going to
work<00:03:01.260> now<00:03:02.480> let's<00:03:03.480> plug<00:03:03.660> them<00:03:03.750> in<00:03:03.870> and<00:03:03.900> see<00:03:06.349> okay

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
work now let's plug them in and see okay

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.030 
work now let's plug them in and see okay
this<00:03:07.650> lights<00:03:07.890> working<00:03:08.599> and<00:03:09.599> a<00:03:10.500> little<00:03:10.769> marker

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
this lights working and a little marker

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.970 
this lights working and a little marker
light<00:03:11.220> right<00:03:11.430> here<00:03:11.459> is<00:03:11.760> working<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.769> the<00:03:13.769> turn

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.380 
light right here is working and the turn
signal<00:03:14.400> is<00:03:14.519> working<00:03:15.140> and<00:03:16.140> I<00:03:17.120> believe<00:03:18.120> we<00:03:18.239> have

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
signal is working and I believe we have

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.460 
signal is working and I believe we have
a<00:03:18.420> light<00:03:18.660> in<00:03:18.870> here<00:03:19.290> that's<00:03:19.470> working<00:03:19.709> and<00:03:21.470> that

a light in here that's working and that
marker<00:03:22.920> light<00:03:23.069> is<00:03:23.250> working<00:03:24.889> a<00:03:25.889> little<00:03:26.190> bit<00:03:26.519> too

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
marker light is working a little bit too

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:30.440 
marker light is working a little bit too
see<00:03:26.790> ya<00:03:27.200> and<00:03:28.400> that<00:03:29.400> marker<00:03:29.849> light<00:03:30.000> is<00:03:30.120> working

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
see ya and that marker light is working

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.680 
see ya and that marker light is working
if<00:03:31.230> I<00:03:31.440> switch<00:03:31.799> my<00:03:32.030> turning<00:03:33.030> signals<00:03:33.419> to<00:03:33.569> the

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
if I switch my turning signals to the

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.259 
if I switch my turning signals to the
other<00:03:33.870> way<00:03:34.190> and<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.459> other<00:03:35.609> side<00:03:35.880> should<00:03:36.150> be

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
other way and the other side should be

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.470 
other way and the other side should be
working<00:03:36.650> this<00:03:37.650> truck<00:03:37.950> uses<00:03:38.639> the<00:03:38.819> same<00:03:39.060> bulb

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
working this truck uses the same bulb

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.839 
working this truck uses the same bulb
for<00:03:40.109> the<00:03:40.260> brake<00:03:40.470> light<00:03:40.769> and<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.220> turn<00:03:41.400> signal

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
for the brake light and the turn signal

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.670 
for the brake light and the turn signal
which<00:03:42.480> means<00:03:42.690> it's<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:42.870> turn<00:03:43.109> signal<00:03:43.440> work

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
which means it's the turn signal work

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.170 
which means it's the turn signal work
and<00:03:43.889> the<00:03:43.950> bright<00:03:44.160> lights<00:03:44.190> are<00:03:44.639> going<00:03:44.970> to<00:03:45.060> be

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
and the bright lights are going to be

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.229 
and the bright lights are going to be
working<00:03:46.430> later<00:03:47.430> I'm<00:03:47.609> going<00:03:47.760> to<00:03:47.819> have<00:03:47.940> someone

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
working later I'm going to have someone

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.319 
working later I'm going to have someone
to<00:03:48.359> look<00:03:48.569> I<00:03:48.930> can<00:03:49.410> hit<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.739> brakes<00:03:50.060> and<00:03:51.060> we<00:03:51.180> can

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
to look I can hit the brakes and we can

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.020 
to look I can hit the brakes and we can
check<00:03:51.569> that<00:03:51.750> out<00:03:52.310> here's<00:03:53.310> my<00:03:53.549> other<00:03:53.760> light

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
check that out here's my other light

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.370 
check that out here's my other light
working<00:03:54.769> we<00:03:55.769> are<00:03:55.799> good<00:03:56.310> to<00:03:56.459> go<00:03:56.489> I<00:03:57.389> probably

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
working we are good to go I probably

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.470 
working we are good to go I probably
will<00:03:58.560> not<00:03:58.769> hook<00:03:58.980> up<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.250> backup<00:03:59.639> lights<00:03:59.910> just

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
will not hook up the backup lights just

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.069 
will not hook up the backup lights just
because<00:04:02.030> too<00:04:03.030> much<00:04:03.180> trouble<00:04:03.450> not<00:04:03.750> enough<00:04:03.959> I'm

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
because too much trouble not enough I'm

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.839 
because too much trouble not enough I'm
going<00:04:04.200> to<00:04:04.290> get<00:04:04.440> out<00:04:04.560> of<00:04:04.739> it<00:04:04.829> the<00:04:05.280> way<00:04:05.310> this<00:04:05.609> rig

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.490 
is set up I hope I don't do any backing
with<00:04:08.819> it<00:04:08.970> I<00:04:09.090> wouldn't<00:04:09.419> want<00:04:09.569> to<00:04:09.629> be<00:04:10.290> pretty

hard to see what I'm doing if I did so

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.360
