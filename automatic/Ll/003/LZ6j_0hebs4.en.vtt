 previously but good now I have a 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.680
 issue a little time 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.300
 and here I bring you a new tweet that 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.640
 you're really going to like a lot 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.190
 people something more especially to the 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.650
 users that we have an iphone 4s and 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.170
 we have what is the civic psuv 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.210
 and as you know to be 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.309
 speaking in Spanish if we update to the 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.110
 version and bone but the son 6 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.019
 currently has many errors with the 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.540
 maps then it really does not suit that 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:58.280
 update until it's not real and 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:00.739
 these maps but also you you X 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.629
 reason would be for the serves I 'm going to 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.100
 recommend now that you do not do it because 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.170
 with this new tweet that I'm going to 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.630
 present now when you can have the 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.509
