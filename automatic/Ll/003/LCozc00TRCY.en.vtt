00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.140
 David against Goliath in the second round 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.210
 of the german ladies basketball cup 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.519
 the second league table leader bad aibling 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.860
 fireballs against the sixth of the first

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.029
 class difference no trace 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.460
 It went off well for the firegirls 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.830
 Emma Danker attended with a threesome 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.990
 Start for an optimal start 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.430
 The Canadian made the top ten 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.180
 the aibling clots in the 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.670
 alleingang 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.009
 It was her cream quarter and she did 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.469
 therefore as many points as usual in one 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.390
 whole game towards the end of the quarter 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.640
 The fouls of aibling and 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.170
 so that the free throws for donau ries 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.989
 first division thus decided the first 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.809
 pass with 21 to 18 for themselves 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.700
 then sierra aigle came hard 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.070
 fails and fueled up three times 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.739

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.039
 three point game to 27 to 23 for bath 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.230
 aibling the firewalls missed it 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.520
 good defensive with the expansion of 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.860
 to reward leadership 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.350
 Donau came slowly but surely 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.979
 ran back and finally took the book 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.229
 In the hand 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.150
 the compensation succeeded darling gutters 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.880
 only two minutes before half time through 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.530
 The birthday boy Juliana can jay jay 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.259

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.229
 that means everything good in Serbian everything 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.200
 good then at half-time break 38 37 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.479
 for the outsider an unsportsmanlike 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.579
 foul of gerrard brought the firegirls 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.990
 at the beginning of the second half with four 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.000
 score in the back meet 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.430
 some inconsistencies in the game structure 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.090
 and unfortunate 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.799
 referee decisions 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.320
 not exactly positive for that 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.420
 fireball game from donau-ries first time 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.280
 six points in front with another 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.869
 However, three points shortened the game 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.030
 her own was in the backlog and 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.430
 inoculated their team a new courage 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.040
 Donau Ries cracked as the first team 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.590
 with two free throws the 50 points mark 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.540
 the fifth team foul by juliana 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.070
 knew with language the firewalls in the 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.380
 last three minutes of the third 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.899
 quarter in distress yet donau ries 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.610
 met only every second throw for it 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.710
 succeeded tories number eight countries 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.500

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.360
 quarter end 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.320
 with a three a big point to the 59 too 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.300
 52 for the guests 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.730
 the catch-up movement of the aiblinger 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.130
 inside were the first points in the 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.410
 fourth quarter of donau ries muffled 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.870
 lena bradaric bet with a threesome 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.730
 nor a sign and emma thank you 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.440
 fought two more points 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.240
 after two attacks of the guests 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.310
 successfully repelled 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.440
 so were the fireballs again to 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.450
 at six points, that was it 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.130
 highest of feelings in the final phase 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.320
 the fireballs had to foul the fifth 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.450
 by carla bellscheidt and accept 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.250
 With that died her last hope 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.989
 to land a sensation 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.480
 donau-ries played it quietly home 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.850
 and finally ended up with a 76 too 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.680
 64 victory in bad aibling in the third 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.970
 Round of german ladies basketball 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.100
 move in the cups 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.310
 the fireballs have a great 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.980
 fight delivered and in the end just barely 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.670
 against a retaliating opponent 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.010
 lost 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.310
 yes really long time at eye level 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:12.299
 always played back and forth though his 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.360
 sometimes risks a tick in the front 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:17.880
 Compliment the great performance 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.600
 if we play the rest of the league 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.600
 I believe then 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.650
 one has seen that the fireballs with 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:27.180
 a first division can keep up and 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.980
 that makes you courage for the coming ones 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.200
 second division duties because on the weekend 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.689
 the firegirls have to go to Speyer 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.879
 league competitors then marriage on the second 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:40.099
 november the next home game in the fire 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:40.099
 dome against viernheim is pending
