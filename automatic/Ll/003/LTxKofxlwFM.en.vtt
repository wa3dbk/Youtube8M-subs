now the biggest difference obviously is

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.610 
now the biggest difference obviously is
the<00:00:50.880> fact<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.360> starting<00:00:51.750> side<00:00:52.050> by<00:00:52.290> side

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
the fact that is starting side by side

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.900 
the fact that is starting side by side
but<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.070> looked<00:00:53.280> like<00:00:53.370> they<00:00:53.550> were<00:00:53.610> starting

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
but that looked like they were starting

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.400 
but that looked like they were starting
to<00:00:54.060> get<00:00:54.150> in<00:00:54.270> line<00:00:54.450> Scott<00:00:54.810> didn't<00:00:55.050> they<00:00:55.110> did<00:00:55.290> it
