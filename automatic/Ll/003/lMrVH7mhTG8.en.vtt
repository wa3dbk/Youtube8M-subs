00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.840
 Good day to all with you Brian 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.269
 today we look at the next addons 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.679
 the bartender 4 he can change 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.289
 all your interface up 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.119
 unrecognizable when we installed it 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.340
 next to the minimap we have a new one 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.859
 icon by clicking on it with the left button 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.330
 mouse we enter the mode which can 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.760
 move our panels 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.400
 it is good to put a tick sticking 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.170
 panels in this case the panels will be as 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.390
 would stick to each other thereby 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.640
 becomes exactly as if because 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.399
 icon and right click it 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.739
 we will enter our addon settings so 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.600
 the first daw if we do not click on it 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.940
 will be in the mode of movement 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.710
 panels let's say we need panels we 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.500
 already put therefore this daw 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.600
 definitely put the following fix 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.219
 buttons look if we have this 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.800
 the jackdaw is not necessary that a button 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.410
 by chance during battle we can throw away 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.870
 so here is also a daw 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.520
 we put the last and we are responsible for 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.799
 icon next to the minimap 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.590
 so all three jackdaws we must 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.960
 stand next we have a key assignment to 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.970
 Sorry if you install this addon 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.220
 and you will enjoy it all 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.740
 bind the keys on the new but the very 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.450
 appointment is made very simple for 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.159
 start we tick for this 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.470
 character because surely you have 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.570
 also not one character after that we 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.619
 mouse over the button which 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.810
 we want to bind 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.540
 and then click on the button 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.159
 the keyboard that's all that spell 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.259
 my lump will be my example now 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.479
 shift + 2 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.700
 invisibility chef 3 and so on and again 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.400
 Do not forget that the case if you addon 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.790
 remove the keys have bindi on 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.130
 new we go farther in our panels 6 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.590
 However, this add-on and makes it possible to 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.960
 add 4 more panels and as you understand 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.479
 each panel is configured separately 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.579
 let's consider what for example 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.979
 you can apply the settings on the example 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.049
 the first panel I took it a little to the right 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.840
 so that it was visible so what about us 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.850
 there is a tab basic parameters 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.560
 Well, firstly with this tick we 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.840
 we can generally remove this panel 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.000
 slightly lower we have transparency ie we 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.120
 we can make this panel to be 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.920
 barely barely visible to the right scale we can 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.160
 make absolutely tiny icons or 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.840
 just huge they are the gap then 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.150
 have we can do the distance between 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.370
 badges either big or small 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.780
 to the right of the button we can reduce 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.209
 number of buttons 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.250
 just below we go again two jackdaws 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.480
 the first one increases the size a little 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.090
 button images 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.129
 and the second shows a grid just below 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.720
 us the slider with which we 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:43.440
 we can change the number of lines and 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.319
 columns but slightly lower there are still 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.310
 some minor settings go to 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.010
 next tab 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.959
 this is not a visibility this tab allows 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.150
 extensive adjust panel relatively 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.489
 transparency but for example you have 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.950
 tab with mount animals which you 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.650
 call infrequently also with pets there 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.720
 I do not know the tale we build there with the professions 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.090
 macros that are also times 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.069
 hundred years therefore it is rather comfortable all this 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.500
 put on a separate tab and make 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.180
 its transparent and with regards to two 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.670
 the remaining panels are the settings 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.220
 state and positioning as far as I am 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.220
 correctly understood they are not very necessary and so 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.840
 applicable to all 10 panels 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.209
 go down below we still have extra 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.810
 actionbar for what I need not really 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.569
 got it 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.549
 then we have a micro menu from me you 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.620
 you can see it in the lower left then 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.019
 there is this where character abilities and 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.340
 talents and so on you can make them 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.560
 more less 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.110
 change the gap between them and everything 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.390
 the rest and the same applies to 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.580
 panels with pets and to the bags panel 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.709
 we still have a blizzard panel 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.890
 standard if someone likes it 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:52.709
 you can and return descend even lower 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.709
 and we have a preset tab this is something 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.780
 like patterns but be careful what 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.970
 if you use one of these so 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.099
 called templates all your settings 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.560
 interface they will get together and have 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:06.060
 customize new but pretty patterns 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.879
 quite good that is they can be used 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.879
 how the workpiece was given to refine 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:14.040
 screw it up on your own 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.060
 addon I also really liked of course 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.400
 I do not know will 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.620
 i use this interface modified 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.590
 or not but at least twist 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.960
 poyuzat was very interesting and on this 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.580
 release came to an end thanks for watching 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.060
 subscribe to my channel and to new 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.060
 meeting
