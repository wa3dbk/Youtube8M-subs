00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.640
 do not 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.960
 two 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.960
 to 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.240
 Y 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:32.560
 the saddest end 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:39.760
 oh yes 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:42.629
 there's an end of the year 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.629
 how 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.690
 the ruins 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.780
 I had 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:08.579
 today 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:18.479
 if you are comfortable 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:37.360
 and down 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.360
 we go 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.050
 to the 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.620
 t 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.920
 all right 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.730
 and we end up in the biggest 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.580
 d 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.360
 i 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.170
 do not 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.370
 yes 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.370
 one 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.220
 i 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.370
 and to play the part arpeggio 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:37.300
 sung we are going to place the ring fingers 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.310
 medium and index in the first second and 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.230
 third strings and the thumb is going to 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.620
 unwrap in these three strings of 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:50.050
 according to the chord that we are playing 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:53.610
 we start in re and we touch thumb index 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.890
 half index 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.860
 cancel 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.900
 index 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.900
 medium and index 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.920
 and 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.239
 I was remembering the sun is not necessary 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.069
 we put it complete with this video here 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.620
 because we are only touching 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:36.019
 arpeggios and that's why we 're 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.019
 putting is with the bass and with this finger 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:41.150
 and when we arrived at this I agreed that it is 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.180
 only second suspended 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.909
 we have to put these fingers follow 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.430
 same and this finger that we have left 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:52.819
 free because we are not using the fifth 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.030
 we'll put it on the third string 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.030
 rope 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.140
 and with those indications you will not have 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.000
 problems in getting this song out 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.000
