00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.909 

it's<00:00:05.279> called<00:00:05.700> car<00:00:06.060> driving<00:00:06.649> it's<00:00:07.649> a

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
it's called car driving it's a

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.070 
it's called car driving it's a
continuation<00:00:08.460> of<00:00:08.880> what<00:00:09.120> we<00:00:09.150> did<00:00:09.510> from<00:00:09.809> last

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
continuation of what we did from last

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.860 
continuation of what we did from last
term<00:00:10.530> that's<00:00:10.889> car<00:00:11.160> parking<00:00:11.519> okay<00:00:12.000> so<00:00:12.630> in<00:00:12.750> this

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
term that's car parking okay so in this

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.799 
term that's car parking okay so in this
case<00:00:13.139> most<00:00:13.679> probably<00:00:13.980> it's<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.400> 2d<00:00:14.849> version<00:00:15.030> but

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
case most probably it's a 2d version but

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.050 
case most probably it's a 2d version but
we<00:00:16.020> have<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.410> road<00:00:16.650> move<00:00:17.160> in<00:00:17.400> front<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:17.880> the

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
we have the road move in front of the

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.260 
we have the road move in front of the
car<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.660> starting<00:00:19.500> from<00:00:19.710> this<00:00:19.949> game<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:21.029> car

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
car and starting from this game the car

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.529 
car and starting from this game the car
will<00:00:21.510> drive<00:00:21.779> through<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.980> certain<00:00:23.670> track<00:00:23.880> when

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
will drive through a certain track when

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.410 
will drive through a certain track when
it<00:00:24.689> finishes<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.439> game<00:00:25.560> will<00:00:25.949> show<00:00:26.160> past<00:00:26.460> if

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
it finishes the game will show past if

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.200 
it finishes the game will show past if
it<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:27.930> on<00:00:28.199> any<00:00:28.830> curve<00:00:29.250> on<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.699> other<00:00:29.939> way

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
it is on any curve on the other way

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.179 
it is on any curve on the other way
there<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.660> will<00:00:30.900> show<00:00:31.349> if<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.619> failed

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
there it will show if it failed

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.590 
there it will show if it failed
okay<00:00:33.710> we<00:00:34.710> reuse<00:00:35.160> most<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.000> hardware<00:00:36.270> as<00:00:36.420> we

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
okay we reuse most of the hardware as we

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.450 
okay we reuse most of the hardware as we
use<00:00:36.780> last<00:00:37.170> term<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:37.890> yeah<00:00:38.010> but<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.309> have<00:00:38.430> a

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
use last term so yeah but you have a

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.889 
use last term so yeah but you have a
steering<00:00:38.850> wheel<00:00:38.879> here<00:00:39.360> yeah<00:00:39.690> with

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
steering wheel here yeah with

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.319 
steering wheel here yeah with
accelerometers<00:00:40.829> yeah<00:00:41.280> you've<00:00:41.670> got<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:41.940> brake

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
accelerometers yeah you've got the brake

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.420 
accelerometers yeah you've got the brake
pedals<00:00:42.809> on<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.170> brake<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.860> accelerator

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
pedals on the brake and accelerator

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:59.500 
pedals on the brake and accelerator
pedals<00:00:44.850> on<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.030> floor<00:00:45.420> made<00:00:45.719> out<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:46.050> hinges

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.610 

okay<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.660> FPGA<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.260> doing<00:01:01.530> the

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
okay and the FPGA is doing the

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.319 
okay and the FPGA is doing the
computation<00:01:02.370> for<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.579> graphics<00:01:03.149> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
computation for the graphics the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.990 
computation for the graphics the
computer<00:01:03.690> graphics<00:01:04.400> okay<00:01:05.400> do<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.729> want<00:01:05.909> to

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
computer graphics okay do you want to

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:25.850 
computer graphics okay do you want to
demo<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.360> please<00:01:18.710> slowly<00:01:19.710> go<00:01:20.130> forward<00:01:22.070> okay<00:01:24.860> so

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
demo it please slowly go forward okay so

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.749 
demo it please slowly go forward okay so
you<00:01:25.920> step<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.520> gas

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
you step on the gas

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.230 
you step on the gas
yeah<00:01:27.540> when<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.170> go<00:01:28.380> faster<00:01:31.610> and<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:32.939> have

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
yeah when you go faster and so you have

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.410 
yeah when you go faster and so you have
to<00:01:33.950> so<00:01:34.950> she<00:01:35.009> can<00:01:35.340> she<00:01:35.670> can<00:01:35.700> control<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.299> speed

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
to so she can she can control the speed

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.160 
to so she can she can control the speed
by<00:01:36.780> pressing<00:01:36.920> harder<00:01:37.920> or<00:01:38.280> slow<00:01:38.700> or<00:01:39.119> not<00:01:39.540> that

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
by pressing harder or slow or not that

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.740 
by pressing harder or slow or not that
far<00:01:40.470> down<00:01:40.500> via<00:01:40.950> gas<00:01:41.460> pedal<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.119> she<00:01:42.450> can<00:01:42.600> also

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
far down via gas pedal and she can also

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.899 
far down via gas pedal and she can also
break<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.140> car<00:01:43.500> whenever<00:01:43.649> she<00:01:43.950> needs<00:01:44.189> do

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.109 

so<00:01:47.420> during<00:01:47.689> the<00:01:47.780> game<00:01:47.960> while<00:01:48.320> she's<00:01:48.530> burns<00:01:49.119> you

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
so during the game while she's burns you

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:51.999 
so during the game while she's burns you
can<00:01:50.299> see<00:01:50.509> the<00:01:50.630> roller<00:01:50.869> will<00:01:51.170> rotate<00:01:51.439> according

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
can see the roller will rotate according

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.140 
can see the roller will rotate according
you<00:01:52.310> mm-hmm<00:01:54.430> during<00:01:55.430> the<00:01:55.520> time<00:01:55.729> that<00:01:55.759> they're

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
you mm-hmm during the time that they're

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.240 
you mm-hmm during the time that they're
drilled<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:56.720> the<00:01:57.080> width<00:01:57.350> of<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.740> road<00:01:57.920> also

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
drilled the the width of the road also

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.520 
drilled the the width of the road also
changes<00:01:58.700> because<00:01:58.880> they<00:01:59.450> know<00:01:59.840> that<00:01:59.869> most<00:02:00.259> of

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
changes because they know that most of

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.740 
changes because they know that most of
the<00:02:00.649> roads<00:02:00.860> are<00:02:00.979> manually<00:02:01.399> thrown<00:02:01.790> I<00:02:02.149> know<00:02:02.600> it

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
the roads are manually thrown I know it

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.469 
the roads are manually thrown I know it
course<00:02:02.960> that's<00:02:03.170> nothing

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.749 

oh<00:02:05.509> so<00:02:05.990> you<00:02:06.110> see<00:02:06.440> it<00:02:06.560> so<00:02:06.860> these<00:02:07.009> are<00:02:07.220> these<00:02:07.700> are

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
oh so you see it so these are these are

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.960 
oh so you see it so these are these are
spline<00:02:08.390> curves<00:02:08.810> or<00:02:09.229> can<00:02:09.770> darken<00:02:10.190> curves<00:02:10.640> can't

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
spline curves or can darken curves can't

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.820 
spline curves or can darken curves can't
compute<00:02:11.300> it's<00:02:11.510> piecewise<00:02:12.170> linear<00:02:12.500> curves

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
compute it's piecewise linear curves

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.620 
compute it's piecewise linear curves
computed<00:02:13.400> in<00:02:13.550> MATLAB<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:14.300> then<00:02:16.450> put<00:02:17.450> them<00:02:17.569> in

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
computed in MATLAB and then put them in

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:28.920 
computed in MATLAB and then put them in
a<00:02:17.690> memory<00:02:17.989> image<00:02:18.230> file<00:02:18.530> and<00:02:18.860> send<00:02:19.160> them<00:02:19.280> across

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:37.809 

very<00:02:29.930> good<00:02:30.200> okay<00:02:36.069> so<00:02:37.069> you<00:02:37.130> just<00:02:37.220> drove<00:02:37.580> off<00:02:37.790> the

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
very good okay so you just drove off the

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:50.440 
very good okay so you just drove off the
road<00:02:38.000> yeah<00:02:48.100> so<00:02:49.100> the<00:02:49.280> reason<00:02:49.610> that<00:02:49.730> we<00:02:49.910> get<00:02:50.030> into

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
road yeah so the reason that we get into

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.440 
road yeah so the reason that we get into
three<00:02:51.290> key<00:02:51.500> car<00:02:52.370> driving<00:02:52.790> view<00:02:53.000> is<00:02:53.209> the

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
three key car driving view is the

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.210 
three key car driving view is the
computation<00:02:54.110> is<00:02:54.350> too<00:02:55.040> too<00:02:55.910> much<00:02:57.010> so<00:02:58.010> now<00:02:58.160> we

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
computation is too too much so now we

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.180 
computation is too too much so now we
can<00:02:58.579> show<00:02:58.790> a<00:02:58.820> 3d<00:02:59.450> view<00:02:59.720> of<00:02:59.959> the<00:03:00.380> current<00:03:00.829> status

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
can show a 3d view of the current status

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.069 
can show a 3d view of the current status
of<00:03:01.519> the<00:03:01.579> car<00:03:01.880> static<00:03:02.870> oh<00:03:04.209> okay<00:03:05.209> yeah<00:03:05.510> and<00:03:05.720> we

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
of the car static oh okay yeah and we

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:10.510 
of the car static oh okay yeah and we
can<00:03:06.230> switch<00:03:06.500> back

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.150 

as<00:03:11.520> well<00:03:11.730> alright<00:03:12.120> so<00:03:12.180> are<00:03:12.750> you<00:03:12.930> are<00:03:13.770> you<00:03:13.890> doing

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
as well alright so are you are you doing

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.790 
as well alright so are you are you doing
the<00:03:14.310> computations<00:03:15.030> on<00:03:15.150> an<00:03:15.270> iOS<00:03:15.480> yeah<00:03:16.440> and<00:03:16.709> you

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
the computations on an iOS yeah and you

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.559 
the computations on an iOS yeah and you
have<00:03:16.920> PGA<00:03:17.370> yeah<00:03:17.819> aha

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
have PGA yeah aha

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.620 
have PGA yeah aha
okay<00:03:18.900> which<00:03:19.200> is<00:03:19.410> a<00:03:20.150> medium<00:03:21.150> performance

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
okay which is a medium performance

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:22.550 
okay which is a medium performance
microcontroller

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
microcontroller

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:32.239 
microcontroller
right<00:03:22.740> it's<00:03:28.010> okay<00:03:29.180> thank<00:03:30.180> you
