00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello how about friends animals I am 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.190
 eric cruz and in a previous video I les them 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.560
 talk about that to help an animal 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.360
 all they need is to have the 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.650
 willingness to do it and to exemplify 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.780
 that advice that I told them I want 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.820
 introduce a woman to a person 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.460
 that unfortunately you want to save your 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.470
 identity for personal reasons but 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.470
 that definitely had the courage had 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.390
 courage had the strength to help 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.250
 a puppy that needed it and is a 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.750
 He cures a person who courageously 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.699
 he faced with people to be able 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.260
 help this little animal that 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.180
 I found a pretty situation 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.579
 pretty bad the only weapon of this 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.200
 person in addition to its value and its 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.390
 courage and his decision was a 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.160
 credential that you provide makes some 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.690
 time and he asked me to be able to 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.969
 approaching people and being able to 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.550
 talk with them identify and good 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.340
 in this way and with this credential and 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.500
 especially with his decision was how could 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.500
 help this little animal let's see back 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.710
 how 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.180
 if this Monday I went with my husband 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.150
 who accompanied me and we found in the 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.640
 worst circumstances omen like that 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.770
 called the puppy of about 15 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.530
 years old impressive his state 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.530
 he can hardly move his paws by the 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:24.100
 malnutrition so severe that they have to 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:27.729
 the lack of vital fluid as is the 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:31.360
 water you see that they have deprived him very much 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:34.270
 good food and water time had a 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.160
 string of approximately 30 to 40 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.440
 centimeters that I did not even allow him 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.990
 walk because your muscles are already 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.450
 they find stunted because of that 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.700
 the veterinarian tells us on the other hand what 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.880
 what impressed me most was that when 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.990
 he made his own his own pipi 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.810
 He desperately started drinking it 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.780
 proof that a long time has 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.210
 remained without water first I 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.490
 I identified and told him he was going because 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.380
 I was worried about the situation of 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.289
 little animal that could not believe that 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.659
 there were people who mistreated so much 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:08.440
 a helpless being above all as it is 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.990
 good 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.810
 can make an animal of those if in 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.510
 his face we see the living image of a 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.880
 noble dog the gentleman then does not lend himself to 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.340
 dialogue told me the man that I was 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.330
 crazy and that he did not care that I was 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.490
 an old dog that they were going to sacrifice 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.430
 and that I would do what I wanted to do 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.950
 He turned his back and ran to the 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.220
 inside his home the wife came out 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.040
 and that's when he told me that they 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.860
 they do not take care of the dog because they really 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.650
 the dog is not theirs from the children 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.260
 if I told the lady that if I did not 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.480
 I wanted to give it to us the lady said that 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.420
 not because their children were going to bother and 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.430
 how the lady who was going to fire them was not going to 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.200
 please have mercy on that 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.990
 poor little animal that we do not 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.210
 I would like a more powerful being to come 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.740
 in quotes that we and we 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.200
 they will treat us as if we were 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:08.140
 slaves then I think the lady is 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.030
 moved and came out with a knife the 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.090
 I really was afraid because it was 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.269
 a pretty long knife 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.310
 it really was to cut the tie that 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.800
 I had the puppy when the lady 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.599
 he cut the tie the puppy started to 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.690
 walk with your legs all 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:26.250
 trembling from lack of movement 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.280
 I asked the lady to please 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:33.060
 carry water and the puppy stuck close to 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.849
 5 minutes like this with its slowness thanks to 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.580
 the kindness of one of a person is what 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:41.670
 they took the vet and the puppy 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.980
 because he is already eating he is advancing 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.989
 slowly in your state of health I do not 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.780
 I understand how there can be such people 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.730
 stupid people so idiot so hollow 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.530
 so empty chest brain so empty 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.510
 of the heart people that surely we 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.489
 Missing Mass every Sunday is 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.690
 asking God for mercy is 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.510
 asking for work is asking 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.310
 blessings and that surely and I do not say 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.140
 that all but that many people who 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.140
 they go to church they have an animal 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.730
 on the roof in the backyard 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.860
 moored to a window etc. and so on 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.319
 etcetera people who believe devoutly 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.510
 in god they believe devoutly in Jesus Christ 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.400
 and they pour water or boiling oil on a 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.079
 Hungry dog ​​that comes to your door 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.340
 because people come to your business 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.989
 run a dog from your entrance 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.330
 simply because it is getting off the 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.949
 rain or cold or heat what does not 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.560
 I explain myself and I have always asked myself and 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:31.259
 this without hurting susceptibilities is 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.240
 because God if it exists because God 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:35.340
 allows these people do what 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.110
 do with animals and I do not want 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.699
 delve into the subject if they have any 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.169
 theory out there lies in the box of the 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.880
 comments there are some comments that 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.190
 they write that equally and I can give myself a 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.560
 idea of why this happens and I'm going to 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.720
 tell the quick anecdote and this and it is 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.520
 something that was very recorded to me makes a 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.440
 time an agreement that I went for a dog 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.810
 they had in very bad conditions a 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.699
 small dog a dog that 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.380
 they had only rain in the open 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:00.060
 without water without food that had it 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.620
 moored to a window and that when 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.419
 I got to knock on the door to talk to 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.930
 the people left a lady a lady 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:09.210
 you know classic apron flip flops and 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.990
 I asked him hey chicken because he has in 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.820
 these conditions 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.820
 to the puppy and he told me 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.200
 I told him how old are you dog 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.370
 says people and has always had it if 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.370
 I asked him and he said 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:34.080
 it's something that surprised me 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.819
 it was quite surprising was that when I 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.610
 opened the door to the bottom there was an altar 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:41.580
 huge a huge altar with a virgin of 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.409
 guadalupe family size and his house his 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.969
 house was a huge house then I would 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:47.069
 I asked lady are you catholic is 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:49.080
 religious and he told me if I told him of 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:51.479
 truth is it is religious catholic believes in 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.430
 God and he said yes yes I believe in him I say 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:55.620
 lady, all the animals are supposed to 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.449
 they are the Lord's creation and therefore all 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.400
 the animals tell me respect they deserve 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:02.159
 be respected for the simple fact of 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.349
 be a creation of someone we believe in 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:06.270
 or who do you think you stayed 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:08.460
 The lady was silent when I told her 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.229
 volte entered shame I said look what 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.360
 that you have behind as it is possible that 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:14.310
 you have this devotion for the 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.310
 religion for good and how is it possible 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:19.180
 have an animal in these conditions 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:21.070
 you are not born just 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.660
 and he told me and I'll kill the dog you 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.699
 I said no, I'm going to take this 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.470
 animal because I do not want that after a while 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:28.270

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.220

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:56.990
 I thank them for their courage, impotence and many 

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.660
 wishes to continue working because there 

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:01.670
 many animals in this state that the 

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:04.010
 people just say to the poor guy 

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:05.690
 but he does not do anything and with a 

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:07.670
 poor, they will not be able to 

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.620

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:12.220
 hope that they have to change 

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.220
 your way of life
