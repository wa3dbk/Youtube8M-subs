and<00:00:20.590> I<00:00:20.680> have<00:00:20.770> the<00:00:20.860> diagram<00:00:21.250> so<00:00:22.140> how<00:00:23.140> did<00:00:23.290> I<00:00:23.350> get

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
and I have the diagram so how did I get

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.810 
and I have the diagram so how did I get
the<00:00:23.560> car<00:00:23.740> that's<00:00:23.890> close<00:00:24.130> to<00:00:24.160> my<00:00:24.370> house

I rode right up my sidewalk next to my
porch<00:00:29.590> so<00:00:30.220> I'll<00:00:30.340> have<00:00:30.520> light<00:00:30.870> so<00:00:31.870> let's<00:00:31.900> see<00:00:32.140> if

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
porch so I'll have light so let's see if

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.209 
porch so I'll have light so let's see if
we<00:00:32.259> could<00:00:32.469> do<00:00:32.559> it<00:00:33.450> all<00:00:34.450> right<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:35.680> if<00:00:35.829> we<00:00:35.860> can't

00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:36.219 
we could do it all right and if we can't

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:37.530 
we could do it all right and if we can't
tomorrow's<00:00:36.790> another<00:00:37.030> day

tomorrow's another day
yeah<00:00:38.380> there<00:00:38.680> it<00:00:38.770> is<00:00:38.829> down<00:00:39.070> there

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.070 

I'm<00:00:44.590> loosening<00:00:45.040> the<00:00:45.300> tension<00:00:46.300> pulley<00:00:46.330> now<00:00:46.720> the

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.080 
I'm loosening the tension pulley now the

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.320 
I'm loosening the tension pulley now the
outside<00:00:47.260> nut<00:00:47.770> and<00:00:48.220> then<00:00:48.580> I'll<00:00:48.730> go<00:00:48.880> and<00:00:49.000> loosen

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.330 
outside nut and then I'll go and loosen

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.220 
outside nut and then I'll go and loosen
up<00:00:49.450> the<00:00:49.600> back<00:00:49.810> nut<00:00:50.760> in<00:00:51.760> a<00:00:51.910> second<00:00:52.450> so<00:00:52.990> these<00:00:53.110> are

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
up the back nut in a second so these are

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.260 
up the back nut in a second so these are
the<00:00:53.290> first<00:00:53.470> two<00:00:53.650> once<00:00:53.830> I<00:00:53.950> do<00:00:54.010> that<00:00:54.130> I<00:00:54.520> should<00:00:55.120> be

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
the first two once I do that I should be

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.550 
the first two once I do that I should be
able<00:00:55.360> to<00:00:55.480> flip<00:00:55.690> the<00:00:55.840> belt<00:00:56.050> on<00:00:56.200> we'll<00:00:56.440> see<00:00:58.560> I'm

00:00:59.550 --> 00:00:59.560 
able to flip the belt on we'll see I'm

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.790 
able to flip the belt on we'll see I'm
doing<00:00:59.830> this<00:00:59.920> one<00:01:00.100> around<00:01:00.340> back<00:01:00.610> now<00:01:01.770> put<00:01:02.770> a

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
doing this one around back now put a

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.750 
doing this one around back now put a
pulley<00:01:03.040> tensioning<00:01:03.670> pulley<00:01:04.440> tension<00:01:05.440> pulley

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
pulley tensioning pulley tension pulley

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.370

so<00:01:06.760> for<00:01:07.090> this<00:01:07.180> and<00:01:07.390> be<00:01:07.479> loose<00:01:07.660> enough<00:01:07.990> for<00:01:08.260> me

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
so for this and be loose enough for me

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.150 
so for this and be loose enough for me
to<00:01:08.850> move<00:01:09.850> that<00:01:10.090> inside<00:01:10.570> the<00:01:10.750> belt<00:01:10.930> on<00:01:11.110> which<00:01:11.500> is

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
to move that inside the belt on which is

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.560 
to move that inside the belt on which is
tricky<00:01:12.430> and<00:01:12.700> it's<00:01:13.630> hard<00:01:14.170> squat<00:01:14.680> I<00:01:14.860> can't<00:01:15.570> it's

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
tricky and it's hard squat I can't it's

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.180 
tricky and it's hard squat I can't it's
hard<00:01:16.780> to<00:01:16.930> reach<00:01:17.080> in<00:01:17.229> here<00:01:17.380> my<00:01:17.590> big<00:01:17.770> sausage

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
hard to reach in here my big sausage

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.350 
hard to reach in here my big sausage
fingers<00:01:18.750> but<00:01:19.750> I<00:01:20.580> feel<00:01:21.580> mechanic<00:01:22.030> with<00:01:22.150> little

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
fingers but I feel mechanic with little

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.969 
fingers but I feel mechanic with little
hands<00:01:22.540> you<00:01:22.720> probably<00:01:22.990> get<00:01:23.110> very<00:01:23.290> successful

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
hands you probably get very successful

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.830 
hands you probably get very successful
with<00:01:24.100> this<00:01:24.280> all<00:01:25.210> right<00:01:27.150> yeah<00:01:28.150> now<00:01:28.450> I'm<00:01:28.600> at<00:01:28.720> the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
belt here I'm going to try to get it

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.340 
belt here I'm going to try to get it
around<00:01:31.450> the<00:01:31.780> UM<00:01:32.070> AC<00:01:33.070> compressor<00:01:33.580> down<00:01:33.970> there

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
around the UM AC compressor down there

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.609 
around the UM AC compressor down there
this<00:01:35.350> is<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:35.649> power<00:01:35.890> steering<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:38.350> around

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
this is the power steering and around

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.499 
this is the power steering and around
the<00:01:38.680> tension<00:01:38.830> pulley<00:01:38.950> and<00:01:39.310> then<00:01:39.520> around<00:01:40.360> the

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
the tension pulley and then around the

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:41.910 
the tension pulley and then around the
crankshaft<00:01:40.810> back<00:01:41.200> over<00:01:41.440> there<00:01:41.560> we'll<00:01:41.710> see<00:01:41.740> if

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
crankshaft back over there we'll see if

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.100 
crankshaft back over there we'll see if
we<00:01:42.040> do<00:01:42.160> it<00:01:42.220> this<00:01:42.580> is<00:01:42.759> very<00:01:43.060> hard<00:01:43.330> to<00:01:43.420> get<00:01:43.990> in

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
we do it this is very hard to get in

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.160 
we do it this is very hard to get in
here<00:01:44.320> -<00:01:44.850> I'll<00:01:45.850> see<00:01:46.060> we<00:01:46.210> can<00:01:46.330> make<00:01:46.450> happen<00:01:46.570> I<00:01:46.930> had

to take my coat off out here in the cold
because<00:01:49.810> my<00:01:50.140> hand<00:01:50.350> can't<00:01:50.560> fit<00:01:50.740> down<00:01:50.860> there

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
because my hand can't fit down there

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.719 
because my hand can't fit down there
with<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.190> coat<00:01:51.340> over<00:01:51.520> so<00:01:51.850> we'll<00:01:52.030> see
