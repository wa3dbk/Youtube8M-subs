going to be a project and I'm going to
obviously<00:00:27.020> make<00:00:27.320> it<00:00:27.500> a<00:00:27.590> one<00:00:28.189> of<00:00:28.279> my<00:00:28.369> super

look at what you're doing don't rush
into<00:00:41.450> it<00:00:41.630> and<00:00:42.220> you'll<00:00:43.220> come<00:00:43.370> out<00:00:43.489> of<00:00:43.640> sight

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
into it and you'll come out of sight

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.910 
into it and you'll come out of sight
looking<00:00:44.150> pretty<00:00:44.390> cool<00:00:44.630> so<00:00:45.320> look<00:00:45.470> at<00:00:45.590> this<00:00:45.710> you

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
looking pretty cool so look at this you

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.550 
looking pretty cool so look at this you
know<00:00:46.040> it's<00:00:46.250> a<00:00:46.340> snot<00:00:46.610> it's<00:00:47.000> a<00:00:47.090> Rotter<00:00:47.330> it's<00:00:48.320> just

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:48.560 
know it's a snot it's a Rotter it's just

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.920 
know it's a snot it's a Rotter it's just
a<00:00:48.650> dumpster<00:00:49.160> but<00:00:50.060> we<00:00:50.240> can<00:00:50.390> make<00:00:50.420> something<00:00:50.720> out

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
a dumpster but we can make something out

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.550 
a dumpster but we can make something out
of<00:00:50.960> it<00:00:51.140> I<00:00:52.390> thought<00:00:53.390> I'd<00:00:53.510> try<00:00:53.540> novick<00:00:53.930> you<00:00:54.440> know

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:54.560 
of it I thought I'd try novick you know

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.800 
of it I thought I'd try novick you know
just<00:00:54.710> a<00:00:54.770> show<00:00:54.950> round<00:00:55.220> see<00:00:55.430> what's<00:00:55.640> what<00:00:56.600> sort

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:56.810 
just a show round see what's what sort

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.060 
just a show round see what's what sort
of<00:00:56.870> problems<00:00:57.290> and<00:00:57.410> issues<00:00:57.470> that<00:00:57.680> I<00:00:57.830> come

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
of problems and issues that I come

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.740 
of problems and issues that I come
across<00:00:58.100> all<00:00:58.490> the<00:00:58.580> time<00:00:58.790> well<00:00:59.330> honest<00:00:59.570> have<00:00:59.690> a

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
across all the time well honest have a

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.140 
across all the time well honest have a
look<00:00:59.870> at<00:00:59.960> this<00:01:00.050> this<00:01:00.890> is<00:01:01.280> a<00:01:01.490> no-no<00:01:01.970> from<00:01:02.840> ear<00:01:04.150> to

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
look at this this is a no-no from ear to

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.840 
look at this this is a no-no from ear to
hear<00:01:05.570> it<00:01:05.869> should<00:01:06.110> be<00:01:06.259> a<00:01:06.290> frame<00:01:06.590> rail<00:01:06.829> but<00:01:07.640> some

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
hear it should be a frame rail but some

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.030 
hear it should be a frame rail but some
lazy<00:01:08.090> git<00:01:08.509> is<00:01:08.689> cut<00:01:08.960> it<00:01:09.079> out<00:01:09.259> because<00:01:09.710> you<00:01:09.920> can

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
lazy git is cut it out because you can

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.280 
lazy git is cut it out because you can
take<00:01:10.189> the<00:01:10.310> motor<00:01:10.520> out<00:01:10.659> or<00:01:11.659> at<00:01:11.840> least<00:01:12.020> take<00:01:12.259> the

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
take the motor out or at least take the

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.679 
take the motor out or at least take the
valve<00:01:12.619> cover<00:01:12.920> off<00:01:13.130> to<00:01:13.369> adjust<00:01:13.729> tappets<00:01:14.540> and

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
valve cover off to adjust tappets and

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.149 
valve cover off to adjust tappets and
stuff<00:01:14.930> which<00:01:15.619> you<00:01:15.710> don't<00:01:15.829> need<00:01:16.009> to<00:01:16.130> worry

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
stuff which you don't need to worry

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.569 
stuff which you don't need to worry
about<00:01:16.490> but<00:01:17.619> you've<00:01:18.619> lost<00:01:18.799> all<00:01:19.009> the<00:01:19.100> stability

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579 
about but you've lost all the stability

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.279 
about but you've lost all the stability
and<00:01:19.609> rigidity<00:01:19.909> which<00:01:20.210> is<00:01:20.539> a<00:01:20.569> hard<00:01:20.810> word<00:01:20.990> to<00:01:21.020> say

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
and rigidity which is a hard word to say

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.800 
and rigidity which is a hard word to say
of<00:01:21.979> your<00:01:22.280> frame<00:01:22.490> so<00:01:23.090> it's<00:01:23.240> basically

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
of your frame so it's basically

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.289 
of your frame so it's basically
like<00:01:23.990> that<00:01:24.049> so<00:01:24.499> that<00:01:25.280> I<00:01:25.310> have<00:01:25.490> to<00:01:25.609> be<00:01:25.729> salt

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
like that so that I have to be salt

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.679 
like that so that I have to be salt
without<00:01:26.390> Andrey<00:01:26.780> welded<00:01:27.170> ok<00:01:28.389> next<00:01:29.389> things

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
without Andrey welded ok next things

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:31.690 
without Andrey welded ok next things
likely<00:01:30.350> this<00:01:30.499> wasn't<00:01:30.770> it<00:01:30.889> isn't<00:01:31.249> too<00:01:31.429> bad<00:01:31.639> but

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
likely this wasn't it isn't too bad but

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.779 
likely this wasn't it isn't too bad but
I<00:01:31.939> haven't<00:01:32.119> seen<00:01:32.420> yet<00:01:32.659> any<00:01:33.560> wire<00:01:34.280> harness

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
I haven't seen yet any wire harness

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:37.179 
I haven't seen yet any wire harness
that's<00:01:35.210> not<00:01:35.479> being<00:01:35.960> around<00:01:36.109> with<00:01:36.380> for

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
that's not being around with for

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.609 
that's not being around with for
instance<00:01:37.249> does<00:01:37.759> have<00:01:37.909> a<00:01:37.939> look<00:01:38.149> well<00:01:38.840> we<00:01:39.469> can

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
instance does have a look well we can

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.899 
instance does have a look well we can
see<00:01:39.799> it<00:01:40.069> and<00:01:40.969> we<00:01:41.149> haven't<00:01:41.359> have<00:01:41.479> a<00:01:41.509> look<00:01:42.909> there

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
see it and we haven't have a look there

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.239 
see it and we haven't have a look there
you<00:01:44.030> go<00:01:44.209> there's<00:01:44.509> a<00:01:44.569> better<00:01:44.689> look<00:01:44.959> so<00:01:45.859> exposed

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:46.249 
you go there's a better look so exposed

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:47.949 
you go there's a better look so exposed
wires<00:01:46.579> well<00:01:46.969> there's<00:01:47.240> a<00:01:47.299> red<00:01:47.509> wire<00:01:47.719> there

00:01:47.949 --> 00:01:47.959 
wires well there's a red wire there

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:49.330 
wires well there's a red wire there
shouldn't<00:01:48.229> be<00:01:48.259> there<00:01:48.619> and<00:01:48.889> there's<00:01:49.249> another

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
shouldn't be there and there's another

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.830 
shouldn't be there and there's another
red<00:01:49.729> wire<00:01:49.909> that<00:01:50.060> shouldn't<00:01:50.389> be<00:01:50.479> there<00:01:50.659> and

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
red wire that shouldn't be there and

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.590 
red wire that shouldn't be there and
this<00:01:50.929> one's<00:01:51.399> this<00:01:52.399> one's<00:01:52.459> all<00:01:52.850> taped<00:01:53.090> up<00:01:53.299> look

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
this one's this one's all taped up look

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.919 
this one's this one's all taped up look
so<00:01:54.590> that's<00:01:55.520> an<00:01:55.670> issue<00:01:55.789> follow<00:01:56.329> it<00:01:56.509> up<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:56.779> wire

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
so that's an issue follow it up the wire

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:01.450 
so that's an issue follow it up the wire
harness<00:01:57.200> and<00:01:58.159> he'll<00:01:58.399> be<00:01:58.490> gathered<00:01:58.819> more<00:01:59.810> crap

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
harness and he'll be gathered more crap

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.730 
harness and he'll be gathered more crap
so<00:02:02.210> yes<00:02:03.580> the<00:02:04.580> classic<00:02:04.970> case<00:02:05.150> look<00:02:05.360> at<00:02:05.450> that

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
so yes the classic case look at that

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.990 
so yes the classic case look at that
yeah<00:02:06.740> if<00:02:06.860> i<00:02:06.950> just<00:02:07.130> type<00:02:07.310> it<00:02:07.520> up<00:02:07.610> at<00:02:07.790> a<00:02:07.820> bill

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
yeah if i just type it up at a bill

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.080 
yeah if i just type it up at a bill
right<00:02:08.240> when<00:02:08.479> it<00:02:09.369> so<00:02:10.369> obviously<00:02:10.729> wasn't<00:02:10.940> a

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
right when it so obviously wasn't a

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.699 
right when it so obviously wasn't a
rocket<00:02:11.450> scientist<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:12.080> other<00:02:12.200> thing<00:02:12.440> i<00:02:12.530> get

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
rocket scientist the other thing i get

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.800 
rocket scientist the other thing i get
an<00:02:12.830> issue<00:02:12.950> a<00:02:13.100> lot<00:02:13.310> is<00:02:13.490> my<00:02:14.209> ignition<00:02:14.450> switch

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
an issue a lot is my ignition switch

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.480 
an issue a lot is my ignition switch
keeps<00:02:15.140> buggering<00:02:15.560> up<00:02:15.650> why<00:02:15.830> is<00:02:15.890> that<00:02:16.010> what'd<00:02:16.459> I

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
keeps buggering up why is that what'd I

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.430 
keeps buggering up why is that what'd I
tell<00:02:16.670> you<00:02:16.790> why<00:02:16.940> may<00:02:17.150> use<00:02:17.900> your<00:02:17.930> ignition

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
tell you why may use your ignition

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.949 
tell you why may use your ignition
switch<00:02:18.830> sits<00:02:19.280> on<00:02:19.459> here<00:02:19.730> and<00:02:20.060> then<00:02:20.480> some<00:02:20.720> people

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
switch sits on here and then some people

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.270 
switch sits on here and then some people
think<00:02:21.110> oh<00:02:21.290> I<00:02:21.319> can't<00:02:21.709> be<00:02:21.770> bothered<00:02:21.800> to<00:02:22.040> bend

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
think oh I can't be bothered to bend

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.130 
think oh I can't be bothered to bend
over<00:02:22.400> just<00:02:22.819> to<00:02:22.910> turn<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.270> ignition<00:02:23.840> switch

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
over just to turn the ignition switch

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.449 
over just to turn the ignition switch
ons<00:02:24.500> you<00:02:24.620> know<00:02:24.739> what<00:02:24.920> I'll<00:02:25.069> stretch<00:02:25.280> the

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
ons you know what I'll stretch the

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.040 
ons you know what I'll stretch the
bollocks<00:02:25.790> out<00:02:25.910> of<00:02:26.060> it<00:02:26.180> and<00:02:26.600> i'll<00:02:26.720> put<00:02:26.900> it<00:02:26.989> up

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
bollocks out of it and i'll put it up

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.600 
bollocks out of it and i'll put it up
here<00:02:27.200> on<00:02:27.350> the<00:02:27.440> end<00:02:27.590> of<00:02:27.709> ours<00:02:27.890> well<00:02:28.489> that's

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
here on the end of ours well that's

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.010 
here on the end of ours well that's
precisely<00:02:28.970> what<00:02:29.209> happens<00:02:29.510> it<00:02:29.630> stretches<00:02:29.989> the

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
precisely what happens it stretches the

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.780 
precisely what happens it stretches the
bollocks<00:02:30.530> out<00:02:30.709> of<00:02:30.860> it<00:02:30.980> so<00:02:31.220> you<00:02:31.250> keep<00:02:31.580> turning

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
bollocks out of it so you keep turning

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.729 
bollocks out of it so you keep turning
left<00:02:32.150> right<00:02:32.540> left<00:02:32.870> it<00:02:33.140> pulls<00:02:33.410> against

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
left right left it pulls against

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.920 
left right left it pulls against
underneath<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.430> bottom<00:02:34.610> on<00:02:35.269> the<00:02:35.450> connector

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
underneath the bottom on the connector

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.070 
underneath the bottom on the connector
and<00:02:36.530> eventually<00:02:37.040> will<00:02:37.420> break<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.570> solder<00:02:38.930> and

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
and eventually will break the solder and

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.590 
and eventually will break the solder and
then<00:02:39.320> no<00:02:39.590> ignition<00:02:40.209> so<00:02:41.209> they're<00:02:41.360> just<00:02:41.450> the

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
then no ignition so they're just the

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.240 
then no ignition so they're just the
basic<00:02:41.959> fundamentals<00:02:42.470> that<00:02:42.530> I<00:02:42.680> always<00:02:42.830> find

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
basic fundamentals that I always find

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.250 
basic fundamentals that I always find
that<00:02:43.430> it<00:02:43.580> go<00:02:43.700> actually<00:02:44.420> taken<00:02:44.930> out<00:02:45.050> on<00:02:45.170> the

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
that it go actually taken out on the

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.610 
that it go actually taken out on the
bike<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:45.680> have<00:02:46.160> been<00:02:46.310> abused<00:02:47.410> usual<00:02:48.410> stuff

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
bike and have been abused usual stuff

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.509 
bike and have been abused usual stuff
like<00:02:48.830> that<00:02:49.209> is<00:02:50.209> like<00:02:50.269> this<00:02:50.690> and<00:02:51.019> bits<00:02:51.980> miss<00:02:52.250> in

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
like that is like this and bits miss in

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.810 
like that is like this and bits miss in
a<00:02:53.709> general<00:02:54.709> snotter<00:02:55.040> you<00:02:55.340> know<00:02:55.459> the<00:02:55.640> motor

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
a general snotter you know the motor

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.610 
a general snotter you know the motor
overall<00:02:56.330> is<00:02:56.570> there<00:02:56.900> but<00:02:57.110> our<00:02:57.280> needs<00:02:58.280> some<00:02:58.400> TLC

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
overall is there but our needs some TLC

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.750 
overall is there but our needs some TLC
so<00:03:00.620> what<00:03:00.739> I'm<00:03:00.830> going<00:03:00.950> to<00:03:01.040> basically<00:03:01.370> on<00:03:01.580> this

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
so what I'm going to basically on this

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.809 
so what I'm going to basically on this
particular<00:03:02.510> build<00:03:02.989> is<00:03:03.370> show<00:03:04.370> you<00:03:04.430> what<00:03:04.640> I<00:03:04.670> do

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
particular build is show you what I do

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.240 
particular build is show you what I do
and<00:03:05.500> see<00:03:06.500> if<00:03:06.560> it's<00:03:06.680> going<00:03:06.799> to<00:03:06.890> be<00:03:06.950> any<00:03:07.100> good

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
and see if it's going to be any good

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:19.440 
and see if it's going to be any good
fulfillment<00:03:07.760> if<00:03:07.820> not<00:03:08.030> shove<00:03:08.660> it<00:03:08.780> up<00:03:08.870> your<00:03:08.900> ass

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.510 

you
