00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.140 

just<00:02:55.319> think<00:02:55.890> stack<00:02:56.190> them<00:02:56.400> on<00:02:56.519> top<00:02:56.579> of<00:02:56.970> each

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
just think stack them on top of each

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.920 
just think stack them on top of each
other<00:02:57.950> so<00:02:58.950> if<00:02:59.099> he<00:02:59.250> wants<00:02:59.579> to<00:02:59.610> he<00:03:00.480> never<00:03:00.690> even

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
other so if he wants to he never even

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.970 
other so if he wants to he never even
dies<00:03:01.260> but<00:03:01.590> if<00:03:01.739> he<00:03:01.860> wants<00:03:02.099> to<00:03:02.190> get<00:03:02.370> up<00:03:02.519> and<00:03:03.030> bask

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
dies but if he wants to get up and bask

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.940 
dies but if he wants to get up and bask
again<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:05.970> last<00:03:06.120> thing<00:03:06.450> I<00:03:06.599> have<00:03:06.900> is<00:03:07.380> this

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
again and the last thing I have is this

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.500
