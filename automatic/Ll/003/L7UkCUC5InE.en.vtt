battery<00:00:26.029> now<00:00:27.029> on<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.930> assembly<00:00:28.380> on<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:28.680> i

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
battery now on the assembly on this i

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.069 
battery now on the assembly on this i
found<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.990> tailwheel<00:00:31.550> was<00:00:32.550> very<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.910> lose

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
found that tailwheel was very to lose

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.350 
found that tailwheel was very to lose
its<00:00:34.079> mounted<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.500> rudder<00:00:34.969> and<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.149> came

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
its mounted to the rudder and you came

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.479 
its mounted to the rudder and you came
right<00:00:36.510> off<00:00:36.540> my<00:00:36.840> hand<00:00:37.110> so<00:00:37.860> what<00:00:37.980> i<00:00:38.010> did<00:00:38.100> was<00:00:38.280> i

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
right off my hand so what i did was i

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.959 
right off my hand so what i did was i
use<00:00:38.670> some<00:00:39.620> gorilla<00:00:40.620> glue<00:00:40.890> he<00:00:41.280> was<00:00:41.520> very<00:00:41.670> little

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
use some gorilla glue he was very little

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.209 
use some gorilla glue he was very little
gorilla<00:00:42.809> glue<00:00:43.050> because<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.500> expands<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.100> lot

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
gorilla glue because it expands a lot

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.150 
gorilla glue because it expands a lot
and<00:00:44.430> i<00:00:44.520> clamped<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.030> until<00:00:45.690> tried<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.320> that

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
and i clamped it until tried and that

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.150 
and i clamped it until tried and that
solved<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.640> problem<00:00:48.710> now<00:00:49.710> with<00:00:50.039> this

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
solved that problem now with this

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.470 
solved that problem now with this

playing particular plane do not flight
without<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.809> flying<00:00:55.079> wings<00:00:55.320> because<00:00:55.890> if<00:00:56.129> you

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
without the flying wings because if you

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.270 
without the flying wings because if you
do<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.449> start<00:00:57.719> doing<00:00:57.870> loops<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:59.070> will

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
do and you start doing loops you will

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.000 
do and you start doing loops you will
pull<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.820> wing<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.020> wings<00:01:01.379> will<00:01:01.590> pull<00:01:01.890> up

found<00:01:05.610> what<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.119> needed<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.950> little<00:01:07.950> bit

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
found what this is needed a little bit

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.060 
found what this is needed a little bit
more<00:01:08.430> down<00:01:08.820> thrust<00:01:09.270> but<00:01:10.140> besides<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.710> it

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
more down thrust but besides that it

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.190 
more down thrust but besides that it
feel<00:01:11.939> very<00:01:11.970> well<00:01:12.450> now<00:01:13.380> landing<00:01:14.010> i<00:01:14.189> landed<00:01:15.200> high

grass and it bent though just one side
of<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.759> landing<00:01:21.119> here<00:01:21.360> which<00:01:21.659> was<00:01:21.990> no<00:01:22.140> big

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
of the landing here which was no big

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
used foam safe zap on it and it was fine

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.920 
used foam safe zap on it and it was fine
the<00:01:33.930> other<00:01:34.049> thing<00:01:34.290> was<00:01:35.329> the<00:01:36.329> wheels<00:01:36.570> are<00:01:36.810> only

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
the other thing was the wheels are only

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.330 
the other thing was the wheels are only
held<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.670> with<00:01:38.689> tubing<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.960> on<00:01:40.560> landing<00:01:40.979> on<00:01:41.100> I

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
held in with tubing and on landing on I

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.880 
held in with tubing and on landing on I
would<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.659> wheels<00:01:42.840> came<00:01:43.140> off<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.619> what<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:43.829> did

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
would the wheels came off so what I did

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.859 
would the wheels came off so what I did
was<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.250> put<00:01:44.329> the<00:01:45.329> Dubrow<00:01:45.780> 3<00:01:46.380> 30<00:01:46.619> seconds<00:01:47.869> Lock

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
was I put the Dubrow 3 30 seconds Lock

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.440 
was I put the Dubrow 3 30 seconds Lock
collars<00:01:49.320> on<00:01:49.500> here<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.189> it's<00:01:51.119> not<00:01:51.180> going<00:01:51.360> to

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
collars on here and it's not going to

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
collars on here and it's not going to
come<00:01:51.540> off<00:01:51.720> it'll<00:01:52.590> stay<00:01:52.770> on<00:01:53.000> but<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.659> plane<00:01:55.110> has

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
come off it'll stay on but the plane has

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.510 
come off it'll stay on but the plane has
really<00:01:56.399> good<00:01:56.549> flying<00:01:56.850> characteristics<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:58.520> I

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
really good flying characteristics and I

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.330 
really good flying characteristics and I
recommend<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.689> beginner<00:02:01.100> but<00:02:02.100> on

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
recommend it to the beginner but on

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.429 
recommend it to the beginner but on
assembly<00:02:03.000> on<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.509> have<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.200> watch<00:02:04.409> that

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
assembly on this you have to watch that

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.850 
assembly on this you have to watch that
your<00:02:04.920> throws<00:02:05.670> on<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.409> transmitter<00:02:07.409> or<00:02:07.590> right

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
your throws on a transmitter or right

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.080 
your throws on a transmitter or right
like<00:02:08.550> on<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.759> elevator<00:02:09.590> they<00:02:10.590> were<00:02:10.649> up

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
like on the elevator they were up

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.660 
like on the elevator they were up
same<00:02:12.930> with<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.230> air<00:02:13.319> loans<00:02:13.560> right<00:02:14.160> was<00:02:14.400> left

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
same with the air loans right was left

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.059 
same with the air loans right was left
so<00:02:14.879> make<00:02:15.150> sure<00:02:15.180> that<00:02:15.739> directions<00:02:16.739> aren't

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
so make sure that directions aren't

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.160 
so make sure that directions aren't
correct<00:02:17.519> before<00:02:17.849> you<00:02:18.150> even<00:02:18.720> attempt<00:02:19.140> to

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
correct before you even attempt to
