hi and welcome back to thai hobby review

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.260 
hi and welcome back to thai hobby review
on<00:00:19.880> youtube<00:00:20.390> today<00:00:21.170> we<00:00:21.380> have<00:00:21.860> the<00:00:22.250> Air<00:00:22.820> Hogs

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
on youtube today we have the Air Hogs

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.510 
on youtube today we have the Air Hogs
Jet<00:00:23.960> Set<00:00:24.700> I<00:00:25.869> call<00:00:26.869> it<00:00:27.020> the<00:00:27.200> futuristic<00:00:28.130> plane

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 
Jet Set I call it the futuristic plane

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:34.210 
Jet Set I call it the futuristic plane
and<00:00:30.070> it<00:00:31.070> comes<00:00:31.340> with<00:00:31.489> two<00:00:31.669> spare<00:00:33.220> propellers

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
and it comes with two spare propellers

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:40.060 
and it comes with two spare propellers
and<00:00:36.940> the<00:00:37.940> controller<00:00:38.420> which<00:00:38.899> requires<00:00:39.560> six

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
and the controller which requires six

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.330 
and the controller which requires six
AAA<00:00:40.370> batteries<00:00:41.270> the<00:00:41.450> Tarzi<00:00:41.989> charges<00:00:42.770> in<00:00:43.040> about

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
AAA batteries the Tarzi charges in about

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.069 
AAA batteries the Tarzi charges in about
30<00:00:43.760> minutes<00:00:44.300> and<00:00:45.370> the<00:00:46.370> controller<00:00:47.079> operates

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
30 minutes and the controller operates

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.860 
30 minutes and the controller operates
off<00:00:48.379> a<00:00:48.519> 2.4<00:00:49.539> gigahertz<00:00:50.710> frequency<00:00:51.710> and<00:00:52.660> it's<00:00:53.660> a

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
off a 2.4 gigahertz frequency and it's a

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.380 
off a 2.4 gigahertz frequency and it's a
dual<00:00:55.149> prop<00:00:56.149> plane<00:00:56.769> which<00:00:57.769> means<00:00:58.100> it'll<00:00:58.789> spend

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
dual prop plane which means it'll spend

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.169 
dual prop plane which means it'll spend
one<00:00:59.690> prop<00:01:00.050> more<00:01:00.499> than<00:01:00.890> the<00:01:01.100> other<00:01:01.309> depending

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:02.179 
one prop more than the other depending

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:05.740 
one prop more than the other depending
on<00:01:02.390> which<00:01:02.690> way<00:01:02.989> you<00:01:03.050> turn<00:01:04.180> when<00:01:05.180> you're<00:01:05.330> going

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
on which way you turn when you're going

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.470 
on which way you turn when you're going
straight<00:01:05.990> they<00:01:06.590> should<00:01:06.890> be<00:01:07.159> it<00:01:07.480> equal

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:08.480 
straight they should be it equal

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.310 
straight they should be it equal
momentum<00:01:09.820> but<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:11.030> turn<00:01:11.330> one<00:01:11.810> will<00:01:12.050> sustain

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
momentum but the turn one will sustain

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.870 
momentum but the turn one will sustain
to<00:01:12.980> slide<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:14.690> airplane<00:01:15.290> around<00:01:15.640> to<00:01:16.640> one

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
to slide the the airplane around to one

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.870 
to slide the the airplane around to one
direction<00:01:17.090> and<00:01:17.720> the<00:01:17.870> other<00:01:18.080> will<00:01:18.380> spend<00:01:18.770> a<00:01:18.979> lot

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
direction and the other will spend a lot

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.999 
direction and the other will spend a lot
around<00:01:20.299> to<00:01:20.659> the<00:01:20.869> opposite<00:01:21.560> direction<00:01:23.770> it<00:01:24.770> does

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
around to the opposite direction it does

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.499 
around to the opposite direction it does
look<00:01:25.369> promising<00:01:25.790> I<00:01:26.420> hope<00:01:26.600> it<00:01:26.840> flies<00:01:27.020> good<00:01:28.509> but

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
look promising I hope it flies good but

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.050 
look promising I hope it flies good but
I<00:01:29.990> guess<00:01:30.200> we'll<00:01:30.619> have<00:01:30.770> to<00:01:30.829> see<00:01:31.280> so<00:01:31.700> how<00:01:31.939> about

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
I guess we'll have to see so how about

00:01:32.060 --> 00:04:20.930 
I guess we'll have to see so how about
some<00:01:32.509> flight<00:01:32.840> foot

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.909 

okay<00:04:21.940> so<00:04:22.000> wrap<00:04:22.360> to<00:04:22.720> wrap<00:04:22.750> up<00:04:23.110> the<00:04:23.259> review<00:04:23.680> on

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
okay so wrap to wrap up the review on

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.189 
okay so wrap to wrap up the review on
the<00:04:23.949> Jet<00:04:24.280> Set<00:04:24.310> I<00:04:24.789> call<00:04:25.300> it<00:04:25.449> the<00:04:25.569> futuristic

fully<00:04:33.190> well<00:04:34.410> you<00:04:35.410> have<00:04:35.620> to<00:04:35.830> launch<00:04:36.039> it<00:04:36.340> you

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:36.819 
fully well you have to launch it you

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:38.790 
fully well you have to launch it you
can't<00:04:37.090> launch<00:04:37.270> it<00:04:37.479> in<00:04:37.569> a<00:04:37.660> straight<00:04:37.960> line<00:04:37.990> it'll

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
can't launch it in a straight line it'll

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.409 
can't launch it in a straight line it'll
lose<00:04:39.099> too<00:04:39.250> much<00:04:39.400> altitude<00:04:39.610> and<00:04:40.090> just<00:04:40.240> laying

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
lose too much altitude and just laying

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.510 
lose too much altitude and just laying
on<00:04:40.599> the<00:04:40.720> ground<00:04:40.990> but<00:04:41.740> if<00:04:41.860> you<00:04:41.979> launch<00:04:42.190> it<00:04:42.400> at

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
on the ground but if you launch it at

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.550 
on the ground but if you launch it at
some<00:04:42.729> one<00:04:42.789> other<00:04:43.030> angle<00:04:43.240> into<00:04:43.840> the<00:04:43.960> wind

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
some one other angle into the wind

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.010 
some one other angle into the wind
you<00:04:45.099> came<00:04:45.340> once<00:04:45.849> you<00:04:45.970> get<00:04:46.120> enough<00:04:46.330> altitude<00:04:46.569> i

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
you came once you get enough altitude i

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.749 
you came once you get enough altitude i
recommending<00:04:47.650> trying<00:04:48.160> to<00:04:48.280> get<00:04:48.430> a<00:04:48.460> lot<00:04:48.639> of

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:48.759 
recommending trying to get a lot of

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:50.640 
recommending trying to get a lot of
altitude<00:04:48.910> where<00:04:49.509> you<00:04:49.599> start<00:04:49.870> turning<00:04:50.080> on<00:04:50.349> this

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
altitude where you start turning on this

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.700 
altitude where you start turning on this
one<00:04:51.000> the<00:04:52.000> only<00:04:52.300> problem<00:04:52.720> was<00:04:52.870> that<00:04:52.930> i<00:04:53.199> think<00:04:53.380> my

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
one the only problem was that i think my

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.529 
one the only problem was that i think my
controller<00:04:54.250> is<00:04:54.580> a<00:04:54.610> little<00:04:54.970> bit<00:04:55.090> of<00:04:55.210> a<00:04:55.330> lemon

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:55.539 
controller is a little bit of a lemon

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:57.779 
controller is a little bit of a lemon
and<00:04:56.050> you<00:04:56.199> may<00:04:56.470> not<00:04:56.650> have<00:04:56.860> this<00:04:57.070> problem<00:04:57.190> and

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:57.789 
and you may not have this problem and

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:00.210 
and you may not have this problem and
may<00:04:57.910> just<00:04:58.120> be<00:04:58.360> my<00:04:58.539> controller<00:04:58.990> but<00:04:59.650> i<00:04:59.680> did<00:04:59.919> cut

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
may just be my controller but i did cut

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.439 
may just be my controller but i did cut
out<00:05:00.370> a<00:05:00.400> couple<00:05:00.820> times<00:05:01.150> i<00:05:01.449> had<00:05:01.630> to<00:05:01.660> reset<00:05:02.199> it<00:05:03.449> but

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449 
out a couple times i had to reset it but

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:06.749 
out a couple times i had to reset it but
when<00:05:04.990> it<00:05:05.110> worked<00:05:05.320> it<00:05:05.560> worked<00:05:05.710> do<00:05:05.949> it<00:05:06.130> and<00:05:06.490> it

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:06.759 
when it worked it worked do it and it

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:10.140 
when it worked it worked do it and it
does<00:05:06.970> go<00:05:07.210> pretty<00:05:07.240> high<00:05:07.720> and<00:05:08.050> it's<00:05:08.820> got<00:05:09.820> enough

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
does go pretty high and it's got enough

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.939 
does go pretty high and it's got enough
left<00:05:10.449> it<00:05:10.930> could<00:05:11.080> have<00:05:11.259> a<00:05:11.289> little<00:05:11.590> bit<00:05:11.680> more

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949 
left it could have a little bit more

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:14.790 
left it could have a little bit more
that's<00:05:12.580> why<00:05:12.789> I<00:05:12.820> launched<00:05:13.330> it<00:05:13.509> up<00:05:13.630> up<00:05:14.470> in<00:05:14.740> the

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
that's why I launched it up up in the

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.379 
that's why I launched it up up in the
air<00:05:14.979> towards<00:05:15.310> the<00:05:15.520> wind<00:05:15.759> and<00:05:16.030> full<00:05:16.210> throttle

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
air towards the wind and full throttle

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:19.409 
air towards the wind and full throttle
until<00:05:16.960> you<00:05:17.169> get<00:05:17.349> some<00:05:17.500> altitude<00:05:17.819> but<00:05:18.819> I<00:05:19.270> do

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
until you get some altitude but I do

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:23.040 
until you get some altitude but I do
recommend<00:05:19.960> it<00:05:20.849> and<00:05:21.849> I<00:05:22.270> think<00:05:22.330> it<00:05:22.599> was<00:05:22.750> a<00:05:22.780> great

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
recommend it and I think it was a great

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.740 
recommend it and I think it was a great
great<00:05:23.680> buy<00:05:23.889> I<00:05:24.280> was<00:05:24.789> able<00:05:24.909> to<00:05:25.060> get<00:05:25.180> mine<00:05:25.360> to<00:05:25.539> fly
