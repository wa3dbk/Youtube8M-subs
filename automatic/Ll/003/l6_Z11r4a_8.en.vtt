00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.719 
you have to be very careful on this part
because<00:02:04.500> your<00:02:04.679> twist<00:02:04.920> can<00:02:05.130> come<00:02:05.369> out<00:02:05.520> very

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
because your twist can come out very

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.669 
because your twist can come out very
easily<00:02:05.880> if<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.659> don't<00:02:06.780> hold<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.319> right<00:02:07.469> and

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
easily if you don't hold it right and

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:09.380 
easily if you don't hold it right and
this<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.190> difficult<00:02:08.369> for<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:08.940> can<00:02:09.209> always

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
this is difficult for you you can always

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.119 
this is difficult for you you can always
just<00:02:09.599> rubberband<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.470> then<00:02:10.649> braid<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.039> and

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
just rubberband it and then braid it and

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.320 
just rubberband it and then braid it and
cut<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.400> rubber<00:02:11.670> band<00:02:11.879> out<00:02:12.030> with<00:02:12.209> some

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
cut the rubber band out with some

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.500 
cut the rubber band out with some
scissors<00:02:13.519> so<00:02:14.519> I'm<00:02:14.760> going<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.000> split<00:02:15.120> my<00:02:15.209> twist

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
scissors so I'm going to split my twist

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:25.640 
scissors so I'm going to split my twist
into<00:02:15.690> three<00:02:15.959> sections

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:43.300 

and<00:02:26.099> then<00:02:26.310> I'm<00:02:26.430> going<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.670> begin<00:02:27.180> braiding

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310

when you're braiding only break down to

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.349 
when you're braiding only break down to
about<00:02:46.290> where<00:02:47.099> your<00:02:47.280> collarbone<00:02:47.819> is<00:02:48.000> because

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
about where your collarbone is because

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:49.729 
about where your collarbone is because
that's<00:02:48.569> where<00:02:48.810> she<00:02:48.840> wears<00:02:49.109> it<00:02:49.230> in<00:02:49.349> the<00:02:49.469> movie

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
that's where she wears it in the movie

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.170 
that's where she wears it in the movie
