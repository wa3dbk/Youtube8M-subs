00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.940 
full-back nailed it in and just
went<00:02:05.420> right<00:02:05.600> in<00:02:05.780> and<00:02:05.810> they<00:02:06.500> moved<00:02:06.740> pretty

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
went right in and they moved pretty

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.040 
went right in and they moved pretty
quickly<00:02:07.160> the<00:02:07.910> work<00:02:08.120> involved<00:02:08.450> was<00:02:08.750> getting

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
quickly the work involved was getting

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.630 
quickly the work involved was getting
the<00:02:09.140> full<00:02:09.350> back<00:02:09.560> right<00:02:09.590> but<00:02:10.070> once<00:02:10.250> you<00:02:10.369> got<00:02:10.520> the

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
the full back right but once you got the

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.890 
the full back right but once you got the
first<00:02:10.850> couple<00:02:11.090> of<00:02:11.360> rows<00:02:12.790> level<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:13.970> set<00:02:14.360> again

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
first couple of rows level and set again

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.480 
first couple of rows level and set again
that<00:02:15.080> was<00:02:15.260> fairly<00:02:15.530> easy<00:02:15.650> because<00:02:16.130> everything

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
that was fairly easy because everything

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.970 
that was fairly easy because everything
locks<00:02:16.730> into<00:02:17.000> each<00:02:17.270> other<00:02:17.510> I<00:02:17.750> find<00:02:18.620> this<00:02:18.770> to<00:02:18.950> be

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
locks into each other I find this to be

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.820 
locks into each other I find this to be
a<00:02:19.130> tremendous<00:02:19.610> product<00:02:20.300> I<00:02:20.450> love<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.350> idea<00:02:21.740> of

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
a tremendous product I love the idea of

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.920 
a tremendous product I love the idea of
not<00:02:22.070> having<00:02:22.460> a<00:02:22.550> hollow<00:02:22.820> behind<00:02:23.330> my<00:02:23.510> finished

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
not having a hollow behind my finished

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.590 
not having a hollow behind my finished
siding<00:02:24.440> or<00:02:24.620> hardiplank<00:02:25.490> or<00:02:25.880> whenever<00:02:26.270> I'm

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
siding or hardiplank or whenever I'm

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.540 
siding or hardiplank or whenever I'm
going<00:02:26.750> to<00:02:26.810> put<00:02:26.960> on<00:02:27.080> there<00:02:27.260> and<00:02:27.530> I<00:02:28.130> just<00:02:28.340> think

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
going to put on there and I just think

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.870 
going to put on there and I just think
that<00:02:28.640> it's<00:02:28.940> a<00:02:30.280> technologically<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:31.430> great

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
that it's a technologically a great

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.880 
that it's a technologically a great
project<00:02:32.180> moving<00:02:32.690> forward<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:33.440> it's

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
project moving forward and it's

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.560 
project moving forward and it's
something<00:02:34.100> I'm<00:02:34.400> really<00:02:34.430> looking<00:02:35.150> forward<00:02:35.180> to

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
something I'm really looking forward to

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.450 
something I'm really looking forward to
using<00:02:35.720> in<00:02:35.990> the<00:02:36.110> future<00:02:36.470> for<00:02:36.950> virtually

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
using in the future for virtually

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:44.170 
using in the future for virtually
everything<00:02:38.000> that<00:02:38.390> we<00:02:38.510> put<00:02:38.750> on<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:38.930> walls

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.830 

what<00:02:44.840> we<00:02:44.989> did<00:02:45.230> was<00:02:45.260> is<00:02:45.769> we<00:02:46.370> wanted<00:02:46.730> to<00:02:46.939> put<00:02:47.810> a

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
what we did was is we wanted to put a

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.099 
what we did was is we wanted to put a
lineal<00:02:48.409> which<00:02:49.010> is<00:02:49.250> a<00:02:49.280> wider<00:02:49.909> version<00:02:50.390> of<00:02:50.780> a<00:02:50.870> J

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:51.109 
lineal which is a wider version of a J

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:53.410 
lineal which is a wider version of a J
channel<00:02:51.590> so<00:02:52.010> that<00:02:52.040> there<00:02:52.400> is<00:02:52.519> a<00:02:52.549> bold<00:02:52.969> look

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
channel so that there is a bold look

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.599 
channel so that there is a bold look
around<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:53.989> window<00:02:54.379> which<00:02:54.920> gives<00:02:55.250> it<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.459> nice

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609
