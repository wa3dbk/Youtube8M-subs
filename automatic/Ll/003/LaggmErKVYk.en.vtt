and<00:00:15.809> that's<00:00:15.990> an<00:00:16.080> area<00:00:16.199> that<00:00:16.320> he's<00:00:16.529> improved<00:00:16.859> in

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
and that's an area that he's improved in

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.680 
and that's an area that he's improved in
rapidly<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.430> think<00:00:17.699> over<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.029> past<00:00:18.240> few<00:00:18.420> years

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
rapidly I think over the past few years

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.439 
rapidly I think over the past few years
he<00:00:19.470> wasn't<00:00:19.710> back<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.039> basket<00:00:20.160> player<00:00:20.550> in

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
he wasn't back to the basket player in

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:22.970 
he wasn't back to the basket player in
high<00:00:21.600> school<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:22.289> know<00:00:22.380> he's<00:00:22.529> always<00:00:22.769> the

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
high school you know he's always the

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.279 
high school you know he's always the
biggest<00:00:23.160> strongest<00:00:23.400> guy<00:00:23.699> around<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.289> he's

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
biggest strongest guy around and he's

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.960 
biggest strongest guy around and he's
developed<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.680> pretty<00:00:25.830> nice<00:00:26.070> face-up<00:00:26.519> game<00:00:26.699> I

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
developed a pretty nice face-up game I

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.490 
developed a pretty nice face-up game I
believe<00:00:27.029> he<00:00:27.269> shot<00:00:27.420> about<00:00:27.660> forty<00:00:27.930> percent<00:00:27.960> from

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
believe he shot about forty percent from

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.169 
believe he shot about forty percent from
three<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:28.859> year<00:00:28.920> although<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:30.060> was

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
three this year although that was

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.690 
three this year although that was
unlimited<00:00:30.449> attempts<00:00:31.219> we're<00:00:32.219> not<00:00:32.340> sure<00:00:32.550> yet

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
unlimited attempts we're not sure yet

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.060 
unlimited attempts we're not sure yet
bill<00:00:32.940> we<00:00:33.480> hope<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:33.840> he<00:00:34.050> plays<00:00:34.290> but<00:00:34.649> but<00:00:34.920> you

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
bill we hope that he plays but but you

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.680 
bill we hope that he plays but but you
know<00:00:35.160> we<00:00:35.370> just<00:00:35.640> called<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.940> pic<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.600> we

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
know we just called the pic in so we

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.819 
know we just called the pic in so we
haven't<00:00:36.960> had<00:00:37.050> at<00:00:37.170> least<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.530> haven't<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.800> chance

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
haven't had at least I haven't a chance

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.770 
haven't had at least I haven't a chance
to<00:00:38.190> speak<00:00:38.280> with<00:00:38.430> Jared<00:00:38.910> or<00:00:39.000> his<00:00:39.120> agent<00:00:39.420> about

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
to speak with Jared or his agent about

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:51.439 
to speak with Jared or his agent about
where<00:00:39.930> he<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.079> right<00:00:40.230> now<00:00:50.120> no<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.149> don't<00:00:51.390> think

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
where he is right now no I don't think

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.020 
where he is right now no I don't think
so<00:00:52.129> you<00:00:53.129> know<00:00:53.219> fab<00:00:53.399> grew<00:00:53.550> up<00:00:53.640> as<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.760> soccer

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
so you know fab grew up as a soccer

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.450 
so you know fab grew up as a soccer
player<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:54.539> Brazil<00:00:54.960> he's<00:00:55.860> coming<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.340> game

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
player in Brazil he's coming to the game

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.299 
player in Brazil he's coming to the game
a<00:00:56.489> little<00:00:56.699> late<00:00:57.140> I<00:00:58.140> thought<00:00:58.770> he<00:00:58.890> struggled

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
a little late I thought he struggled

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.160 
a little late I thought he struggled
some<00:00:59.550> his<00:00:59.730> freshman<00:01:00.120> year<00:01:00.149> at<00:01:00.480> Syracuse<00:01:00.899> and

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
some his freshman year at Syracuse and

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.529 
some his freshman year at Syracuse and
then<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:01.920> thought<00:01:02.039> he<00:01:02.430> improved<00:01:02.760> rapidly<00:01:03.030> this

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
then I thought he improved rapidly this

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.450 
then I thought he improved rapidly this
year<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.619> their<00:01:04.739> coaches<00:01:05.070> gave<00:01:05.250> him<00:01:05.339> great

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
year and their coaches gave him great

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.660 
year and their coaches gave him great
reviews<00:01:06.409> his<00:01:07.409> difference<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.280> difference<00:01:08.310> in

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
reviews his difference the difference in

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.920 
reviews his difference the difference in
their<00:01:08.790> team<00:01:08.970> when<00:01:09.180> he<00:01:09.240> was<00:01:09.360> on<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.720> off<00:01:09.750> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
their team when he was on and off the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.679 
their team when he was on and off the
court<00:01:09.960> was<00:01:10.650> fairly<00:01:10.860> significant<00:01:11.600> like<00:01:12.600> I

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
court was fairly significant like I

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.000 
court was fairly significant like I
mentioned<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:13.020> minute<00:01:13.140> ago<00:01:13.229> he's<00:01:13.680> one<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.920> the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
mentioned a minute ago he's one of the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.410 
mentioned a minute ago he's one of the
few<00:01:14.220> guys<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.610> country<00:01:14.909> who<00:01:15.030> can<00:01:15.180> block

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
few guys in the country who can block

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.510 
few guys in the country who can block
shots<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.049> take<00:01:16.259> charges<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:17.340> he's<00:01:17.460> a

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
shots and take charges so he's a

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.910 
shots and take charges so he's a
defensive<00:01:17.729> presence<00:01:18.060> right<00:01:18.360> now<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.810> we<00:01:19.770> also

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
defensive presence right now and we also

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.440 
defensive presence right now and we also
think<00:01:20.220> he's<00:01:20.430> an<00:01:20.520> over-the-top<00:01:20.880> threat<00:01:21.330> on

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
think he's an over-the-top threat on

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.330 
think he's an over-the-top threat on
lobs<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.080> he's<00:01:22.380> able<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.619> step<00:01:22.860> out<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.070> make

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
lobs and he's able to step out and make

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.570 
lobs and he's able to step out and make
15<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.000> 17<00:01:24.330> foot<00:01:24.509> jumpers<00:01:25.070> we<00:01:26.070> think<00:01:26.430> that's

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
15 to 17 foot jumpers we think that's

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.580 
15 to 17 foot jumpers we think that's
very<00:01:26.670> important<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.900> know<00:01:27.990> we<00:01:28.110> feel<00:01:28.470> like

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
went in a great situation you know

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.910

they're<00:02:26.100> kind<00:02:26.310> of<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.490> young<00:02:26.670> up-and-coming

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
they're kind of a young up-and-coming

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.230 
they're kind of a young up-and-coming
team<00:02:27.360> so<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.430> you'd<00:02:29.430> have<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.670> ask<00:02:29.760> doc<00:02:30.000> but<00:02:30.150> I

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
team so I you'd have to ask doc but I

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.370 
team so I you'd have to ask doc but I
think<00:02:30.450> that's<00:02:30.600> a<00:02:30.660> place<00:02:30.840> they<00:02:30.960> really<00:02:31.200> want

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
think that's a place they really want

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.890 
think that's a place they really want
him<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.590> go<00:02:31.740> and<00:02:32.490> and<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:33.060> I<00:02:33.240> you<00:02:33.480> know<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.600> got

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
lose two pics just to get one guy who we

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.880 
lose two pics just to get one guy who we
might<00:03:13.920> have<00:03:14.070> rated<00:03:14.400> slightly<00:03:14.850> higher<00:03:15.030> and<00:03:15.890> you

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
might have rated slightly higher and you

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.400 
might have rated slightly higher and you
know<00:03:16.980> we<00:03:17.130> had<00:03:17.459> jarrod<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:18.150> fab<00:03:18.660> created<00:03:19.260> very

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
know we had jarrod and fab created very

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.920 
know we had jarrod and fab created very
highly<00:03:19.709> so<00:03:20.370> in<00:03:20.760> retrospect<00:03:21.239> it<00:03:21.750> would<00:03:21.840> have

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
highly so in retrospect it would have

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.660 
highly so in retrospect it would have
been<00:03:21.989> a<00:03:22.050> shame<00:03:22.110> if<00:03:22.440> we<00:03:22.500> traded<00:03:22.830> two<00:03:22.950> pics<00:03:23.190> and

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
been a shame if we traded two pics and

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.100 
been a shame if we traded two pics and
just<00:03:23.910> got<00:03:24.120> one<00:03:24.269> of<00:03:24.360> those<00:03:24.420> guys<00:03:24.660> instead<00:03:24.989> of

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
just got one of those guys instead of

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.770 
just got one of those guys instead of
getting<00:03:25.320> both<00:03:25.440> of<00:03:25.470> them<00:03:26.450> more<00:03:27.450> questions
