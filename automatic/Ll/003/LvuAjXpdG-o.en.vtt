00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.860
 well the first week are always the 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.220
 tougher I think those activities 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.130
 of the month it shows and well the team is 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.510
 working well we are still few there 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:31.060
 exercises that good we have to 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.410
 that the people who do it I hope 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.660
 but good, waiting for more 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.630
 people waiting to look forward to 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.780
 to start the year and good to have 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.780
 liquidate 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.310
 good every coach has his way of 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.840
 work now the ministry is 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.800
 trying hard the ball we are doing 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.670
 a lot of short game combinative game and 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.830
 we are basically doing that 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.790
 obviously physically, because we do not 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:06.820
 we give not because that contact to a human 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.560
 it is missed and I think that the 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.470
 comparison is that each coach has 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.350
 his way of working we have 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:17.400
 that adapt to this and good to go with the 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.400
 Mr 100% 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.830
 if that helps help a lot because 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.160
 because you are evolving with the rest 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.260
 of the team do not enter do not enter there 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.660
 when other colleagues are already 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.630
 But I think this year started better 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:39.280
 And I think how good you'll start the 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.280
 year much better than last year 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.890
 well lucas takes only one day 

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:48.350
 see but you see that it has quality looks 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.109
 that has a speed and good basin and 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.969
 canella are already some bad we have welcomed 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:55.280
 as if they were from the family and 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:57.709
 good for the moment has opened us a lot 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.850
 good mojo to party I hope but already the 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:01.209
 we know and we know that they are good 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.209
 players 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.200
 good the Greek league excepting the 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.400
 six teams up is the teams of 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.840
 up I think they could participate in 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.819
 first division perfectly but yes 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.879
 it's true that the teams below are 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.290
 of less level obviously is not the 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.269
 worth division here but neither 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.120
 second I think it would be a term 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.730
 medium good doing well in payment 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.319
 which is a big club in greece and good 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.480
 let's hope that here he continues he comes with 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.140
 very excited and hopefully contribute 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.140
 things 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.760
 in no time to think about going out in 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:05.260
 I'm 100% focused on sport 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.110
 I have more hope than any year in my 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.520
 career I think it's an important year 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.070
 for me 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.680
 good is the inch the opportunity to 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.770
 go back to first and I want you to throw it out 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.060
 I want to show that I can play and good 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.690
 like everyone trying to win the job 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.690
 of the first day 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.390
 if I invite, I think they will still come 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.570
 almost all the lines will come signings and 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.000
 well imagine that up and well 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.850
 to win the job I think it's the 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.710
 every year bread we have to fight 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:48.070
 the first day convince everyone to his 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:50.710
 way to coach and well imagine that 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:53.740
 both borja and rudy they will want 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:56.080
 stay with as much as me and everyone 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.740
 will fight to its form and will try to convince 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.740
 to habits 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.329
 well I last year in the 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.790
 preseason was not I do not know I do not know who 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.500
 he did it but the kids very well 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.470
 Alvaro has surprised me a lot 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.870
 yesterday he was very good with a player 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.610
 a lot of quality with a lot of young clubs that 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.110
 is I think he knows what he plays 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:36.080
 and well the other is strong is not slobber 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.880
 all and good they will try the same not 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.300
 yes I believe that now those moments of 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.930
 that each one give everything to convince and 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.930
 to stay 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.840
 well what I have clear that at 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.000
 sports will earn you in budget but 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.600
 what they will not win us is in illusion 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.690
 and I think that if we have illusion all the 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.760
 team and the fans I think it's 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.920
 good that the sports one has to be 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.780
 half of the table because it's somewhere else 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:29.800
 but the year is very long it is very soon 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:31.000
 to predict anything and good what 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.930
 that I have said with enthusiasm and with desire 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.820
 I think we can have a nice year 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.220
 at least not to worry 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.000
 intention not then in the last ten 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.630
 journeys 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.700
 from here you know that passive 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:48.280
 to fight to be up the eight 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.570
 first or in the end nothing I think the 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.790
 sporting has to go step by step and 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.620
 Focus first on the objective 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:57.990
 main salvation is then 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.990
 I think I can not close doors 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:00.830
 all right
