this are the volume controls we've got a

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.540 
this are the volume controls we've got a
13<00:01:27.500> megapixel<00:01:27.710> camera<00:01:28.490> on<00:01:28.670> be<00:01:29.360> LG<00:01:29.690> g2<00:01:30.020> and<00:01:30.550> this

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
13 megapixel camera on be LG g2 and this

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.960 
13 megapixel camera on be LG g2 and this
is<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:32.090> time<00:01:32.360> where<00:01:32.660> the<00:01:32.900> Xperia<00:01:33.530> z1<00:01:34.490> comes<00:01:34.760> in

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
is the time where the Xperia z1 comes in

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.080 
is the time where the Xperia z1 comes in
we've<00:01:35.510> got<00:01:35.890> all<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:37.100> usual<00:01:37.430> buttons<00:01:37.790> we've

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
we've got all the usual buttons we've

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.380 
we've got all the usual buttons we've
got<00:01:38.300> a<00:01:38.330> camera<00:01:39.260> shutter<00:01:39.770> button<00:01:40.100> on<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:41.180> right

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
got a camera shutter button on the right

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.040 
got a camera shutter button on the right
side<00:01:41.690> and<00:01:42.310> we've<00:01:43.310> also<00:01:43.580> got<00:01:43.970> a<00:01:44.240> better<00:01:44.750> camera

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
side and we've also got a better camera

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.110 
side and we've also got a better camera
so<00:01:45.620> this<00:01:45.770> is<00:01:45.860> a<00:01:46.180> 20.7<00:01:47.180> megapixel<00:01:47.870> sensor<00:01:48.380> with

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 
so this is a 20.7 megapixel sensor with

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.240 
so this is a 20.7 megapixel sensor with
1<00:01:50.120> /<00:01:51.040> 2.3<00:01:52.040> inches<00:01:53.259> off<00:01:54.259> sighs<00:01:54.590> so<00:01:54.860> this<00:01:55.040> is<00:01:55.160> a

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
1 / 2.3 inches off sighs so this is a

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.870 
1 / 2.3 inches off sighs so this is a
bigger<00:01:55.490> sensor<00:01:56.200> but<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.440> the<00:01:58.369> advantage<00:01:58.759> of

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
bigger sensor but the the advantage of

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.950 
bigger sensor but the the advantage of
the<00:01:59.030> g2<00:01:59.509> is<00:01:59.750> definitely<00:02:00.710> that<00:02:00.920> video<00:02:01.700> is<00:02:01.960> yeah

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
the g2 is definitely that video is yeah

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.230 
the g2 is definitely that video is yeah
smoother<00:02:03.530> due<00:02:04.100> to<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:04.460> optical<00:02:04.970> image

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
smoother due to the optical image

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.930 
smoother due to the optical image
stabilization<00:02:05.660> and<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:07.040> Sony<00:02:07.280> Xperia<00:02:07.399> that

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
stabilization and the Sony Xperia that

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.449 
stabilization and the Sony Xperia that
one<00:02:08.119> only<00:02:08.600> has<00:02:08.860> software<00:02:09.860> image

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
one only has software image

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.000 
one only has software image
stabilization<00:02:11.090> which<00:02:11.600> also<00:02:12.110> works<00:02:12.500> pretty

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
stabilization which also works pretty

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.620 
stabilization which also works pretty
neat<00:02:13.340> but<00:02:13.820> still<00:02:14.150> it's<00:02:14.420> not<00:02:14.780> optical<00:02:15.670> so<00:02:16.670> yeah

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
neat but still it's not optical so yeah

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.830 
neat but still it's not optical so yeah
this<00:02:17.930> is<00:02:18.260> a<00:02:18.320> big<00:02:18.709> difference<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.280> also<00:02:19.840> the

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
this is a big difference and also the

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.870 
this is a big difference and also the
sizes<00:02:21.320> one<00:02:21.500> difference<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.640> build

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
sizes one difference and the build

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.100 
sizes one difference and the build
quality<00:02:23.060> LG<00:02:23.989> g2<00:02:24.380> has<00:02:24.680> a<00:02:25.160> beautiful<00:02:26.110> glass

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
quality LG g2 has a beautiful glass

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.820 
quality LG g2 has a beautiful glass
panel<00:02:27.709> on<00:02:27.799> the<00:02:27.920> front<00:02:27.950> but<00:02:28.459> then<00:02:28.700> it<00:02:29.180> gets<00:02:29.480> very

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
panel on the front but then it gets very

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.330 
panel on the front but then it gets very
plasticky<00:02:30.830> ok<00:02:31.160> it<00:02:31.310> looks<00:02:31.340> ok<00:02:32.530> sort<00:02:33.530> of<00:02:33.680> carbon

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
plasticky ok it looks ok sort of carbon

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.750 
plasticky ok it looks ok sort of carbon
like<00:02:35.080> carbon<00:02:36.080> fiber<00:02:36.410> but<00:02:37.010> it's<00:02:37.160> so<00:02:37.340> plastic

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
like carbon fiber but it's so plastic

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
panel on the back which feels very rigid

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.650 
panel on the back which feels very rigid
and

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
and

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.260 
and
really<00:02:50.660> very<00:02:51.080> well<00:02:51.550> very<00:02:52.550> well<00:02:52.700> very<00:02:53.090> well

really very well very well very well

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.430 
really very well very well very well
built<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.890> bezel<00:02:55.280> here<00:02:55.760> the<00:02:56.750> frame<00:02:57.080> is<00:02:57.349> made

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
built the bezel here the frame is made

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.699 
built the bezel here the frame is made
completely<00:02:58.190> out<00:02:58.640> of<00:02:58.819> aluminum<00:02:59.690> it<00:03:00.230> feels<00:03:00.590> very

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
completely out of aluminum it feels very

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.570 
completely out of aluminum it feels very
solid<00:03:01.130> although<00:03:02.120> it's<00:03:02.390> also<00:03:03.050> on<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:04.280> heavier

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
solid although it's also on the heavier

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.160 
solid although it's also on the heavier
side<00:03:04.670> so<00:03:05.150> we<00:03:05.270> experience<00:03:05.660> that<00:03:05.780> one<00:03:05.930> is<00:03:06.140> a

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
side so we experience that one is a

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.150 
side so we experience that one is a
little<00:03:06.440> bit<00:03:06.590> more<00:03:07.220> heavy<00:03:07.489> but<00:03:08.060> still<00:03:08.330> it<00:03:08.510> feels

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
little bit more heavy but still it feels

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.490 
little bit more heavy but still it feels
very<00:03:10.160> well<00:03:10.400> built<00:03:10.640> and<00:03:10.940> definitely<00:03:11.690> it<00:03:12.230> is<00:03:12.380> an

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
very well built and definitely it is an

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.630 
very well built and definitely it is an
advantage<00:03:13.420> for<00:03:14.420> we<00:03:14.569> experience<00:03:15.170> at<00:03:15.319> one<00:03:15.640> so

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
advantage for we experience at one so

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.710 
advantage for we experience at one so
yeah<00:03:16.849> it's<00:03:17.060> major<00:03:18.250> LG<00:03:19.250> g2<00:03:19.670> lies<00:03:20.209> better<00:03:20.480> in<00:03:20.599> the

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
yeah it's major LG g2 lies better in the

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.740 
yeah it's major LG g2 lies better in the
hand<00:03:20.959> it's<00:03:21.799> a<00:03:22.010> little<00:03:22.250> bit<00:03:22.400> lighter<00:03:22.670> but<00:03:23.450> still

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
hand it's a little bit lighter but still

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.100 
hand it's a little bit lighter but still
we<00:03:24.049> experience<00:03:24.830> that<00:03:24.950> one<00:03:25.190> wins<00:03:25.489> on<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:26.110> build

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
we experience that one wins on the build

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.509 
we experience that one wins on the build
quality<00:03:27.260> side<00:03:27.739> both<00:03:28.549> have<00:03:28.730> a<00:03:28.959> snapdragon<00:03:30.519> 800

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
fair so you see both devices are very

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.360 
fair so you see both devices are very
snappy<00:04:09.500> very<00:04:10.280> fast

feel<00:04:13.000> great<00:04:13.269> we've<00:04:13.959> got<00:04:14.200> a<00:04:14.470> free<00:04:15.159> thousand

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
feel great we've got a free thousand

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.599 
feel great we've got a free thousand
million<00:04:15.760> power<00:04:15.970> battery<00:04:16.000> on<00:04:16.810> both<00:04:17.139> phones<00:04:17.609> but

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
million power battery on both phones but

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.550 
million power battery on both phones but
we<00:04:18.910> experience<00:04:19.540> that<00:04:19.690> one<00:04:19.930> has<00:04:20.139> a<00:04:20.169> stamina

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
we experience that one has a stamina

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.310 
we experience that one has a stamina
mode<00:04:20.949> which<00:04:21.340> i<00:04:21.609> think<00:04:22.150> the<00:04:22.270> LG<00:04:22.540> g2<00:04:22.690> doesn't

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
mode which i think the LG g2 doesn't

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.159 
mode which i think the LG g2 doesn't
have<00:04:23.530> and<00:04:24.300> let's<00:04:25.300> take<00:04:25.449> a<00:04:25.510> look<00:04:25.720> at<00:04:25.780> it<00:04:25.900> so<00:04:26.050> this

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
have and let's take a look at it so this

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:31.670 
have and let's take a look at it so this
is<00:04:26.290> German<00:04:26.650> it<00:04:26.979> says<00:04:27.190> 22<00:04:27.550> hours<00:04:27.970> of<00:04:29.460> yeah<00:04:30.460> of

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
is German it says 22 hours of yeah of

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.650 
is German it says 22 hours of yeah of
operating<00:04:32.680> time<00:04:32.970> remaining<00:04:33.970> with

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
operating time remaining with

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.680 
operating time remaining with
thirty-seven<00:04:35.530> percent<00:04:36.100> of<00:04:36.669> battery<00:04:37.180> left<00:04:37.360> and

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
thirty-seven percent of battery left and

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.950 
thirty-seven percent of battery left and
if<00:04:38.440> we<00:04:38.620> put<00:04:38.860> it<00:04:39.010> in<00:04:39.130> stamina<00:04:39.460> mode<00:04:39.850> you'll<00:04:40.600> see

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
if we put it in stamina mode you'll see

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.430 
if we put it in stamina mode you'll see
it<00:04:41.470> just<00:04:41.710> doubles<00:04:42.190> so<00:04:42.940> this<00:04:43.570> should<00:04:43.840> be<00:04:44.050> the

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
it just doubles so this should be the

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.750 
it just doubles so this should be the
winner<00:04:45.310> in<00:04:45.690> battery<00:04:46.690> life<00:04:47.160> but<00:04:48.160> still<00:04:48.490> both

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
winner in battery life but still both

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.340 
winner in battery life but still both
are<00:04:48.940> great<00:04:49.389> devices<00:04:51.270> pricing<00:04:52.270> will<00:04:52.449> be<00:04:52.660> nearly

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
are great devices pricing will be nearly

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.860 
are great devices pricing will be nearly
the<00:04:53.560> same<00:04:53.830> and<00:04:54.160> we<00:04:54.970> experience<00:04:55.389> that<00:04:55.510> one<00:04:55.690> has

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
the same and we experience that one has

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.080 
the same and we experience that one has
one<00:04:56.260> more<00:04:56.440> advantage<00:04:56.710> and<00:04:57.070> this<00:04:57.190> is<00:04:57.340> the<00:04:57.460> micro

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
one more advantage and this is the micro

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.500 
one more advantage and this is the micro
SD<00:04:58.389> card<00:04:58.660> slot<00:04:58.990> so<00:04:59.229> you<00:04:59.590> can<00:05:00.340> have<00:05:00.669> it<00:05:00.940> with<00:05:01.150> 16

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
SD card slot so you can have it with 16

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.840 
SD card slot so you can have it with 16
gigabytes<00:05:01.870> of<00:05:02.139> memory<00:05:02.620> and<00:05:02.949> then<00:05:03.460> just<00:05:03.669> put<00:05:03.820> a

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
gigabytes of memory and then just put a

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.950 
gigabytes of memory and then just put a
64<00:05:04.510> gigabyte<00:05:04.870> microSD<00:05:05.380> card<00:05:05.860> and<00:05:06.100> you<00:05:07.060> have<00:05:07.240> 80

which<00:05:31.630> is<00:05:31.660> the<00:05:31.930> winner<00:05:32.169> the<00:05:33.010> display<00:05:33.370> and

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
which is the winner the display and

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.150 
which is the winner the display and
little<00:05:33.729> GG<00:05:34.030> to<00:05:34.210> is<00:05:34.330> better<00:05:34.570> i<00:05:35.320> think<00:05:36.039> the

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
little GG to is better i think the

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.080 
little GG to is better i think the
camera<00:05:36.490> only<00:05:36.610> that<00:05:37.030> one<00:05:37.270> should<00:05:37.599> be<00:05:37.630> better

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
camera only that one should be better

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.659 
camera only that one should be better
battery<00:05:40.090> wise<00:05:40.300> with<00:05:40.720> zone<00:05:40.930> is<00:05:41.080> that<00:05:41.289> one<00:05:41.669> will

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
battery wise with zone is that one will

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:45.510 
battery wise with zone is that one will
probably<00:05:43.270> win<00:05:43.479> as<00:05:43.750> well<00:05:43.780> so<00:05:44.349> why<00:05:45.160> don't<00:05:45.370> you
