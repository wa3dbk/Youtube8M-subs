00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:55.830 
because I don't want to smudge and I've
been<00:01:52.840> using<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:54.250> bridge<00:01:54.850> when<00:01:55.149> I'm<00:01:55.270> working

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
been using a bridge when I'm working

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.950 
been using a bridge when I'm working
over<00:01:56.140> on<00:01:56.289> that<00:01:56.560> side<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:58.210> I<00:01:58.240> can<00:01:58.509> come<00:01:58.750> in<00:01:58.930> and

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
over on that side so I can come in and

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.920 
over on that side so I can come in and
really<00:01:59.430> squeeze<00:02:00.430> the<00:02:00.789> eraser<00:02:01.119> and<00:02:01.570> make<00:02:01.780> it

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
really squeeze the eraser and make it

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.050 
really squeeze the eraser and make it
really<00:02:02.259> skinny<00:02:02.799> and<00:02:03.009> I'm<00:02:03.490> looking<00:02:03.789> at<00:02:03.909> my

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
really skinny and I'm looking at my

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.679 
really skinny and I'm looking at my
reference<00:02:04.329> and<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:06.369> can<00:02:06.820> pull<00:02:07.090> some<00:02:07.329> stuff<00:02:07.539> out

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
reference and I can pull some stuff out

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.020 
reference and I can pull some stuff out
it's<00:02:07.810> a<00:02:07.840> little<00:02:08.050> bit<00:02:08.140> more<00:02:08.320> tedious<00:02:08.860> but<00:02:09.130> you

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
it's a little bit more tedious but you

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.850 
it's a little bit more tedious but you
know<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.270> point<00:02:10.720> is<00:02:10.899> is<00:02:11.170> you<00:02:11.320> don't<00:02:11.350> want<00:02:11.740> to

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
know the point is is you don't want to

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.660 
know the point is is you don't want to
you<00:02:12.010> overuse<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:13.000> eraser<00:02:13.540> okay<00:02:14.020> I<00:02:14.260> think<00:02:14.890> you

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
you overuse the eraser okay I think you

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.550 
you overuse the eraser okay I think you
know<00:02:15.760> less<00:02:16.090> is<00:02:16.330> best<00:02:16.600> and<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:16.990> want<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.320> really

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
know less is best and you want to really

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.380 
know less is best and you want to really
save<00:02:18.040> your<00:02:18.220> lights<00:02:18.460> you<00:02:18.700> want<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.060> kind<00:02:19.240> of

save your lights you want to kind of

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.500 
save your lights you want to kind of

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
painter would save the white of the

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.319 
painter would save the white of the
