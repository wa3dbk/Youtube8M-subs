00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
put the lemon line I'm sure you think

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.450 
put the lemon line I'm sure you think
about<00:01:28.969> like<00:01:29.270> this<00:01:32.289> yeah<00:01:33.289> it's<00:01:33.829> really<00:01:34.009> good

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
about like this yeah it's really good

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.209 
about like this yeah it's really good
don't<00:01:34.729> think<00:01:34.969> it's<00:01:35.090> worth<00:01:35.240> it<00:01:35.420> now<00:01:35.539> and<00:01:36.530> this

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:37.219 
don't think it's worth it now and this

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:39.639 
don't think it's worth it now and this
is<00:01:37.340> the<00:01:37.399> paradox<00:01:37.759> you<00:01:38.090> can't<00:01:38.539> buy<00:01:38.689> it<00:01:38.750> once<00:01:39.439> two

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
is the paradox you can't buy it once two

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:40.660 
is the paradox you can't buy it once two
hours<00:01:39.829> because<00:01:40.009> that's<00:01:40.219> not<00:01:40.340> worth<00:01:40.520> two

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
hours because that's not worth two

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.580 
hours because that's not worth two
dollars<00:01:40.700> but<00:01:41.270> once<00:01:41.420> work<00:01:41.600> dollar<00:01:41.930> and<00:01:42.469> it's

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
dollars but once work dollar and it's

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.249 
dollars but once work dollar and it's
old<00:01:42.860> and<00:01:43.700> you<00:01:43.880> can't<00:01:44.090> even<00:01:44.210> it<00:01:44.420> doesn't<00:01:45.109> matter

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
old and you can't even it doesn't matter

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:46.480 
old and you can't even it doesn't matter
how<00:01:45.350> much<00:01:45.469> cost<00:01:45.770> I<00:01:45.920> can't<00:01:46.130> eat<00:01:46.219> it

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
how much cost I can't eat it

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.789 
how much cost I can't eat it
I<00:01:46.520> would<00:01:47.420> Sully<00:01:47.600> with<00:01:47.780> a<00:01:47.810> three<00:01:48.049> I<00:01:48.289> love<00:01:48.680> the

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
I would Sully with a three I love the

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:50.740 
I would Sully with a three I love the
idea<00:01:49.130> and<00:01:49.460> I<00:01:49.939> love<00:01:50.149> everything<00:01:50.359> about<00:01:50.509> it

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
idea and I love everything about it

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.209 
idea and I love everything about it
other<00:01:50.869> than<00:01:50.960> the<00:01:51.170> price<00:01:51.439> but<00:01:51.740> you<00:01:51.829> do<00:01:51.979> have<00:01:52.100> to

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:52.219 
other than the price but you do have to

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:54.039 
other than the price but you do have to
get<00:01:52.310> these<00:01:52.460> one<00:01:52.640> or<00:01:52.759> two<00:01:52.880> bucks<00:01:53.090> because<00:01:53.329> if<00:01:53.509> if

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
get these one or two bucks because if if

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.889 
get these one or two bucks because if if
you<00:01:54.259> don't<00:01:54.469> it's<00:01:55.219> a<00:01:55.280> big<00:01:55.430> waste<00:01:55.609> of<00:01:55.729> time<00:01:55.899> but

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
you don't it's a big waste of time but
