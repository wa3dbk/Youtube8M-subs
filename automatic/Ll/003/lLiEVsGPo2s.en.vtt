is the fact that you have the ability to

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.190 
is the fact that you have the ability to
look<00:00:32.550> around<00:00:32.790> while<00:00:33.000> you're<00:00:33.120> driving<00:00:33.600> it

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
really shows you how truly realistic the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.299 
really shows you how truly realistic the
simulation<00:00:37.350> can<00:00:37.559> be<00:00:37.739> pushed<00:00:37.980> from<00:00:38.219> the

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
simulation can be pushed from the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.970 
simulation can be pushed from the
visions<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.300> driver<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:39.960> as<00:00:40.620> soon<00:00:40.739> as<00:00:40.800> I

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
visions of the driver so as soon as I

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.650 
visions of the driver so as soon as I
put<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.309> disk<00:00:41.520> in<00:00:41.820> knowing<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.570> was

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
put this disk in knowing that it was

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.479 
put this disk in knowing that it was
neat<00:00:42.870> for<00:00:42.899> Speed<00:00:43.290> game<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.530> kind<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.129> had<00:00:44.280> these

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
neat for Speed game I kind of had these

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.459 
neat for Speed game I kind of had these
pre<00:00:44.730> assumptions<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.960> game<00:00:46.200> might<00:00:46.440> not

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
pre assumptions that the game might not

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.130 
pre assumptions that the game might not
be<00:00:46.680> what<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.520> know<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.670> want<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.300> be<00:00:48.450> however

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
be what you know I want it to be however

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.510 
be what you know I want it to be however
as<00:00:49.320> soon<00:00:49.379> as<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.680> started<00:00:49.950> playing<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.340> game

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
as soon as I started playing the game

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.569 
as soon as I started playing the game
and<00:00:50.550> realizing<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.420> system<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:51.930> they<00:00:51.960> have

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
and realizing the system that they have

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.100 
and realizing the system that they have
with<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.789> upgrading<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.719> they've<00:00:54.870> done<00:00:55.050> a

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
with you upgrading and they've done a

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.750 
with you upgrading and they've done a
really<00:00:55.350> slow<00:00:55.680> progression<00:00:56.100> which<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.520> really

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
really slow progression which is really

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.180 
really slow progression which is really
great<00:00:56.969> for<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.510> learn<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.840> game<00:00:58.190> over

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
great for you to learn the game over

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.799 
great for you to learn the game over
time<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.550> start<00:00:59.760> realizing<00:00:59.910> all<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.539> cars

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
time you start realizing all the cars

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:01.849 
time you start realizing all the cars
that<00:01:01.020> are<00:01:01.109> in<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.289> game<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.710> could

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859

the<00:02:23.040> career<00:02:23.340> mode<00:02:23.460> is<00:02:23.610> also<00:02:23.940> fun<00:02:24.180> because<00:02:24.480> it

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
the career mode is also fun because it

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.140 
the career mode is also fun because it
has<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.810> really<00:02:25.140> good<00:02:25.350> leveling<00:02:25.770> system<00:02:26.250> unlike

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
has a really good leveling system unlike

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.300 
has a really good leveling system unlike
dirt<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.600> where<00:02:27.870> you<00:02:27.990> just<00:02:28.140> level<00:02:28.560> up<00:02:28.740> based<00:02:29.130> on

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
dirt to where you just level up based on

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.400 
dirt to where you just level up based on
how<00:02:29.610> well<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:30.060> perform<00:02:30.240> this<00:02:31.080> one<00:02:31.290> actually

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
how well you perform this one actually

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.400 
how well you perform this one actually
has<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:32.420> greater<00:02:33.420> depth<00:02:33.720> into<00:02:34.020> it<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.320> way

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
has a greater depth into it and the way

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.180 
has a greater depth into it and the way
to<00:02:34.440> do<00:02:34.710> it<00:02:34.740> is<00:02:34.950> they<00:02:35.100> split<00:02:35.490> split<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.510> a

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
to do it is they split split to a

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.860 
to do it is they split split to a
statistic<00:02:38.190> sections<00:02:38.700> up<00:02:38.880> basically<00:02:39.420> so<00:02:39.780> you

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
statistic sections up basically so you

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.580 
statistic sections up basically so you
basically<00:02:40.230> have<00:02:40.760> aggression<00:02:42.170> which<00:02:43.170> means<00:02:43.380> if

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
basically have aggression which means if

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.110 
basically have aggression which means if
you<00:02:43.710> you<00:02:43.980> know<00:02:44.010> write<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.340> dirty<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.910> hit

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
you you know write a dirty you hit

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.730 
you you know write a dirty you hit
people<00:02:45.480> you<00:02:45.630> throw<00:02:45.870> people<00:02:46.080> off<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.440> track

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
people you throw people off the track

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.430 
people you throw people off the track
you<00:02:47.190> spend<00:02:47.520> people<00:02:47.790> out<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.870> know<00:02:48.990> you<00:02:49.050> trail

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
you spend people out you know you trail

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.290 
you spend people out you know you trail
somebody<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.100> drift<00:02:50.430> behind<00:02:50.730> somebody<00:02:51.060> all

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
somebody you drift behind somebody all

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.700 
somebody you drift behind somebody all
those<00:02:51.510> are<00:02:51.690> aggression<00:02:52.110> stuff<00:02:52.380> that<00:02:52.590> you

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
those are aggression stuff that you

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.800 
those are aggression stuff that you
could<00:02:52.890> gain<00:02:53.070> throughout<00:02:53.880> you<00:02:54.150> know<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:54.420> races

could gain throughout you know the races

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.930 
could gain throughout you know the races
then<00:02:55.350> there's<00:02:55.560> precision<00:02:56.130> stuff<00:02:56.400> precision

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
then there's precision stuff precision

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.910 
then there's precision stuff precision
