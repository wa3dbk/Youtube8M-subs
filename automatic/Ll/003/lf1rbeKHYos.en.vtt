 I have a way 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.210
 practice of doing it you can put that 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.950
 that here in the pan it puts it 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.140
 directly as if it were a wire it 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.860

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:48.800

 can cover 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.090

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:04.960
