00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.320
 a group of lifeguards performs the 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.960
 vertical rescue of a teenager to 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.430
 point of falling into the jaws of the abyss in 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.430
 the crater of the volcano of san salvador 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.940
 after two hours of hard work the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.210
 Rescuers manage to save this young man 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.960
 of just 15 years to whom an error almost 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.960
 it takes away his life 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.140
 we 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.000
 part of extremes where you established not 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.880
 realized that it was when he left and 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.530
 I want to see three big stones but 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.530
 we thought he had squeezed in 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.480
 the head is as if God himself put 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.729
 those stones there for him to stop 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.740
 had it not been for them the 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.100
 teenager would have fallen fatally 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.710
 at the bottom of the abyss there they were in front 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.970
 he had fallen from it was a very 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.729
 scabrous is a low one where at least 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.480
 we've uploaded it with a lasso there god what 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.820
 saved that was for me 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.520
 and the sidewalks are narrow and the earth 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.400
 it is not safe to walk less to 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.190
 run 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.360
 Well, the recommendations that 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.550
 be careful when they leave 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.710
 They are quite tasty and true to see where 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.710
 they are going to stop and take a guide 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:56.000
 risk their lives to save that of others 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.150
 the rescuers are ready and this time 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.030
 They arrived on time 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.030
