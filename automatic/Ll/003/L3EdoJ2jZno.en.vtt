00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 co-produced with us the vice president of the urban community of strasbourg 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.620
 responsible for the sports in the nose here because of the access on board and sings 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.019
 club is a real building site and we also really see that the plan 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:13.589
 pool started and we are in the bottom 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:17.230
 so this is the first operation after rallying to his niece on the 21st 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.269
 may the kibitzenau 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:21.279
 our pool full plan activity until 2014 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.619
 budget of 42 million euros until 2014 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.279
 it's over 1000 euros overall so can we talk about 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.529
 dilapidated we have worries to highpierre sarr took the water 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.020
 here is that rather organic it dated to 76 you really had to 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:35.480
 make 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.660
 figure the little boy still mentioning the whole establishment were heated 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:39.679
 to electricity 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:41.500
 so new heat pump 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.860
 so energy saving and pillot following then air treatment 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.500
 water treatment for in ponds with amina sister decor in 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.739
 all this has called for modern techniques 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.390
 of energy saving and to europe sustainable development will be one of 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.380
 strong principles 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.930
 we know what we do about a million euros 1 million 300 thousand 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.090
 input 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.650
 denis hours in alsace you already have a first balance up that which is not 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.980
 not this summer with the time we find of course it will be clearly 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.729
 dropped but not for the definitive chipmunks figures but everyone 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.439
 know that the month of July and the month of August 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.899
 has not been one of the hottest recent years of operations has 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:17.659
 so a small drop but overall over a year the numbers 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.179
 are still equivalent a million of all equipment and here 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:26.119
 at osvaldo 90 hours but the annual% entry is one and of course the fact 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.729
 works that started on May 1st it will be a 100 percent year 100 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.780
 you conjure up the climate that's what there is 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.119
 gave rise to this retractable roof pool yes he is at home 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:39.140
 it was 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.540
 the operation but the pools that had decreed the government in the 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.850
 1970s here we are anticipating a sun 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.420
 like other mass equipment i would say sunflower pool ali ben 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.890
 salem with little innovation 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.960
 with them rounded roofs 6 with a roof openable to vernets it was 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.710
 like winter with a novelty even when finished cabins men and women 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.130
 I bet it's been a lot of movement right now 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.140
 the other side has a mix 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.390
 in the locker room and yannick quoted in the mouths but m but in less 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.460
 as the specify 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.600
 he will have individual cabins inside of these 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.770
 of those water showers that people who will want to also isolated 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:20.850
 can they rape 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.180
 he will have a small advantage I I repeat it often could quite 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.059
 concrete 

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:27.739
 I'll go with three little girls 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.430
 that at the pool you can take it directly so in 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.990
 for now keep it with me before he had to 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.739
 hold to his little girl in various surveys he's going 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.650
 you're going to undress in the cabin next door and then I'll join you so it's a 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.209
 happy with an ovation julia but it's done in a lot of countries and we have 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.379
 wanted to make this innovation a point on security I think about it 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.180
 drama in Marseille in a swimming pool 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.510
 a girl is 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.189
 these rents also had among other things you have the past of the instructions of 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:57.370
 pool robot here 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.550
 you're going to reinforce the safety of our troops here the lifeguard in 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.150
 franche-county and safety instructions are to renovate in 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.380
 permanence we have we make a permanent effort 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.770
 the training is illiterate the training of lifeguards 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:11.849
 and I believe that 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.680
 of course we have never been safe from anything but there 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.760
 there the safety of places is a priority I think it is good 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.689
 applied in our institutions
