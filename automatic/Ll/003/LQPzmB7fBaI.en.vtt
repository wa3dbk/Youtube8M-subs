I<00:00:24.779> could<00:00:25.019> see<00:00:25.230> our<00:00:25.350> target<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.849> water<00:00:27.119> was

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
I could see our target the water was

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.820 
I could see our target the water was
darkened<00:00:27.840> by<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:27.960> silt<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.470> have<00:00:28.680> been

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
darkened by the silt that have been

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.710 
darkened by the silt that have been
stirred<00:00:29.160> up<00:00:29.340> by<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.580> rush<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.210> previous

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720

incoming<00:00:31.230> tie<00:00:31.439> as<00:00:31.820> we<00:00:32.820> move<00:00:33.059> closer<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.719> was

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
incoming tie as we move closer it was

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.630 
incoming tie as we move closer it was
obvious<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.590> target<00:00:35.040> was<00:00:35.190> no<00:00:35.370> larger

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
obvious that this target was no larger

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:44.360

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.560 

what<00:01:14.230> kind<00:01:14.500> would<00:01:14.680> remain<00:01:14.950> to<00:01:15.130> be<00:01:15.250> seen<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
what kind would remain to be seen the

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.510 
what kind would remain to be seen the
Allies<00:01:16.720> you<00:01:17.050> had<00:01:17.140> several<00:01:17.470> different<00:01:17.890> types<00:01:18.130> I

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
knew Jim would have the answer but that

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.020 
knew Jim would have the answer but that
would<00:01:20.950> have<00:01:21.070> to<00:01:21.220> wait<00:01:21.370> till<00:01:21.550> we<00:01:21.640> got<00:01:21.790> to<00:01:21.850> the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
would have to wait till we got to the

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.810 
would have to wait till we got to the
surface<00:01:22.360> to<00:01:22.570> find<00:01:22.960> out<00:01:23.460> suddenly<00:01:24.460> the<00:01:24.610> tide

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
surface to find out suddenly the tide

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.240 
surface to find out suddenly the tide
began<00:01:25.120> to<00:01:25.330> move<00:01:25.660> in<00:01:25.960> and<00:01:26.170> in<00:01:26.740> minutes<00:01:27.160> the

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
began to move in and in minutes the

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.950 
began to move in and in minutes the
current<00:01:27.670> was<00:01:27.760> flowing<00:01:27.790> at<00:01:28.240> more<00:01:28.450> than<00:01:28.630> a<00:01:28.750> knot

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
current was flowing at more than a knot

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.310 
current was flowing at more than a knot
and<00:01:29.230> steadily<00:01:29.950> increasing<00:01:30.750> our<00:01:31.750> dive<00:01:31.960> window

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
and steadily increasing our dive window

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.950 
and steadily increasing our dive window
was<00:01:32.500> closing<00:01:32.800> in<00:01:33.190> it<00:01:33.970> was<00:01:34.120> time<00:01:34.390> to<00:01:34.540> get<00:01:34.630> out<00:01:34.690> of

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
was closing in it was time to get out of

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:42.510 
was closing in it was time to get out of

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
evidence of that still much store we can

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.250 
evidence of that still much store we can
go<00:02:24.070> on<00:02:24.220> and<00:02:24.459> look<00:02:25.060> at<00:02:25.239> it<00:02:25.360> on<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:25.480> beach<00:02:25.690> yep<00:02:26.050> so
