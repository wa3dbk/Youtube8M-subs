mess with the registry in some way or

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.160 
mess with the registry in some way or
form<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.250> fashion<00:01:05.760> there's<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.689> free<00:01:06.930> tool

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
form a fashion there's a free tool

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.280 
form a fashion there's a free tool
called<00:01:07.200> hijack<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:09.510> will<00:01:09.750> scan<00:01:10.140> your

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
called hijack this that will scan your

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.350 
called hijack this that will scan your
entire<00:01:10.590> registry<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.340> highlight<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.000> lot<00:01:12.240> of

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
entire registry and highlight a lot of

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.020 
entire registry and highlight a lot of
things<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.840> thinks<00:01:13.049> are<00:01:13.290> pretty<00:01:14.030> hinky

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
things that it thinks are pretty hinky

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.100 
things that it thinks are pretty hinky
so<00:01:16.640> if<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.759> take<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.939> look<00:01:18.060> at<00:01:18.180> hijack<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:18.840> it

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
so if you take a look at hijack this it

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.950 
so if you take a look at hijack this it
will<00:01:19.729> kind<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.850> list<00:01:21.090> out<00:01:21.240> everything<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.750> it

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
will kind of list out everything that it

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.890 
will kind of list out everything that it
that's<00:01:22.380> on<00:01:22.680> there<00:01:23.420> that's<00:01:24.420> in<00:01:24.570> your<00:01:24.689> computer

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
that's on there that's in your computer

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.620 
that's on there that's in your computer
in<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.200> registry<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.820> Flags<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.450> and

in the registry and that Flags it and

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.330 
in the registry and that Flags it and
then<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.900> can<00:01:28.080> go<00:01:28.200> through<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.860> then<00:01:29.070> tell

then you can go through it and then tell

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.460 
then you can go through it and then tell
it<00:01:29.490> okay<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.509> right<00:01:30.750> this<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.079> wrong<00:01:31.439> this
