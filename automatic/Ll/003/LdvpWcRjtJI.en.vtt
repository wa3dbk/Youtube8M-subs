00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
 Y 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.380
 I'm going to talk to you today about the 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.180
 good habits in the morning that both 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.620
 I promote that sometimes I post them double 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.270
 triple and so on so that people 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.460
 new ones can start and we look at each other 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.220
 all at least have a super morning 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.509
 light, because well, we come from 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.130
 all night of a process of 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:27.290
 natural detoxification that the body 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.970
 He already has a break in 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.800
 the digestion that really is the one 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.720
 more demand energy obviously we are 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.450
 resting we are asleep and the body 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.920
 is taking everything that does not want all 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.390
 the toxins we're all eliminating 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.770
 this is why we get up badly 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.270
 breath where we send color and no more 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.040
 concentrated throughout this process that 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.780
 is carrying the body then with the 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.940
 good habits of the morning number 1 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.830
 we are going to promote that this process of 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.890
 elimination and detoxification that 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:54.740
 we bring in the night we will support it 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.240
 as with a glass of fresh water 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.560
 raised remember that I always give them 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.540
 I say it 's the best thing so this does not 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.640
 fail is to take it one night before to a 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.860
 side of the bed and after giving thanks 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.649
 it's the first thing you can take and go 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.899
 to see how they will see differences 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:10.369
 incredible in just having a glass 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:11.899
 of water in the morning after there 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.940
 comes step 2 which is a cup of 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:14.450
 hot water can be with half a lemon 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.340
 squeeze 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.630
 or just like that alone, it's made to me 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.909
 simpler is now how do you want lemon 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.840
 comes later with the juices then I 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.700
 I take the hot water to 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.079
 temperature of a tea deum coffee not 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.369
 matter may be the kid 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.990
 attracted are those who are fixing 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.670
 or in what men so restoring 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.530
 I do not know is very simple really is a 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.170
 cup of hot water and it will help them 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.060
 very much to continue favoring the 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.159
 detoxification that we bring about everything 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.119
 the elimination then to many 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.380
 people who have problems of 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.610
 constipation will help them a lot 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.500
 to the people who are holding 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.229
 Liquids when showing our period 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.450
 etcetera this remedy is great and 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.490
 comes step 3 which are the shots to me 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.959
 I love shots because if yes 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.280
 before I was super addicted to caffeine the 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:55.399
 truth is that they have helped me a lot 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.020
 so that it has energy gives me an energy 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.610
 stable apart is inflammatory mind 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.929
 daily so I do not hurt anything though 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.549
 I have done a lot of exercise and so on 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:03.829
 an anti-inflammatory that is super 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.539
 effective super powerful natural ready the 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.090
 body recognizes it and loves it then 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:11.840
 I'm fascinated by the shots the truth can 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.880
 get into my blog www mx points and in the 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.349
 part of the search engine put shots bar 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.989
 and there come all the data that I uploaded 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.180
 with grape with pineapple or as the judge of 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.340
 apple with pear and so on 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.599
 They can choose the best want to 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.489
 made the pineapple is the one that knows less 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.150
 because he explains ginger a lot but 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.349
 they are all delicious, they all have their 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.150
 reason for being and everyone has a 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.010
 very very rich combination then they can 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.319
 start with this in the morning and then 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.659
 It comes well then I adore tenth game 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.980
 green the green game is the most 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.329
 truth is that it is a super tool 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.670
 to consume the vegetables that do not 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.709
 we consume normally to consume the 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.900
 amount of spinach green leaves 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.939
 adverse and agree greens and chard the 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.879
 they want but the green leaves are 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:54.489
 they are the most alkalizing that we can 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:57.709
 find remember that alkalinity 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.780
 comes derived from the minerals we 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.840
 we need to remineralize the days 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.220
 because with so much now from what 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.230
 we put on the skin until what 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.019
 we breathe what we take even in 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.480
 water very very very drinkable and others for the 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.730
 truth is that all this causes waste 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.139
 acids in the body this puts us in 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.519
 a state of acidosis there all begin 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:18.799
 the diseases and what we want is 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.950
 alkalize us and this is through a 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.459
 criminalization 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.090
 worth the redundancy of minerals 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.650
 alkalizing as it has been the 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.959
 calcium etc but good the leaves 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.940
 greens are basic for this is the most 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.430
 that we can include green leaves in 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.720
 our played better will be remember 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.670
 that if you want to lose fat do not put 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.440
 a fruit if you do not care is a lot 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.390
 exercise and so on a fruit is fine 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.489
 more than one fruit I do not recommend it to 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.930
 less than good that they are already athletes of 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.519
 high performance et cetera would already be in 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.530
 special cases but good in the common 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.840
 the truth is that a fruit or none 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.660
 fruit is ideal then the green juice in 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.150
 the morning is the maximum and then comes the 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.799
 step 5 in which you can already 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.989
 opt for a breakfast that normally 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.250
 have or can opt for the is very 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.380
 which is the one that I recommend most because 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.500
 because if we continue all morning with 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.090
 fresh natural vegetable foods 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.980
 fruits grains seeds cereals all 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.269
 naturalito everything the body 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.130
 It recognizes all that the body will 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.099
 thanks and apart from not feeling super 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.940
 good energy you see good habits 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:21.220
 are really reflected is something very very 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.780
 curious because even if one wanted to see 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.669
 very healthy that one would like to go down 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.240
 weight nothing more for being very very very 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.639
 skinny skinny 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.470
 that it does not make any sense to be very 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.139
 the cas skinny and no one knows salute the 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.060
 health radiates health health is seen 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.349
 it feels then what I can 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.789
 recommend is to start with these 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:39.590
 morning habits are going to start to see 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:40.940
 abysmal changes do not have to do the 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.650
 program they have to be intoxicating but 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.849
 they have to put on a strict diet not 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.440
 have to do any of this start 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:49.520
 with the morning payments rever true 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:51.139
 they will see a super difference in all 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.910
 the processes of the day are going to eliminate 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.259
 very many chronic diseases very 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.120
 simple as gastritis has been 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:57.710
 colitis and all this will start to see 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.930
 a lot of improvement simply by 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.690
 start with these simple steps like this 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.009
 that if they like it and it works for them 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.690
 please share it every time we are 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:07.280
 more people having a morning 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.520
 ligerita ligerita because we have more 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.800
 energy and already in the afternoon that's why we can 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.870
 eat what we want then please 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.400
 start with this is very simple what 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.979
 What I propose is quite enough 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.539
 quite achievable so good ones 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:22.960
 habits in the morning because nobody is 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:22.960
 deny
