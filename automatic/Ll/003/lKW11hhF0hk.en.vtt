00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.399
 girls hello everyone thank you 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.500
 looked into my channel today in this 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:10.589
 video i want to try to make and 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.370
 a jacket with the help of such a spiral 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:16.740
 A-shaped curlers that I get in 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.960
 the result is light waves or voluminous curls 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.370
 you can see at the end of the video therefore 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.530
 stay with me 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.080
 Some girls wrote to me that 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:28.170
 they have available such here some homes 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.820
 they rarely use their price because 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.520
 they really pull the hair really 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.620
 There is such a problem of these curlers on if 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.519
 you know a couple of nuances how to 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:42.420
 wind up 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:44.909
 then we will not have this problem 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.329
 set of words such a plastic thing 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:51.149
 with hook with which we 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:55.729
 we drag a strand inside the first nuance 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.729
 the hook must necessarily look up 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:14.420
 The second thing I always do is a little 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:17.090
 twisting the strand at the base and the third 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:22.700
 nuance when we push a little strand 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:26.119
 inward we fix it with our fingers 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.670
 position and slightly open 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.990
 hole when we start pulling 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.990
 strand inside 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:43.840
 twist the strand at the base of the hook 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:46.890
 top fix and open at the moment 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.890
 pull strands 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:14.440
 four hours later let's see what 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:17.260
 my hair turned out very hard 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.480
 lends itself to various tabs and especially 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.540
 winding up so this way i 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.500
 I can put a solid top five with a plus 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.910
 curls turned out elastic and voluminous 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.209
 Of course this method takes a lot 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.610
 time but if you want to take care of your 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.820
 hair from different shawl think you 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:42.610
 Well, now you can use 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:44.410
 this hairstyle for photo shoots or for 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.770
 some special holidays 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:52.090
 and you can just decorate such curls 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:55.920
 beautiful hair clips scallops headbands 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.920
 and other hair accessories 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.070
 thank you so much for watching me 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.620

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.450

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.310
 up i say goodbye to you
