00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
extra food you're talking about like the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.450 
extra food you're talking about like the
elevation<00:00:45.750> elevation<00:00:46.309> masks

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
elevation elevation masks

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.340 
elevation elevation masks
I<00:00:47.489> think<00:00:47.879> elevation<00:00:48.329> mask<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.719> cool<00:00:49.020> if<00:00:49.200> you're

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
I think elevation mask is cool if you're

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.709 
I think elevation mask is cool if you're
running<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.190> it's<00:00:50.309> that's<00:00:50.640> you're<00:00:51.360> supposed

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
running and it's that's you're supposed

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.600 
running and it's that's you're supposed
to<00:00:51.809> be<00:00:51.960> getting<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.289> for<00:00:52.410> cardio<00:00:52.770> but<00:00:52.949> tree

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
to be getting it for cardio but tree

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.979 
to be getting it for cardio but tree
doing<00:00:53.789> curls<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.420> have<00:00:54.570> an<00:00:54.660> elevation

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
doing curls and you have an elevation

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.209 
doing curls and you have an elevation
that's<00:00:55.760> yeah<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:57.390> think<00:00:58.050> that's<00:00:58.620> all<00:00:58.770> odd

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
that's yeah I think that's all odd

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.920 
that's yeah I think that's all odd
workouts<00:00:59.789> with<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.030> elevation<00:01:00.420> massive

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
workouts with the elevation massive

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.450 
workouts with the elevation massive
force<00:01:01.170> I'm<00:01:01.410> not<00:01:01.590> sure<00:01:01.770> if<00:01:01.859> they're<00:01:02.039> related<00:01:02.430> to

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
force I'm not sure if they're related to

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.119 
force I'm not sure if they're related to
Bane<00:01:02.760> from<00:01:03.030> Batman<00:01:03.350> but<00:01:04.350> they<00:01:04.500> could<00:01:04.680> be<00:01:04.710> so

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
Bane from Batman but they could be so

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.800 
Bane from Batman but they could be so
they<00:01:05.400> might<00:01:05.549> be<00:01:05.700> getting<00:01:05.939> like<00:01:06.090> juice<00:01:06.299> in<00:01:06.600> that

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
they might be getting like juice in that

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.960 
they might be getting like juice in that
match<00:01:07.049> though<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.500> know<00:01:07.650> that's<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.580> possible

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
match though I know that's a possible

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.390 
match though I know that's a possible
theory<00:01:09.439> I'm<00:01:10.439> just<00:01:10.650> saying<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:10.920> think<00:01:11.130> it's

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
theory I'm just saying I think it's

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.039 
theory I'm just saying I think it's
ridiculous<00:01:11.820> if<00:01:11.970> you're<00:01:12.119> doing<00:01:12.299> cardio<00:01:12.570> stuff

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
ridiculous if you're doing cardio stuff

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.660 
ridiculous if you're doing cardio stuff
that's<00:01:13.409> alright<00:01:14.130> that's<00:01:14.189> awesome<00:01:14.580> you're

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
that's alright that's awesome you're

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.219 
that's alright that's awesome you're
trying<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.060> get<00:01:15.150> your<00:01:15.299> cardiovascular<00:01:15.900> once

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
trying to get your cardiovascular once

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.260 
trying to get your cardiovascular once
but<00:01:16.950> you're<00:01:17.070> doing<00:01:17.280> curls<00:01:17.580> or<00:01:17.970> if<00:01:18.060> you're

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
but you're doing curls or if you're

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.450 
but you're doing curls or if you're
doing<00:01:18.630> friggin<00:01:19.049> cable<00:01:19.439> pull<00:01:19.590> downs<00:01:19.799> with<00:01:20.430> a

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
doing friggin cable pull downs with a

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.980 
doing friggin cable pull downs with a
mascot<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.119> it's<00:01:21.210> kind<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.689> feeding

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
mascot and it's kind of the feeding

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.060 
mascot and it's kind of the feeding
purpose<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.380> that's<00:01:22.470> what<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.740> think<00:01:22.979> is

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
purpose and that's what I think is

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.580 
purpose and that's what I think is
unjust<00:01:23.490> unnecessary<00:01:24.450> for<00:01:25.049> me<00:01:25.170> see<00:01:25.530> I

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
unjust unnecessary for me see I

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.200 
unjust unnecessary for me see I
understand<00:01:26.070> if<00:01:26.189> they're<00:01:26.340> like<00:01:26.490> maybe<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.850> fire

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
understand if they're like maybe a fire

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.929 
understand if they're like maybe a fire
because<00:01:27.689> it's<00:01:27.900> endurance<00:01:28.470> obviously<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.820> it

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
because it's endurance obviously so it

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.359 
because it's endurance obviously so it
makes<00:01:30.119> sense<00:01:30.360> but<00:01:30.479> like<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.619> know<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.979> lot<00:01:32.070> of

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
makes sense but like I know a lot of

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.950 
makes sense but like I know a lot of
people<00:01:32.549> are<00:01:32.610> buying<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.970> because<00:01:33.030> everybody

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
people are buying it because everybody

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.210 
people are buying it because everybody
else<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.320> using<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:34.799> it's<00:01:34.920> more<00:01:35.040> like<00:01:35.189> a

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
else is using it so it's more like a

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.609 
else is using it so it's more like a
trend<00:01:35.610> than<00:01:36.240> anything<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.810> know<00:01:36.840> like<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.380> look

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
trend than anything you know like I look

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.800 
trend than anything you know like I look
cool<00:01:37.829> with<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.189> mass<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.759> like<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.090> don't<00:01:39.540> use

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
cool with this mass and like I don't use

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.069 
cool with this mass and like I don't use
it

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
it

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.260 
it
none<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.590> us<00:01:40.740> use<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.310> doesn't<00:01:41.490> really

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
none of us use it and it doesn't really

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.910 
none of us use it and it doesn't really
give<00:01:42.479> us<00:01:42.540> an<00:01:42.720> edge<00:01:42.869> maybe<00:01:43.110> about<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.560> top

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
give us an edge maybe about the top

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.830 
give us an edge maybe about the top
endurance<00:01:44.759> athletes<00:01:45.240> though<00:01:45.390> I've<00:01:45.600> never

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
endurance athletes though I've never

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.030 
endurance athletes though I've never
even<00:01:45.960> seen<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.590> don't<00:01:46.740> think<00:01:46.860> I've<00:01:46.950> ever

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
even seen that I don't think I've ever

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.609

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
treadmill which actually makes sense

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.620

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
the math doesn't really make sense yeah

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.770 
the math doesn't really make sense yeah
I<00:02:08.320> don't<00:02:08.860> think<00:02:08.950> it's<00:02:09.160> necessary<00:02:09.910> I<00:02:10.300> feel<00:02:10.660> like

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780
