00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:07.689
 hello in the manual activities of 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:10.660
 drawing let's see how to draw a 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:12.870
 clerk in 3d or in perspective 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.809
 in a few minutes 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.900
 here you need a sheet of 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:23.070
 paper drawing a pencil of paper or a 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:27.509
 Criterium of the creator and blue colors 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:32.040
 clear dark blue and purple begin 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:35.280
 with the purple creature to draw the 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.940
 outlines and shadows on the right side 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.750
 glaciers are starting to draw a 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:47.210
 first peak then a second a little bit more 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.210
 top with its shaded areas 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:11.770
 and finally I propose you to draw a 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:14.710
 fourth peak so now at a 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.830
 darker blue chalk to give 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:21.490
 relief to the shaded area with a 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.560
 lighter color than we are going 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:29.380
 also use this blue color 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:33.850
 clear for peak ridges now 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:39.039
 if not the sky with features the 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:41.920
 bottom then light blue which gives with 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:45.280
 the white spaces of the impressions of 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.039
 clouds you only have to 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.319
 mix the colors by the technique 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:53.860
 skating we saw with the 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:56.860
 finger on the colors already the most 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.970
 dark and be careful to keep 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.289
 white areas 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:04.750
 first of all the sky 8 the shaded areas 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.420
 by mixing well the dark blue and the 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.530
 purple with little outdated as I 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.530
 say on the white 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.410
 I 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.850
 let's finish with our drawing at 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:08.920
 pencil of paper on the contours but 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.920
 also the shadows 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.720
 a last touch for good 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:58.510
 mix the colors and that's your 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.510
 drawing of a glacier is complete 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.730
 goodbye and see you soon
