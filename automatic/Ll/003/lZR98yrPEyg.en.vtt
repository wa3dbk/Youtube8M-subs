00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 friends, hello to you, fan made 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.820
 and today we will see this 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.980
 the game 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:15.269
 shorter by the name surin islands 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.850
 This is an early version of the game on android. 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.439
 she and she and fail and u talk 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.670
 everything else but I decided to show you 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:27.449
 so that you do not dirty the type developer 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.869
 oh you go go why are you only a little 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.719
 do this and because this is paradise 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.290
 early version then there is a game still in 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.860
 the development would be more likely from the market 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:46.050
 free shadows we'll look at 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:49.140
 The first chips of the game and I hope in this game 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:53.340
 will develop so on here you can 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:57.000
 fight walk their islands proper 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:02.010
 speaking of the structure beautiful let you 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.799
 say so water is very beautiful guys you 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:10.140
 look now even get doubles for 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:14.100
 that you looked very nice guys 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:18.030
 I like that kind of schedule but that's how 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.970
 all games on android such know who 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.630
 which did unity with them 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.930
 for some reason you constantly cell like how 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:33.299
 here he is already so behind ass such a bobok 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:35.700
 what is it that I don't know ok ok 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.930
 the island is small because the developers 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.570
 Yet not all have done so much, I do 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.960
 we can't do just walk 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:50.180
 explore the island and you probably you 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:54.180
 probably noticed that we have a house there we 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:57.899
 we collapsed in rows was near the house you can 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:04.290
 remove tapu to fix it 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:05.390
 Well, take a little four-something and I do not presume to all 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.289
 guys 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:12.200
 the total means let us go in with you 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:20.600
 little house here by the way is kind of like a boat i am so 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:26.480
 I understand the current already God until priests will 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:29.480
 turn it kapets well come on so well 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:36.950
 this is this kind of we will be such a share 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:40.060
 do the future so come on your yin-yang 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.970
 Well , of course I like the guys 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.880
 very similar to the query of course you can see 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.970
 that the leaves here are so everything is so clumsily 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:55.269
 done but not this buffer is just ok 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.269
 or vessel say what we have inside 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:03.050
 some kind of strange green wave okay a 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:06.530
 as you can see here we have our type of it 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:10.640
 come on faster and type a knife this worker 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:17.329
 a chair or something like this in note it 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:23.209
 to knife unfortunately you can't take it 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:25.400
 Well all bad of course still there may 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.700
 many sky us from playing for being there 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:32.440
 few things 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:39.049
 that just stupidly walk you and swing 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:41.209
 that time i am i i think the developer is not 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:45.110
 leave this case and will develop 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:48.709
 the game and maybe it will be the same as 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:54.430

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:54.430
