00:00:00.334 --> 00:00:03.636
So, I want to experiment
with carving an old fashioned

00:00:03.637 --> 00:00:07.440
almost historic sort of shape
with my copy carver.

00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:10.776
And the shape I chose is

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:14.714
a rotary phone. You don't see
many of those around anymore.

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:17.583
Carving away lots of material with
the router is no fun at all so

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:21.098
I'm going to try to minimize
that just by getting

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.190
the outline and cutting
it with a band saw.

00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:27.693
So, I rough note a lot of the phone blank.
And so here's my phone.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.695
I mounted both of those sideways

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:33.065
to make it easier to get
at these sides here.

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:36.202
And, this time I'm
using a round follower

00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:44.203
and a ball-nose router bit.

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:12.138
So, this has worked out pretty
well for carving the sides

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:15.575
and the top For the
front and for the back

00:01:15.576 --> 00:01:19.512
I just don't have enough reach because
I keep hitting this part here.

00:01:19.513 --> 00:01:21.948
So, when I bring down the router

00:01:21.949 --> 00:01:24.684
It'll only come down this far.

00:01:24.685 --> 00:01:28.821
So, what we're gonna try to do is
change the orientation of these.

00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:31.257
And then finish carving.

00:01:31.258 --> 00:01:34.126
So, I got my two
phones reoriented.

00:01:34.127 --> 00:01:37.930
And let's just check
the orientation.

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:42.635
Everything at the alignment
is exactly where it was.

00:01:42.636 --> 00:01:50.636
Good.

00:01:50.711 --> 00:01:53.713
Yeah, that's good.

00:01:53.714 --> 00:02:01.714
So, now I can carve
the front and back.

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.204
I can only carve so much detail
with one of these round bits.

00:02:18.205 --> 00:02:21.908
So, I switched to a
1/4 inch straight bit

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:25.545
And on here, I put a 1/4 inch bolt
and I wrapped some tape around it

00:02:25.546 --> 00:02:28.114
to make this a bit
thicker than 1/4 inch.

00:02:28.115 --> 00:02:32.251
That will leave a little bit more
space around the dial pieces.

00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:35.121
So that I don't carve these too
thin because previously I had some

00:02:35.122 --> 00:02:43.122
pieces kind of chip out on me.

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.839
So far so good. It just needs
a little bit of smoothing.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.041
And the receiver.

00:02:55.042 --> 00:02:58.811
So, here's ready to cut
the phone receiver.

00:02:58.812 --> 00:03:00.680
I've got it clamped here.

00:03:00.681 --> 00:03:03.382
I can only do one side. I'll have
to flip this to do the other side.

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:06.686
Here is the blank. I've tried to rough
out the shape as much as possible

00:03:06.687 --> 00:03:10.289
with the band saw. So I don't
have to carve away as much.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.859
And because the router makes so much dust.
I hooked up

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.863
the hose from my dust collector
to just suck it up here.

00:03:16.864 --> 00:03:22.034
I just check with the router. It
should always touch the blank

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:30.035
before the follower
touches the phone.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.467
Well ok, top half is carved. Now I
just have to flip both of these over.

00:03:54.468 --> 00:04:02.468
Get the alignment right.
And carve the other half.

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:32.038
And now I just have to screw that
down, very carefully. Without moving.

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:35.174
So, just checking
the alignment here.

00:04:35.175 --> 00:04:38.678
That we've got the bit touching

00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:43.182
just as it touches the phone on the
parts that we've already carved.

00:04:43.183 --> 00:04:51.183
That alignment is close enough.

00:04:55.562 --> 00:04:58.497
So, I couldn't carve the
back of the handle because

00:04:58.498 --> 00:05:01.000
my original is
mounted like this.

00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:09.001
So, I'll finish that
on the band saw.

00:05:10.944 --> 00:05:13.679
Well, so that's why... {Telephone Ringing}

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.082
Hello? Hello?

00:05:16.083 --> 00:05:18.017
Hello?

00:05:18.018 --> 00:05:20.653
Guess it still needs some work.

00:05:20.654 --> 00:05:23.222
Well, aside from the dropped calls.
I also didn't take the time

00:05:23.223 --> 00:05:25.925
to really smooth
out the surfaces.

00:05:25.926 --> 00:05:28.928
So, that's a tough one for a
plastic object, like that

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:31.731
because you really expect
it to be nice and smooth.

00:05:31.732 --> 00:05:34.233
It's different for
natural objects.

00:05:34.234 --> 00:05:37.537
But still, it's a pretty
neat and classic shape.

00:05:37.538 --> 00:05:41.141
Much harder to carve
than an iPhone would be.
