window you know suction cup in order to

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.939 
window you know suction cup in order to

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
make it stick and you could stick

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:18.979 
make it stick and you could stick
Spidey<00:04:17.519> on<00:04:17.789> there<00:04:17.970> you<00:04:18.060> could<00:04:18.209> put<00:04:18.389> his<00:04:18.570> hands

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
Spidey on there you could put his hands

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.629 
Spidey on there you could put his hands
in<00:04:19.109> between<00:04:19.199> there<00:04:19.620> and<00:04:19.650> he'll<00:04:19.979> stick<00:04:20.310> on<00:04:20.489> to

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
in between there and he'll stick on to

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.689 
in between there and he'll stick on to
it<00:04:20.789> and<00:04:21.289> frankly<00:04:22.289> it<00:04:22.650> could<00:04:23.190> be<00:04:23.280> used<00:04:23.520> either

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
it and frankly it could be used either

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.240 
it and frankly it could be used either
for<00:04:24.060> show<00:04:24.240> or<00:04:24.539> for<00:04:25.259> just<00:04:25.440> actually<00:04:26.039> for<00:04:26.190> this

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
for show or for just actually for this

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.610 
for show or for just actually for this
play<00:04:26.490> purses<00:04:26.940> is<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.180> same<00:04:27.360> thing<00:04:27.599> but

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.589 

actually<00:04:31.620> I<00:04:31.650> can<00:04:31.949> actually<00:04:32.280> find<00:04:32.639> any<00:04:32.940> other

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:33.599 
actually I can actually find any other

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:35.570 
actually I can actually find any other
function<00:04:34.229> for<00:04:34.470> it<00:04:34.560> so<00:04:34.740> I<00:04:34.770> guess<00:04:35.039> it's<00:04:35.220> just<00:04:35.400> for

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
function for it so I guess it's just for

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.760 
function for it so I guess it's just for
show

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770
