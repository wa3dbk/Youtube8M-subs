00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
but I know on a desktop PC you can just

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.710 
but I know on a desktop PC you can just
use<00:03:16.750> numpad<00:03:17.320> but<00:03:17.920> fortunately<00:03:18.550> laptops<00:03:19.450> don't

those are the giant ones that cost like
$2,000<00:03:24.940> so<00:03:25.110> also<00:03:26.459> about<00:03:27.459> Blokland<00:03:28.050> that<00:03:30.030> it's

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
$2,000 so also about Blokland that it's

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.290 
$2,000 so also about Blokland that it's
well<00:03:32.560> it<00:03:32.980> doesn't<00:03:33.310> have<00:03:33.370> that<00:03:33.519> go<00:03:33.700> to<00:03:33.760> physics

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
well it doesn't have that go to physics
