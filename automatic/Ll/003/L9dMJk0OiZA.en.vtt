00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.899
The Yukon Gaiter is a 3-layer hard shell gaiter

00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:15.779
using

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.720
Toray

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.320
Dermizax NX laminate

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.620
that's going to give us high breathability 
and high stretch.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.020
We've designed the Yukon Gaiter to be done with no seams

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.560
and that's going to allow us to have a 
longer lasting more durable design

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.090
that's quiet and highly breathable.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.020
You'll see this gaiter has a velcro closure on the front

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.940
riveted lace hook and a snap closure
to hold it secure,

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.940
a buckle closure

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.580
and highly durable PU coated webbing

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.740
that goes underneath your boot

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.280
and a webbing cinch that's going to go
around your upper calf.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.920
This design has the reinforcement
bonded to the inside of this gaiter

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.840
so you're going to find one fabric panel

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.960
that runs up the entire length of this gaiter

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.680
and we did that to eliminate week points

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.140
within the design of other gaiters that we've tested

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.340
and used in the past

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.060
and horizontal seems

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.380
where they mesh up with the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.280
reinforcement on the lower part of gaiters

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.440
typically fails over extended use

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.360
and so we wanted to design a gaiter with no seams

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.620
to maximize the durability

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.060
and we did that by using a single panel
of fabric through the entire gaiter

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.940
and the bottom third of the gaiter

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.740
is a bonded reinforcement

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.150
that's done on the inside of this design of
the gaiter

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.820
this allows us to be incredibly durable

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.260
no seams

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.200
and we're utilizing the Yukon fabric in this gaiter

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.980
which has the

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.600
Toray Dermizax NX laminate in it which allows for

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.500
40,000 MPV rating so it's going to breath like crazy

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.700
and also probably even more important
for this gaiter is the 200% stretch

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.860
so we're going to have lots of stretch,

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.400
no seams,

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.460
a bonded reinforced bottom of this gaiter 
that's going to give us a lot of durability

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.760
and longevity of this gaiter and 
make it really comfortable to wear.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.680
You combine all of the components
and features of this gaiter and

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.580
really have created a really 
high performance mountain product.
