00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.420 
the mop the guy in the middle not much
really<00:01:58.079> has<00:01:58.290> change<00:01:58.649> when<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.009> comes<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.340> the

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
really has change when it comes to the

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.580 
really has change when it comes to the
board<00:01:59.640> it's<00:01:59.909> all<00:02:00.000> color<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.420> same<00:02:00.659> which<00:02:01.560> is

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
board it's all color the same which is

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.399 
board it's all color the same which is
fine<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:02.130> enjoy<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.479> similarities<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.290> the

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
fine I enjoy the similarities to the

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.319 
fine I enjoy the similarities to the
first<00:02:04.590> game<00:02:04.829> so<00:02:05.219> just<00:02:05.729> keep<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:05.969> all<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.090> same

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
first game so just keep it all the same

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.930 
first game so just keep it all the same
and<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:06.630> works<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.200> best<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.560> think<00:02:07.940> you've

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
and that works the best I think you've

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.160 
and that works the best I think you've
got<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.239> go<00:02:09.420> all<00:02:10.259> the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.360 

places<00:02:14.170> have<00:02:14.350> a<00:02:14.380> real-life<00:02:14.770> counterpart

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
places have a real-life counterpart

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.620 
places have a real-life counterpart
which<00:02:15.520> I'm<00:02:15.670> actually<00:02:15.820> familiar<00:02:16.090> with<00:02:16.510> the

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
which I'm actually familiar with the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.710 
which I'm actually familiar with the
time<00:02:16.840> it's<00:02:17.020> all<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.320> American<00:02:17.920> ones<00:02:18.190> so<00:02:19.120> I<00:02:19.150> can

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
time it's all the American ones so I can

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.620 
time it's all the American ones so I can
relate<00:02:20.440> to<00:02:20.620> those<00:02:20.860> because<00:02:21.850> I'm<00:02:22.150> an<00:02:22.270> American

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
relate to those because I'm an American

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.930 
relate to those because I'm an American
so<00:02:22.870> I<00:02:22.960> know<00:02:23.020> where<00:02:23.290> these<00:02:23.410> are<00:02:23.650> places<00:02:23.950> are<00:02:24.280> for

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
so I know where these are places are for

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.690 
so I know where these are places are for
the<00:02:25.030> most<00:02:25.210> part<00:02:25.380> so<00:02:26.380> I<00:02:26.650> really<00:02:27.010> enjoyed<00:02:27.400> the

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
the most part so I really enjoyed the

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.210 
the most part so I really enjoyed the
similarities<00:02:28.300> between<00:02:28.480> these<00:02:28.840> ones<00:02:29.220> unlike

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
similarities between these ones unlike

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.920 
similarities between these ones unlike
the<00:02:30.370> last<00:02:30.550> one<00:02:30.850> when<00:02:31.000> I<00:02:31.030> had<00:02:31.270> all<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.570> world

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
all right so this is the electronic

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.999 
all right so this is the electronic
banking<00:05:20.849> unit<00:05:21.180> you've<00:05:21.900> got<00:05:22.080> the<00:05:22.259> minus<00:05:22.800> side

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:23.009 
banking unit you've got the minus side

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:25.730 
banking unit you've got the minus side
and<00:05:23.310> the<00:05:23.520> plus<00:05:23.759> side<00:05:24.030> the<00:05:24.750> cards<00:05:25.169> go<00:05:25.349> in<00:05:25.560> these

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
and the plus side the cards go in these

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.219 
and the plus side the cards go in these
sides<00:05:26.039> this<00:05:26.430> time<00:05:26.759> which<00:05:27.569> is<00:05:27.599> actually<00:05:28.020> a<00:05:28.050> lot

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
sides this time which is actually a lot

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:30.110 
sides this time which is actually a lot
better<00:05:28.440> because<00:05:28.650> there's<00:05:28.860> no<00:05:29.069> mistaking<00:05:29.880> the

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
better because there's no mistaking the

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.570 
better because there's no mistaking the
pegs<00:05:30.469> so<00:05:31.469> you<00:05:31.560> put<00:05:31.710> it<00:05:31.800> in<00:05:31.889> the<00:05:31.949> side<00:05:32.159> and

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
pegs so you put it in the side and

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.800 
pegs so you put it in the side and
there's<00:05:32.849> no<00:05:33.000> way<00:05:33.150> of<00:05:33.240> putting<00:05:33.389> it<00:05:33.599> in<00:05:33.690> there

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
there's no way of putting it in there

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.689 
there's no way of putting it in there
crooked<00:05:34.169> I<00:05:34.380> mean<00:05:34.710> there's<00:05:34.860> absolutely<00:05:35.039> no<00:05:35.490> way

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699 
crooked I mean there's absolutely no way

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:38.809 
crooked I mean there's absolutely no way
that<00:05:35.940> one<00:05:36.750> has<00:05:36.840> 25<00:05:37.319> million<00:05:37.620> it<00:05:38.280> always<00:05:38.490> keeps

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:38.819 
that one has 25 million it always keeps

after two weeks three weeks it's still

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.469 
after two weeks three weeks it's still
going<00:05:43.800> to<00:05:43.830> be<00:05:43.919> have<00:05:44.310> your<00:05:44.789> total<00:05:45.060> up<00:05:45.270> there

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
going to be have your total up there

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:47.390 
going to be have your total up there
even<00:05:45.630> after<00:05:45.840> you<00:05:46.020> finish<00:05:46.319> the<00:05:46.469> game<00:05:46.500> the<00:05:47.370> only
