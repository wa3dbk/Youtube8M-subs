00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.619 
out it's a pretty nice and some little
things<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.200> I'm<00:00:43.290> seeing<00:00:43.530> right<00:00:43.680> here<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:44.190> the

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
things that I'm seeing right here on the

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.819 
things that I'm seeing right here on the
onset<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.660> like<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.050> loading<00:00:46.350> screen<00:00:46.379> and

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829

trying<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.160> create<00:00:50.760> some<00:00:51.059> kind<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.329> awareness

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750

instead has more damage more accuracy um
faster<00:02:22.570> reload<00:02:22.930> speed<00:02:23.290> so<00:02:23.650> yeah<00:02:24.100> i<00:02:24.190> think<00:02:24.280> i'm

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
faster reload speed so yeah i think i'm

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.210 
faster reload speed so yeah i think i'm
going<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.640> set<00:02:24.820> up<00:02:24.940> fish<00:02:25.350> on<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:27.010> stock<00:02:27.400> sea
