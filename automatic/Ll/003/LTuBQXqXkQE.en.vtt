 we see since yesterday yesterday it 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.960
 canceled the flight that was scheduled for 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.630

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.790

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.820
 so until 8 o'clock at 8 a.m. 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.070
 the night we were informed that was 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.980
 flight and today we are here from the one of 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.090
 the afternoon and until this time is six o'clock 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.340
 and a quarter of the afternoon and we're 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.689
 desperate to return to venezuela not 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.890
 no longer do we have no we do not have money 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.689
 we want to travel with another line there is no 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.260
 fit and these magnificent people have 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.090
 personado up there to tell us that 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.340
 no answer type an answer 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.510
 concrete that really satisfies us with 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.550
 we simply what we want is 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.250
 back to our country we already have two 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.040
 trying it and the airline law 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.430
 about 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.670
 or rather it's about if it does not move away you do not 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.280
 about your country does not take you to where 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:00.110
 you guys spent the night 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:02.390
 the airline gave us a hotel 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.620
 to spend the night when you notice the 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.720
 canary that supposedly the flight left 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.310
 today at half past four I have here 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.140
 I have the tickets that indicate that the 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.880
 flight leaves at 4 and they told us so much 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.810
 that we had to be here at one 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.000
 they usually ate today in the 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.619
 hotel and the rest here have me in these 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.119
 without dollars without anything like you do for 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.040
 eat with a change control 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.440
 venezuela you do not have an open quota for 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.420
 Do what you want if it is not what it is 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:35.119
 what is of law point here can you 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:37.009
 see September 3 4 and 25 pm are 6 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.450
 in the afternoon we are here in the afternoon 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.580
 there is no response from the plane 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.650
 today we are desperate we need 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.020
 return to the country I am working on 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.340
 also how do you tell your boss that 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.590
 you are trapped in a country that 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.470
 supposedly by the airline they are going to 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.510
 say go lie to a day now 2 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.490
 it is impossible two days that you are 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.590
 trapped abroad to another country 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.470
 not sold by the airline is 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.330
 totally unfair and being curazao so 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.690
 near venezuela there are more people than 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.040
 you yes very many friends how many 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.990
 approximately 30 more people or 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.700
 unless this person just has to go 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.530
 to see all have to stop alone 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.150
 and they are all very upset from above 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.820
 we got off on our own 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.190
 to find another line that has 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.440
 flights to Caracas that have already closed 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.080
 all in unfortunately and we come for 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.620
 here to see what answer we have to do 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:31.640
 here where where you refer above 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:34.280
 up after immigration inside 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.950
 worse because up there 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.560
 a representative of the airline and today 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.180
 we already had to talk from a 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.740
 phone that was put we found out 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.209
 the number to do here we call rose the 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.670
 young no one gives us an answer 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.440
 concrete the deal has been terrible today 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.700
 we are really desperate if 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.380
 we could lower the rest of the 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.420
 passengers would realize there are people with 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.820
 yesterday there were people with children lying on the 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.870
 floor up there thanks to only one 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.819
 child today 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.510
 but this can not be this can not be 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.510
 this is inconceivable
