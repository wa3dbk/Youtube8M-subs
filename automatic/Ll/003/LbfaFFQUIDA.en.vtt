but<00:05:13.139> I<00:05:13.229> will<00:05:13.349> say<00:05:13.530> that<00:05:13.560> there<00:05:13.830> were<00:05:13.919> a<00:05:13.949> couple

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:14.099 
but I will say that there were a couple

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:16.399 
but I will say that there were a couple
notes<00:05:14.669> that<00:05:14.969> felt<00:05:15.180> a<00:05:15.389> little<00:05:15.659> off<00:05:16.080> to<00:05:16.289> me

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:16.409 
notes that felt a little off to me

the<00:05:31.259> book<00:05:31.409> I<00:05:31.530> thought<00:05:31.710> was<00:05:31.889> strongest<00:05:32.370> when<00:05:32.550> we

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
the book I thought was strongest when we

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.580 
the book I thought was strongest when we
were<00:05:32.789> with<00:05:33.030> the<00:05:33.270> characters<00:05:33.780> though<00:05:34.259> it<00:05:34.380> does

were with the characters though it does

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.529 
were with the characters though it does
make<00:05:34.800> some<00:05:35.009> larger<00:05:35.460> statements<00:05:36.029> that<00:05:36.120> I<00:05:36.210> think

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
make some larger statements that I think

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.269

do<00:05:36.810> work<00:05:37.080> but<00:05:37.529> some<00:05:37.800> were<00:05:37.979> at<00:05:38.159> least

00:05:38.269 --> 00:05:38.279 
do work but some were at least

almost<00:05:49.620> had<00:05:50.130> too<00:05:50.819> much<00:05:51.150> perspective<00:05:52.110> and<00:05:52.440> it

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
almost had too much perspective and it

some larger point the novel is trying to

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:01.370 
some larger point the novel is trying to
make<00:05:59.400> it<00:05:59.639> seem<00:05:59.880> like<00:05:59.909> the<00:06:00.630> characters<00:06:01.139> were

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:02.759 
really not the people we've been

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:05.240 
really not the people we've been
following<00:06:03.419> all<00:06:03.599> of<00:06:03.810> this<00:06:03.930> time<00:06:04.259> but<00:06:04.919> I<00:06:05.069> was

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
following all of this time but I was

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.010 
following all of this time but I was
able<00:06:05.520> to<00:06:05.550> look<00:06:05.789> beyond<00:06:06.300> that<00:06:06.419> a<00:06:06.539> little<00:06:06.870> bit

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
able to look beyond that a little bit

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.499 
able to look beyond that a little bit
just<00:06:07.319> to<00:06:07.440> imagine<00:06:07.770> that<00:06:08.279> that's<00:06:08.909> kind<00:06:09.210> of<00:06:09.330> the

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:09.509 
just to imagine that that's kind of the

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:12.409 
just to imagine that that's kind of the
form<00:06:09.840> that<00:06:09.990> Greece<00:06:10.409> can<00:06:10.440> take<00:06:11.250> when<00:06:11.940> it's<00:06:12.180> in

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
form that Greece can take when it's in

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:14.600 
form that Greece can take when it's in
the<00:06:13.050> first<00:06:13.349> stages<00:06:13.919> where<00:06:14.159> you're<00:06:14.310> just

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
the first stages where you're just

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.510 
the first stages where you're just
shocked<00:06:15.330> and<00:06:15.750> not<00:06:16.259> really<00:06:16.620> able<00:06:16.979> to<00:06:17.190> deal<00:06:17.370> with

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 
shocked and not really able to deal with

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.830 
shocked and not really able to deal with
your<00:06:17.639> pain<00:06:17.849> yet<00:06:18.180> perhaps<00:06:18.449> I'm<00:06:18.810> just

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
your pain yet perhaps I'm just

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.480 
your pain yet perhaps I'm just
protective<00:06:19.560> over<00:06:19.680> them<00:06:19.949> because<00:06:20.159> the

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490 
protective over them because the

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:21.769 
protective over them because the

Americans<00:06:22.289> felt<00:06:22.650> very<00:06:22.860> real<00:06:23.219> to<00:06:23.490> me<00:06:23.669> and<00:06:23.940> I<00:06:24.240> was

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
Americans felt very real to me and I was

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.390 
Americans felt very real to me and I was
really<00:06:24.509> invested<00:06:25.169> in<00:06:25.380> their<00:06:25.590> lives<00:06:25.889> and<00:06:26.340> I

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
really invested in their lives and I

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.800 
really invested in their lives and I
think<00:06:26.580> I<00:06:26.669> will<00:06:26.819> continue<00:06:26.940> to<00:06:27.330> think<00:06:27.930> of<00:06:28.110> them

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
think I will continue to think of them

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.360 
think I will continue to think of them
though<00:06:28.930> the<00:06:29.050> kind<00:06:29.260> of<00:06:29.350> characters<00:06:29.800> that<00:06:29.830> you

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370
