00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello youtube I hope you are very 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.750
 well in this video I will answer the 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.160
 ask what else do I receive from you day 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.040
 with day 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.110
 the subject of this video is undoubtedly one of 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.779
 the most controversial in the world of 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.090
 technology and I decided to make a video on 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.860
 specific about this topic because it is 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.529
 impressive the number of users 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.510
 who ask me the next question which 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.240
 It is the best mobile operating system 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.730
 I'm about to buy a phone and 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.650
 I do not know which one to choose sometimes 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.720
 I have already told you that it is 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.330
 impossible to determine which is the best 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.640
 operating system because this does not depend 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.559
 in its entirety from the same fate of each 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.460
 user systems today 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:48.309
 mobile operatives are all excellent 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.989
 mainly three of them android ios 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.520
 and windows phones 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.829
 each of these three systems 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.079
 operatives has its virtues and 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.730
 defects but I assure you that to the great 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.469
 majority of the general public 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.390
 any of these three systems 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.760
 operatives will work to the 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.259
 perfection in your daily life you have to 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.240
 remember that not all people 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.970
 have the same level of 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.830
 technological knowledge the vast majority 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.750
 of users only acquire a 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.920
 phone for the marketing that there is 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.930
 behind him 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.000
 I hope that the comments part of 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.100
 this video does not become a field of 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.170
 war between fanboys but I would love 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.570
 which could leave in the comments 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.420
 what is your favorite operating system and 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.340
 why personally and as a lover 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.979
 of technology makes me impossible 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.659
 choose only one but what they do 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.229
 I can mention are some qualities 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.880
 of each operating system for example to 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.420
 joe is I find the operating system 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.640
 most stable there is fluid and fast and 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.259
 this is largely due to the fact that only 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.500
 there is a phone that has this 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.509
 operating system the iphone talking about 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.580
 android this I love every day more 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.799
 starting with the great variety of 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.229
 phones available and going through 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.630
 unique qualities like the great level of 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.789
 personalization and having one of the 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.179
 largest companies in the world behind 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.950
 from her google and talking about 'windows 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.739
 phone 'considers it an operating system 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.959
 unique and original is also very stable 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.910
 and in general it seems to me that it has 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.120
 very useful applications for the day to 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.100
 day if you are looking for something different this system 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.000
 operative is functional and as already 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.610
 I mentioned before 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.620
 unique so for all users 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.030
 they always ask me for the best 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.800
 OS 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.440
 the answer remains the same 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.870
 all have great virtues and 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.060
 few defects but at the end of the day 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.330
 I recommend putting your money where your 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.640
 That's how it is, even if you hear a little 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.590
 romantic this is the best advice that 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.660
 I can give you, because you do not have any 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.840
 meaning that they end up buying something that 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.760
 not want to 100% ultimately can 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.560
 be a phone charge a game 2 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.750
 seconds faster than another phone 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.120
 but while the product that you 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.739
 you bought, it satisfies you, it does not owe you 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.959
 import the compare it with another 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.450
 device apart from that with the 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.760
 technology nothing lasts a long time being 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.239
 the best so better enjoy what 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.739
 you have at the moment you have it 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.840
 let me know in the comments if you 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.820

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.970

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.770
 often from you and if so, no 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.180
