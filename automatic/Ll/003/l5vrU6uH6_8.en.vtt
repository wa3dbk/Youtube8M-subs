00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.909
 pretty funny and how are you going to see 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:16.920
 we're going to be drunk all the time 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:18.240
 that we want and well then the 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.620
 We screen will not look normal 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.660
 it's going to look cloudy and all that, so 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.040
 Well, it's going to be pretty funny and good 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.690
 then we will be able to be in this state 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.140
 as long as we want until 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:30.150
 we want to commit suicide or change 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.410
 of session or whatever it is worth but good 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.759
 meanwhile we're going to be here 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.600
 drunk all the time you give us the 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.000
 wins because we will be 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.440
 permanent all the time like that then 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.660
 as you are watching it is super funny 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.770
 we are going to walk tripping and everything 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.660
 the truth is that they are laughs 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.150
 tremendous and if you take the car for years 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.370
 you imagine going everywhere and good 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.540
 it's pretty funny and good before 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.610
 Nothing to tell you to leave in the description 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.290
 the link of the previous video that is a 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.120
 draw of a totally gaming team 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.160
 free I advise you to go for 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.020
 to be able to participate and such and such, well, nothing 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.250
 having said that we are going to continue with the 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.140
 trick the first thing we have to do 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.300
 is to go to our apartment our house 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.250
 or the house of any other and we have 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.630
 that go where the whiskey is going to 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.970
 give whiskey to drink gas and then 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.280
 for five or six times until 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.800
 sees everyone see blurry and that is the 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.720
 been this super drunk and then 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.850
 now right after we're going to go and we're going to 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.020
 add the cachina of what is coming 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.820
 being the tube this big by itself 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.920
 someone does not know what it is let's smoke 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.420
 once and we're going to go out 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.580
 when we go out to the street we will see 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.320
 that the effect of that is blurry and everything 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.440
 that is removed but the character is going to 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.870
 keep drunk and ximo is going to continue there 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.550
 basically put on top that overturns 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.750
 almost and well, the truth is quite 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.190

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.930
