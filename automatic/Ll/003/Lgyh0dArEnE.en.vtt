00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:16.860
 now we are in a new video 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:20.860
 episode 3 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:24.490
 has come out on youtube that has come out of 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:28.449
 again we can put gif and good I'll 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.820
 teach how to make photoshop is one of 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.689
 the easiest ways you can 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.030
 do 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:38.860
 and good 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:41.820
 and not just change the color we can do 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.920
 of everything for example my banner 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.590
 secretly I have gold as you can 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.860
 see if it changes color and also has 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.480
 like for example how is summer going to be 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.530
 he had used to believe that I 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.440
 exposed these atoms of fire like the 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.829
 fire the trees 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.579
 the tops of the leaves as well as they are 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.579
 falling to the trees 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.729
 and what we would get the effect 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:14.420
 It depends on the time that we put 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.940
 we to the image is changed and from 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.490
 the effect that has changed us and now 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.399
 it's on fire they use in the jeep it 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.900
 it's about that it's like a video but with 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:27.790
 a shorter decision 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.480
 and how to do it because we have nothing to 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.570
 come here 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.140
 this in photoshop 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.560
 s 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:42.310
 We will have to come here to 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:46.329
 up windows you have the window of 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.790
 up but macro we have up here and 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:51.780
 well we have to give it here 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:59.370
 in the workspace this is the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:02:02.370
 photoshop cs5 or it is also 416 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.370
 animation 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:09.079
 we give here to the movement 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.079
 and it did not come out 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:20.069
 I did not know this 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:23.450
 and well we have here we give here in 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.450
 so that they open in small squares 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:30.090
 well and good we would have to do to 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.209
 that the effect is created we have to create 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.600
 another new layer and that stays in the 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.940
 Red 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.580
 we have already created to the effect we give here 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:44.320
 down to see them play 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:46.210
 and like that work as he exposes the 5 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.040
 seconds 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.050
 we can change it for example 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:55.060
 as a second 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.060
 They are fast and I hope better 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.410
 we are in the video 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:09.360
 it would not look like this the effect is already clear 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.360
 is created now how to save them 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:15.360
 to see a gif and to save any 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.330
 image 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:22.380
 I recommend you save for web 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.380
 the highest possible quality 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:31.980
 photoshop cs3 here several options for 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:36.670
 save it I put 128 without screening 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.319
 like a pixelated affecting me and I 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.370
 would go down here also options 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.370
 repeat once 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.890
 once the gif is done, we save it 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.730
 we can 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.730
 with rose 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:09.239
 and how it would stay would stay like that 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:11.489
 You see also the color and well we have already 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.890
 got the effect I hope there's 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.229
 liked today that he learned how 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.130
 make a kit if you have any questions 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:21.650
 the comments and expected 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:31.090
 and if you have any questions more 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:31.090
 comments also to spend it
