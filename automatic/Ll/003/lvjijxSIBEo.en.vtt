00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
kind of like I don't know just really

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.819

really get a new perspective on life
which<00:00:44.280> obviously<00:00:44.640> helps<00:00:45.059> keep<00:00:45.239> my<00:00:45.390> cortisol

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
which obviously helps keep my cortisol

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.130 
which obviously helps keep my cortisol
down<00:00:46.200> because<00:00:46.710> when<00:00:47.460> I'm<00:00:47.579> back<00:00:47.910> home<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.360> LA<00:00:48.660> I

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
down because when I'm back home in LA I

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.630 
down because when I'm back home in LA I
can<00:00:49.379> sit<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.739> reflect<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.340> think<00:00:50.370> about

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
can sit and reflect and think about

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.590 
can sit and reflect and think about
these<00:00:51.600> types<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.079> places<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.649> was<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:52.980> and

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600
