00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.500
Requirements:

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:22.400
1. Specific items in the box. See the description for details.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:39.700
2a) Any low level Pokemon, preferably a recently caught one
2b) A Quagsire, with item HP Up, and Sleep Talk as the first move.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.500
3. And obviously, Coin Case.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:01:01.100
Step 1: Put the low level Pokemon in your third slot. Put the Quagsire in your 4th slot.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:22.400
Step 2: Is not an arbitrary code execution step, but a step necessary for the example program.
Go to the name rater and change your first Pokemon's nickname to something 10 characters long.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:02:06.400
Step 3: Is not an arbitrary code execution step, but a step necessary for the example program.
Go to the name rater and change your first Pokemon's nickname to something 9 characters long.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:27.200
Step 4: Go to Elm's lab, save the game and reset.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:55.500
Step 5: Exit the lab, take four steps right. Then open your Pokedex and listen to Machoke's cry.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Step 6: Switch to your Key Items Pocket and use Coin Case.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Done! It just executed a program stored in the PC.
That example "Hello World" program displays the first Pokemon's nickname instead of the amount of coins.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.800
