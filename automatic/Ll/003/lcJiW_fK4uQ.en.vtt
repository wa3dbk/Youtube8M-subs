00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hey people in this video is already 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.299
 again a small product review for 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:17.160
 you and it is about an iphone 5 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:20.039
 Carbons child that only cost ten 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.130
 euro on ebay again link goes to it 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.310
 of course in the description 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.900
 this this this model I say here 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.179
 Sometimes it comes in different colors 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.099
 will also anthracite in ten years 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.809
 and so on just look on the 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.600
 I pass you over in the 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.079
 description left to everyone 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.989
 case cool for 10 euros we come 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.110
 just once share to the different 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:48.149
 so we have the front 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.789
 he demands say I have two 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.760
 share and that is again the all-around 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.610
 and the home button 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.320
 As we can see this carbon fiber 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.440
 pattern runs perfectly over the 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.140
 different parts about so these 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.750
 lines completely recognize 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.320
 it's the same with the back 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.260
 The back consists of five parts 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.450
 namely upper and lower plate more 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.220
 I have this medium plate say 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.840
 and of course the apple which in turn 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.259
 consists of two parts 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.320
 speak stems and the part of the apple 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.299
 yes this child is after the 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.360
 original colors of the iphones held on 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.549
 In addition the power keeps this lower 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.479
 and upper plate I 'll say the glass 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.820
 yes is black and the upload to the 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.700
 of course, too, and this apple logo 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.189
 middle plate is anthracite like that 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.259
 iphone 5 the black iphone 5 just in 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.850
 original look wants from the back 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:53.970
 just that it's all in carbon right now 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:57.390
 the pages are also more in part 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.150
 and always per antenna section 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.110
 I say 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:05.250
 cut off say 12 see below 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:09.780
 By the way, we chained it very well 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.780
 So perfect without any 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.080
 translated or whatever 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.150
 Definitely perfect and cut 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.570
 for the price for this really 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.210
 Well 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:25.230
 So we were counting one two 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:27.040
 three and four parts are the pages 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.580
 I really like it in any case 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.870
 really good especially from the back 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.640
 that 's why I have now in the 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.230
 last time no one would have had any more 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.750
 because it really looks very good 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.830
 yes the front is a matter of taste 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.750
 I must say 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.060
 In the beginning I actually wanted this 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.040
 foil on it 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.660
 However, I thought now I have 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.400
 now I'll give it a try if 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.840
 I do not like it again 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.600
 and so far I do not have them 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.450
 agreed what you should say 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.750
 is under this skin I have again 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.370
 a protective film attached there only with 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.980
 this scene the screen easy 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.769
 not enough protection would be so 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.540
 actual screen 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.489
 and yes that is actually already 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.700
 everything I can say to that as I said 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:15.100
 Quality is 10 of 10 for 10 euro 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.510
 Score in any case as not 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.680
 The glue does not slip 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.790
 somehow or so it does more or 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.700
 protect less 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.620
 of course if it is you without a case now 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.170
 it falls naturally on the ground 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.550
 not so much but definitely 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.820
 I really have to say the ten euro 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:36.130
 are worth 100 percent 200 percent 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:39.100
 Who likes a carbon skin like this 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.290
 should this lay down that I like 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.850
 said very cheap you know certainly 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.310
 the page one dot com 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.299
 So there will be something for several devices 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.799
 offered 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:53.650
 however, that's why it's a hefty price 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:57.250
 in any case with these 26 dollars approx 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.930
 Who likes lust on his carbon skin 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.780
 definitely can with this link 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.030
 have a look over one more if 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.230
 should come ask 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.090
 whether I get them sponsored 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.580
 I bought them myself because I did 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.810
 had interest in this product and 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.670
 it was now actually already 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.989
 for in this video i hope the video 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.489
 you liked and of course 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:20.150
 helped if ever a skin 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.760
