00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:28.400
 we started let's take a spray 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.590
 generous oil in a pan of 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.160
 Teflon so that it will not stick 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.160
 the pig 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.670
 the previous night we cut in strips the 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.670
 pig and the marin masters 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:49.829
 perfect now let's throw the strips 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.829
 of pork in the pan hot 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.600
 we arrange it a bit and we're going to 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.770
 let us authors put us 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.770
 golden 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.039
 after they are watching now you say the 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.039
 let's turn 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.870
 so they take color 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.870
 on the other side 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.780
 after we have flipped again 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.530
 so that all the strips are golden 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.869
 they remain golden brown and crispy 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.829
 we mix that little bit and we're going to 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.829
 proceed to withdraw 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:46.100
 We will save it to reserve in a 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.450
 site for later well now our 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.760
 pan let's make fry 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.670
 the two cloves of garlic 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.530
 well minced 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.930
 We will not let us go to 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.580
 brown or burn and we will put the 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.580
 half moon minced onion 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:08.530
 and we do this so that they release a 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.530
 little we put a little more oil 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.810
 how we see and when our onion 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.120
 are soft 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.700
 let's add the peppers or the 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.099
 Peppers 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.440
 I use the red and green that gives a 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:29.240
 divine flavor 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.240
 While we will mix some 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.590
 we are going to put a little salt 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:48.090
 and now we are going to place the strips of 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:51.200
 our zucchini 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.200
 thus 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.560
 we mix well 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.370
 so that all the vegetables are mixed 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.370
 and the flavors 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.680
 and we are going to proceed 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:16.130
 even for our vegetables 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:20.980
 for approximately 35 minutes 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.980
 so that they do not leave us cooking 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.930
 well past this time we uncover 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.930
 our vegetables 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.510
 and we mix it a little more 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.140
 effect are cooking wonderfully 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.220
 let's try the zucchini to see if 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:48.810
 you remember is when you bite them and 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.810
 it's so crispy like that 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.820
 we are going to add a little more salt 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.820
 to adjust them 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.709
 we mix again 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.860
 so that the salt reaches all the 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:11.730
 vegetables and we are going to cover again 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.730
 a couple more minutes 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.590
 well past this time we reviewed 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.019
 our vegetables 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:25.130
 and they are ready we are going to remove them from 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:29.080
 the pan and let's save 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.080
 let's reserve the 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.160
 for when we go to serve our 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.160
 plate 

00:04:35.739 --> 00:04:41.659
 perfect now we have a broth 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:45.249
 of divine vegetables we are going to add a 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:45.249
 quarter cup of orange juice 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.850
 perfect when the orange juice 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.440
 before the orange juice like 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.280
 We are going to add a little 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.280
 ginger powder 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.990
 we mix a little 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.070
 and when the juice is boiling 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.520
 orange let's add the strips of 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.520
 pork 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:23.910
 let's mix well 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.910
 so that the flavors join 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.340
 we are always cooking this 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:36.289
 medium-high fire 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:40.839
 and we are going to cover 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:40.839
 so that all the flavors mix 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:46.050
 uncover 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.210
 we mix a little and we realize 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:51.410
 that the juice has been cut in half 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.410
 and has expressed a little 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.480
 delicious 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:07.720
 but we're going to know if it is good 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:09.910
 salt and if you do not adjust it to your liking 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:15.210
 let's sprinkle him a little too 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:15.210
 of parsley powder not much 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.040
 and we mix 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:24.889
 now after we mix we're going to 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.020
 turn it off 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:29.379
 and we will proceed to serve our 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.379
 plate 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.520
