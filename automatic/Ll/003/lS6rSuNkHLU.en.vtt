 [Music] 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:22.260
 welcome to these tricks are practical test 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:25.230
 where yesterday at a daf xf 460 euros 6 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.090
 with a standard space cab cabin 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.939
 a drug test forever a lot 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.129
 measurements what do we do to exactly 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.930
 be able to compare how cabins themselves 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:37.680
 relate to each other 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.480
 this is how we measure the height of the trebles 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.430
 tempted to the height to the cabin then 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.809
 equally height of the cabin floor and still 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.370
 much more 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.060
 soon we will also go with the vehicle 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.109
 to drive 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.109

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.240
 [Music] 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.890
 I am 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.530
 Some of the measurements had of course 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.140
 about the driver's workplace 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.850
 chair that we measure with the maximum 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.470
 steps flowed back to 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.330
 see how much space is left for it 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.780
 your legs and especially for your knee or that 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.780
 comfortable 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.650
 we all write that down so that we 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:32.629
 be able to find it again later 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.629
 [Music] 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.759
 in the further development of the cabin 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.549
 to euro 6 it has finished 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.619
 large number of changes made this way 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.360
 it is that at this moment the only one 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:47.289
 truck that you can buy 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.880
 optional with LCD lighting 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.280
 completely new ones 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.990
 Headlight units also develop the familiar 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.250
 pin out in the middle of the window 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.329
 disappeared 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.549
 there is a whole new door for that 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:58.810
 developed and because the track gauge for 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.969
 slightly increased 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.810
 if the day is now also in, you think 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:07.539
 on the side it like you used to be on 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.670
 75 and the 85 series are full 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:12.220
 decided from the preceding series ex 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.750
 where they are not very particularly good 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.209
 not taste as fallow as you would 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.160
 want with the euro 5 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.959
 is now the godfather and also 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.250
 I immediately received a blow 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.110
 light lure is really a cleansed 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.390
 facility where there is a pint in the 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.250
 door comes and it's burglar 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.170
 very little chance that whatever he has 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.170
 finally he likes to do this europe 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.270
 with the arrival of the euro 6 with it too 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.180
 front of the car changed considerably 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.120
 a hefty metal whole came with it 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.340
 rather prominent than in the word 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.770
 but above that there is a special plane 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.110
 made so that the carrier there too 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.520
 can put its own name very big and 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.120
 of course we have a moment there 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.930
 busiest stuck on the new day one 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.020
 among other things 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.180
 improved step 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.459
 they are all made of aluminum and have 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.320
 I here beautiful at the end 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.600
 edges so that you do with your shoes 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.190
 do not paint strips anyway this is something 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.500
 become oblique because many drivers 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.450
 top boarding afterwards and then calls 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.489
 a u means the edge kicks what 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.500
 there then the nice report all small 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.050
 details that make the day of real 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.489
 Users car is water with every test 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.530
 We also always see how easy it is 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.570
 to finish the previous one 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:40.100
 the bag therefore has a number of large ones 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.730
 flaps the steps but you have 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.300
 is no longer necessary 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:48.190
 because from now on every day has one 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:51.440
 beautiful set with which you can effortlessly 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.989
 the window is something without you there 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.470
 on which steps to stand on 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.639
 and that saves a lot in climbing 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.639
 [Music] 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.930

 [Music] 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.270
 h 

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:36.349
 so the test is over we are 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.699
 departed from asten this morning 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:40.599
 and we are now at the highest point 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:40.599
 Belgium on the baraque de fraiture 

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:43.939
 the goal, of course, was to know 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:47.270
 come or this one 

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:52.099
 xf euro 6 does it as well as its 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:53.659
 predecessor the xf 105 euro 5 with hte 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:55.759
 that two engine already had a lot 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:58.550
 parts of the euro 6 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:01.099
 and so this engine would actually be the net 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.120
 so good or please do what better 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:03.949
 we cannot yet get the figures 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.580
 saying what we can say is that 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:09.500
 he runs very smoothly 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.699
 the switching moments are good at the 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.669
 he holds the slope well 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:15.439
 it attracts very nicely and for the rest 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:18.650
 is of course just a real that the 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:21.050
 drivers car not too fancy fancy dancy 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.080
 not proven too many complicated things 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.210
 technology pleasant to operate clear 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.430
 structure is well in hand 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.330
 sends really tight a day so far 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.330
 entirely right 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.800
 [Applause] 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:45.660
 Yes

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.729
 [Music] 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.190
 we are back in amste we have 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.990
 just tilted the cabin 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.599
 to point out that the largest 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.590
 changes from 5 euros to 6 euros 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:09.840
 this tough 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.800
 actually sit under the cabin 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.590
 under the skin 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.960
 A lot has changed to 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:19.110
 to be able to complete your process 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:22.259
 got the mx-13 engine 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:24.180
 egr from some grass treatment 

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:26.819
 the fields have come up slightly and 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.530
 that was necessary because there is more king 

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:30.419
 had to be generated so the one came 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:33.360
 another king package that is also somewhat larger 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:35.009
 was around now 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.289
 engine not very too we already too much him 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:38.550
 eyes to allow them have chassis 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:40.500
 see the newest made what in one 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:43.050
 egg shape loop which gives the engine something again 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.569
 backpockets yet 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:48.509
 that also gave us a broader track 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:49.650
 wide and that gives more pleasure 

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:53.129
 steering because that provides better 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:56.069
 steering precision on is also not unworthy 

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:58.229
 the variable turbo that is there 

00:06:56.069 --> 00:06:59.849
 responsible for this engine so 

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:02.400
 nice search and you really there 

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:04.440
 much driving pleasure from 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.520
 and all in all I still forget 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.669
 a thing 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:11.400
 also the safety this car has one 

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:13.560
 real creases in the event of a collision 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:16.500
 slide the entire cabin pre-programmed 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:19.289
 the back so that you leave 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:21.240
 the subject you dread claps 

00:07:19.289 --> 00:07:22.979
 let's hope it never occurs and 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.229
 that you really only like the fun stuff 

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:27.210
 seeing such a day keeps seeing it 

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:29.009
 drive because that is as a driver anyway 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:30.600
 what you want and that's with this day 

00:07:29.009 --> 00:07:34.309
 excellent arranged
