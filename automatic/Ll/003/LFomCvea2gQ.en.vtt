00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 martin stoll 2 0 in the quarterfinal of 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.629
 krombacher cups at sv waldhof 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.269
 mannheim satisfied 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:11.730
 yes of course so it was not easy 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.620
 Waldhof is currently playing a lot 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.830
 have done well very overrun 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.730
 second time is a man a bit 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.890
 emerged and then tactically very good 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.140
 played and delivered early but me 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.210
 think the game then clean 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.880
 the part played for you what 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.650
 special yes there is my first game 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.380
 from the beginning after my injury was 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.440
 that's something special I have myself 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.469
 enormously pleased to actively participate again 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.200
 can and and then but still won 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.730
 So it has everything fit where I miss 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.850
 at the moment what else do you realize I am 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.489
 not yet at a hundred yes it is so 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.649
 competition practice the general only with 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.649
 come to play 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.430
 you can not train those 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.090
 murdered but you have to 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.949
 Appropriately 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.530
 because it still a bit with security 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.270
 but I think that I am 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.309
 showed that I am here and that 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.080
 you can rely on me if not the man 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.830
 is and now I want to go back 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.780
 attack and bring in action markus 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.760
 is derby against walter recorded 2 too 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.350
 0 away wins since the semi-final 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.780
 a game with two completely different 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.970
 he did not say everything at half-time 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.470
 i think my first one would be the 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.240
 basis laid the base easy for 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.830
 the victory came the game totally 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.390
 have already checked a department 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.159
 guided 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.110
 in the second half clear that you can still 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.030
 times with more power tries the whole 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.439
 and maybe the game too 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.430
 That's why it was not like that anymore 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.290
 easy to play football 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.759
 but we think so anyway 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.960
 would have allowed little security 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.670
 she could drive a bit better 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.170
 but the game can be controlled and 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.790
 won last city 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.470
 you have on some positions the 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.820
 Team changed who were satisfied 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.549
 you with whom today your chance of 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.530
 very beginning but had specially made also 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.479
 to distribute the burden our 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.409
 the clear focus is on the championship 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.299
 want to ascend 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.490
 because we wanted everything under and therefore 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.619
 but also looked here that was 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.570
 let others to play there was 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.770
 no typos midfield dennis 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.939
 Kempe has his first game again 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.009
 All in all, really 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.630
 Proper performance showed it was one 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.870
 Community performance without therefore 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.210
 has protruded 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.850
 because it became as playful good now 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.250
 just recently tsv rosenberg or 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.870
 the fc astoria walldorf does not exist 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.060
 desire opponent 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.410
 Unfortunately, it does not matter how come roses 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.620
 I do not know about that 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.540
 I do not know which one played great 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.730
 national league and that was not even 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.450
 as good a team as you write 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.160
 good coach 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.100
 since we know that it's going to be a tough one 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.130
 but we were always win 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.210
 that was important now i think for here 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.830
 our fans that was 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.000
 Nevertheless, we show that we are there for you 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.140
 that he play this take seriously the 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.760
 was also the game accept 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.780
 and now the cup is playing 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.580
 again no role that comes in the 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.800
 box and it 's about the championship 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.390
 You mentioned the game is good 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.860
 for the rhythm because you are in the 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.430
 to play rhythm on the weekend 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.380
 drinbleibt 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.670
 what else do you take with you for the 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.310
 Saturday against the 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.600
 stuttgart kickers ii number of the 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.480
 first half that was good football 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.770
 can play that was good what did that have 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.410
 was also the people standing in rand 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.500
 can bring very good play though 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.790
 over 60 minutes we prepared a gate 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.920
 have seen that was from the ball yes 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.810
 still can grow but that is 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.250
 important to know that if 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.150
 one we also have failed 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.550
 lock in front of the chest 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.780
 that was how we knew we did not come by that 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.459
 was that can replace and that then 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.690
 others can jump into the breach 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.010
 which gave parallel nor that 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.690
 youth player stuttgarter kickers 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.920
 against arminia bielefeld that went 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.570
 undecided from that is the 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.170
 Table leaders continue to have one 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.090
 meaning 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.320
 yes of course different the opponents 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.300
 Points left it's always good 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.340
 Everything that stands up you have 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.290
 that's we're looking at ourselves 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.360
 Nevertheless, it is nice that, of course 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.550
 now has another game and we have 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.950
 still still first 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:47.220
 that's the best thing 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.220
 older
