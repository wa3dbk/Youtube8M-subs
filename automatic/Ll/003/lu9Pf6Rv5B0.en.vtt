 on a bad day a very bad day 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:16.770
 Black will also hold smoother and tom

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.310
 to cope with 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.850
 the rain clatter day and night 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:31.060
 the whole on everything patience that danger the 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.890
 drought of course also to let 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.950
 can live without heat later 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.400
 they inevitably die than 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.610
 she had great runs of course 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.590
 Layer on sometimes just the lead 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.750
 but then they become just like theirs 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.759
 birth by mother's destiny 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.850
 want to go lottery ticket ticked at the place 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:54.819
 where a shower has a level and 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.069
 they then continue to live quietly 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:58.929
 but then the cold the icy there 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:03.580
 something had to happen 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:07.899
 saddle attention this well so thick that 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.310
 Bella could hear I think I have the World Cup 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.490
 sudden 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.860
 let's go on a journey 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.790
 then they go into mother's lap 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.340
 Earth 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.620
 today it is hot to start the later 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.630
 dig and dig 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.030
 so good for day and night like theirs 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.800
 live off it and that costs of course 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.080
 also 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.110
 this is our 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.110
 only chance in the smallest of the earth 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.090
 we can survive the gap to that 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.640
 long shallow 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.300
 those drunk the cabbage laughed 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.270
 over the low land and the low disappeared 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.340
 in the big hole 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:53.340
 they would never be their sweet country again 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:55.500
 but they venture that before they 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.480
 closed the big hole 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.800
 what counted for the sweeter or 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.810
 everyone was inside now go the bearings 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.030
 not in the hole 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.310
 sell a few very brave to 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.990
 above to over the edge of the large hole 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:16.740
 carpets and fade was low there 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:18.540
 supports frozen and had the hole outside 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.459
 searched for mother's fate 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.700
 because there are not so that are already economical 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:26.880
 downstairs 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:29.820
 progenitor layer had exposed the large 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:33.330
 it runs and would never wake up again 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:35.910
 become as blue as the ones why their 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.770
 save so sad what is the 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.890
 plight of late father 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.510
 for the first time in a long sweet cried 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.960
 the low 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:51.230
 that was the day of the great light 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:54.110
 the song of primal mother's fate was so great 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.370
 that the late makes a plan for her 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.550
 to comfort 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.880
 tastes great and beautiful 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:04.490
 father leaves the blood of seeds low 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:08.240
 mother gave courage and hedge too 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:10.610
 new strength they could do this for and 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:14.030
 started their long journey through it 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:18.200
 the thinnest recommend looking for a new 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:22.370
 country also lasts for thousands of years 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:25.960
 they came across everything 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:29.540
 remnants of past life vegetables service 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.060
 animals so large that the curious 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.410
 low countries needed to expose them 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.870
 Heels 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.730
 she makes it pretty drawings to 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.620
 to record for later how it 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:43.370
 in the past was 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.230
 the late big oliseh crossed one 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.230
 sticky pile 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:51.860
 she was shocked and had to be very careful 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:53.990
 are with fire and poco that they came 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.520
 screws are tunnel upwards to the 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.920
 surface of the earth 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:01.160
 to see if the land there are enough 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:03.500
 was to live forever 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.820
 so arose everywhere 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.260
 so also to the Laga case 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.900
 comes out 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:15.020
 but even do lists and how 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:18.470
 they also liked to see what they were upstairs 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:21.770
 They didn't find one until that one 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:24.470
 day something very strange happens 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:28.130

 wait more and dig in great hurry and 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:48.380
 tunnel up a barrel they saw 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:50.060
 Really exceeded one wildest
