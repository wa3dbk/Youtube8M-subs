00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.150
 communicator 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.330
 almost read the vain mouse 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.420
 essentially a continuation to provide trips to 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.369
 Minute Messi 

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:12.129
 so company 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:13.549
 judging by the street 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:16.549
 because she still hasn't been 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:20.859
 the head is in a hurry to get on New Year 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:22.079
 Christmas sales exactly 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.079
 so delaying the announcement of this model 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:27.809
 then he stirs them all 

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:30.199
 interest 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.199
 but how to see the design of the device 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.240
 not changed much 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.890
 similarity with st model kuteikin more 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.890
 what is noticeable that is to the station salute longer 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.900
 It is natural that the main changes but 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.980
 related to the fact that 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.390
 for use in insanity 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.980
 at the rate 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.980
 finger control system 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.380
 article case screen 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.270
 and transition 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.490
 now there is no 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.090
 we do not see a completely flat surface 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.160
 face side 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.170
 even the boundary between 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.540
 area people are calm and 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.090
 key manager she 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.620
 absolutely not significantly 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.550
 respectively 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.550
 all features inherent in models 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.980
 technology cottage words implemented here 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.370
 rub shell seekers om 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.630
 and even some changes 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.170
 more precisely some all the changes that 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.620
 were 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.490
 narrated 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.970
 already for the apparatus I think that he is here 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:36.990
 also have 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.110
 it concerns 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.420
 address books with her 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.910
 Ai similar background 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.500
 system 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.740
 and 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.230
 scrolling pictures 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.000
 watching videos and some other 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.970
 functions that is 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.950
 but here we see the cubs box office for Ricci 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.160
 All of them 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.220
 all new models 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.380
 catching up with the sole optimizes circuit 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.160
 interface gradually new 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.250
 the changes themselves are very interesting and in 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.729
 future will be seen 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.209
 even greater product similarity 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.120
 three goals was replaced by the central 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.389
 key now 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:18.999
 use cursor 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:20.799
 perform it 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:22.620
 mouse function will not work now 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.109
 to the central key 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:26.429
 for me 

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:29.139
 greatest pressure and words 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:31.209
 ergonomics of the sending unit 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:32.819
 if you could notice 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.559
 there is no habit of poems key 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:37.910
 Start menu and hand movement button 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.140
 Of course, if you wish, you can about these 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.039
 benish Nikolai Shishkina 

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:45.199
 The specified actions are several 

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:47.389
 surprised that in the company 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:49.449
 in which he preached 

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:51.509
 use of informal block 

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:54.279
 for almost all of their models 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:57.279
 decided to remove these two keys possible 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.109
 the reason lies in the fact that the model 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:01.449
 insomnia 

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:04.289
 first network as navigation 

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:06.209
 the company believes that the device will not 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.419
 use 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:11.309
 in other areas 

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:13.439
 you can say a lot of nice words 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:16.909
 the camera which 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:19.549
 is practically the best for the mind is weak 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.449
 devices as usual always this 2 

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:24.369
 but 

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:26.309
 country earlier we will write most likely 

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:27.799
 two 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.219
 let me remind you, but with this video you are reading 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:31.819
 preliminary review 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.869
 which will be updated on the basis of 

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:36.599
 media release but throw 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.469
 which goes on sale is possible in 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:39.779
 november december 

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:41.529
 accurate data is too early 

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:41.919
