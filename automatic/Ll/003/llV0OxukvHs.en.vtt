what<00:00:18.420> I'll<00:00:18.510> be<00:00:18.630> doing<00:00:18.750> for<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.080> test<00:00:19.350> is

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
what I'll be doing for the test is

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.609 
what I'll be doing for the test is
playing<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:20.010> 480p<00:00:20.670> flash<00:00:21.420> video<00:00:21.840> over<00:00:22.199> Wi-Fi

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
playing a 480p flash video over Wi-Fi

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.130 
playing a 480p flash video over Wi-Fi
connection<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.939> video<00:00:24.180> itself<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:24.750> about<00:00:24.960> 2

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
connection the video itself is about 2

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.750 
connection the video itself is about 2
minutes<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.560> 40<00:00:25.859> seconds<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.430> it's<00:00:26.550> going<00:00:26.699> to

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
minutes and 40 seconds and it's going to

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.790 
minutes and 40 seconds and it's going to
repeat<00:00:27.119> at<00:00:27.359> five<00:00:27.630> minute<00:00:27.960> intervals<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.590> I

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
repeat at five minute intervals and I

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.960 
repeat at five minute intervals and I
thought<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.070> would<00:00:29.160> be<00:00:29.250> appropriate<00:00:29.369> this

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
thought it would be appropriate this

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.630 
thought it would be appropriate this
test<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:30.449> just<00:00:30.599> meant<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.960> simulate<00:00:31.199> a

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
test is just meant to simulate a

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.860 
test is just meant to simulate a
scenario<00:00:32.640> or<00:00:32.730> somebody<00:00:33.149> watches<00:00:33.540> YouTube

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870

videos all day so let me explain a
little<00:00:36.540> bit<00:00:36.719> how<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:36.899> set<00:00:37.260> up<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.559> test<00:00:37.829> first

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
little bit how I set up this test first

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.610 
little bit how I set up this test first
I'm<00:00:38.370> using<00:00:38.550> period<00:00:39.050> which<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.260> hope<00:00:40.410> I'm<00:00:40.590> saying

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
I'm using period which I hope I'm saying

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.470 
I'm using period which I hope I'm saying
that<00:00:40.860> right<00:00:40.980> it's<00:00:41.340> an<00:00:41.460> open<00:00:41.730> source<00:00:41.879> QuickTime

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480

script to automate this test I can post
a<00:01:08.130> code<00:01:08.340> if<00:01:08.490> anybody's<00:01:08.939> interested<00:01:09.119> but

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
a code if anybody's interested but

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.090 
a code if anybody's interested but
basically<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.200> starts<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.590> five<00:01:10.830> minute

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
basically it starts a five minute

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
countdown at the beginning of the script

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.620 
countdown at the beginning of the script
then<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.590> opens<00:01:13.860> QuickTime<00:01:14.340> then<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.330> opens

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
then it opens QuickTime then it opens

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.020 
then it opens QuickTime then it opens
the<00:01:15.780> flash<00:01:16.020> file<00:01:16.350> then<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.220> logs<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.610> current

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
the flash file then it logs the current

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.899 
the flash file then it logs the current
time<00:01:18.530> plays<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.740> file<00:01:20.009> which<00:01:20.280> again<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.670> about

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
time plays the file which again is about

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.749 
time plays the file which again is about
two<00:01:21.119> minutes<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.509> 40<00:01:21.810> seconds<00:01:22.610> closes<00:01:23.610> the

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
two minutes and 40 seconds closes the

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.580 
two minutes and 40 seconds closes the
file<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.420> then<00:01:24.630> after<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.080> five-minute

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
file and then after that five-minute

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.280 
file and then after that five-minute
countdown<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.159> done<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.549> will<00:01:26.729> repeat<00:01:27.290> and

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
countdown is done it will repeat and

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.630 
countdown is done it will repeat and
we're<00:01:28.439> almost<00:01:28.590> ready<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.950> start<00:01:29.250> but<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.430> just

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
the batteries again 2011 model I've had

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.819 
the batteries again 2011 model I've had
it<00:01:44.250> for<00:01:44.430> about<00:01:44.520> 11<00:01:44.970> months<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.540> it's<00:01:45.750> got<00:01:46.140> 53

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
cycles on it the health is 95% which is

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.350 
cycles on it the health is 95% which is
pretty<00:01:49.619> darn<00:01:49.829> good

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
pretty darn good

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.319 
pretty darn good
44<00:01:51.360> 53<00:01:51.930> milliamp<00:01:52.350> hours<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.729> 100%

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
44 53 milliamp hours and it is 100%

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.940 
44 53 milliamp hours and it is 100%
charged<00:01:54.810> right<00:01:55.049> now<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.290> can<00:01:55.530> see<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.770> green

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
charged right now you can see the green

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.770 
charged right now you can see the green
light<00:01:56.130> right<00:01:56.340> there<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:57.090> new<00:01:57.210> model<00:01:57.360> for

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
light right there and the new model for

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.609 
light right there and the new model for
cycles<00:01:58.290> health<00:01:58.590> 100%<00:01:59.840> 48:32<00:02:00.840> milliamp<00:02:01.439> hour

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
cycles health 100% 48:32 milliamp hour

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.649 
cycles health 100% 48:32 milliamp hour
so<00:02:02.009> it's<00:02:02.790> got<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.030> bit<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.240> an<00:02:03.420> advantage

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
so it's got a bit of an advantage

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.389 
so it's got a bit of an advantage
already<00:02:04.229> but<00:02:04.439> there's<00:02:04.649> really<00:02:04.860> nothing<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.340> can

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
already but there's really nothing I can

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.160 
already but there's really nothing I can
do<00:02:05.640> about<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:05.909> so<00:02:06.090> just<00:02:06.299> keep<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:06.990> in<00:02:07.049> mind

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
do about that so just keep that in mind

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.990 
do about that so just keep that in mind
when<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.829> results<00:02:08.250> come<00:02:08.369> around<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.849> also

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
when the results come around I also

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.820 
when the results come around I also
wanted<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.450> note<00:02:09.660> I've<00:02:09.869> got<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.229> screens<00:02:10.560> I

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
wanted to note I've got the screens I

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.080 
wanted to note I've got the screens I
know<00:02:10.890> they<00:02:11.099> look<00:02:11.250> bright<00:02:11.489> but<00:02:11.700> they're<00:02:11.849> set<00:02:12.060> at

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
know they look bright but they're set at

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.430 
know they look bright but they're set at
half<00:02:12.390> brightness

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
half brightness

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.230

listen to these videos going for the
next<00:02:35.690> several<00:02:36.690> hours<00:02:36.930> so<00:02:37.320> I<00:02:37.350> just<00:02:37.740> plugged<00:02:38.040> in

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
next several hours so I just plugged in

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.600 
next several hours so I just plugged in
a<00:02:38.970> head<00:02:39.480> simple<00:02:39.900> headphone<00:02:40.260> cable<00:02:40.740> to<00:02:41.430> both

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
a head simple headphone cable to both

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.570 
a head simple headphone cable to both
models<00:02:42.060> so<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:42.570> I<00:02:42.720> don't<00:02:42.810> have<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.200> hear<00:02:43.410> it

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
models so that I don't have to hear it

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.220 
models so that I don't have to hear it
okay<00:02:44.580> we're<00:02:44.760> ready<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:45.120> start<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.660> test<00:02:45.690> I'm

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
okay we're ready to start the test I'm

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.000 
okay we're ready to start the test I'm
gonna<00:02:46.380> unplug<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:46.890> power<00:02:47.070> from<00:02:47.460> both<00:02:47.640> laptops

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
gonna unplug the power from both laptops

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.230 
gonna unplug the power from both laptops
so<00:02:50.010> they're<00:02:50.160> both<00:02:50.280> running<00:02:50.670> on<00:02:50.790> battery<00:02:51.150> power

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
so they're both running on battery power

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.470 
so they're both running on battery power
now<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:51.720> I'm<00:02:52.140> going<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.320> start<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:53.040> scripts

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.600 

and<00:02:57.480> what<00:02:58.110> it<00:02:58.200> does<00:02:58.410> is<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:58.830> opens<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.340> video

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
and what it does is it opens the video

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.610 
and what it does is it opens the video
and<00:02:59.990> after<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.500> video<00:03:01.740> has<00:03:01.950> loaded<00:03:02.240> it<00:03:03.240> will

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
and after the video has loaded it will

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.090 
and after the video has loaded it will
start<00:03:04.620> playing<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.010> video<00:03:06.140> so<00:03:07.140> I'm<00:03:07.500> not<00:03:07.710> using

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
start playing the video so I'm not using

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.550 
start playing the video so I'm not using
a<00:03:08.190> timer<00:03:08.520> here<00:03:08.880> or<00:03:09.090> stopwatch<00:03:09.330> because<00:03:10.080> again

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
a timer here or stopwatch because again

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.970 
a timer here or stopwatch because again
I<00:03:10.770> put<00:03:11.580> in<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.790> script<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.270> log<00:03:12.770> when<00:03:13.770> each

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
I put in the script to log when each

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.620 
I put in the script to log when each
video<00:03:14.280> starts<00:03:14.730> so<00:03:14.850> I'll<00:03:15.030> be<00:03:15.150> able<00:03:15.270> to<00:03:15.390> check

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
video starts so I'll be able to check

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.650 
video starts so I'll be able to check
and<00:03:15.810> see<00:03:16.190> when<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.370> last<00:03:17.550> video<00:03:18.000> was<00:03:18.360> played

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
and see when the last video was played

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.360 
and see when the last video was played
so<00:03:18.990> I'm<00:03:19.140> gonna<00:03:19.290> actually<00:03:19.500> walk<00:03:19.860> away<00:03:20.100> and<00:03:20.310> it

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
so I'm gonna actually walk away and it

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.620 
so I'm gonna actually walk away and it
doesn't<00:03:20.640> matter<00:03:20.790> if<00:03:20.940> I'm<00:03:21.180> here<00:03:21.450> when<00:03:21.480> the

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
doesn't matter if I'm here when the

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.330 
doesn't matter if I'm here when the
battery<00:03:21.930> dies<00:03:22.170> or<00:03:22.350> not<00:03:22.500> after<00:03:22.740> I<00:03:22.920> turn<00:03:23.190> it<00:03:23.310> back

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
battery dies or not after I turn it back

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.090 
battery dies or not after I turn it back
on<00:03:23.610> I'll<00:03:24.270> be<00:03:24.480> able<00:03:24.570> to<00:03:24.750> check<00:03:24.959> and<00:03:25.260> compare

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
on I'll be able to check and compare

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.740 
on I'll be able to check and compare
when<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.310> first<00:03:26.550> video<00:03:26.820> was<00:03:27.000> played<00:03:27.240> to<00:03:27.510> when

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
when the first video was played to when

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.710 
when the first video was played to when
the<00:03:27.870> last<00:03:28.050> video<00:03:28.380> was<00:03:28.620> played<00:03:29.090> so<00:03:30.090> you<00:03:30.180> can<00:03:30.420> see

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
the last video was played so you can see

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.900 
the last video was played so you can see
hopefully<00:03:31.110> now<00:03:31.530> that<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:32.160> videos<00:03:32.520> have

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
hopefully now that the videos have

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.630 
hopefully now that the videos have
started<00:03:33.450> playing<00:03:33.890> they're<00:03:34.890> moving<00:03:35.310> around<00:03:35.400> a

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
started playing they're moving around a

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.300 
started playing they're moving around a
little<00:03:35.760> bit<00:03:36.030> and<00:03:36.500> that's<00:03:37.500> pretty<00:03:37.980> much<00:03:38.100> all<00:03:38.250> I

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
little bit and that's pretty much all I

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.920 
little bit and that's pretty much all I
need<00:03:38.490> to<00:03:38.580> do<00:03:38.700> for<00:03:38.940> now<00:03:39.060> I'm<00:03:39.270> gonna<00:03:39.390> walk<00:03:39.630> away

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
need to do for now I'm gonna walk away

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.870 
need to do for now I'm gonna walk away
and<00:03:40.170> come<00:03:40.230> back<00:03:41.070> after<00:03:41.400> they're<00:03:41.760> dead<00:03:43.880> and

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
and come back after they're dead and

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.970 
and come back after they're dead and
we're<00:03:45.390> back<00:03:45.570> several<00:03:45.959> hours<00:03:46.560> have<00:03:46.739> passed

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
we're back several hours have passed

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.940 
we're back several hours have passed
isn't<00:03:47.400> that<00:03:47.489> a<00:03:47.520> nice<00:03:47.730> trick<00:03:48.590> these<00:03:49.590> things<00:03:49.800> are

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
isn't that a nice trick these things are

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.130 
isn't that a nice trick these things are
dead<00:03:50.130> as<00:03:50.250> doornails<00:03:50.430> and<00:03:51.090> I<00:03:51.330> can<00:03:51.510> confirm<00:03:51.720> that

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
dead as doornails and I can confirm that

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.010 
dead as doornails and I can confirm that
the<00:03:52.290> new<00:03:52.440> model<00:03:52.620> did<00:03:53.040> indeed<00:03:53.489> win<00:03:53.790> but<00:03:54.720> by<00:03:54.870> how

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
the new model did indeed win but by how

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.110 
the new model did indeed win but by how
much<00:03:55.050> we're<00:03:55.680> gonna<00:03:55.980> find<00:03:56.310> out<00:03:56.459> I'm<00:03:56.700> gonna<00:03:56.850> plug

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
much we're gonna find out I'm gonna plug

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.660 
much we're gonna find out I'm gonna plug
them<00:03:57.300> in<00:03:57.420> turn<00:03:58.260> them<00:03:58.440> on<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:58.890> show<00:03:59.370> you<00:03:59.430> the

55 minutes and 12 seconds between both
models<00:04:44.039> if<00:04:44.909> you<00:04:45.210> take<00:04:45.419> into<00:04:45.569> account<00:04:45.659> that<00:04:46.080> the

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 
models if you take into account that the

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.860 
models if you take into account that the
old<00:04:46.379> model<00:04:46.889> had<00:04:47.129> 95<00:04:47.729> percent<00:04:48.240> battery<00:04:48.419> health

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
old model had 95 percent battery health

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.990 
old model had 95 percent battery health
you<00:04:49.680> can<00:04:49.860> do<00:04:49.979> some<00:04:50.159> additional<00:04:50.580> math<00:04:50.759> and

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
you can do some additional math and

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.679 
you can do some additional math and
figure<00:04:51.270> out<00:04:51.889> 4<00:04:52.889> hours<00:04:53.219> and<00:04:53.400> 41<00:04:53.789> minutes<00:04:53.909> and<00:04:54.389> 17

00:04:54.679 --> 00:04:54.689 
figure out 4 hours and 41 minutes and 17

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:58.040 
figure out 4 hours and 41 minutes and 17
seconds<00:04:55.259> divide<00:04:55.620> that<00:04:55.800> by<00:04:55.979> 95<00:04:56.550> then<00:04:57.509> multiply

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
seconds divide that by 95 then multiply

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.080 
seconds divide that by 95 then multiply
by<00:04:58.229> a<00:04:58.259> hundred<00:04:58.349> comes<00:04:58.919> out<00:04:59.069> to<00:04:59.219> about<00:04:59.490> 4<00:04:59.879> hours

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
by a hundred comes out to about 4 hours

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.830 
by a hundred comes out to about 4 hours
and<00:05:00.590> 56<00:05:01.590> minutes<00:05:01.909> so<00:05:02.909> we<00:05:03.060> can<00:05:03.270> guess<00:05:03.509> that's

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
and 56 minutes so we can guess that's

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.320 
and 56 minutes so we can guess that's
how<00:05:04.020> long<00:05:04.259> this<00:05:04.500> would<00:05:04.650> last<00:05:04.860> if<00:05:05.250> it<00:05:05.400> had<00:05:05.580> 100%

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
how long this would last if it had 100%

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.749 
how long this would last if it had 100%
battery<00:05:06.509> health<00:05:07.099> even<00:05:08.099> if<00:05:08.310> you<00:05:08.430> take<00:05:08.610> that

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:08.759 
battery health even if you take that

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:10.790 
battery health even if you take that
number<00:05:08.969> into<00:05:09.270> consideration<00:05:10.110> the<00:05:10.319> new<00:05:10.469> model

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
number into consideration the new model

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.740 
number into consideration the new model
still<00:05:11.099> lasts<00:05:11.490> at<00:05:11.580> 40<00:05:11.969> minutes<00:05:12.270> longer<00:05:12.569> than

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
still lasts at 40 minutes longer than

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.779 
still lasts at 40 minutes longer than
that<00:05:13.050> so<00:05:13.919> there<00:05:14.159> you<00:05:14.279> have<00:05:14.310> it<00:05:14.490> my<00:05:14.729> very

that so there you have it my very

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:16.790 
that so there you have it my very
unscientific<00:05:15.620> demonstration<00:05:16.620> and

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800

conclusion that the new 2012 model is

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.890 
conclusion that the new 2012 model is
more<00:05:19.949> power<00:05:20.159> efficient<00:05:20.789> than<00:05:21.000> the<00:05:21.120> 2011<00:05:21.750> model

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
more power efficient than the 2011 model

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.219 
more power efficient than the 2011 model
