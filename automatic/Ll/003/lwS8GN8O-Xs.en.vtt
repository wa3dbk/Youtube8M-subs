the things that I have been

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.760 
the things that I have been
experimenting<00:00:06.810> with<00:00:06.839> and<00:00:07.290> just<00:00:07.440> kind<00:00:07.710> of

explain some pitfalls I run into some
changes<00:00:12.000> I've<00:00:12.120> made<00:00:12.330> along<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.750> way<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.349> the

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
changes I've made along the way and the

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.430 
changes I've made along the way and the
pursuit<00:00:14.009> of<00:00:14.040> raised<00:00:14.820> bed<00:00:15.059> gardening<00:00:15.630> kind<00:00:16.379> of

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
pursuit of raised bed gardening kind of

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.590 
pursuit of raised bed gardening kind of
automatic<00:00:17.039> irrigation<00:00:17.250> or<00:00:18.000> at<00:00:18.090> least<00:00:18.270> closer

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
automatic irrigation or at least closer

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.490 
automatic irrigation or at least closer
to<00:00:18.720> automatic<00:00:19.609> what<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.640> found<00:00:20.970> as<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.750> was<00:00:21.779> kind

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
to automatic what I found as I was kind

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.439 
to automatic what I found as I was kind
of<00:00:22.619> going<00:00:22.800> through<00:00:22.949> different<00:00:23.760> methods<00:00:24.180> was

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
of going through different methods was

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.630 
of going through different methods was
that<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.930> had<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.590> couple<00:00:25.980> different<00:00:26.250> layouts

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
that I had a couple different layouts

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.779 
that I had a couple different layouts
that<00:00:26.970> seemed<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.300> work<00:00:27.330> well<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:28.789> this

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
that seemed to work well and this

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.959 
that seemed to work well and this
particular<00:00:30.119> layout<00:00:30.599> was<00:00:31.019> designed<00:00:31.439> for

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:31.969 
particular layout was designed for

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:35.240 
particular layout was designed for
squash<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.360> zucchini<00:00:33.390> plants<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.440> needed

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
squash and zucchini plants that needed

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.900 
squash and zucchini plants that needed
to<00:00:35.340> have<00:00:35.520> their<00:00:36.000> their<00:00:36.750> roots<00:00:36.989> watered<00:00:37.500> and

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
to have their their roots watered and

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.720 
to have their their roots watered and
what<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:38.940> found<00:00:39.239> was<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.960> if<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.649> if<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.370> created

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
what I found was that if I if I created

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.860 
what I found was that if I if I created
holes<00:00:42.390> with<00:00:42.860> 1/16<00:00:43.860> inch<00:00:44.070> drill<00:00:44.489> bits<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:45.120> could

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
holes with 1/16 inch drill bits I could

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.229 
holes with 1/16 inch drill bits I could
more<00:00:46.050> easily<00:00:46.079> create<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.829> soaker<00:00:47.160> system<00:00:47.789> that

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
more easily create a soaker system that

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.799 
more easily create a soaker system that
would<00:00:48.390> work<00:00:48.539> well<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:50.090> kind<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.270> variety<00:00:51.480> of

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
would work well and kind of a variety of

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.709 
would work well and kind of a variety of
different<00:00:52.530> settings<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:54.360> thing<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.539> I

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
different settings and the thing that I

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.750 
different settings and the thing that I
couldn't<00:00:54.989> do<00:00:55.110> with<00:00:55.289> soaker<00:00:55.559> hoses<00:00:55.739> which<00:00:56.640> is

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
couldn't do with soaker hoses which is

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.790 
couldn't do with soaker hoses which is
why<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:56.910> turn<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.239> PDC<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.500> couldn't

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
why I turn to PDC is I couldn't

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.240 
why I turn to PDC is I couldn't
necessarily<00:00:59.789> get<00:00:59.940> an<00:01:00.120> exact<00:01:00.600> section<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:02.219> be

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
necessarily get an exact section to be

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.420 
necessarily get an exact section to be
watered<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.480> as<00:01:04.290> we<00:01:04.500> see<00:01:04.710> here<00:01:05.070> we<00:01:05.280> have

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
watered and so as we see here we have

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.320 
watered and so as we see here we have
sections<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.909> PVC<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.390> haven't<00:01:06.960> been

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
sections of PVC that haven't been

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.490 
sections of PVC that haven't been
drilled<00:01:09.330> into<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.900> other<00:01:09.960> sections<00:01:10.320> that

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
drilled into and other sections that

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.679 
drilled into and other sections that
have<00:01:10.710> been<00:01:10.950> drilled<00:01:11.189> into<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.510> I'll<00:01:12.659> just

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
have been drilled into and so I'll just

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.510 
have been drilled into and so I'll just
kind<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.049> show<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.409> variety<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:14.010> different

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
kind of show you a variety of different

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.969 
kind of show you a variety of different
angles<00:01:14.850> here<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.900> can<00:01:16.110> pause<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.860> rewind

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
angles here so you can pause and rewind

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:17.929 
angles here so you can pause and rewind
as<00:01:17.460> needed

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
as needed

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.460 
as needed
we<00:01:18.450> see<00:01:18.630> these<00:01:18.869> portals<00:01:19.400> haven't<00:01:20.400> survived

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
we see these portals haven't survived

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.450 
we see these portals haven't survived
I'm<00:01:22.470> still<00:01:22.710> trying<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:22.979> figure<00:01:23.159> out<00:01:23.369> exactly

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
I'm still trying to figure out exactly

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.359 
I'm still trying to figure out exactly
why<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:23.939> is<00:01:24.270> I'm<00:01:24.659> kind<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.619> clueless<00:01:26.100> when

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
why that is I'm kind of a clueless when

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.249 
why that is I'm kind of a clueless when
it<00:01:26.430> comes<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.909> soil<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.630> what<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.869> do<00:01:27.990> there

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
it comes to soil and what to do there

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.350 
it comes to soil and what to do there
and<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.860> guess<00:01:29.369> I've<00:01:29.520> been<00:01:29.549> focusing<00:01:30.030> perhaps

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
and I guess I've been focusing perhaps

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.850 
and I guess I've been focusing perhaps
too<00:01:30.540> much<00:01:30.720> on<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.960> irrigation<00:01:31.200> side<00:01:31.740> of

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
too much on the irrigation side of

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.270 
too much on the irrigation side of
things<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.150> am<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.329> tinkerer<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.200> guilty<00:01:35.159> of

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
things but I am a tinkerer so guilty of

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.260 
things but I am a tinkerer so guilty of
that

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
that

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.429 
that
so<00:01:36.600> overall<00:01:37.470> structure<00:01:37.799> we<00:01:38.400> have<00:01:39.200> source<00:01:40.200> line

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
so overall structure we have source line

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.670 
so overall structure we have source line
coming<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.720> that<00:01:42.720> tees<00:01:43.439> off

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
coming in and that tees off

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.670 
coming in and that tees off
three-quarter<00:01:44.490> inch<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.850> 3/4<00:01:45.270> inch<00:01:45.420> tee<00:01:45.689> up<00:01:46.290> to

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
three-quarter inch to 3/4 inch tee up to

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.910 
three-quarter inch to 3/4 inch tee up to
a<00:01:47.159> shutoff<00:01:47.790> valve<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.840> will<00:01:48.990> allow<00:01:49.259> me<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.500> as

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
a shutoff valve that will allow me to as

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.980 
a shutoff valve that will allow me to as
I<00:01:50.100> go<00:01:50.610> all<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.090> way<00:01:51.119> on<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.390> gives<00:01:51.720> me<00:01:51.810> more

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
I go all the way on it gives me more

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.960 
I go all the way on it gives me more
pressure<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.680> can<00:01:52.890> have<00:01:53.070> variable

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
pressure and I can have variable

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.700 
pressure and I can have variable
pressure<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:54.509> simply<00:01:54.810> by<00:01:54.960> turning<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:55.500> at

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
pressure just simply by turning this at

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.740 
pressure just simply by turning this at
different<00:01:56.009> angles<00:01:56.479> this<00:01:57.479> comes<00:01:57.780> up<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.229> a

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
different angles this comes up to a

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.780 
different angles this comes up to a
ninety-degree<00:02:01.100> it<00:02:02.100> comes<00:02:02.310> over<00:02:02.400> to<00:02:02.549> another

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
ninety-degree it comes over to another

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.920 
ninety-degree it comes over to another
90<00:02:03.119> degree<00:02:03.500> comes<00:02:04.500> over<00:02:04.830> to<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.880> reducing<00:02:06.659> tee

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
90 degree comes over to a reducing tee

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.570 
90 degree comes over to a reducing tee
so<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.350> goes<00:02:07.500> from<00:02:07.619> three-quarter<00:02:08.220> inch<00:02:08.369> down

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
so it goes from three-quarter inch down

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.910 
so it goes from three-quarter inch down
to<00:02:08.700> one<00:02:08.910> inch<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.450> by<00:02:10.200> having<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.649> source

the<00:02:13.350> way<00:02:13.380> across<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:14.220> then<00:02:14.819> capping<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:15.450> off

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
the way across and then capping that off

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.470 
the way across and then capping that off
with<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.870> cap<00:02:16.170> at<00:02:16.319> the<00:02:16.380> end<00:02:16.620> I<00:02:16.980> can<00:02:17.790> get<00:02:17.970> more

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
with a cap at the end I can get more

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.190 
with a cap at the end I can get more

can take what I've done and I can I can

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.340 
can take what I've done and I can I can
rotate<00:02:35.880> around<00:02:36.209> if<00:02:36.690> I<00:02:36.780> want<00:02:36.959> to<00:02:37.019> do<00:02:37.110> to<00:02:37.230> go

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
rotate around if I want to do to go

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.470 
rotate around if I want to do to go

straight up in the air I could I could

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.810 
straight up in the air I could I could
rotate<00:02:39.660> this<00:02:40.019> down<00:02:40.290> as<00:02:40.500> well<00:02:40.739> and<00:02:41.010> then<00:02:41.640> at<00:02:41.730> the

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
rotate this down as well and then at the

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.370 
rotate this down as well and then at the
end<00:02:41.850> of<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.030> season<00:02:42.390> I<00:02:42.510> can<00:02:42.540> break<00:02:43.200> it<00:02:43.350> down

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
end of the season I can break it down

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.080 
end of the season I can break it down
and<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:44.519> can<00:02:45.110> store<00:02:46.110> pretty<00:02:46.410> easily<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:47.090> that's

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
and I can store pretty easily so that's

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.640 
and I can store pretty easily so that's
another<00:02:48.360> feature<00:02:48.570> I'd<00:02:48.840> like<00:02:48.989> to<00:02:49.140> comment<00:02:49.410> on

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
another feature I'd like to comment on

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.979 
another feature I'd like to comment on
is<00:02:49.950> no<00:02:50.130> glue<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:51.330> see<00:02:51.510> with<00:02:51.630> no<00:02:51.780> glue

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
is no glue and you see with no glue

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.690 
is no glue and you see with no glue
there's<00:02:52.260> no<00:02:52.410> leaking<00:02:52.800> anywhere<00:02:53.280> so<00:02:53.519> there's

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
there's no leaking anywhere so there's

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.910 
there's no leaking anywhere so there's
not<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:53.850> problem<00:02:54.090> with<00:02:54.510> that<00:02:54.690> so<00:02:54.989> you're<00:02:55.140> pretty

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
not a problem with that so you're pretty

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.220 
not a problem with that so you're pretty
flexible<00:02:56.220> long-term<00:02:57.030> so<00:02:57.569> once<00:02:57.750> I'm<00:02:57.900> done<00:02:58.050> with

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
flexible long-term so once I'm done with

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.420 
flexible long-term so once I'm done with
one<00:02:58.440> bed<00:03:00.500> let's<00:03:01.500> go<00:03:01.739> ahead<00:03:01.800> and<00:03:01.950> turn<00:03:02.069> this<00:03:02.250> one

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
one bed let's go ahead and turn this one

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.220 
one bed let's go ahead and turn this one
on<00:03:02.459> first<00:03:02.790> so<00:03:03.000> I'll<00:03:03.090> turn<00:03:03.300> on<00:03:03.330> the<00:03:03.600> second<00:03:04.019> bed

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
on first so I'll turn on the second bed

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.759 
on first so I'll turn on the second bed
and<00:03:04.560> then<00:03:05.900> probably<00:03:06.900> get<00:03:07.320> you<00:03:07.440> to<00:03:07.530> a<00:03:07.560> point

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
and then probably get you to a point

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.920 
and then probably get you to a point
where<00:03:08.010> you're<00:03:08.160> I'm<00:03:09.120> about<00:03:09.360> to<00:03:09.510> get<00:03:09.660> sick<00:03:09.900> with

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
where you're I'm about to get sick with

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.370 
where you're I'm about to get sick with
all<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.290> crazy<00:03:10.500> camera<00:03:10.890> angles<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:12.380> for

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
all the crazy camera angles and for

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.640 
all the crazy camera angles and for
lettuce<00:03:13.680> for<00:03:13.829> example<00:03:14.540> what<00:03:15.540> I<00:03:15.570> found<00:03:15.870> was<00:03:16.260> I

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
lettuce for example what I found was I

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.199 
lettuce for example what I found was I
can<00:03:17.519> I<00:03:18.049> can<00:03:19.049> alternate<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.890> holes<00:03:20.160> so<00:03:20.850> you<00:03:20.880> see

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
can I can alternate the holes so you see

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.990 
can I can alternate the holes so you see
along<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:21.989> top<00:03:22.019> of<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.730> PVC<00:03:23.730> pipe<00:03:23.970> here

along the top of the PVC pipe here

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.759 
along the top of the PVC pipe here
there's<00:03:24.450> not<00:03:24.570> a<00:03:24.600> hole<00:03:24.840> along<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:25.260> top<00:03:25.500> but

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
there's not a hole along the top but

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.470 
there's not a hole along the top but
instead<00:03:26.130> I<00:03:26.400> go<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.329> alternate<00:03:28.190> perhaps<00:03:29.480> maybe

three-quarter<00:03:52.799> inch<00:03:52.829> that<00:03:53.160> goes<00:03:53.220> between<00:03:53.700> all

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
three-quarter inch that goes between all

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.979 
three-quarter inch that goes between all
the<00:03:54.090> beds<00:03:54.329> and<00:03:54.660> then<00:03:55.350> it<00:03:56.239> comes<00:03:57.239> up<00:03:57.480> to<00:03:57.900> your

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
the beds and then it comes up to your

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.930 
the beds and then it comes up to your
ninety<00:03:58.260> degree<00:03:58.500> angle<00:03:58.829> this<00:03:59.100> time<00:03:59.160> it<00:03:59.640> shoots

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
ninety degree angle this time it shoots

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.530 
ninety degree angle this time it shoots
all<00:04:00.209> the<00:04:00.239> way<00:04:00.630> down<00:04:00.959> the<00:04:01.200> bed<00:04:01.440> and<00:04:02.269> so<00:04:03.269> I<00:04:03.299> have<00:04:03.510> a

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
all the way down the bed and so I have a

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.150 
all the way down the bed and so I have a
three-quarter<00:04:04.170> inch<00:04:04.200> source<00:04:04.560> pipe<00:04:04.799> that<00:04:05.010> goes

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
three-quarter inch source pipe that goes

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.420 
three-quarter inch source pipe that goes
all<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.340> way<00:04:05.430> down

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
all the way down

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.640 
all the way down
again<00:04:07.030> with<00:04:07.540> reducing<00:04:08.080> teas<00:04:08.349> from

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
again with reducing teas from

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.430 
again with reducing teas from
three-quarter<00:04:09.220> inch<00:04:09.400> down<00:04:09.670> to<00:04:09.879> 1/2<00:04:10.450> inch<00:04:10.750> so

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
three-quarter inch down to 1/2 inch so

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.009 
three-quarter inch down to 1/2 inch so
the<00:04:11.590> T<00:04:11.769> joint<00:04:12.010> is<00:04:12.310> what<00:04:12.519> allows<00:04:13.420> it<00:04:13.450> to<00:04:13.659> reduce

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
the T joint is what allows it to reduce

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.460 
the T joint is what allows it to reduce
at<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.290> same<00:04:14.470> time<00:04:14.769> and<00:04:15.630> what<00:04:16.630> I<00:04:16.660> found<00:04:16.989> was<00:04:17.290> I

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
at the same time and what I found was I

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.689 
at the same time and what I found was I
could<00:04:17.650> do<00:04:17.829> a<00:04:18.130> couple<00:04:18.699> different<00:04:19.090> things<00:04:20.699> well

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:21.699 
could do a couple different things well

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:26.219 
could do a couple different things well
I'm<00:04:21.790> doing<00:04:22.630> one<00:04:22.930> row<00:04:23.260> per<00:04:24.330> pipe<00:04:25.330> or<00:04:25.870> two<00:04:26.020> two

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
I'm doing one row per pipe or two two

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.010 
I'm doing one row per pipe or two two
rows<00:04:26.410> per<00:04:26.680> pipe<00:04:26.949> at<00:04:27.190> this<00:04:27.370> point<00:04:27.699> and<00:04:28.000> we<00:04:28.870> can

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
rows per pipe at this point and we can

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.590 
rows per pipe at this point and we can
kind<00:04:29.229> of<00:04:29.290> see<00:04:29.470> that<00:04:29.620> on<00:04:29.830> some<00:04:30.070> of<00:04:30.160> the<00:04:30.220> ones

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
kind of see that on some of the ones

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.570 
kind of see that on some of the ones
here<00:04:31.600> where<00:04:32.560> I<00:04:32.620> have<00:04:32.830> the<00:04:32.919> pipe<00:04:33.130> kind<00:04:33.430> of<00:04:33.490> in

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
here where I have the pipe kind of in

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.100 
here where I have the pipe kind of in
the<00:04:33.669> middle<00:04:33.880> of<00:04:33.970> two<00:04:34.150> rows<00:04:34.389> and<00:04:34.690> it's<00:04:34.810> bringing

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
the middle of two rows and it's bringing

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.080 
the middle of two rows and it's bringing
to<00:04:35.199> the<00:04:35.290> left<00:04:35.470> and<00:04:35.650> to<00:04:35.770> the<00:04:35.800> right<00:04:35.889> and<00:04:36.400> I<00:04:36.910> could

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
to the left and to the right and I could

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.469 
to the left and to the right and I could
basically<00:04:37.240> save<00:04:37.960> money<00:04:38.169> on<00:04:38.380> PVC<00:04:38.710> and<00:04:39.479> drill

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
basically save money on PVC and drill

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.600 
basically save money on PVC and drill
smaller<00:04:40.810> holes<00:04:41.229> which<00:04:41.860> allows<00:04:42.130> the<00:04:42.310> water<00:04:42.490> to

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
smaller holes which allows the water to

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.580 
smaller holes which allows the water to
go<00:04:42.820> further<00:04:43.120> these<00:04:43.870> spray<00:04:44.169> a<00:04:44.199> little<00:04:44.500> bit

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
go further these spray a little bit

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.620 
go further these spray a little bit
further<00:04:44.860> out<00:04:44.949> because<00:04:45.520> I<00:04:45.820> drilled<00:04:46.360> smaller

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
further out because I drilled smaller

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.689 
further out because I drilled smaller
holes<00:04:46.990> I<00:04:47.410> don't<00:04:47.740> want<00:04:47.860> to<00:04:47.949> at<00:04:48.100> the<00:04:48.220> end<00:04:48.370> I<00:04:48.550> had<00:04:48.669> a

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
holes I don't want to at the end I had a

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.120 
holes I don't want to at the end I had a
bigger<00:04:49.000> bit<00:04:49.300> and<00:04:49.960> when<00:04:50.050> it<00:04:50.169> broke<00:04:50.410> I<00:04:50.710> had<00:04:50.919> to<00:04:51.010> go

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
bigger bit and when it broke I had to go

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.180 
bigger bit and when it broke I had to go
buy<00:04:51.280> another<00:04:51.310> one<00:04:51.669> which<00:04:53.039> happened<00:04:54.039> several

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
buy another one which happened several

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.860 
buy another one which happened several
times<00:04:54.389> which<00:04:55.620> eventually<00:04:56.620> I<00:04:56.650> found<00:04:56.949> that<00:04:57.190> the

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
times which eventually I found that the

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.659 
times which eventually I found that the
1/16<00:04:58.870> inch<00:04:59.169> was<00:04:59.440> the<00:04:59.620> best<00:04:59.830> route<00:05:00.100> to<00:05:00.280> go<00:05:00.310> which

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
1/16 inch was the best route to go which

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.100 
1/16 inch was the best route to go which
I'll<00:05:00.820> show<00:05:01.030> you<00:05:01.530> here<00:05:02.530> on<00:05:02.650> this<00:05:02.770> last<00:05:03.010> bed

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
I'll show you here on this last bed

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.840 
I'll show you here on this last bed
which<00:05:05.110> is<00:05:05.289> all<00:05:05.530> 1/16<00:05:06.340> inch<00:05:06.550> holes<00:05:06.850> and<00:05:07.300> it

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
which is all 1/16 inch holes and it

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.110 
which is all 1/16 inch holes and it
really<00:05:09.850> sprays<00:05:10.450> a<00:05:10.750> far<00:05:11.349> distance<00:05:11.910> so<00:05:12.910> we<00:05:13.000> can

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
really sprays a far distance so we can

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.640 
really sprays a far distance so we can
see<00:05:13.240> with<00:05:13.389> this<00:05:13.510> one<00:05:13.570> this<00:05:13.810> is<00:05:13.870> the<00:05:14.080> last<00:05:14.110> bed

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
see with this one this is the last bed

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.440 
see with this one this is the last bed
that<00:05:14.800> I<00:05:14.830> did<00:05:15.130> I<00:05:15.430> kind<00:05:15.789> of<00:05:15.910> have<00:05:16.030> perfected

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
that I did I kind of have perfected

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.810 
that I did I kind of have perfected
things<00:05:16.780> the<00:05:17.229> most<00:05:17.470> and<00:05:17.860> it's<00:05:17.979> just<00:05:18.220> going<00:05:18.580> like

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
things the most and it's just going like

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.920 
things the most and it's just going like
crazy<00:05:19.440> to<00:05:20.440> where<00:05:20.620> it<00:05:20.830> sprays<00:05:21.419> literally<00:05:22.419> like

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
crazy to where it sprays literally like

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.050 
crazy to where it sprays literally like
overlapping<00:05:23.470> so<00:05:24.010> we're<00:05:24.190> doing<00:05:24.460> onions<00:05:24.910> in

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
overlapping so we're doing onions in

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.300 
overlapping so we're doing onions in
this<00:05:25.180> one<00:05:25.419> and<00:05:25.660> it's<00:05:25.780> just<00:05:25.870> real<00:05:26.200> happy<00:05:26.380> so

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
this one and it's just real happy so

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.480 
this one and it's just real happy so
I'll<00:05:28.320> show<00:05:29.320> you<00:05:29.349> now<00:05:29.590> if<00:05:29.770> I<00:05:29.889> turn<00:05:29.950> this<00:05:30.460> down<00:05:30.910> I

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
I'll show you now if I turn this down I

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.129 
I'll show you now if I turn this down I
have<00:05:33.490> variable<00:05:34.030> speed<00:05:34.060> where<00:05:34.630> I<00:05:34.660> can<00:05:34.990> our

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
have variable speed where I can our

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:37.589 
have variable speed where I can our
variable<00:05:35.470> pressure<00:05:35.710> or<00:05:36.610> I<00:05:36.639> can<00:05:36.940> take<00:05:37.120> this<00:05:37.300> all

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:37.599 
variable pressure or I can take this all

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:39.210 
variable pressure or I can take this all
the<00:05:37.630> way<00:05:37.720> down<00:05:37.840> or<00:05:38.410> I<00:05:38.440> can<00:05:38.740> crank<00:05:38.919> it<00:05:39.039> all<00:05:39.160> the

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
the way down or I can crank it all the

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.540 
the way down or I can crank it all the
way<00:05:39.310> back<00:05:39.550> up<00:05:39.580> again<00:05:40.919> so<00:05:41.919> that's<00:05:42.070> something

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
way back up again so that's something

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.300 
way back up again so that's something
great<00:05:42.970> to<00:05:43.180> have<00:05:43.389> because<00:05:43.810> you<00:05:43.840> might<00:05:44.310> isolate

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
great to have because you might isolate

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.850 
great to have because you might isolate
you<00:05:46.060> know<00:05:46.150> a<00:05:46.180> couple<00:05:46.449> different<00:05:46.870> spaces<00:05:47.440> or

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
you know a couple different spaces or

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.159 
you know a couple different spaces or
you<00:05:48.160> know<00:05:48.250> perhaps<00:05:48.520> get<00:05:48.940> the<00:05:49.180> water<00:05:49.780> to<00:05:49.960> fall

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169 
you know perhaps get the water to fall

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:51.570 
you know perhaps get the water to fall
exactly<00:05:50.470> where<00:05:50.800> you<00:05:50.919> want<00:05:51.130> it<00:05:51.250> if<00:05:51.370> you<00:05:51.400> have

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
exactly where you want it if you have

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.469 
exactly where you want it if you have
that<00:05:51.760> variable<00:05:52.120> pressure<00:05:52.389> so<00:05:53.199> that's<00:05:53.470> a<00:05:54.479> $2.15

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 
that variable pressure so that's a $2.15

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:58.379 
that variable pressure so that's a $2.15
or<00:05:55.750> so<00:05:55.960> a<00:05:56.320> great<00:05:57.280> investment<00:05:57.729> to<00:05:58.000> be<00:05:58.120> able<00:05:58.210> to

00:05:58.379 --> 00:05:58.389 
or so a great investment to be able to

00:05:58.389 --> 00:05:59.670 
or so a great investment to be able to
have<00:05:58.510> that<00:05:58.660> variable<00:05:59.020> pressure<00:05:59.289> and<00:05:59.590> of

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
have that variable pressure and of

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.879 
have that variable pressure and of
course<00:05:59.710> to<00:06:00.610> be<00:06:00.729> able<00:06:00.789> to<00:06:00.940> shut<00:06:01.150> the<00:06:01.240> bed's<00:06:01.419> off

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:01.889 
course to be able to shut the bed's off

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:04.140 
course to be able to shut the bed's off
down<00:06:02.889> here<00:06:03.070> at<00:06:03.160> the<00:06:03.250> tomatoes<00:06:03.729> I'm<00:06:03.940> doing

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
down here at the tomatoes I'm doing

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.200 
down here at the tomatoes I'm doing
things<00:06:04.330> a<00:06:04.630> little<00:06:05.139> bit<00:06:05.500> differently<00:06:06.010> I<00:06:06.310> custom

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
things a little bit differently I custom

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.100 
things a little bit differently I custom
drilled<00:06:08.199> this<00:06:08.860> PVC<00:06:09.550> to<00:06:09.849> where<00:06:10.060> it's<00:06:10.570> it's

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
drilled this PVC to where it's it's

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.930 
drilled this PVC to where it's it's
literally<00:06:11.590> soaking<00:06:11.919> the<00:06:12.430> bottom<00:06:12.789> of<00:06:12.849> the

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
literally soaking the bottom of the

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.230 
literally soaking the bottom of the
tomatoes<00:06:13.389> a<00:06:13.419> lot<00:06:13.780> a<00:06:13.990> lot<00:06:14.229> better<00:06:14.440> lot<00:06:15.240> more

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
tomatoes a lot a lot better lot more

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.180 
tomatoes a lot a lot better lot more
water<00:06:17.020> is<00:06:17.260> going<00:06:17.409> to<00:06:17.469> go<00:06:17.650> to<00:06:17.710> those

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.190 
water is going to go to those

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.260 
water is going to go to those
so<00:06:18.310> that's<00:06:19.030> a<00:06:19.210> nice<00:06:19.360> little<00:06:19.390> thing<00:06:19.870> we've<00:06:20.020> done

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
so that's a nice little thing we've done

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.690 
so that's a nice little thing we've done
the<00:06:22.270> last<00:06:22.540> thing<00:06:22.810> to<00:06:22.930> think<00:06:22.960> about<00:06:23.230> is<00:06:23.740> which<00:06:24.610> I

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:24.700 
the last thing to think about is which I

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.450 
the last thing to think about is which I
don't<00:06:24.760> have<00:06:25.030> implemented<00:06:25.420> yet<00:06:25.840> is<00:06:26.460> this

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460 
don't have implemented yet is this

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.470 
don't have implemented yet is this
specific<00:06:28.390> design<00:06:29.070> accounts<00:06:30.070> for<00:06:30.340> the<00:06:31.090> ability

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:31.480 
specific design accounts for the ability

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.830 
specific design accounts for the ability
to<00:06:31.600> do<00:06:31.750> four<00:06:32.620> seasons<00:06:33.190> gardening<00:06:34.120> to<00:06:34.690> where

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 
to do four seasons gardening to where

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.110 
to do four seasons gardening to where
each<00:06:35.050> of<00:06:35.230> the<00:06:35.320> water<00:06:35.560> pipes<00:06:35.920> sit<00:06:36.640> on<00:06:36.910> the

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 
each of the water pipes sit on the

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:42.410 
each of the water pipes sit on the
inside<00:06:37.630> of<00:06:37.930> the<00:06:38.020> raised<00:06:38.230> bed<00:06:38.400> so<00:06:39.400> that<00:06:39.670> the<00:06:40.770> the

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:42.420 
inside of the raised bed so that the the

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.180 
inside of the raised bed so that the the
the<00:06:43.420> plastic<00:06:44.020> is<00:06:44.200> going<00:06:44.680> to<00:06:44.770> be<00:06:44.860> able<00:06:44.980> to

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:45.190 
the plastic is going to be able to

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.260 
the plastic is going to be able to
literally<00:06:45.670> hinge<00:06:46.060> to<00:06:46.360> this<00:06:46.480> raised<00:06:46.750> bed<00:06:46.780> and

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:48.270 
literally hinge to this raised bed and

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.580 
literally hinge to this raised bed and
hopefully<00:06:49.270> I<00:06:49.300> mean<00:06:49.510> we<00:06:49.810> don't<00:06:50.140> see<00:06:50.260> how<00:06:50.380> things

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:50.590 
hopefully I mean we don't see how things

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:54.480 
hopefully I mean we don't see how things
work<00:06:51.000> the<00:06:52.000> if<00:06:52.570> the<00:06:52.930> water<00:06:53.200> would<00:06:53.470> work<00:06:53.710> in<00:06:54.010> the

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.490 
work the if the water would work in the

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.400 
work the if the water would work in the
winter<00:06:54.820> which<00:06:55.060> obviously<00:06:55.900> for<00:06:56.110> obvious

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:56.410 
winter which obviously for obvious

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:58.410 
winter which obviously for obvious
reasons<00:06:56.770> that<00:06:57.010> that<00:06:57.280> may<00:06:57.460> not<00:06:57.490> work<00:06:57.670> but<00:06:57.910> if<00:06:58.180> so

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:58.420 
reasons that that may not work but if so

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.790 
reasons that that may not work but if so
the<00:06:59.110> design<00:06:59.440> is<00:06:59.650> in<00:06:59.770> place<00:07:00.010> to<00:07:00.250> where<00:07:00.690> the<00:07:01.800> the

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 
the design is in place to where the the

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.230 
the design is in place to where the the
pipe<00:07:03.160> will<00:07:03.580> not<00:07:03.760> interfere<00:07:04.330> with<00:07:04.660> the

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 
pipe will not interfere with the

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.150 
pipe will not interfere with the
different<00:07:07.240> PVC<00:07:07.780> and<00:07:08.080> different<00:07:08.620> plastic<00:07:09.040> that

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:09.160 
different PVC and different plastic that

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.750 
different PVC and different plastic that
goes<00:07:09.220> over<00:07:09.550> the<00:07:09.670> top<00:07:09.700> so<00:07:10.300> all<00:07:10.540> in<00:07:11.260> all<00:07:11.320> I<00:07:11.380> think

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:11.760 
goes over the top so all in all I think

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.560 
goes over the top so all in all I think
this<00:07:12.760> shows<00:07:13.720> the<00:07:14.200> kind<00:07:14.590> of<00:07:14.710> the<00:07:14.800> best

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:15.570 
this shows the kind of the best

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:19.080 
this shows the kind of the best
practices<00:07:16.570> of<00:07:16.900> all<00:07:17.290> the<00:07:17.500> failed<00:07:17.800> attempts<00:07:18.310> so

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:19.090 
practices of all the failed attempts so

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:20.490 
practices of all the failed attempts so
what<00:07:19.240> you're<00:07:19.360> seeing<00:07:19.540> here<00:07:19.840> is<00:07:19.900> about<00:07:20.260> three

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:20.500 
what you're seeing here is about three

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.340 
what you're seeing here is about three
or<00:07:20.590> four<00:07:20.770> weeks<00:07:21.010> of<00:07:21.280> failed<00:07:21.610> attempts<00:07:22.150> and

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:22.350 
or four weeks of failed attempts and

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:24.750 
or four weeks of failed attempts and
different<00:07:23.350> variations<00:07:23.980> and<00:07:24.310> this<00:07:24.400> is<00:07:24.610> the

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:24.760 
different variations and this is the

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.030 
different variations and this is the
best<00:07:25.060> that's<00:07:25.419> come<00:07:25.720> out<00:07:25.750> of<00:07:25.900> all<00:07:26.440> of<00:07:26.740> those

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:27.040 
best that's come out of all of those

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.880 
best that's come out of all of those
different<00:07:27.580> experiments<00:07:28.300> and<00:07:29.230> so<00:07:29.530> really<00:07:29.740> the

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:29.890 
different experiments and so really the

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:31.920 
different experiments and so really the
only<00:07:29.919> place<00:07:30.190> you<00:07:30.460> need<00:07:30.610> glue<00:07:31.000> out<00:07:31.419> of<00:07:31.630> all<00:07:31.780> of

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:31.930 
only place you need glue out of all of

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.470 
only place you need glue out of all of
this<00:07:32.050> is<00:07:32.350> back<00:07:32.620> here<00:07:32.980> at<00:07:33.160> the<00:07:33.280> beginning<00:07:33.480> if

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:34.480 
this is back here at the beginning if

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.840 
this is back here at the beginning if
you<00:07:34.600> don't<00:07:34.780> have<00:07:34.900> glue<00:07:35.140> on<00:07:35.320> this<00:07:35.470> section

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:35.850 
you don't have glue on this section

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:37.950 
you don't have glue on this section
there's<00:07:36.850> so<00:07:37.000> much<00:07:37.120> pressure<00:07:37.330> that<00:07:37.660> this<00:07:37.780> will

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:37.960 
there's so much pressure that this will

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.230 
there's so much pressure that this will
push<00:07:38.169> off<00:07:38.410> so<00:07:38.919> everything<00:07:39.280> else<00:07:39.460> is<00:07:39.669> not<00:07:39.850> glued

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.240 
push off so everything else is not glued

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.600 
push off so everything else is not glued
so<00:07:41.110> again<00:07:41.380> it's<00:07:41.590> flexible<00:07:42.070> each<00:07:42.310> time<00:07:42.520> you

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:42.610 
so again it's flexible each time you

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:43.920 
so again it's flexible each time you
move<00:07:42.760> your<00:07:42.880> beds<00:07:43.090> around<00:07:43.270> you<00:07:43.690> have<00:07:43.840> the

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:43.930 
move your beds around you have the

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.200 
move your beds around you have the
capability<00:07:44.590> of<00:07:44.940> mixing<00:07:45.940> and<00:07:46.060> matching

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:46.210 
capability of mixing and matching

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:48.270 
capability of mixing and matching
different<00:07:46.419> pieces<00:07:46.990> together<00:07:47.169> and<00:07:47.740> you<00:07:48.130> don't

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:48.280 
different pieces together and you don't

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.120 
different pieces together and you don't
have<00:07:48.370> to<00:07:48.490> rebuy<00:07:48.820> or<00:07:49.210> repurchase<00:07:49.630> the<00:07:50.130> PVC

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:51.130 
have to rebuy or repurchase the PVC
