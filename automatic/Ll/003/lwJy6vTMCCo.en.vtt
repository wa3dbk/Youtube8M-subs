00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.369
 hello dear hungry day 2 of the pizza 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.410
 week and when we were with one yesterday 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:18.689
 However, although very beautiful and he 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.880
 lengthy make pizza in focus 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.490
 it's more of a flash today 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.060
 variant because there is the pizza from the 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.920
 pan 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:32.489
 we need some milk salt for that 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.600
 butter and flour and that can be wheat and 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.080
 also think to be more 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.699
 I use it here half each 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.489
 First we go to a sieve the flour 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:44.460
 and the salt and seven in one 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.680
 bowl we go now the 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.140
 Pieced butter must have this first 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.699
 with a fork something underneath and 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.219
 then knead with your hands in dough 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:56.430
 So far, it has a consistency 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.379
 So on bread crumbs called then we go 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.980
 the plant wanted and the milk too 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.940
 we mix everything with our hands 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.030
 is represented until we have a relative 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.490
 have firm dough and shape it then 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.800
 a ball 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.540
 now we want the dough around out and 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.140
 though so that he size the pans 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.150
 corresponds to 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.520
 with me it is a diameter of 23 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.380
 centimeters 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.840
 we now stroke the said pan 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.229
 some oil then place the slices of dough 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.290
 and straighten or correct the 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.240
 We 'll give you something else 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.460
 now in strong heat on one 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.890
 cook plate and fry the bottom 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.079
 our pizza soil in about five to 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.509
 seven minutes golden brown or light 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.310
 brownish in the meantime we dedicate ourselves 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.689
 us of the coating and actually you have 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.460
 the free hand because I'm doing 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.909
 mainly around the pizza delivery man from the 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.880
 pan 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.700
 but I decided for 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.939
 tomato marrow ham tomato slices 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.500
 grated mozzarella and oregano and 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:58.290
 Now there are two options either 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.930
 You spread the top of the pizza 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.329
 Wells with oil topped him and grilled 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.000
 then the top in the oven need 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.250
 the microwave or variant 2 of the 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.959
 pizza bottom is turned and occupied 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.579
 However, that must be a bit quick 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.040
 so that the heat of the 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:14.620
 current top used effectively 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.019
 can be 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.299
 So I deny with tomatenmark give 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.700
 from the rieder only on it distribute the 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:24.340
 complete halved cook ham slices 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.080
 concluding with the tomato and caretaker 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.629
 everything with the given mozzarella 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.370
 while the bottoms are tanning the 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.530
 covering hot and to be safe 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.879
 that the cheese also tapers it recommends 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.329
 get a lid on the pan 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.760
 give 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:38.590
 I decorate the ready-baked pizza 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.480
 still with some small plates of basil 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.760
 yes and then we can be eaten 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.879
 could see this pizza is quick 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.680
 I also prepare and taste it 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.780
 I wish you much fun in the 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.319
 preparation and a pretty good one 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.329
 appetite and if so again order 1 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.310
 the pizza week or ever in the 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.620
 Channels of multi cook american 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.510
 cook or barefoot then wants to look 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.579
 Do you have the opportunity to stay here? 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.569
 to say until the next time 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.569
 bye Bye
