all<00:00:05.290> right

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:05.740 
all right

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.409 
all right
tree<00:00:06.040> planting<00:00:06.220> rings<00:00:06.790> let's<00:00:07.089> talk<00:00:07.270> about

00:00:07.409 --> 00:00:07.419 
tree planting rings let's talk about

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:10.920 
tree planting rings let's talk about
tree<00:00:07.810> planting<00:00:07.839> rings<00:00:09.000> we'll<00:00:10.000> call<00:00:10.330> this<00:00:10.600> the

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:10.930 
tree planting rings we'll call this the

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.459 
tree planting rings we'll call this the
grade<00:00:11.199> a<00:00:11.650> tree<00:00:12.580> planting<00:00:13.090> ring<00:00:13.330> the<00:00:13.719> theory<00:00:14.170> is

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:14.469 
grade a tree planting ring the theory is

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.659 
grade a tree planting ring the theory is
that<00:00:14.860> if<00:00:15.400> you<00:00:15.609> put<00:00:15.910> a<00:00:16.150> plastic<00:00:17.080> ring<00:00:17.590> in<00:00:18.430> the

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:18.669 
that if you put a plastic ring in the

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:22.320 
that if you put a plastic ring in the
ground<00:00:19.710> that's<00:00:20.710> a<00:00:20.859> containment<00:00:21.310> and<00:00:21.730> plant

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330 
ground that's a containment and plant

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.529 
ground that's a containment and plant
your<00:00:22.509> tree<00:00:22.779> in<00:00:22.990> here<00:00:23.380> that<00:00:24.130> the<00:00:24.339> roots<00:00:24.669> of<00:00:25.029> this

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:25.539 
your tree in here that the roots of this

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.429 
your tree in here that the roots of this
tree<00:00:25.599> as<00:00:26.109> they<00:00:26.320> develop<00:00:26.800> will<00:00:27.579> grow<00:00:27.820> down<00:00:28.439> and

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439 
tree as they develop will grow down and

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.750 
tree as they develop will grow down and
out<00:00:30.099> and<00:00:31.169> you'll<00:00:32.169> end<00:00:32.380> up<00:00:32.500> with<00:00:32.650> a<00:00:32.710> tree<00:00:33.070> that

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
out and you'll end up with a tree that

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.550 
out and you'll end up with a tree that
doesn't<00:00:34.060> buckle<00:00:34.600> the<00:00:34.690> sidewalk<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:36.430> truth

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:37.560 
doesn't buckle the sidewalk the truth

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.670 
doesn't buckle the sidewalk the truth
when<00:00:38.560> you<00:00:38.590> put<00:00:38.890> a<00:00:38.920> tree<00:00:39.220> in<00:00:39.340> a<00:00:39.430> planting<00:00:39.880> ring

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
when you put a tree in a planting ring

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.020 
when you put a tree in a planting ring
what<00:00:41.680> really<00:00:42.070> happens<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:44.200> the<00:00:44.920> roots<00:00:45.190> erupt

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
what really happens is the roots erupt

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.920 
what really happens is the roots erupt
and<00:00:46.240> go<00:00:46.510> over<00:00:47.020> the<00:00:47.740> top<00:00:47.980> of<00:00:48.160> the<00:00:48.250> planting<00:00:48.700> ring

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
and go over the top of the planting ring

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.470 
and go over the top of the planting ring
the<00:00:49.930> ones<00:00:50.140> that<00:00:50.350> go<00:00:50.500> deeper<00:00:51.480> frequently

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
the ones that go deeper frequently

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.500 
the ones that go deeper frequently
circle<00:00:53.170> and<00:00:53.410> girdle<00:00:53.890> the<00:00:53.920> tree<00:00:54.360> creating<00:00:55.360> a

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
circle and girdle the tree creating a

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.650 
circle and girdle the tree creating a
long-term<00:00:56.140> instability<00:00:56.650> or<00:00:57.280> a<00:00:57.910> tree<00:00:58.480> that

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
long-term instability or a tree that

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.920 
long-term instability or a tree that
cuts<00:00:58.960> off<00:00:59.170> its<00:00:59.470> own<00:00:59.760> growth<00:01:00.760> by<00:01:01.360> girdling<00:01:01.870> the

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
cuts off its own growth by girdling the

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.649 
cuts off its own growth by girdling the
roots<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:04.629> I<00:01:04.900> think<00:01:05.590> this<00:01:05.950> is<00:01:06.130> a<00:01:06.659> procedure

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
roots so I think this is a procedure

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.609 
roots so I think this is a procedure
that<00:01:07.810> is<00:01:08.109> being<00:01:08.289> sold<00:01:08.740> as<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:10.060> solution<00:01:10.810> that<00:01:11.560> is

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
that is being sold as a solution that is

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.179 
that is being sold as a solution that is
not<00:01:12.399> doing<00:01:12.759> our<00:01:12.909> trees<00:01:13.179> any<00:01:13.509> favors<00:01:14.170> and<00:01:14.469> in

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 
not doing our trees any favors and in

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:17.819 
not doing our trees any favors and in
the<00:01:15.280> long<00:01:15.460> run<00:01:15.490> is<00:01:15.969> causing<00:01:16.479> much<00:01:16.929> more<00:01:17.259> damage

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829 
the long run is causing much more damage

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:21.149 
the long run is causing much more damage
and<00:01:18.039> harm<00:01:18.579> than<00:01:19.210> good<00:01:19.240> and<00:01:19.799> I'm<00:01:20.799> gonna<00:01:20.950> prove

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
and harm than good and I'm gonna prove

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:21.529 
and harm than good and I'm gonna prove
it

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539 
it

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.289 
it
all<00:01:22.539> right<00:01:22.719> threesomes<00:01:23.499> don't<00:01:23.859> work<00:01:24.299> there

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
all right threesomes don't work there

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.469 
all right threesomes don't work there
we've<00:01:25.450> got<00:01:25.659> this<00:01:26.460> cotton<00:01:27.460> Assessor<00:01:27.939> folia

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
we've got this cotton Assessor folia

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.169 
we've got this cotton Assessor folia
London<00:01:29.109> plane<00:01:29.439> that<00:01:30.219> was<00:01:30.340> planted<00:01:30.789> in<00:01:30.939> this

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
London plane that was planted in this

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:35.370 
London plane that was planted in this
surround<00:01:31.960> that's<00:01:32.319> about<00:01:32.729> no<00:01:33.840> presumably<00:01:34.840> 24

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
surround that's about no presumably 24

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.389 
surround that's about no presumably 24
inches<00:01:35.649> around<00:01:35.829> and<00:01:36.670> anyone<00:01:37.479> who<00:01:37.659> knows<00:01:37.840> trees

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
inches around and anyone who knows trees

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.559 
inches around and anyone who knows trees
recognizes<00:01:39.399> that<00:01:39.520> this<00:01:39.670> variety<00:01:40.240> of<00:01:40.270> tree

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:40.569 
recognizes that this variety of tree

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:43.050 
recognizes that this variety of tree
will<00:01:40.780> reach<00:01:40.960> 24<00:01:41.530> inches<00:01:41.770> in<00:01:41.829> diameter<00:01:42.100> and<00:01:42.579> a

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
will reach 24 inches in diameter and a

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.730 
will reach 24 inches in diameter and a
hoe<00:01:43.840> about<00:01:44.170> 15<00:01:45.069> to<00:01:45.429> 18<00:01:45.459> years<00:01:46.149> so<00:01:46.990> I'm<00:01:47.380> guessing

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
hoe about 15 to 18 years so I'm guessing

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.709 
hoe about 15 to 18 years so I'm guessing
that<00:01:47.889> this<00:01:48.009> tree<00:01:48.249> has<00:01:48.340> been<00:01:48.369> here<00:01:48.520> about<00:01:48.939> 10

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:49.719 
that this tree has been here about 10

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:52.319 
that this tree has been here about 10
years<00:01:49.749> now<00:01:50.229> 8<00:01:50.560> to<00:01:50.590> 10<00:01:50.889> years<00:01:51.130> and<00:01:51.969> over<00:01:52.149> on<00:01:52.240> the

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
years now 8 to 10 years and over on the

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:53.699 
years now 8 to 10 years and over on the
left<00:01:52.539> here<00:01:52.749> you<00:01:52.780> can<00:01:52.990> see<00:01:53.139> that<00:01:53.319> the<00:01:53.499> roots

00:01:53.699 --> 00:01:53.709 
left here you can see that the roots

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:56.940 
left here you can see that the roots
have<00:01:54.490> completely<00:01:55.389> ignored<00:01:55.869> the<00:01:56.439> rules<00:01:56.770> that

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
have completely ignored the rules that

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.739 
have completely ignored the rules that
we<00:01:57.219> have<00:01:57.249> imposed<00:01:57.639> upon<00:01:57.880> this<00:01:58.179> tree<00:01:58.420> to<00:01:58.539> keep

00:01:58.739 --> 00:01:58.749 
we have imposed upon this tree to keep

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:02.249 
we have imposed upon this tree to keep
the<00:01:59.079> system<00:01:59.619> of<00:01:59.770> roots<00:02:00.009> going<00:02:00.279> down<00:02:00.579> low<00:02:00.899> so<00:02:01.899> in

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
the system of roots going down low so in

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.590 
the system of roots going down low so in
no<00:02:02.499> time<00:02:02.709> it's<00:02:02.950> going<00:02:03.100> to<00:02:03.159> break<00:02:03.340> this<00:02:03.579> and

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
no time it's going to break this and

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.230 
no time it's going to break this and
my<00:02:05.170> my<00:02:06.040> thoughts<00:02:06.310> are<00:02:06.550> that<00:02:07.200> these<00:02:08.200> surrounds

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
my my thoughts are that these surrounds

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.330 
my my thoughts are that these surrounds
really<00:02:10.240> don't<00:02:10.810> slow<00:02:11.380> things<00:02:11.710> down<00:02:11.800> they<00:02:12.190> don't

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
really don't slow things down they don't

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.000 
really don't slow things down they don't
help<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:13.330> in<00:02:13.840> many<00:02:14.020> cases<00:02:14.290> create<00:02:14.980> a

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
help and in many cases create a

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.960 
help and in many cases create a
situation<00:02:15.370> where<00:02:15.820> where<00:02:16.810> they<00:02:17.050> do<00:02:17.970> deflect

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
situation where where they do deflect

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.570 
situation where where they do deflect
the<00:02:19.090> roots<00:02:19.330> they<00:02:20.110> sometimes<00:02:20.500> cause<00:02:21.100> root

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
the roots they sometimes cause root

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.630 
the roots they sometimes cause root
girdling<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:22.450> that<00:02:22.630> can<00:02:22.900> be<00:02:23.130> as<00:02:24.130> much<00:02:24.370> of<00:02:24.430> a

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
girdling and that can be as much of a

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.480 
girdling and that can be as much of a
problem<00:02:24.850> so<00:02:25.330> in<00:02:26.320> my<00:02:26.470> opinion<00:02:29.250> these<00:02:30.250> roots

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
problem so in my opinion these roots

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.240 
problem so in my opinion these roots
arounds<00:02:30.970> are<00:02:31.120> not<00:02:32.050> only<00:02:32.320> a<00:02:32.350> waste<00:02:32.620> of<00:02:32.800> time<00:02:33.040> and

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
arounds are not only a waste of time and

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.930 
arounds are not only a waste of time and
a<00:02:33.310> waste<00:02:33.340> of<00:02:33.700> money<00:02:34.050> but<00:02:35.250> they<00:02:36.250> don't<00:02:36.280> work<00:02:36.640> and

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
a waste of money but they don't work and

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.790 
a waste of money but they don't work and
sometimes<00:02:37.300> they<00:02:37.570> cause<00:02:37.840> more<00:02:38.110> harm<00:02:38.320> than<00:02:38.530> good

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
sometimes they cause more harm than good

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.010 
sometimes they cause more harm than good
you<00:02:39.700> see<00:02:39.850> the<00:02:39.970> thing<00:02:40.180> is<00:02:40.390> that<00:02:40.630> there<00:02:40.870> are

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
you see the thing is that there are

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.250 
you see the thing is that there are
species<00:02:41.380> of<00:02:41.770> trees<00:02:42.100> that<00:02:42.630> are<00:02:43.630> useful<00:02:44.020> for

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
species of trees that are useful for

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.040 
species of trees that are useful for
planting<00:02:45.010> along<00:02:45.489> roadsides<00:02:46.150> because<00:02:46.900> it's

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
planting along roadsides because it's

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.220 
planting along roadsides because it's
recognized<00:02:47.650> that<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:48.040> roots<00:02:48.420> generally<00:02:49.420> will

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
recognized that the roots generally will

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.400 
recognized that the roots generally will
grow<00:02:50.470> fairly<00:02:51.040> deep<00:02:51.900> but<00:02:52.900> when<00:02:53.050> you<00:02:53.140> have<00:02:53.290> an

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
grow fairly deep but when you have an

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.020 
grow fairly deep but when you have an
environment<00:02:53.890> where<00:02:54.070> the<00:02:54.160> soil<00:02:54.400> gets<00:02:54.640> scraped

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
environment where the soil gets scraped

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.060 
environment where the soil gets scraped
or<00:02:55.540> it's<00:02:55.750> really<00:02:55.900> bad<00:02:56.200> soil<00:02:56.590> or<00:02:56.830> there's<00:02:57.010> a

or it's really bad soil or there's a

aggressive very large growing species is

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.970 
aggressive very large growing species is
not<00:03:05.709> going<00:03:06.130> to<00:03:06.480> benefit<00:03:07.480> at<00:03:07.630> all<00:03:07.750> from<00:03:08.170> a<00:03:08.470> roots

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
not going to benefit at all from a roots

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.640 
not going to benefit at all from a roots
around<00:03:09.720> here's<00:03:10.720> one<00:03:10.930> that<00:03:11.049> you<00:03:11.110> can<00:03:11.290> say<00:03:11.440> well

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
around here's one that you can say well

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.979 
around here's one that you can say well
this<00:03:11.860> one<00:03:12.010> looks<00:03:12.040> like<00:03:12.280> it's<00:03:12.519> working<00:03:12.989> well

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
this one looks like it's working well

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.280 
this one looks like it's working well
it's<00:03:14.110> a<00:03:14.320> fairly<00:03:14.950> young<00:03:15.160> tree<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:15.610> it's<00:03:16.290> it's

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
it's a fairly young tree and it's it's

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.960 
it's a fairly young tree and it's it's
definitely<00:03:17.799> a<00:03:17.830> piece<00:03:18.010> of<00:03:18.160> plastic<00:03:18.519> around<00:03:18.850> the

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
definitely a piece of plastic around the

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.479 
definitely a piece of plastic around the
trunk<00:03:19.180> of<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.480> tree<00:03:19.799> but<00:03:20.799> judging<00:03:21.340> by

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
trunk of the tree but judging by

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.300 
trunk of the tree but judging by
everything<00:03:22.030> else<00:03:22.299> we<00:03:22.570> look<00:03:22.750> for<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:22.989> back<00:03:23.310> can

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
everything else we look for the back can

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.910 
everything else we look for the back can
you<00:03:24.340> say<00:03:24.640> it's<00:03:24.790> doing<00:03:25.150> anything<00:03:25.540> positive

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
you say it's doing anything positive

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.839 
you say it's doing anything positive
I<00:03:28.599> can't<00:03:29.599> say<00:03:29.750> that<00:03:29.930> it<00:03:30.050> is<00:03:30.260> in<00:03:31.220> time<00:03:31.550> that's

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:31.849 
I can't say that it is in time that's

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:33.729 
I can't say that it is in time that's
gonna<00:03:32.030> just<00:03:32.510> get<00:03:32.660> envelop<00:03:33.020> tin<00:03:33.290> to<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:33.470> trunk

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
gonna just get envelop tin to the trunk

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.990 
gonna just get envelop tin to the trunk
and<00:03:35.800> once<00:03:36.800> again<00:03:36.920> I<00:03:37.040> just<00:03:37.340> think<00:03:37.550> it's<00:03:37.760> a<00:03:37.819> waste

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
and once again I just think it's a waste

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.180 
and once again I just think it's a waste
of<00:03:38.120> money<00:03:40.239> there's<00:03:41.239> another<00:03:41.450> one<00:03:42.190> it's

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
of money there's another one it's

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.070 
of money there's another one it's
escaping

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.800 

now<00:03:47.470> here's<00:03:47.740> a<00:03:47.850> root<00:03:48.850> containment<00:03:49.510> that<00:03:49.660> has

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
now here's a root containment that has

been completely ignored by this tree now
in<00:03:54.160> my<00:03:54.310> opinion<00:03:54.760> a<00:03:54.850> more<00:03:55.030> valuable<00:03:55.630> approach

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
in my opinion a more valuable approach

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.260 
in my opinion a more valuable approach
would<00:03:57.190> be<00:03:57.220> to<00:03:58.410> prepare<00:03:59.410> a<00:03:59.470> planting<00:04:00.040> hole<00:04:00.280> that

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
would be to prepare a planting hole that

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.580 
would be to prepare a planting hole that
is<00:04:01.740> conducive<00:04:02.740> to<00:04:03.040> deeper<00:04:03.730> root<00:04:03.940> development

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
is conducive to deeper root development

is conducive to deeper root development
if<00:04:05.590> these<00:04:05.890> trees<00:04:06.160> get<00:04:06.430> put<00:04:06.640> in<00:04:06.760> a<00:04:06.850> very<00:04:07.060> small
