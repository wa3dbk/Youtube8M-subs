and i wouldn't see the sense of

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.749 
and i wouldn't see the sense of
something<00:01:36.720> like<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.140> but<00:01:37.650> then<00:01:37.860> what<00:01:38.549> they

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
something like that but then what they

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.450 
something like that but then what they
