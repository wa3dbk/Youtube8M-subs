uh hey my first pumpkin and pretty happy
with<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:19.400> on<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.579> vegetation<00:00:20.999> starting<00:00:21.539> to

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:21.599 
with it on the vegetation starting to

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:24.409 
with it on the vegetation starting to
die<00:00:21.749> off<00:00:21.929> from<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.320> as<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.820> can<00:00:23.999> see<00:00:24.150> but<00:00:24.359> a

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:24.419 
die off from it as you can see but a

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:26.689 
die off from it as you can see but a
plant<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.560> end<00:00:25.769> up<00:00:25.919> growing<00:00:26.099> pretty<00:00:26.369> big<00:00:26.489> that

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
plant and end up growing pretty big that

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.880 
plant and end up growing pretty big that
step<00:00:27.169> something<00:00:28.169> that's<00:00:28.439> grown<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:28.649> soil

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
step something that's grown in soil

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.399 
step something that's grown in soil
won't<00:00:29.339> take<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.489> closer<00:00:29.699> look<00:00:29.849> at<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.089> one<00:00:30.409> as

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:31.409 
won't take a closer look at that one as

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:33.490 
won't take a closer look at that one as
a<00:00:31.470> reservoir<00:00:32.040> over<00:00:32.070> there<00:00:32.399> swinging<00:00:33.000> around

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
a reservoir over there swinging around

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.170 
a reservoir over there swinging around
this<00:00:34.500> pumpkin<00:00:35.039> actually<00:00:35.340> took<00:00:35.550> off<00:00:35.699> and<00:00:36.000> about

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
this pumpkin actually took off and about

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.029 
this pumpkin actually took off and about
it's<00:00:37.019> only<00:00:37.140> about<00:00:37.289> a<00:00:37.379> month<00:00:37.500> old<00:00:37.649> housing

00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:38.039 
it's only about a month old housing

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:41.479 
it's only about a month old housing
start<00:00:38.280> turning<00:00:38.519> orange<00:00:38.760> yet<00:00:39.710> yeah<00:00:40.710> if<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.160> I

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
start turning orange yet yeah if you I

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.650 
start turning orange yet yeah if you I
don't<00:00:41.789> know<00:00:41.910> if<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.059> can<00:00:42.179> see<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.390> but<00:00:42.600> the

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
don't know if you can see that but the

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.069 
don't know if you can see that but the
base<00:00:42.929> is<00:00:42.960> actually<00:00:43.469> starting<00:00:43.769> to<00:00:43.940> tear<00:00:44.940> away

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
base is actually starting to tear away

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.479 
base is actually starting to tear away
tear<00:00:46.079> away<00:00:46.140> from<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.469> pumpkin<00:00:46.739> but<00:00:46.949> so<00:00:47.219> I'm<00:00:47.339> go

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
ahead and I cut this and give to the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.779 
ahead and I cut this and give to the
kids<00:00:50.760> for<00:00:50.940> Halloween<00:00:52.160> well<00:00:53.160> my<00:00:53.429> wife<00:00:53.609> just

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.229 
bathroom scale out here to way way this
guy<00:00:58.440> but<00:00:58.710> by<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.100> guess<00:00:59.370> probably<00:00:59.730> right

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
guy but by the guess probably right

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.850 
guy but by the guess probably right
around<00:01:00.329> 35<00:01:00.960> pounds<00:01:01.879> not<00:01:02.879> bad<00:01:03.530> so<00:01:04.530> we're<00:01:04.739> going

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
around 35 pounds not bad so we're going

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.860 
around 35 pounds not bad so we're going
head<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.330> grab<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.420> one<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.690> grew<00:01:06.900> in<00:01:06.960> soil

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:08.870 
head and grab the one that grew in soil

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.180 
head and grab the one that grew in soil
this<00:01:09.870> is<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.080> pumpkin<00:01:10.410> that<00:01:10.440> green<00:01:10.740> soil<00:01:11.130> I

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
this is the pumpkin that green soil I

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.180 
this is the pumpkin that green soil I
wasn't<00:01:11.520> trying<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.030> comparison<00:01:12.720> but<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:13.160> was<00:01:14.160> a

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
wasn't trying to comparison but I was a

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.090 
wasn't trying to comparison but I was a
has<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.240> extra<00:01:15.540> plant<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.020> just<00:01:16.320> went<00:01:17.040> ahead

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
has the extra plant so I just went ahead

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.410 
has the extra plant so I just went ahead
and<00:01:17.280> made<00:01:17.370> a<00:01:17.430> little<00:01:17.750> little<00:01:18.750> bed<00:01:18.930> port<00:01:19.230> but

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
and made a little little bed port but

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.000 
and made a little little bed port but
see<00:01:21.420> much<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.050> advantage<00:01:22.560> with<00:01:22.710> hydroponics

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
see much of advantage with hydroponics

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.320 
see much of advantage with hydroponics
here<00:01:23.460> seem<00:01:24.360> like<00:01:24.480> the<00:01:24.570> soil<00:01:25.640> outperformed<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
here seem like the soil outperformed the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.000 
here seem like the soil outperformed the
hydro<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:29.670> hydroponic<00:01:30.560> poop<00:01:31.560> can<00:01:31.710> actually

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
hydro the hydroponic poop can actually

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.000 
hydro the hydroponic poop can actually
took<00:01:32.160> off<00:01:32.370> a<00:01:32.400> lot<00:01:32.700> faster<00:01:32.730> than<00:01:33.680> this<00:01:34.680> one<00:01:34.740> has

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 
took off a lot faster than this one has

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.370 
took off a lot faster than this one has
grown<00:01:35.160> soil<00:01:35.580> but<00:01:35.730> this<00:01:35.850> one<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.380> steadily

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
grown soil but this one a steadily

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.980 
grown soil but this one a steadily
caught<00:01:37.740> up<00:01:38.060> and<00:01:39.060> actually<00:01:39.360> what<00:01:39.480> this<00:01:39.600> pumpkin

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
caught up and actually what this pumpkin

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.190 
caught up and actually what this pumpkin
actually<00:01:40.320> passed<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.890> passed<00:01:41.610> hydroponic<00:01:42.210> one

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
actually passed a passed hydroponic one

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.020 
actually passed a passed hydroponic one
well<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:44.860> one<00:01:45.040> on<00:01:45.250> the<00:01:45.310> left<00:01:45.490> is<00:01:45.700> one<00:01:45.880> that

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
well the one on the left is one that

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.780 
well the one on the left is one that
grew<00:01:46.150> in<00:01:46.210> soil<00:01:46.600> actually<00:01:47.020> it<00:01:47.259> was<00:01:47.350> just<00:01:47.380> a

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
grew in soil actually it was just a

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.929 
grew in soil actually it was just a
compost<00:01:48.790> obscure<00:01:49.180> maneuver<00:01:49.710> but<00:01:50.710> this<00:01:50.860> boy<00:01:51.759> is

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
compost obscure maneuver but this boy is

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:53.999 
compost obscure maneuver but this boy is
probably<00:01:52.240> a<00:01:52.360> 10<00:01:53.320> pounds<00:01:53.649> heavier<00:01:53.710> than

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
probably a 10 pounds heavier than

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.580 
probably a 10 pounds heavier than
hydroponic<00:01:54.670> one<00:01:54.820> and<00:01:54.970> the<00:01:55.840> skin<00:01:56.200> looks<00:01:56.229> like

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
hydroponic one and the skin looks like

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.160 
hydroponic one and the skin looks like
nice<00:01:56.799> and<00:01:56.979> smooth<00:01:57.220> looks<00:01:57.549> like<00:01:57.700> a<00:01:58.170> pumpkin

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
nice and smooth looks like a pumpkin

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.100 
nice and smooth looks like a pumpkin
that<00:01:59.350> you'd<00:01:59.500> want<00:01:59.710> buy<00:01:59.860> at<00:02:00.009> a<00:02:00.040> store<00:02:01.110> Hydra

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
that you'd want buy at a store Hydra

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.380 
that you'd want buy at a store Hydra
pumpkin<00:02:02.530> one<00:02:02.710> pretty<00:02:03.460> dry

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.650 

definitely<00:02:07.390> not<00:02:08.700> as<00:02:09.700> good-looking<00:02:10.060> as<00:02:10.420> the

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
definitely not as good-looking as the

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.009 
definitely not as good-looking as the
two<00:02:11.080> one<00:02:11.230> growing<00:02:11.440> in<00:02:11.590> a<00:02:11.730> compost<00:02:12.959> or<00:02:13.959> soil
