them to pop out screws do not come out
of<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.140> cover<00:00:52.500> because<00:00:53.460> if<00:00:53.699> they<00:00:53.910> do<00:00:54.800> then

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
of the cover because if they do then

of the cover because if they do then
your<00:00:55.949> cover<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.399> broken

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.170

yeah then we will remove the screw from
the<00:01:03.300> side<00:01:03.989> brush<00:01:04.610> be<00:01:05.610> careful<00:01:06.090> with<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.420> not<00:01:06.570> to

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
the side brush be careful with it not to

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.590 
the side brush be careful with it not to
lose<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.170> because<00:01:07.850> it's<00:01:08.850> very<00:01:08.909> hard<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.360> find<00:01:09.540> a

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
lose it because it's very hard to find a

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.310 
lose it because it's very hard to find a
replacement<00:01:09.750> for<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.470> screws<00:01:11.330> then<00:01:12.330> what<00:01:13.170> we

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
replacement for the screws then what we

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.060 
replacement for the screws then what we
do<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.650> we<00:01:14.220> just<00:01:14.430> flip<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.970> cover<00:01:15.210> up<00:01:15.920> we<00:01:16.920> get

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
do is we just flip the cover up we get

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.800 
do is we just flip the cover up we get
the<00:01:17.250> battery<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.090> located<00:01:18.450> right<00:01:18.750> here

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
the battery that is located right here

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.620 
the battery that is located right here
pull<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.560> by<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.860> strap<00:01:20.310> take<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.240> off

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
pull it by the strap take it off

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.039 
pull it by the strap take it off
get<00:01:21.869> another<00:01:22.140> one<00:01:23.090> get<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.270> new<00:01:24.390> one<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.930> I

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
get another one get the new one and I

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.940 
get another one get the new one and I
just<00:01:25.259> seen<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.470> other<00:01:25.680> one<00:01:26.479> put<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:27.950> you

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
just seen the other one put it in you

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.289 
just seen the other one put it in you
could<00:01:29.130> see<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.610> goes<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:29.939> this<00:01:30.090> way

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
could see that it goes in this way

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.830 
could see that it goes in this way
because<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.840> has<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.290> wall<00:01:31.790> the<00:01:32.790> wall<00:01:33.030> bump

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
because it has the wall the wall bump

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.810 
because it has the wall the wall bump
right<00:01:34.079> there<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.680> goes<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.400> pretty<00:01:35.640> well

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
right there and it goes in pretty well

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.889 
right there and it goes in pretty well
over<00:01:36.180> there<00:01:38.509> it's<00:01:39.509> wool<00:01:40.220> in<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.280> car<00:01:41.549> with<00:01:41.670> us

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
over there it's wool in the car with us

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.770 
over there it's wool in the car with us
make<00:01:42.899> sure<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.110> it's<00:01:43.439> aligned<00:01:43.740> pretty<00:01:44.369> good

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
make sure that it's aligned pretty good

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.230 
make sure that it's aligned pretty good
snaps<00:01:45.780> into<00:01:46.079> place<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.850> then<00:01:47.850> we<00:01:48.030> just

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
snaps into place and then we just

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.080 
snaps into place and then we just
screwed<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.570> screws<00:01:48.990> back<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:52.640> when<00:01:53.640> we<00:01:53.820> screw

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
screwed the screws back in when we screw

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
screwed the screws back in when we screw
them<00:01:54.270> in<00:01:54.619> you<00:01:55.619> could<00:01:55.829> do<00:01:55.979> them<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.399> order<00:01:56.780> but<00:01:57.780> I

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
them in you could do them in order but I

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.929 
them in you could do them in order but I
prefer<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.310> do<00:01:59.460> them<00:01:59.670> in<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.360> X<00:02:00.810> style<00:02:01.939> because

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
prefer to do them in a X style because

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.170 
prefer to do them in a X style because
that<00:02:03.329> kind<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.600> makes<00:02:04.189> sure<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.490> screws

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
that kind of makes sure that the screws

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:15.550 
that kind of makes sure that the screws
are<00:02:06.360> in<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:08.220> plate<00:02:08.489> goes<00:02:08.700> in<00:02:09.349> evenly

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.800 

when<00:02:16.560> you're<00:02:16.709> doing<00:02:17.010> this<00:02:17.239> you<00:02:18.239> could<00:02:18.420> open

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
when you're doing this you could open

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.759 
when you're doing this you could open
the<00:02:19.260> cover<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.780> get<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.810> vacuum<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.379> suck<00:02:22.620> out

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
the cover and get a vacuum and suck out

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.339 
the cover and get a vacuum and suck out
all<00:02:22.799> the<00:02:23.220> extra<00:02:23.640> dust<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.360> hair<00:02:24.720> that<00:02:24.780> clots

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
all the extra dust and hair that clots

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.080 
all the extra dust and hair that clots
in<00:02:25.680> there<00:02:25.890> gets<00:02:26.879> naked<00:02:27.090> I<00:02:28.280> can<00:02:29.280> minimize<00:02:29.579> the

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
in there gets naked I can minimize the

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.000 
in there gets naked I can minimize the
life<00:02:30.299> of<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.870> Roomba<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:34.260> side<00:02:34.500> brush<00:02:34.739> in

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
life of the Roomba the side brush in

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.699 
life of the Roomba the side brush in
make<00:02:35.430> sure<00:02:35.579> it's<00:02:35.730> popped<00:02:36.000> into<00:02:36.209> place<00:02:36.650> put<00:02:37.650> the

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
make sure it's popped into place put the

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:45.650 
make sure it's popped into place put the
screw<00:02:38.099> inside<00:02:43.609> be<00:02:44.609> tricky<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.180> screw<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:45.540> in

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
screw inside be tricky to screw it in

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:52.430 
screw inside be tricky to screw it in
sometimes<00:02:50.150> screw<00:02:51.150> again<00:02:51.269> but<00:02:51.840> we<00:02:51.959> don't<00:02:52.170> over

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
sometimes screw again but we don't over

it<00:03:20.160> may<00:03:20.370> ruin<00:03:20.579> the<00:03:20.880> battery<00:03:21.150> life<00:03:21.569> it<00:03:22.440> will

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
it may ruin the battery life it will

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.220 
it may ruin the battery life it will
blink<00:03:22.919> really<00:03:23.370> fast<00:03:23.669> twice<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.480> speed<00:03:24.930> of<00:03:24.989> a

blink really fast twice the speed of a
regular<00:03:25.590> charge<00:03:25.919> and<00:03:26.819> that<00:03:27.060> basically<00:03:27.450> means

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
regular charge and that basically means

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.819 
regular charge and that basically means
its<00:03:27.989> power<00:03:28.260> charging<00:03:28.799> and<00:03:29.099> that's<00:03:30.829> rebuilding

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
its power charging and that's rebuilding

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.099 
its power charging and that's rebuilding
the<00:03:31.950> life<00:03:32.129> of<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.519> battery<00:03:32.870> building<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:33.989> back

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
the life of the battery building it back

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.979 
the life of the battery building it back
up<00:03:34.169> so<00:03:34.620> just<00:03:35.430> leave<00:03:35.609> it<00:03:35.760> for<00:03:35.879> 18<00:03:36.150> hours<00:03:36.299> without

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
up so just leave it for 18 hours without

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.689 
up so just leave it for 18 hours without
unplugging<00:03:37.109> it<00:03:37.590> should<00:03:38.340> be<00:03:38.489> good<00:03:40.250> all<00:03:41.250> of<00:03:41.549> that

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:41.699 
unplugging it should be good all of that

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:45.980 
unplugging it should be good all of that
under<00:03:41.970> three<00:03:42.209> minutes<00:03:42.980> roughly
