00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:13.080
 Hello, I want to tell you today 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.680
 Introduce new colleagues 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.730
 clubbed together barren haase cellar tank 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.039
 Can you solve this problem 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.199
 you want in your heating room 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.890
 subsequently a stable oil tank 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.080
 to install 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.140
 which is big enough around the whole 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.150
 but to take stock of oil 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.340
 conventional tank does not fit through the 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.430
 narrow hallway the steep stairs and the 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.809
 narrow door old you do not want 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.680
 because of the tank of a wall 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.870
 tear 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.510
 that is really no longer necessary 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.690
 since the haase keller tank exists 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.370
 ending with demolition and masonry work 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.989
 Its items are so small 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.260
 put together that they are practical 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.420
 fit all over and that's how it looks 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.390
 when a hare cellar tank is small 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.480
 through the door there comes the 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.589
 split outer base plate the 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.799
 inner floor panel the inner wall the 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.430
 outer wall of the two-part lid with 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:14.580
 one still as entry and the entry 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.439
 Cover all parts consist of 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.180
 high quality glass fiber reinforced 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:23.280
 plastic the so-called gfk outside and 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.409
 inside wall will be carefully with the 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.659
 double floor connected and hermi 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:33.659
 impresses laminated like a one-off 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:36.250
 now the lid and the cover 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.369
 for the entry 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:43.630
 finished so so is a hare cellar tank 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.630
 big in the cellar 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.100
 the inner wall has an upper surface 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.070
 when joining with the outer wall 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.409
 This creates a space between a 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.270
 leak indicator generated in this 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.880
 between a permanent under 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.159
 pressure at the slightest leakage 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:07.369
 gives the device immediately optical and 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:09.660
 Acoustic alarm is not safe 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.790
 that's why you can double- breasted haase 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.220
 cellar tanks just like that in the 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:18.209
 cellar places without additional 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.130
 drip pans tanks up to 5000 liters 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.790
 may even directly in the boiler room 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.440
 be installed next to the burner 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.140
 The rabbit cellar tank is a clean one 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.569
 no masonry work no 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.569
 no dirt no oil smell 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.020
 and through the transparent walls 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.520
 always look directly at the oil level 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.350
 Just think about it like you do 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:46.180
 the gained space in the clean oil 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.180
 want to use cellar in the future 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:54.440
 the five advantages of haase cellar tanks 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.709
 I'm sure you immediately recognized his 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.060
 parts fit virtually anywhere through 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.860
 That's why it is particularly suitable for 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.410
 the subsequent installation without 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:09.560
 Wall work, for example, in the frame 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:11.510
 a heating renovation because the rabbit 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.970
 basement tank double-walled and not 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.920
 only small amounts are needed 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.170
 wall distances to be adhered to 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.690
 a drip tray is not 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.550
 This saves a lot of space 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.550
 they can use elsewhere 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.659
 the material gfk is dimensionally stable odor 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:34.030
 tight and one hundred percent rustproof too 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:37.500
 in damp rooms with the annoying 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.500
 the smell of oil is gone 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.520
 for cleaning work is the tank 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.100
 through which you can still easily walk 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:48.030
 This saves effort and costs 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.030
 later tank cleaning 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.510
 and the best comes to the end of the bunny 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.879
 Keller cellar adapts to every cellar 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.159
 at three different diameters and 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:02.349
 selectable heights between one meter and one 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:06.040
 two meters fifty is also her of 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:10.530
 Strongly sure you know 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.530
 heating oil belonged to haase tanks
