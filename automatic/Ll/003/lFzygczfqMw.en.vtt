worm bins right there as well as the
raised<00:00:45.149> beds<00:00:45.600> for<00:00:45.960> example<00:00:46.409> that<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.679> see<00:00:46.889> and

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:47.159 
raised beds for example that you see and

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:49.669 
raised beds for example that you see and
of<00:00:48.089> course<00:00:48.329> will<00:00:48.600> also<00:00:48.870> be<00:00:49.019> grown<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> lot<00:00:49.530> of

00:00:49.669 --> 00:00:49.679 
of course will also be grown a lot of

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:52.549 
of course will also be grown a lot of
these<00:00:49.829> sprouts<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:51.049> salad<00:00:52.049> greens<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.319> herbs

these sprouts and salad greens and herbs

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.369 
these sprouts and salad greens and herbs
on<00:00:52.920> tables<00:00:53.909> which<00:00:54.359> we're<00:00:54.569> not<00:00:54.690> seeing<00:00:55.109> right

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
on tables which we're not seeing right

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.279 
on tables which we're not seeing right
now<00:00:55.409> these<00:00:56.039> are<00:00:56.249> temporary<00:00:56.670> ones<00:00:57.059> until<00:00:57.420> we

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
now these are temporary ones until we

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.829 
now these are temporary ones until we
build<00:00:58.530> all<00:00:58.769> the<00:00:59.010> infrastructure<00:00:59.629> that<00:01:00.629> will

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:00.839 
build all the infrastructure that will

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:03.199 
build all the infrastructure that will
fill<00:01:01.709> this<00:01:01.920> greenhouse<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.639> so<00:01:02.789> at<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.030> same

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:03.209 
fill this greenhouse and so at the same

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:05.060 
fill this greenhouse and so at the same
time<00:01:03.389> those<00:01:03.809> worn<00:01:04.260> bins<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.799> see<00:01:05.040> right

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
time those worn bins that you see right

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.940 
time those worn bins that you see right
there<00:01:05.780> will<00:01:06.780> also<00:01:07.080> have<00:01:07.290> two<00:01:07.530> levels<00:01:07.860> of

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
there will also have two levels of

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.800 
there will also have two levels of
tables<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.430> we're<00:01:08.610> building<00:01:08.760> tomorrow<00:01:09.150> and

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
tables that we're building tomorrow and

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.950 
tables that we're building tomorrow and
so<00:01:10.880> we'll<00:01:11.880> be<00:01:12.000> able<00:01:12.120> to<00:01:12.300> start<00:01:12.660> the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
so we'll be able to start the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.960 
so we'll be able to start the
germination<00:01:13.400> be<00:01:14.400> able<00:01:14.550> to<00:01:14.640> start<00:01:14.850> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
germination be able to start the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.900 
germination be able to start the
germination<00:01:15.420> right<00:01:16.290> up<00:01:16.500> there<00:01:16.770> above<00:01:17.730> those

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
germination right up there above those

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.090 
germination right up there above those
worm<00:01:18.240> bins<00:01:18.540> providing<00:01:19.380> shade<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.800> the<00:01:19.860> worms

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
worm bins providing shade to the worms

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.030 
worm bins providing shade to the worms
and<00:01:20.450> also<00:01:21.450> provide<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:22.470> know<00:01:22.560> we'll<00:01:22.800> start

and also provide you know we'll start

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.130 
and also provide you know we'll start
those<00:01:23.190> plans<00:01:23.490> germinate<00:01:24.060> them<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.390> then<00:01:24.480> take

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
those plans germinate them and then take

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.870 
those plans germinate them and then take
them<00:01:25.230> over<00:01:25.440> and<00:01:25.650> put<00:01:25.800> some<00:01:26.010> here<00:01:26.250> as<00:01:26.400> well<00:01:26.760> as

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
them over and put some here as well as

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.300 
them over and put some here as well as
on<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.090> next<00:01:27.390> level<00:01:27.690> above<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.230> so<00:01:29.100> we'll

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
on the next level above that so we'll

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.180 
on the next level above that so we'll
have<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.670> setup<00:01:30.000> I'll<00:01:30.600> be<00:01:30.630> fantastic<00:01:31.470> you'll
