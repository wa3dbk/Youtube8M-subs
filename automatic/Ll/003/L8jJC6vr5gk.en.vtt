00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.540
 so big thanks for the compliments 

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:11.700
 let's say I was a seer in the 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.130
 sense that they prepared the game 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.480
 telling the boys that against one 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:22.109
 such a team could not do it 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:23.880
 allow to grant a situation is 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.160
 unfortunately within two minutes we are 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.680
 went below two to zero 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.769
 among other things keeping the field a lot 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.890
 well because the first 20 minutes we have 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:39.420
 having held our head we kept the field 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:41.640
 we played with courage but one 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.760
 ball granted to 10 then we have 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.820
 wrong exit on the second and two a 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.110
 zero became difficult instead 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.260
 team is always 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.790
 has been careful has attacked with order 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.560
 sin 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.840
 on the occasion of cascione to the film in the 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.290
 The first half could be played 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.510
 reopen a game that maybe could 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.050
 allow you to believe more while in the 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.270
 second time I think that at times the inter 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:15.700
 has shown and confirmed what 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:20.520
 then result was on the field but me 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:23.560
 I believe this game has it anyway 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.240
 denoted an important step forward on the 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.500
 plan also of the personality of this one 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.180
 team 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.800
 in fielding what is then the 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.380
 his idea of ​​a game a game idea 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.820
 clear based on the research of 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.140
 quality of the dribble on to put 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.840
 the conditions our players of 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.990
 express myself to the fullest I believe that later 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.520
 a start in which I think the pescara us 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.430
 has put difficulties especially on the 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.580
 left lane is also pushed by 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:55.740
 this fantastic audience and inter then 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.390
 is gradually grown and has 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.799
 according to me then in the second half 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.510
 definitively legitimized a victory 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.040
 important 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.360
 we looked for the first second 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:10.479
 time at least me 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.550
 the team has a different way of pressing 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.800
 to go higher, however, is the skill 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:21.010
 of players that is probably also 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:23.680
 but when instead when we are there 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.420
 get up we have conquered who we are 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.870
 were more enterprising or at least the 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.870
 we looked like 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.860
 I believe that if on one side there is the 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.870
 inter ability 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.010
 in a sense there was also the 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.000
 give up because you do it well and then 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.040
 as it was in the first twenty minutes 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.739
 because we did it as a team with ci 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:52.200
 we probably gave nothing 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:54.660
 the technical skill of the inter and also the 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.310
 the condition because in the last ones 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.269
 weeks has played four games 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:04.910
 important and therefore probably have 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:08.700
 also in the legs a different condition 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.890
 but let us stay with our feet on the ground 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.319
 made according to me two excellent trips 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.209
 I am very happy to have succeeded in 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.870
 not to concede in three trips that was 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:22.230
 an important thing a signal of 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:26.269
 solidity that perhaps last year is missing 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.890
 but I don't know what they were telling me though 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.569
 for example the usual speech here 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.749
 talking to complain 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.239
 if he had been booed or not 

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:38.499
 what would have changed 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:42.129
 we would like to talk about inter at 0 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:42.639
 pity I had the idea it is clear that 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:44.260
 the inter 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.629
 I wanted him to come to pescara to play 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.489
 with two strikers and a playmaker 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:50.260
 philippe is an extraordinary player 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.500
 which is also an excellent moment of form 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.290
 but it has more external features 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.419
 of attack and then from the playmaker 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.269
 I really wanted to have two instead 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:02.859
 players always on the offside edge 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:05.980
 that would allow us to give the time to 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:09.159
 insertion or others I think is useless 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.790
 talk about the performance of a soldier 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.790
 goals and two assists 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.920
 there was no marking on the pole 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:23.190
 opposite there was the technical error 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:26.130
 on exit to bottom-up development 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.960
 the third goal we did not have not 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.920
 we kept the defensive line on 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.690
 first step so there is from 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.030
 to work 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.890
 we knew that the Inter strikers 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.200
 they could move in a certain way 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:43.860
 however beyond this for example the 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.140
 first goal was a mistake by a 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.830
 striker who did speak I speak 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:52.850
 inside in zanetti so I believe that 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:57.030
 beyond the individual individual error 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:59.100
 may have also been sought after by many 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:02.460
 what could have been avoided for 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.140
 grant a potential goal ball but from 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.169
 there is so much improvement I have already said 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.090
 we are happy because we are 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:15.570
 growing up following what then 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:20.600
 Our idea is obviously important 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:22.530
 to leave well even to give anyway 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.980
 followed what good we had 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.510
 done in the cup is however there is so much to 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.010
 work for so now already from 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:32.190
 Thursday with the fluids we try to center 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.450
 the qualification and then we will think about the 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.190
 tomorrow's game 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.020
 but let's see if I sincerely 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.710
 great confidence in those in the 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.710
 players I have 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.350
 I believe we have this evening too 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.139
 paid the price of this category 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:51.000
 which we met players 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:54.509
 really important as long as they are errors 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.539
 individuals can and can work there 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:58.979
 above and you have to work under it 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:01.530
 let me spend a word for 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:03.690
 castellazzi which are two transfers has 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:07.139
 made two incredible saves one up die 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:09.389
 and against the vaslui and on the one to zero e 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:10.110
 one today on 2 to 0 that could reopen 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:13.110
 the match 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:15.840
 and last year also about him and I have 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.400
 heard a few words too many 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.660
 even when he renewed today he has 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.470
 proved to be a goalkeeper from 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.949
 A league 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:25.680
 and as a great team there were few i 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:28.680
 minutes, however, were minutes 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:31.590
 important we returned at the end 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.840
 game with the regret of not having 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.849
 continued and granted those two 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.709
 goal balls that probably 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:41.589
 they brought the game on track 

00:06:38.709 --> 00:06:44.349
 other than what had been there 

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:47.860
 but for this very preparation there is 

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:50.529
 always been the awareness that 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:53.619
 Sooner or later you could hurt me 

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:56.249
 from there it is absolutely necessary 

00:06:53.619 --> 00:06:56.249
 work from there
