00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.369
 again and again you hear the statement of a player in a flight 

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:13.579
 I declare my ball lost 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:16.019
 is that possible? 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:20.169
 Let me clarify the problem with the following facts 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:21.599
 describe 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.069
 they play handball »from AP 

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:27.619
 in the direction of a forest 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.440
 since they are pretty sure to find the ball they give up on that 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.400
 play a makeshift ball 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.830
 after looking for her for two minutes and not finding her 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.010
 they say 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.250
 I can not find both of them anymore I'll give them back to you 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.359
 Tee and play a new ball 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:54.430
 while they go back to the tee 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.350
 call their teammates 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.330
 we found it in the forest 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:06.000
 the search time of five minutes to this point has not expired 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.230
 You can make your first choice within the five minute search time 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.640
 was found 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.360
 only play 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.700
 the answer to this question depends on it 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.010
 whether the first choice is still because in the game 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.280
 If the ball were lost he would not play with him anymore. ' 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.860
 the explanations to the golf rules agree with her 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.270
 a ball is a stroke to him soon the player on the tee 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.710
 has executed 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.080
 He remains playing until he is holed up unless he is lost in the 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.990
 August 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.710
 or he was picked up or replaced by another ball 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:48.590
 equal 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.950
 whether the spare parts market is or not 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.750
 without a new ball inserted 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.460
 with bars game 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.770
 This means that he soon became a game soon 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.390
 when they knocked him off the tee 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.940
 the crucial question is what is now 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.990
 how does this ball still play both teams 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.549
 of those mentioned in the explanations to the term ball team game cases 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:18.609
 in which a part is no longer in the game 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:22.329
 obviously only the case comes into consideration here 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:24.769
 that the first ball is lost 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.989
 because here the ball was neither holed nor was he in the off 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.669
 even before being picked up or replaced by another driver 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:37.299
 Montañes lost no ball 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.990
 this must say the explanations 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.460
 A ball is considered lost if he returns within five minutes of the party 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.840
 of the player or their caddy started the search for it did not find 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.330
 or not from the player as his own the the feeds are their odds 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:03:01.180
 because the search time of five minutes had not yet expired as the ball of 

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:03.689
 the other players was found 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:06.899
 the ball was not lost yet 

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:11.899
 Greed Ball but maybe because lost because they explained 

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:13.999
 that she will take him to the World Cup 

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:17.979
 or because they said I declare my ball lost 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.209
 they are neither in the explanations to the golf rules 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:29.089
 even in the gulf rules itself, the animal is soon considered lost 

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:32.069
 because she declared him lost 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.219
 Remember, then 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:39.799
 they can not explain their lost at not being lost 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.289
 of course 

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:45.840
 if the search time of five minutes has already expired 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.640
 and only then was the first job found or when at the time 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.519
 which was his first choice 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.499
 already knocked off a second ball from the tee 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.529
 because then the first ball is considered lost 

00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:07.629
 because they put another ball in with a penalty stroke and distance loss 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:12.789
 Have introduced themselves play in the above-mentioned facts 

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:15.939
 they found their pollen in the forest 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:17.039
 and play 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:19.539
 Vienna on the green 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.659
 after that, they realize 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:25.610
 that the five-minute seek time at the time 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:30.740
 when they played the ball on the green had already expired 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.219
 what are the consequences? 

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:38.080
 since the five-minute Zug time had already expired 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.280
 Their choice after the explanations to the term lost ball 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:46.789
 as lost 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:48.840
 this will result 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.400
 that he was playing ball as soon as they continued to play him shoe 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:00.289
 the consequence is 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.289
 they played a wrong ball 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.729
 because the explanations to the term wrong soon say that 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.340
 wrong ball is every other bale 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.759
 as the player both teams play 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:21.400
 the consequences of playing a wrong leg are usually 15 dash 3 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.949
 controlled 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:25.680
 There it says for the ten play 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.080
 makes a candidate a punch or beats Alba still a wrong one 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.600
 to Cities the penalty of two blows 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.639
 the ones made with the wrong ball and punches 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:44.009
 on the other hand, they are ignored when calculating the number of strokes 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.460
 In addition, she is playing through her mistake of making the right choice 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.599
 need to fix 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:57.060
 How do you not pick up your mistake before taking a hit on the next 

00:05:57.059 --> 00:05:59.469
 Have made a discount 

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:05.360
 or miss if it is the last hole of the untreated 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.759
 to announce the intention to remedy their mistake before leaving the green 

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:11.869
 leave 

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:14.869
 so they are disqualified 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:20.039
 it was a stroke of Stable 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:24.899
 However, the disqualification does not affect the entire game 

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:25.669
 out 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:28.040
 but only for the hole in question 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.020
 because diarrhea 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.919
 in which a disqualification 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:35.900
 and in the counting Max give locally 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.339
 led to a disqualification from the entire world game 

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:44.169
 usually 32 dash 2 AR 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:46.260
 are listed exhaustively 

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.399
 and not in Hebron of playing a wrong ball 

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:52.459
 is not there right now
