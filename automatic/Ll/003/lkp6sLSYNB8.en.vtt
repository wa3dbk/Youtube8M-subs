00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:07.509
 hello and welcome one more day and today you 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:11.410
 I come to bring the guide from 6 to 10 of the 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:14.519
 good watch box chess puzzles 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:17.560
 As you can see I am in chess 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.390
 exactly from this point on the map if 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.699
 we go to any other point of the 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:25.090
 map now I'm going to show you other points 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.949
 exactly for example in this me I 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:31.210
 I went to this to see if it could be done 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:34.239
 but just at that point the chess 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.670
 is different therefore I advise you 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:40.239
 that you come to this since both the guide 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:43.660
 previous like this is the one from 1 to 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:46.719
 5 and the 6 to 10 that are are in 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.600
 this point so let's go six there with 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:53.399
 three stars we will have to move this 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.399
 tab next to the white tower 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.160
 there we are the movement he will move us 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.680
 that tab there and we will return the 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.480
 pawn are two movements of the three 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.119
 stars are ours 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.520
 we have 6 with three stars we go to 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.340
 level 7 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.590
 We will take the tower and move it 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.969
 here 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.969
 he will move us 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.510
 we will take the horse we will move it to this 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.770
 position 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:29.340
 and now with the pawn just before the 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.850
 17 horse with three stars we are going to 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.180
 put the 8 we eat with the tower the 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.180
 pawn 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.430
 there we are going to move 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.430
 up to this position 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.290
 and now with the tower we advance 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.880
 until the end of the board and we have 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.880
 the three stars of this eighth level 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.560
 let's move to the end of the board 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.920
 we're just going to use this tab in this 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.180
 last 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.180
 we eat the horse 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.890
 and we move up to the side to 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:15.450
 lock her up and she can not go ninth 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:18.690
 level with three stars perfect and 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.690
 Let's go there 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.230
 as we see so far 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:30.470
 for the tenth level we eat it 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.470
 personal but good 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:38.390
 there we are and we just have to do 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.880
 there we are and the tenth level with three 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.590
 stars and this has been the guide 3 and 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.030
 it will be 10 and therefore we unblock 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.030
 the ability of maximum concentration
