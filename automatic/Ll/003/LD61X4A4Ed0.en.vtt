the<00:00:33.329> chaos<00:00:33.630> elemental<00:00:34.410> i<00:00:35.540> was<00:00:36.540> just<00:00:36.809> there

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
the chaos elemental i was just there

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.830 
the chaos elemental i was just there
just<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.260> few<00:00:37.290> minutes<00:00:37.590> ago<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:38.100> did<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.840> one-kilo

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
just a few minutes ago I did a one-kilo

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.020 
just a few minutes ago I did a one-kilo
just<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.500> find<00:00:40.710> out<00:00:40.890> how<00:00:41.100> fast<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.579> was<00:00:41.730> spawned

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
just to find out how fast it was spawned

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.090 
just to find out how fast it was spawned
and<00:00:42.420> actually<00:00:43.110> managed<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.410> get<00:00:43.590> this<00:00:43.800> as<00:00:44.040> a

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
and actually managed to get this as a

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.740 
and actually managed to get this as a
job<00:00:44.489> which<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.910> thought<00:00:45.149> was<00:00:45.270> actually<00:00:45.600> pretty

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
job which I thought was actually pretty

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.940 
job which I thought was actually pretty
good<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.260> know<00:00:46.289> if<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.500> could<00:00:46.590> get<00:00:46.770> this

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
good you know if you could get this

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.040 
good you know if you could get this
every<00:00:47.280> drop<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:48.329> would<00:00:48.480> be<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> very<00:00:48.930> good

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
every drop this would be a very good

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.139 
every drop this would be a very good
money<00:00:49.320> making<00:00:49.710> method<00:00:50.070> but<00:00:50.610> apparently<00:00:51.059> this

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
money making method but apparently this

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.540 
money making method but apparently this
is<00:00:51.300> just<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.660> common<00:00:52.110> drop<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:52.530> one<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.890> ten<00:00:53.190> you

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
is just a common drop so one in ten you

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.310 
is just a common drop so one in ten you
should<00:00:53.760> at<00:00:53.879> least<00:00:53.969> get<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.239> which<00:00:55.050> isn't

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
should at least get that which isn't

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.250 
should at least get that which isn't
that<00:00:55.350> bad<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:56.070> does<00:00:56.340> pay<00:00:56.550> for<00:00:56.850> your<00:00:57.480> arm<00:00:57.750> your

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
that bad it does pay for your arm your

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.279 
that bad it does pay for your arm your
weapons<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:59.010> everything<00:00:59.840> so<00:01:00.840> it's<00:01:00.989> very<00:01:01.109> good

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
weapons and everything so it's very good

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.009 
weapons and everything so it's very good
to<00:01:01.350> keep<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:01.800> mind<00:01:02.210> and<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.899> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
to keep that in mind and this is the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.200 
to keep that in mind and this is the
wilderness<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.860> make<00:01:05.400> sure<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.640> if<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.030> have

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
wilderness so make sure that if you have

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.530 
wilderness so make sure that if you have
got<00:01:06.390> every<00:01:06.840> sizable<00:01:07.409> map<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.979> make<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.430> big<00:01:08.700> it

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
got every sizable map to make it big it

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.570 
got every sizable map to make it big it
just<00:01:09.720> means<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:09.990> can<00:01:10.110> see<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.260> very<00:01:10.470> far<00:01:11.070> area

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
just means you can see a very far area

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.990 
just means you can see a very far area
and<00:01:12.530> most<00:01:13.530> people<00:01:13.619> quantity<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:14.220> far<00:01:14.460> so

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
and most people quantity this far so

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.340 
and most people quantity this far so
it's<00:01:15.090> always<00:01:15.210> good<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.450> keep<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.750> open<00:01:15.960> just

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
it's always good to keep this open just

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.539 
it's always good to keep this open just
so<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.500> can<00:01:16.590> see<00:01:16.650> who's<00:01:17.040> coming<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.460> who's

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
so you can see who's coming and who's

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.999 
so you can see who's coming and who's
not<00:01:17.790> coming<00:01:18.259> so<00:01:19.259> it's<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.409> very<00:01:19.439> good<00:01:19.590> idea<00:01:19.740> to

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
not coming so it's a very good idea to

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.800 
not coming so it's a very good idea to
keep<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:21.180> find<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.540> chaos

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
keep that and you find the chaos

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.929 
keep that and you find the chaos
elements<00:01:22.470> or<00:01:22.560> just<00:01:22.799> roaming<00:01:23.220> around<00:01:23.369> I'm<00:01:23.880> not

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
elements or just roaming around I'm not

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.560 
elements or just roaming around I'm not
doing<00:01:24.900> much<00:01:25.020> at<00:01:25.080> all<00:01:26.090> if<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.240> are<00:01:27.360> bringing

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.260 
doing much at all if you are bringing
food<00:01:27.869> make<00:01:28.259> sure<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.650> bring<00:01:28.799> food<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.520> once

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270

like some is pie if you eat it it will
leave<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.509> cake<00:01:36.930> tin<00:01:37.259> if<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.369> eat<00:01:38.579> curry<00:01:39.079> it

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
leave a cake tin if you eat curry it

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.200 
leave a cake tin if you eat curry it
will<00:01:40.290> leave<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.860> bowl<00:01:41.189> behind<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:42.030> it's<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.180> very

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
will leave a bowl behind so it's a very

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.800 
will leave a bowl behind so it's a very
good<00:01:42.390> idea<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:43.110> be<00:01:43.590> using<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:45.390> will

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
good idea to be using that and it will

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.020 
good idea to be using that and it will
boost<00:01:46.049> your<00:01:46.560> cures<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:47.009> think<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.850> it's<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.000> very

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
boost your cures I think so it's a very

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.429 
prepared let's see you will get so many
jobs<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.479> are<00:01:57.810> like<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.960> waste<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.380> time

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
jobs so that are like a waste of time

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.149 
jobs so that are like a waste of time
and<00:01:59.270> sorrow<00:02:00.270> booze<00:02:00.659> if<00:02:01.020> we<00:02:01.530> were<00:02:01.710> back<00:02:01.740> in<00:02:01.950> the

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
and sorrow booze if we were back in the

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.770 
and sorrow booze if we were back in the
days<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.700> would<00:02:02.969> have<00:02:03.090> been<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.240> good<00:02:03.479> drop

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
days that would have been a good drop

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.370 
days that would have been a good drop
but<00:02:04.560> nowadays<00:02:04.740> us<00:02:05.159> about<00:02:05.420> 100<00:02:06.420> coins<00:02:06.689> not<00:02:07.140> even

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
but nowadays us about 100 coins not even

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.940 
but nowadays us about 100 coins not even
that<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:08.009> it's<00:02:08.129> not<00:02:08.220> worth<00:02:08.429> even<00:02:08.580> picking<00:02:08.910> up

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
that so it's not worth even picking up

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.369 
that so it's not worth even picking up

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
experience rates though are not as good

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.170 
experience rates though are not as good
as<00:02:18.420> people<00:02:18.600> said<00:02:18.780> I<00:02:19.260> was<00:02:20.250> told<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:21.440> you

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
as people said I was told that you

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.090 
as people said I was told that you
should<00:02:24.180> be<00:02:24.300> getting<00:02:24.420> on<00:02:24.720> 200<00:02:25.320> to<00:02:25.440> 300<00:02:25.950> k

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
should be getting on 200 to 300 k

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.870 
should be getting on 200 to 300 k
experience<00:02:26.520> per<00:02:26.610> hour<00:02:26.840> but<00:02:27.840> if<00:02:28.400> that<00:02:29.400> was<00:02:29.610> true

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
experience per hour but if that was true

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.720 
experience per hour but if that was true
it<00:02:30.210> would<00:02:30.360> mean<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:30.570> it<00:02:31.050> would<00:02:31.230> respond<00:02:31.740> in<00:02:32.040> a

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
it would mean that it would respond in a

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.210 
it would mean that it would respond in a
second<00:02:34.910> you<00:02:35.910> can't<00:02:36.180> kill<00:02:36.300> it<00:02:36.420> very<00:02:36.630> fast<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:37.320> do

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
second you can't kill it very fast I do

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.120 
second you can't kill it very fast I do
get<00:02:38.400> around<00:02:38.520> 1.6<00:02:39.360> k<00:02:39.600> experience<00:02:40.020> /<00:02:40.140> kill<00:02:40.380> but

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
get around 1.6 k experience / kill but

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.000 
get around 1.6 k experience / kill but
the<00:02:41.370> response<00:02:41.610> time<00:02:42.030> is<00:02:42.090> forever<00:02:42.960> it's<00:02:43.890> about

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
the response time is forever it's about

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.900 
the response time is forever it's about
10<00:02:44.630> to<00:02:45.630> 20<00:02:45.840> seconds<00:02:46.290> I'll<00:02:46.410> say<00:02:46.680> so<00:02:47.340> we<00:02:47.730> are

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
10 to 20 seconds I'll say so we are

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.520 
10 to 20 seconds I'll say so we are
waiting<00:02:48.150> most<00:02:48.810> of<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:48.990> time<00:02:49.170> for<00:02:49.230> it<00:02:49.440> to

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
waiting most of the time for it to

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.700 
waiting most of the time for it to
respond<00:02:49.950> so<00:02:50.540> it's<00:02:51.540> not<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.960> best<00:02:52.140> experience

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
respond so it's not the best experience

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.760 
respond so it's not the best experience
per<00:02:52.800> hour<00:02:53.010> but<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:54.720> drops<00:02:54.990> are<00:02:55.110> not<00:02:55.380> bad<00:02:55.560> at

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
per hour but the drops are not bad at

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.040 
per hour but the drops are not bad at
all<00:02:55.950> I<00:02:56.270> worked<00:02:57.270> it<00:02:57.420> out<00:02:57.570> and<00:02:59.090> the<00:03:00.090> drops<00:03:00.480> you

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
all I worked it out and the drops you

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.350 
all I worked it out and the drops you
should<00:03:01.260> be<00:03:01.380> getting<00:03:01.500> on<00:03:01.800> 1<00:03:01.980> million<00:03:02.430> profit

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
should be getting on 1 million profit

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.550 
should be getting on 1 million profit
per<00:03:03.720> hour<00:03:03.900> just<00:03:04.890> on<00:03:05.390> common<00:03:06.390> drops<00:03:06.660> if<00:03:07.290> you<00:03:07.440> do

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
per hour just on common drops if you do

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.170 
per hour just on common drops if you do
get<00:03:07.740> like<00:03:08.150> those<00:03:09.150> corrupt<00:03:09.710> items<00:03:10.710> you<00:03:10.980> might

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
get like those corrupt items you might

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.630 
get like those corrupt items you might
get<00:03:12.180> a<00:03:12.210> bit<00:03:12.360> more<00:03:12.600> they<00:03:13.470> do<00:03:13.530> drop<00:03:14.100> but<00:03:14.550> this

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
get a bit more they do drop but this

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.120 
get a bit more they do drop but this
monster<00:03:15.120> does<00:03:15.300> drop<00:03:15.540> those<00:03:15.890> statues<00:03:16.890> that<00:03:17.070> are

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
monster does drop those statues that are

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.030 
monster does drop those statues that are
worth<00:03:17.370> like<00:03:17.700> 5<00:03:18.150> million<00:03:18.450> and<00:03:18.810> by<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:19.800> chance

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
worth like 5 million and by the chance

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.830 
worth like 5 million and by the chance
of<00:03:20.130> getting<00:03:20.400> nose<00:03:20.550> is<00:03:20.760> very<00:03:20.820> rare<00:03:21.270> so<00:03:21.750> I'm

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
of getting nose is very rare so I'm

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.290 
of getting nose is very rare so I'm
guessing<00:03:22.020> about<00:03:22.260> one<00:03:22.590> in<00:03:22.920> a<00:03:23.250> few<00:03:23.430> thousand<00:03:24.000> to

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
guessing about one in a few thousand to

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.680 
guessing about one in a few thousand to
get<00:03:24.480> one<00:03:24.660> of<00:03:24.750> those<00:03:24.840> jobs<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.940> I<00:03:26.940> do<00:03:27.300> think<00:03:27.630> you

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
get one of those jobs and I do think you

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.890 
get one of those jobs and I do think you
should<00:03:27.720> at<00:03:27.959> least<00:03:27.989> get<00:03:28.260> one<00:03:28.500> decent<00:03:29.430> job<00:03:29.900> every

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
should at least get one decent job every

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.890 
should at least get one decent job every
hundred<00:03:31.860> kilos<00:03:32.160> over<00:03:32.550> 200<00:03:32.970> kilos<00:03:33.239> you<00:03:33.720> should

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
hundred kilos over 200 kilos you should

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.410 
hundred kilos over 200 kilos you should
at<00:03:33.989> least<00:03:34.080> get<00:03:34.260> one<00:03:34.470> decent<00:03:34.920> drop<00:03:35.520> but<00:03:36.180> that's

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
at least get one decent drop but that's

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.390 
at least get one decent drop but that's
just<00:03:36.480> me<00:03:36.750> guessing<00:03:36.989> I<00:03:37.530> haven't<00:03:37.980> actually<00:03:38.100> been

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
just me guessing I haven't actually been

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.540 
just me guessing I haven't actually been
here<00:03:38.670> before<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:39.739> I've<00:03:40.739> never<00:03:40.770> had<00:03:41.280> the

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
here before and I've never had the

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.640 
here before and I've never had the
interest<00:03:41.880> of<00:03:42.030> coming<00:03:42.360> here<00:03:42.540> and<00:03:43.320> mainly

it's only about four to five Keo's I'm

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.750 
it's only about four to five Keo's I'm
just<00:04:11.340> do<00:04:11.489> this<00:04:12.080> in<00:04:13.080> about<00:04:13.590> 4<00:04:13.830> to<00:04:13.950> 5<00:04:13.980> q's<00:04:14.459> let's

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
just do this in about 4 to 5 q's let's

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.409 
just do this in about 4 to 5 q's let's
see<00:04:14.880> how<00:04:14.940> much<00:04:15.030> I've<00:04:15.209> gotten<00:04:17.060> I've<00:04:18.060> gotten

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
see how much I've gotten I've gotten

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.300 
see how much I've gotten I've gotten
about<00:04:18.540> 180<00:04:19.260> k<00:04:19.530> which<00:04:19.709> for<00:04:19.890> some<00:04:20.010> of<00:04:20.130> you<00:04:20.220> is

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
about 180 k which for some of you is

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.950 
about 180 k which for some of you is
quite<00:04:20.340> a<00:04:20.489> bit<00:04:20.640> of<00:04:20.730> money<00:04:20.760> and<00:04:21.120> for<00:04:21.660> doing<00:04:21.780> to

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960 
quite a bit of money and for doing to

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.310 
quite a bit of money and for doing to
surf<00:04:22.140> ukyo's<00:04:22.620> it's<00:04:22.860> very<00:04:23.430> decent<00:04:24.169> the<00:04:25.169> only

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
surf ukyo's it's very decent the only

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.080 
surf ukyo's it's very decent the only
problem<00:04:25.530> is<00:04:25.800> is<00:04:26.130> that<00:04:26.160> if<00:04:26.550> you<00:04:26.640> are<00:04:26.669> low-level

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
problem is is that if you are low-level

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.530 
problem is is that if you are low-level
you

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
you

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.680 
you
we'll<00:04:27.660> find<00:04:27.870> this<00:04:27.990> quite<00:04:28.290> hard<00:04:28.680> and<00:04:29.300> if<00:04:30.300> you

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
we'll find this quite hard and if you

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.110 
we'll find this quite hard and if you
aren't<00:04:30.900> range<00:04:31.590> based<00:04:32.070> you'll<00:04:32.670> find<00:04:33.000> this

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
aren't range based you'll find this

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.470 
aren't range based you'll find this
almost<00:04:33.480> impossible<00:04:34.170> and<00:04:34.820> it<00:04:35.820> is<00:04:36.000> weak<00:04:36.270> to

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
almost impossible and it is weak to

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.600 
almost impossible and it is weak to
range<00:04:36.720> so<00:04:37.260> that's<00:04:37.410> why<00:04:37.560> I'm<00:04:37.650> able<00:04:37.800> to<00:04:38.010> hit<00:04:38.220> very

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
range so that's why I'm able to hit very

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.480 
range so that's why I'm able to hit very
high<00:04:38.850> and<00:04:39.260> if<00:04:40.260> you<00:04:40.410> aren't<00:04:40.590> using<00:04:40.800> range<00:04:41.190> I

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
high and if you aren't using range I

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.950 
high and if you aren't using range I
showing<00:04:41.910> suggest<00:04:42.830> to<00:04:43.830> use<00:04:44.130> a<00:04:44.840> very<00:04:45.840> good

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
showing suggest to use a very good

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.700 
showing suggest to use a very good
weapon<00:04:46.140> that<00:04:47.070> could<00:04:47.520> basically<00:04:48.710> ma'am

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
weapon that could basically ma'am

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.070 
weapon that could basically ma'am
equally<00:04:50.310> loud<00:04:50.550> just<00:04:51.150> make<00:04:51.600> it<00:04:51.630> look<00:04:51.840> like<00:04:51.930> you

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
equally loud just make it look like you

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.690 
equally loud just make it look like you
are<00:04:52.110> using<00:04:52.410> range<00:04:52.770> but<00:04:53.190> if<00:04:53.310> you<00:04:53.400> aren't<00:04:53.580> using

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
are using range but if you aren't using

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.280 
are using range but if you aren't using
range<00:04:54.030> you<00:04:54.270> will<00:04:54.360> find<00:04:54.630> a<00:04:54.660> bit<00:04:54.780> of<00:04:54.900> problems

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
range you will find a bit of problems

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.200 
range you will find a bit of problems
here<00:04:55.560> and<00:04:55.770> but<00:04:56.310> you<00:04:56.340> won't<00:04:56.910> find<00:04:56.970> it

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
here and but you won't find it

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.450 
here and but you won't find it
impossible<00:04:57.330> and<00:04:57.960> bite<00:04:58.500> as<00:04:58.620> well<00:04:58.800> try<00:04:59.040> now<00:04:59.220> with

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
impossible and bite as well try now with

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.870 
impossible and bite as well try now with
anything<00:04:59.880> you<00:05:00.030> might<00:05:00.150> find<00:05:00.510> it<00:05:00.900> useful<00:05:01.880> don't

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
anything you might find it useful don't

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.370 
anything you might find it useful don't
need<00:05:02.970> good<00:05:03.090> thing<00:05:03.240> about<00:05:03.330> range<00:05:03.690> is<00:05:03.900> that<00:05:04.050> you

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
need good thing about range is that you

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.640 
need good thing about range is that you
can<00:05:04.620> stand<00:05:04.950> far<00:05:05.250> away<00:05:05.370> and<00:05:05.900> kill<00:05:06.900> it<00:05:07.050> that's

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
can stand far away and kill it that's

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.230 
can stand far away and kill it that's
pretty<00:05:07.800> much<00:05:07.980> the<00:05:08.040> only<00:05:08.190> benefits<00:05:08.790> of<00:05:08.970> being

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
pretty much the only benefits of being

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.740 
pretty much the only benefits of being
able<00:05:09.420> to<00:05:09.540> do<00:05:09.690> that<00:05:09.900> and<00:05:11.390> yeah<00:05:12.390> there<00:05:12.630> isn't

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.080 
able to do that and yeah there isn't
much<00:05:13.020> more<00:05:13.050> to<00:05:13.560> mention<00:05:14.130> to<00:05:14.160> be<00:05:14.340> honest<00:05:14.700> it

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
much more to mention to be honest it

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.450 
much more to mention to be honest it
does<00:05:15.300> have<00:05:15.480> a<00:05:15.510> few<00:05:15.720> special<00:05:16.110> attacks<00:05:16.440> and<00:05:16.710> it

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
does have a few special attacks and it

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.790

inventory<00:05:30.720> space<00:05:30.960> so<00:05:31.530> that's<00:05:31.680> why<00:05:31.830> I've<00:05:31.890> got

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
inventory space so that's why I've got

inventory space so that's why I've got
some<00:05:32.310> as<00:05:32.430> pie<00:05:32.640> and<00:05:32.880> not<00:05:33.030> like<00:05:33.210> rock<00:05:33.480> tails<00:05:33.750> or
