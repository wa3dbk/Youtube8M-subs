 q on the structure 

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:06.130
 I was struck by the fact that he has her drawings 

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:10.309

 cut off the head of egypt for over a week 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.640
 when I wrote about painting 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.640
 I was struck by the fact that time changes if 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.069
 who wants to bet 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:31.069

 Captain Haddock's story tells the story of his ancestor's adventures 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.780
 the painting that represented his ancestor I get off the wall 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.780
 and then falls on the head and it rips the table

 candle as the club site 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.570
 I was hit 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.690
 because 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.620
 in the work of HergÃ© 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.620
 there is the album called the broken ear 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.110
 and that the original merchant 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.140
 this taxation 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.430
 wrote these times of the totality of his work 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.500
 and by auchan the orchard I asked him what was his relationship to music 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.640
 and he said it's the most expensive way to make noise 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.990
 textile 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.740
 12 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.400
 and when one brakes flexed 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.850
 we are lined up 2 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.950
 in the beginning we are happy 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.940
 the table is prisoner 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.290
 the crooked antiquarian 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.560

 yellow card for the title since early 2011 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.720
 there was no further instruction 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.280
 sion m 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.810
 the deputies struction of the night 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.609
 there is a construction of a mine 

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:10.579
 whew 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:13.889
 m finally if the totality of this delay 6 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:19.939
 and I have the impression that this low gesture and two gestures founder of the new art 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:22.559
 kirby 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:24.759
 he also intends to act as if 

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:27.159

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.590
 e that height there missed total confusion 

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:34.449
 create a new art% by perceiving 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:36.849
 maybe unwittingly 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.979
 who was destroying all horcruxes 

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:41.039
 and listen 

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:42.519
 she could only displease 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.489
 and this complicity 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.489
 rarer at this fishing condition 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:50.749
 so that's why 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:52.659
 it interested me year 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:55.349
 everyone responds because catherine carpet department 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.259
 weeks that had arisen for others 

00:02:58.259 --> 00:03:00.009
 in high school for example 

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:02.309
 knowing very closely what is being said 

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:04.199
 some symbols 

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:07.909
 the tam-tam whooping cough on a trip to blowhole example 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:10.909
 I see being very very beautiful of all 

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:16.399
 6 it's a work 

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:18.029
 should I so I'm proud 

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:21.129
 the group lacks resources 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.129
 with the help of resources 

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:28.419
 he is besides the big next 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:30.479
