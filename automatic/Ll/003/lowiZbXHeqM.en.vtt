I'm<00:01:51.540> really<00:01:51.720> mad<00:01:51.899> but<00:01:52.170> I'm<00:01:52.259> just<00:01:52.350> gonna<00:01:52.470> hope

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
I'm really mad but I'm just gonna hope

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.069 
I'm really mad but I'm just gonna hope
that<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.790> gets<00:01:53.939> here<00:01:54.299> within<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.750> couple<00:01:54.960> of

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
that it gets here within a couple of

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.039 
that it gets here within a couple of
days<00:01:55.290> if<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.219> not<00:01:56.399> here<00:01:56.640> by<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.850> 23rd<00:01:57.689> I'm

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
days if it is not here by the 23rd I'm

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.590 
days if it is not here by the 23rd I'm
gonna<00:01:58.619> write<00:01:59.159> him<00:01:59.399> out<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.939> script<00:02:00.329> and

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
gonna write him out of the script and

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.530 
gonna write him out of the script and
just<00:02:01.320> start<00:02:01.649> animating<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.369> without<00:02:02.670> him<00:02:02.969> make

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
just start animating it without him make

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.080 
just start animating it without him make
him<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.960> don't<00:02:04.619> know<00:02:04.680> maybe<00:02:05.070> somewhere<00:02:05.579> else<00:02:05.640> I

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
him I don't know maybe somewhere else I

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.570 
him I don't know maybe somewhere else I
might<00:02:06.689> even<00:02:06.869> make<00:02:07.110> my<00:02:07.320> own<00:02:07.350> who<00:02:07.799> knows<00:02:08.039> but<00:02:08.369> at

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
might even make my own who knows but at

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.089 
might even make my own who knows but at
this<00:02:08.940> point<00:02:09.179> he<00:02:09.660> probably<00:02:09.840> won't<00:02:10.470> be<00:02:10.830> in<00:02:10.979> the

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
this point he probably won't be in the

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.230 
this point he probably won't be in the
video<00:02:11.370> because<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.730> need<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:11.940> store

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
video because I need to store

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.720 
video because I need to store
filming<00:02:12.570> very<00:02:12.900> soon<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.560> it's<00:02:14.010> very<00:02:14.250> unlikely

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
filming very soon and it's very unlikely

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.420 
filming very soon and it's very unlikely
that<00:02:14.880> he's<00:02:15.150> going<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.480> get<00:02:15.600> here<00:02:15.840> soon<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:17.070> yeah

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
that he's going to get here soon so yeah

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.100 
that he's going to get here soon so yeah
that's<00:02:17.820> basically<00:02:18.090> yet<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.630> hope<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:18.840> guys<00:02:18.960> are

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
that's basically yet I hope you guys are

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.470 
that's basically yet I hope you guys are

that's<00:02:40.920> when<00:02:41.160> it<00:02:41.250> gets<00:02:41.340> complicated<00:02:41.880> I'm

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
that's when it gets complicated I'm

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.480 
that's when it gets complicated I'm
thinking<00:02:43.230> of<00:02:43.320> canceling<00:02:43.560> that<00:02:43.830> series<00:02:44.370> now

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
thinking of canceling that series now

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.130 
thinking of canceling that series now
don't<00:02:44.700> go<00:02:44.790> crazy<00:02:45.060> I<00:02:45.330> don't<00:02:45.690> want<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:45.870> break<00:02:45.990> the

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
don't go crazy I don't want to break the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.990 
don't go crazy I don't want to break the
internet<00:02:46.470> or<00:02:46.590> anything<00:02:46.770> but<00:02:47.010> I'm<00:02:47.370> thinking<00:02:47.910> of

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
internet or anything but I'm thinking of

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.790 
internet or anything but I'm thinking of
canceling<00:02:48.240> that<00:02:48.690> series<00:02:49.170> just<00:02:49.560> because<00:02:49.740> I

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
canceling that series just because I

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.340 
canceling that series just because I
have<00:02:49.890> lost<00:02:50.130> interest<00:02:50.610> in<00:02:50.880> episode<00:02:51.330> 4<00:02:51.660> I<00:02:51.900> just

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
don't think it's very interesting and I

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.240 
don't think it's very interesting and I
just<00:02:54.120> know<00:02:55.050> I<00:02:55.080> just<00:02:55.170> don't<00:02:55.500> really<00:02:55.830> want<00:02:56.100> to
