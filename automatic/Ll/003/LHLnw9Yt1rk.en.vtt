00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.090 
hi my name is Dan Howry I'm a video game
programmer<00:00:03.149> in<00:00:03.570> Chicago<00:00:04.080> I<00:00:04.290> just<00:00:04.740> wanted<00:00:04.950> to

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
programmer in Chicago I just wanted to

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.519 
programmer in Chicago I just wanted to
share<00:00:05.339> a<00:00:05.779> project<00:00:06.779> I've<00:00:07.080> been<00:00:07.109> working<00:00:07.470> on

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
share a project I've been working on

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.610 
share a project I've been working on
with<00:00:07.680> you<00:00:07.830> guys<00:00:08.450> so<00:00:09.450> basically<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:10.170> get<00:00:10.260> rid<00:00:10.469> to

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
with you guys so basically to get rid to

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.110 
with you guys so basically to get rid to
it<00:00:11.420> working<00:00:12.420> on<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:13.190> ticket<00:00:14.190> an<00:00:14.280> old<00:00:14.460> RC<00:00:14.910> car

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
it working on a ticket an old RC car

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.689 
it working on a ticket an old RC car
that<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.420> had<00:00:15.630> from<00:00:15.839> when<00:00:16.020> I<00:00:16.109> was<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.260> kid

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
that I had from when I was a kid

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.970 
that I had from when I was a kid
basically<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.600> ripped<00:00:18.840> out<00:00:18.960> all<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.080> guts<00:00:19.380> this

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
basically I ripped out all the guts this

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.439 
basically I ripped out all the guts this
used<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.430> be<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.730> old<00:00:20.820> circuit<00:00:21.210> board<00:00:21.390> that

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
used to be the old circuit board that

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.950 
used to be the old circuit board that
was<00:00:21.630> in<00:00:21.750> there<00:00:22.400> looks<00:00:23.400> pretty<00:00:23.580> complicated

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
was in there looks pretty complicated

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.570 
was in there looks pretty complicated
basically<00:00:24.960> took<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.350> out<00:00:25.760> and<00:00:26.760> input<00:00:27.599> my<00:00:27.750> own

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
basically took that out and input my own

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.030 
basically took that out and input my own
yard<00:00:29.580> we<00:00:30.060> know<00:00:30.179> microcontroller<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:31.890> got

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
yard we know microcontroller that I got

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.540 
yard we know microcontroller that I got
from<00:00:32.219> Sparkfun<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:33.450> basically<00:00:34.399> ripped<00:00:35.399> out

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
from Sparkfun so basically ripped out

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.190 
from Sparkfun so basically ripped out
the<00:00:35.670> guts<00:00:35.880> put<00:00:36.210> in<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.480> Arduino

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
the guts put in the Arduino

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.869 
the guts put in the Arduino
microcontroller<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.100> I'm<00:00:38.219> using<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.550> to

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
microcontroller and I'm using that to

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.910 
microcontroller and I'm using that to
kind<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.390> like<00:00:40.040> control<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.219> RC<00:00:41.610> car<00:00:42.920> so

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
kind of like control the RC car so

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.209 
kind of like control the RC car so
basically<00:00:44.820> what's<00:00:45.360> happening<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:46.100> I've<00:00:47.100> got

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
basically what's happening is I've got

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.520 
basically what's happening is I've got
my<00:00:47.340> laptop<00:00:47.489> over<00:00:47.879> here<00:00:48.210> it's<00:00:49.050> connected<00:00:49.500> to

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
my laptop over here it's connected to

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.740 
my laptop over here it's connected to
our<00:00:49.649> Arduino<00:00:50.579> microcontroller<00:00:51.480> through<00:00:51.690> the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
our Arduino microcontroller through the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.930 
our Arduino microcontroller through the
USB<00:00:52.969> cord<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.690> got<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:55.230> C++<00:00:56.039> code<00:00:56.370> running<00:00:56.789> on

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
USB cord and I got a C++ code running on

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.020 
USB cord and I got a C++ code running on
the<00:00:57.059> laptop<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:58.170> can<00:00:58.350> see<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.030> visual

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
the laptop you can see this is a visual

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.930 
the laptop you can see this is a visual
studio<00:01:00.359> running<00:01:00.620> the<00:01:01.620> C++<00:01:02.340> program<00:01:02.699> and

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
studio running the C++ program and

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.620 
studio running the C++ program and
basically<00:01:03.660> what<00:01:03.870> happens<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:05.010> laptop<00:01:05.630> the

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
basically what happens is the laptop the

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.440 
basically what happens is the laptop the
code<00:01:06.810> on<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.700> laptop<00:01:08.700> handles<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.180> input

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
code on the laptop handles the input

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.510 
code on the laptop handles the input
from<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.659> Xbox<00:01:09.990> 360<00:01:10.590> controller<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:11.189> any<00:01:11.310> time

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
from the Xbox 360 controller so any time

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.600 
from the Xbox 360 controller so any time
I<00:01:11.549> hit<00:01:12.409> left<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.590> right<00:01:13.710> on<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.890> stick<00:01:14.159> or<00:01:14.490> up

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
I hit left and right on the stick or up

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.649 
I hit left and right on the stick or up
and<00:01:14.790> down<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.030> on<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:16.320> left<00:01:16.530> stick<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:17.659> input

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
and down is on the left stick that input

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.929 
and down is on the left stick that input
is<00:01:19.080> handled<00:01:19.439> then<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:20.130> can<00:01:20.250> see<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:20.729> the

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
is handled then you can see that in the

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.080 
is handled then you can see that in the
kind<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.869> like<00:01:21.990> dialog<00:01:22.680> box<00:01:22.950> window<00:01:23.280> here<00:01:23.580> of

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
kind of like dialog box window here of

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.149 
kind of like dialog box window here of
all<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.390> input<00:01:24.650> controller<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.920> pretty

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
all that input controller is pretty

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.539 
all that input controller is pretty
sensitive<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:26.759> there's<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:26.970> lot<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.240> data

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
sensitive so there's a lot of data

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.170 
sensitive so there's a lot of data
basically<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.790> laptop<00:01:30.119> sends<00:01:30.570> all<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.770> this

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
basically the laptop sends all of this

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.980 
basically the laptop sends all of this
input<00:01:33.180> serially<00:01:33.960> through<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.740> USB<00:01:35.130> cord<00:01:35.990> into

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
input serially through the USB cord into

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.630 
input serially through the USB cord into
the<00:01:37.229> Arduino<00:01:37.530> microcontroller<00:01:38.280> which<00:01:38.490> is

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
the Arduino microcontroller which is

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.630 
the Arduino microcontroller which is
listening<00:01:38.970> for<00:01:39.150> all<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.500> input<00:01:40.500> from<00:01:41.400> there

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
listening for all that input from there

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.200 
listening for all that input from there
the<00:01:42.649> Arduino<00:01:43.649> uses<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:43.979> motor<00:01:44.579> controller<00:01:44.759> that

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
the Arduino uses a motor controller that

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.460 
the Arduino uses a motor controller that
I<00:01:45.240> hooked<00:01:45.360> up<00:01:45.509> on<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.659> circuit<00:01:45.960> board<00:01:46.079> here<00:01:46.290> it's

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
I hooked up on a circuit board here it's

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.819 
I hooked up on a circuit board here it's
kinda<00:01:46.740> hard<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.920> see<00:01:47.130> but<00:01:48.439> basically<00:01:49.439> this

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
kinda hard to see but basically this

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.679 
kinda hard to see but basically this
motor<00:01:50.490> controller<00:01:50.820> right<00:01:51.000> here<00:01:51.060> controls

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
motor controller right here controls

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.910 
motor controller right here controls
these<00:01:52.470> two<00:01:52.680> wires<00:01:52.890> which<00:01:53.189> go<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:54.920> the

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
these two wires which go to the the

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.830 
these two wires which go to the the
drive<00:01:56.189> motor<00:01:57.560> so<00:01:58.880> which<00:01:59.880> makes<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.479> car<00:02:00.630> move

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
drive motor so which makes a car move

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.260 
drive motor so which makes a car move
back<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.170> forth<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:01.469> when<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.740> because<00:02:02.520> can<00:02:03.119> see

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
back and forth so when I because can see

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.020 
back and forth so when I because can see
here<00:02:03.450> when<00:02:04.079> I<00:02:04.110> hit<00:02:04.320> up<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.369> down<00:02:05.490> on<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.820> left

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
here when I hit up and down on the left

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.940 
here when I hit up and down on the left
stick<00:02:06.210> it's<00:02:06.450> going<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.630> move<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:07.079> car<00:02:07.380> forward

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
stick it's going to move the car forward

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.790 
stick it's going to move the car forward
and<00:02:08.459> backward<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:09.509> go<00:02:09.660> forward<00:02:10.110> if<00:02:10.349> I<00:02:10.530> press<00:02:10.679> it

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
and backward so go forward if I press it

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.160 
and backward so go forward if I press it
up<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.849> hit<00:02:12.000> down<00:02:12.270> I<00:02:12.599> move<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:12.989> car

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
up and I hit down I move the car

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.890 
up and I hit down I move the car
backward

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.800 

and<00:02:16.530> then<00:02:16.680> also<00:02:17.310> I<00:02:17.490> mean<00:02:17.880> that<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.330> other<00:02:18.450> side

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
and then also I mean that the other side

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.010 
and then also I mean that the other side
of<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.220> motor<00:02:20.220> controller<00:02:20.550> there's<00:02:20.870> goes<00:02:21.870> to

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
of the motor controller there's goes to

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.810 
of the motor controller there's goes to
this<00:02:22.170> steering

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
this steering

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.420 
this steering
so<00:02:24.090> basically<00:02:24.510> when<00:02:25.290> I<00:02:25.320> take<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.680> left<00:02:26.130> stick

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
so basically when I take the left stick

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.030 
so basically when I take the left stick
and<00:02:27.360> I<00:02:27.480> move<00:02:27.660> it<00:02:27.810> left<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:28.560> right<00:02:28.770> it's<00:02:28.950> going

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
and I move it left and right it's going

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.850 
and I move it left and right it's going
to<00:02:29.100> make<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.280> wheel<00:02:29.520> school<00:02:29.820> that's<00:02:30.000> not<00:02:30.090> right

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
to make a wheel school that's not right

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.500 
to make a wheel school that's not right
so<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:31.950> basic<00:02:32.220> idea<00:02:32.310> is<00:02:32.520> that<00:02:32.640> I'm<00:02:32.790> mimicking

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
so the basic idea is that I'm mimicking

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.950 
so the basic idea is that I'm mimicking
what<00:02:33.750> what<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.650> old<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:38.190> old<00:02:38.220> RC<00:02:38.610> cars<00:02:38.820> a

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
what what the old the old RC cars a

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.030 
what what the old the old RC cars a
remote-control<00:02:39.960> used<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.260> do<00:02:40.410> but<00:02:40.770> I'm

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
remote-control used to do but I'm

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.440 
remote-control used to do but I'm
basically<00:02:41.190> ripped<00:02:41.730> out<00:02:41.850> all<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.060> guts<00:02:42.240> and

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
basically ripped out all the guts and

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.040 
basically ripped out all the guts and
I'm<00:02:42.660> making<00:02:42.870> it<00:02:43.140> for<00:02:43.800> my<00:02:44.550> own<00:02:44.700> use<00:02:44.730> so<00:02:45.600> I<00:02:45.630> can<00:02:45.840> I

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
I'm making it for my own use so I can I

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.400 
I'm making it for my own use so I can I
can<00:02:46.290> for<00:02:46.440> one<00:02:46.560> use<00:02:46.740> the<00:02:46.860> xbox360<00:02:47.820> controller

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
can for one use the xbox360 controller

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.560 
can for one use the xbox360 controller
and<00:02:49.410> then<00:02:49.500> also<00:02:49.860> eventually<00:02:50.550> I<00:02:50.760> want<00:02:50.850> to<00:02:50.970> mod

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
and then also eventually I want to mod

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.770 
and then also eventually I want to mod
the<00:02:52.100> DRC<00:02:53.100> car<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.460> have<00:02:54.000> different<00:02:54.450> functions

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
the DRC car to have different functions

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.510 
the DRC car to have different functions
maybe<00:02:54.960> we<00:02:55.110> had<00:02:55.230> some<00:02:55.410> sirens<00:02:55.800> and<00:02:56.010> some<00:02:56.130> LEDs

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
maybe we had some sirens and some LEDs

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.160 
maybe we had some sirens and some LEDs
on<00:02:56.730> there<00:02:56.910> or<00:02:58.130> prop<00:02:59.130> perhaps<00:02:59.580> a<00:02:59.840> tilt<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.080> pan

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
on there or prop perhaps a tilt and pan

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.370 
on there or prop perhaps a tilt and pan
camera<00:03:01.770> or<00:03:02.190> something<00:03:03.000> like<00:03:03.120> that<00:03:03.380> but

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
camera or something like that but

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.290 
camera or something like that but
basically<00:03:04.500> about<00:03:05.190> ripping<00:03:05.760> out<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.030> guts<00:03:06.180> and

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
basically about ripping out the guts and

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.940 
basically about ripping out the guts and
net<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.600> adding<00:03:07.140> my<00:03:07.260> own<00:03:07.290> controller<00:03:07.770> in

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
net and adding my own controller in

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.020 
net and adding my own controller in
there<00:03:08.100> I'm<00:03:08.220> going<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:08.430> be<00:03:08.520> able<00:03:08.580> to<00:03:08.700> do<00:03:08.820> a<00:03:08.850> lot

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
there I'm going to be able to do a lot

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.480 
there I'm going to be able to do a lot
of<00:03:09.060> really<00:03:09.540> cool<00:03:09.690> stuff<00:03:09.890> by<00:03:10.890> programming<00:03:11.310> the

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
of really cool stuff by programming the

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.700 
of really cool stuff by programming the
Arduino<00:03:11.910> to<00:03:12.060> do<00:03:12.150> what<00:03:12.300> I<00:03:12.330> want<00:03:12.570> with<00:03:13.350> a<00:03:13.410> lot<00:03:13.590> to

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
Arduino to do what I want with a lot to

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.360 
Arduino to do what I want with a lot to
add<00:03:13.830> add-ons<00:03:15.560> for<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.680> future<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.010> project

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
add add-ons for the future the project

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.910 
add add-ons for the future the project
looking<00:03:18.290> definitely<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.350> car<00:03:19.530> right<00:03:19.680> now<00:03:19.710> is

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
looking definitely the car right now is

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.250 
looking definitely the car right now is
underpowered<00:03:20.360> I'm<00:03:21.360> going<00:03:21.690> like<00:03:21.840> full<00:03:22.050> speed

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
underpowered I'm going like full speed

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.200 
underpowered I'm going like full speed
right<00:03:22.440> now<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:23.130> it's<00:03:23.460> not<00:03:23.610> going<00:03:23.790> very<00:03:23.880> fast

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
right now and it's not going very fast

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.800 
right now and it's not going very fast
and<00:03:24.570> that's<00:03:24.690> because<00:03:25.880> it's<00:03:26.880> basically<00:03:27.690> just

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
and that's because it's basically just

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.660 
and that's because it's basically just
running<00:03:28.200> off<00:03:28.320> this<00:03:28.470> USB<00:03:28.890> cord<00:03:29.160> which<00:03:29.310> is<00:03:29.340> about

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
running off this USB cord which is about

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.830 
running off this USB cord which is about
5<00:03:29.940> volts<00:03:30.330> and<00:03:30.530> not<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:31.770> you<00:03:32.610> know<00:03:32.700> like<00:03:33.000> 175

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
5 volts and not and you know like 175

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.600 
5 volts and not and you know like 175
milliamp<00:03:34.590> Saur<00:03:34.830> something<00:03:35.100> like<00:03:35.190> that<00:03:35.370> so

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
milliamp Saur something like that so

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.390 
milliamp Saur something like that so
once<00:03:35.790> I<00:03:35.880> hook<00:03:36.030> it<00:03:36.180> up<00:03:36.300> to<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.890> this<00:03:37.890> bad<00:03:38.130> boy

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
once I hook it up to the this bad boy

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.330 
once I hook it up to the this bad boy
this<00:03:38.670> is<00:03:38.760> a<00:03:38.880> 9.6<00:03:39.630> volt<00:03:39.690> battery<00:03:40.310> which<00:03:41.310> is

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
this is a 9.6 volt battery which is

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.300 
this is a 9.6 volt battery which is
2,000<00:03:41.940> millaa<00:03:42.180> millaa<00:03:42.600> amps<00:03:43.140> that<00:03:43.950> should<00:03:44.160> get

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
2,000 millaa millaa amps that should get

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.090 
2,000 millaa millaa amps that should get
the<00:03:44.400> car<00:03:44.580> going<00:03:44.790> a<00:03:45.000> lot<00:03:45.180> faster<00:03:46.100> also

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
the car going a lot faster also

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.220 
the car going a lot faster also
obviously<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.450> would<00:03:48.600> suck<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:48.840> have<00:03:48.990> this

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
obviously it would suck to have this

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.740 
obviously it would suck to have this
cord<00:03:50.220> here<00:03:50.310> where<00:03:51.060> you<00:03:51.150> trying<00:03:51.360> to<00:03:51.390> drive<00:03:51.600> the

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
cord here where you trying to drive the

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.800 
cord here where you trying to drive the
car<00:03:51.960> so<00:03:53.090> basically<00:03:54.090> what<00:03:54.300> I'm<00:03:54.390> going<00:03:54.510> to<00:03:54.540> do<00:03:54.660> is

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
car so basically what I'm going to do is

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.800 
car so basically what I'm going to do is
I<00:03:54.840> got<00:03:55.230> a<00:03:55.260> ordering<00:03:55.950> a<00:03:56.040> blue<00:03:56.760> Smurf<00:03:57.120> Bluetooth

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
I got a ordering a blue Smurf Bluetooth

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.770 
I got a ordering a blue Smurf Bluetooth
chip<00:03:58.470> which<00:03:59.250> is<00:03:59.400> a<00:03:59.430> comes<00:03:59.820> from<00:04:00.000> Sparkfun

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
chip which is a comes from Sparkfun

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.380 
chip which is a comes from Sparkfun
it's<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.530> blue<00:04:01.710> blue<00:04:02.310> Smurf<00:04:02.610> gold<00:04:02.970> so<00:04:03.360> I

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
it's the blue blue Smurf gold so I

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.660 
it's the blue blue Smurf gold so I
ordered<00:04:03.750> that<00:04:03.840> it's<00:04:04.110> in<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.290> mail<00:04:04.530> so<00:04:05.130> my<00:04:05.430> next

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
ordered that it's in the mail so my next

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.130 
ordered that it's in the mail so my next
kind<00:04:06.030> of<00:04:06.090> big<00:04:06.210> task<00:04:06.450> with<00:04:06.660> this<00:04:06.840> will<00:04:07.050> be

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
kind of big task with this will be

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.830 
kind of big task with this will be
replacing<00:04:07.530> this<00:04:07.770> USB<00:04:08.040> cord<00:04:08.460> so<00:04:09.420> that<00:04:09.570> I<00:04:09.600> can

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
replacing this USB cord so that I can

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.540 
replacing this USB cord so that I can
talk<00:04:09.990> from<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.940> input<00:04:11.940> we're<00:04:12.060> going<00:04:12.090> from<00:04:12.450> the

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
talk from the input we're going from the

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.920 
talk from the input we're going from the
xbox360<00:04:14.550> controller<00:04:14.610> it'll<00:04:15.300> still<00:04:15.570> be<00:04:15.720> wired

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
xbox360 controller it'll still be wired

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.380 
xbox360 controller it'll still be wired
into<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.410> laptop<00:04:16.920> and<00:04:16.950> then<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.760> laptop<00:04:18.180> will

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
into the laptop and then the laptop will

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.070 
into the laptop and then the laptop will
communicate<00:04:18.960> wirelessly<00:04:19.799> through<00:04:20.340> bluetooth

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
communicate wirelessly through bluetooth

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.070 
communicate wirelessly through bluetooth
to<00:04:22.080> the<00:04:22.109> arduino<00:04:22.680> here<00:04:22.980> so<00:04:23.850> that<00:04:24.000> i<00:04:24.030> can<00:04:24.240> send

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
to the arduino here so that i can send

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.260 
to the arduino here so that i can send
all<00:04:25.200> my<00:04:25.350> input<00:04:25.680> input<00:04:26.010> commands

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
all my input input commands

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.380 
all my input input commands
and<00:04:27.600> have<00:04:27.840> it<00:04:27.960> operate<00:04:28.650> like<00:04:28.800> that<00:04:29.390> just

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
and have it operate like that just

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.000 
and have it operate like that just
finish<00:04:30.900> off<00:04:31.020> with<00:04:31.170> the<00:04:31.290> little<00:04:31.440> demo<00:04:31.680> if<00:04:31.860> it's

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
finish off with the little demo if it's

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.590 
finish off with the little demo if it's
just<00:04:32.160> going<00:04:32.430> back<00:04:32.610> and<00:04:32.670> forth<00:04:32.910> and<00:04:33.300> I<00:04:33.330> can<00:04:33.480> also

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
just going back and forth and I can also

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:46.400 
just going back and forth and I can also
do<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:35.150> hard<00:04:36.150> this<00:04:36.270> short<00:04:36.960> once<00:04:38.870> but<00:04:39.870> yeah<00:04:45.410> but

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
do the hard this short once but yeah but

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.870 
do the hard this short once but yeah but
yeah<00:04:46.590> does<00:04:47.070> about<00:04:47.220> it<00:04:47.400> and<00:04:47.550> thank<00:04:47.700> very<00:04:47.820> much
