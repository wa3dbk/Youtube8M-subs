00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.259
 previously I had already announced 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.240
 we would study a little bit 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.099
 different materials I made him the 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.900
 ice cream today we will go to 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.420
 the clay went to get it to the state 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.160
 natural then clay lie 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.410
 easily in wetlands 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.900
 such as lakes or small ponds 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.430
 when these are guided by the euro 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.500
 that we can go to the bottom and 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.570
 easily find clay here on 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.590
 is in a swamp where we will find 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.289
 also easy 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.739
 these sediments that will be sitting at the bottom 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.320
 at the bottom of the water and then yesterday who is 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.680
 finally transforms over the centuries 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.680
 in clay 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:58.520
 so here we start talking now 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:01:02.390
 he has the color changes right away he 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:08.570
 this is clay is not pure but she 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:18.470
 is still correct of the fight 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:19.460
 get it back in a bucket good after 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.020
 then it will be soon 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.020
 of course filter it 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.470
 once the earth pick up and treated on 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.240
 will do some small tests of 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.909
 cooking in a workshop to determine the 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.000
 different levels of temperature 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.130
 at what temperature the earth will cook 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.450
 perfectly 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.000
 and if not if you are a little too much 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.190
 impatient to use the land 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.340
 directly to the modeling if it is 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.019
 pretty plastic of course you see 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.789
 finally it's pretty easy to 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:10.200
 find this material directly in the 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.340
 nature 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.700
 especially since it is quite expensive in the 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.330
 trade so have it for free by 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.980
 people 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.900
 obviously you know was not going 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.709
 not on a field to make holes 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.420
 everywhere is not asked 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.160
 nicely an owner or so 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.890
 took advantage of an opportunity when a 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.819
 municipality for example the lives of some 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.530
 being here that's it I hope this 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.570
 video will have pleased you do not hesitate to 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.609
 share on social networks to me
