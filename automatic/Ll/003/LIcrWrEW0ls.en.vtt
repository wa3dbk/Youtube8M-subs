is a very very very easy project it's

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.510 
is a very very very easy project it's
gonna<00:00:17.789> be<00:00:18.030> one<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.390> shorter<00:00:18.720> tutorials

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520

gonna be one of the shorter tutorials
here's<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.580> little<00:00:20.820> fortune<00:00:21.060> cookie<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:21.900> can

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
here's a little fortune cookie you can

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.990 
here's a little fortune cookie you can
see<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.350> size<00:00:22.530> it's<00:00:22.860> more<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.400> size<00:00:23.610> for<00:00:23.970> a

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
see the size it's more of a size for a

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.250 
see the size it's more of a size for a
necklace<00:00:24.270> or<00:00:24.690> a<00:00:24.720> charm

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
necklace or a charm

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.740 
necklace or a charm
rather<00:00:25.920> than<00:00:26.190> miniature<00:00:27.090> miniature<00:00:27.480> but<00:00:27.630> you

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
rather than miniature miniature but you

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.690 
rather than miniature miniature but you
could<00:00:27.990> easily<00:00:28.830> scale<00:00:29.490> this<00:00:29.670> down<00:00:30.380> okay<00:00:31.700> so

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
could easily scale this down okay so

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.510 
could easily scale this down okay so
basically<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.750> took<00:00:33.870> some<00:00:34.230> accrue<00:00:34.800> from<00:00:35.040> primo

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
basically I took some accrue from primo

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.569 
basically I took some accrue from primo
and<00:00:36.230> you<00:00:37.230> need<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.500> condition<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:38.100> thoroughly

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
and you need to condition it thoroughly

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.780 
and you need to condition it thoroughly
I<00:00:39.350> went<00:00:40.350> ahead<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.739> rolled<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.100> out<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:41.520> is

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
I went ahead and I rolled it out this is

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.950 
I went ahead and I rolled it out this is
the<00:00:43.250> the<00:00:44.250> third<00:00:44.430> setting<00:00:44.910> on<00:00:45.090> my<00:00:45.120> polished

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
the the third setting on my polished

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.380 
the the third setting on my polished
pasta<00:00:46.829> roller<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.670> third<00:00:47.910> setting

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
pasta roller so is the third setting

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.940 
pasta roller so is the third setting
from<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.840> thickest<00:00:49.309> now<00:00:50.309> from<00:00:50.579> here<00:00:51.710> you<00:00:52.710> take

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
from the thickest now from here you take

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.830 
from the thickest now from here you take
a<00:00:53.129> little<00:00:53.340> bit<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.610> flour<00:00:56.270> it<00:00:57.270> actually<00:00:57.660> took

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
a little bit of flour it actually took

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.360 
a little bit of flour it actually took
me<00:00:57.899> awhile<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:59.329> discover<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.510> texture<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.410> I

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
me awhile to discover this texture and I

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.340 
me awhile to discover this texture and I
textured<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.210> actually<00:01:03.480> discovered<00:01:04.049> this

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
textured I actually discovered this

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.050 
textured I actually discovered this
texture<00:01:04.799> when<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.010> was<00:01:05.250> doing<00:01:05.400> my<00:01:05.549> fortune

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
texture when I was doing my fortune

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.120 
texture when I was doing my fortune
cookies<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.690> tried<00:01:07.440> a<00:01:07.470> whole<00:01:07.770> bunch<00:01:08.040> of

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
cookies I tried a whole bunch of

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.070 
cookies I tried a whole bunch of
different<00:01:08.490> things<00:01:08.520> but<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.479> put<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> little<00:01:09.900> bit

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
different things but I put a little bit

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.969 
different things but I put a little bit
of<00:01:10.229> flour<00:01:10.440> on<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.220> top<00:01:12.350> that's<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.560> keep<00:01:13.770> it

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
of flour on the top that's to keep it

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.780 
of flour on the top that's to keep it
from<00:01:14.130> sticking<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:15.210> itself<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:16.310> then<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.340> flip

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
from sticking to itself and then I flip

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.990 
from sticking to itself and then I flip
it<00:01:17.880> over<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.439> I<00:01:19.439> go<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.830> circles<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.490> texture

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
it over and I go in circles to texture

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.390 
it over and I go in circles to texture
now<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:22.310> do<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.670> for<00:01:23.880> quite<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.180> long<00:01:24.390> time<00:01:28.400> I'm

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
now I do that for quite a long time I'm

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.990 
now I do that for quite a long time I'm
fairly<00:01:29.759> rough<00:01:30.119> about<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:33.890> and<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:35.580> keep<00:01:35.820> going

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
fairly rough about it and I keep going

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.230 
fairly rough about it and I keep going
and<00:01:36.299> going<00:01:40.280> this<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.520> definitely<00:01:41.640> want<00:01:42.180> to

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
and going this you definitely want to

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.679 
and going this you definitely want to
use<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.540> flour<00:01:42.780> for<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.320> not<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.590> cornstarch

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
use the flour for and not the cornstarch

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:47.539 
use the flour for and not the cornstarch
the<00:01:45.689> flour<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.259> bit<00:01:46.470> coarser<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.400> will

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
the flour is a bit coarser so it will

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.710 
the flour is a bit coarser so it will
give<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.820> much<00:01:48.060> nicer<00:01:48.360> texture<00:01:50.570> you<00:01:51.570> need

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
give you a much nicer texture you need

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.149 
give you a much nicer texture you need
to<00:01:51.780> make<00:01:51.930> sure<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.200> thoroughly<00:01:52.380> conditioned

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
to make sure it's thoroughly conditioned

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.880 
to make sure it's thoroughly conditioned
so<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.520> won't<00:01:53.729> crack<00:01:56.600> after<00:01:57.600> its<00:01:58.290> baked<00:01:58.530> it's

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
so it won't crack after its baked it's

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.500 
so it won't crack after its baked it's
not<00:01:59.040> gonna<00:01:59.189> crack<00:01:59.490> now<00:01:59.729> but

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
not gonna crack now but

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.060 
not gonna crack now but
but<00:02:01.840> if<00:02:01.930> you<00:02:02.020> don't<00:02:02.200> thoroughly<00:02:02.380> condition<00:02:02.980> it

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
but if you don't thoroughly condition it

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.640 
but if you don't thoroughly condition it
before<00:02:03.400> breaking<00:02:03.880> before<00:02:04.600> baking<00:02:04.990> it<00:02:05.320> it

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
before breaking before baking it it

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.020 
before breaking before baking it it
could<00:02:06.210> so<00:02:07.210> as<00:02:07.630> you<00:02:07.840> can<00:02:07.990> see<00:02:08.260> I<00:02:08.500> do<00:02:09.490> this<00:02:09.820> for

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
could so as you can see I do this for

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.350 
could so as you can see I do this for
quite<00:02:10.240> a<00:02:10.270> while<00:02:13.350> if<00:02:14.350> I<00:02:15.220> recall<00:02:15.400> right<00:02:15.940> with<00:02:16.210> my

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
quite a while if I recall right with my

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.610 
quite a while if I recall right with my
first<00:02:16.690> batch<00:02:16.960> I<00:02:18.990> probably<00:02:19.990> did<00:02:20.140> it<00:02:20.260> three<00:02:20.530> to

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
first batch I probably did it three to

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.890 
first batch I probably did it three to
four<00:02:20.860> minutes<00:02:21.250> I<00:02:23.940> take<00:02:24.940> my<00:02:25.120> round<00:02:25.330> cookie

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
four minutes I take my round cookie

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.440 
four minutes I take my round cookie
cutter<00:02:25.930> it's<00:02:26.580> actually<00:02:27.580> a<00:02:27.610> full<00:02:27.970> inch<00:02:28.240> in

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
cutter it's actually a full inch in

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.650 
cutter it's actually a full inch in
diameter<00:02:28.660> you<00:02:29.230> could<00:02:29.410> change<00:02:29.740> your<00:02:30.270> sizes<00:02:31.270> if

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
diameter you could change your sizes if
