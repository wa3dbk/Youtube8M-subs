00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.159 
though broken front wing and from that
he<00:02:53.859> was<00:02:53.950> never<00:02:54.069> likely<00:02:54.310> to<00:02:54.549> recover<00:02:54.989> new<00:02:55.989> set

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:56.169 
he was never likely to recover new set

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:58.229 
he was never likely to recover new set
of<00:02:56.290> tires<00:02:56.409> he<00:02:56.650> put<00:02:56.829> on<00:02:56.980> when<00:02:57.489> working<00:02:57.700> for<00:02:58.090> him

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
of tires he put on when working for him

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.390 
of tires he put on when working for him
he<00:02:58.329> had<00:02:58.450> to<00:02:58.540> pit<00:02:58.659> again<00:02:58.989> I<00:02:59.620> think<00:03:00.069> if<00:03:00.280> something

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
he had to pit again I think if something

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.800 
he had to pit again I think if something
like<00:03:00.519> four<00:03:00.730> or<00:03:00.849> five<00:03:00.909> pit<00:03:01.239> stops<00:03:01.480> in<00:03:01.629> the<00:03:01.659> end

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810

just<00:04:36.219> didn't<00:04:36.520> give<00:04:36.550> enough<00:04:36.669> time<00:04:36.939> and<00:04:37.569> I<00:04:38.050> think

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
just didn't give enough time and I think

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.779 
just didn't give enough time and I think
that<00:04:38.349> was<00:04:38.439> his<00:04:38.529> own<00:04:38.680> frustration<00:04:39.430> in<00:04:39.639> a<00:04:39.699> way

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:39.789 
that was his own frustration in a way

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:41.790 
that was his own frustration in a way
fell<00:04:40.059> into<00:04:40.180> a<00:04:40.300> similar<00:04:40.689> gap<00:04:41.020> to<00:04:41.229> Jensen<00:04:41.650> I

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
fell into a similar gap to Jensen I

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.249 
fell into a similar gap to Jensen I
think<00:04:42.219> they<00:04:42.309> see<00:04:42.370> the<00:04:42.729> HRT<00:04:43.270> they<00:04:43.779> consider<00:04:44.139> it

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:44.259 
think they see the HRT they consider it

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:46.290 
think they see the HRT they consider it
to<00:04:44.349> be<00:04:44.379> so<00:04:44.650> slow<00:04:45.069> and<00:04:45.249> utterly<00:04:45.580> useless<00:04:45.819> that

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
to be so slow and utterly useless that

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.390 
to be so slow and utterly useless that
they<00:04:46.449> just<00:04:46.689> you<00:04:47.259> know<00:04:47.319> wish<00:04:47.620> it<00:04:47.800> wasn't<00:04:48.189> there

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
they just you know wish it wasn't there

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.399 
they just you know wish it wasn't there
but<00:04:48.669> you<00:04:48.789> can't<00:04:49.089> the<00:04:49.449> car<00:04:49.659> is<00:04:49.809> actually<00:04:49.990> there

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:50.409 
but you can't the car is actually there

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:52.260 
but you can't the car is actually there
whether<00:04:50.919> he's<00:04:51.039> made<00:04:51.219> a<00:04:51.249> mistake<00:04:51.639> whatever<00:04:52.029> you

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
whether he's made a mistake whatever you

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.939 
whether he's made a mistake whatever you
have<00:04:52.479> to<00:04:52.659> account<00:04:52.960> for<00:04:53.110> that<00:04:53.289> car<00:04:53.529> is<00:04:53.710> there

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:53.949 
have to account for that car is there

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:55.559 
have to account for that car is there
he's<00:04:54.189> moving<00:04:54.550> at<00:04:54.669> a<00:04:54.699> similar<00:04:54.879> pace<00:04:55.210> and<00:04:55.449> you're

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:55.569 
he's moving at a similar pace and you're

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:57.480 
he's moving at a similar pace and you're
going<00:04:55.719> to<00:04:55.779> have<00:04:55.930> to<00:04:56.139> overtake<00:04:56.979> him<00:04:57.219> and<00:04:57.400> give

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
going to have to overtake him and give

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:58.920 
going to have to overtake him and give
him<00:04:57.520> a<00:04:57.699> wide<00:04:57.879> berth<00:04:57.909> everything<00:04:58.689> else<00:04:58.839> that

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
him a wide berth everything else that

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.779 
him a wide berth everything else that
means<00:04:59.139> dirtying<00:04:59.620> your<00:04:59.710> ties<00:04:59.949> for<00:05:00.189> a<00:05:00.219> second<00:05:00.610> so

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
means dirtying your ties for a second so

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:02.820 
means dirtying your ties for a second so
be<00:05:00.969> it<00:05:01.120> I<00:05:01.300> think<00:05:01.689> Celtic<00:05:01.900> can<00:05:02.139> probably<00:05:02.650> should

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
be it I think Celtic can probably should

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.489 
be it I think Celtic can probably should
move<00:05:03.009> off<00:05:03.189> the<00:05:03.309> racing<00:05:03.669> line<00:05:03.699> when<00:05:04.120> there's<00:05:04.330> a

00:05:04.489 --> 00:05:04.499 
move off the racing line when there's a

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:06.689 
move off the racing line when there's a
world<00:05:05.499> championship<00:05:05.889> leader<00:05:06.159> coming<00:05:06.520> past

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:06.699 
world championship leader coming past

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:09.629 
world championship leader coming past
him<00:05:06.999> but<00:05:07.479> either<00:05:07.599> way<00:05:07.809> I<00:05:08.319> think<00:05:09.249> it's

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 
him but either way I think it's

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:11.639 
him but either way I think it's
certainly<00:05:10.149> food<00:05:10.689> for<00:05:10.899> thought<00:05:11.050> and<00:05:11.229> I<00:05:11.319> don't

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:11.649 
certainly food for thought and I don't

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:13.529 
certainly food for thought and I don't
think<00:05:11.860> Sebastian<00:05:12.339> Vettel<00:05:12.639> or<00:05:12.879> jenson<00:05:13.270> button

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:13.539 
think Sebastian Vettel or jenson button

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:15.629 
think Sebastian Vettel or jenson button
will<00:05:13.899> be<00:05:13.990> making<00:05:14.169> that<00:05:14.469> mistake<00:05:14.559> again<00:05:14.949> any

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 
will be making that mistake again any

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:17.790 
will be making that mistake again any
time<00:05:15.789> soon<00:05:15.969> I'd<00:05:16.930> say<00:05:17.139> one<00:05:17.379> of<00:05:17.409> the<00:05:17.469> highlights

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
time soon I'd say one of the highlights

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.170 
time soon I'd say one of the highlights
that<00:05:17.949> they<00:05:18.069> has<00:05:18.249> to<00:05:18.399> be<00:05:19.499> Bruno<00:05:20.499> Senna<00:05:20.710> and<00:05:21.180> Kimi

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
that they has to be Bruno Senna and Kimi

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.059 
that they has to be Bruno Senna and Kimi
Raikkonen<00:05:22.629> they<00:05:23.229> were<00:05:23.379> both<00:05:23.589> doing<00:05:23.830> a

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:24.069 
Raikkonen they were both doing a

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:26.459 
Raikkonen they were both doing a
fantastic<00:05:24.550> job<00:05:24.819> all<00:05:25.300> day<00:05:25.360> really<00:05:26.110> solid

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:26.469 
fantastic job all day really solid

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:28.469 
fantastic job all day really solid
drives<00:05:26.740> from<00:05:26.949> both<00:05:27.189> guys<00:05:27.460> and<00:05:27.729> I<00:05:28.149> was<00:05:28.240> really

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
drives from both guys and I was really

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:29.969 
drives from both guys and I was really
pleased<00:05:28.749> to<00:05:28.899> see<00:05:28.990> them<00:05:29.319> working<00:05:29.469> the<00:05:29.710> way<00:05:29.830> up

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979 
pleased to see them working the way up

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:31.920 
pleased to see them working the way up
the<00:05:30.159> order<00:05:30.309> and<00:05:30.520> coming<00:05:30.819> in<00:05:30.969> I<00:05:31.149> think<00:05:31.509> overall

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
the order and coming in I think overall

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.689 
the order and coming in I think overall
it<00:05:32.289> was<00:05:32.379> a<00:05:32.409> very<00:05:32.469> positive<00:05:32.800> race<00:05:33.339> for<00:05:33.610> those

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:33.699 
it was a very positive race for those

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:36.420 
it was a very positive race for those
kind<00:05:33.969> of<00:05:34.029> conditions<00:05:34.240> the<00:05:35.110> cars<00:05:35.349> were<00:05:35.620> widely

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
kind of conditions the cars were widely

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.050 
kind of conditions the cars were widely
split<00:05:37.089> at<00:05:37.479> the<00:05:37.659> end<00:05:37.839> but<00:05:38.409> at<00:05:38.529> the<00:05:38.589> same<00:05:38.770> time<00:05:39.060> it

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
split at the end but at the same time it

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.790 
split at the end but at the same time it
showed<00:05:40.300> that<00:05:40.330> there<00:05:40.539> is<00:05:40.689> potential<00:05:41.499> to<00:05:41.680> that

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
showed that there is potential to that

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.529 
showed that there is potential to that
Ferrari<00:05:42.219> there's<00:05:42.520> no<00:05:42.639> doubt<00:05:42.819> about<00:05:42.849> it<00:05:43.120> and<00:05:43.509> I

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:43.539 
Ferrari there's no doubt about it and I

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:45.089 
Ferrari there's no doubt about it and I
think<00:05:43.719> if<00:05:43.810> they<00:05:43.899> can<00:05:44.080> fix<00:05:44.289> those<00:05:44.469> elements<00:05:44.709> and

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:45.099 
think if they can fix those elements and

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:46.019 
think if they can fix those elements and
they<00:05:45.159> say<00:05:45.339> there's<00:05:45.550> a<00:05:45.610> new<00:05:45.759> front<00:05:45.969> suspension

00:05:46.019 --> 00:05:46.029 
they say there's a new front suspension

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:49.260 
they say there's a new front suspension
and<00:05:46.629> new<00:05:46.719> bits<00:05:46.930> coming<00:05:47.169> for<00:05:47.379> Barcelona<00:05:48.270> Force

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
and new bits coming for Barcelona Force

and new bits coming for Barcelona Force
India<00:05:49.629> say<00:05:49.870> they've<00:05:50.080> got<00:05:50.259> a<00:05:50.289> major<00:05:50.529> upgrade

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
India say they've got a major upgrade

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.309 
India say they've got a major upgrade
coming<00:05:51.399> sometime<00:05:51.669> around<00:05:52.479> May<00:05:52.870> something

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:53.319 
coming sometime around May something

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:54.269 
coming sometime around May something
like<00:05:53.439> that<00:05:53.589> which<00:05:53.740> is<00:05:53.770> going<00:05:54.009> to<00:05:54.069> transform

00:05:54.269 --> 00:05:54.279 
like that which is going to transform

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:55.649 
like that which is going to transform
their<00:05:54.699> performance<00:05:55.180> that'll<00:05:55.389> be<00:05:55.539> interesting

00:05:55.649 --> 00:05:55.659 
their performance that'll be interesting

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:58.079 
their performance that'll be interesting
to<00:05:56.139> see<00:05:56.319> salba<00:05:56.979> seem<00:05:57.159> to<00:05:57.249> be<00:05:57.370> doing<00:05:57.490> very<00:05:57.849> well

00:05:58.079 --> 00:05:58.089 
to see salba seem to be doing very well

00:05:58.089 --> 00:05:59.610 
to see salba seem to be doing very well
very<00:05:58.330> strong<00:05:58.689> in<00:05:58.810> the<00:05:58.899> first<00:05:59.110> couple<00:05:59.229> of<00:05:59.409> races

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
very strong in the first couple of races

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.699 
very strong in the first couple of races
and<00:06:00.479> of<00:06:01.479> course<00:06:01.749> McLaren<00:06:02.229> in<00:06:02.379> dry<00:06:02.649> conditions

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:02.709 
and of course McLaren in dry conditions

00:06:02.709 --> 00:06:05.369 
and of course McLaren in dry conditions
they<00:06:03.669> were<00:06:04.089> force<00:06:04.360> to<00:06:04.539> be<00:06:04.659> reckoned<00:06:04.689> with<00:06:05.080> I

00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:05.379 
they were force to be reckoned with I

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:07.739 
they were force to be reckoned with I
think<00:06:05.830> we<00:06:05.919> go<00:06:06.039> to<00:06:06.099> China<00:06:06.459> with<00:06:06.759> McLaren<00:06:07.509> still

00:06:07.739 --> 00:06:07.749 
think we go to China with McLaren still

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:09.420 
think we go to China with McLaren still
being<00:06:07.959> by<00:06:08.169> far<00:06:08.199> the<00:06:08.559> strongest<00:06:08.740> package<00:06:09.249> out

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
being by far the strongest package out

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:10.499 
being by far the strongest package out
there<00:06:09.459> and<00:06:09.759> I<00:06:09.789> think<00:06:09.969> it<00:06:10.059> really<00:06:10.149> does<00:06:10.360> depend

00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:10.509 
there and I think it really does depend

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:12.719 
there and I think it really does depend
on<00:06:10.779> the<00:06:10.870> weather<00:06:10.959> conditions<00:06:11.110> again<00:06:11.800> and<00:06:12.009> what

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:12.729 
on the weather conditions again and what

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:14.519 
on the weather conditions again and what
they're<00:06:12.909> learning<00:06:13.120> about<00:06:13.539> these<00:06:13.779> Pirelli

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:14.529 
they're learning about these Pirelli

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:16.639 
they're learning about these Pirelli
tires<00:06:14.860> how<00:06:15.249> the<00:06:15.309> Pirelli<00:06:15.669> tires<00:06:15.999> wear<00:06:16.389> and

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:16.649 
tires how the Pirelli tires wear and

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:18.600 
tires how the Pirelli tires wear and
everything<00:06:17.649> else<00:06:17.770> I<00:06:17.860> think<00:06:18.009> once<00:06:18.159> we<00:06:18.249> come<00:06:18.490> to

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
everything else I think once we come to

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.489 
everything else I think once we come to
Europe<00:06:18.939> and<00:06:19.089> we<00:06:19.209> know<00:06:19.360> the<00:06:19.509> races<00:06:19.870> are<00:06:19.899> or

00:06:20.489 --> 00:06:20.499 
Europe and we know the races are or

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:21.510 
Europe and we know the races are or
there's<00:06:20.680> going<00:06:20.770> to<00:06:20.860> be<00:06:20.889> quite<00:06:21.099> a<00:06:21.129> few<00:06:21.309> dry

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 
there's going to be quite a few dry

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.070 
there's going to be quite a few dry
races<00:06:21.939> when<00:06:22.059> we<00:06:22.149> come<00:06:22.300> to<00:06:22.449> Europe<00:06:22.659> for<00:06:22.689> certain

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 
races when we come to Europe for certain

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.290 
races when we come to Europe for certain
I<00:06:23.379> know<00:06:23.439> China's<00:06:23.949> can<00:06:24.430> often<00:06:24.729> be<00:06:24.849> a<00:06:24.879> little<00:06:25.149> bit

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
I know China's can often be a little bit

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.420 
I know China's can often be a little bit
of<00:06:25.389> a<00:06:25.449> wet<00:06:25.629> one<00:06:25.919> then<00:06:26.919> we're<00:06:27.099> going<00:06:27.189> to<00:06:27.279> see<00:06:27.399> a

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:27.430 
of a wet one then we're going to see a

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.980 
of a wet one then we're going to see a
bit<00:06:27.580> of<00:06:27.669> a<00:06:27.699> transformation<00:06:28.029> of<00:06:28.539> the<00:06:28.629> quickest

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 
bit of a transformation of the quickest

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.179 
bit of a transformation of the quickest
cars<00:06:29.229> and<00:06:29.469> it's<00:06:29.589> going<00:06:29.680> to<00:06:29.770> be<00:06:29.860> more<00:06:29.979> about

00:06:30.179 --> 00:06:30.189 
cars and it's going to be more about

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:32.100 
cars and it's going to be more about
tire<00:06:30.430> degradation<00:06:30.639> and<00:06:31.360> everything<00:06:31.899> else<00:06:32.050> and

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110 
tire degradation and everything else and

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:33.449 
tire degradation and everything else and
I<00:06:32.199> think<00:06:32.349> it's<00:06:32.439> going<00:06:32.499> to<00:06:32.649> be<00:06:32.709> constantly

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:33.459 
I think it's going to be constantly

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:34.980 
I think it's going to be constantly
learning<00:06:33.729> I<00:06:33.969> think<00:06:34.149> McLaren<00:06:34.539> was<00:06:34.659> certainly

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
learning I think McLaren was certainly

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.369 
learning I think McLaren was certainly
thrown<00:06:35.559> off<00:06:35.770> by<00:06:36.430> the<00:06:36.490> tire<00:06:36.909> degradation<00:06:37.379> in

00:06:38.369 --> 00:06:38.379 
thrown off by the tire degradation in

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:39.899 
thrown off by the tire degradation in
some<00:06:38.919> of<00:06:38.979> the<00:06:39.039> wet<00:06:39.159> tires<00:06:39.430> and<00:06:39.639> stuff<00:06:39.759> like

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:39.909 
some of the wet tires and stuff like

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:42.179 
some of the wet tires and stuff like
that<00:06:39.969> and<00:06:40.120> I<00:06:40.300> think<00:06:40.329> red<00:06:40.719> ball<00:06:40.930> again<00:06:41.199> don't

00:06:42.179 --> 00:06:42.189 
that and I think red ball again don't

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:43.829 
that and I think red ball again don't
count<00:06:42.339> them<00:06:42.519> out<00:06:42.669> there<00:06:42.969> every<00:06:43.329> bit<00:06:43.509> as<00:06:43.629> quick

00:06:43.829 --> 00:06:43.839 
count them out there every bit as quick

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:44.590 
count them out there every bit as quick
as<00:06:44.019> McLaren

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:44.600 
as McLaren

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.300 
as McLaren
in<00:06:44.720> race<00:06:44.930> trim<00:06:45.260> and<00:06:45.740> I<00:06:45.830> think<00:06:46.010> we're<00:06:46.130> going<00:06:46.250> to

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:46.310 
in race trim and I think we're going to

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:47.380 
in race trim and I think we're going to
be<00:06:46.400> seeing<00:06:46.550> then<00:06:46.760> come<00:06:46.940> more<00:06:47.150> to<00:06:47.300> the

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:47.390 
be seeing then come more to the

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.780 
be seeing then come more to the
championship<00:06:47.810> for<00:06:48.020> in<00:06:48.320> the<00:06:48.590> coming<00:06:48.890> races<00:06:49.310> so

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:49.790 
championship for in the coming races so

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.570 
championship for in the coming races so
that's<00:06:50.120> it<00:06:50.330> for<00:06:50.870> the<00:06:50.990> blog<00:06:51.830> of<00:06:52.070> malaysia<00:06:52.430> i

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:53.500 
that's it for the blog of malaysia i

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:53.510 
know it's taking a little bit longer

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.810
