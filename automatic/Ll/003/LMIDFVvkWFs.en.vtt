00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
$33 this was like seven bucks so I think

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.190

totally screwed up I was thinking about

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.249 
totally screwed up I was thinking about
replacing<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.270> rims<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:20.900> that<00:01:21.900> probably

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
replacing the rims and that probably

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.390 
replacing the rims and that probably
cost<00:01:22.470> hundreds<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:22.950> hundreds<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.250> dollars

cost hundreds and hundreds of dollars

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.499 
cost hundreds and hundreds of dollars
close<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.939> thousands<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:25.200> replace<00:01:25.530> these<00:01:25.710> rims

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
close to thousands to replace these rims

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
but I was doing some experimentation of

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.160 
but I was doing some experimentation of
