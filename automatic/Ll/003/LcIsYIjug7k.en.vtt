00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:04.629
 and at hamas this academic year is marked by an image we are not going 

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:07.959
 put students in mailbox in containers 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:11.539
 a residence of a hundred studios was indeed said to be proud of 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:13.120
 edge of a harbor basin 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.390
 but it's bigger than the city hall u and it's a first in France 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.529
 and the first tenants are rather not excited about the architectured and about 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.529
 the price especially the laterals she lived on stage 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:25.640
 with his mother 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.060
 alyzia go around his future home 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.170
 impressive because unusual the haddock residence as it's called 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.809
 is not a city u like the others each studio is celebrating an old 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.809
 containers 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.120
 visit of the container pays 203 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.160
 alas surprise alice discovers a studio excited it flames in nine 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.730
 cooked 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.580
 bathroom with gold day car 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.070
 to the ladle salivating its trace we do not know how 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.560
 the studio is 25 square meters instead of 18 usually mentioned 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.330
 but it is not more expensive 305 euros of rent without counting the current ones 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.780
 quoting the Haitian poet 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.080
 in the same vein 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.460
 a little morning 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.600
 ali it's one of the heroes elected the places are torn off in a few 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.710
 weeks 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.290
 400 requests for his home 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.710
 for these old containers made in China and used for transportation 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.430
 food is a second life 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.860
 the advantage of this system is that it allows to build very quickly 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.510
 place construction deadlines actually explains everything wild 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.890
 how many 6-2 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.810
 facts 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.980
 an iron discipline 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.290
 the residence cost 5 million euros 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.020
 donation of one million brought by the state for the deputy mayor the containers 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.860
 alone will not solve the problem of student housing 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.780
 but other aims will come 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.780
 I am convinced that in particular port cities 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.359
 in Bordeaux 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:10.109
 I am sure that 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:13.579
 the question to ask and by the waste it is sure that it arises 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:15.699
 also in other cities that are not lovers of cities 

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:17.969
 ports we are less used to seeing containers 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:19.970
 beyond the ranking in France 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.870
 to satisfy the demand of the students it would be necessary to build 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.950
 tens of thousands of university chambers
