 youtube and was trying to use the 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.879
 channel as a launching pad to do 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.890
 something always inherent in comedy 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.170

 demented and maybe making us laugh 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:57.980

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.620
