00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
for experienced boilers because it takes

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.880 
for experienced boilers because it takes
some<00:02:27.440> time<00:02:27.470> to<00:02:27.710> learn<00:02:28.750> how<00:02:29.750> to<00:02:29.780> actually<00:02:30.560> ride

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
some time to learn how to actually ride

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.600 
some time to learn how to actually ride
with<00:02:31.160> your<00:02:31.250> rep<00:02:31.430> stick<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:33.200> there<00:02:34.130> is<00:02:34.250> also

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
with your rep stick and there is also

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.910 
with your rep stick and there is also
the<00:02:35.180> RIP<00:02:35.450> stick<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.840> limited<00:02:36.260> edition<00:02:36.740> which

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
the RIP stick the limited edition which

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.300 
the RIP stick the limited edition which
is<00:02:37.070> very<00:02:37.640> similar<00:02:37.910> to<00:02:38.120> Britta<00:02:38.900> but<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.160> only

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
is very similar to Britta but the only

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.720 
is very similar to Britta but the only
difference<00:02:40.610> is<00:02:41.120> that<00:02:41.180> arm<00:02:41.960> it<00:02:42.740> does<00:02:43.280> not<00:02:43.490> have

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
difference is that arm it does not have

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.420 
difference is that arm it does not have
a<00:02:44.830> metal<00:02:45.830> eye<00:02:46.990> connecting<00:02:47.990> the<00:02:48.380> front<00:02:49.100> and<00:02:49.310> the

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
a metal eye connecting the front and the

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.390 
a metal eye connecting the front and the
back<00:02:49.720> but<00:02:50.720> instead<00:02:51.170> it<00:02:51.380> is<00:02:51.560> a<00:02:51.590> rubber<00:02:52.100> handle

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
back but instead it is a rubber handle

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.150 
back but instead it is a rubber handle
so<00:02:53.030> you<00:02:53.630> can<00:02:53.690> grind<00:02:54.200> it<00:02:54.410> and<00:02:54.650> it's<00:02:54.800> a<00:02:54.950> bit<00:02:55.130> more

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
so you can grind it and it's a bit more

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.240 
so you can grind it and it's a bit more
expensive<00:02:55.700> because<00:02:56.209> there<00:02:56.690> are<00:02:57.250> limited

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
expensive because there are limited

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.170 
expensive because there are limited
