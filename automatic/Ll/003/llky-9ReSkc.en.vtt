00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
protein now this does taste really good

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.350

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
and the macros are pretty nice but the

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.179 
and the macros are pretty nice but the
issue<00:01:36.540> for<00:01:36.840> me<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.439> usually<00:01:37.619> eat<00:01:37.890> Greek

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
issue for me is I usually eat Greek

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.280 
issue for me is I usually eat Greek
yogurt<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.640> help<00:01:38.970> boost<00:01:39.180> my<00:01:39.420> protein<00:01:39.900> intake

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
yogurt to help boost my protein intake

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.069 
yogurt to help boost my protein intake
and<00:01:40.619> there<00:01:41.430> are<00:01:41.610> actually<00:01:42.150> more<00:01:42.329> carbs<00:01:42.810> of

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
and there are actually more carbs of

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.170 
and there are actually more carbs of
protein<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.680> this<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.159> that's<00:01:44.850> okay<00:01:45.149> if

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
protein in this and that's okay if

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.960 
protein in this and that's okay if
you're<00:01:45.479> 34<00:01:46.079> but<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.590> tend<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.310> like<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.700> eat<00:01:47.820> my

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
you're 34 but I tend to like to eat my

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.020 
you're 34 but I tend to like to eat my
carbs<00:01:48.329> elsewhere<00:01:48.979> so<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.159> can<00:01:50.369> be<00:01:50.520> kind<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:50.939> a

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
carbs elsewhere so this can be kind of a

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.319 
carbs elsewhere so this can be kind of a
bit<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.329> problem<00:01:51.570> for<00:01:51.869> me<00:01:52.130> so<00:01:53.130> what<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.030> found

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
bit of a problem for me so what I found

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.630 
bit of a problem for me so what I found
the<00:01:54.450> other<00:01:54.600> day<00:01:54.689> was<00:01:55.170> Danone<00:01:55.920> written<00:01:56.460> my

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
the other day was Danone written my

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.480 
the other day was Danone written my
Greek<00:01:57.570> yogurt<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.710> hopefully<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.310> guys<00:01:59.430> can

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490

see this here I'm gonna try to adjust

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.060 
see this here I'm gonna try to adjust
this<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.430> can<00:02:02.640> actually

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
this you can actually

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.300 
this you can actually
see<00:02:03.880> what<00:02:04.060> we<00:02:04.150> got<00:02:04.210> going<00:02:04.330> on<00:02:04.720> as<00:02:05.650> you<00:02:05.890> can<00:02:06.070> see

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
see what we got going on as you can see

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.700 
see what we got going on as you can see
one<00:02:06.640> servings<00:02:07.180> a<00:02:07.300> little<00:02:07.660> bit<00:02:07.810> less<00:02:08.020> than<00:02:08.320> six

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
one servings a little bit less than six

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.090 
one servings a little bit less than six
ounces<00:02:09.250> there's<00:02:10.000> 80<00:02:10.330> calories<00:02:10.630> zero<00:02:11.200> grams<00:02:11.890> of

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
ounces there's 80 calories zero grams of

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.670 
ounces there's 80 calories zero grams of
fat<00:02:12.340> eight<00:02:12.730> grams<00:02:13.090> of<00:02:13.300> carbs<00:02:13.720> and<00:02:13.930> 12<00:02:14.230> grams<00:02:14.470> of

fat eight grams of carbs and 12 grams of

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.610 
fat eight grams of carbs and 12 grams of
protein<00:02:15.270> so<00:02:16.270> for<00:02:16.600> almost<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:16.990> same<00:02:17.080> amount<00:02:17.500> of

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
protein so for almost the same amount of

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.670 
protein so for almost the same amount of
volume<00:02:17.820> you<00:02:18.820> actually<00:02:19.270> have<00:02:19.480> 60<00:02:20.440> calories

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
volume you actually have 60 calories

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.460 
volume you actually have 60 calories
less<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:21.670> there's<00:02:22.030> also<00:02:22.300> four<00:02:22.780> grams<00:02:23.080> more

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
less and there's also four grams more

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.270 
less and there's also four grams more
crazy<00:02:23.860> than<00:02:24.040> there<00:02:24.430> is<00:02:24.610> carbs<00:02:25.450> so<00:02:26.280> basically

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
crazy than there is carbs so basically

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.220 
crazy than there is carbs so basically

the Dan and Greek yogurt helps get you
up<00:02:29.380> closer<00:02:29.680> your<00:02:30.010> protein<00:02:30.600> without<00:02:31.600> bumping

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
up closer your protein without bumping

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.100 
up closer your protein without bumping
your<00:02:32.440> carb<00:02:32.710> and<00:02:32.920> take<00:02:33.100> up<00:02:33.280> too<00:02:33.460> much<00:02:33.510> so<00:02:34.510> that's

all<00:02:35.350> I<00:02:35.380> plan<00:02:35.770> on<00:02:35.800> making<00:02:36.310> these<00:02:36.459> videos<00:02:36.880> I

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
all I plan on making these videos I

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.820 
all I plan on making these videos I
basically<00:02:37.570> just<00:02:37.660> want<00:02:38.020> to<00:02:38.110> quickly<00:02:38.320> compare

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
basically just want to quickly compare

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.680 
basically just want to quickly compare
two<00:02:39.040> products<00:02:39.520> and<00:02:39.760> make<00:02:39.910> suggestions<00:02:40.390> for

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
two products and make suggestions for

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.530 
two products and make suggestions for
you<00:02:40.870> guys<00:02:41.050> to<00:02:41.260> make<00:02:41.380> things<00:02:41.680> easier<00:02:42.220> so<00:02:43.030> to<00:02:43.120> sum

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
you guys to make things easier so to sum

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.890 
you guys to make things easier so to sum
up<00:02:43.570> this<00:02:43.840> video<00:02:44.290> eat<00:02:44.980> that's<00:02:45.330> not<00:02:46.330> that<00:02:46.570> and

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
up this video eat that's not that and

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.570 
up this video eat that's not that and
you<00:02:47.500> lose<00:02:47.740> the<00:02:47.920> fat<00:02:48.300> see<00:02:49.300> you<00:02:49.390> guys<00:02:49.540> later
