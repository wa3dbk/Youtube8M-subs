00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:31.279
 whittier here in the trap 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.430

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.940
 our train derailed he was going too 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.039
 quickly in a bend 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:04.570

 why are you watching me like that I 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.409
 look like this for two reasons the 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.789
 first is because apparently you 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.789
 are the only survivor of this accident 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.390
 and the second is because you 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.390
 have no scratches 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:38.500
 I know what you think you are looking for 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.369
 an explanation to all this what is sure 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.229
 it's just one hundred and thirty-one people 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.700
 have died so that you can 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.630
 finally understand what was your 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.840
 destiny are you ready to hear the 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.840
