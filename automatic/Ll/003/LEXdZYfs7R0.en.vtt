00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.170 

forming<00:03:11.140> into<00:03:11.319> some<00:03:11.680> kind<00:03:11.920> of<00:03:12.010> pattern<00:03:12.250> so

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
forming into some kind of pattern so

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.520 
forming into some kind of pattern so
maybe<00:03:13.989> just<00:03:14.580> maybe<00:03:15.580> our<00:03:16.180> cookie<00:03:17.080> will<00:03:17.260> turn

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
maybe just maybe our cookie will turn
