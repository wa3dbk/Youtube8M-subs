00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 some to all and this moment with novo 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.490
 and of card 5 in this case we are with a 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.540
 new career playing with subscribers and 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.309
 let's see if we can win this 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.440
 race with the cobra because it's a 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.570
 parkour and the cobra must be given 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.540
 ok the parkour yes or yes so let's 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.460
 see for now we left very very bad but 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.949
 well here one that says it is in favor to 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:25.080
 it bothered him so the strip there is worth 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.849
 eye eye with this software that yes 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.010
 goes a lot but good the charge what 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.330
 control, control, look, look, look 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.270
 Look look look we're here 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.980
 the removes of the first careful care 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.219
 Care, okay, okay, mom, I see it. 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.210
 pulls the whole time we seem 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.309
 that is fine all the time and 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.200
 we choose the jump over here let's charge 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.780
 now we advance to one we put them 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.120
 eye, here I spent a 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.180
 little but the cobra says he has the 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.760
 tactic 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.130
 the tactic comes around here we are 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.540
 we follow rooms we have nothing the 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:05.850
 third yes we can still overtake 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:09.310
 eye, I've spent a lot of time besides 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.600
 it also seems first first teams 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.370
 of first sectors and first for 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.780
 we almost can not be for the 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.490
 second not the first one goes to one that is 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.009
 going up already 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.850
 sixth this here and not let it be 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:23.909
 a little more 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.580
 and there we have it and we have it we have the 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.240
 point this one that is the first one we are going to 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.970
 throw us a little back and you have to 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.460
 jump to the team that I think around here 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.070
 ok I think we go first do not tell me 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.320
 I think uncle we were there, kid 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.700
 we were there I think it has not happened 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.700
 nobody ahead or at the moment 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.700
 often fail what yes there is one up 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.980
 I think that there is one up we go to 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.290
 see why we had victory there in 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.490
 seriously could they have attacked 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.340
 surely here 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.480
 and we had in the middle win not me what 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.240
 I think 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:08.340
 what face that damn fail seriously 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.129
 steffen or let's tackle all the time 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.810
 there we have it Balearic and now yes with 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.640
 Be careful what I do not know is how I stay 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.970
 there I do not understand 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.910
 this race would have been crazy 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:26.260
 if we had not passed even one worth it 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:29.080
 we have I think I'm going second actually 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.079
 I'm not very sure but I think I'm going 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.420
 second, it's worth coming here, yes , 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:37.270
 look second second right now 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.470
 eye you have to come here my mother 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.470
 how is the edited point to the 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.480
 left do not come man you have to go more 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.970
 fast you have to go faster actually 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.860
 I do not know if I go second first 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.450
 what I'm sure 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.450
 voucher tour tour 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.500
 already we would have changed the position 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.500
 when we take this 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.840
 fast because 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.190
 ok it goes well that's the charge we're going 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.060
 come on let's go for the first 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.950
 position let's go for the first position 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:18.600
 quickly we quickly go for the 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:21.180
 first ok look around here now they are going to 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.330
 see if he had attacked here is going 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.330
 First 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.490
 requirements so you have to say that it is 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.410
 playing very well the cobra although not 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.970
 let's go first but my mother is 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.580
 going well childbirth and do not know how 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.110
 first the first I do not know where it is in 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.900
 reality 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:42.580
 I do not know where it is because I see one that is 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.580
 very far but I do not think it's that 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:49.069
 we adapt we imagine that we are 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.069
 here 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.099
 putting up 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.970
 and keeps putting on I'm freaking 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:01.439
 freaking out so much it's impossible that you do not get 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:06.069
 my mother 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:09.819
 same as you see it ends every first 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.709
 very close is the third is the third 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.160
 so you have to do everything perfect or 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.930
 do not win 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.900
 you have to do everything perfect effect 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.030
 come on let's go cobra 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.580
 to arrive seconds has been very good 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.800
 calculation is fine 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.690
 let's go let's go the truth is that not much 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.730
 yes to make the failure fairly quickly 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.530
 been the first time seriously if that does not 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.120
 we would have failed because we have already 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.230
 had I think that practically the 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.350
 victory because then we have not 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:38.930
 attacked so much more we got seconds 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.730
 let's charge madryn already as side 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.040
 Esteban Curen would be purple a lot 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.720
 parkour with the cobra as there is always 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.090
 to always take the cobra because it's the 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.040
 I won, so I like it very much 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.210
 this parkour as I tell the truth I hope 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.830
 that you have liked used already 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.790
 you know what have you raised me and my twitter 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.160
 the description to play with me 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.450
 because you already know that for 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.890
 play races with my only one that you have 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.420
 What to do is follow me on twitter 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.460
 invited through twitter as he invited 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.870
 notice when I'm going to play on twitter 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.030
 I say well in ten minutes we started 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.200
 I put the tweet on twitter and already 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.330
 just what you have to do is 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.990
 follow me in the crew and play with me like that 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.340
 that nothing I hope you liked 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.720
 I would greatly appreciate it if the 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.160
 video its less crazy christ 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.160
 none of 97 goodbye
