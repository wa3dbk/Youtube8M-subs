okay<00:00:02.070> we're<00:00:02.370> back<00:00:02.399> autodesk<00:00:03.360> inventor<00:00:03.629> LT

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:04.310 
okay we're back autodesk inventor LT

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:11.049 
okay we're back autodesk inventor LT
2010<00:00:05.330> let's<00:00:06.330> put<00:00:07.319> it<00:00:07.410> through<00:00:07.529> its<00:00:07.589> paces<00:00:09.170> okay

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:11.059 
2010 let's put it through its paces okay

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:13.400 
2010 let's put it through its paces okay
limited<00:00:12.059> technology<00:00:12.420> let's<00:00:13.049> see<00:00:13.200> if<00:00:13.290> it's

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
limited technology let's see if it's

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.400 
limited technology let's see if it's
limited<00:00:13.969> okay<00:00:14.969> constraints<00:00:15.660> pretty<00:00:16.020> much<00:00:16.199> the

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
limited okay constraints pretty much the

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.660 
limited okay constraints pretty much the
same<00:00:16.650> yeah<00:00:17.520> they<00:00:17.760> look<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.090> same<00:00:18.170> dialog<00:00:19.170> box

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
same yeah they look the same dialog box

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:26.029 
same yeah they look the same dialog box
ribbon<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:21.480> same<00:00:22.519> okay<00:00:23.519> sure<00:00:24.029> thing<00:00:24.529> let<00:00:25.529> some

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
ribbon the same okay sure thing let some

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.750 
ribbon the same okay sure thing let some
add<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.550> couple<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.769> dimensions<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:29.070> think<00:00:29.670> I'm

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
add a couple of dimensions I think I'm

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.139 
add a couple of dimensions I think I'm
going<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.939> build<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.420> wheel<00:00:30.720> assembly<00:00:31.349> Oh

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
going to build a wheel assembly Oh

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.639 
going to build a wheel assembly Oh
assemblies<00:00:33.149> somebody<00:00:33.989> told<00:00:34.140> me<00:00:34.230> they<00:00:34.380> can't

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
assemblies somebody told me they can't

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.010 
assemblies somebody told me they can't
do<00:00:34.770> assemblies<00:00:35.309> in<00:00:35.520> LT<00:00:36.239> let's<00:00:36.570> take<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.809> look

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
do assemblies in LT let's take a look

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.049 
do assemblies in LT let's take a look
see<00:00:37.380> if<00:00:37.410> that's<00:00:37.649> true<00:00:38.510> okay<00:00:39.510> um<00:00:40.940> we're<00:00:41.940> going

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
see if that's true okay um we're going

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.229 
see if that's true okay um we're going
to<00:00:42.120> revolve<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:42.989> this<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.950> profile<00:00:44.520> or

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
to revolve this so this is a profile or

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.819 
to revolve this so this is a profile or
section<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.260> half<00:00:46.950> section<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.550> wheel

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
section of a half section of the wheel

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.520 
section of a half section of the wheel
high<00:00:49.829> dimensions<00:00:50.820> yep<00:00:51.210> same<00:00:51.660> we<00:00:52.140> can<00:00:52.289> add

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
high dimensions yep same we can add

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.689 
high dimensions yep same we can add
units<00:00:53.480> inches<00:00:54.480> feet<00:00:55.250> centimeters<00:00:56.250> meters

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
units inches feet centimeters meters

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.880 
units inches feet centimeters meters
whatever<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.390> needed<00:00:57.660> yes<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.379> can<00:00:58.410> make

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
whatever is needed yes you can make

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.000 
whatever is needed yes you can make
dimensions<00:00:59.640> equal<00:01:00.090> we<00:01:00.870> have<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.289> cube<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:01.890> we

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
dimensions equal we have the cube so we

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.789 
dimensions equal we have the cube so we
can<00:01:02.160> rotate<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.940> what's<00:01:03.120> revolve<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:03.930> have

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
can rotate and what's revolve this have

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.960 
can rotate and what's revolve this have
aliases<00:01:05.840> absolutely<00:01:06.840> set<00:01:07.110> up<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.350> same<00:01:07.530> way

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
aliases absolutely set up the same way

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.609 
aliases absolutely set up the same way
now<00:01:08.970> let's<00:01:09.240> do<00:01:09.360> an<00:01:09.479> outside<00:01:09.869> fill<00:01:10.170> at<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.350> point

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
now let's do an outside fill at a point

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.230 
now let's do an outside fill at a point
1<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.430> inside<00:01:11.939> Phil<00:01:12.630> it's<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.990> point<00:01:13.320> 5<00:01:13.619> and

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
1 and the inside Phil it's a point 5 and

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.200 
1 and the inside Phil it's a point 5 and
this<00:01:15.240> wheel<00:01:15.509> starts<00:01:15.990> coming<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.500> life<00:01:16.710> and

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
this wheel starts coming to life and

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.969 
this wheel starts coming to life and
let's<00:01:18.210> take<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.570> look<00:01:18.869> at<00:01:19.049> again<00:01:19.380> looks<00:01:19.710> good

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
let's take a look at again looks good

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.749 
let's take a look at again looks good
let's<00:01:20.729> do<00:01:21.210> we<00:01:21.299> buy<00:01:21.450> properties<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.759> promise

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
let's do we buy properties I promise

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.890 
let's do we buy properties I promise
yeah<00:01:24.299> 3<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.740> we<00:01:26.250> can<00:01:26.430> assign<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.850> material<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.720> it

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
yeah 3 so we can assign a material to it

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.350 
yeah 3 so we can assign a material to it
and<00:01:28.020> once<00:01:28.200> we<00:01:28.409> do<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.619> we<00:01:29.130> have<00:01:29.460> mass<00:01:29.850> in<00:01:30.180> the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
and once we do that we have mass in the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.719 
and once we do that we have mass in the
area<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.810> volume<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.560> we<00:01:32.250> can<00:01:32.400> do<00:01:32.520> some

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
area and the volume and we can do some

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.319 
area and the volume and we can do some
analysis<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.710> yep<00:01:34.710> got<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:36.030> can<00:01:36.210> now

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
analysis and yep got it you can now

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.569 
analysis and yep got it you can now
colorize<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.070> looks<00:01:38.220> real

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
colorize it so that it looks real

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.370 
colorize it so that it looks real
nothing<00:01:39.000> better<00:01:39.210> than<00:01:39.420> working<00:01:39.720> on<00:01:39.990> parts

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
nothing better than working on parts

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.490 
nothing better than working on parts
that<00:01:40.590> look<00:01:40.619> like<00:01:41.100> there<00:01:41.340> really<00:01:41.610> are<00:01:41.880> BOTS<00:01:42.500> so

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
that look like there really are BOTS so

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.679 
that look like there really are BOTS so
here's<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.829> hard<00:01:43.979> one<00:01:44.240> can<00:01:45.240> we<00:01:45.390> create<00:01:45.600> a

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
here's the hard one can we create a

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.440 
here's the hard one can we create a
bushing<00:01:46.220> if<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.399> was<00:01:47.579> straight<00:01:47.909> inventor<00:01:48.420> I

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
bushing if it was straight inventor I

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.090 
bushing if it was straight inventor I
would<00:01:48.810> create<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.079> new<00:01:49.200> part<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.799> go<00:01:49.920> from

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
would create a new part and go from

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.539 
would create a new part and go from
there<00:01:50.369> but<00:01:50.670> here<00:01:51.530> we've<00:01:52.530> got<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.829> create<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.369> as

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
there but here we've got to create it as

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.130 
there but here we've got to create it as
a<00:01:54.920> second<00:01:55.920> solid<00:01:56.399> body<00:01:56.640> that's<00:01:57.390> kind<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:57.899> neat

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
a second solid body that's kind of neat

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.980 
a second solid body that's kind of neat
that<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.219> what<00:01:59.430> we<00:01:59.549> inherited<00:02:00.000> from<00:02:00.030> inventor

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
that is what we inherited from inventor

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.980 
that is what we inherited from inventor
2010<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.770> ability<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.490> create<00:02:02.990> multiple

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
2010 the ability to create multiple

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.709 
2010 the ability to create multiple
solid<00:02:04.619> bodies<00:02:05.009> within<00:02:05.250> an<00:02:05.490> individual<00:02:06.060> single

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
solid bodies within an individual single

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.170 
solid bodies within an individual single
part<00:02:07.049> so<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:07.829> we<00:02:08.340> now<00:02:08.580> can<00:02:08.910> simulate<00:02:09.330> a

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
part so that we now can simulate a

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.199 
part so that we now can simulate a
second<00:02:11.569> part<00:02:11.840> even<00:02:12.349> though<00:02:12.560> it's<00:02:12.829> not<00:02:13.159> so<00:02:13.849> yeah

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
second part even though it's not so yeah

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.170 
second part even though it's not so yeah
I<00:02:14.239> am<00:02:14.569> simulating<00:02:14.989> an<00:02:15.609> assembly<00:02:16.609> even<00:02:17.060> though

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
I am simulating an assembly even though

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.220 
I am simulating an assembly even though
it's<00:02:17.359> not<00:02:17.659> an<00:02:17.840> assembly<00:02:18.379> and<00:02:19.900> for<00:02:20.900> this<00:02:20.989> to

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
it's not an assembly and for this to

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.080 
it's not an assembly and for this to
make<00:02:21.379> look<00:02:21.739> more<00:02:22.129> real<00:02:22.459> I'm<00:02:22.790> going<00:02:23.030> to

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
make look more real I'm going to

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.949 
make look more real I'm going to
colorize<00:02:23.390> it<00:02:23.569> so<00:02:24.140> that<00:02:24.530> it<00:02:24.890> stands<00:02:25.849> out<00:02:26.180> so

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
colorize it so that it stands out so

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.140 
colorize it so that it stands out so
someone<00:02:27.769> can<00:02:27.920> say<00:02:28.219> can't<00:02:28.670> say<00:02:29.019> look<00:02:30.019> real<00:02:30.260> and

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
someone can say can't say look real and

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.199 
someone can say can't say look real and
will<00:02:32.150> either<00:02:32.689> mirror<00:02:33.200> it<00:02:33.349> across<00:02:33.739> the<00:02:34.489> center

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
will either mirror it across the center

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.449 
will either mirror it across the center
of<00:02:35.239> the<00:02:35.840> wheel<00:02:36.439> or<00:02:37.599> we'll<00:02:38.599> just<00:02:38.870> do<00:02:39.049> it<00:02:39.079> again

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
of the wheel or we'll just do it again

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.709 
of the wheel or we'll just do it again
same<00:02:40.459> thing<00:02:40.639> we<00:02:40.730> did<00:02:40.849> the<00:02:40.969> first<00:02:41.000> time<00:02:41.269> good

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:41.719 
same thing we did the first time good

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:44.170 
same thing we did the first time good
practices<00:02:42.319> they<00:02:42.469> always<00:02:42.650> say<00:02:42.909> try<00:02:43.909> it<00:02:43.970> a

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
practices they always say try it a

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.659 
practices they always say try it a
second<00:02:44.629> time<00:02:44.659> you<00:02:45.290> don't<00:02:45.470> forget<00:02:45.919> it<00:02:46.090> okay<00:02:47.349> so

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:48.669 
second time you don't forget it okay so

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:51.369 
second time you don't forget it okay so
for<00:02:49.669> all<00:02:49.760> intensive<00:02:50.090> purposes<00:02:50.299> this<00:02:51.169> is<00:02:51.319> a

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
for all intensive purposes this is a

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.550 
for all intensive purposes this is a
wheel<00:02:51.650> with<00:02:52.250> a<00:02:52.519> bushing<00:02:53.480> let's<00:02:54.290> create<00:02:54.470> a

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
wheel with a bushing let's create a

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.129 
wheel with a bushing let's create a
couple<00:02:54.829> of<00:02:54.919> drawings<00:02:56.290> DWG<00:02:57.290> idw<00:02:58.219> same<00:02:58.939> as<00:02:59.209> we

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:00.139 
couple of drawings DWG idw same as we

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:03.759 
couple of drawings DWG idw same as we
can<00:03:00.439> place<00:03:01.129> a<00:03:01.159> base<00:03:01.639> view<00:03:02.090> we<00:03:02.569> can<00:03:02.599> project<00:03:03.230> the

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
can place a base view we can project the

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.240 
can place a base view we can project the
view<00:03:04.010> we<00:03:04.280> can<00:03:04.489> create<00:03:04.879> sections<00:03:05.359> of<00:03:05.959> that<00:03:06.919> and

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
view we can create sections of that and

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.670 
view we can create sections of that and
then<00:03:07.939> we<00:03:08.180> can<00:03:08.359> create<00:03:08.599> an<00:03:08.689> isometric<00:03:09.379> of<00:03:09.560> the

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
then we can create an isometric of the

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.069 
then we can create an isometric of the
section<00:03:10.219> kind<00:03:10.879> of<00:03:10.969> neat<00:03:11.150> we<00:03:11.599> can<00:03:11.719> also<00:03:11.870> do

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
section kind of neat we can also do

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.949 
section kind of neat we can also do
details<00:03:12.590> and<00:03:12.889> no<00:03:13.879> one<00:03:14.060> can<00:03:14.239> say<00:03:14.389> that<00:03:14.419> doesn't

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
details and no one can say that doesn't

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.369 
details and no one can say that doesn't
like<00:03:15.199> a<00:03:15.229> push<00:03:15.530> now<00:03:15.949> it's<00:03:16.459> a<00:03:16.549> separate<00:03:17.000> time

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379 
like a push now it's a separate time

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:19.719 
like a push now it's a separate time
great<00:03:18.379> let's<00:03:18.650> go<00:03:18.769> back<00:03:18.919> to<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.129> model<00:03:19.489> see<00:03:19.669> if

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:19.729 
great let's go back to the model see if

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:21.550 
great let's go back to the model see if
we<00:03:19.849> can<00:03:20.030> shell<00:03:20.510> the<00:03:20.750> wheel<00:03:20.959> it's<00:03:21.229> a<00:03:21.319> hollow

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
we can shell the wheel it's a hollow

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.759 
we can shell the wheel it's a hollow
wheel<00:03:21.859> you<00:03:22.849> act<00:03:23.120> great<00:03:23.720> new<00:03:24.019> tools<00:03:24.379> we<00:03:24.739> can

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
wheel you act great new tools we can

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.319 
wheel you act great new tools we can
shell<00:03:25.400> a<00:03:25.930> single<00:03:26.930> solid<00:03:27.500> body<00:03:27.769> so<00:03:28.699> that<00:03:28.729> the

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
shell a single solid body so that the

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.710 
shell a single solid body so that the
wheel<00:03:29.810> will<00:03:30.489> shell<00:03:31.489> without<00:03:31.819> the<00:03:32.299> bushing

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
wheel will shell without the bushing

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.939 
wheel will shell without the bushing
being<00:03:33.199> affected<00:03:34.479> okay<00:03:35.479> let's<00:03:36.470> see<00:03:36.650> if<00:03:36.680> we<00:03:36.799> can

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:36.949 
being affected okay let's see if we can

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:40.749 
being affected okay let's see if we can
create<00:03:37.069> a<00:03:37.159> bolt<00:03:37.840> more<00:03:38.840> interesting<00:03:39.549> can<00:03:40.549> we

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:40.759 
create a bolt more interesting can we

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:43.960 
create a bolt more interesting can we
yes<00:03:41.479> well<00:03:42.019> let's<00:03:42.349> create<00:03:42.739> a<00:03:42.919> section<00:03:43.519> through

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
yes well let's create a section through

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.599 
yes well let's create a section through
the<00:03:44.180> wheel<00:03:44.419> it's<00:03:45.349> a<00:03:45.439> cut<00:03:45.709> section<00:03:46.370> will

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
the wheel it's a cut section will

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:50.759 
the wheel it's a cut section will
project<00:03:46.849> cut<00:03:47.419> sections<00:03:47.959> so<00:03:48.139> that<00:03:48.169> is<00:03:48.560> the<00:03:48.709> same

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
project cut sections so that is the same

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.699 
project cut sections so that is the same
this<00:03:51.769> looks<00:03:52.040> great<00:03:52.549> okay<00:03:53.509> let's<00:03:54.109> go<00:03:54.290> ahead<00:03:54.409> and

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
this looks great okay let's go ahead and

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.920 
this looks great okay let's go ahead and
build<00:03:55.370> that<00:03:55.639> um<00:03:56.979> bolt<00:03:57.979> okay<00:03:58.549> or<00:03:58.790> pushing<00:03:59.780> or

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
build that um bolt okay or pushing or

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.530 
build that um bolt okay or pushing or
whatever<00:04:00.319> we<00:04:00.560> need<00:04:00.799> to<00:04:01.009> build<00:04:01.250> okay<00:04:01.729> pretty

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
whatever we need to build okay pretty

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.599 
whatever we need to build okay pretty
much<00:04:02.780> creating<00:04:03.709> a<00:04:03.829> part<00:04:04.159> sketch<00:04:05.349> within<00:04:06.609> the

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:07.609 
much creating a part sketch within the

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:12.640 
much creating a part sketch within the
section<00:04:09.669> mention<00:04:10.669> it<00:04:10.790> again<00:04:11.689> every

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
section mention it again every

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:13.460 
section mention it again every
everything

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
everything

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.460 
everything
very<00:04:14.470> very<00:04:14.770> similar<00:04:15.130> almost<00:04:15.640> identical<00:04:16.470> don't

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
very very similar almost identical don't

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.030 
very very similar almost identical don't
see<00:04:17.680> much<00:04:17.829> difference<00:04:19.560> ok<00:04:20.560> we're<00:04:20.829> going<00:04:20.950> to

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
see much difference ok we're going to

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:27.000 
see much difference ok we're going to
revolve<00:04:21.340> that<00:04:21.960> um<00:04:23.100> and<00:04:25.410> finally<00:04:26.410> have<00:04:26.620> a<00:04:26.650> bolt

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
revolve that um and finally have a bolt

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.630 
revolve that um and finally have a bolt
when<00:04:27.310> we're<00:04:27.460> done<00:04:27.610> okay<00:04:28.860> another<00:04:29.860> solid

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
when we're done okay another solid

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.690 
when we're done okay another solid
single<00:04:31.270> body<00:04:31.860> so<00:04:32.860> we<00:04:33.010> have<00:04:33.130> three<00:04:33.430> solid

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
single body so we have three solid

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.540 
single body so we have three solid
bodies<00:04:34.210> within<00:04:34.510> this<00:04:34.870> wheel<00:04:35.170> and<00:04:35.470> if<00:04:36.100> we<00:04:36.250> start

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
bodies within this wheel and if we start

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.460 
bodies within this wheel and if we start
filling<00:04:37.150> it<00:04:37.270> to<00:04:37.420> make<00:04:37.570> it<00:04:37.600> look<00:04:37.870> real<00:04:38.200> and

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
filling it to make it look real and

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.210 
filling it to make it look real and
let's<00:04:39.100> add<00:04:39.250> a<00:04:39.370> thread<00:04:39.970> to<00:04:40.240> the<00:04:40.360> other<00:04:40.540> side

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
let's add a thread to the other side

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.880 
let's add a thread to the other side
okay<00:04:42.240> no<00:04:43.240> one's<00:04:43.450> the<00:04:43.600> wiser<00:04:43.630> looks<00:04:44.590> real<00:04:44.860> good

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
okay no one's the wiser looks real good

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.240 
okay no one's the wiser looks real good
let's<00:04:45.490> color<00:04:45.790> eyes<00:04:46.030> bolt<00:04:46.620> so<00:04:47.620> that<00:04:47.919> it<00:04:48.040> just

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
let's color eyes bolt so that it just

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.909 
let's color eyes bolt so that it just
stands<00:04:48.550> out<00:04:48.850> and<00:04:49.210> then<00:04:49.810> let's<00:04:50.050> turn<00:04:50.530> off<00:04:50.740> the

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
stands out and then let's turn off the

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.740 
stands out and then let's turn off the
work<00:04:51.130> planes<00:04:51.490> and<00:04:51.760> go<00:04:51.850> back<00:04:52.090> to<00:04:52.300> the<00:04:52.450> 2d

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
work planes and go back to the 2d

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.200 
work planes and go back to the 2d
drawing<00:04:53.200> and<00:04:53.350> see<00:04:53.950> exactly<00:04:54.100> what<00:04:54.790> might<00:04:55.030> have
