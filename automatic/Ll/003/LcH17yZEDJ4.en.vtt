just clicked low render button here um
you<00:00:26.250> got<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.790> smaller<00:00:27.270> pieces<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.500> also

computer you're going to go to mograph
cloner<00:01:03.290> gonna<00:01:04.290> drag<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.559> fear<00:01:04.979> under<00:01:05.339> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
cloner gonna drag this fear under the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.420 
cloner gonna drag this fear under the
cloner<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.090> becomes<00:01:06.329> a<00:01:06.509> child<00:01:07.430> you're

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
cloner so it becomes a child you're

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.160 
cloner so it becomes a child you're
going<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.670> change<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.299> cloner<00:01:09.570> object

going to change the cloner object

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.520 
going to change the cloner object
returns<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.799> mode<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.009> grid<00:01:11.429> array<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.530> then

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
returns the mode to grid array and then

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.730 
returns the mode to grid array and then
as<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.369> can<00:01:14.520> see<00:01:14.729> if<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.090> just<00:01:15.359> make<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> med<00:01:16.560> ball

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
as you can see if I just make a med ball

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.879 
as you can see if I just make a med ball
object<00:01:17.219> really<00:01:17.520> quick<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.499> make<00:01:19.499> the<00:01:19.679> cloner

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:19.889 
object really quick and make the cloner

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:21.949 
object really quick and make the cloner
child<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.609> can<00:01:20.759> see<00:01:20.969> it<00:01:21.119> starts<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.630> take

00:01:21.949 --> 00:01:21.959 
child you can see it starts to take

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:25.249 
child you can see it starts to take
shape<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.609> we<00:01:23.609> put<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.029> editor<00:01:24.630> subdivision

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
shape and we put the editor subdivision

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.269 
shape and we put the editor subdivision
to<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:26.359> render<00:01:27.359> subdivision<00:01:27.959> 22<00:01:28.289> and<00:01:29.039> you<00:01:29.130> can

00:01:29.269 --> 00:01:29.279 
to to render subdivision 22 and you can

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:30.980 
to to render subdivision 22 and you can
see<00:01:29.429> it<00:01:29.549> starts<00:01:29.850> getting<00:01:29.999> all<00:01:30.299> different

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
just drag it in here we're going to go

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.860 
just drag it in here we're going to go
to<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.459> random<00:02:28.940> we're<00:02:29.180> going<00:02:29.330> to<00:02:29.390> turn<00:02:29.720> on

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
to the random we're going to turn on

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.740 
scale we're going to turn on uniform
scale<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:32.120> we're<00:02:32.209> going<00:02:32.330> to<00:02:32.360> put<00:02:32.510> this<00:02:32.630> to<00:02:32.840> one

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
scale and we're going to put this to one

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.540 
scale and we're going to put this to one
and<00:02:35.750> what<00:02:35.930> that<00:02:36.110> does<00:02:36.290> is<00:02:36.349> it<00:02:36.530> changes<00:02:37.370> the

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
and what that does is it changes the

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.850 
and what that does is it changes the
different<00:02:37.910> sizes<00:02:38.420> so<00:02:38.630> if<00:02:39.260> we<00:02:39.380> come<00:02:39.560> back<00:02:39.709> to

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
different sizes so if we come back to

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.290 
different sizes so if we come back to
the<00:02:39.890> metal<00:02:40.160> ball<00:02:40.340> we<00:02:40.489> can<00:02:40.640> put<00:02:40.790> this<00:02:40.970> towards

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
the metal ball we can put this towards

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.130 
the metal ball we can put this towards
250<00:02:42.050> and<00:02:42.760> you<00:02:43.760> really<00:02:44.090> have<00:02:44.269> the<00:02:44.510> small<00:02:44.900> ones

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
250 and you really have the small ones

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.180 
250 and you really have the small ones
now<00:02:45.380> and<00:02:45.459> it<00:02:46.459> looks<00:02:46.640> really<00:02:46.730> nice<00:02:47.150> um<00:02:47.980> you<00:02:48.980> can

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
now and it looks really nice um you can

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.550 
now and it looks really nice um you can
also<00:02:49.340> play<00:02:50.330> with<00:02:50.360> this<00:02:50.780> a<00:02:50.840> little<00:02:51.080> bit<00:02:51.319> further

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
also play with this a little bit further

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.420 
also play with this a little bit further
with<00:02:51.920> your<00:02:52.130> x<00:02:52.280> and<00:02:52.489> y<00:02:52.580> positions<00:02:53.950> so<00:02:54.950> it's

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
with your x and y positions so it's

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.979 
with your x and y positions so it's
really<00:02:55.610> up<00:02:55.730> to<00:02:55.940> you<00:02:56.030> guys<00:02:56.090> depends<00:02:56.810> on<00:02:56.900> how

really up to you guys depends on how

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.690 
really up to you guys depends on how
much<00:02:57.200> your<00:02:57.440> computer<00:02:57.830> can<00:02:57.980> handle<00:02:58.010> and<00:02:58.580> all

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
much your computer can handle and all

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.960 
much your computer can handle and all
that<00:02:58.910> fun<00:02:59.120> stuff<00:02:59.709> but<00:03:00.709> um<00:03:00.890> this<00:03:01.310> is<00:03:01.519> my<00:03:01.549> metal

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
that fun stuff but um this is my metal

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.660 
that fun stuff but um this is my metal
ball<00:03:02.120> um<00:03:02.530> like<00:03:03.530> I<00:03:03.560> said<00:03:03.680> if<00:03:04.190> you<00:03:04.430> want<00:03:04.580> to

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
ball um like I said if you want to

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.160 
ball um like I said if you want to
render<00:03:04.849> with<00:03:05.120> better<00:03:05.299> quality<00:03:05.540> and<00:03:05.930> you<00:03:06.019> can

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
render with better quality and you can

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.660 
render with better quality and you can
Peter<00:03:06.349> can<00:03:06.530> handle<00:03:06.830> it<00:03:06.980> you<00:03:07.099> can<00:03:07.220> always<00:03:07.430> bump

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
Peter can handle it you can always bump

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.870 
Peter can handle it you can always bump
to<00:03:07.819> render<00:03:08.090> subdivision<00:03:08.660> down<00:03:08.840> to<00:03:08.959> one<00:03:09.200> and

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
to render subdivision down to one and

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.100 
to render subdivision down to one and
the<00:03:10.880> editor<00:03:11.239> subdivision<00:03:11.840> down<00:03:11.989> to<00:03:12.140> one<00:03:12.670> so

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
the editor subdivision down to one so

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.610 
the editor subdivision down to one so
that's<00:03:15.110> really<00:03:15.319> simple<00:03:15.650> it's<00:03:15.890> a<00:03:16.069> nice<00:03:16.220> fix<00:03:16.580> and

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
that's really simple it's a nice fix and

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.210 
that's really simple it's a nice fix and
the<00:03:18.620> cloner<00:03:18.920> you<00:03:19.610> can<00:03:19.790> always<00:03:20.030> try<00:03:20.299> it<00:03:20.360> with

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
the cloner you can always try it with

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.880 
the cloner you can always try it with
linear<00:03:22.220> I<00:03:22.720> mean<00:03:23.720> you<00:03:23.870> can<00:03:24.230> really<00:03:24.260> do<00:03:24.620> whatever

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
linear I mean you can really do whatever

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.789 
linear I mean you can really do whatever
you<00:03:25.100> want<00:03:25.340> with<00:03:25.430> this<00:03:25.700> radial<00:03:26.390> it's<00:03:26.930> all<00:03:27.470> up<00:03:27.620> to

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
you want with this radial it's all up to

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.970 
you want with this radial it's all up to
you<00:03:28.510> so<00:03:29.510> this<00:03:29.840> is<00:03:29.870> just<00:03:30.230> whatever<00:03:30.590> you<00:03:30.799> feel

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
like doing um I just find that grid away

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.440 
like doing um I just find that grid away
grid<00:03:34.040> array<00:03:34.250> works<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:34.880> best<00:03:35.030> and<00:03:35.209> you<00:03:35.299> can

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
grid array works the best and you can

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.470 
grid array works the best and you can
always<00:03:35.630> pop<00:03:35.840> up<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:36.170> clones<00:03:36.440> and<00:03:36.709> stuff<00:03:36.950> I'm

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
always pop up the clones and stuff I'm

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.789 
always pop up the clones and stuff I'm
saying<00:03:38.480> I<00:03:38.630> mean<00:03:38.870> that<00:03:39.079> that's<00:03:39.290> really<00:03:39.560> simple

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
saying I mean that that's really simple
