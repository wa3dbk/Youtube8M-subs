00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:12.210
 Hi, everyone. Welcome to another class. 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.269
 biology and in that class we will go 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.699
 understand why removal of the ring 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.720
 malpique makes it possible for a plant to 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.920
 come to die 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.320
 This is what this video came after. 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.710
 growth and secondary video for 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.080
 make it very clear why the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.270
 flow of the elaborate sap to be 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.989
 stopped people in the previous video 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.180
 You saw this image here in this 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.879
 image we saw that the trunk of a 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.010
 tree and even its root it has a 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.020
 organization that is somewhat continuous in 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.579
 relation to their tissues 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.170
 We know the Chilean is well. 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.329
 internalized nÃ© 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.059
 the exchange was who produced the flame 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.789
 inside fame out and we also 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.699
 has more to the periphery of the structure 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.039
 the genius hay that is another exchange is a 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.460
 other fabric - thematic that gave origin 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.710
 to climb out on the plant that is the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.630
 tree bark and philogen 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.380
 worked to produce it fi 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:17.460
 give me inside what would be the 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.799
 ring of malp that several issues of 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.650
 vestibular charges and this is a 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:26.759
 common methodology is used to 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:31.880
 kill trees, right ? 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:36.360
 the pig actually consists of a withdrawal 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.579
 some tissues of the plant are all have 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.650
 that take away the ring given to break in the 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.520
 corner source that drew want 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.619
 see yourself 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.180
 if you fix we take a ring from 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.759
 tree bark 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.619
 only that shell is not only the super 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.750
 that dead tissue in that shell 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.149
 that we can get out of the way 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.619
 You can kill a tree with 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.840
 some efficiency 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.409
 We need to get the ring out of the shell. 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:05.700
 containing the super- phylogeny to 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.259
 the dermis and the flu because people 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.270
 has to generate the problem of something that 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:13.840
 there may be leftovers and suddenly it's a little 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:17.440
 of exchange and oxy motto people who happens 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:22.840
 the fla you know is a fabric he is 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:25.599
 responsible for carrying 6 elaborate and 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.120
 recipe has this name because 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.860
 it was elaborated by the plant itself 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.530
 it was made by the 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.569
 photosynthesizing plant to be 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.860
 actually contains glucose 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.330
 which was produced from the 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.890
 photosynthesis ne 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.489
 then you know the root they are there 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.080
 below ground it does not produce ringworm is 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.299
 impossible for her to do this kind of 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.910
 thing because she has no access to 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:51.310
 logo can not photosynthesize 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.829
 then it is the photosynthetic part of the 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.959
 plant that will produce glucose 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:58.840
 then she who will produce the sap 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:02.709
 elaborated that will go through all the fla 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.690
 emma is the people to be worked out then 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.459
 that has glucose, it has the energy to 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.239
 survival of all organs of the 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.190
 plant 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.959
 then the trunk for example that is not 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.670
 lack of decision in you need 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.290
 glucose to survive 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.840
 arraes who is not a fan of the supporter 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.859
 need glucose to survive 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:24.310
 and all that corruption linked to the 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:26.560
 leaves on then if I shoot the arsenal of 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.540
 peel and you know the problem does 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.230
 part of this ring of bark and sign of evil 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.750
 the glucose that is produced goes 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.060
 try to be led toward the 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.650
 roots but she will not be able to 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.700
 pass from here because the problem was 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.430
 cut 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.799
 so what happens with the passing 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.829
 of time, huh? 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.750
 is this the all made glucose goes 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:52.780
 accumulating and it is on top of this 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:56.139
 place where the malpighi ring was made 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:59.260
 and the roots will stop receiving 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:01.120
 glucose if the roots die they do not 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.190
 they can absorb more water 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.870
 can absorb more minerals 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.250
 then this motto will not be able to 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.090
 transport water and minerals 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:13.060
 enough for all of heaven he 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.180
 survive then what happens to 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.979
 leaves will end up dying and will leave 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.889
 to be elaborated with the passing of 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:24.219
 time the plant dies're 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:27.620
 then the death of the plant occurs due to 

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:31.400
 the death of the roots first right 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:34.940
 to receive elaborate sap and second 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.470
 because the roots died, they do not 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.020
 carry more water and minerals 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.760
 for the branches that can not 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.639
 distribute these nutrients to your 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.699
 leaves that the leaves also end up 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:49.910
 dying that chubby one who 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:52.430
 check here over where you had 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:56.229
 removed from the malpique ring occurs in 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:05:00.410
 due to the accumulation of organic matter right 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:02.690
 coming from this descending glucose 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.120
 which had been previously produced and 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.310
 could not get to the roots if 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:11.810
 accumulated it as far as the problem 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:15.669
 Could a certain kiss go to you? 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.669
 and until the next class
