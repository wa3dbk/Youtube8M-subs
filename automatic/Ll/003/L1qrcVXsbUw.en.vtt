 on my youtube channel the angle 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.609
 of computer science in this video I will make you 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:32.029
 see how to install the recovery team 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:35.719
 in recovery project to do this vi 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.940
 will need the google nexus 4 toolkit which 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.620
 you can download from here as always vi 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.469
 I leave the link in the description of the 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.649
 video before opening the toolkit that 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:47.690
 you have downloaded the device must 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:51.469
 be connected via the USB cable 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.299
 to the computer in mode or fast boot e 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.579
 to enter fastboot mode 

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:58.069
 you will have to switch on in your 4 holding 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.229
 pressed the power button e 

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:02.869
 at the same time the volume key 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:05.780
 minus once you have connected the 

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:06.799
 device in fastboot mode al 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.490
 computer 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.500
 you will need to open the nexus 4 toolkit e 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.130
 you will have to look at it as you see here in 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.109
 Administrator mode once the 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.070
 you will have opened in administrator mode 

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:21.979
 here below 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.560
 we write the option number 6 which would be 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.329
 flash recovery here is accidental recovery 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.530
 available from flash to and on ours 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:29.810
 device 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.939
 and as always in square brackets there 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.670
 remember that the device must be 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.829
 in fastboot mode and then here 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.289
 low we write 6 and give confirmation with 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.100
 send once here will ask us which one 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:42.079
 admissions 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.090
 we want black flash we don't do the 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.729
 number 2 now asks us like one last 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.999
 time if the device is in fast boot 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.090
 fashions and we write yes and as always 

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:54.920
 we send confirmation 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.530
 as you see the leaving toolkit staff 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.210
 our recovery has already finished e 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.280
 will automatically return to the menu 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.869
 start of the toolkit as you can see 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.479
 now you have to disconnect the device 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.030
 from the computer and we move to the phone 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.970
 to see if it has been installed 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.460
 correctly the recovery on ours 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.970
 4 now that we're on our phone 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:21.310
 directly from the fastboot mode 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.910
 we can get into recovery enough 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:28.600
 move with the buttons on the rocker of the 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.580
 fair volume we're going to choose the 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.900
 recovery mode to confirm 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.900
 just press the power button 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.190
 as you can see our memories yes 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.340
 is started and we went to install 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.230
 the touch and recovery version for 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.060
