be overly aggressive I don't want to go
in<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.120> spawn<00:02:30.450> right<00:02:30.660> these<00:02:30.840> guys<00:02:31.110> in<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.740> TDM

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
in and spawn right these guys in a TDM

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.830 
in and spawn right these guys in a TDM
game<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.640> flip<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.030> spawns<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:33.570> really

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
game and flip the spawns and really

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.630 
game and flip the spawns and really
cause<00:02:34.050> some<00:02:34.200> havoc<00:02:34.260> so<00:02:35.010> this<00:02:35.160> is<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.340> good<00:02:35.489> way

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
cause some havoc so this is a good way

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.960 
cause some havoc so this is a good way
to<00:02:35.900> for<00:02:36.900> me<00:02:36.989> to<00:02:37.110> just<00:02:37.319> get<00:02:38.220> my<00:02:38.340> kill<00:02:38.550> streak<00:02:38.820> up

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
to for me to just get my kill streak up

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.729 
to for me to just get my kill streak up
and<00:02:39.120> just<00:02:39.270> control<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.110> center<00:02:40.410> of<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.590> map

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
and just control the center of the map

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.340 
and just control the center of the map
and<00:02:40.980> so<00:02:41.160> consider<00:02:41.970> it<00:02:42.120> that<00:02:42.150> then<00:02:42.780> then<00:02:43.320> I

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
and so consider it that then then I

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.410 
and so consider it that then then I
guess<00:02:43.739> I<00:02:43.920> don't<00:02:44.040> know<00:02:44.130> it's<00:02:44.730> smarter<00:02:45.300> than

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
guess I don't know it's smarter than

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.970 
guess I don't know it's smarter than
than<00:02:45.660> it<00:02:45.780> would<00:02:46.050> have<00:02:46.080> seen<00:02:46.350> like<00:02:46.530> but<00:02:46.769> it<00:02:46.860> is

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
than it would have seen like but it is

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.890 
than it would have seen like but it is
again<00:02:47.610> like<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:47.880> said<00:02:47.910> a<00:02:48.090> little<00:02:48.150> bit<00:02:48.420> campy<00:02:48.630> and

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
again like I said a little bit campy and

trying<00:02:57.420> to<00:02:57.510> come<00:02:57.660> through<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.930> middle<00:02:58.140> area

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
trying to come through the middle area

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.830 
trying to come through the middle area
so<00:02:59.730> i'm<00:02:59.790> waiting<00:02:59.910> on<00:03:00.060> that<00:03:00.090> one<00:03:00.360> last<00:03:00.570> kill

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
so i'm waiting on that one last kill

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.380 
so i'm waiting on that one last kill
field<00:03:01.500> they<00:03:01.560> say<00:03:01.739> c-130<00:03:02.430> up<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:03.090> again<00:03:03.360> I

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
field they say c-130 up and again I

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.210 
field they say c-130 up and again I
always<00:03:03.930> run<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.140> AC<00:03:04.290> 130<00:03:04.680> instead<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.130> the

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
always run the AC 130 instead of the

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.160 
always run the AC 130 instead of the
chopper<00:03:05.550> just<00:03:05.700> because<00:03:06.420> it's<00:03:06.630> harder<00:03:07.140> to

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
chopper just because it's harder to

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.500 
chopper just because it's harder to
shoot<00:03:07.410> down<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:07.890> takes<00:03:08.070> more<00:03:08.970> effort<00:03:09.150> for<00:03:09.480> the

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
shoot down it takes more effort for the

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.440 
shoot down it takes more effort for the
enemy<00:03:09.780> to<00:03:09.810> shoot<00:03:10.080> down<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.730> I<00:03:11.730> don't<00:03:12.299> know<00:03:12.360> the

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
enemy to shoot down and I don't know the

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.530 
enemy to shoot down and I don't know the
choppers<00:03:12.840> can<00:03:13.530> be<00:03:13.739> easier<00:03:14.070> to<00:03:14.130> use<00:03:14.540> definitely

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
choppers can be easier to use definitely

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.300 
choppers can be easier to use definitely
easier<00:03:15.810> to<00:03:15.900> get<00:03:16.079> a<00:03:16.140> lot<00:03:16.290> of<00:03:16.320> kills<00:03:16.560> but<00:03:16.890> the

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
easier to get a lot of kills but the

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.300 
easier to get a lot of kills but the
ac-130<00:03:18.239> works<00:03:18.510> as<00:03:18.630> well<00:03:18.660> especially<00:03:18.989> if<00:03:19.410> you

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
ac-130 works as well especially if you

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.710 
ac-130 works as well especially if you
have<00:03:20.340> this<00:03:20.670> spawn<00:03:21.000> where<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.269> enemies<00:03:21.570> on<00:03:21.690> the

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
have this spawn where the enemies on the

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.060 
have this spawn where the enemies on the
other<00:03:21.930> side<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.410> works<00:03:22.560> out<00:03:22.680> perfectly

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
other side it works out perfectly

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.140 
other side it works out perfectly
because<00:03:23.160> you<00:03:23.400> can<00:03:23.549> actually<00:03:23.579> shoot<00:03:23.970> them

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
because you can actually shoot them

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.140 
because you can actually shoot them
inside<00:03:25.049> of<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.320> building<00:03:25.470> right<00:03:26.459> down<00:03:26.970> there

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
inside of the building right down there

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.819 
inside of the building right down there
you<00:03:27.299> can't<00:03:27.570> necessarily<00:03:27.780> do<00:03:28.380> that<00:03:28.410> on<00:03:28.739> the

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
you can't necessarily do that on the

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.580 
you can't necessarily do that on the
other<00:03:28.890> side<00:03:29.190> but<00:03:29.570> here<00:03:30.570> I<00:03:30.600> am<00:03:30.750> just<00:03:31.230> trying<00:03:31.350> to

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
other side but here I am just trying to

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.289 
other side but here I am just trying to
kill<00:03:32.100> these<00:03:32.280> guys<00:03:32.310> and<00:03:32.579> then<00:03:32.700> try<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.090> figure

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
kill these guys and then try to figure

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:34.280 
kill these guys and then try to figure
out<00:03:33.450> where<00:03:33.570> they<00:03:33.660> are<00:03:33.690> and<00:03:33.959> you<00:03:34.049> can<00:03:34.170> see

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
out where they are and you can see

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.199 
out where they are and you can see
they're<00:03:34.410> spawning<00:03:34.680> down<00:03:34.890> here<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:35.430> down<00:03:36.060> on

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
they're spawning down here and down on

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.569 
they're spawning down here and down on
the<00:03:36.269> next<00:03:36.540> side<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:36.959> failing<00:03:37.500> miserably

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
the next side and failing miserably

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.470 
the next side and failing miserably
trying<00:03:38.579> to<00:03:38.700> kill<00:03:38.850> these<00:03:38.970> guys<00:03:39.000> and<00:03:39.329> I<00:03:39.360> could

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
trying to kill these guys and I could

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.060 
trying to kill these guys and I could
see<00:03:39.630> there's<00:03:39.810> two<00:03:40.079> of<00:03:40.110> them<00:03:40.200> inside<00:03:40.500> that<00:03:40.650> was

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
see there's two of them inside that was

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.220 
see there's two of them inside that was
one<00:03:41.220> of<00:03:41.310> them<00:03:41.400> antenna

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
one of them antenna

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.660 
one of them antenna
let's<00:03:42.739> try<00:03:42.860> to<00:03:42.950> kill<00:03:43.129> that<00:03:43.250> guy<00:03:43.430> but<00:03:43.640> I

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
let's try to kill that guy but I

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.430 
let's try to kill that guy but I
couldn't<00:03:43.940> get<00:03:44.060> them<00:03:44.150> so<00:03:45.050> I'm<00:03:45.140> just<00:03:45.260> going<00:03:45.379> to

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
couldn't get them so I'm just going to

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.259 
couldn't get them so I'm just going to
keep<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:45.739> focusing<00:03:46.159> down<00:03:46.310> over<00:03:46.549> there<00:03:46.700> so<00:03:47.239> I

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
keep the focusing down over there so I

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:48.729 
keep the focusing down over there so I
don't<00:03:47.510> have<00:03:47.629> enough<00:03:47.840> kills<00:03:48.110> I<00:03:48.379> still<00:03:48.650> have

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
don't have enough kills I still have

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.830 
don't have enough kills I still have
four<00:03:48.980> kills<00:03:49.220> left<00:03:49.519> to<00:03:49.970> get<00:03:50.150> so<00:03:50.360> this<00:03:50.480> is<00:03:50.629> the

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
four kills left to get so this is the

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.619 
four kills left to get so this is the
tough<00:03:51.709> part<00:03:51.739> like<00:03:52.340> just<00:03:52.700> this<00:03:53.150> is<00:03:53.330> that<00:03:53.450> moment

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:53.629 
tough part like just this is that moment

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:55.960 
tough part like just this is that moment
and<00:03:53.989> if<00:03:54.409> you<00:03:54.560> you<00:03:55.220> if<00:03:55.400> you've<00:03:55.519> never<00:03:55.700> got<00:03:55.940> a

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
and if you you if you've never got a

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.640 
and if you you if you've never got a
nuke<00:03:56.299> then<00:03:56.629> then<00:03:57.049> you<00:03:57.170> probably<00:03:57.349> don't<00:03:57.560> know

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
nuke then then you probably don't know

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.920 
nuke then then you probably don't know
this<00:03:57.680> feeling<00:03:57.980> but<00:03:58.190> everybody<00:03:59.000> that<00:03:59.480> has<00:03:59.690> got

a Harrier you kidding me like I thought
for<00:04:16.579> sure<00:04:16.609> this<00:04:16.850> I<00:04:17.120> was<00:04:17.269> dead<00:04:17.419> right<00:04:17.600> here<00:04:17.810> and

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
for sure this I was dead right here and

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.050 
for sure this I was dead right here and
so<00:04:18.709> I<00:04:18.739> hugged<00:04:19.010> up<00:04:19.160> against<00:04:19.489> the<00:04:19.579> wall<00:04:19.760> right

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
so I hugged up against the wall right

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.439 
so I hugged up against the wall right
next<00:04:20.449> to<00:04:20.780> that<00:04:21.440> spot<00:04:22.160> and<00:04:22.190> I<00:04:22.729> ended<00:04:23.120> up<00:04:23.240> just

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:23.449 
next to that spot and I ended up just

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:25.390 
next to that spot and I ended up just
going<00:04:23.600> down<00:04:23.810> and<00:04:23.990> inside<00:04:24.260> here<00:04:24.530> because<00:04:24.800> I<00:04:24.979> did

not want to end up getting killed from a
Harrier<00:04:27.830> it's<00:04:28.400> like<00:04:28.520> the<00:04:28.639> worst<00:04:28.789> way<00:04:29.030> to<00:04:29.060> go

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
Harrier it's like the worst way to go

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.790 
Harrier it's like the worst way to go
but<00:04:29.960> I<00:04:29.990> can<00:04:30.199> see<00:04:30.320> that<00:04:30.440> they're<00:04:30.590> still

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
but I can see that they're still

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.110 
but I can see that they're still
splitting<00:04:31.039> in<00:04:31.160> the<00:04:31.220> back<00:04:31.430> so<00:04:31.639> I<00:04:31.669> wanted<00:04:31.970> to<00:04:32.030> try

splitting in the back so I wanted to try

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.670 
splitting in the back so I wanted to try
to<00:04:32.240> kill<00:04:32.449> them<00:04:32.630> and<00:04:32.720> then<00:04:32.900> you<00:04:33.410> can<00:04:33.530> see<00:04:33.650> that

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
to kill them and then you can see that

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.830 
to kill them and then you can see that
that<00:04:33.830> guy<00:04:34.160> just<00:04:35.090> about<00:04:35.300> killed<00:04:35.510> me<00:04:35.660> through
