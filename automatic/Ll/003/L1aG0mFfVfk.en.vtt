00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.150
 followed in the tango argentin tango 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.790
 Argentine is a body walk in 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.100
 movement need to communicate for 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.050
 that the Argentine tango uses breaststroke 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.730
 it's tabra sow who are the 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.490
 different touch points of 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.350
 impose it on the other which will allow 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.690
 make proposals and understand 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.340
 its proposals according to the type 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:50.200
 of aboisso that you have chosen you have 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:53.710
 several points of contact the hands the 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:57.579
 back and forearm of your dancers 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.649
 on you in the back 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.980
 the last point of contact being the 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:05.379
 ventral position the breaststroke must 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.119
 allow both dancers a freedom 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.119
 total movement in the dance 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.680
 how to use the different sensors 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.680
 hands resting on the body of the other 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.780
 have to create space it's this 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.640
 created space that the other is going to look at 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.040
 fill the breaststroke will therefore serve to 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.619
 create space from space to my 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.920
 left of space to my right from 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:32.200
 the space in front of me and if I go back from 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.760
 the space in front of the dancer so let's see 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.210
 with my partner how that 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:41.979
 works I create space 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.790
 on my left my partner will follow me 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.140
 creates space 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:49.299
 on my right a partner will follow me 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.540
 creates space behind her 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:57.310
 my partner follow me I create from 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:02:00.580
 the space behind me my partner me 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.830
 will follow this guidance that use the 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.750
 space creation therefore presupposes on the part 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.090
 of the follower an active role in 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.179
 accompanying his guide in order to 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.579
 create fluidity of flexibility and 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.159
 efficiency in the report guide 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:16.750
 followers this method of monitoring and 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:18.780
 guidance requires from both 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.780
 dancers a total available 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.819
 lity and total body freedom 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.069
 is only within the framework of this freedom 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.420
 that dance can express itself with 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.670
 ease and ease 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.680
 we saw it there in the dance a 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.170
 guide a follower there is a proposal 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.030
 is an answer but there is also the 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.130
 time that everyone can take for his 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.780
 own freedom of expression this is the 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.819
 time that we agree to do this 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.480
 we call adorno d 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.850
 embellishment 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.480
 so here is a simple movement without 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.480
 embellishment 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.930
 here the same movement with the 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.930
 embellishments 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.019
 we have seen today the techniques 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.879
 guiding and tracking in tango 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.260
 Argentine 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:21.890
 find us in an upcoming video 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.329

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.510
 different types of trains this 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.510
 dance
