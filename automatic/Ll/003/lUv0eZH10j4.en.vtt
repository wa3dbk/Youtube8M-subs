00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
because this is not the KD in life I'm

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.120 
because this is not the KD in life I'm
using<00:01:50.479> I'm<00:01:50.810> actually<00:01:51.020> using<00:01:51.320> a<00:01:51.590> newer<00:01:51.860> version

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
using I'm actually using a newer version

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.300 
using I'm actually using a newer version
on<00:01:52.400> the<00:01:52.520> other<00:01:52.550> PC<00:01:53.210> and<00:01:53.710> this<00:01:54.710> one<00:01:54.950> here<00:01:55.100> keeps

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
on the other PC and this one here keeps

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.670 
on the other PC and this one here keeps
crashing<00:01:55.880> so<00:01:56.090> I<00:01:56.119> only<00:01:56.390> can<00:01:56.660> show<00:01:56.960> you<00:01:57.020> one<00:01:57.410> cut

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
crashing so I only can show you one cut

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.350 
crashing so I only can show you one cut
and<00:01:57.710> then<00:01:58.070> you<00:01:58.220> can<00:01:58.400> do<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:58.670> other<00:01:58.700> cuts<00:01:59.180> in

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
and then you can do the other cuts in

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.350 
and then you can do the other cuts in
the<00:01:59.450> same<00:01:59.690> fashion<00:01:59.990> I<00:02:00.320> will<00:02:01.310> add<00:02:01.520> the<00:02:01.970> finished

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
the same fashion I will add the finished

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.920 
the same fashion I will add the finished
video<00:02:02.570> in<00:02:03.170> Ave<00:02:04.160> in<00:02:04.640> our<00:02:04.850> version<00:02:05.119> without<00:02:05.479> my

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
video in Ave in our version without my

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.949 
video in Ave in our version without my
fix<00:02:06.229> and<00:02:06.470> fix<00:02:06.800> so<00:02:07.220> you<00:02:07.280> can<00:02:07.850> see<00:02:08.810> the

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
fix and fix so you can see the

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.850 
fix and fix so you can see the
difference<00:02:09.550> so<00:02:10.550> first<00:02:11.150> make<00:02:11.989> sure<00:02:12.050> you<00:02:12.530> save

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
difference so first make sure you save

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.800 
difference so first make sure you save
this<00:02:13.310> one<00:02:13.489> as<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:13.700> project<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:16.060> add<00:02:17.060> clip<00:02:18.310> and

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
this one as a project and add clip and

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.660 
this one as a project and add clip and
open<00:02:20.810> your<00:02:20.989> clips<00:02:21.290> first<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.830> videos<00:02:22.190> or

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
open your clips first the videos or

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:35.850 
open your clips first the videos or
however<00:02:23.950> then

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.350 

so<00:02:36.730> here<00:02:37.000> are<00:02:37.090> my<00:02:37.120> videos<00:02:37.930> and<00:02:38.290> my<00:02:38.440> audios

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
so here are my videos and my audios

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.390 
so here are my videos and my audios
don't<00:02:40.360> track<00:02:40.960> it<00:02:40.990> in<00:02:41.320> here<00:02:41.710> into<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.130> clip

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
don't track it in here into the clip

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.800 
don't track it in here into the clip
monitor<00:02:43.000> because<00:02:44.700> here<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:45.940> editing<00:02:46.390> doesn't

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
monitor because here the editing doesn't

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.160 
monitor because here the editing doesn't
work<00:02:47.020> and<00:02:47.350> so<00:02:48.070> what<00:02:48.250> I<00:02:48.280> do<00:02:48.430> I<00:02:48.940> drop<00:02:49.750> it<00:02:49.960> here

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
work and so what I do I drop it here

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.480 
work and so what I do I drop it here
into<00:02:50.410> the<00:02:50.560> timeline<00:02:51.300> first<00:02:52.300> the<00:02:52.480> video<00:02:52.840> and

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
into the timeline first the video and

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.550 
into the timeline first the video and
then<00:02:54.490> the<00:02:54.790> appropriate<00:02:55.300> audio<00:02:57.780> so<00:02:58.780> that's<00:02:59.410> why

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
then the appropriate audio so that's why

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.620 
then the appropriate audio so that's why
I<00:02:59.590> use<00:02:59.770> the<00:02:59.950> same<00:03:00.220> name<00:03:00.490> so<00:03:00.790> you<00:03:00.850> can<00:03:01.120> see<00:03:01.360> the

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
I use the same name so you can see the

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
I use the same name so you can see the
same<00:03:01.870> names<00:03:02.200> belong<00:03:02.920> together<00:03:03.180> then<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:05.350> next

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
same names belong together then the next

video file I just created so you have to

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.470 
video file I just created so you have to
know<00:03:44.800> be<00:03:44.980> careful<00:03:45.190> with<00:03:45.580> tracking<00:03:46.060> these

know be careful with tracking these

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.520 
know be careful with tracking these
things<00:03:46.780> around<00:03:47.200> so<00:03:47.560> what<00:03:47.920> I'll<00:03:48.340> do<00:03:48.670> is<00:03:49.410> first<00:03:50.410> I

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
things around so what I'll do is first I

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.610 
things around so what I'll do is first I
make<00:03:50.709> match<00:03:53.550> okay<00:03:54.550> I<00:03:54.989> want<00:03:55.989> it<00:03:56.080> from<00:03:56.290> here

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
make match okay I want it from here

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.550 
make match okay I want it from here
about<00:03:56.940> just<00:03:57.940> roughly<00:03:58.390> you<00:03:58.540> can<00:03:58.570> zoom<00:03:58.959> in<00:03:59.200> here

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
about just roughly you can zoom in here

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.290 
about just roughly you can zoom in here
and<00:03:59.709> get<00:04:00.370> a<00:04:00.400> more<00:04:00.760> detailed<00:04:02.790> view<00:04:03.790> of<00:04:04.090> what's

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
and get a more detailed view of what's

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.990 
and get a more detailed view of what's
going<00:04:04.660> on<00:04:04.840> in<00:04:05.050> the<00:04:05.290> files<00:04:05.769> here<00:04:06.510> so<00:04:07.510> I<00:04:07.950> just<00:04:09.000> do

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
going on in the files here so I just do

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.229 
going on in the files here so I just do
it<00:04:10.120> roughly<00:04:10.630> like<00:04:10.780> this<00:04:11.459> then<00:04:12.459> the<00:04:12.760> next<00:04:13.060> one

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
it roughly like this then the next one

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.440 
it roughly like this then the next one
is<00:04:13.420> I<00:04:13.630> poured<00:04:14.050> from<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.380> front<00:04:14.910> to<00:04:15.910> this<00:04:16.090> line

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
is I poured from the front to this line

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.500 
is I poured from the front to this line
here<00:04:16.709> exactly<00:04:17.709> and<00:04:18.100> I<00:04:18.519> do<00:04:18.580> the<00:04:18.850> same<00:04:18.880> with<00:04:19.150> the

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
here exactly and I do the same with the

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:25.590 
here exactly and I do the same with the
audio<00:04:19.930> file<00:04:23.310> then<00:04:24.310> I<00:04:24.640> find<00:04:24.940> the<00:04:25.060> spot<00:04:25.360> where<00:04:25.570> I

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
audio file then I find the spot where I

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.010 
audio file then I find the spot where I
want<00:04:25.810> to<00:04:25.960> cut<00:04:26.830> out

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
want to cut out

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.440 
want to cut out
that's<00:04:29.020> it<00:04:29.260> that's<00:04:29.410> all<00:04:29.590> I<00:04:29.650> want<00:04:30.270> maybe<00:04:31.270> I<00:04:31.390> just

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
that's it that's all I want maybe I just

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.330 
that's it that's all I want maybe I just
leave<00:04:31.840> it<00:04:31.870> like<00:04:31.990> this<00:04:32.550> and<00:04:34.950> pour<00:04:35.950> them<00:04:36.130> from

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
leave it like this and pour them from

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.320 
leave it like this and pour them from
the<00:04:36.490> back<00:04:36.700> to<00:04:36.910> the<00:04:37.030> front<00:04:37.410> and<00:04:38.940> do<00:04:39.940> the<00:04:40.090> same

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
the back to the front and do the same

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:47.310 
the back to the front and do the same
with<00:04:40.540> the<00:04:40.720> audio<00:04:41.080> farm

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:54.160 

so<00:04:48.320> now<00:04:48.680> I<00:04:48.710> just<00:04:48.860> pull<00:04:49.630> the<00:04:50.630> video<00:04:50.930> file<00:04:53.050> we<00:04:54.050> all

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
so now I just pull the video file we all

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.530 
so now I just pull the video file we all
want<00:04:54.350> to<00:04:54.470> have<00:04:54.590> it<00:04:54.770> and<00:04:55.000> the<00:04:56.000> audio<00:04:56.300> file

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
want to have it and the audio file

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.120 
want to have it and the audio file
always<00:04:57.730> underneath<00:04:59.080> you<00:05:00.080> also<00:05:00.260> can<00:05:00.620> drop<00:05:00.950> the

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
always underneath you also can drop the

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.200 
always underneath you also can drop the
audio<00:05:01.280> file<00:05:01.700> into<00:05:02.210> the<00:05:02.360> audio<00:05:02.660> file<00:05:02.930> line<00:05:03.350> here

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
audio file into the audio file line here

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.940 
audio file into the audio file line here
but<00:05:05.210> I<00:05:06.490> don't<00:05:07.490> know<00:05:07.730> if<00:05:07.850> it's<00:05:08.000> important<00:05:08.510> okay

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
but I don't know if it's important okay

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.590 
but I don't know if it's important okay
so<00:05:09.950> next<00:05:10.190> thing<00:05:10.370> would<00:05:10.610> be<00:05:10.670> taking<00:05:11.330> the<00:05:11.450> next

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
so next thing would be taking the next

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.680 
so next thing would be taking the next
video<00:05:12.340> dropping<00:05:13.340> the<00:05:13.580> next<00:05:13.820> video<00:05:13.970> in<00:05:14.210> here

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
video dropping the next video in here

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.870 
video dropping the next video in here
and<00:05:14.900> then<00:05:15.260> cutting<00:05:15.800> out<00:05:15.920> my<00:05:15.950> piece<00:05:16.400> and<00:05:16.430> doing

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
and then cutting out my piece and doing

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.820 
and then cutting out my piece and doing
the<00:05:16.970> same<00:05:17.210> thing<00:05:17.420> with<00:05:17.570> the<00:05:17.810> audio<00:05:18.200> maybe

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
the same thing with the audio maybe

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.610 
the same thing with the audio maybe
three<00:05:19.250> four<00:05:19.550> whatever<00:05:19.790> how<00:05:20.270> many<00:05:20.350> videos<00:05:21.350> want

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
three four whatever how many videos want
