00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.350
 josé red pacheta good night very good welcome the first free 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.160
 straight to this house I watch television 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.290
 nor weeks 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.189
 that's why you should not get in there 

00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:12.379
 the information to all the is once 

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:17.470
 we declare our addition to a gathering or these things no no no no I am 

00:00:17.469 --> 00:00:19.939
 I showed why its name 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.279
 I prefer to go to press conference the press center asked 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.130
 we have expressed and do not prolong that bimbo company for a very simple thing 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.829
 that everyone will understand 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.439
 you've already won three games in front of the Real Oviedo two victories a draw 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.560
 cospedal turia with 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.280
 that team to the wrong drumstick one last minute 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.900
 I think it's time to talk about everything that's going on. 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.680
 these days bendodo pacheta 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.380
 we will talk in all baby pacheta 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.430
 comos against how you're finding players 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.540
 a little of everything 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.660
 the first 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.810
 so he found already what the team lacks after seeing the 'u' did this 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.420
 tomorrow in the plain brothers 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.020
 noel I keep looking for your awning using the detail to grow the detail of that 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.990
 grow the player 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.940
 if we are able to make my players better than the one in front 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.070
 10% of the party that won us 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.620
 if we are able to have seven best 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.050
 we have 30% for the final 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.140
 you have to go looking for what equipment is better than the one in front if I get in addition 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.620
 together we are capable 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.190
 to help each other 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.500
 so that he who is capable of not being able 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.810
 to win his duel 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.710
 miss him but he gave him a hand other we are not equal acts 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.479
 all the details so that the game is growing and is believing in what you see 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.110
 the coaches count 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.040
 little by little it seems that it is being achieved because, according to the 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.909
 results according to what was seen at least in the two home games 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.250
 also outside but especially in the house 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.930
 he was injured sprint so in which the roll in man against man 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.090
 especially from murcia team that begins to believe in what to do 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.119
 that's my mission mission is that the player believes in what makes that 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.010
 believe that the training 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.130
 while 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.280
 to win on Sunday 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.700
 that what it puts them without entering the tone that faces on Sunday and that arrives 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.850
 to Sunday with the least possible doubts of what is going to face me 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.090
 I am capable of doing that and if on top of it 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.230
 the 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.100
 the credit that you want 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.549
 very high with respect sets 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.149
 you're always looking for that but this all this 

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:12.460
 in not worth anything 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.140
 if one does not move it, we do not win 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.619
 well we can play well with his son of god if we do not win 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:21.409
 oppositional internet to the ground falls all ground come the criticisms of everything 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:23.350
 we all know that we have to keep winning 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.609
 lion petrus and surely 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:29.119
 we are happy that we lose but that we do not have a high sense of the world 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:31.109
 ee and in bid not 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.380
 we are not in the same situation as three weeks ago 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.419
 we are in deals with employment descent 

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:39.619
 we are five points above p the team begins to believe in other things 

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:42.019
 and that's very important if we win a tooth 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.450
 percent we get in 36 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.900
 already percent 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.350
 salvation is very close 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.209
 and once we extend that 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.910
 the team I know that is able to drop headquarters to do more things than it does 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:55.779
 is that I think it's doing a lot 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:59.689
 many people commented that their players that you have right now do not 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:00.559
 nevertheless 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:04.529
 not prepared but we have used to play down there 

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:06.629
 in that position of the classification 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:11.629
 that as soon as it rises opposites are going to be giving more imas and probably 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.610
 there will be a team 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.329
 that the season encouraged us 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.830
 sometimes they lead these negative dynamics in the social because 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.830
 the world is not just leaving them not 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.229
 they have defeatism in malpartida and others and it is difficult these group dynamics 

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:32.760
 that of those who talk so much psychoanalytic psychologist - is complex 

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:38.529
 and of course he's still with a team prepared to fight for what I believe 

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:39.640
 for being up 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.199
 when we play with 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:44.950
 the ball is no longer as round as all the space is produced much more 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.100
 the confidence that I have in the control pass 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.939
 control is going to give me paceña seems 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:53.109
 will not suppose tenerife or why then because that is a vision of state in 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.540
 First division teams like Malaga are down with a budget 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.039
 very cultured hawk 

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:02.039
 if all this was budget budget we know how it is first 

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:05.039
 second third quarter but not in a very rich football 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:09.710
 but she drives but when the ball does not want to enter not enter point no no no 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:10.580
 one and at the end 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.590
 that little plate that you do not enter that goes to the stick 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.639
 the health program package 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.639
 Chiguana promises to come out as the vote with the post and tenacity 

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:23.789
 has supported the real oviedo the team is not that it will not be very different from what 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:24.930
 We're seeing 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.710
 you arrived heavy hashém 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.689
 maybe because first thing 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:31.590
 what you said separately man against man 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.979
 ni fumas directo greece is the day of your presentation 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.689
 the oviedo probably to a football that some like and others are not in 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:40.479
 a brochure and good füle then 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.680
 practiced to come you have to go to win 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.800
 the weapons to do it are these 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.479
 He is happy but he cites what the young man is finding himself wrong 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:49.879
 blond 

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:50.969
 I am delighted 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:54.110
 percent the summary of the last one-way game is 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.050
 ten goal chances because he saw it 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.639
 4 consummation of your part of the athletic 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:02.069
 approaches because it's a goal chances a center then I have not had and 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:03.169
 efe 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:04.749
 28s 

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:08.949
 p I am in green mind delighted with the response of the footballer 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:13.229
 of how it's growing since how we're admitting workouts 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.689
 p tips in talks as established 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:20.659
 but the mind 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:23.070
 the people when you see your team as a cross 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.970
 what if 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.139
 very happy answer 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:29.699
 wim kok of mostly because of the three weeks in office and cassano to all 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:32.699
 the players the other day we could see that in return as you will know zárate 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:34.300
 that is to say 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.110
 you start to endorse them personally and that also the player has 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.229
 known to value the discomfort over always supporting them never 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.450
 the tenth thing out of tune there was nothing to receive from me 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:49.219
 criticism at a public level 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:51.650
 never and if there was ever I do 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.979
 I will do it without intending to steal 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:55.080
 for one hundrerd 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.279
 the cut where he knows 

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:59.369
 you have to beat a series of orders 

00:05:59.369 --> 00:06:02.180
 but he has to be comfortable with this happy in what he does 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.500
 that he knows he runs and we will break alive ii run and push again and he has the 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.500
 honesty and and playing football I think that you 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:16.830
 but in the end happy 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.939
 I think that in that he did try 

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:20.730
 the soccer player feels comfortable with me 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.669
 I am always open to dialogue 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:24.930
 absolutely everything 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.870
 I understand much more about the dialogue my personal life professional life 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.889
 everything was in my life 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:32.379
 I cross this also admits 

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:35.339
 above all they have admitted that he knew with 11 

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:36.560
 and they are admitting 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.629
 the one who can expose a change 

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:40.939
 so that it is repaired that receives the prize 

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:42.069

 in trucks until the 20th minute 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.869
 that what I'm looking for more is the prize 

00:06:46.869 --> 00:06:49.029
 from which you remove 

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:52.579
 and of course that the one who plays if you dye minutes has to do what 

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:55.799
 you have from pilibhit play 90 percent to 90 pesos 13 cuts 

00:06:57.139 --> 00:06:58.650
 sometimes skimming the prize 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.300
 someone who was wearing 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.349
 many less bad 

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:04.089

 and you're looking for a prize for him 

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:12.529
 there are many situations that I understand that there 

00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:14.439
 there are many things that understand us 

00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:16.599
 but grigor dimitrov others 

00:07:16.599 --> 00:07:17.600
