launcher and level one armor both of

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:12.209 
launcher and level one armor both of
those<00:04:03.909> should<00:04:04.150> be<00:04:04.180> very<00:04:04.480> useful<00:04:11.219> still

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:12.219 
those should be very useful still

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:17.580

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
controls most of the populated area the

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.620 
controls most of the populated area the
commander<00:04:18.070> wants<00:04:18.220> us<00:04:18.400> to<00:04:18.549> focus<00:04:18.699> on<00:04:19.000> abduction

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
commander wants us to focus on abduction

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.010 
commander wants us to focus on abduction
next<00:04:19.989> if<00:04:20.799> the<00:04:20.949> EDF<00:04:21.340> loses<00:04:21.880> the<00:04:22.000> factor<00:04:22.449> they

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
next if the EDF loses the factor they

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.180 
next if the EDF loses the factor they
lose<00:04:23.259> their<00:04:23.500> main<00:04:23.710> source<00:04:23.949> of<00:04:24.130> income<00:04:24.370> on<00:04:24.789> Mars

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
lose their main source of income on Mars

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.810 
lose their main source of income on Mars
so<00:04:27.190> I<00:04:27.220> guess<00:04:27.400> we're<00:04:27.490> going<00:04:27.580> to<00:04:27.639> hit<00:04:27.789> the

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
so I guess we're going to hit the

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:35.070 
so I guess we're going to hit the
industrial<00:04:28.449> area<00:04:28.660> of<00:04:29.020> Mars<00:04:29.349> next<00:04:34.080> alright

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
industrial area of Mars next alright

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.540 
industrial area of Mars next alright
let's<00:04:35.169> say<00:04:35.410> we<00:04:35.530> go<00:04:35.620> back<00:04:35.650> to<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:36.039> safe<00:04:36.280> house

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
let's say we go back to the safe house

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.749 
let's say we go back to the safe house
and<00:04:36.970> end<00:04:37.300> this<00:04:37.570> one<00:04:37.870> now<00:04:38.560> the<00:04:38.620> map<00:04:39.039> is<00:04:39.280> opened

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 
and end this one now the map is opened

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:41.850 
and end this one now the map is opened
up<00:04:39.880> and<00:04:40.090> it's<00:04:40.210> obviously<00:04:40.780> much<00:04:41.020> larger<00:04:41.530> as<00:04:41.740> we

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
up and it's obviously much larger as we

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.550 
up and it's obviously much larger as we
can<00:04:42.039> go<00:04:42.190> into<00:04:42.370> dust<00:04:43.020> that<00:04:44.020> is<00:04:44.169> a<00:04:44.199> lot<00:04:44.500> of

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
can go into dust that is a lot of

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.439 
can go into dust that is a lot of
buildings<00:04:45.039> that's<00:04:45.789> probably<00:04:45.940> like<00:04:46.150> a<00:04:46.180> little

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
buildings that's probably like a little

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.439 
buildings that's probably like a little
mini<00:04:46.630> base<00:04:46.870> over<00:04:47.139> there<00:04:47.289> but<00:04:48.180> let's<00:04:49.180> go<00:04:49.270> back

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
mini base over there but let's go back

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:54.330 
mini base over there but let's go back
to<00:04:49.479> the<00:04:49.660> safe<00:04:49.840> house<00:04:50.020> for<00:04:50.050> now<00:04:52.349> and<00:04:53.349> stock<00:04:54.310> up

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
to the safe house for now and stock up

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.219 
to the safe house for now and stock up
on<00:04:54.580> some<00:04:54.789> stuff<00:04:55.000> possibly<00:04:55.240> buy<00:04:55.630> some<00:04:55.900> upgrades

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
on some stuff possibly buy some upgrades

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.620 
on some stuff possibly buy some upgrades
but<00:04:56.349> I<00:04:56.409> have<00:04:56.530> enough<00:04:56.940> scrap<00:04:57.940> which<00:04:58.330> I<00:04:58.419> probably

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
but I have enough scrap which I probably

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.409 
but I have enough scrap which I probably
don't<00:04:58.900> for<00:04:59.289> anything<00:04:59.470> good<00:04:59.830> I'm<00:05:00.820> interested

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
don't for anything good I'm interested

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.520 
don't for anything good I'm interested
in<00:05:01.510> that<00:05:01.599> level<00:05:01.780> one<00:05:02.050> armor<00:05:03.120> that's<00:05:04.120> what's

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
in that level one armor that's what's

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.590 
in that level one armor that's what's
interesting<00:05:05.530> me<00:05:05.919> now

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.159 

I<00:05:09.660> like<00:05:10.290> good<00:05:10.560> defense

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
I like good defense

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:23.730 
I like good defense
means<00:05:12.680> I<00:05:12.800> don't<00:05:12.979> die<00:05:13.189> as<00:05:13.430> fast<00:05:13.699> obviously

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.110 

but<00:05:24.310> I<00:05:24.340> don't<00:05:24.639> think<00:05:24.699> I'd<00:05:24.849> be<00:05:24.940> able<00:05:24.970> to

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
but I don't think I'd be able to

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.770 
but I don't think I'd be able to
liberate<00:05:25.270> the<00:05:25.569> first<00:05:25.810> area<00:05:26.470> that<00:05:26.710> quickly

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
liberate the first area that quickly

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.010 
liberate the first area that quickly
next<00:05:28.780> area<00:05:29.020> seems<00:05:29.319> way<00:05:29.949> bigger<00:05:30.310> so<00:05:30.849> I<00:05:31.210> guess

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
next area seems way bigger so I guess

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.930 
next area seems way bigger so I guess
we're<00:05:32.229> out<00:05:32.289> a<00:05:32.319> little<00:05:32.650> tutorial<00:05:33.130> area<00:05:33.669> and
