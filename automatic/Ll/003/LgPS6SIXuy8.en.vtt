00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.070 

painting<00:00:01.439> phase<00:00:01.709> option<00:00:02.340> so<00:00:03.330> if<00:00:03.600> you<00:00:03.750> needed

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
painting phase option so if you needed

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.050 
painting phase option so if you needed
something<00:00:04.380> other<00:00:04.710> than<00:00:04.950> noise<00:00:05.310> other<00:00:05.850> than

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
something other than noise other than

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.419 
something other than noise other than
specularity<00:00:06.770> another<00:00:07.770> thing<00:00:08.040> that<00:00:08.220> you<00:00:08.250> can

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
specularity another thing that you can

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.320 
specularity another thing that you can
add<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:09.170> the<00:00:10.170> finite<00:00:10.620> details<00:00:10.889> so<00:00:11.670> in<00:00:12.059> this

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
add is the finite details so in this

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.350 
add is the finite details so in this
case<00:00:12.860> I<00:00:13.860> have<00:00:14.160> this<00:00:14.429> really<00:00:14.670> cool<00:00:14.790> stencil<00:00:15.330> of

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
case I have this really cool stencil of

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.090 
case I have this really cool stencil of
a<00:00:15.480> hand<00:00:15.780> like<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.320> white<00:00:16.529> hand<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:16.920> Saruman

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
a hand like the white hand of Saruman

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.400 
a hand like the white hand of Saruman
and<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:18.180> thought<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:18.840> would<00:00:18.990> be<00:00:19.109> kind<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.350> cool

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
and I thought it would be kind of cool

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.529 
and I thought it would be kind of cool
to<00:00:20.720> go<00:00:21.720> in<00:00:22.160> to<00:00:23.160> one<00:00:23.340> of<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.550> layers<00:00:23.820> here<00:00:24.330> on

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
to go in to one of the layers here on

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.769 
to go in to one of the layers here on
this<00:00:24.720> object<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.439> add<00:00:26.130> that<00:00:26.369> in<00:00:26.580> so<00:00:27.119> i<00:00:27.150> got<00:00:27.660> the

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
this object and add that in so i got the

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.900 
this object and add that in so i got the
object<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.349> i<00:00:28.529> gotta<00:00:28.740> diffuse<00:00:29.310> layer<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.760> I

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
object and i gotta diffuse layer and I

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.020 
object and i gotta diffuse layer and I
gotta<00:00:30.090> specularity<00:00:30.660> layer<00:00:31.430> so<00:00:32.430> what<00:00:32.940> I'm

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
gotta specularity layer so what I'm

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.440 
gotta specularity layer so what I'm
going<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.210> do<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.600> go<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.899> diffuser<00:00:34.620> area

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
going to do is go to the diffuser area

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:42.830 
going to do is go to the diffuser area
got<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.630> down<00:00:38.420> hit<00:00:39.420> add<00:00:39.800> new<00:00:40.800> diffuse<00:00:41.840> and

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
got that down hit add new diffuse and

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.750 
got that down hit add new diffuse and
I'll<00:00:43.079> just<00:00:43.290> call<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.620> hand<00:00:44.010> just<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:44.610> i<00:00:44.640> can

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
I'll just call this hand just so i can

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.450 
I'll just call this hand just so i can
get<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.180> or<00:00:46.140> know<00:00:46.829> where<00:00:46.860> it's<00:00:47.219> at<00:00:47.960> in<00:00:49.280> unit<00:00:50.280> 1

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
get it or know where it's at in unit 1

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.270 
get it or know where it's at in unit 1
80<00:00:50.640> chad<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.210> make<00:00:51.300> stencils<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:52.410> we're<00:00:52.860> going

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
80 chad and make stencils so we're going

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.270 
80 chad and make stencils so we're going
to<00:00:53.370> use<00:00:53.579> this<00:00:53.730> stencil<00:00:54.289> s<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.739> keyboard<00:00:56.219> to

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
to use this stencil s on the keyboard to

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.799 
to use this stencil s on the keyboard to
stamp<00:00:59.280> right<00:00:59.760> in<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.120> area<00:01:02.420> and<00:01:03.420> i<00:01:03.539> think<00:01:03.719> it

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
stamp right in this area and i think it

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.210 
stamp right in this area and i think it
would<00:01:03.930> be<00:01:04.049> better<00:01:04.229> on<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.619> side<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:04.949> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
would be better on the side of the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:14.149 
would be better on the side of the
creature<00:01:09.229> now<00:01:10.229> i<00:01:10.439> like<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.950> just<00:01:10.979> right<00:01:13.159> right

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
creature now i like it just right right

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.270 
creature now i like it just right right
there

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.750 

perfect<00:01:22.850> all<00:01:23.850> right<00:01:24.030> now<00:01:24.330> since<00:01:24.750> this<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.170> a

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
perfect all right now since this is a

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:35.030 
perfect all right now since this is a
stencil<00:01:26.760> and<00:01:30.619> go<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:31.770> here<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:33.799> I'm<00:01:34.799> just

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
stencil and go in here and I'm just

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.399 
stencil and go in here and I'm just
seeing<00:01:36.030> if<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.300> can<00:01:36.360> make<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.810> little<00:01:37.110> bit

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
seeing if I can make that a little bit

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.660 
seeing if I can make that a little bit
more<00:01:37.590> visible<00:01:39.649> go<00:01:40.649> to<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.950> paint<00:01:41.190> tools<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.640> can

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
more visible go to the paint tools I can

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:49.190 
more visible go to the paint tools I can
either<00:01:42.000> project<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.780> on<00:01:46.700> like<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:48.170> or<00:01:49.170> I

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
either project it on like that or I

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.020 
either project it on like that or I
could<00:01:49.470> have<00:01:49.560> painted<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:50.100> on<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.520> like<00:01:50.880> the

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
could have painted it on I like the

00:01:51.030 --> 00:02:02.300 
could have painted it on I like the
projection<00:01:57.770> perfect<00:01:59.450> now<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:00.750> like<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.409> but

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
projection perfect now I like that but

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.029 
projection perfect now I like that but
what<00:02:02.789> if<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:03.210> was<00:02:03.390> shiny<00:02:03.929> in<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.380> area<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:05.009> you

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
what if it was shiny in that area so you

do here is I'm going to project it here
in<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.019> specularity<00:02:52.739> and<00:02:53.209> that<00:02:54.209> will<00:02:54.480> make

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
in the specularity and that will make

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:04.849 
in the specularity and that will make
that<00:02:56.220> hand<00:02:56.609> shiny<00:03:01.910> perfect<00:03:03.079> so<00:03:04.079> now<00:03:04.530> let's

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
that hand shiny perfect so now let's

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.770 
that hand shiny perfect so now let's
turn<00:03:05.040> off<00:03:05.100> our<00:03:05.310> stencil<00:03:05.760> by<00:03:06.030> hitting<00:03:06.269> Q<00:03:06.570> and

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
turn off our stencil by hitting Q and

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.580 
turn off our stencil by hitting Q and
you<00:03:07.620> can<00:03:07.799> see<00:03:08.010> I<00:03:08.220> got<00:03:08.640> that<00:03:08.910> but<00:03:09.870> I<00:03:09.930> don't<00:03:10.320> like

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
you can see I got that but I don't like

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.160 
you can see I got that but I don't like
how<00:03:10.829> it's<00:03:11.010> right<00:03:11.340> here<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:12.030> see<00:03:12.239> that<00:03:12.480> like<00:03:12.930> in

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
how it's right here you see that like in

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.360 
how it's right here you see that like in
the<00:03:13.410> skull<00:03:13.880> those<00:03:14.880> orbital<00:03:15.299> sockets<00:03:15.720> back

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
the skull those orbital sockets back

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.890 
the skull those orbital sockets back
might<00:03:17.370> not<00:03:17.549> have<00:03:17.790> that<00:03:18.000> amount<00:03:18.269> of<00:03:18.420> detail<00:03:18.750> so

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
might not have that amount of detail so

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.860 
might not have that amount of detail so
what<00:03:19.049> I'm<00:03:19.140> going<00:03:19.260> to<00:03:19.320> do<00:03:19.470> is<00:03:20.120> there<00:03:21.120> is<00:03:21.150> a<00:03:21.359> paint

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
what I'm going to do is there is a paint

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.470 
what I'm going to do is there is a paint
erase<00:03:22.519> and<00:03:23.519> if<00:03:24.030> I<00:03:24.180> go<00:03:24.390> to<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.630> diffuse<00:03:25.109> one<00:03:25.380> I

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
erase and if I go to the diffuse one I

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:36.470 
erase and if I go to the diffuse one I
can<00:03:27.480> kind<00:03:28.440> of<00:03:28.500> erase<00:03:28.920> that<00:03:29.220> back

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.759 

and<00:03:37.480> it<00:03:37.689> probably<00:03:37.720> wouldn't<00:03:38.230> get<00:03:38.349> into<00:03:38.530> the

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
and it probably wouldn't get into the

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:48.420 
and it probably wouldn't get into the
nose<00:03:38.980> area<00:03:39.250> either<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:46.709> then<00:03:47.709> I'll<00:03:47.980> just<00:03:48.040> go

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
nose area either and then I'll just go

00:03:48.430 --> 00:04:02.870 
nose area either and then I'll just go
to<00:03:48.489> the<00:03:48.640> specularity<00:03:49.150> and<00:03:49.480> do<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.659> same<00:03:49.840> thing

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:18.770 

perfect<00:04:03.880> that's<00:04:04.750> exactly<00:04:04.840> what<00:04:05.350> I<00:04:05.380> want<00:04:10.380> nice

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.680 

all<00:04:19.780> right<00:04:19.959> so<00:04:20.320> I<00:04:20.350> have<00:04:20.650> everything<00:04:21.510> all<00:04:22.510> the

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
all right so I have everything all the

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.730 
all right so I have everything all the
options<00:04:22.870> I<00:04:23.380> took<00:04:24.150> and<00:04:25.260> now<00:04:26.260> if<00:04:26.410> you<00:04:26.530> go<00:04:26.680> to

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
options I took and now if you go to

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.490 
options I took and now if you go to
display<00:04:27.280> you<00:04:27.730> can<00:04:27.940> go<00:04:28.120> to<00:04:28.180> flat<00:04:28.810> lighting<00:04:29.320> and

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
display you can go to flat lighting and

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.620 
display you can go to flat lighting and
this<00:04:29.800> is<00:04:29.950> what<00:04:30.160> I<00:04:30.190> have<00:04:30.540> we<00:04:31.540> need<00:04:31.690> to<00:04:31.840> cure<00:04:32.260> this

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
this is what I have we need to cure this

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.790 
this is what I have we need to cure this
this<00:04:34.630> is<00:04:34.840> what<00:04:35.020> it<00:04:35.110> kind<00:04:35.290> of<00:04:35.410> looks<00:04:35.680> like

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
this is what it kind of looks like

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.460 
this is what it kind of looks like
without<00:04:36.130> any<00:04:36.520> shading<00:04:36.910> capabilities<00:04:37.780> we<00:04:38.290> need

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
without any shading capabilities we need

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.130 
without any shading capabilities we need
to<00:04:38.620> be<00:04:38.740> able<00:04:38.830> to<00:04:39.100> have<00:04:39.340> the<00:04:39.550> shading<00:04:40.140> available

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
to be able to have the shading available

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.280 
to be able to have the shading available
on<00:04:41.380> the<00:04:41.950> actual<00:04:42.220> skull<00:04:42.550> so<00:04:43.420> that's<00:04:43.690> why<00:04:44.020> we

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
on the actual skull so that's why we

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.070 
on the actual skull so that's why we
export<00:04:45.100> and<00:04:45.700> combine<00:04:46.390> all<00:04:46.630> these<00:04:46.780> great

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
export and combine all these great

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.710 
export and combine all these great
textures<00:04:47.560> together<00:04:47.830> and<00:04:48.250> that's<00:04:48.670> where<00:04:49.060> the

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
textures together and that's where the

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.140 
textures together and that's where the
next<00:04:49.990> video<00:04:50.200> comes<00:04:50.410> in<00:04:50.650> all<00:04:51.310> right<00:04:51.490> so<00:04:51.790> no<00:04:52.000> more

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
next video comes in all right so no more

00:04:52.150 --> 00:05:02.780 
next video comes in all right so no more
options<00:04:52.600> let's<00:04:53.440> go<00:04:53.590> to<00:04:53.680> that<00:04:54.100> phase

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:24.780 

you

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.340 

all<00:05:25.790> right<00:05:25.970> now<00:05:26.120> that<00:05:26.330> it's<00:05:26.450> been<00:05:26.630> extracted

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
all right now that it's been extracted

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.640 
all right now that it's been extracted
fully<00:05:28.060> we're<00:05:29.060> going<00:05:29.270> to<00:05:29.420> be<00:05:29.510> looking<00:05:29.690> at<00:05:30.080> the

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
fully we're going to be looking at the

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.010 
fully we're going to be looking at the
outcome<00:05:31.070> of<00:05:31.100> it<00:05:31.340> so<00:05:31.670> i<00:05:31.700> got<00:05:31.970> my<00:05:32.000> normal<00:05:32.600> map<00:05:32.780> in

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
outcome of it so i got my normal map in

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.050 
outcome of it so i got my normal map in
my<00:05:33.110> skull<00:05:33.410> OC<00:05:34.040> seat<00:05:34.280> if<00:05:34.550> if<00:05:35.210> if<00:05:35.840> you<00:05:36.410> look<00:05:36.650> at<00:05:36.860> it

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
my skull OC seat if if if you look at it

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.500 
my skull OC seat if if if you look at it
let's<00:05:38.060> uncheck<00:05:38.450> this<00:05:39.200> box<00:05:39.260> I<00:05:40.150> don't<00:05:41.150> we<00:05:41.210> go<00:05:41.360> and

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
let's uncheck this box I don't we go and

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.080 
let's uncheck this box I don't we go and
check<00:05:41.690> it<00:05:41.750> back<00:05:42.070> you<00:05:43.070> can<00:05:43.250> see<00:05:43.400> all<00:05:43.430> the<00:05:43.580> detail

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
check it back you can see all the detail

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.000 
check it back you can see all the detail
and<00:05:44.300> the<00:05:44.420> ambient<00:05:44.960> occlusion<00:05:45.140> kind<00:05:45.710> of<00:05:45.800> just

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
and the ambient occlusion kind of just

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.930 
and the ambient occlusion kind of just
strengthens<00:05:46.700> that<00:05:46.880> detail<00:05:47.270> with<00:05:47.600> the<00:05:47.750> black

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
strengthens that detail with the black

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:54.070 
strengthens that detail with the black
very<00:05:49.940> very<00:05:50.240> nice<00:05:51.460> now<00:05:52.460> let's<00:05:53.390> go<00:05:53.570> look<00:05:53.750> at<00:05:53.930> the

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
very very nice now let's go look at the

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.440 
very very nice now let's go look at the
folder<00:05:54.350> that<00:05:55.010> this<00:05:55.280> exported<00:05:55.940> into<00:05:58.180> if<00:05:59.180> we<00:05:59.330> go

00:05:59.440 --> 00:05:59.450 
folder that this exported into if we go

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:04.300 
folder that this exported into if we go
to<00:05:59.510> Dropbox<00:06:00.520> work<00:06:01.520> in<00:06:01.670> progress<00:06:02.200> skull<00:06:03.310> here's

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
to Dropbox work in progress skull here's

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:11.710 
to Dropbox work in progress skull here's
my<00:06:04.520> normal<00:06:05.060> map<00:06:05.270> and<00:06:06.490> occ<00:06:07.490> map<00:06:08.590> good<00:06:10.720> alright

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 
my normal map and occ map good alright

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.740 
my normal map and occ map good alright
so<00:06:11.960> the<00:06:12.080> next<00:06:12.110> thing<00:06:12.500> I<00:06:12.710> want<00:06:12.950> to<00:06:13.040> do<00:06:13.250> in<00:06:13.750> the

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
so the next thing I want to do in the

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.630 
so the next thing I want to do in the
next<00:06:14.930> video<00:06:15.290> is<00:06:15.620> it's<00:06:16.100> go<00:06:16.280> through<00:06:16.520> the

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:16.640 
next video is it's go through the

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.150 
next video is it's go through the
conversion<00:06:17.360> and<00:06:17.630> the<00:06:17.980> addition<00:06:18.980> of

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
conversion and the addition of

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.730 
conversion and the addition of
additional<00:06:20.090> things<00:06:20.330> like<00:06:20.600> let's<00:06:21.020> say<00:06:21.110> surface

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
additional things like let's say surface

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.000 
additional things like let's say surface
noise<00:06:21.980> for<00:06:22.460> this<00:06:22.640> how<00:06:23.540> do<00:06:24.020> we<00:06:24.290> dictate<00:06:24.560> that

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.010 
noise for this how do we dictate that

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.400 
noise for this how do we dictate that
surface<00:06:25.580> noise<00:06:25.790> how<00:06:26.510> do<00:06:26.570> we<00:06:26.750> add<00:06:26.960> another

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:27.410 
surface noise how do we add another

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.100 
surface noise how do we add another
normal<00:06:27.770> map<00:06:28.100> just<00:06:28.460> in<00:06:28.640> case<00:06:28.850> you<00:06:29.060> need<00:06:29.330> it<00:06:29.360> okay

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 
normal map just in case you need it okay
