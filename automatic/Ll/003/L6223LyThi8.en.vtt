 take me until the game goal arrives 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.120
 now it seems to me that this track knew what 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.480
 I wanted to do but I did not know how 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.340
 do it and the league also won the league 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.440

 getting because the saprissa there is no 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.790
 doubt that it was the team that proposed that 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.970
 He had arrived alternatives to fish 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.270
 area that he finished but in plays like 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.270
 these 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.660
 they are vital to take better 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:30.789
 decisions there we see that intervention of 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.829
 mega driver that maybe server power 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.829
 generate something else outside obtained 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.200
 Y 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.630
 to establish the assistance that the 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.210
 scientific dessert the good closure in the 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.130
 bora for the time in minute 46 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.750
 although the league had the ball to the area 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.760
 had a little more presence near 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.620
 from the saprissa area in a cafe 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.710
 dangerous saprissa if you were creating 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.210
 centers and looking for combinations this 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.130
 real pizza that 20 in all of that 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.080
 you have to be honest that your team that 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.060
 It was utmost to try to 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.460
 offend his rival obviously the 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.010
 competitive part but 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.890
 with more will with less ideas up 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.270
 that finally the move that came 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.270
 tipped the scales in their favor were 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.040
 centers were auctions were opportunities 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.220
 that did not curdle and when it seemed that 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.190
 everything was going to be done to zero came that without 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.560
 offensive to the league and saprissa finds 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.259
 the key to get second addition 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.409
 surprise prize has been higher than 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.050
 red and white team says this goal that 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.759
 establishes the difference almost reaches the 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.970
 objective oscar ramirez says with the 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.670
 impact but the one that bets more on 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.500
 attack always counts one option and here 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.970
 the tur is applied that soccer does not 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.830
