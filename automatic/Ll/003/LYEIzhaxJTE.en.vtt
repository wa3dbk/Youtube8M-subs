 chapels 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:41.510
 Well, we want Madrid in general 

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:43.370
 the one project is the project that 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.530
 comisarió next to javier rubí name in 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.530

 in this edition it has two programs 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.600
 the general destined to the national scope 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.519
 and international and one project that 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.219
 includes eight projects in format 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.680
 called alone south these consists of 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.860
 that each of these projects shows 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.590
 the work of a unique artist 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.899
 project is a curated section 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.619
 within the fair this means that 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:18.720
 we are facing a field where a 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.250
 team of curators in dialogue with the 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.800
 artists and with the galleries that 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.009
 represent the artists have 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.659
 established some pieces or some projects 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.240
 in single project formats is to say every 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.240
 booth has an artist with a project 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.619
 specific to this fair and what is 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.409
 pretends it's mostly within a 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.909
 scope so so complex and so moved 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.090
 as it is an art fair one more area 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.679
 reflective a space 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.200
 let's say different and that through the 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:47.730
 The work of the curators modulates the 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.220
 experience 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.170
 towards the visitor in a more 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.570
 easy we could tell the team 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.520
 drill weapon organization emphasizes 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.500
 more dynamic fair models and 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.840
 close with the intention of adapting to 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.990
 the current needs of gallerists and 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.990
