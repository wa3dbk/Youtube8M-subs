all right great start that's the spirit
doramin<00:01:02.140> what<00:01:02.500> popped<00:01:02.860> up<00:01:03.160> than<00:01:03.370> usual<00:01:03.989> yeah

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.200 
doramin what popped up than usual yeah
by<00:01:05.320> adding<00:01:05.650> a<00:01:05.740> glass-like<00:01:06.040> surface<00:01:06.550> to<00:01:07.120> the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
by adding a glass-like surface to the

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.380 
by adding a glass-like surface to the
angle<00:01:07.660> of<00:01:07.780> the<00:01:07.900> slope<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:09.310> allows<00:01:09.580> Pegasus<00:01:10.180> to

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
angle of the slope it allows Pegasus to

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.090 
angle of the slope it allows Pegasus to
accelerate<00:01:10.930> like<00:01:11.110> the<00:01:11.260> bank<00:01:11.560> of<00:01:11.770> a<00:01:11.860> racetrack

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
accelerate like the bank of a racetrack

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.859 
accelerate like the bank of a racetrack
does<00:01:12.670> for<00:01:12.970> a<00:01:13.000> racecar

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:19.080 

let's<00:01:17.439> see<00:01:17.649> the<00:01:17.799> power<00:01:18.070> of<00:01:18.219> the<00:01:18.429> Pegasus<00:01:18.939> you

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
let's see the power of the Pegasus you

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.569 
let's see the power of the Pegasus you
inherited<00:01:19.570> from<00:01:19.630> your<00:01:19.810> father<00:01:20.140> show<00:01:21.070> it<00:01:21.250> to<00:01:21.429> me

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:21.579 
inherited from your father show it to me

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:28.380 
inherited from your father show it to me
Gingka

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:42.290 

Oh

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.350 

moving<00:01:43.300> so<00:01:43.570> fast<00:01:43.870> I<00:01:44.320> told<00:01:45.010> you<00:01:45.280> this<00:01:45.880> is<00:01:46.120> the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
moving so fast I told you this is the

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.700 
moving so fast I told you this is the
Green<00:01:46.750> Hades

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
Green Hades

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.480 
Green Hades
at<00:01:48.070> least<00:01:48.460> her<00:01:49.120> Ginga<00:01:49.690> it<00:01:49.930> is

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
at least her Ginga it is

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.300 
at least her Ginga it is
I<00:01:51.520> am<00:01:52.150> undefeated<00:01:52.570> in<00:01:53.020> this<00:01:53.230> stadium<00:01:53.710> in<00:01:54.040> all

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
I am undefeated in this stadium in all

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.880 
I am undefeated in this stadium in all
the<00:01:54.520> times<00:01:54.790> we've<00:01:55.120> battled<00:01:55.480> here<00:01:55.900> Ginga<00:01:56.710> has

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
the times we've battled here Ginga has

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.880 
the times we've battled here Ginga has
never<00:01:57.220> won<00:01:57.580> not<00:01:58.060> even<00:01:58.540> one<00:01:58.780> time<00:01:59.110> you're

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
never won not even one time you're

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:08.870 
never won not even one time you're
kidding<00:02:00.520> that<00:02:01.150> can't<00:02:01.570> be<00:02:01.690> true<00:02:04.260> now<00:02:05.260> I<00:02:05.290> get<00:02:05.710> it

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.640 

the<00:02:09.880> attack<00:02:10.179> power<00:02:10.420> is<00:02:10.630> nowhere<00:02:11.110> near<00:02:11.170> high

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
the attack power is nowhere near high

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.860 
the attack power is nowhere near high
enough<00:02:14.250> there's<00:02:15.250> no<00:02:15.430> traction<00:02:15.790> see<00:02:16.270> the

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
enough there's no traction see the

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.840 
enough there's no traction see the
high-speed<00:02:17.080> is<00:02:17.590> only<00:02:17.770> because<00:02:18.190> it's<00:02:18.340> sliding

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
high-speed is only because it's sliding

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.490 
high-speed is only because it's sliding
over<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.120> glassy<00:02:19.600> surface<00:02:19.840> but<00:02:20.320> there's

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
over the glassy surface but there's

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.250 
over the glassy surface but there's
actually<00:02:20.920> no<00:02:21.100> real<00:02:21.340> force<00:02:21.700> behind<00:02:21.970> it<00:02:22.390> so<00:02:22.960> this

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
actually no real force behind it so this

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.140 
actually no real force behind it so this
stadium<00:02:23.860> must<00:02:24.070> make<00:02:24.310> attack<00:02:24.670> types<00:02:24.970> like

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
stadium must make attack types like

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.240 
stadium must make attack types like
Pegasus<00:02:25.690> much<00:02:25.930> less<00:02:26.170> effective<00:02:26.470> which<00:02:26.950> means

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
Pegasus much less effective which means

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.910 
Pegasus much less effective which means
the<00:02:27.430> defensive<00:02:28.120> type<00:02:28.360> Ares<00:02:28.900> is<00:02:29.320> way<00:02:29.620> more

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
the defensive type Ares is way more

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.450 
the defensive type Ares is way more
useful<00:02:30.190> here<00:02:30.700> hey<00:02:31.330> that's<00:02:31.750> not<00:02:32.020> fair<00:02:32.440> oh<00:02:32.830> isn't

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
useful here hey that's not fair oh isn't

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.180 
useful here hey that's not fair oh isn't
it<00:02:33.700> how<00:02:34.090> do<00:02:34.150> you<00:02:34.300> figure<00:02:34.540> that<00:02:34.690> I'll<00:02:35.500> tell<00:02:35.920> ya

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
it how do you figure that I'll tell ya

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.220 
it how do you figure that I'll tell ya
what's<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.880> disadvantage<00:02:37.239> from<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.959> stadium

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
what's the disadvantage from the stadium

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.350 
what's the disadvantage from the stadium
it<00:02:38.590> isn't<00:02:38.830> a<00:02:38.860> worthy<00:02:39.220> match<00:02:39.430> do<00:02:40.000> you<00:02:40.090> really

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
it isn't a worthy match do you really

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.610 
it isn't a worthy match do you really
think<00:02:40.630> so<00:02:40.840> my<00:02:41.050> friend

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
think so my friend

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.949 
think so my friend
I<00:02:41.739> don't<00:02:42.400> think<00:02:42.489> Ginga<00:02:43.120> would<00:02:43.300> agree<00:02:43.600> with<00:02:43.750> you

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
I don't think Ginga would agree with you

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.170 
I don't think Ginga would agree with you
winning<00:02:44.650> means<00:02:44.860> more<00:02:45.220> cuz<00:02:45.550> it's<00:02:45.700> a<00:02:45.790> difficult

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
winning means more cuz it's a difficult

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.199 
winning means more cuz it's a difficult
Stadium<00:02:49.650> have<00:02:50.650> you<00:02:50.800> all<00:02:51.010> forgotten<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.790> windy

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
Stadium have you all forgotten the windy

stadium
maile<00:02:53.800> old<00:02:53.980> had<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.340> advantage<00:02:54.850> there

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
maile old had the advantage there

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.390 
maile old had the advantage there
because<00:02:55.360> of<00:02:55.480> wind<00:02:55.720> but<00:02:56.440> Gingka<00:02:56.739> never<00:02:57.100> backed

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
because of wind but Gingka never backed

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.060 
because of wind but Gingka never backed
down<00:02:57.570> right<00:02:58.950> that's<00:02:59.950> true<00:03:00.330> no<00:03:01.330> matter<00:03:01.360> what
