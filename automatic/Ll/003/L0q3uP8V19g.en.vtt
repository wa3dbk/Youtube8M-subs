00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:08.010
 we are in Verona for an event 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.870
 career oncology: top experts 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.380
 of the industry for a tumor day 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.150
 to the kidney 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.830
 let's talk about therapy with the teacher 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.839
 chorus aster bank of san camillo 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.240
 forlanini of rome authority of fame 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.859
 world teacher in this field 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.570
 what to do first when the 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.680
 early diagnosis of the tumor still in 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.660
 initial phase when doing the diagnosis 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.699
 early renal cell carcinoma patients 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.009
 better things than turning to a urologist 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.010
 to have surgery 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.020
 and if the tumor had already advanced 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.270
 locally there is already metastasis 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.520
 first intervention patients with 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.559
 renal carcinoma also commented yes la 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.450
 first worthy of intervention today as today 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.239
 if one does not have a clinical study and the 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.570
 nephrectomy and this has been seen in 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.420
 years where I studied my own fracts 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.199
 metastatic patients in the field of 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.989
 cytokines and here we do not know now 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.489
 several of these years of cytokines e 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.320
 it seems that the flaw of these new ones 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.990
 molecular and minor target agents on 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.930
 Primary who only halfway there if you 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.840
 today two studies are in progress 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:19.200
 a and derivatives is called short 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:23.009
 time where patients began to do a 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.950
 track counts that has nephrectomy towards a 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.780
 effect before and after that there is another 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.840
 similar study in france but today how 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.570
 today without having knowledge of one 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.640
 study if possible to do mine 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.420
 shatter and then treat patients for 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.369
 metastasis and then in the second line 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.340
 after my effect if they recur 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.710
 over metastasis tumor recurred 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.500
 second line would be the first line of 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.159
 drugs now and we talked about 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.200
 drugs for the first line of therapies 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.719
 therapy algorithm this morning and there 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.259
 we said that patients in first 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.540
 line of drugs after from nephrectomy to 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.370
 patients who have a component or not 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.080
 of clear cells 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.260
 We want to train color I 've been in 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:26.780
 very studied much more patients with 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:26.780
 clear commented accent from years ago 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.690
 now we have with every fan or different e 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.270
 much more 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.950
 over two years and now when there is one 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.010
 sequence of patient drugs can 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.810
 also to live these much longer 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.230
 all the drugs he mentioned 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.190
 they are not all equivalent 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.050
 equivalent 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.780
 we presented the results today 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.780
 of a study called compound in 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.810
 which we did a study of no 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.290
 inferiority to see if it is not 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.110
 inferior to united and what was 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.120
 seen in this study one can do one 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.400
 study of non- inferiority broken that 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.260
 a little more things for example a 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.510
 quality of life gain for 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.100
 example this was the purpose is target 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.530
 of this study to see if it was not 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.720
 lower is almost a difference both in 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.610
 safety or quality of life 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.709
 in this study that head to head with 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.959
 more than 1,000 patients with mad or like 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.840
 towards Sunnis but has been seen that not 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.489
 there were no differences 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.709
 quantitative in terms of progress e 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.780
 there were no pure survival 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.360
 differences in terms of survival 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.100
 global there was no difference 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.920
 important among a respawn sa ha 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.380
 also responded patients who dealt with 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.500
 Pezzopane has been answered more 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.750
 important but still similar as it was 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.550
 advanced than on united to have stronger 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.400
 you see crazy from the point of view I have 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.500
 replied was not shown so with 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.440
 two very similar drugs in terms of 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.570
 survival answers has been seen in 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.519
 this study with four types of 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.400
 different questionnaires that surely 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:08.420
 they can drink better torate than join 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:13.549
 nor in terms of fatigue syndrome 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:15.750
 mucositis operations also of taste and 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.420
 Sunni snow was better than crazy for the 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.580
 in terms of raising of 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.100
 liver function by that 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:24.170
 these drugs were very similar with 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.900
 a better quality of life for mad 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.940
 as seen in the kishin study 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.050
 previous which is a study based on 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:34.850
 study patients preferences 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.070
 double blind in which patients took 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:40.430
 be mad in the wake of Sunnis le 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.560
 allowed later not knowing that 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.900
 of the first picture of the second they did 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.960
 their choice and for patients 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:51.110
 the choice is much more frequent for 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:54.140
 reasons for fatigues with crazy that anyway 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.180
 putting together two studies we have a 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:59.390
 drug that is found better than 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.490
 patients with results very similar to 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.230
 beyond the options already available there 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.330
 are other molecules besides processors 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:08.960
 promising in the testing phase 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:12.860
 I would say approaches and are interesting 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:16.040
 old things are sometimes new areas 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:19.190
 new and there are new therapies based 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.900
 de miro anti pd therapy one for example 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:25.400
 which one of the most interesting drugs that 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.630
 we will go to study in the future that 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.640
 message feels like giving to patients 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.320
 until recently not long ago 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.180
 the only option available at 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.530
 There are many more surgeries now 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.450
 have improved the prognosis that 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.670
 message can give for the future me 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.560
 I think the future is fantastic in 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.750
 america the set of were found 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.420
 new drugs for kidney cancer 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:46.250
 we have 5 here in Italy but now gradually 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:49.610
 The plan we have drugs 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.470
 available and we know a little more than 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.990
 their toxicity profile and how 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.660
 handle toxicities and it certainly is 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:59.090
 better today as today than if one has a 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.980
 Metastatic renal tumor is not one 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.310
 desperate situation and how it was a bit of 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.310
 Years ago
