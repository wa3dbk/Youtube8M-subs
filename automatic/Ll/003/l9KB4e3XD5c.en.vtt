00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.360
 hello and welcome to your reports 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.070
 minutes before January we'll see 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.920
 how to turn a video into a third 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.780
 in 16/9 so first I will make you 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.780
 a presentation of a video in 4/3 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.050
 so you can find that on a 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.750
 video in 4/3 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.110
 we have black rectangles on them 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:50.590
 sides to the Princess of Vienna 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.800
 have black rectangles at the top and in 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.730
 low 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.730
 little demonstration 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.930
 this 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.760
 so the very simple method for this 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.230
 transformation without distorting the image and 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.700
 without cutting the bosses or down 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.670
 you will take a video in 4/3 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.810
 you're going to right click and you 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:31.470
 go to edit footage is there we go 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.560
 take an interest in the aspect ratio width 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.190
 height in worse she so the share of 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.260
 batches in use in intake 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.930
 trial me so go there you go 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:47.100
 to conform to you will choose one 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:51.060
 take and take a 16 9th PAL DVD that 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.759
 do you do not hockey do you go 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.110
 review his opinion the hours that the video 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.340
 is stretched but we come to worry 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.080
 not soon we'll see that it's all over 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.460
 just do it 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.119
 so you select your video you 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.270
 have transformed 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.280
 you put it on your timeline and the 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.470
 new window appears and you 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.840
 asks if you want to keep 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.340
 settings or change the settings you 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.590
 do not keep so in the 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.000
 canvas you see that your video a 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.800
 the whole window 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.160
 there are no two rectangles 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:31.510
 two black on the sides so here we 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.510
 will do a little reading essay 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.530
 so now it is now him to have 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.880
 we black rectangle if you listen on 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.350
 is there indeed a video in 16/9 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.580
 you can see a starting image coming from 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.980
 forms and there is no debate of 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.100
 quality have little or if there is one 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.300
 it's very very rough and that's it 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.840
 that's all they had everything 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:11.790
 that he did thank you for your 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.790
 attention and it takes every time
