make a video and it could maybe show

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.550 
make a video and it could maybe show
other<00:00:13.769> people<00:00:13.830> out<00:00:14.160> there<00:00:14.190> as<00:00:14.549> well<00:00:14.820> so<00:00:15.560> the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
over it so /nc be will open up like a

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.250 
over it so /nc be will open up like a
list<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.859> commands<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.719> lets<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.899> change

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
basically what I just did with it was

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.750 
basically what I just did with it was
move<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.780> little<00:01:09.930> down<00:01:10.680> here<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.189> like<00:01:11.549> it's

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
move it a little down here it like it's

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.780 
move it a little down here it like it's
default<00:01:12.240> up<00:01:12.450> here<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.710> it's<00:01:13.890> kind<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
default up here so it's kind of in the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.130 
default up here so it's kind of in the
way<00:01:14.909> your<00:01:15.090> screen<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.720> moved<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.110> down

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
way your screen so I just moved it down

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.810 
way your screen so I just moved it down
here<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:17.659> then<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.860> made<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.250> where<00:01:20.520> my

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
here and then I made it so where my

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.560 
here and then I made it so where my
fifth<00:01:21.060> coma<00:01:21.330> point<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.810> like<00:01:23.570> obviously

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
fifth coma point is like obviously

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.080 
fifth coma point is like obviously
different<00:01:24.960> or<00:01:25.619> like<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.830> color<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.790> stands

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
different or like a color that stands

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.420 
different or like a color that stands
out<00:01:27.330> from<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.540> first<00:01:27.810> four<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:28.979> can<00:01:29.189> tell

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
out from the first four so I can tell

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.310 
out from the first four so I can tell
like<00:01:29.850> just<00:01:30.119> easily<00:01:30.509> even<00:01:30.720> though<00:01:30.900> it's<00:01:31.079> it's

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
like just easily even though it's it's

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.870 
like just easily even though it's it's
you<00:01:31.560> can<00:01:31.680> see<00:01:31.710> it's<00:01:31.950> larger<00:01:32.400> than<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.670> first

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
you can see it's larger than the first

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.120 
you can see it's larger than the first
four<00:01:33.060> combo<00:01:33.390> points<00:01:33.689> it's<00:01:33.900> it's<00:01:34.860> also<00:01:35.009> a

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
four combo points it's it's also a

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.740 
four combo points it's it's also a
different<00:01:35.400> color<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.240> do<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.540> by

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
different color and you do that by

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.100 
different color and you do that by
typing<00:01:37.140> slash<00:01:37.590> NCB<00:01:38.159> change<00:01:39.030> color<00:01:41.750> this<00:01:42.750> first

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
typing slash NCB change color this first

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.440 
typing slash NCB change color this first
couple<00:01:43.439> point<00:01:43.619> would<00:01:43.890> be<00:01:43.920> slash<00:01:44.549> NC<00:01:44.939> be<00:01:45.090> change

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
couple point would be slash NC be change

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.190 
couple point would be slash NC be change
color<00:01:45.659> 1<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:47.159> would<00:01:47.280> be<00:01:47.340> 2<00:01:47.430> 3<00:01:48.060> 4<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.689> 5<00:01:48.720> so

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
color 1 this would be 2 3 4 and 5 so

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.780 
color 1 this would be 2 3 4 and 5 so
what<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.500> want<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.710> do<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:49.920> 5<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.399> change<00:01:50.640> it

pretty much it a few more things about

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.470 
pretty much it a few more things about
the<00:02:45.270> add-on<00:02:45.600> is<00:02:45.780> uh<00:02:46.910> just<00:02:47.910> get<00:02:48.030> a<00:02:48.060> common<00:02:48.360> point

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
the add-on is uh just get a common point

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.040 
the add-on is uh just get a common point
up<00:02:48.660> real<00:02:49.170> fast<00:02:49.350> so<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:49.590> can<00:02:49.680> see<00:02:49.970> I<00:02:50.970> think<00:02:51.660> this

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
up real fast so you can see I think this

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.650 
up real fast so you can see I think this
I've<00:02:52.350> never<00:02:52.530> used<00:02:52.740> this<00:02:53.280> command<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:54.060> think

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
I've never used this command I think

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.660 
I've never used this command I think
this<00:02:54.780> is<00:02:54.900> this<00:02:55.080> if<00:02:55.380> you<00:02:55.770> have<00:02:55.950> more<00:02:56.340> than<00:02:56.460> one

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
this is this if you have more than one

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.820 
this is this if you have more than one
character<00:02:56.850> and<00:02:57.330> you<00:02:57.810> using<00:02:58.110> this<00:02:58.200> add-on<00:02:58.440> like

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
character and you using this add-on like

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.530 
character and you using this add-on like
because<00:02:59.070> other<00:02:59.370> other<00:02:59.730> classes<00:03:00.150> can<00:03:00.180> use<00:03:00.390> this

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
because other other classes can use this

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.050 
because other other classes can use this
add-on<00:03:00.720> like<00:03:01.080> a<00:03:01.400> warlocks<00:03:02.400> can<00:03:02.580> use<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:02.850> to

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
add-on like a warlocks can use it to

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.540 
add-on like a warlocks can use it to
track<00:03:03.540> their<00:03:03.720> combo<00:03:04.020> I<00:03:04.230> mean<00:03:04.530> uh<00:03:04.560> soul<00:03:05.070> shards

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
track their combo I mean uh soul shards

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.090 
track their combo I mean uh soul shards
holy<00:03:05.850> paladin's<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:06.570> I<00:03:07.260> mean<00:03:07.470> all<00:03:07.620> paladin's

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
holy paladin's and I mean all paladin's

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.400 
holy paladin's and I mean all paladin's
can<00:03:08.340> use<00:03:08.460> it<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.820> track<00:03:09.150> their<00:03:09.390> holy<00:03:09.900> power<00:03:10.140> and

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
can use it to track their holy power and

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.580 
can use it to track their holy power and
then<00:03:11.130> rogues<00:03:11.910> cobble<00:03:12.690> points<00:03:12.990> and<00:03:13.170> for<00:03:13.500> Road

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
then rogues cobble points and for Road

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.500 
then rogues cobble points and for Road
route<00:03:13.770> combo<00:03:14.070> points<00:03:14.400> so<00:03:14.610> I<00:03:14.820> think<00:03:15.030> that's<00:03:15.360> if

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
route combo points so I think that's if

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.670 
route combo points so I think that's if
you<00:03:15.570> have<00:03:15.660> more<00:03:15.840> than<00:03:15.960> one<00:03:16.110> character<00:03:16.500> and

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
you have more than one character and

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.860 
you have more than one character and
you're<00:03:17.490> using<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.880> add-on<00:03:18.030> on<00:03:18.330> multiple

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
you're using the add-on on multiple

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.710 
you're using the add-on on multiple
tunes<00:03:19.110> and<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:20.430> unlock<00:03:20.910> so<00:03:21.210> we'll<00:03:21.420> just<00:03:21.600> do

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
tunes and the unlock so we'll just do

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.370 
tunes and the unlock so we'll just do
that<00:03:21.840> real<00:03:22.050> fast

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
that real fast

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.600 
that real fast

and then I can't move it anymore and the
other<00:04:18.000> thing<00:04:18.299> is<00:04:18.570> the<00:04:19.530> scale<00:04:19.830> you<00:04:20.130> can<00:04:20.280> make<00:04:20.430> it

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
other thing is the scale you can make it

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.600 
other thing is the scale you can make it
bigger<00:04:20.790> or<00:04:21.109> larger<00:04:22.109> bigger<00:04:23.070> or<00:04:23.190> smaller<00:04:23.310> I

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
bigger or larger bigger or smaller I

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.990

mean<00:04:25.400> but<00:04:26.400> I

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
mean but I

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.490 
mean but I
I use<00:04:27.450> mine<00:04:27.660> a<00:04:27.690> default<00:04:28.230> size<00:04:28.490> it<00:04:29.490> varies<00:04:29.850> from

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
I use mine a default size it varies from

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.710 
I use mine a default size it varies from
0.3<00:04:31.500> to<00:04:31.620> 2.0<00:04:32.130> so<00:04:32.700> you<00:04:32.760> would<00:04:33.000> just<00:04:33.030> press<00:04:33.390> flush

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
0.3 to 2.0 so you would just press flush

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.660 
0.3 to 2.0 so you would just press flush
and<00:04:33.900> see<00:04:34.080> B<00:04:34.350> scale<00:04:34.860> and<00:04:35.160> then<00:04:35.250> whatever<00:04:35.460> you

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
and see B scale and then whatever you

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.220 
and see B scale and then whatever you
want<00:04:37.460> you<00:04:38.460> would<00:04:38.580> type<00:04:38.730> 1.7<00:04:39.480> if<00:04:39.570> you<00:04:39.660> wanted<00:04:39.990> to

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
want you would type 1.7 if you wanted to

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
want you would type 1.7 if you wanted to
point<00:04:40.470> oh<00:04:40.590> you<00:04:41.400> know<00:04:41.520> 0.5<00:04:42.390> whatever<00:04:43.250> you'd

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
point oh you know 0.5 whatever you'd

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.240 
point oh you know 0.5 whatever you'd
like<00:04:44.540> I<00:04:45.540> haven't<00:04:46.500> messed<00:04:46.620> around<00:04:46.800> with<00:04:47.070> the

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
like I haven't messed around with the

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.100 
like I haven't messed around with the
anchor<00:04:47.940> point<00:04:48.180> and<00:04:49.010> then<00:04:50.150> /nc<00:04:51.150> be<00:04:51.450> reset<00:04:51.900> would

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
anchor point and then /nc be reset would

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.430 
anchor point and then /nc be reset would
just<00:04:52.290> put<00:04:52.440> it<00:04:52.530> back<00:04:52.620> to<00:04:52.800> default<00:04:54.260> like<00:04:55.260> when

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
just put it back to default like when

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.170 
just put it back to default like when
you<00:04:55.530> got<00:04:55.740> that<00:04:55.920> on<00:04:56.220> and<00:04:56.430> you<00:04:56.730> haven't<00:04:56.970> touched

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
you got that on and you haven't touched

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.750 
you got that on and you haven't touched
it<00:04:57.420> yet<00:04:57.510> so<00:04:57.840> if<00:04:58.320> you<00:04:58.800> mess<00:04:59.010> up<00:04:59.040> or<00:04:59.460> you<00:04:59.640> just

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
it yet so if you mess up or you just

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.310 
it yet so if you mess up or you just
want<00:04:59.970> to<00:05:00.030> put<00:05:00.300> it<00:05:00.390> back<00:05:00.450> to<00:05:00.630> normal<00:05:00.780> you<00:05:01.050> can<00:05:01.080> do

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
want to put it back to normal you can do

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.200 
want to put it back to normal you can do
that<00:05:01.470> or<00:05:02.010> you<00:05:02.190> can<00:05:02.310> just<00:05:02.370> you<00:05:02.640> know<00:05:02.790> do<00:05:03.090> it

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
that or you can just you know do it

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.730 
that or you can just you know do it
manually<00:05:03.510> I<00:05:03.780> don't<00:05:04.050> think<00:05:04.200> it's<00:05:04.290> that<00:05:04.350> hard<00:05:04.470> to

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
manually I don't think it's that hard to

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.190 
manually I don't think it's that hard to
edit<00:05:04.830> it's<00:05:05.580> a<00:05:05.640> pretty<00:05:05.970> simple<00:05:06.510> add-on<00:05:06.810> and

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
edit it's a pretty simple add-on and

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.730 
edit it's a pretty simple add-on and
it's<00:05:07.470> pretty<00:05:08.270> efficient<00:05:09.270> too<00:05:09.390> I<00:05:09.419> like<00:05:09.720> it<00:05:09.960> it's

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
it's pretty efficient too I like it it's

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.040 
it's pretty efficient too I like it it's
a<00:05:10.950> an<00:05:11.220> easy<00:05:11.490> way<00:05:11.760> to<00:05:11.790> keep<00:05:12.419> track<00:05:12.630> of<00:05:12.870> fewer

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
a an easy way to keep track of fewer

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.000 
a an easy way to keep track of fewer
comma<00:05:13.290> points<00:05:13.680> and<00:05:13.860> holy<00:05:14.400> power<00:05:15.000> and<00:05:15.470> so<00:05:16.470> soul

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
comma points and holy power and so soul

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.140 
comma points and holy power and so soul
shards<00:05:17.490> and<00:05:17.760> all<00:05:18.330> that<00:05:18.510> good<00:05:18.690> stuff<00:05:18.720> so<00:05:19.470> um<00:05:20.150> you

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
shards and all that good stuff so um you

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.600 
shards and all that good stuff so um you
know<00:05:21.300> it's<00:05:21.780> a<00:05:22.080> good<00:05:22.470> add-on<00:05:22.770> I<00:05:22.980> recommend<00:05:23.430> it

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
know it's a good add-on I recommend it

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.180 
know it's a good add-on I recommend it
but<00:05:24.390> you<00:05:24.540> know<00:05:24.720> it's<00:05:25.290> I<00:05:25.560> think<00:05:25.770> it's<00:05:25.860> more<00:05:25.980> of<00:05:26.100> a

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
but you know it's I think it's more of a

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.920 
but you know it's I think it's more of a
personal<00:05:26.669> preference<00:05:26.910> because<00:05:27.360> I<00:05:27.390> think<00:05:27.750> some

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
personal preference because I think some

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.450 
personal preference because I think some
people<00:05:28.230> just<00:05:28.440> like<00:05:28.650> going<00:05:28.860> off<00:05:29.070> these<00:05:29.250> blue
