00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.080 

sir<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:13.769> guess<00:03:14.159> you<00:03:14.310> could<00:03:14.340> lower<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.819> settings

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
sir I guess you could lower the settings

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.020 
sir I guess you could lower the settings
a<00:03:15.390> little<00:03:15.629> bit<00:03:15.780> if<00:03:16.250> this<00:03:17.250> time<00:03:17.489> right<00:03:17.730> is<00:03:17.909> an

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
a little bit if this time right is an

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.710 
a little bit if this time right is an
acceptable<00:03:18.510> for<00:03:19.610> but<00:03:20.610> I<00:03:20.640> have<00:03:21.060> no<00:03:21.209> idea<00:03:21.330> what

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
acceptable for but I have no idea what

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.869 
acceptable for but I have no idea what
this<00:03:21.840> would<00:03:22.019> be<00:03:22.049> like<00:03:22.200> in<00:03:22.590> raids<00:03:22.890> like<00:03:23.459> massive
