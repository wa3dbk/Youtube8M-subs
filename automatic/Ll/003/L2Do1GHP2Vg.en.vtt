00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 an activity you can do with 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:09.630
 cuba that involves more reasoning right 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.280
 can there be any function whatsoever 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.960
 combinatorial analysis thing 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.520
 is for example you ask the students 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.230
 described the movement of the body then 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.930
 You're going to draw a car in a way. 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.150
 so the story becomes easier this way 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.210
 to visualize what happens right? 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.349
 so I want to get at this result 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.820
 Here're so as to give accounts 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.050
 write this the simplest way 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.480
 more direct and write what is and you 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.809
 have to explain to them the 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.170
 movements, right but I do not need 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:50.430
 to do just that, I can do it 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.320
 example do that tiny one and then 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.910
 do what we call the movement 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.199
 of the cube rotation nÃ© 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.969
 would the boss here also come in the same 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.340
 state 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:09.380
 And then I can do a lot of things 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:16.830
 I can do for example I can make one and 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:20.640
 I can do an emmy rotating okubo 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:26.009
 here also with the boss and make a l 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:32.700
 the same thing also has several ways 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:35.189
 after giving an Egyptian in the 12 do a l gives 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.200
 a y 2 is also there 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.570
 we usually do is make a 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.659
 joking then someone gives the first 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.990
 move a simple 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.299
 okay and then the next person has to take a 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.310
 another way of doing the same thing and 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.500
 No one can go until someone can not 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.250
 more do a different thing 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.979
 just can not do things that cancel 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.469
 you make an r line and then make a 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.979
 r 2 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:12.840
 have to put some limits not defined 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:14.670
 if it will do 11 of 28 11 12 of 22 is 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.720
 then the things you cancel can not 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.459
 but this rotational thing moves of 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.550
 side by side 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:29.910
 It's ok, and you can start with 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:31.920
 It's simpler and you'll be fine in 12 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.269
 movements for example already quite pain 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.870
 Of Head 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.870
