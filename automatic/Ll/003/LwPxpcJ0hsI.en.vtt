all right so here's a close-up look of
our<00:01:10.080> driftwood<00:01:10.590> fort<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:12.020> think<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.110> turned<00:01:13.290> out

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410

simple<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.790> build<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.649> just<00:01:19.649> brought<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.860> shovel

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
simple to build I just brought a shovel

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.600 
simple to build I just brought a shovel
and<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:21.810> just<00:01:22.050> dug<00:01:22.290> in<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.649> Center<00:01:23.070> pole<00:01:23.310> about

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
and I just dug in this Center pole about

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.600 
and I just dug in this Center pole about
three<00:01:24.030> feet<00:01:24.270> down<00:01:24.509> into<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.899> sand<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.610> you

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
three feet down into the sand and you

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.790 
three feet down into the sand and you
find<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.970> nice<00:01:27.149> log<00:01:27.509> with<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.810> good<00:01:28.020> root<00:01:28.350> ball<00:01:28.560> on

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
find a nice log with a good root ball on

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.160 
find a nice log with a good root ball on
the<00:01:28.920> end<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.640> support<00:01:30.090> all<00:01:30.270> your<00:01:31.130> rafter<00:01:32.130> poles

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.600 
the end to support all your rafter poles
and<00:01:34.170> then<00:01:34.289> you<00:01:34.380> just<00:01:34.590> stack<00:01:34.950> them<00:01:35.100> up<00:01:35.250> but<00:01:35.490> it's

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
and then you just stack them up but it's

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.719 
and then you just stack them up but it's
really<00:01:35.850> solid<00:01:36.479> secure<00:01:37.429> you<00:01:38.429> don't<00:01:38.550> have<00:01:38.640> to

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
really solid secure you don't have to

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.210 
really solid secure you don't have to
worry<00:01:38.940> about<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.240> collapsing<00:01:39.810> on<00:01:39.959> kids<00:01:40.410> but<00:01:40.679> I

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
worry about it collapsing on kids but I

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.029 
worry about it collapsing on kids but I
did<00:01:41.490> use<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.729> few<00:01:42.289> six-inch<00:01:43.289> screws<00:01:43.649> just<00:01:43.679> to

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
did use a few six-inch screws just to

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.029 
did use a few six-inch screws just to
kind<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.310> hold<00:01:44.520> certain<00:01:44.940> ones<00:01:45.209> in<00:01:45.390> place<00:01:46.039> and

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
kind of hold certain ones in place and

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.889
