00:00:43.349 --> 00:00:43.359 
you guys my first like looks and

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:46.410 
you guys my first like looks and
thoughts<00:00:43.569> about<00:00:43.690> this<00:00:43.989> um<00:00:44.969> my<00:00:45.969> first<00:00:46.179> thought

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
thoughts about this um my first thought

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.270 
thoughts about this um my first thought
is<00:00:46.659> that<00:00:46.690> the<00:00:47.109> graphics<00:00:47.649> aren't<00:00:47.949> the<00:00:48.100> best

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
is that the graphics aren't the best

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.610 
is that the graphics aren't the best
they<00:00:48.670> look<00:00:48.999> like<00:00:49.210> they<00:00:49.629> were<00:00:49.659> made<00:00:49.780> for<00:00:50.440> the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
they look like they were made for the

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.889 
they look like they were made for the
PlayStation<00:00:51.190> 2<00:00:51.370> which<00:00:51.579> it<00:00:51.760> was<00:00:51.940> and<00:00:52.179> it<00:00:52.780> still

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
PlayStation 2 which it was and it still

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:54.779 
PlayStation 2 which it was and it still
looks<00:00:53.260> like<00:00:53.409> they<00:00:53.710> didn't<00:00:53.979> optimize<00:00:54.489> them<00:00:54.760> for

00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:54.789 
looks like they didn't optimize them for

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.660 
looks like they didn't optimize them for
the<00:00:55.149> retina<00:00:55.629> display<00:00:56.019> on<00:00:56.260> the<00:00:56.499> iPhone<00:00:56.949> 5s<00:00:57.249> or

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
the retina display on the iPhone 5s or

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.039 
the retina display on the iPhone 5s or
even<00:00:58.569> the<00:00:58.780> display<00:00:59.199> on<00:00:59.440> the<00:00:59.649> iPad<00:01:00.129> Mini<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:01.780> I

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:02.049 
even the display on the iPad Mini so I

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:03.629 
even the display on the iPad Mini so I
wasn't<00:01:02.379> even<00:01:02.589> show<00:01:02.769> you<00:01:02.859> that<00:01:03.010> the<00:01:03.129> iPad<00:01:03.429> Mini

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:03.639 
wasn't even show you that the iPad Mini

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:05.460 
wasn't even show you that the iPad Mini
creates<00:01:03.999> a<00:01:04.089> much<00:01:04.239> more<00:01:04.420> immersive<00:01:04.720> experience

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
creates a much more immersive experience

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.310 
creates a much more immersive experience
if<00:01:06.310> you<00:01:06.369> have<00:01:06.490> an<00:01:06.580> iPhone<00:01:07.390> if<00:01:08.020> you<00:01:08.140> have<00:01:08.229> an

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
if you have an iPhone if you have an

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.050 
if you have an iPhone if you have an
iPad<00:01:08.710> I<00:01:08.979> would<00:01:09.130> definitely<00:01:09.460> suggest<00:01:09.549> using

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
iPad I would definitely suggest using

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.370 
iPad I would definitely suggest using
this<00:01:10.330> game<00:01:10.510> for<00:01:10.840> an<00:01:10.900> iPad<00:01:11.460> because<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:14.080> can

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
this game for an iPad because you can

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.910 
this game for an iPad because you can
you<00:01:15.100> have<00:01:15.220> much<00:01:15.400> more<00:01:16.110> screen<00:01:17.110> space<00:01:17.140> but<00:01:17.770> if

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
you have much more screen space but if

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.220

much<00:01:51.820> easier<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:53.110> will<00:01:53.530> pop<00:01:53.800> up<00:01:53.830> anywhere<00:01:54.520> you

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
much easier it will pop up anywhere you

touch<00:01:54.970> on<00:01:55.180> the<00:01:55.240> screen<00:01:55.659> here<00:01:56.110> so<00:01:56.260> it<00:01:56.890> works

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
touch on the screen here so it works

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.490 
touch on the screen here so it works
very<00:01:57.580> well<00:01:57.760> on<00:01:58.210> when<00:01:58.570> you<00:01:58.690> use<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:58.990> classic

classic<00:03:41.519> I<00:03:41.609> guess<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:41.879> have<00:03:42.000> to<00:03:42.120> be<00:03:42.239> like<00:03:42.449> I

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:42.659 
classic I guess you have to be like I

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:44.509 
classic I guess you have to be like I
don't<00:03:42.930> know<00:03:43.049> I<00:03:43.560> guess<00:03:43.709> when<00:03:43.859> you<00:03:43.949> use<00:03:44.069> classic

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
don't know I guess when you use classic

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:45.860 
don't know I guess when you use classic
it's<00:03:44.669> much<00:03:44.849> harder<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.180> force<00:03:45.480> I<00:03:45.629> know<00:03:45.690> so

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
it's much harder to force I know so

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.569 
it's much harder to force I know so
let's<00:03:46.049> go<00:03:46.139> ahead<00:03:46.260> and<00:03:46.379> take<00:03:46.470> you<00:03:46.590> into<00:03:46.620> episode

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
like in the we're going ahead and skip

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:01.039 
like in the we're going ahead and skip
this<00:03:57.569> out<00:03:57.780> just<00:03:58.199> like<00:03:58.319> in<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:59.060> in<00:04:00.060> the

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
this out just like in the in the

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.330 
this out just like in the in the
PlayStation<00:04:01.590> 2<00:04:01.620> game<00:04:01.919> which<00:04:02.069> is<00:04:02.190> what<00:04:02.310> I

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
PlayStation 2 game which is what I

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.680 
PlayStation 2 game which is what I
played<00:04:02.639> it<00:04:02.729> on<00:04:02.819> I<00:04:02.879> believe<00:04:03.090> they<00:04:03.269> used<00:04:03.299> to<00:04:03.569> have

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
played it on I believe they used to have

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.550 
played it on I believe they used to have
it<00:04:03.810> for<00:04:04.019> Xbox<00:04:04.530> as<00:04:04.889> well<00:04:05.549> touch<00:04:06.419> start<00:04:06.720> we're

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
it for Xbox as well touch start we're

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.680 
it for Xbox as well touch start we're
going<00:04:07.709> to<00:04:07.769> start<00:04:08.129> up<00:04:08.250> or<00:04:08.729> in<00:04:08.940> the<00:04:09.030> game<00:04:09.209> on<00:04:09.449> the

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
going to start up or in the game on the

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.119 
going to start up or in the game on the
graphics<00:04:10.079> aren't<00:04:10.319> the<00:04:10.409> best<00:04:10.560> again<00:04:10.859> they're

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
graphics aren't the best again they're

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:13.849 
graphics aren't the best again they're
still<00:04:11.400> scaled<00:04:12.180> down<00:04:12.419> even<00:04:13.319> the<00:04:13.409> aspect<00:04:13.799> ratio

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
still scaled down even the aspect ratio

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.490 
still scaled down even the aspect ratio
is<00:04:14.280> off<00:04:14.459> the<00:04:15.269> aspect<00:04:15.599> ratio<00:04:15.659> looks<00:04:16.169> like<00:04:16.349> it's

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
is off the aspect ratio looks like it's

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.080 
is off the aspect ratio looks like it's
sixteen<00:04:16.829> by<00:04:17.010> nine<00:04:17.039> instead<00:04:17.639> of<00:04:17.760> four<00:04:17.940> by<00:04:18.060> three

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
sixteen by nine instead of four by three

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.640 
sixteen by nine instead of four by three
which<00:04:18.570> is<00:04:18.599> what<00:04:18.840> it<00:04:18.930> should<00:04:19.019> be<00:04:19.079> for<00:04:19.169> the<00:04:19.320> iPad

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
which is what it should be for the iPad

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.719 
which is what it should be for the iPad
but<00:04:19.889> that's<00:04:20.370> alright

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
but that's alright

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.870 
but that's alright
it<00:04:23.729> pretty<00:04:23.970> much<00:04:24.090> is<00:04:24.270> a<00:04:24.300> direct<00:04:24.659> copy<00:04:24.870> from<00:04:25.409> the

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
it pretty much is a direct copy from the

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.219 
it pretty much is a direct copy from the
PlayStation<00:04:26.880> 2<00:04:27.210> version<00:04:27.360> but<00:04:27.810> that's<00:04:27.930> alright

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
PlayStation 2 version but that's alright

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.540 
PlayStation 2 version but that's alright
it's<00:04:28.710> not<00:04:28.830> terrible<00:04:29.750> the<00:04:30.830> now<00:04:31.830> I<00:04:31.860> will<00:04:32.130> say<00:04:32.370> the

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
it's not terrible the now I will say the

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.750 
it's not terrible the now I will say the
eye

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
eye

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.640 
eye
had<00:04:32.910> many<00:04:33.150> I<00:04:33.360> did<00:04:33.660> experience<00:04:34.020> some<00:04:34.320> lag

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
had many I did experience some lag

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.620 
had many I did experience some lag
earlier<00:04:35.130> and<00:04:35.370> I<00:04:36.000> don't<00:04:36.060> know<00:04:36.210> what<00:04:36.360> that<00:04:36.480> was

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
earlier and I don't know what that was

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.560 
earlier and I don't know what that was
from<00:04:36.810> but<00:04:37.370> I<00:04:38.370> was<00:04:38.610> experiencing<00:04:39.180> lag<00:04:39.360> on<00:04:39.510> the

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
from but I was experiencing lag on the

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.140 
from but I was experiencing lag on the
iPad<00:04:39.840> Mini<00:04:39.990> as<00:04:40.170> with<00:04:40.440> the<00:04:40.590> iPhone<00:04:41.310> 5s<00:04:41.760> and<00:04:41.790> it's

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
iPad Mini as with the iPhone 5s and it's

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.450 
iPad Mini as with the iPhone 5s and it's
much<00:04:42.510> much<00:04:42.750> faster<00:04:43.200> processor<00:04:43.740> I<00:04:43.770> experienced

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
much much faster processor I experienced

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.390 
much much faster processor I experienced
absolutely<00:04:45.150> no<00:04:45.330> lag<00:04:45.600> ever<00:04:46.040> so<00:04:47.040> if<00:04:47.130> you<00:04:47.220> have

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
absolutely no lag ever so if you have

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.830 
absolutely no lag ever so if you have
one<00:04:47.550> of<00:04:47.640> the<00:04:47.700> newer<00:04:47.910> devices<00:04:48.270> you<00:04:48.570> should<00:04:48.750> be

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
one of the newer devices you should be

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.170 
one of the newer devices you should be
absolutely<00:04:49.350> fine<00:04:49.440> but<00:04:50.280> since<00:04:50.580> I'm<00:04:50.850> running<00:04:51.120> on

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
absolutely fine but since I'm running on

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.780 
absolutely fine but since I'm running on
the<00:04:51.300> a5<00:04:51.720> processor<00:04:51.930> here<00:04:52.500> you<00:04:53.370> should<00:04:53.640> be<00:04:53.730> able

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
the a5 processor here you should be able

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.340 
the a5 processor here you should be able
to<00:04:53.910> notice<00:04:54.180> a<00:04:54.210> little<00:04:54.300> bit<00:04:54.420> of<00:04:54.570> lag<00:04:54.720> spikes<00:04:55.110> and

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
to notice a little bit of lag spikes and

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.900 
to notice a little bit of lag spikes and
the<00:04:55.860> frames<00:04:56.130> will<00:04:56.340> drop<00:04:56.660> occasionally<00:04:57.660> I

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
the frames will drop occasionally I

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.850 
the frames will drop occasionally I
still<00:04:59.910> don't<00:05:00.030> know<00:05:00.060> how<00:05:00.210> to<00:05:00.240> force<00:05:00.710> objects<00:05:01.710> so

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
still don't know how to force objects so

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.950 
still don't know how to force objects so
but<00:05:02.400> frames<00:05:02.670> will<00:05:02.880> drop<00:05:03.120> occasionally<00:05:03.630> oh<00:05:03.780> my

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
but frames will drop occasionally oh my

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.920 
but frames will drop occasionally oh my
god<00:05:04.110> and<00:05:04.200> run<00:05:04.350> outside<00:05:04.500> here<00:05:05.490> so<00:05:05.820> we<00:05:05.940> can<00:05:06.090> so

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
god and run outside here so we can so

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.720 
god and run outside here so we can so
you<00:05:06.990> can<00:05:07.140> see<00:05:07.290> what<00:05:07.410> it's<00:05:07.530> like<00:05:07.650> a<00:05:07.680> fight<00:05:08.130> it's

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:08.730 
you can see what it's like a fight it's

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.160 
you can see what it's like a fight it's
kind<00:05:08.910> of<00:05:08.940> hard<00:05:09.090> to<00:05:09.120> do<00:05:09.270> the<00:05:09.390> search<00:05:09.600> screen<00:05:09.840> but

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
kind of hard to do the search screen but

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.040 
kind of hard to do the search screen but
okay<00:05:10.740> I<00:05:10.770> don't<00:05:11.240> maybe<00:05:12.240> we<00:05:12.360> won't<00:05:12.480> run<00:05:12.660> outside

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
okay I don't maybe we won't run outside

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.670 
okay I don't maybe we won't run outside
I<00:05:13.460> don't<00:05:14.460> know<00:05:14.550> how<00:05:14.640> to<00:05:14.730> force<00:05:15.470> let's<00:05:16.470> see<00:05:16.590> what

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
I don't know how to force let's see what

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.220 
I don't know how to force let's see what
this<00:05:16.770> guy<00:05:16.920> says<00:05:17.180> hold<00:05:18.180> question<00:05:18.690> mark<00:05:18.900> okay<00:05:19.170> so

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
this guy says hold question mark okay so
