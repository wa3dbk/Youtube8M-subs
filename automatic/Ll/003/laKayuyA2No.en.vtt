00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:15.929
 finish 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.929
 the counselor 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.210
 the world the strategy of the creation zone 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.970
 a title to be presented to us they said press interferes 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.380
 this time we will immerse ourselves in a post-apocalyptic world 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.010
 humans are conditions to a lack area of ​​these 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.640
 it was meant to control the weather 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.650
 in this world has suffered 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.210
 So much of the supremacy of the planet was taken by the humans who had 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.210
 submerged 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.120
 a new human race and of comforts and girls that he tries to exterminate for all 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.670
 media 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.670
 to the few remaining humans 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.320
 yes many defining arts make history these radars presented 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.479
 commented a bit predictable is that players will not be lost anymore 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.580
 demanding 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.560
 in terms of gameplay this offers us an original proposal but that 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.550
 it does not stop curdling 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.260
 the first thing that comes to mind is the really innovative mechanics but 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.640
 does not convince at the level of control 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.210
 the camera also cited the near-battlefield and complicates a lot 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.870
 our ability to move around in an environment as well as to defend more than 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.210
 Possible attacks at several different points on the map at the same time 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.410
 the units we cover 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.400
 possibilities very well adapted to the use of command but it is complicated to do 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.950
 that are shifted to the desired point by the limitations of the camera 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.370
 this is clearly aggravated in the versions of that 4 60 and playstation 3 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.340
 in which there is in you all the patent to see us forced to use he explains 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.660
 logical 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.750
 co 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.560
 As for the levels, the first thing that strikes us is that possibility 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.279
 to handle bipedal robots in the mecca style 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:12.689
 which are quite striking 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:15.689
 in general the title has a good staff with great amenities 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:18.719
 public and in addition to this the advance of the fire is adequate 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:22.719
 we will dispose appropriately for each enemy type you situation 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:26.799
 now 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.959
 this work is offers us several game modes 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.500
 first of all this beautiful story in which the central will make the plot 

00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:34.889
 principal 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:38.269
 in second place it is in skirmish mode in which we can carry out 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.579
 fast combat against cpv 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:43.930
 finally this multiplayer demo that will allow us to play that game 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.249
 insured up to other items of cooperative type without a doubt the best of title 

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:52.989
 but the real problem is that it is not easy to find games 

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:58.549
 in regard to technical section the title shows an aspect is stable 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.719
 but with some deficiency 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:03.849
 some of these people in oklahoma city moderated some of the 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.560
 rather precarious characters 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.290
 however it produces a good impression in general terms therefore its 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.379
 attitude protected 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.299
 in real time 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.919
 in terms of sound and following the general line of play is not remarkable 

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:20.829
 the effects are adequate but it catches our attention and the soundtrack is about 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.179
 be effective but not get it 

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:28.379
 In short, we are facing a dam and with an original approach, clearly the 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.969
 poor for an unviable control indicated only for fans 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:34.969
 staunch gender who want to explore points of view 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:47.499
