00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.759

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.450
 bu controller 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:13.990
 Here's Look public service button is fit but flickering 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:19.270
 It was sticking out , so this day 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:23.950
 When you look at the updated information to launch a power thought I'd do such 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:30.280
 It's a pass card suica like transportation 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:36.570
 It was announced that we would be able to make payments with cards tomorrow as well . 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:42.180
 This is if you can shop transportation electronic money year- old more easily than ever 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.750
 This I also it was a mystery but I had to update the data of the wii u of a child 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.129
 mark 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:51.390
 Use something when you control fishing in the game controller 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:56.560
 I thought I would be a mark for something but actually I am here 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:01:01.600
 If you hold transportation electronic money, you can settle here 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.410
 Rather than the mobile suica I to have the c-roads of this little Rilakkuma 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.909
 Stretched 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:10.460
 It's an extra card, but it's rather old, but now it's a watermelon card 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:16.230
 Request to a child's front side 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:19.320
 Because I'd have stretched the seal is not a little this your Kanegae much entered 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:23.870
 Let's go to the charge from now 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.870

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.590

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.149
 Articles that were languages 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.149
 Oh 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.790

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.820

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.230
 With no Deployment 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.820
 I will not come 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:02.970
 I was charged 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:11.209
 It really I'll try a little whether it is this settlement 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:11.209
 The easiest settlement certification of here as an example of direction can be seen in and a shop 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:30.910

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:36.570

 And there are 4 ways here so you can add this 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:03:01.960
 It is in the form of charging this opportunity itself and purchasing the app, etc. 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:04.819
 When you buy the app, you can shop directly with a voice without holding it directly in the afternoon 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:08.030
 I think but I have nothing to buy 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:09.250
 I will only charge 500 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.190

 Now Balance Â¥ 2,308 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:39.060

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:48.110
 Early ne yes 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:50.250
 Karaoke if we simply like this usually use the most in suica that has been chan in the opposite 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:56.160
 The right to use 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:57.240

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.630

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:04.020

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:10.370
 Was introduced in the body of wii u 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:12.760
 It was a notice that the amount could be charged using a transportation electronic money card 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.760
