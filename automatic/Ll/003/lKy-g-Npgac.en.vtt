00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.490 

weekend<00:05:10.700> weekend<00:05:11.510> after<00:05:11.780> weekend<00:05:12.200> after

weekend weekend after weekend after
weekend<00:05:12.980> I<00:05:15.580> guess<00:05:16.580> it<00:05:16.730> can<00:05:16.850> be<00:05:16.880> somewhat

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
weekend I guess it can be somewhat

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.480 
weekend I guess it can be somewhat
unappreciated<00:05:18.650> because<00:05:18.800> it's<00:05:18.950> not<00:05:19.160> shown

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
unappreciated because it's not shown

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.280 
unappreciated because it's not shown
