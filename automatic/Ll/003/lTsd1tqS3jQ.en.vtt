00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.359
 plus 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.820
 ah 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:10.570
 Hello 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.969
 bye 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:17.140
 today we are going to make jam from madroño 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:19.650
 the ingredients are lemon sugar and 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.650
 arbutus 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.939
 what we are doing with a lot 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:30.519
 Patience is waiting for the madroño and 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.410
 being left alone with the pulp so that 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:35.250
 time to make the jam what 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.920
 let's find the granules of the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.199
 of the fruit 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.530
 in a saucepan we have thrown all the 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:45.750
 pulp although there are remains of the medita 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.050
 chromas does not matter because then we go 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.120
 to calculate now at very slow fire what 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.390
 we have put and we are going to take the juice 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.390
 of a lemon 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.250
 and a half sugar cup 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.960
 and we are going to remove it from time to time 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.880
 when we are about to have it 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.880
 about 40 minutes on very low heat 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.000
 after about a half 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.850
 horita a fuego muy lento this is the 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.220
 result as we still have some 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.720
 granules and is usually uncomfortable at the time 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.760
 to take it 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.050
 so let's proceed and let's try 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.050
 strain most 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.850
 ah 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:48.520
 let's try to strain most 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.520
 and be able to eliminate a great myth 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.840
 good as check we have already passed 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.670
 everything in the colander will be seen 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.920
 some little friends but they are not so 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.130
 uncomfortable palate you see that the appearance 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.620
 it is espesito we are going to give a blow of 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.960
 heat of about 34 minutes 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.149
 and we are going to have prepared some 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.360
 pots glass or glass jars 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.250
 well cleaned that is dry because 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.730
 this has to get hot in the 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.730
 glass jar 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.300
 Well, this is now ready in 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.510
 a pot that is clean and dry 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.900
 We're going to throw it out with a lot of glass 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.900
 cautious 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:49.360
 we're going to put the cover on 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:52.210
 immediately we will tighten it well and 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.580
 we are going to put it upside down we are going to 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.530
 keep upside down 12 hours this is 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.000
 necessary for the effect to be 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.070
 empty 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.230
 well, strawberry jam and 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.480
 is ready we have accompanied a 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.070
 heart you can accompany
