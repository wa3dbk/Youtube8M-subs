00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
we're joined this eyeliner is because it

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.540 
we're joined this eyeliner is because it
really<00:00:46.930> helps<00:00:47.230> disguise<00:00:47.680> the<00:00:48.309> false

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
really helps disguise the false

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:56.220 
really helps disguise the false
eyelashes<00:00:49.210> once<00:00:49.480> they're<00:00:49.750> on<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:55.750> just<00:00:56.019> as

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
eyelashes once they're on so just as

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:29.899 
eyelashes once they're on so just as
close<00:00:56.559> as<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:58.390> can<00:00:58.629> to<00:00:58.690> the<00:00:59.290> lash<00:00:59.470> line

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.880 

so<00:01:30.909> here<00:01:31.149> are<00:01:31.390> the<00:01:31.420> four<00:01:31.810> flushes<00:01:32.320> and<00:01:32.560> to

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
so here are the four flushes and to

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.819 
so here are the four flushes and to
remove<00:01:33.219> them<00:01:33.520> simply<00:01:34.060> use<00:01:34.990> your<00:01:35.200> finger<00:01:35.619> to

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
remove them simply use your finger to

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:41.279 
remove them simply use your finger to
gently<00:01:36.579> roll<00:01:37.030> and<00:01:37.390> pull<00:01:37.689> them<00:01:37.929> out<00:01:38.079> you<00:01:40.289> should

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289 
gently roll and pull them out you should

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.840 
gently roll and pull them out you should
see<00:01:41.530> that<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:43.210> come<00:01:43.390> off<00:01:43.509> fairly<00:01:43.810> easily<00:01:44.850> so

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
see that to come off fairly easily so

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.410 
see that to come off fairly easily so
again<00:01:46.209> using<00:01:46.420> your<00:01:46.689> finger<00:01:47.219> roll<00:01:48.219> and<00:01:48.850> pull

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
again using your finger roll and pull

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:56.550 
again using your finger roll and pull
them<00:01:49.659> out<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:54.909> the<00:01:55.090> next<00:01:55.270> step<00:01:55.539> is<00:01:55.810> to<00:01:56.049> fit<00:01:56.259> the

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
them out so the next step is to fit the

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.580 
them out so the next step is to fit the
eyelashes<00:01:57.219> to<00:01:57.700> your<00:01:58.000> eyes<00:01:58.229> making<00:01:59.229> sure<00:01:59.409> that

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
eyelashes to your eyes making sure that

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.219 
eyelashes to your eyes making sure that
it's<00:01:59.799> the<00:01:59.860> right<00:02:00.069> length<00:02:00.399> so<00:02:00.989> I'm<00:02:01.989> just<00:02:02.110> gonna

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
it's the right length so I'm just gonna

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:10.380 
it's the right length so I'm just gonna
put<00:02:02.500> that<00:02:02.649> on<00:02:02.860> top<00:02:03.130> of<00:02:03.310> my<00:02:03.459> eyes<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.849> as<00:02:10.269> you

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
put that on top of my eyes and as you

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.170 
put that on top of my eyes and as you
can<00:02:10.539> see<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:11.110> length<00:02:11.290> is<00:02:11.530> pretty<00:02:11.769> fine<00:02:12.310> so<00:02:12.700> I'm

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
can see the length is pretty fine so I'm

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.780 
can see the length is pretty fine so I'm
not<00:02:13.329> going<00:02:13.569> to<00:02:13.690> cut<00:02:14.680> these<00:02:14.860> but<00:02:15.190> if<00:02:15.340> these<00:02:15.549> are

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
not going to cut these but if these are

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.490 
not going to cut these but if these are
big<00:02:15.970> enough<00:02:16.150> for<00:02:16.209> you<00:02:16.480> then<00:02:16.660> feel<00:02:16.840> free<00:02:16.900> to<00:02:17.170> go

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
big enough for you then feel free to go

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.610 
big enough for you then feel free to go
ahead<00:02:17.799> and<00:02:18.010> snip<00:02:18.849> off<00:02:19.090> a<00:02:19.329> bit<00:02:19.810> from<00:02:20.079> the<00:02:20.290> front

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
ahead and snip off a bit from the front

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.300 
ahead and snip off a bit from the front
or<00:02:20.769> from<00:02:20.829> the<00:02:21.489> end<00:02:22.410> now<00:02:23.410> taking<00:02:23.829> the<00:02:23.950> eyelash

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
or from the end now taking the eyelash

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.130 
or from the end now taking the eyelash
you<00:02:24.519> want<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:24.849> just<00:02:25.060> give<00:02:25.239> it<00:02:25.269> a<00:02:25.450> no<00:02:25.720> wiggle

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
you want to just give it a no wiggle

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.949 
you want to just give it a no wiggle
this<00:02:26.829> will<00:02:27.099> really<00:02:27.519> loosen<00:02:27.940> up<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.390> band<00:02:28.629> on

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
this will really loosen up the band on

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.390 
this will really loosen up the band on
the<00:02:29.290> lash<00:02:31.319> making<00:02:32.319> sure<00:02:32.530> it's<00:02:32.769> more<00:02:33.010> easy<00:02:33.220> to

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
the lash making sure it's more easy to

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.770 
the lash making sure it's more easy to
apply<00:02:33.970> when<00:02:34.750> you<00:02:34.900> do<00:02:35.079> apply<00:02:35.380> them<00:02:36.600> so<00:02:37.600> next

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
apply when you do apply them so next

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.809 
apply when you do apply them so next
comes<00:02:38.049> the<00:02:38.260> glue<00:02:38.560> part<00:02:38.829> and<00:02:39.190> what<00:02:39.549> I'm<00:02:39.639> going

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
comes the glue part and what I'm going

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.289 
comes the glue part and what I'm going
to<00:02:39.850> do<00:02:40.030> is<00:02:40.560> just<00:02:41.560> gently<00:02:41.739> brush<00:02:42.340> on<00:02:42.639> a<00:02:43.000> fairly

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
to do is just gently brush on a fairly

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:50.430 
to do is just gently brush on a fairly
small<00:02:46.299> amount<00:02:47.519> just<00:02:48.519> enough<00:02:48.989> to<00:02:49.989> cover<00:02:50.200> the

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
small amount just enough to cover the

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.670 
small amount just enough to cover the
band<00:02:50.849> you<00:02:51.849> don't<00:02:52.030> want<00:02:52.180> to<00:02:52.359> overload<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:53.440> band

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
band you don't want to overload the band

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.770 
band you don't want to overload the band
because<00:02:54.130> that<00:02:54.310> can<00:02:54.489> make<00:02:54.700> it<00:02:54.880> a<00:02:55.060> bit<00:02:55.389> tricky

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
because that can make it a bit tricky

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.740 
because that can make it a bit tricky
and<00:02:55.900> whilst<00:02:56.079> you<00:02:56.349> applying<00:02:56.739> it

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.160 

so<00:03:02.750> once<00:03:02.960> we've<00:03:03.110> got<00:03:03.290> a<00:03:03.700> white<00:03:04.700> line<00:03:05.180> or<00:03:05.660> white

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
so once we've got a white line or white

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.430 
so once we've got a white line or white
glue<00:03:06.590> along<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:08.420> off<00:03:08.660> the<00:03:08.810> eyelash<00:03:09.140> I'm

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
glue along the and off the eyelash I'm

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.080 
glue along the and off the eyelash I'm
just<00:03:09.590> going<00:03:09.710> to<00:03:09.740> give<00:03:09.890> it<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:10.070> blow<00:03:10.340> for<00:03:10.880> about

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
just going to give it a blow for about

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.520 
just going to give it a blow for about
10<00:03:11.300> seconds<00:03:11.750> to<00:03:11.870> make<00:03:12.110> sure<00:03:12.290> it's<00:03:12.440> tacky<00:03:14.530> and

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
10 seconds to make sure it's tacky and

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.130 
10 seconds to make sure it's tacky and
once<00:03:15.800> the<00:03:16.040> glue<00:03:16.250> is<00:03:16.430> turning<00:03:17.120> slightly<00:03:17.690> clear

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
once the glue is turning slightly clear

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.980 
once the glue is turning slightly clear
I'm<00:03:18.410> going<00:03:18.920> to<00:03:19.040> use<00:03:19.220> some<00:03:19.460> tweezers<00:03:19.810> place<00:03:20.810> it
