00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.420
 good what you are seeing is a 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:46.220
 fragment of a video of a rash 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:48.230
 volcano Popocatepetl this year I 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.120
 my cosmic friend has passed it and then 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:55.280
 he was seen to appear above the 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:57.230
 fumarole in a luminous ball that comes out 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.269
 from a cloud if it disappears 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.280
 automatically before entering the 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:04.070
 curtain of smoke not at first I 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.409
 I thought it could be a reflection but 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.360
 then by passing it in slow motion 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.700
 practically frame by frame it 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.729
 he appreciates how he is really breaking the 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.130
 cloud and it descends quickly and 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.230
 disappears before touching the curtain of 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:23.040
 smoke then I what have I done 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:25.250
 is to look for other videos on the network about 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.260
 this rash 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.720
 and I found one where they look 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:33.870
 leave fired several pieces of rock 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.840
 and another video in which it appears on the 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:40.540
 same volcano and also right in the 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.100
 fireplace vertical as 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.420
 another ball not in this case the color 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.300
 dark 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.210
 here we see it 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.820
 but that you have appreciated well you see how 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.150
 is breaking the cloud or seemingly 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.520
 he breaks it until it disappears before 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.650
 enter the fumarole what I do not know if it is 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.920
 a vertical fall or because it is 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.210
 moving away on the horizon very quickly 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.300
 well I repeat then what we're going to see 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.920
 then it is another fragment 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.010
 another video in which you will see rocks 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.030
 farewells as they are totally different 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.390
 to what is seen in this video 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:23.430
 and another fragment of another video in which 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:25.530
 let's see then that a supposed use that 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.900
 there is totally stationary on the 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.420
 chimney of this volcano 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:36.370
 I can not get more conclusive data 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.370
 so you already decide 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.090
 no way 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.780
 to win 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.450
 the exhalations of low intensity 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.760
 accompanied by steam and gas as well 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.890
 as small amounts of ash this 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.330
 it does not represent a risk for the population 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.150
 so the warning light 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.920
 volcanic remains in yellow phase 2 without 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.880
 However , the probability of 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.980
 emission of incandescent fragments of 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.620
 low intensity accompanied by steam from 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.290
 water and gas as well as small graces from 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.850
 ash this does not represent risk to the 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.590
 population so the traffic light of 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.010
 volcanic alert continues in yellow phase 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.010
 two
