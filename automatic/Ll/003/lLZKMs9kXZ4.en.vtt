00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:12.389
 since I heard the music protect lÃ©o 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.570
 straddle I ask myself exactly what 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.460
 means being a toast to what he wants 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.859
 say with a has to be shielded not 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.270
 do they shield themselves means having a 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.330
 armored body 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.000
 What are you doing today? Let's do it. 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.029
 that being blind means having a game 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.369
 armored person is a man who does not 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.110
 affects with external things party 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.550
 achieve the dreamed stability 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.620
 emotional 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.230
 you first stop talking about a list of 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.329
 things that may perhaps shake or 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.820
 mess with your inner game 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.050
 these things can be critical 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.750
 destructive curses offenses 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.750
 provocations envy when something 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.030
 What did you do wrong when you are rejected? 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.309
 by a woman and especially a 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.230
 unrequited passion 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.140
 so that this can really 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.450
 make an unshakable man is necessary 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.430
 understand these three things to know 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.460
 distinguish these things and try to have a 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.380
 minimum control over each of them 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.820
 are they reliable self-esteem and ego 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.189
 trust I'll try to summarize in a 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.009
 phrase the true meaning of 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.890
 Trust confidence is when 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.979
 feel they have the ability to exercise 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.560
 given task that is not enough 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.229
 decide that from now on everything will 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.650
 be confident your trust needs 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.229
 have a basis in the case my trust is 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.210
 based on my life experience the 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.850
 my trust with women was 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.520
 based on my previous achievements 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.159
 moral of the story the trust is being 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.960
 built over time 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.240
 It's but and who's new is starting. 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.540
 now and has no experience will take away 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.880
 trust where so I'll teach 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.990
 a small but city that I have always used and 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.299
 still use 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.969
 assuming you are doing a certain 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.479
 trust that is what 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:12.030
 to meet women a test a 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.490
 job interview so easy 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.050
 Let's say you tried 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.150
 that there are ten women in one 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.290
 certain period of your life 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.690
 of these 9 9 rejected sharply 9 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.470
 that humiliated laughed at your face 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.830
 but one of them got you those nine that 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.540
 will reject you will delete from your memory 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.630
 You will not think about it and you will 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.390
 bothering me if I should think of something 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.210
 will think only of the one who took 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.840
 this goes for everything always focuses on 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:47.540
 positive the negative result 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.210
 excludes self-esteem much has been said 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.210
 about self-esteem and self-esteem for 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.640
 self esteem, but you know what? 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.670
 really that means do not know the 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.520
 importance it has for you 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:04.160
 self-esteem is accepting oneself and liking 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.220
 of himself and enjoy living in the 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.260
 own life is how confidence does not 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.540
 self-esteem from one hour to the next if 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.210
 builds over time 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.860
 and for this you need to find yourself stopping 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.940
 live the lives of others and live the 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.280
 own life 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.920
 stop living from the past and 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.710
 live the present moment to know what you 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.820
 likes and seeks to do these activities 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.070
 look for good companies 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.260
 and then when your life 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.850
 have had a harmony between 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.030
 all aspects 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.880
 self esteem will appear and last item 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:41.150
 and more important is the ego 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.430
 first what is gugu i would say 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.400
 and gugu is a house of cards or a 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.680
 balloon imagines that a person's ego is 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.420
 a balloon and as that person goes 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.850
 receiving compliments 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.370
 the balloon will inflate and the more 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.010
 filled for that easier helix balloon 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.590
 bubble burst in other words how much 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.170
 the more fragile you are, the more fragile you are. 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.660
 vulnerability is to bad things like 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.550
 from the list I mentioned earlier in the 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.670
 strong point here is not to have an ego 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:13.660
 armored and yes do not have ego 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.700
 It was a thing in the head, same ego. 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:19.010
 fragility and vulnerability 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.910
 This is a very bulky and difficult subject. 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.840
 to understand 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.040
 so I'll use another analogy 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.980
 Imagine that a 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.010
 target and your ego, or 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.890
 the balloon is the target and the criticism and offense 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.600
 are the data that people play for 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.330
 try to hit the balloon 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.640
 The smaller and further you have your 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.730
 The hardest target will be the people 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:45.490
 hit the dice will go over 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.770
 on the side but they will not get it right 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.620
 it is as if it had transcended the 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.360
 things before I work as a coach 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.820
 I worked for an extremely expensive guy. 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.160
 complaining and cursing me for 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.830
 anything and it irritated me 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:03.130
 All day he was in a bad mood and it was 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:05.650
 so all day one day after another 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.280
 because it affected me directly in the 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.380
 ego 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.320
 came a point where what he was talking about 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.540
 enter into the ear and out into the other self 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.720
 I learned to transcend the shit he 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:19.180
 I was talking and it did not affect me any more and I 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.030
 I got it because you understand what the 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.530
 ego understands what attitudes we take 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.410
 because of the ego 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.490
 and thought twice before suffering for 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.590
 something 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.710
 It made me sick because I really 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:36.010
 did it wrong or because it only affected my ego 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:39.070
 and gradually the ego was fading and I went 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:42.250
 making me not be shielded but a being 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:44.860
 transparent and transcendent someone 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:47.260
 it is impossible to be affected by a criticism 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.990
 destructive action for an offense or 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.600
 that rejection is only part of the 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:55.000
 true emotional stability that 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.670
 women both look for a man 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.650
