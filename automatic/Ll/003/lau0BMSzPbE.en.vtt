00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.750
 there is a strange version of what 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.120
 industrialization started earlier 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.339
 static says about it twenty 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.769
 the eighth year already purchases imported 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:18.840
 equipment went to the full I enjoyed 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:22.230
 even before the military statistics 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.380
 reference books and we are told that there 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.050
 mean there is still in party 6 discussion on 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.039
 about the first five year plan that 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.950
 means purchases 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.630
 understand the trade balance he fixes 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:40.800
 the intersection of state goods 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.750
 Borders I studied at the Institute on 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.610
 faculty past international commission 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.570
 relations specialty economist by 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.450
 foreign trade 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.840
 what is international trade 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.510
 equipment machines for what's up 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.870
 the moment of machinery and equipment 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.890
 cross the customs border before that 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.680
 must pass at least a year and a half 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:07.190
 maybe two years because first 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.310
 need to develop 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.710
 feasibility study 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.560
 the project 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.380
 which will fit in which 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.760
 the project will be written from the equipment 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.280
 just so no one buys bordeaux not 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.110
 equipped must be complete 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.530
 you buy for here then he is nothing 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.230
 need to 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.000
 you buy for now if you mean 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.909
 this is some element 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.240
 assets and what part of the active elements 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.270
 fixed assets means you and where we 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.060
 there were projects we did not mention 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.100
 I can not understand these projects 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.830
 came albert caen the twenty ninth 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.590
 year began to design factories a 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.890
 purchase of equipment twenty eighth 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.970
 year 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:55.229
 start negotiating some orders there 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.940
 understand there are two types of equipment 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:04.500
 if the equipment they say he sat he 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:07.409
 shock show that is on the store shelf and 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.200
 the simplest equipment any there 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.170
 the simplest drilling machine 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.390
 You can buy it immediately in stock 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.970
 complex equipment like blue Ming 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.890
 sliding you only order it nobody 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.849
 advance does not produce there 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.300
 the production cycle 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:26.310
 in short, trust me I have my 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.340
 project financing book where I 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.050
 I am writing about the contract and about the supplies from 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.870
 of the moment 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:36.360
 of negotiations before crossing she is so so 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.690
 the goods of the border should pass approximately 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.730
 two years I can get it turns out 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.560
 that somewhere some fundamental 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.950
 decisions were taken for the twenty- fifth 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.530
 year but in the textbooks the project is nothing 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.310
 written on the twenty-fifth year of December 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.890
 passed the 14th party congress on the fourteenth 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.870
 the party congress Stalin said for the first time 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:03.680
 said we need industrialization 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:07.970
 Incidentally, the impact of the fact that 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:11.250
 Americans accepted this dawes plan 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.890
 I have already mentioned several times a dawes plan 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.650
 to heights is actually a plan which 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:22.410
 facilitated reparation time for 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:24.390
 germany and actually well rendered assistance 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.760
 Germany in terms of restoring it 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.650
 economy ie recovery 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.280
 economy has begun will not come liri 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.739
 much earlier the plan was given but naturally 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.510
 Davos plan was provided that 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.560
 money then germany should still 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.780
 return west drug due to what 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.410
 there it was right said plan yes let 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.579
 guys we help you create your 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.430
 industry 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:52.140
 and here in this industry production 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.299
 industry sell east 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.630
 sell to the Soviet Union 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:59.870
 they are huge appendage and europe and here 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.700
 steel at the fourteenth congress said 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:06.090
 the dawes plan treats us like 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.220
 appendage of the western economy we cannot 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.989
 allow it we must create our 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:16.709
 the industry of this was for the first time a slogan 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:18.720
 industrialization but i don't understand how 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.729
 way such scales and wrestlers 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.090
 could pass the twenty eighth year 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:25.670
 This means that negotiations and contracts 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.790
 should have signed up 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.860
 this is the twenty sixth year and twenty 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:34.190
 in the sixth year yes of course it was already inflicted 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:37.070
 mortal blow to Zinoviev sky 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.320
 Trotsky opposition already in my twenty 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.320
 sixth year you salt there in almaty 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.960
 even the country did not send him here that is 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.390
 it turns out that Stalin parallel solved 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.120
 questions and politically and specific 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:54.050
 specific economic sector and 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:56.360
 say that of course there were such 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:00.920
 energetic passionary people surrounded 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:06.050
 Stalin and Jeniki for Kuibyshev Dzerzhinsk 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:09.470
 by the way for women but here at the same 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.630
 Dmitriy Verkhoturov himself fat 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:15.400
 book on industrialization but not a word 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:18.290
 it is not said that some of ours 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:21.530
 organizations negotiated with Western 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.370
 companies for orders and shipments 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:26.630
 equipment 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:28.760
 the Soviet Union it was here those are starting 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.490
 the story of albert cana albert can 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:34.220
 got a contract for two billion he 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:38.750
 built projected and built 530 a 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:42.470
 this one from 26 to 29 Here it is 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:47.080
 then dark dark i call historians 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.080
 historians start digging
