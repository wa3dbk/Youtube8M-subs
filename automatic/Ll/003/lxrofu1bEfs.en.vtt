about what I've got first I've got a

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.620 
about what I've got first I've got a
basic<00:00:24.840> plain<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:26.250> has<00:00:26.400> collision<00:00:26.939> on<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.210> okay

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
basic plain it has collision on it okay

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.749 
basic plain it has collision on it okay
I've<00:00:27.810> got<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.019> model<00:00:28.830> just<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.310> 3d<00:00:29.699> mesh<00:00:30.830> I've<00:00:31.830> got

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
I've got a model just a 3d mesh I've got

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.639 
I've got a model just a 3d mesh I've got
a<00:00:32.790> camera<00:00:33.390> that's<00:00:33.600> been<00:00:33.809> parented<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.380> that

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
a camera that's been parented to that

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.380 
a camera that's been parented to that
model<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.309> as<00:00:35.550> we<00:00:35.880> sort<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.840> move<00:00:37.050> okay<00:00:38.390> the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
model so as we sort of move okay the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.970 
model so as we sort of move okay the
camera<00:00:39.750> will<00:00:39.899> stick<00:00:40.200> with<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.559> model<00:00:40.890> and

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
camera will stick with the model and

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.170 
camera will stick with the model and
we're<00:00:41.160> going<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.309> use<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.670> later<00:00:41.850> just<00:00:42.120> to

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
we're going to use that later just to

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.700 
we're going to use that later just to
sort<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.480> demonstrate<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.290> animation

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
sort of demonstrate that the animation

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.520 
sort of demonstrate that the animation
works<00:00:43.940> right<00:00:44.940> now<00:00:45.090> I've<00:00:45.270> got<00:00:45.300> some<00:00:45.809> basic<00:00:46.260> you

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
works right now I've got some basic you

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.410 
works right now I've got some basic you
know<00:00:46.649> logic<00:00:47.280> bricks<00:00:47.489> set<00:00:47.730> up<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.210> can

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
know logic bricks set up so that I can

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.990 
know logic bricks set up so that I can
move<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.079> character<00:00:49.350> back<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.039> forth<00:00:50.280> by

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
move the character back and forth by

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.200 
move the character back and forth by
pressing<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.780> keyboard<00:00:52.350> keys<00:00:52.649> now<00:00:53.520> if<00:00:53.820> you're

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
pressing to keyboard keys now if you're

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.939 
pressing to keyboard keys now if you're
unsure<00:00:54.390> how<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.750> do<00:00:55.020> any<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.800> can

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
unsure how to do any of that you can

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
so what I've got here is I have a

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.920 
so what I've got here is I have a
armature<00:01:09.770> that<00:01:10.770> has<00:01:10.890> been<00:01:11.100> added<00:01:11.720> all<00:01:12.720> right

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
armature that has been added all right

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.830 
armature that has been added all right
inside<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.979> mesh<00:01:14.330> and<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.600> very

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
inside of a mesh and this is a very

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.140 
inside of a mesh and this is a very
simple<00:01:16.110> armature<00:01:16.710> alright<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.119> first

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
simple armature alright so the first

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.550 
simple armature alright so the first
thing<00:01:18.420> I'm<00:01:18.600> going<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.780> do<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.140> I'm<00:01:19.409> going<00:01:19.439> to

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.039 
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
hold<00:01:19.799> down<00:01:19.890> shift<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.869> I'm<00:01:21.869> going<00:01:21.990> to

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
hold down shift and I'm going to

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.600 
hold down shift and I'm going to
right-click<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.560> armature<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.520> a

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
right-click the armature so it is a

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.969 
right-click the armature so it is a
lighter<00:01:23.939> color<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.560> then<00:01:25.560> I'm<00:01:25.680> going<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.830> hit

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
lighter color and then I'm going to hit

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.160 
lighter color and then I'm going to hit
ctrl<00:01:26.460> P<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.270> parent<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:29.479> mesh<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:31.049> the

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
ctrl P to parent the mesh to the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.010 
ctrl P to parent the mesh to the
armature<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:32.060> I'm<00:01:33.060> going<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.299> say<00:01:33.450> ok<00:01:33.630> set

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
armature and I'm going to say ok set

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.740 
armature and I'm going to say ok set
parent<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.040> i'm<00:01:35.820> going<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.030> use<00:01:36.180> automatic

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
parent to and i'm going to use automatic

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.490 
parent to and i'm going to use automatic
waits<00:01:37.200> for<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:37.740> alright<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:39.259> that's<00:01:40.259> going

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
waits for this alright and that's going

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.730 
waits for this alright and that's going
to<00:01:40.560> allow<00:01:40.680> our<00:01:40.829> armature<00:01:41.430> now<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:42.740> control

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
to allow our armature now to control

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.219 
to allow our armature now to control
this<00:01:43.920> mesh<00:01:44.250> now<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.820> lot<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.420> times<00:01:45.630> if<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.110> have

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
this mesh now a lot of times if you have

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.260 
this mesh now a lot of times if you have
a<00:01:46.259> complex<00:01:46.920> mesh<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.579> try<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.790> set<00:01:48.119> an

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
a complex mesh and you try to set an

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.740 
a complex mesh and you try to set an
armature<00:01:48.930> structure<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.329> using<00:01:51.329> automatic

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
armature structure to it using automatic

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.210 
armature structure to it using automatic
weights<00:01:52.110> you'll<00:01:52.350> get<00:01:52.470> some<00:01:52.649> deformities<00:01:53.189> and

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
weights you'll get some deformities and

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.910 
weights you'll get some deformities and
it<00:01:53.399> won't<00:01:53.520> quite<00:01:53.759> look<00:01:54.090> right<00:01:54.380> you<00:01:55.380> can<00:01:55.619> select

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
it won't quite look right you can select

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.819 
it won't quite look right you can select
your<00:01:56.250> mesh<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:57.000> can<00:01:57.180> go<00:01:57.299> into<00:01:57.509> edit<00:01:57.750> mode<00:01:57.960> you

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
your mesh you can go into edit mode you

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.560 
your mesh you can go into edit mode you
know<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.219> over<00:02:00.060> here<00:02:00.090> where<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.450> object

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
know and over here where the object

know and over here where the object
properties<00:02:01.439> are<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:02.310> can<00:02:02.520> select<00:02:02.759> specific

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
properties are you can select specific

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.270 
properties are you can select specific
vertices<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.140> maybe<00:02:04.560> aren't<00:02:04.799> working<00:02:05.189> or

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
vertices that maybe aren't working or

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.370 
vertices that maybe aren't working or
aren't<00:02:05.520> assigned<00:02:05.820> correctly<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.600> over<00:02:07.229> here

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.740 
aren't assigned correctly and over here
on<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.619> right<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:08.819> can<00:02:09.030> assign<00:02:09.509> different

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
on the right you can assign different

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.080 
on the right you can assign different
vertex<00:02:10.289> groups<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:11.190> can<00:02:11.370> change<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.970> way

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
vertex groups and you can change the way

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.460 
vertex groups and you can change the way
those<00:02:12.270> vertices<00:02:12.629> behave<00:02:13.050> so

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
those vertices behave so

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.770 
those vertices behave so
if<00:02:13.560> you<00:02:14.010> see<00:02:14.220> deformities<00:02:14.820> after<00:02:15.240> parenting

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
if you see deformities after parenting

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.290 
if you see deformities after parenting
an<00:02:15.900> object<00:02:16.320> to<00:02:16.560> an<00:02:16.650> armature<00:02:16.950> with<00:02:17.790> automatic

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
an object to an armature with automatic

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:25.030 
an object to an armature with automatic
weights<00:02:19.940> over<00:02:20.940> here<00:02:22.130> inside<00:02:23.130> of<00:02:23.190> our<00:02:23.570> object

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
weights over here inside of our object

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.210 
weights over here inside of our object
data<00:02:26.360> field<00:02:27.360> we<00:02:28.050> can<00:02:28.260> sort<00:02:28.470> of<00:02:28.560> modify<00:02:28.920> some<00:02:29.190> of

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
data field we can sort of modify some of

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.530 
data field we can sort of modify some of
that<00:02:29.400> so<00:02:29.520> that's<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.730> good<00:02:29.850> place<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.270> look<00:02:30.390> if

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
that so that's a good place to look if

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.780 
that so that's a good place to look if
you're<00:02:30.630> not<00:02:30.750> happy<00:02:30.990> with<00:02:31.200> what<00:02:31.530> happens<00:02:31.920> after

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
you're not happy with what happens after

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.550 
you're not happy with what happens after
parenting<00:02:33.240> ok<00:02:33.720> so<00:02:34.380> I'm<00:02:35.220> going<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.370> go<00:02:35.490> into

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
parenting ok so I'm going to go into

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.480 
parenting ok so I'm going to go into
object<00:02:37.560> mode<00:02:37.590> i'm<00:02:37.920> going<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.100> select<00:02:38.310> my

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
object mode i'm going to select my

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.550 
object mode i'm going to select my
armature<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.210> here's<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:40.050> kind<00:02:40.410> of<00:02:40.470> an

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
armature and here's a kind of an

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.150 
armature and here's a kind of an
important<00:02:41.720> point<00:02:42.720> i<00:02:42.930> guess<00:02:42.960> is<00:02:43.470> i<00:02:43.590> can<00:02:43.800> see<00:02:44.040> the

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
important point i guess is i can see the

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.740 
important point i guess is i can see the
armature<00:02:44.580> it's<00:02:44.760> actually<00:02:45.150> inside<00:02:45.510> of<00:02:45.690> the

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
armature it's actually inside of the

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.890 
armature it's actually inside of the
model<00:02:46.130> that's<00:02:47.130> because<00:02:47.550> i<00:02:47.580> have<00:02:48.060> right<00:02:48.720> down

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
model that's because i have right down

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.470 
model that's because i have right down
here<00:02:49.140> i<00:02:49.320> have<00:02:49.830> x<00:02:50.100> ray<00:02:50.220> checked<00:02:50.670> all<00:02:51.120> right<00:02:51.270> and

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
here i have x ray checked all right and

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.180 
here i have x ray checked all right and
that<00:02:51.870> allows<00:02:52.080> us<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.440> see<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.650> armature

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
that allows us to see the armature

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.480 
that allows us to see the armature
through<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:54.180> mesh<00:02:54.470> ok<00:02:55.470> so<00:02:55.980> I'm<00:02:56.070> going<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.250> drop

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
through the mesh ok so I'm going to drop

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.460 
through the mesh ok so I'm going to drop
into<00:02:56.820> pose<00:02:57.480> mode<00:02:57.780> now<00:02:58.370> and<00:02:59.370> I'm<00:02:59.490> going<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.640> grab

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
into pose mode now and I'm going to grab

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.930 
into pose mode now and I'm going to grab
this<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.740> you<00:03:01.830> can<00:03:01.860> see<00:03:02.220> that<00:03:02.459> if<00:03:02.580> I<00:03:02.670> try<00:03:02.910> to

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
this and you can see that if I try to

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.760 
this and you can see that if I try to
rotate<00:03:03.209> it<00:03:03.570> you<00:03:03.720> know<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:03.990> mesh<00:03:04.260> is<00:03:04.560> going<00:03:04.709> to

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
rotate it you know the mesh is going to

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.560 
rotate it you know the mesh is going to
move<00:03:04.950> with<00:03:05.310> that<00:03:05.730> are<00:03:05.940> mature<00:03:06.240> after

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
move with that are mature after

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.199 
move with that are mature after
parenting<00:03:06.959> it<00:03:07.459> all<00:03:08.459> right<00:03:08.610> let's<00:03:08.790> create<00:03:09.060> an

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
parenting it all right let's create an

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.449 
parenting it all right let's create an
animation<00:03:09.570> down<00:03:10.470> here<00:03:10.650> at<00:03:10.740> the<00:03:10.800> bottom<00:03:10.860> I'm

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
animation down here at the bottom I'm

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.140 
animation down here at the bottom I'm
going<00:03:11.910> to<00:03:12.000> choose<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.570> dope<00:03:12.990> sheet<00:03:13.940> all<00:03:14.940> right

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
going to choose the dope sheet all right

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.580 
going to choose the dope sheet all right
and<00:03:15.440> I'm<00:03:16.440> going<00:03:16.740> to<00:03:16.770> choose<00:03:17.160> action<00:03:18.000> editor

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
and I'm going to choose action editor

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.229 
and I'm going to choose action editor
down<00:03:19.590> at<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:19.830> bottom<00:03:19.980> like<00:03:20.280> this<00:03:20.310> ok<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.150> this

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
down at the bottom like this ok and this

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.240 
down at the bottom like this ok and this
is<00:03:21.390> where<00:03:21.540> we're<00:03:21.630> going<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.810> create<00:03:22.250> our

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
is where we're going to create our

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.699 
is where we're going to create our
animation<00:03:23.910> ok<00:03:24.480> so<00:03:25.050> I'm<00:03:25.170> going<00:03:25.290> to<00:03:25.350> start<00:03:25.440> with

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
animation ok so I'm going to start with

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.850 
animation ok so I'm going to start with
one<00:03:25.950> leg<00:03:26.190> here<00:03:27.090> ok<00:03:27.720> and<00:03:27.900> I'm<00:03:28.440> going<00:03:28.470> to<00:03:28.620> hit<00:03:28.709> I

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
one leg here ok and I'm going to hit I

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.550 
one leg here ok and I'm going to hit I
to<00:03:29.370> insert<00:03:29.700> a<00:03:29.760> keyframe<00:03:29.910> and<00:03:30.420> it's<00:03:31.260> going<00:03:31.440> to

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
to insert a keyframe and it's going to

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.940 
to insert a keyframe and it's going to
be<00:03:31.800> a<00:03:31.830> location<00:03:32.780> rotation<00:03:33.780> keyframe<00:03:34.470> just

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
be a location rotation keyframe just

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.680 
be a location rotation keyframe just
like<00:03:35.100> that<00:03:35.310> and<00:03:35.970> we're<00:03:36.120> going<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.269> start<00:03:36.510> the

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
like that and we're going to start the

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.229 
like that and we're going to start the
first<00:03:36.959> leg<00:03:37.230> in<00:03:37.489> this<00:03:38.489> position<00:03:39.000> we're<00:03:39.209> going

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
first leg in this position we're going

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.750 
first leg in this position we're going
to<00:03:39.390> create<00:03:39.570> a<00:03:39.660> loop<00:03:39.870> here<00:03:40.250> i'm<00:03:41.250> going<00:03:41.459> to<00:03:41.519> use

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
to create a loop here i'm going to use

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.640 
to create a loop here i'm going to use
our<00:03:42.330> to<00:03:42.750> rotate<00:03:43.140> i'm<00:03:43.260> going<00:03:43.380> to<00:03:43.470> be<00:03:43.530> very

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
our to rotate i'm going to be very

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.070 
our to rotate i'm going to be very
specific<00:03:43.860> i'm<00:03:44.280> gonna<00:03:44.400> hit<00:03:44.459> our<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:45.090> i'm<00:03:45.989> going

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
specific i'm gonna hit our and i'm going

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.420 
specific i'm gonna hit our and i'm going
to<00:03:46.140> rotate<00:03:46.320> it<00:03:46.620> by<00:03:46.650> let's<00:03:46.920> say<00:03:46.980> let's<00:03:47.250> see<00:03:47.370> how

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
to rotate it by let's say let's see how

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.759 
to rotate it by let's say let's see how
40<00:03:47.880> works<00:03:48.060> 40<00:03:49.070> ok<00:03:50.239> kind<00:03:51.239> of<00:03:51.330> extreme<00:03:51.720> but<00:03:52.680> i'm

going to lock that rotation to this
particular<00:04:05.790> key<00:04:06.209> frame<00:04:06.480> using<00:04:06.660> I<00:04:07.019> and<00:04:07.320> then

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
particular key frame using I and then

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.370 
particular key frame using I and then
LOC<00:04:08.340> our<00:04:08.519> OT<00:04:08.850> and<00:04:09.090> you<00:04:09.600> can<00:04:09.720> see<00:04:09.930> it<00:04:10.019> created

LOC our OT and you can see it created
two<00:04:10.530> keyframes<00:04:10.769> here<00:04:11.360> then<00:04:12.360> I'm<00:04:12.420> going<00:04:12.510> to

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
two keyframes here then I'm going to

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.420 
two keyframes here then I'm going to
move<00:04:12.690> to<00:04:12.750> frame<00:04:13.080> 20<00:04:13.530> and<00:04:13.739> I'm<00:04:13.950> going<00:04:14.100> to<00:04:14.160> put<00:04:14.340> it

move to frame 20 and I'm going to put it

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.120 
move to frame 20 and I'm going to put it
back<00:04:14.640> and<00:04:15.000> I'm<00:04:15.720> using<00:04:15.930> specific<00:04:16.260> numbers<00:04:16.919> here

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
back and I'm using specific numbers here

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.320

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.330 
going to choose my walk animation

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.029 
going to choose my walk animation
okay<00:06:34.419> and<00:06:34.780> you've<00:06:35.139> got<00:06:35.289> to<00:06:35.409> choose<00:06:35.560> your<00:06:35.740> start

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:36.039 
okay and you've got to choose your start

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:37.529 
okay and you've got to choose your start
frame<00:06:36.310> in<00:06:36.460> your<00:06:36.580> end<00:06:36.699> frame<00:06:36.970> so<00:06:37.120> in<00:06:37.240> this<00:06:37.330> case

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:37.539 
frame in your end frame so in this case

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:38.839 
frame in your end frame so in this case
we're<00:06:37.750> going<00:06:37.780> to<00:06:37.900> start<00:06:38.139> in<00:06:38.169> frame<00:06:38.379> 1<00:06:38.560> and

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:38.849 
we're going to start in frame 1 and

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:41.520 
we're going to start in frame 1 and
we're<00:06:39.849> going<00:06:39.970> to<00:06:40.000> end<00:06:40.180> in<00:06:40.509> frame<00:06:40.810> 20<00:06:41.349> and

we're going to end in frame 20 and

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:45.350 
we're going to end in frame 20 and
that's<00:06:41.710> what's<00:06:41.889> going<00:06:41.979> to<00:06:42.069> loop<00:06:43.830> okay<00:06:44.830> and

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 
that's what's going to loop okay and

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.149 
that's what's going to loop okay and
that<00:06:46.360> should<00:06:46.750> do<00:06:47.020> it<00:06:47.050> okay<00:06:47.439> so<00:06:47.500> for<00:06:47.860> the<00:06:47.919> key

00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:48.159 
that should do it okay so for the key

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:49.709 
that should do it okay so for the key
i'm<00:06:48.370> just<00:06:48.550> going<00:06:48.669> to<00:06:48.729> make<00:06:48.819> it<00:06:48.969> the<00:06:49.060> W<00:06:49.509> key

00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:49.719 
i'm just going to make it the W key

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:51.420 
i'm just going to make it the W key
because<00:06:49.990> that's<00:06:50.229> the<00:06:50.409> key<00:06:50.560> i'm<00:06:50.650> also<00:06:50.830> using<00:06:51.009> to

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.430 
because that's the key i'm also using to

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.600 
because that's the key i'm also using to
move<00:06:51.550> this<00:06:51.699> model<00:06:52.060> forward<00:06:52.389> right<00:06:52.539> now

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:53.610 
move this model forward right now

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.589 
move this model forward right now
alright<00:06:54.610> and<00:06:54.819> i'm<00:06:55.060> going<00:06:55.180> to<00:06:55.240> connect<00:06:55.539> the

the camera and if i hit p to play the
game<00:07:12.060> let's<00:07:13.060> go<00:07:13.210> into<00:07:13.569> object<00:07:14.020> mode<00:07:14.050> and<00:07:14.319> try

00:07:14.339 --> 00:07:14.349 
game let's go into object mode and try

00:07:14.349 --> 00:07:16.709 
game let's go into object mode and try
it<00:07:14.669> never<00:07:15.669> go<00:07:15.819> pee<00:07:16.030> to<00:07:16.120> play<00:07:16.270> the<00:07:16.389> game<00:07:16.509> and<00:07:16.659> i

00:07:16.709 --> 00:07:16.719 
it never go pee to play the game and i

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:19.100 
it never go pee to play the game and i
hit<00:07:16.870> w<00:07:17.349> you<00:07:17.889> can<00:07:17.919> see<00:07:18.219> that<00:07:18.400> that<00:07:18.430> animation

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:19.110 
hit w you can see that that animation

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:24.420 
hit w you can see that that animation
takes<00:07:20.110> place<00:07:20.879> within<00:07:21.879> the<00:07:22.120> game<00:07:23.009> it's<00:07:24.009> not<00:07:24.280> the

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:24.430 
takes place within the game it's not the

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.129 
takes place within the game it's not the
best<00:07:24.550> animation<00:07:25.030> in<00:07:25.240> the<00:07:25.270> world<00:07:25.479> and<00:07:25.690> you<00:07:26.020> can

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:26.139 
best animation in the world and you can

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:27.659 
best animation in the world and you can
see<00:07:26.319> that<00:07:26.349> i<00:07:26.500> don't<00:07:26.770> have<00:07:26.949> it<00:07:26.979> linked<00:07:27.370> up<00:07:27.460> right

00:07:27.659 --> 00:07:27.669 
see that i don't have it linked up right

00:07:27.669 --> 00:07:30.480 
see that i don't have it linked up right
now<00:07:27.819> to<00:07:27.879> go<00:07:28.060> backwards<00:07:28.479> as<00:07:28.629> well<00:07:28.810> but<00:07:29.710> you<00:07:30.400> know

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:30.490 
now to go backwards as well but you know

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:32.459 
now to go backwards as well but you know
simple<00:07:30.940> animations<00:07:31.449> like<00:07:31.659> that<00:07:31.900> or<00:07:32.080> any<00:07:32.289> kind

00:07:32.459 --> 00:07:32.469 
simple animations like that or any kind

00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:35.420 
simple animations like that or any kind
of<00:07:32.590> an<00:07:32.710> animation<00:07:33.039> that's<00:07:33.400> linked<00:07:33.699> up<00:07:33.819> to<00:07:34.289> and

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:35.430 
of an animation that's linked up to and

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:38.100 
of an animation that's linked up to and
you<00:07:36.430> know<00:07:36.520> a<00:07:36.550> sensor<00:07:36.969> like<00:07:37.000> a<00:07:37.210> keyboard<00:07:37.870> key

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:38.110 
you know a sensor like a keyboard key

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.890 
you know a sensor like a keyboard key
can<00:07:38.770> be<00:07:38.800> useful<00:07:39.340> when<00:07:39.969> creating<00:07:40.210> a<00:07:40.389> game<00:07:40.539> so

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:40.900 
can be useful when creating a game so

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.110 
can be useful when creating a game so
