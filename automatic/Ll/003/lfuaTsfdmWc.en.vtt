00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
only want to copy the data to do this I

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.170 
only want to copy the data to do this I
scroll<00:00:50.350> down<00:00:50.379> to<00:00:50.860> set<00:00:51.040> up<00:00:51.190> in<00:00:51.400> the<00:00:51.519> menu<00:00:51.670> option

this<00:00:56.830> way<00:00:57.040> the<00:00:57.190> copy<00:00:57.400> will<00:00:57.670> go<00:00:57.790> much<00:00:58.000> faster

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:58.299 
this way the copy will go much faster

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:01.079 
this way the copy will go much faster
now<00:00:58.809> I<00:00:59.650> go<00:00:59.860> to<00:00:59.920> the<00:01:00.100> first<00:01:00.339> menu<00:01:00.610> option<00:01:01.059> and

now I go to the first menu option and
copy<00:01:01.449> and<00:01:01.869> push<00:01:02.110> ok<00:01:02.500> it'll<00:01:03.280> take<00:01:03.489> just<00:01:03.519> a

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
copy and push ok it'll take just a

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.820 
copy and push ok it'll take just a
moment<00:01:04.000> to<00:01:04.299> search<00:01:04.600> for<00:01:04.869> the<00:01:04.989> source<00:01:05.229> and<00:01:05.650> to

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
moment to search for the source and to

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.250 
moment to search for the source and to
analyze<00:01:06.250> it<00:01:06.580> the<00:01:07.420> hard<00:01:07.630> drive<00:01:07.810> duplicator

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
analyze it the hard drive duplicator

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.230 
analyze it the hard drive duplicator
quickly<00:01:08.890> analyzes<00:01:09.640> all<00:01:09.880> the<00:01:10.150> partitions<00:01:12.240> it

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
quickly analyzes all the partitions it

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.929 
quickly analyzes all the partitions it
appears<00:01:13.960> that<00:01:14.049> I<00:01:14.229> have<00:01:14.439> about<00:01:14.740> 12<00:01:15.189> gig<00:01:15.549> of<00:01:15.729> data

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
appears that I have about 12 gig of data

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.660 
appears that I have about 12 gig of data
on<00:01:16.150> my<00:01:16.299> source<00:01:16.600> hard<00:01:16.869> drive<00:01:17.110> the<00:01:17.979> copy<00:01:18.250> speed

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
on my source hard drive the copy speed

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.389 
on my source hard drive the copy speed
is<00:01:18.939> a<00:01:19.000> 90<00:01:19.509> megabytes<00:01:20.079> per<00:01:20.259> second<00:01:20.979> so<00:01:21.250> it

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
is a 90 megabytes per second so it

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:23.340 
is a 90 megabytes per second so it
should<00:01:21.609> take<00:01:21.640> about<00:01:22.030> two<00:01:22.420> and<00:01:22.659> a<00:01:22.719> half<00:01:22.899> minutes

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
should take about two and a half minutes

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.490 
should take about two and a half minutes
to<00:01:23.469> copy<00:01:23.770> all<00:01:24.130> the<00:01:24.310> data<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:26.049> looks<00:01:26.229> like<00:01:26.380> the
