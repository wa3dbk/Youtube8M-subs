stickers<00:00:19.439> because<00:00:19.650> when<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.010> cube<00:00:20.250> is

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
stickers because when the cube is

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.590 
stickers because when the cube is
scrambled<00:00:20.820> it<00:00:20.939> looks<00:00:21.119> amazing<00:00:23.359> the<00:00:24.359> shank

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
scrambled it looks amazing the shank

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.470 
scrambled it looks amazing the shank
shell<00:00:24.779> 7<00:00:25.080> by<00:00:25.170> 7<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.590> 77<00:00:26.310> millimeters<00:00:26.880> whereas

the o foo is 78 however with the

pillowed miss the Ovoo seems a lot

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.889 
pillowed miss the Ovoo seems a lot
smaller<00:00:32.090> however<00:00:33.090> if<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.300> compare<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.809> the

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
smaller however if you compare it to the

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.740 
smaller however if you compare it to the
mini<00:00:34.079> shangzhou<00:00:34.410> 7<00:00:34.860> by<00:00:34.980> 7<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:36.149> oaf<00:00:36.329> who<00:00:36.510> seems

mini shangzhou 7 by 7 the oaf who seems

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.750 
mini shangzhou 7 by 7 the oaf who seems
a<00:00:36.899> lot<00:00:37.140> larger<00:00:37.380> despite<00:00:37.980> its<00:00:38.219> pillared<00:00:38.579> ness

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
a lot larger despite its pillared ness

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.610 
a lot larger despite its pillared ness
and<00:00:38.940> i<00:00:39.090> personally<00:00:39.540> prefer<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:40.110> size<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.500> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
and i personally prefer the size of the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.950 
and i personally prefer the size of the
mini<00:00:40.770> shank<00:00:41.129> shell<00:00:41.420> the<00:00:42.420> best<00:00:42.629> way<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:42.809> can

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
mini shank shell the best way I can

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.600 
mini shank shell the best way I can
describe<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.469> turning<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.920> this<00:00:44.040> puzzle<00:00:44.250> is

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
describe the turning of this puzzle is

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.959 
describe the turning of this puzzle is
very<00:00:45.090> very<00:00:45.390> very<00:00:45.629> smooth<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.379> dry<00:00:47.070> quite

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
very very very smooth and dry quite

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.420 
very very very smooth and dry quite
similar<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.840> mo<00:00:49.230> UO<00:00:49.440> su<00:00:49.890> before<00:00:50.129> it's

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
similar to the mo UO su before it's

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.479 
similar to the mo UO su before it's
broken<00:00:50.789> in<00:00:50.989> the<00:00:51.989> puzzles<00:00:52.350> also<00:00:52.680> decently<00:00:53.160> fast

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
broken in the puzzles also decently fast

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.479 
broken in the puzzles also decently fast
however<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.300> was<00:00:54.660> much<00:00:54.840> used<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.379> faster<00:00:55.770> 7x7

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
however I was much used to it faster 7x7

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.819 
however I was much used to it faster 7x7
so<00:00:56.940> for<00:00:57.120> me<00:00:57.270> this<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.629> not<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.109> fastest<00:00:58.590> cube

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
so for me this is not the fastest cube

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.709 
so for me this is not the fastest cube
but<00:00:59.399> for<00:00:59.550> most<00:00:59.670> people<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.239> would<00:01:00.329> be<00:01:00.359> good

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
but for most people it would be good

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.439 
but for most people it would be good
enough<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.260> do<00:01:02.219> get<00:01:02.520> pops<00:01:02.760> on<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.120> cube

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
enough I do get pops on this cube

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.969 
enough I do get pops on this cube
however<00:01:04.140> most<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.500> time<00:01:04.559> it's<00:01:04.830> not

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
however most of the time it's not

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.270 
however most of the time it's not
explosions<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:06.299> on<00:01:06.420> occasion<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.110> get

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
explosions but on occasion I get

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.130 
explosions but on occasion I get
explosion<00:01:08.280> similar<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.909> this<00:01:09.030> one<00:01:09.299> but<00:01:09.960> for

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
explosion similar to this one but for

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.140 
explosion similar to this one but for
the<00:01:10.200> most<00:01:10.409> part<00:01:10.650> it's<00:01:10.799> just<00:01:10.950> popped<00:01:11.340> looking

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
the most part it's just popped looking

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.789 
the most part it's just popped looking
at<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.360> mechanism<00:01:12.510> compared<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.470> mo<00:01:13.590> UO

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
at the mechanism compared to the mo UO

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.070 
at the mechanism compared to the mo UO
sue<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.939> can<00:01:15.090> see<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.420> they<00:01:15.540> kind<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.869> look

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
sue you can see that they kind of look

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.170 
sue you can see that they kind of look
similar<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.250> think<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.670> mechanism

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
similar so I think that the mechanism

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.590 
similar so I think that the mechanism
was<00:01:18.360> based<00:01:18.630> off<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.049> 4x4<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.790> obviously

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
was based off of that 4x4 so obviously

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.020 
was based off of that 4x4 so obviously
this<00:01:22.380> mechanism<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:23.070> pretty<00:01:23.310> good<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:23.909> don't

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
this mechanism is pretty good so I don't

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.030 
this mechanism is pretty good so I don't
think<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.479> pops<00:01:24.689> are<00:01:24.930> due<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.409> mechanism

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
think the pops are due to the mechanism

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.950 
think the pops are due to the mechanism
but<00:01:26.520> more<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.850> my<00:01:27.000> turning<00:01:27.390> style<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.869> the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
but more of my turning style and the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.870 
but more of my turning style and the
size<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.380> puzzle<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.920> trying<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.640> put<00:01:29.790> the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
size of the puzzle and trying to put the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.609 
size of the puzzle and trying to put the
pieces<00:01:30.090> back<00:01:30.299> into<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.810> puzzle<00:01:31.020> if<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.409> pops

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
pieces back into the puzzle if it pops

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.340 
pieces back into the puzzle if it pops
is<00:01:32.009> not<00:01:32.340> easy<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.150> can<00:01:33.420> take<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.630> lot<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.020> time

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
is not easy and can take a lot of time

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.710 
is not easy and can take a lot of time
within<00:01:34.860> yourself<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.970> corner<00:01:36.299> cutting<00:01:36.479> and

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
within yourself the corner cutting and

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.600 
within yourself the corner cutting and
all<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.140> layers<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.680> Oh<00:01:37.710> foo<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.310> very

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
all of the layers of the Oh foo is very

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.160 
all of the layers of the Oh foo is very
good<00:01:38.880> however<00:01:39.450> if<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.630> try<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.930> go<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.079> little

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
good however if you try to go a little

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.649 
good however if you try to go a little
too<00:01:40.500> far<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.829> might<00:01:41.009> pop<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:42.090> main<00:01:42.270> problem

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
too far it might pop the main problem

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:43.969 
too far it might pop the main problem
I've<00:01:42.810> had<00:01:42.960> with<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.200> puzzle<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.740> outer

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
I've had with this puzzle is the outer

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.310 
I've had with this puzzle is the outer
layers<00:01:44.310> during<00:01:45.240> last<00:01:45.540> four<00:01:45.810> edges<00:01:45.960> and

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
layers during last four edges and

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.990 
layers during last four edges and
through<00:01:46.649> back<00:01:46.799> three-stage<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.430> tend<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.820> lose

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
through back three-stage I tend to lose

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.270 
through back three-stage I tend to lose
grip<00:01:48.299> on<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.570> outer<00:01:48.720> layers<00:01:49.020> due<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.040> size

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
grip on the outer layers due to the size

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.120 
grip on the outer layers due to the size
of<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.520> puzzle<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.210> pillowed<00:01:51.570> nests

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
of the puzzle and the pillowed nests

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.830 
of the puzzle and the pillowed nests
originally<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.340> said<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:54.060> Pilipinas<00:01:54.479> wasn't

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
originally I said the Pilipinas wasn't

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.469 
originally I said the Pilipinas wasn't
very<00:01:54.960> noticeable<00:01:55.560> but<00:01:56.280> when<00:01:56.700> using<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.299> I

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
very noticeable but when using it I

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.690 
very noticeable but when using it I
noticed<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:58.020> lot<00:01:58.259> now<00:01:58.500> as<00:01:59.130> far<00:01:59.610> as

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
noticed it a lot now as far as

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.580 
noticed it a lot now as far as
recommendations<00:02:00.450> go<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.960> would<00:02:01.320> still

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
recommendations go I would still

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.050 
recommendations go I would still
recommend<00:02:01.740> this<00:02:02.100> puzzle<00:02:02.460> even<00:02:02.729> though<00:02:02.969> it

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
recommend this puzzle even though it

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.240 
recommend this puzzle even though it
does<00:02:03.210> have<00:02:03.390> some<00:02:03.630> popping<00:02:04.049> issues<00:02:04.380> but<00:02:05.100> those

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
does have some popping issues but those

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.469 
does have some popping issues but those
can<00:02:05.460> just<00:02:05.610> be<00:02:05.729> resolved<00:02:06.180> with<00:02:06.329> some

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
can just be resolved with some

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.749 
can just be resolved with some
tensioning<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.140> I<00:02:08.069> think<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.550> outer

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
tensioning and I think that the outer

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.460 
tensioning and I think that the outer
layers<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.539> can<00:02:09.720> get<00:02:09.840> used<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.229> if<00:02:10.349> you

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
layers you can get used to if you

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.100 
layers you can get used to if you
practice<00:02:10.979> using<00:02:11.160> this<00:02:11.370> cube<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.849> still<00:02:12.810> use<00:02:12.989> the

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
practice using this cube I still use the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.670 
practice using this cube I still use the
mini<00:02:13.290> change

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
mini change

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.649 
mini change
by<00:02:14.040> seven<00:02:14.340> but<00:02:14.819> that<00:02:14.969> doesn't<00:02:15.269> take<00:02:15.420> away<00:02:15.450> from

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
by seven but that doesn't take away from

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.300 
by seven but that doesn't take away from
the<00:02:15.870> fact<00:02:16.140> that<00:02:16.230> this<00:02:16.379> cube<00:02:16.620> has<00:02:16.769> amazing

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
the fact that this cube has amazing

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.770 
the fact that this cube has amazing
turning<00:02:17.670> that<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:17.819> think<00:02:18.090> many<00:02:18.269> people<00:02:18.359> would

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
turning that I think many people would

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.770 
turning that I think many people would
enjoy<00:02:19.459> so<00:02:20.459> that's<00:02:20.640> all<00:02:20.790> for<00:02:20.909> my<00:02:21.060> review<00:02:21.450> on<00:02:21.659> the
