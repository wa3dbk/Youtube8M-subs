00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.869
 Hello and this is the first video on my new channel 

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:14.419
 on this channel I will not short a video 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.419
 over the three quarters Schroeder the Michael Preetz 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:23.569
 and the accessories games and stuff 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:25.899
 Heidrun Bluhm of this console 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:29.060
 and today I start with the DRS 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.150
 and I have a bit of bad luck 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.170
 money 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.170
 3 around Amazon 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.390
 and the splendid France surfaced 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.460
 Of course, I have often so it is so dark here 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.540
 this is the light 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.120
 the App Store or for the DS 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.220
 BZ that is 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.900
 very newest 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.900
 and I'll introduce you soon 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.490
 Hanna still 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.770
 from the dealer Bulls but ordered from Amazon 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.770
 from consoles almost 100 days 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.490
 with whom I know and to start here 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.450
 according to typical Franconian line Kraft 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.640
 Sima cost around 99 and thus postage 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.570
 keep a euro 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.570
 97 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.590
 June was the animal value you do not know is the Action Appel that is 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.050
 Target module for low DRS 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.050
 and that is easier 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.850
 here it is already on it French German and English 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.000
 the 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.850
 Rector Prof 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.250
 There is also a bit of description here, but that's nothing 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.250
 is more important 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.990
 in this part 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.370
 all nonsense 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.200
 TSB Kara 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.259
 which one can later connect to the computer 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.759
 and new lows trusts seven fireplaces or Poldi version wants to be blessed 

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:16.629
 already thought 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.709
 this CD 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.009
 This is a manager for the commitments for the whole Kids Themann 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:26.799
 installed on the computer it is compatible with Windows XP 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:32.099
 like industry minister and that's why I think so too 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:35.689
 when new construction is for Mac 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:38.689
 I do not know how compatible that is 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.949
 for each of these Antakya 

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:46.390
 that's very nice 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.460
 This also makes it easy to understand in Germany 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.459
 Not everything really sounds very well explained 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:57.659
 so then come in the main square 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.259
 BGKS card 

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:04.259
 Euro by 7 1 percent is the connection 

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:06.589
 through the cables 

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:08.899
 when Mans Cup kick 

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:10.889
 that's what it looks like 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.569
 so I'm on my knee now 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.359
 if DS 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.659
 Under one has the whole mostly about a child many too 

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:24.509
 thanks to numbers 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:28.260
 then comes this screen and thanks it starts immediately 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:34.479
 No, he is these states 

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:36.209
 we are left so 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.889
 at night the top four sinks 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:42.529
 and then comes the cheap player Unity achieved Animal Crossing Europe 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.849
 you are limited by that 

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:52.069
 Markets here which games are going on 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:54.999
 not Animal Crossing 

00:03:54.999 --> 00:04:00.409
 and for most players to deepest known and Pipe and most games 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.869
 There are already the deepest rough 

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:06.629
 so now I'm going to mourn here 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.629
 because then you can have any kid up here 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.799
 we have to go now 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.079
 March Elz is why 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:17.829
 technically the same can be demonstrated 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.049
 that they are still others that are now and not so much but you can 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.909
 get new print later 

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:27.159
 because it is also state here 

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:30.159
 and then starts all over in Abruzzo 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.729
 and this 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.969
 Play Action Replay Modules with almost everyone 

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:39.289
 compatible 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:42.289
 to make the object we do here 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.210
 continue 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.699
 to be produced 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:14.719
 we are looking for life here 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:19.159
 Goch now counteracts the same Minsk blackout computer market Stitz 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.650
 percent 

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:29.069
 For example, here and now we can 

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:33.529
 Costs go 

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:35.729
 Pinotti is no doubt 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:39.050
 that would be the now 99 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.159
 Krumbach here 

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:43.999
 ten down 

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:46.999
 we still have 99 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.330
 make as long as you want 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.330
 So you can be who much 

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:58.449
 so that was once unique miners 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:05:59.289
 on 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:00.979
 one of the best draws 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:05.210
 Tietz and AndrÃ© Fischer Ahlen are already on the field 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.960
 Butterflies and all 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.550
 he also paddles insects and other teams more often 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.090
 but that would be and Umland Werder players make no sense anymore 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:19.740
 and therefore 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.169
 at night the most meaningful if you feel like it or Aids Institute 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:28.610
 and that brings in a lot of people is not going to come to the city hall for a short time 

00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:35.999
 I do not have that much yet 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.889
 I can show you this I have that 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:42.719
 now somehow today 

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:44.439
 I believe 

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:46.729
 Had 30 minutes 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:48.839
 and played with 

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:52.189
 Mintal so fast 

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:54.809
 like millions a million 

00:06:54.809 --> 00:06:56.490
 all 1 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.490
 4 

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:05.169
 and that's a lot if you always like that 

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:07.569
 Chairman Wolfgang Hartmann 2 

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:10.499
 nice little money can go 

00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:13.499
 Credit card numbers and such 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.680
 that is for a very 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.649
 very nice as a compartment 

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:21.779
 and I'm for 10 euros 

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:22.819
 can you do that 

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:25.979
 by selection 

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:29.470
 as if Â«This was my first video I hope you liked it 

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:34.050
 If showed at a Grande is nice if you are not five stars 

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:36.050
 or 4 keep it up 

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.110
 rated 

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:41.510
 and also complains or writes a nice comment that would be very Met 

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.560
 also the many thanks 

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.630
 and that is first type
