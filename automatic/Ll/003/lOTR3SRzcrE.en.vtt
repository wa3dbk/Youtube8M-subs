00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:12.709
 here we are again again in order 

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:16.480
 I'll talk about dragon vol my favorite manga series 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.190
 it turns out that a child the madóz are goku comes to earth with two tails one 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:22.890
 hairy and other short 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.179
 then an old sissy likes it because of the two tails 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:31.399
 the child becomes a giant gorilla and crushes the old man yes yes clear and I 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:32.980
 I believe it 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.400
 that the child grows except the hairy tail and in this he knows bulma 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.560
 p like the old man I like the son goku this 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.840
 he knows quilín or also called billiard ball and the master mutenroshi a 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.370
 passionate about women's magazines 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.120
 grows grows and grows in this that you cut your hairy tail 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.970
 and I think it hurt a little 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.860
 in the second saga the series changes a lot 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.739
 I do not know where they appear from but 400 enemies come out every minute 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.420
 and coincidentally they have the same strength as the Japanese very sharp protagonist 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.090
 what breaks me is that those who are fighting look at each other longer than they 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.990
 fight 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.770
 you should like it a lot 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.620
 some take light from their hands or eyes and recharge the battery at night 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.370
 the poor are goku he has no friends he is so marginalized that he hits the whole world 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.100
 he only lives to eat 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.980
 and his wife is a slut 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.510
 to know why it has the name chichi 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.960
 very suspicious 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.460
 the are goku vegeta and all these must spend a lot of money on hair and dye 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.790
 with yellow hair 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.910
 I think that's how they create a country 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.100
 the names of the enemies translated into Spanish are real trash 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.950
 for example 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.490
 frizer in spanish is your brother freezer culer that is cold or something and 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.320
 the father that brings meaning and cold 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.400
 he is also luque is slug I drank he is baby 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.430
 they look like circus characters 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.660
 What I do not understand is that during the more than 300 chapters, thousands of 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.610
 uncles and when the series ends magically no longer appear 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.680
 what a coincidence my god that someone pinched me that I'm dreaming 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.749
 to end as always a joke 

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:13.729
 that is a boomerang that does not return 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:14.899
 a stick 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:17.089
 Hahaha 

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:20.479
 I have to put on a staple because I started laughing 

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:21.829
 xd xd 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:23.299
 I'm a breaker 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:24.029
 until another
