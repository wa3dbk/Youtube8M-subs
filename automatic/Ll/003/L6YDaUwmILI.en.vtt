tough<00:00:16.379> as<00:00:16.800> you<00:00:17.609> can<00:00:17.760> see<00:00:17.970> here<00:00:18.180> we<00:00:18.300> made<00:00:18.480> a

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
tough as you can see here we made a

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.810 
tough as you can see here we made a
block<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:19.170> think<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.980> lab<00:00:20.160> made<00:00:20.400> this<00:00:20.550> block

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
block I think the lab made this block

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.140 
block I think the lab made this block
about<00:00:21.090> thirty<00:00:21.510> years<00:00:21.689> ago<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.760> it's<00:00:23.760> still<00:00:24.029> in

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
about thirty years ago and it's still in

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.089 
about thirty years ago and it's still in
the<00:00:24.240> same<00:00:24.449> form<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:24.900> was<00:00:25.260> when<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.529> was<00:00:25.590> made

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
the same form that was when it was made

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.810 
the same form that was when it was made
drilled<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.119> tapped<00:00:28.130> has<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.160> screw<00:00:29.550> here<00:00:29.760> a

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
block it would have experienced enough

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.420 
block it would have experienced enough
shrinkage<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.809> enough<00:00:37.079> expansion<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:38.340> it

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
shrinkage and enough expansion that it

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.610 
shrinkage and enough expansion that it
would<00:00:38.550> have<00:00:38.640> cracked<00:00:38.969> but<00:00:39.809> this<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.110> great

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620

and<00:00:53.850> show<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.239> correct<00:00:54.510> way<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.809> to

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
and show you the correct way to to

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.189 
and show you the correct way to to
catalyze<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.370> product<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:57.449> uses<00:00:57.780> an<00:00:57.899> orange

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
catalyze the product it uses an orange

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.330 
catalyze the product it uses an orange
MEAP<00:00:58.879> which<00:00:59.879> is<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.719> same<00:01:01.020> as<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.379> clear<00:01:01.620> MEAP

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
MEAP which is the same as the clear MEAP

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.399 
MEAP which is the same as the clear MEAP
but<00:01:02.640> we<00:01:02.760> make<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.120> Orange<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:03.750> it's<00:01:03.930> easier<00:01:04.320> to

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
but we make it Orange so it's easier to

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.370 
but we make it Orange so it's easier to
see<00:01:04.589> when<00:01:04.799> we<00:01:04.890> mix<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.280> they<00:01:06.210> have<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.380> pushpin

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
see when we mix it they have a pushpin

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.399 
see when we mix it they have a pushpin
like<00:01:07.740> off<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.100> bulletin<00:01:08.369> board<00:01:09.020> we<00:01:10.020> make<00:01:10.260> the
