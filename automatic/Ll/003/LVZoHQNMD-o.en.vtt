this using my thing and I must say it's
really<00:01:14.490> good<00:01:14.990> if<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.170> have<00:01:16.319> a<00:01:16.350> good<00:01:16.530> grip<00:01:16.799> if

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
really good if you have a good grip if

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.249 
really good if you have a good grip if
the<00:01:17.819> angle<00:01:18.209> that<00:01:18.329> I<00:01:18.389> was<00:01:18.539> trying<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.840> put<00:01:18.990> on<00:01:19.109> my

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259
