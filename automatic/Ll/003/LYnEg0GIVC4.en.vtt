00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
pretty much every video that I use

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.369 
pretty much every video that I use
glitter<00:00:14.070> for<00:00:14.400> like<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.639> past<00:00:14.670> year<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.690> use

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
glitter for like the past year I use

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.870 
glitter for like the past year I use
this<00:00:16.710> which<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:18.500> eyeshadow<00:00:19.500> base<00:00:20.310> /

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
this which is the eyeshadow base /

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.420 
this which is the eyeshadow base /
sealer<00:00:21.420> from<00:00:21.600> la<00:00:21.930> splash<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.920> reason<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.250> like

sealer from la splash the reason I like

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.859 
sealer from la splash the reason I like
to<00:00:23.460> use<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:23.910> is<00:00:24.090> because<00:00:24.390> when<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:24.630> put<00:00:24.779> it

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
to use this is because when you put it

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.929 
to use this is because when you put it
on<00:00:24.990> once<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.410> dries<00:00:25.619> down<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:26.070> gets<00:00:26.250> tacky<00:00:26.550> and

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
on once it dries down it gets tacky and

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.779 
on once it dries down it gets tacky and
so<00:00:27.449> glitter<00:00:27.689> adheres<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.410> OS<00:00:28.680> for<00:00:29.220> hours

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
so glitter adheres to it OS for hours

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.450 
so glitter adheres to it OS for hours

right there but you can use tons of
different<00:02:13.880> things<00:02:14.090> you<00:02:14.690> can<00:02:15.170> even<00:02:15.410> make<00:02:15.590> your

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
blistering and water I'm sure someone

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.560 
blistering and water I'm sure someone
