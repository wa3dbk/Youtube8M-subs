00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.210
 we must always have a certain type 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.460
 of attitude on that we have 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.080
 worked and on that we must continue 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.210
 we have great respect for ours 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.799
 opponents because novara is a team of 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.770
 quality started in this league 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.750
 to make a championship for sure 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.760
 different is a team that two years ago 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.740
 it was in series we must not forget it 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.230
 than last year with this coach 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.960
 did a great round of return e 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.670
 that had started this year for certain 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.369
 goals then a good coach 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.760
 prepared who has important players e 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.260
 of quality and experience in all 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.960
 departments and therefore we will necessarily have to 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.700
 then do the championship maybe he said 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.040
 other things along the way because sometimes 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.730
 certain leagues are channeled into one 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.120
 a certain way 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.309
 but surely we will have to go down in 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.739
 field however that attitude with 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.899
 the spirit game organization that 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.809
 that allowed us to get this far 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.600
 so we will go as usual to do the 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.649
 maximum we can always know 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.439
 curious to see on the field 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.489
 the attitude of the team that has 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:07.619
 in facing all the matches a 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.820
 regardless of who they are at home or 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.170
 outside the home 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.729
 then in the end what he will tell us 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.920
 match also because then in football the 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.320
 game there are episodes going 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.390
 lived and must be respected 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.159
 in this sense we should go there 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.500
 then play if in the end anyway 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.049
 true the positive result will be fine 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.810
 same because in short it will mean having 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.270
 arithmetically achieved with a 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:36.650
 goal certainly on the eve of 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:39.299
 championship perhaps as a possibility 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.060
 desirable but not at all easy 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.140
 because it has never been for anyone and it is 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.540
 get there later 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.350
 so a few days from the end in 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.509
 this way after leaving with 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.430
 of the changes in the things we know 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.830
 therefore in our history it is a reason 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.119
 of satisfaction but we still remain 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.679
 concentrated 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.320
 we do not change this does not mean 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:02.970
 obviously that maybe then in the series a 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.890
 we obviously do n't know that 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.649
 we will go to tackle teams perhaps of a 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.940
 certain thickness of a certain quality 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.679
 so maybe there may be a 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.600
 depending on the situations of the 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.680
 tricks no as it is normal that it is a 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.620
 depending on the team we're going to 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.690
 face because here too in this 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.220
 so the championship has happened this way 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.920
 does not mean that it must fail 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.500
 the game organization the mentality or 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.510
 the attitude with which the principles 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.760
 with which you go into the field if trouble 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.769
 this is precisely in this sense that you have 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.450
 said well we worked for 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.500
 build this and this was the 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:40.950
 truth the true strength 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:45.620
 having changed accepted has changed 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:48.239
 believing and fortunately we say 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.160
 I think luck is unfortunate then what 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.690
 will then have a game in the long run 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.150
 job that can't come out then 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.040
 believing that that could be the 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.380
 high road to follow the boys today 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.400
 they are convinced and this is the most important thing 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.400
 beautiful is the most important thing
