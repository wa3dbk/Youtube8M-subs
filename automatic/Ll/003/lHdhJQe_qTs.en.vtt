it's<00:00:42.719> really<00:00:42.989> hard<00:00:43.199> to<00:00:43.560> get<00:00:44.100> an<00:00:44.220> idea<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.730> how

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
it's really hard to get an idea of how

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.030 
it's really hard to get an idea of how
much<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.660> should<00:00:45.840> be<00:00:45.960> spending<00:00:46.140> on<00:00:46.530> each<00:00:46.920> of

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
much you should be spending on each of

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.910 
much you should be spending on each of
those<00:00:47.100> different<00:00:47.310> pieces<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.700> equipment<00:00:47.790> so

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
those different pieces of equipment so

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.340 
those different pieces of equipment so
first<00:00:49.920> thing<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.880> camera<00:00:51.060> of<00:00:51.329> course<00:00:51.600> now

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
first thing is the camera of course now

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.319 
first thing is the camera of course now
you<00:00:53.280> could<00:00:53.460> spend<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.790> thousand<00:00:54.090> dollars<00:00:54.120> on

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
you could spend a thousand dollars on

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.229 
you could spend a thousand dollars on
the<00:00:54.750> camera<00:00:54.989> very<00:00:55.350> easily<00:00:55.620> but<00:00:56.399> then<00:00:56.880> you

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
the camera very easily but then you

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.760 
the camera very easily but then you
wouldn't<00:00:57.420> have<00:00:57.510> any<00:00:57.720> microphones<00:00:58.350> you

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
wouldn't have any microphones you

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.290 
wouldn't have any microphones you
wouldn't<00:00:58.950> have<00:00:59.040> any<00:00:59.280> other<00:00:59.550> things<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.000> use<00:01:00.149> it

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
wouldn't have any other things to use it

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.910 
wouldn't have any other things to use it
with<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.540> just<00:01:00.570> have<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.020> camera<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:01.890> I

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
with you just have the camera so I

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.039 
with you just have the camera so I
recommend<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:03.030> spend<00:01:03.300> six<00:01:03.750> hundred

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
recommend that you spend six hundred

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.630 
recommend that you spend six hundred
dollars<00:01:04.290> on<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.469> camera<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.489> get

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
dollars on the camera and you get

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.740 
dollars on the camera and you get
yourself<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:06.149> canon<00:01:06.750> 600d<00:01:07.460> now<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.390> camera

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
yourself a canon 600d now this is camera

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.090 
yourself a canon 600d now this is camera
that<00:01:09.840> I'm<00:01:09.899> using<00:01:10.049> right<00:01:10.170> now<00:01:10.290> I've<00:01:10.680> had<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:10.920> for

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
that I'm using right now I've had it for

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.240 
that I'm using right now I've had it for
a<00:01:11.159> year<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.810> it's<00:01:12.810> basically<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.469> what<00:01:14.219> I

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
a year and it's basically that what I

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.120 
a year and it's basically that what I
think<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.579> be<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.759> best<00:01:15.240> value<00:01:16.130> low-cost

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
think to be the best value low-cost

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.399 
think to be the best value low-cost
camera<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.509> could<00:01:18.780> spend<00:01:18.990> twice<00:01:19.200> as<00:01:19.259> much

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
camera so you could spend twice as much

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.949 
camera so you could spend twice as much
on<00:01:19.829> a<00:01:20.189> DSLR<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.270> probably<00:01:21.539> wouldn't<00:01:21.840> be

00:01:21.949 --> 00:01:21.959 
on a DSLR and it probably wouldn't be

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:24.230 
on a DSLR and it probably wouldn't be
much<00:01:22.170> better<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:22.979> this<00:01:23.130> one<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.520> just<00:01:23.670> it's

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
much better so this one is just it's

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.870 
much better so this one is just it's
really<00:01:24.450> cheap<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.889> it's<00:01:25.889> puts<00:01:26.429> out<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.579> really

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
really cheap and it's puts out a really

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.910 
really cheap and it's puts out a really
good<00:01:27.060> image<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.869> really<00:01:28.109> good<00:01:28.560> value

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
good image it's a really good value

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.059 
good image it's a really good value
camera<00:01:29.429> so<00:01:30.359> that's<00:01:31.109> where<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.289> can<00:01:31.380> start<00:01:31.560> and

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:32.069 
camera so that's where you can start and

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:33.529 
camera so that's where you can start and
you<00:01:32.520> know<00:01:32.639> get<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.819> kit<00:01:32.999> lens<00:01:33.179> for<00:01:33.420> now

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
you know get the kit lens for now

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:35.590 
you know get the kit lens for now
because<00:01:33.899> you're<00:01:34.319> just<00:01:34.499> getting<00:01:34.679> started<00:01:35.069> and

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
because you're just getting started and

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.940 
because you're just getting started and
but<00:01:36.600> there's<00:01:36.779> plenty<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:37.079> room<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.409> upgrade<00:01:37.709> if

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
but there's plenty of room to upgrade if

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.949 
but there's plenty of room to upgrade if
you<00:01:38.100> want<00:01:38.219> to<00:01:38.310> spend<00:01:38.609> more<00:01:39.240> money<00:01:39.420> on<00:01:39.569> lenses

00:01:39.949 --> 00:01:39.959 
you want to spend more money on lenses

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:43.249 
you want to spend more money on lenses
later<00:01:40.380> now<00:01:41.249> you'll<00:01:41.490> need<00:01:41.609> some<00:01:41.880> SD<00:01:42.299> cards<00:01:42.599> to

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
later now you'll need some SD cards to

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.609 
later now you'll need some SD cards to
film<00:01:43.469> with<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:44.249> I<00:01:44.279> recommend<00:01:44.849> the<00:01:45.299> SanDisk<00:01:45.869> 16

audio<00:02:33.799> is<00:02:34.129> something<00:02:34.609> which<00:02:34.760> a<00:02:35.030> lot<00:02:35.390> of

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
audio is something which a lot of

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.459 
audio is something which a lot of
beginner<00:02:36.200> filmmakers<00:02:36.829> will<00:02:37.519> neglect<00:02:38.420> so<00:02:39.079> I'm

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:39.469 
beginner filmmakers will neglect so I'm

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:40.720 
beginner filmmakers will neglect so I'm
going<00:02:39.680> to<00:02:39.709> say<00:02:39.980> right<00:02:40.129> now<00:02:40.189> that<00:02:40.340> you<00:02:40.549> should

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
going to say right now that you should

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.240 
going to say right now that you should
spend<00:02:41.209> a<00:02:41.450> lot<00:02:41.900> more<00:02:41.930> in<00:02:42.230> audio<00:02:42.500> than<00:02:43.040> perhaps

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
spend a lot more in audio than perhaps

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.880 
spend a lot more in audio than perhaps
you<00:02:43.489> might<00:02:43.579> think<00:02:43.849> so<00:02:44.689> audio<00:02:45.349> is<00:02:45.560> actually

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
you might think so audio is actually

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.330 
you might think so audio is actually
half<00:02:46.099> of<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:47.260> video<00:02:48.260> now<00:02:48.890> this<00:02:49.099> is<00:02:49.220> something

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
half of the video now this is something

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.619 
half of the video now this is something
that<00:02:49.430> phrase<00:02:49.849> it<00:02:50.000> gets<00:02:50.120> thrown<00:02:50.269> around<00:02:50.420> a<00:02:50.599> lot

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
that phrase it gets thrown around a lot

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.149 
that phrase it gets thrown around a lot
the<00:02:51.079> idea<00:02:51.109> that<00:02:51.560> if<00:02:51.709> you're<00:02:51.769> going<00:02:51.889> to<00:02:51.980> spend

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:52.159 
the idea that if you're going to spend

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:53.979 
the idea that if you're going to spend
six<00:02:52.849> hundred<00:02:53.090> pounds<00:02:53.299> on<00:02:53.389> your<00:02:53.510> camera<00:02:53.810> you

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
six hundred pounds on your camera you

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.360 
six hundred pounds on your camera you
should<00:02:54.319> probably<00:02:54.469> spend<00:02:54.680> six<00:02:54.950> hundred<00:02:55.159> pounds

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
should probably spend six hundred pounds

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.460 
should probably spend six hundred pounds
on<00:02:55.459> your<00:02:55.519> audio<00:02:55.790> now<00:02:56.480> I<00:02:56.510> don't<00:02:56.689> quite<00:02:57.049> use<00:02:57.260> this

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
on your audio now I don't quite use this

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.860 
on your audio now I don't quite use this
ratio<00:02:57.680> but<00:02:58.459> the<00:02:58.639> idea<00:02:58.909> is<00:02:58.970> there<00:02:59.150> that<00:02:59.750> you

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
ratio but the idea is there that you

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.420 
ratio but the idea is there that you
shouldn't<00:03:00.170> skimp<00:03:00.530> on<00:03:00.739> your<00:03:00.799> audio<00:03:01.159> because

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
shouldn't skimp on your audio because

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.949 
shouldn't skimp on your audio because
people<00:03:01.730> will<00:03:01.849> notice<00:03:02.150> people<00:03:02.689> are<00:03:02.780> more

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
people will notice people are more

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.409 
people will notice people are more
likely<00:03:03.169> to<00:03:03.349> notice<00:03:03.709> bad<00:03:04.099> audio<00:03:04.730> quality<00:03:04.909> than

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:05.419 
likely to notice bad audio quality than

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:07.750 
likely to notice bad audio quality than
they<00:03:05.540> are<00:03:05.569> to<00:03:05.840> notice<00:03:06.319> bad<00:03:06.500> video<00:03:06.980> quality<00:03:07.040> so

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
they are to notice bad video quality so

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.159 
they are to notice bad video quality so
you<00:03:07.819> should<00:03:07.970> really<00:03:08.150> make<00:03:08.299> sure<00:03:08.480> that<00:03:08.900> you<00:03:09.019> are

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:09.169 
you should really make sure that you are

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:11.979 
you should really make sure that you are
investing<00:03:09.680> into<00:03:10.340> good<00:03:10.549> audio<00:03:11.090> equipment<00:03:11.450> so

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
investing into good audio equipment so

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.720 
investing into good audio equipment so
for<00:03:12.200> this<00:03:12.290> the<00:03:12.709> basis<00:03:13.010> of<00:03:13.069> it<00:03:13.189> is<00:03:13.280> a<00:03:13.310> zoom<00:03:13.549> h1

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
for this the basis of it is a zoom h1

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.059 
for this the basis of it is a zoom h1
again<00:03:14.569> I'm<00:03:14.750> using<00:03:14.810> that<00:03:15.049> right<00:03:15.200> now<00:03:15.349> it's<00:03:15.919> an

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
again I'm using that right now it's an

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:17.860 
again I'm using that right now it's an
audio<00:03:16.280> recorder<00:03:16.669> which<00:03:16.790> has<00:03:16.909> a<00:03:16.939> SD<00:03:17.389> card<00:03:17.419> slot

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
audio recorder which has a SD card slot

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.089 
audio recorder which has a SD card slot
so<00:03:18.290> you<00:03:18.349> can<00:03:18.650> record<00:03:19.099> the<00:03:19.310> sound<00:03:19.609> as<00:03:19.819> an<00:03:20.120> mp3<00:03:20.359> or

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
so you can record the sound as an mp3 or

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.190 
so you can record the sound as an mp3 or
wav<00:03:22.099> file<00:03:22.370> and<00:03:22.609> then<00:03:23.239> plug<00:03:23.659> into<00:03:23.810> that<00:03:24.019> you'll

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
wav file and then plug into that you'll

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.339 
wav file and then plug into that you'll
use<00:03:24.439> put<00:03:25.099> them<00:03:25.250> rode<00:03:25.579> videomic<00:03:26.109> this<00:03:27.109> way<00:03:27.290> you

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.349 
use put them rode videomic this way you

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:29.110 
use put them rode videomic this way you
have<00:03:27.560> a<00:03:27.590> really<00:03:27.859> good<00:03:27.980> set<00:03:28.189> up<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:28.790> setup<00:03:28.970> I'm

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
have a really good set up the setup I'm

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.879 
have a really good set up the setup I'm
using<00:03:29.389> right<00:03:29.750> now<00:03:29.780> and<00:03:30.169> it's<00:03:30.500> relatively

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:30.889 
using right now and it's relatively

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:32.770 
using right now and it's relatively
cheap<00:03:31.010> and<00:03:31.430> yet<00:03:31.519> it<00:03:31.639> gets<00:03:31.790> you<00:03:31.940> good<00:03:32.569> results

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
cheap and yet it gets you good results

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.319 
cheap and yet it gets you good results
now<00:03:33.709> you'll<00:03:34.040> need<00:03:34.220> a<00:03:34.459> boom<00:03:34.849> Pole

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
now you'll need a boom Pole

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.539 
now you'll need a boom Pole
so<00:03:35.690> there's<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.079> road<00:03:36.260> micro<00:03:37.129> boom<00:03:37.310> pole

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
so there's the road micro boom pole

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:38.800 
so there's the road micro boom pole
which<00:03:37.699> is<00:03:37.849> kind<00:03:38.090> of<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.209> cheapest<00:03:38.540> thing<00:03:38.690> out

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
which is kind of the cheapest thing out

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.080 
which is kind of the cheapest thing out
there<00:03:38.959> um<00:03:39.109> but<00:03:40.010> that's<00:03:40.099> just<00:03:40.340> that's<00:03:40.760> a<00:03:40.909> good

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
there um but that's just that's a good

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.699 
there um but that's just that's a good
solid<00:03:41.239> boom<00:03:41.540> pole<00:03:41.750> which<00:03:42.290> will<00:03:42.440> allow<00:03:42.530> you<00:03:42.590> to

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
solid boom pole which will allow you to

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.069 
solid boom pole which will allow you to
put<00:03:42.919> the<00:03:43.040> microphone<00:03:43.190> on<00:03:43.639> but<00:03:44.569> you<00:03:44.720> will<00:03:44.900> need

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
put the microphone on but you will need

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.740 
put the microphone on but you will need
a<00:03:45.319> grip<00:03:45.979> to<00:03:46.459> put<00:03:46.699> the<00:03:46.879> between<00:03:47.329> the<00:03:47.510> microphone

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
a grip to put the between the microphone

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.750 
a grip to put the between the microphone
and<00:03:48.139> the<00:03:48.530> boom<00:03:48.680> pole<00:03:48.859> and<00:03:49.069> then<00:03:49.519> you'll<00:03:49.639> also

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
and the boom pole and then you'll also

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.479 
and the boom pole and then you'll also
need<00:03:50.060> a<00:03:50.269> wire<00:03:51.019> to<00:03:51.260> connect<00:03:51.530> the<00:03:51.560> microphone<00:03:51.859> to

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
need a wire to connect the microphone to

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.479 
need a wire to connect the microphone to
the<00:03:52.579> zoom<00:03:52.760> h1<00:03:52.909> but<00:03:53.810> that<00:03:53.930> is<00:03:54.079> your<00:03:54.489> really

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
the zoom h1 but that is your really

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.170 
the zoom h1 but that is your really
solid<00:03:55.909> setup<00:03:56.870> for<00:03:57.560> audio<00:03:57.919> and<00:03:58.849> it<00:03:58.970> will<00:03:59.060> allow

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
solid setup for audio and it will allow

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.869

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
that important thing is this getting

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.409 
that important thing is this getting
microphone<00:04:07.430> nice<00:04:07.609> and<00:04:07.819> close<00:04:08.000> and<00:04:08.299> you're

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:08.419 
microphone nice and close and you're

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:10.599 
microphone nice and close and you're
getting<00:04:08.540> far<00:04:08.900> far<00:04:09.169> superior<00:04:09.430> audio<00:04:10.430> quality

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609 
getting far far superior audio quality

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:12.550 
getting far far superior audio quality
to<00:04:11.329> what<00:04:11.479> you'd<00:04:11.629> have<00:04:11.750> if<00:04:11.930> you<00:04:12.019> just<00:04:12.049> use<00:04:12.379> the

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
to what you'd have if you just use the

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.800 
to what you'd have if you just use the
cameras<00:04:12.889> inbuilt<00:04:13.579> microphone<00:04:13.790> so<00:04:14.569> this<00:04:14.689> is

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
cameras inbuilt microphone so this is

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.020 
cameras inbuilt microphone so this is
really<00:04:15.049> important<00:04:15.500> don't<00:04:16.099> skimp<00:04:16.489> on<00:04:16.609> this<00:04:16.820> I

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
really important don't skimp on this I

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.569 
really important don't skimp on this I
can't<00:04:18.019> say<00:04:18.289> enough<00:04:18.470> how<00:04:19.039> important<00:04:19.400> that<00:04:19.430> is

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
can't say enough how important that is

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.729 
can't say enough how important that is
okay<00:04:20.329> so<00:04:20.389> in<00:04:20.630> terms<00:04:20.659> of<00:04:20.900> batteries<00:04:21.259> the

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
okay so in terms of batteries the

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.710 
okay so in terms of batteries the
battery<00:04:22.070> that<00:04:22.220> comes<00:04:22.340> with<00:04:22.580> the<00:04:22.699> 600d<00:04:23.300> will

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
battery that comes with the 600d will

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.749 
battery that comes with the 600d will
only<00:04:23.840> last<00:04:24.110> about<00:04:24.289> an<00:04:24.470> hour<00:04:24.590> so<00:04:25.130> I<00:04:25.159> recommend

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:25.759 
only last about an hour so I recommend

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:27.279 
only last about an hour so I recommend
you<00:04:25.820> get<00:04:25.909> at<00:04:26.060> least<00:04:26.210> one<00:04:26.479> extra<00:04:26.780> so<00:04:27.080> that<00:04:27.110> you

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
you get at least one extra so that you

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:29.560 
you get at least one extra so that you
can<00:04:27.500> use<00:04:28.130> the<00:04:28.250> camera<00:04:28.400> for<00:04:28.639> longer<00:04:28.849> now<00:04:29.030> if

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
can use the camera for longer now if

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:30.909 
can use the camera for longer now if
you're<00:04:29.750> in<00:04:29.840> America<00:04:29.930> that's<00:04:30.710> where<00:04:30.889> I

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
you're in America that's where I

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.640 
you're in America that's where I
recommend<00:04:31.370> the<00:04:31.550> photic<00:04:32.000> battery<00:04:32.690> and<00:04:32.900> this<00:04:33.529> is

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
recommend the photic battery and this is

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:34.870 
recommend the photic battery and this is
a<00:04:33.680> third<00:04:33.889> party<00:04:33.919> battery<00:04:34.520> it's<00:04:34.639> not<00:04:34.789> as

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
a third party battery it's not as

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.779 
a third party battery it's not as
expensive<00:04:35.060> as<00:04:35.560> the<00:04:36.560> original<00:04:37.039> battery<00:04:37.190> but

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:37.789 
expensive as the original battery but

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:38.110 
expensive as the original battery but
it's

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
it's

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.969 
it's
almost<00:04:38.330> as<00:04:38.449> good<00:04:38.510> and<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:39.560> important<00:04:39.860> thing

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
almost as good and the important thing

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:41.409 
almost as good and the important thing
is<00:04:40.070> it's<00:04:40.220> a<00:04:40.280> lot<00:04:40.370> cheaper<00:04:40.430> and<00:04:40.820> then<00:04:41.210> if<00:04:41.330> you're

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
is it's a lot cheaper and then if you're

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.870 
is it's a lot cheaper and then if you're
in<00:04:41.510> England<00:04:41.570> you<00:04:42.260> can<00:04:42.290> get<00:04:42.620> the<00:04:42.740> maximum<00:04:43.280> Oh

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
in England you can get the maximum Oh

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.930 
in England you can get the maximum Oh
battery<00:04:44.510> which<00:04:45.139> is<00:04:45.169> similar<00:04:46.130> just<00:04:46.400> the<00:04:46.669> kind

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
handheld shots they're a lot more stable

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.890 
handheld shots they're a lot more stable
and<00:06:04.240> then<00:06:05.240> the<00:06:05.389> other<00:06:05.510> thing<00:06:05.690> I'd<00:06:05.810> recommend

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
and then the other thing I'd recommend

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.060 
and then the other thing I'd recommend
is<00:06:06.410> a<00:06:06.860> five<00:06:07.760> in<00:06:07.940> one<00:06:08.060> reflector<00:06:08.710> I'm<00:06:09.710> using<00:06:09.889> one

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
is a five in one reflector I'm using one

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.219

right<00:06:10.220> now<00:06:10.340> and<00:06:10.550> they<00:06:11.210> basically<00:06:11.419> just<00:06:11.690> really

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:12.229 
right now and they basically just really

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:15.040 
right now and they basically just really
good<00:06:12.410> for<00:06:12.560> bouncing<00:06:12.889> light<00:06:13.180> because<00:06:14.180> they

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
good for bouncing light because they

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.860 
good for bouncing light because they
they're<00:06:15.620> really<00:06:15.860> cheap<00:06:16.039> and<00:06:16.389> they<00:06:17.389> basically

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.870

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:21.199 
mirror which will you can use to bounce

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:22.870 
mirror which will you can use to bounce
light<00:06:21.500> from<00:06:21.650> windows<00:06:21.830> or<00:06:22.520> other<00:06:22.550> light

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 
light from windows or other light

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.060 
light from windows or other light
sources<00:06:23.180> to<00:06:23.300> improve<00:06:23.690> your<00:06:23.840> lighting<00:06:24.139> and

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:25.070

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 
they can actually have a really big

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.150 
they can actually have a really big
effect<00:06:26.180> on<00:06:26.449> the<00:06:26.570> video<00:06:26.780> ok<00:06:27.500> so<00:06:27.560> that's<00:06:27.830> my<00:06:27.919> one

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 
effect on the video ok so that's my one

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.070 
effect on the video ok so that's my one
thousand<00:06:28.490> dollar<00:06:28.639> filmmaking<00:06:29.000> kit<00:06:29.270> so<00:06:29.960> that

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 
thousand dollar filmmaking kit so that

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.620 
thousand dollar filmmaking kit so that
is<00:06:30.289> what<00:06:30.440> I<00:06:30.470> think<00:06:30.590> to<00:06:30.860> be<00:06:31.010> the<00:06:31.910> best<00:06:32.120> beginners

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630 
is what I think to be the best beginners

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.529 
is what I think to be the best beginners
set<00:06:33.410> of<00:06:33.590> equipment<00:06:34.039> so<00:06:34.520> if<00:06:34.849> you've<00:06:35.120> know<00:06:35.389> if

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:35.539 
set of equipment so if you've know if

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:37.029 
set of equipment so if you've know if
you<00:06:35.630> haven't<00:06:35.840> got<00:06:35.960> any<00:06:36.050> equipment<00:06:36.289> and<00:06:36.620> you

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.039 
you haven't got any equipment and you

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:38.469 
you haven't got any equipment and you
would<00:06:37.130> order<00:06:37.460> all<00:06:37.550> that<00:06:37.699> stuff<00:06:38.000> I<00:06:38.150> think<00:06:38.240> that

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479 
would order all that stuff I think that

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:40.360 
would order all that stuff I think that
would<00:06:38.570> be<00:06:38.599> a<00:06:38.720> really<00:06:39.020> good<00:06:39.289> foundation<00:06:39.770> in

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.370 
would be a really good foundation in

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.029 
would be a really good foundation in
terms<00:06:40.760> of<00:06:40.910> equipment<00:06:41.180> and<00:06:42.169> you<00:06:42.620> know<00:06:42.740> it's<00:06:42.919> not

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:43.039 
terms of equipment and you know it's not

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:44.980 
terms of equipment and you know it's not
too<00:06:43.250> expensive<00:06:43.550> there's<00:06:44.479> a<00:06:44.539> fair<00:06:44.720> amount<00:06:44.810> of

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:44.990 
too expensive there's a fair amount of
