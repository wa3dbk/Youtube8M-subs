00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.000 

here's<00:00:09.809> our<00:00:09.990> stock<00:00:10.260> that<00:00:10.469> we've<00:00:10.650> milled<00:00:10.860> out

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
here's our stock that we've milled out

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.129 
here's our stock that we've milled out
so<00:00:11.280> far<00:00:11.519> well<00:00:12.150> now<00:00:12.330> we<00:00:12.389> have<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.750> do<00:00:12.840> something

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
so far well now we have to do something

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.570 
so far well now we have to do something
with<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.500> ants<00:00:13.860> we're<00:00:14.070> going<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.280> have<00:00:14.400> to

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
with the ants we're going to have to

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.630 
with the ants we're going to have to
make<00:00:14.730> these<00:00:14.880> ends<00:00:15.269> Square<00:00:15.980> to<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.130> faces<00:00:17.609> in

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
make these ends Square to the faces in

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.550 
make these ends Square to the faces in
the<00:00:17.880> edges<00:00:18.240> so<00:00:18.690> we're<00:00:18.840> going<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.080> come<00:00:19.230> back<00:00:19.260> to

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
the edges so we're going to come back to

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.410 
the edges so we're going to come back to
the<00:00:19.680> table<00:00:20.070> saw<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.550> we're<00:00:21.000> going<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.270> use

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
the table saw and we're going to use

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.859 
the table saw and we're going to use
another<00:00:21.769> item<00:00:22.970> called<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.090> miter<00:00:24.300> gauge<00:00:24.630> to

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
another item called the miter gauge to

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.640 
another item called the miter gauge to
make<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.050> crosscut<00:00:26.480> to<00:00:27.480> check<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:28.109> miter

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
make a crosscut to check that that miter

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.830 
make a crosscut to check that that miter
gauge<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.189> at<00:00:29.369> right<00:00:29.580> angles<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.240> blade<00:00:30.599> I

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
gauge is at right angles to the blade I

fastest way to do it is to take a test
piece<00:00:38.090> just<00:00:39.090> an<00:00:39.210> old<00:00:39.390> hunk<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.719> pine<00:00:39.930> like<00:00:40.170> this

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
piece just an old hunk of pine like this

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.979 
piece just an old hunk of pine like this
and<00:00:40.620> cut<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.399> half<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.940> see<00:00:42.510> if<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.780> two

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
and cut it in half and see if the two

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.680 
and cut it in half and see if the two
face<00:00:43.290> at<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.680> two<00:00:43.860> edges<00:00:44.040> match<00:00:44.450> so<00:00:45.450> I'm<00:00:45.570> going

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
face at the two edges match so I'm going

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.260

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.970 

alright<00:01:29.510> here's<00:01:30.510> my<00:01:30.600> one<00:01:30.930> marked<00:01:31.260> edge<00:01:31.440> I'm

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 
alright here's my one marked edge I'm

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.890

going<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.310> set<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.730> on<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.090> machine<00:01:33.210> surface

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
going to set that on the machine surface

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.240 
going to set that on the machine surface
of<00:01:34.080> that<00:01:34.170> table<00:01:34.950> saw<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.370> is<00:01:37.100> machined<00:01:38.100> at

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
of that table saw that is machined at

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.520 
of that table saw that is machined at
the<00:01:38.400> factory<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.360> perfectly<00:01:39.840> level<00:01:40.200> I'm

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
the factory so it is perfectly level I'm

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.490 
the factory so it is perfectly level I'm
going<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.370> take<00:01:41.580> my<00:01:41.760> other<00:01:41.940> scrap<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.690> this

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
going to take my other scrap and this

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.440 
going to take my other scrap and this
time<00:01:43.800> I'm<00:01:44.040> going<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.580> put<00:01:44.760> this<00:01:44.940> marked<00:01:45.300> edge

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
time I'm going to put this marked edge

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.350 
time I'm going to put this marked edge
up<00:01:46.250> I'm<00:01:47.250> going<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.550> push<00:01:47.730> the<00:01:47.910> two<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.240> these

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
up I'm going to push the two of these

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.980 
up I'm going to push the two of these
together<00:01:49.310> and<00:01:52.430> if<00:01:53.430> that's<00:01:53.820> miter<00:01:54.420> gauge<00:01:54.720> was

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
together and if that's miter gauge was

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.410 
together and if that's miter gauge was
at<00:01:55.170> 90<00:01:55.530> degrees<00:01:55.890> these<00:01:56.850> would<00:01:57.210> match

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
at 90 degrees these would match

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.230 
at 90 degrees these would match
perfectly<00:01:57.860> they<00:01:58.860> don't<00:01:59.130> so<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.640> need<00:01:59.970> to<00:02:00.090> go

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
perfectly they don't so I need to go

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.450 
perfectly they don't so I need to go
back<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.810> adjust<00:02:00.930> my<00:02:01.320> miter<00:02:01.590> gauge<00:02:01.890> to

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
back and adjust my miter gauge to

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.109 
back and adjust my miter gauge to
correct<00:02:02.850> for<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.120> cut<00:02:07.700> so<00:02:08.700> I'll<00:02:08.820> put<00:02:09.030> the

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
correct for that cut so I'll put the

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.420 
correct for that cut so I'll put the
miter<00:02:09.330> gauge<00:02:09.450> in<00:02:09.960> and<00:02:10.170> there's<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.560> whole<00:02:11.040> lot

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
miter gauge in and there's a whole lot

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.280 
miter gauge in and there's a whole lot
of<00:02:11.460> different<00:02:12.000> kinds<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.390> miter<00:02:12.630> gauges<00:02:13.170> out

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
of different kinds of miter gauges out

on the market ones that you can adjust

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.590 
on the market ones that you can adjust
in<00:02:16.200> different<00:02:16.590> ways<00:02:16.770> there's<00:02:17.430> elaborate<00:02:18.390> ones

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
in different ways there's elaborate ones

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.490 
in different ways there's elaborate ones
like<00:02:18.840> these<00:02:19.080> there's<00:02:19.380> a<00:02:19.470> little<00:02:19.680> bit<00:02:19.830> more

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
like these there's a little bit more

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.430 
like these there's a little bit more
simple<00:02:22.500> ones<00:02:22.830> like<00:02:23.100> this<00:02:23.840> that<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:25.020> can<00:02:25.050> use

but<00:02:26.010> they<00:02:26.160> all<00:02:26.310> have<00:02:26.520> some<00:02:26.760> sort<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.090> mechanism

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
but they all have some sort of mechanism

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.949 
but they all have some sort of mechanism
for<00:02:28.200> adjusting<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:28.770> cut<00:02:29.070> and<00:02:29.670> what<00:02:30.660> I'm<00:02:30.780> going

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
for adjusting the cut and what I'm going

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.480 
for adjusting the cut and what I'm going
to<00:02:30.990> do<00:02:31.140> with<00:02:31.290> this<00:02:31.440> one<00:02:31.650> is<00:02:31.680> loosen<00:02:32.190> up<00:02:32.310> the

to do with this one is loosen up the

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.270 
to do with this one is loosen up the
lock<00:02:32.700> knobs<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.180> little<00:02:33.450> bit<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:35.670> move<00:02:36.660> this<00:02:36.900> a

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
lock knobs a little bit and move this a

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.070 
lock knobs a little bit and move this a
little<00:02:38.280> bit<00:02:38.580> in<00:02:38.730> this<00:02:38.850> direction<00:02:39.080> retighten

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
little bit in this direction retighten

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:47.120 
little bit in this direction retighten
the<00:02:40.170> lock<00:02:40.380> knobs<00:02:44.390> and<00:02:45.390> now<00:02:45.600> that<00:02:45.780> I've<00:02:45.930> got<00:02:46.140> I'm

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
the lock knobs and now that I've got I'm

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.610 
the lock knobs and now that I've got I'm
kind<00:02:47.610> of<00:02:47.700> attempting<00:02:48.390> to<00:02:48.480> bracket<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.230> 90

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
kind of attempting to bracket the 90

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.440 
kind of attempting to bracket the 90

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
degree cut so I'm going to put this back

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.100 
degree cut so I'm going to put this back
in<00:02:51.950> start<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.100> saw

and just like I did before with the

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.130 
and just like I did before with the
jointed<00:03:01.010> edges<00:03:01.490> I'm<00:03:01.820> going<00:03:02.450> to<00:03:02.540> hold<00:03:02.720> this<00:03:02.840> end

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
jointed edges I'm going to hold this end

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.260 
jointed edges I'm going to hold this end
up<00:03:03.290> towards<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.740> light<00:03:03.920> and<00:03:04.220> see<00:03:04.970> where<00:03:05.120> my

up towards the light and see where my

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.470 
up towards the light and see where my
cut<00:03:05.510> is<00:03:05.720> and<00:03:06.040> it<00:03:07.040> looks<00:03:07.070> like<00:03:07.430> well<00:03:08.030> I<00:03:08.210> was

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
cut is and it looks like well I was

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.400

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
it only took me one adjustment to get it

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.500
