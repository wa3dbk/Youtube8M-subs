00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
one of the last thing I'm talking about

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.199 
one of the last thing I'm talking about
when<00:03:16.829> in<00:03:16.920> fact<00:03:16.950> it's<00:03:17.310> actually<00:03:17.400> probably<00:03:17.819> the

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
when in fact it's actually probably the

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.430 
when in fact it's actually probably the
most<00:03:18.359> important<00:03:18.780> thing<00:03:18.870> there<00:03:18.959> is<00:03:19.019> and<00:03:19.350> the

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.509 
most important thing there is and the
biggest<00:03:19.620> change<00:03:19.769> in<00:03:19.950> my<00:03:20.040> opinion<00:03:20.280> that<00:03:20.370> they

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
biggest change in my opinion that they

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.190 
biggest change in my opinion that they
made<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:20.700> gameplay<00:03:21.120> was<00:03:21.299> offsides<00:03:21.840> they're

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
made the gameplay was offsides they're

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.449 
made the gameplay was offsides they're
completely<00:03:22.530> fixed<00:03:22.769> up<00:03:22.889> size<00:03:23.040> is<00:03:23.220> really

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
completely fixed up size is really

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.910 
completely fixed up size is really
realistic<00:03:23.670> now<00:03:24.030> um<00:03:24.269> basically<00:03:24.660> plays<00:03:25.230> on<00:03:25.650> my

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
realistic now um basically plays on my

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.500 
realistic now um basically plays on my
fifa<00:03:26.130> 12<00:03:26.310> players<00:03:26.579> will<00:03:26.760> just<00:03:27.000> stand<00:03:27.239> outside

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
science but it's a lot more realistic

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.800 
science but it's a lot more realistic
and<00:03:38.670> it's<00:03:38.760> a<00:03:38.819> lot<00:03:38.940> harder<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.359> be<00:03:39.510> offside

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
and it's a lot harder to be offside

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.300 
and it's a lot harder to be offside
definitely<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.260> most<00:03:40.349> advertised<00:03:40.920> change<00:03:41.190> to

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
definitely the most advertised change to

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.830 
definitely the most advertised change to
the<00:03:41.400> gameplay<00:03:41.579> would<00:03:41.849> have<00:03:41.940> been<00:03:42.090> first<00:03:42.510> touch

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
the gameplay would have been first touch

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.569 
the gameplay would have been first touch
which<00:03:43.109> is<00:03:43.230> a<00:03:43.260> bit<00:03:43.440> mixed<00:03:43.680> first<00:03:44.220> touch<00:03:44.400> can

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
which is a bit mixed first touch can

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.120 
which is a bit mixed first touch can
seem<00:03:44.730> completely<00:03:45.239> random<00:03:45.720> like<00:03:45.900> um<00:03:46.139> I'll<00:03:46.769> show

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
seem completely random like um I'll show

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.430 
seem completely random like um I'll show
here<00:03:47.340> a<00:03:47.370> few<00:03:47.579> clips<00:03:47.819> of<00:03:48.000> just<00:03:48.239> like<00:03:48.450> a<00:03:48.480> simple

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
here a few clips of just like a simple

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.170 
here a few clips of just like a simple
pass<00:03:49.620> is<00:03:49.829> going<00:03:50.099> good<00:03:50.340> players<00:03:50.609> and<00:03:50.730> them<00:03:50.970> just

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
pass is going good players and them just

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.000 
pass is going good players and them just
cocking<00:03:51.810> up<00:03:51.989> basically<00:03:52.380> like<00:03:52.590> that<00:03:52.769> stuff

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
cocking up basically like that stuff

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.710 
cocking up basically like that stuff
doesn't<00:03:53.310> happen<00:03:53.400> in<00:03:53.609> real<00:03:53.639> life<00:03:53.790> I<00:03:54.120> understand

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
doesn't happen in real life I understand

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.120 
doesn't happen in real life I understand
the<00:03:54.810> players<00:03:55.019> don't<00:03:55.440> always<00:03:55.620> have<00:03:55.739> a<00:03:55.799> perfect

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
the players don't always have a perfect

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.409 
the players don't always have a perfect
first<00:03:56.310> arch<00:03:56.489> but<00:03:56.669> when<00:03:56.760> you're<00:03:56.880> passing<00:03:57.090> to

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
first arch but when you're passing to

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.210 
first arch but when you're passing to
jawan<00:03:57.840> matter<00:03:58.109> from<00:03:58.380> a<00:03:58.500> yard<00:03:58.739> away<00:03:58.829> from<00:03:59.190> a

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
jawan matter from a yard away from a

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.400 
jawan matter from a yard away from a
corner<00:03:59.430> kick<00:03:59.519> he's<00:04:00.180> not<00:04:00.359> gonna<00:04:00.510> miss<00:04:01.019> control

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
corner kick he's not gonna miss control

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.839 
corner kick he's not gonna miss control
it<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:01.680> then<00:04:01.829> like<00:04:01.919> you<00:04:02.099> know<00:04:02.190> go<00:04:02.400> media<00:04:02.669> miles

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
it and then like you know go media miles

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:04.699 
it and then like you know go media miles
away<00:04:03.090> however<00:04:03.660> as<00:04:03.840> random<00:04:04.260> as<00:04:04.319> first<00:04:04.560> touches

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
away however as random as first touches

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.110 
away however as random as first touches
it<00:04:05.010> can<00:04:05.160> actually<00:04:05.430> work<00:04:05.579> to<00:04:05.639> your<00:04:05.730> benefit

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
it can actually work to your benefit

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.879 
it can actually work to your benefit
like<00:04:06.299> sup<00:04:06.540> I've<00:04:06.870> had<00:04:07.049> occasions<00:04:07.470> where<00:04:07.680> I'm

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
like sup I've had occasions where I'm

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:09.559 
like sup I've had occasions where I'm
I'm<00:04:08.040> through<00:04:08.760> bullets<00:04:09.030> in<00:04:09.120> someone<00:04:09.359> and<00:04:09.389> it

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
I'm through bullets in someone and it

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.210 
I'm through bullets in someone and it
first<00:04:09.720> touch<00:04:09.930> has<00:04:10.049> been<00:04:10.200> so<00:04:10.470> bad<00:04:10.889> that<00:04:11.069> it's

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
first touch has been so bad that it's

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.860 
first touch has been so bad that it's
taking<00:04:11.489> it<00:04:11.579> past<00:04:11.849> the<00:04:12.000> goalie<00:04:12.180> by<00:04:12.359> accident

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
taking it past the goalie by accident

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.569 
taking it past the goalie by accident
and<00:04:13.019> then<00:04:13.500> basically<00:04:13.650> just<00:04:13.980> had<00:04:14.099> an<00:04:14.190> open<00:04:14.459> goal

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
and then basically just had an open goal

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.430 
and then basically just had an open goal
that<00:04:14.730> type<00:04:14.849> it<00:04:14.970> into<00:04:15.090> so<00:04:15.389> that's<00:04:16.079> a<00:04:16.200> scenario

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
that type it into so that's a scenario

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.529 
that type it into so that's a scenario
where<00:04:16.650> it<00:04:16.769> could<00:04:16.919> benefit<00:04:17.609> you<00:04:17.789> but<00:04:17.970> um<00:04:18.150> first

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
where it could benefit you but um first

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:19.610 
where it could benefit you but um first
touch<00:04:18.630> will<00:04:18.780> take<00:04:18.930> some<00:04:19.049> getting<00:04:19.079> used<00:04:19.320> to

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
touch will take some getting used to

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.080 
touch will take some getting used to
take<00:04:20.039> some<00:04:20.190> getting<00:04:20.340> used<00:04:20.370> to<00:04:20.579> in<00:04:20.760> terms<00:04:20.970> of

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
take some getting used to in terms of

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.979 
take some getting used to in terms of
online<00:04:21.329> seasons<00:04:21.659> it<00:04:21.750> hasn't<00:04:21.930> actually

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
online seasons it hasn't actually

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.570

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
so yeah I think catalog is one of the

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.500 
so yeah I think catalog is one of the
best<00:04:59.520> things<00:04:59.670> they've<00:04:59.790> ever<00:04:59.940> added<00:05:00.240> one<00:05:00.420> of

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
best things they've ever added one of

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.860 
best things they've ever added one of
the<00:05:00.570> cleverest<00:05:00.690> things<00:05:01.080> they've<00:05:01.260> oh<00:05:01.350> uh<00:05:02.870> ever

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
the cleverest things they've oh uh ever

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.780
