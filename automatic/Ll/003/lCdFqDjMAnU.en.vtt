00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
as I mentioned and I think this is

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.120 
as I mentioned and I think this is
really<00:04:45.390> important<00:04:46.320> and<00:04:46.530> I<00:04:46.620> think<00:04:46.650> it's<00:04:46.890> really

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
really important and I think it's really

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.680

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
1980s rolled around I think it brought a

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.700 
1980s rolled around I think it brought a
lot<00:04:51.270> of<00:04:51.420> attention<00:04:51.960> to<00:04:51.990> the<00:04:52.200> fact<00:04:52.410> that<00:04:52.500> there

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
lot of attention to the fact that there

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.710

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:49.770 
and that is nothing new that's been

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.040 
and that is nothing new that's been
going<00:06:50.039> on<00:06:50.129> for<00:06:50.189> about<00:06:50.490> 20<00:06:50.789> years<00:06:50.819> now<00:06:51.240> and<00:06:51.479> I

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.050 
going on for about 20 years now and I

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.659 
going on for about 20 years now and I
don't<00:06:52.110> bring<00:06:52.469> this<00:06:52.589> up<00:06:52.770> to<00:06:52.889> start<00:06:53.159> that<00:06:53.339> debate

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:53.669 
don't bring this up to start that debate

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:55.519 
don't bring this up to start that debate
but<00:06:53.909> my<00:06:54.059> point<00:06:54.300> is<00:06:54.509> is<00:06:54.569> one<00:06:54.990> of<00:06:55.080> the<00:06:55.139> reasons<00:06:55.409> I

00:06:55.519 --> 00:06:55.529 
but my point is is one of the reasons I

00:06:55.529 --> 00:06:57.709 
but my point is is one of the reasons I
do<00:06:55.589> this<00:06:55.919> show<00:06:56.189> is<00:06:56.759> I<00:06:56.939> think<00:06:56.999> it's<00:06:57.240> extremely

00:06:57.709 --> 00:06:57.719 
do this show is I think it's extremely

00:06:57.719 --> 00:06:59.829 
do this show is I think it's extremely
important<00:06:58.379> to<00:06:58.529> cover<00:06:58.830> these<00:06:59.009> people<00:06:59.430> and

00:06:59.829 --> 00:06:59.839 
important to cover these people and

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:01.820 
important to cover these people and
especially<00:07:00.839> those<00:07:01.020> that<00:07:01.259> are<00:07:01.349> still<00:07:01.619> living

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:01.830 
especially those that are still living

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.799 
especially those that are still living
because<00:07:02.309> we<00:07:02.550> don't<00:07:02.819> know<00:07:02.999> how<00:07:03.180> much<00:07:03.330> time<00:07:03.599> we

00:07:03.799 --> 00:07:03.809 
because we don't know how much time we

00:07:03.809 --> 00:07:05.899 
because we don't know how much time we
have<00:07:04.020> left<00:07:04.050> and<00:07:04.649> sometimes<00:07:05.159> it<00:07:05.309> is<00:07:05.460> too<00:07:05.729> late

00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:05.909 
have left and sometimes it is too late

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:09.589 
have left and sometimes it is too late
and<00:07:06.119> I<00:07:06.569> feel<00:07:06.749> like<00:07:06.899> a<00:07:07.080> little<00:07:07.349> bit<00:07:07.589> may<00:07:08.189> be<00:07:08.599> the

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599 
and I feel like a little bit may be the

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:10.939 
and I feel like a little bit may be the
thing<00:07:09.779> when<00:07:09.990> I<00:07:10.020> brought<00:07:10.289> that<00:07:10.349> up<00:07:10.499> with<00:07:10.740> Mary

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.050 
Ellen was a little bit too late now the

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:14.480
