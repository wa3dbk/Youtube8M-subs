another cool system that I like which is

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.729 
another cool system that I like which is
the<00:03:32.700> center<00:03:32.970> drag<00:03:33.209> it<00:03:33.420> can<00:03:33.540> just<00:03:33.720> reach<00:03:33.930> slide

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
the center drag it can just reach slide

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.380 
the center drag it can just reach slide
my<00:03:34.890> hand<00:03:35.100> right<00:03:35.250> there<00:03:35.310> right<00:03:36.030> on<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.239> center

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
my hand right there right on the center

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.870 
my hand right there right on the center
drag<00:03:36.750> and<00:03:36.989> move<00:03:37.019> but<00:03:37.890> a<00:03:38.100> majority<00:03:38.430> of<00:03:38.790> the

going to your either reverse Drake or
top<00:03:43.319> drag<00:03:43.650> systems<00:03:44.160> and<00:03:44.430> then<00:03:45.120> they<00:03:45.630> also<00:03:45.780> come

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
top drag systems and then they also come

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.199 
top drag systems and then they also come
with<00:03:46.140> multiple<00:03:46.709> spools<00:03:47.040> multiple<00:03:47.730> spools<00:03:48.030> are
