00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.130
 dossier a we are going through the critical phase of bad weather bad weather started 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:12.239
 a few days ago 

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:16.480
 sol nord europa then moved to central europe now interests not 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.909
 only these countries north of the Alps map all the countries in the Mediterranean area 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:26.810
 Italy is among the most affected regions and it will remain kryon - during the 

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:28.340
 next 48 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.180
 episodes not some sense 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.829
 an improvement starting from the day 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:34.999
 27 with ups and downs 

00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:38.029
 then I will go on like this until the whole day I have 29 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.210
 but the band still loses more weather. 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.460
 and that wait not so much tomorrow 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.810
 here the sunny spells will occur 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.610
 at least on the central part on the rivieras of the west on the upper tirreno 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.800
 on Sardinia as much as the deterioration on the south in Italy and partly if the 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.800
 central regions in the day of holy spirit 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.489
 then here is all my immense cloudiness for you and me 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.740
 anita many things but if they are the regions 7 channels locally on the Po valley 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.460
 where the temperatures during the night were below zero we go to see yours 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.020
 minimum values ​​and temperatures 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.140
 the comparison is made with the data 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.250
 in the third decade of December the increases depended on the coverage of the 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.700
 sky and strong sirocco winds 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.700
 some decrease to see as in Cagliari only of 3 degree 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.660
 whereas, on the other hand, waiting for a decrease over the whole of Italy, perhaps even if 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.300
 yesterday 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.740
 during the minimum night temperatures 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.920
 we see the values ​​of the 13 hours 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.470
 also here and there of the dimensions of strong increases the increase of ancona 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.220
 temperature that looks like spring 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.020
 even if it is only an extremely transitory phase in Bolzano 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.790
 instead the temperature decreased considerably 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.790
 it goes on we see the house of time all screen 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.560
 then we're in the Atlantic another perturbation looming that faces the 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.390
 france and from france this disturbance will follow on the same faye 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.960
 takes off 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.660
 in the first of that which is affecting now reggio emilia nostra 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:08.379
 peninsula 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.860
 tomorrow to the central Mediterranean junta 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.300
 eastern europe, however, remains an unstable time waiting for another 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.190
 worsening 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.960
 disturbance that is becoming 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.010
 let's see tomorrow's time that we do in time to give the game of 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.780
 words we will see with the 26 then tomorrow and think some light on the part 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.470
 north-west and I am a high Tyrrhenian for the rest in a strong glass 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.380
 of time for Cuba on the site said on the 5 of Italy essentially from the molin se 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.159
 to the south 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:39.330
 also contemporary strong intensity 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.429
 and wind blows on the 26th 

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:44.769
 here is the worsening that already begins in depth from tomorrow afternoon island 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.939
 sardinia on the whole of italy in particular on the three venezie and then 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:51.780
