00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
this in the direction of the folds in

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.590 
this in the direction of the folds in
the<00:01:53.360> mold<00:01:53.659> and<00:01:54.399> don't<00:01:55.399> forget<00:01:55.670> to<00:01:55.820> butter<00:01:56.030> the

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
the mold and don't forget to butter the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.889 
the mold and don't forget to butter the
tops<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:58.310> tops<00:01:58.579> of<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:58.820> molds<00:01:59.149> you<00:01:59.240> see<00:01:59.450> like

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
tops the tops of the molds you see like

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.120 
tops the tops of the molds you see like
this<00:02:00.079> and<00:02:00.670> then<00:02:01.670> you<00:02:01.759> place<00:02:01.969> them<00:02:02.210> face<00:02:02.450> down

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
this and then you place them face down

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.249 
this and then you place them face down
so<00:02:04.130> that<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:04.399> butter<00:02:04.609> slides<00:02:05.390> toward<00:02:05.899> the<00:02:06.020> top

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
so that the butter slides toward the top

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.270 
so that the butter slides toward the top
edges<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:06.979> not<00:02:07.219> to<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.640> bottom<00:02:09.100> you<00:02:10.100> can<00:02:10.130> see

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
edges and not to the bottom you can see

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.569 
edges and not to the bottom you can see
they're<00:02:11.090> perfect<00:02:11.540> and<00:02:11.750> I<00:02:11.959> put<00:02:12.170> them<00:02:12.290> down<00:02:12.579> onto

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:13.579 
they're perfect and I put them down onto

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:15.400 
they're perfect and I put them down onto
the<00:02:13.700> baking<00:02:13.850> sheet<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:14.750> will<00:02:14.870> go<00:02:15.019> into<00:02:15.260> the

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
the baking sheet that will go into the

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.360 
the baking sheet that will go into the
oven<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:17.390> now<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:18.620> butter<00:02:18.859> and<00:02:19.160> the

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370

oven and now the butter and the
Chocolate<00:02:19.609> have<00:02:19.970> melted<00:02:20.359> now<00:02:21.350> with<00:02:21.980> a<00:02:22.010> whisk

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
Chocolate have melted now with a whisk

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.870 
Chocolate have melted now with a whisk
we're<00:02:22.820> going<00:02:22.970> to<00:02:23.090> mix<00:02:23.269> them<00:02:23.450> together<00:02:24.700> so<00:02:25.700> that

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
we're going to mix them together so that

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.420 
we're going to mix them together so that
the<00:02:25.940> mixture<00:02:26.120> is<00:02:26.510> homogeneous<00:02:27.160> so<00:02:28.160> that<00:02:28.340> the

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
the mixture is homogeneous so that the

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.940 
the mixture is homogeneous so that the
chocolate<00:02:28.910> and<00:02:29.239> the<00:02:29.989> butter<00:02:30.019> are<00:02:30.470> blended

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
chocolate and the butter are blended

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.320 
chocolate and the butter are blended
together
