00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
upfront process which is okay let's go

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.520 
upfront process which is okay let's go
on<00:00:52.700> schedule<00:00:53.180> let's<00:00:53.360> get<00:00:53.540> this<00:00:53.809> because<00:00:54.260> we've

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
on schedule let's get this because we've

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.720 
on schedule let's get this because we've
got<00:00:54.770> to<00:00:54.980> feed<00:00:55.790> this<00:00:56.000> this<00:00:56.719> beast<00:00:57.050> here<00:00:57.730> our

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
got to feed this this beast here our

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.340 
got to feed this this beast here our
issue<00:00:59.120> and<00:00:59.450> I<00:00:59.480> think<00:00:59.510> this<00:00:59.840> is<00:00:59.960> true<00:01:00.110> in<00:01:00.200> most

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
issue and I think this is true in most

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.770 
issue and I think this is true in most
places<00:01:00.590> is<00:01:01.100> the<00:01:01.550> very<00:01:01.850> nature<00:01:02.180> of<00:01:02.390> what<00:01:02.540> we're

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
places is the very nature of what we're

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.990 
places is the very nature of what we're
doing<00:01:03.200> at<00:01:03.350> the<00:01:03.469> front<00:01:03.680> is<00:01:04.000> fundamentally

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
doing at the front is fundamentally

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.969 
doing at the front is fundamentally
different<00:01:05.030> than<00:01:05.449> we're<00:01:05.689> running<00:01:06.649> the<00:01:06.770> Beast

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
different than we're running the Beast

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.429 
different than we're running the Beast
we're<00:01:07.969> doing<00:01:08.240> something<00:01:08.569> which<00:01:08.719> is<00:01:08.869> unknown

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
we're doing something which is unknown

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.770 
we're doing something which is unknown
we're<00:01:09.859> in<00:01:10.069> wild<00:01:10.639> territory<00:01:11.240> we<00:01:11.450> don't<00:01:11.659> know

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
we're in wild territory we don't know

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.590 
we're in wild territory we don't know
what's<00:01:11.959> going<00:01:12.200> to<00:01:12.289> happen<00:01:12.709> and<00:01:13.060> what<00:01:14.060> we<00:01:14.299> first

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
what's going to happen and what we first

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.760 
what's going to happen and what we first
do<00:01:14.990> or<00:01:15.759> if<00:01:16.759> I<00:01:16.850> think<00:01:16.909> of<00:01:17.149> movies<00:01:17.509> if<00:01:18.289> people

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
do or if I think of movies if people

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.249 
do or if I think of movies if people
think<00:01:18.950> making<00:01:19.459> the<00:01:19.700> movie<00:01:19.999> sounds<00:01:20.810> exciting

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
think making the movie sounds exciting

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.169 
think making the movie sounds exciting
and<00:01:21.350> it<00:01:21.799> is<00:01:21.920> exciting<00:01:22.459> but<00:01:22.609> there's<00:01:23.060> an

00:01:23.169 --> 00:01:23.179 
and it is exciting but there's an

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:25.149 
and it is exciting but there's an
imagination<00:01:24.049> of<00:01:24.139> what<00:01:24.289> it<00:01:24.380> must<00:01:24.469> be<00:01:24.619> like<00:01:24.709> it's

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
imagination of what it must be like it's

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.489 
imagination of what it must be like it's
sorta<00:01:25.639> like<00:01:25.670> having<00:01:26.060> this<00:01:26.179> beautiful<00:01:27.020> baby

00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:27.499 
sorta like having this beautiful baby

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:29.019 
sorta like having this beautiful baby

00:01:29.019 --> 00:01:29.029 
and the baby grows up to be this

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:31.809 
and the baby grows up to be this
beautiful<00:01:29.479> movie<00:01:30.020> star<00:01:30.289> but<00:01:31.219> what<00:01:31.429> do<00:01:31.490> you<00:01:31.579> do

00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:31.819 
beautiful movie star but what do you do

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:36.129 
beautiful movie star but what do you do
if<00:01:32.149> the<00:01:32.539> baby<00:01:32.719> is<00:01:33.049> ugly<00:01:34.149> alright<00:01:35.149> and<00:01:35.329> that<00:01:35.929> is

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:36.139 
if the baby is ugly alright and that is

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:38.889 
if the baby is ugly alright and that is
our<00:01:36.349> reality<00:01:37.099> is<00:01:37.249> that<00:01:37.759> the<00:01:37.909> new<00:01:38.090> ideas<00:01:38.630> are

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
our reality is that the new ideas are

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.319 
our reality is that the new ideas are
fragile<00:01:39.649> they<00:01:40.009> don't<00:01:40.219> look<00:01:40.459> good<00:01:40.759> they<00:01:41.060> take

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
fragile they don't look good they take

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.319 
fragile they don't look good they take
protection<00:01:41.719> you<00:01:42.469> cannot<00:01:42.829> judge<00:01:43.249> them<00:01:43.549> at<00:01:44.060> that

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
protection you cannot judge them at that

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:47.469 
protection you cannot judge them at that
point<00:01:44.770> you<00:01:45.770> you<00:01:46.130> can<00:01:46.340> see<00:01:46.759> how<00:01:46.789> well<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:47.240> team

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
point you you can see how well the team

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.239 
point you you can see how well the team
is<00:01:47.659> working<00:01:47.779> together<00:01:48.139> but<00:01:48.590> you<00:01:48.679> can't<00:01:48.979> judge

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:49.249 
is working together but you can't judge

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:52.690 
is working together but you can't judge
the<00:01:49.429> ideas<00:01:49.880> now<00:01:50.840> so<00:01:51.469> we<00:01:51.799> have<00:01:51.829> to<00:01:52.039> go<00:01:52.159> from<00:01:52.340> that

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
the ideas now so we have to go from that

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.019 
the ideas now so we have to go from that
stage<00:01:53.060> to<00:01:54.049> somehow<00:01:54.409> with<00:01:54.619> engagement<00:01:55.429> with

00:01:56.019 --> 00:01:56.029 
stage to somehow with engagement with

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:57.809 
stage to somehow with engagement with
that<00:01:56.299> beast<00:01:56.840> and<00:01:57.139> this<00:01:57.200> is<00:01:57.380> a<00:01:57.409> long<00:01:57.679> process

00:01:57.809 --> 00:01:57.819 
that beast and this is a long process

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:00.190 
that beast and this is a long process
but<00:01:58.819> the<00:01:58.969> normal<00:01:59.299> thing<00:01:59.479> that<00:01:59.630> happens<00:02:00.020> is
