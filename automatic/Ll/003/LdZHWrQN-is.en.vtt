00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.349
 hello welcome to my game of the month in 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.539
 this Saturday afternoon we invite you to 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.190
 try things a card game of 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:17.220
 Renier starts or that had taught us 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.169
 in a news video and let's see 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.580
 here on this afternoon how is your 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:23.160
 functioning that is a game of the most 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.220
 entertaining especially for groups of 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.869
 medium size would have 5 or 6 players 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.660
 up to 8 that allows is a very game 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.640
 entertaining very simple and that will make us 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.380
 spend a very good evening developing the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.290
 controls that the game contains does not have 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.450
 nothing more than this letters a huge in 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.060
 March of letters between these letters 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.910
 we have several types of them the most 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.710
 normal are corsair cards that are 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.800
 letters as you see colors where there 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.450
 boats of different colors we have 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.570
 four colors we have yellow we have 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:58.440
 green we have blue we have red are 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.020
 letters of corsair ships trying 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.610
 conquer galleons and that are the 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.619
 galleons then that 's the other kind of 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.479
 letters of ships letters that come with 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.860
 a color as well as yellow and have a 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.060
 value if you notice you have a value 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.890
 numeric 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.829
 what it costs with some doubloons what 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.299
 cost these galleons with the points 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:17.820
 rather let's say that the gold that we 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.789
 they contribute these cannons and to complete 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.210
 we have some letters of four characters 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:25.770
 corsair characters and a character that 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.039
 is on the side of the good between 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.090
 quotes we have done to the green pirate 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:31.799
 yellow pirate that perfect looks like 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.600
 very much full davis on the island of 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.970
 severed heads if you have not seen 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.860
 It's an entertaining pirate movie 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.170
 blue pirate and red pirate all come 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.229
 with your name and here we have the 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.970
 admiral that is let's say the pirate to 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.459
 corsair of the audio of the flights 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.899
 let's play this is very simple it 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:52.770
 they distribute the charges between the players 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.259
 and in each turn each player per round 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.179
 You can make one of two or steal a card 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.189
 of the deck image 2 here I have a few 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:02.520
 we have a central deck because he can steal 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.860
 a card of the central deck and stay the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.119
 watch him stay no no hand limit 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.420
 we can not have all the letters that 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.950
 we want in your hand or you can play a 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.840
 letter from your hand is not like that 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.550
 simple does not steal a card or play 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.040
 a letter 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.300
 the next how the cards are played to 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.130
 when playing cards we can 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.890
 play the cards according to this type that you 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.630
 they taught and it works a little bit all kings 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.410
 teacher is a tiny example so that 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.510
 you see it a little on the fly 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.980
 first of all we can play lions and 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.510
 we have letters in the hand of galleon 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.060
 like the ones that taught us we can play 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.680
 the galleon and the table the galleon is the one 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.870
 will allow us to win the game I know that 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.520
 will give us points where to put so that what 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.160
 see on your side is what will give us 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.570
 points therefore play a galleon in hand 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.150
 to the table can make me earn points 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.010
 or that others earn points this galleon 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.630
 must survive the entire combat round 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.190
 for the whole game round that is me 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.440
 what game did he take down to the minimarket and hand to 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.840
 the table and then throw all the 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.310
 players like 6 or steal or play 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.050
 a letter and when I go back to touch 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.880
 me without anyone attacking this truck I 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.280
 I've kept it and won those of this 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.870
 example three points of this galleon is 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.280
 played a more powerful galleon for example 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:12.660
 it is in 6 but of 9 but of 6 it is game 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.430
 this galleon of 6 would take me to the 6 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.710
 points and after all the rumba nobody 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.170
 he has attacked him with I am and look more 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.460
 strong bankia sixth of the attacks then 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.650
 I did not want people to lions and is 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.300
 millions you will have plus another of the 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.860
 options is to play from the hand a 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.530
 letter like the ones I've designed for you 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.240
 these colors of corsairs and what 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.440
 curious about this game is that in the hand 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.550
 we have layers 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.040
 the colors if not every player 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.000
 be a color we are not all all in 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.580
 any time I can get off 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.110
 any color of corsair to attack 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:47.340
 a galleon 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:49.440
 we usually get six powerful 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.680
 I can play any color by 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:57.030
 example you play this pirate the green 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.440
 that has a score of 3 good is 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.940
 the next player's round will be 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.070
 lions let's say the player before me 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.100
 for example and now any other 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.630
 player can play another pirate another 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.070
 corsair in this case put them to 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.800
 right in this case it would be a corsair 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.030
 of value 2 blue color logically not 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.010
 you can repeat colors if you have not played 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.330
 a green corsair no one else's 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.190
 players you can play another corsair 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.440
 green having to play another color not 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.870
 It matters what we imagine that this is due 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.610
 if I go back to be my turn and here is 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.710
 another free galleon I can play it for 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.300
 example a red galleon nothing prevents me 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.550
 play a red ball even though I already do 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.820
 who has played a green truck does not pass 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.410
 nothing is possible to change the color as 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.390
 I say the color is not associated with each 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.280
 player but at all times he 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:41.610
 You can play what you could do is 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.169
 play a galleon let's say a blue lioness 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.180
 here because I've already played one green 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.080
 against this a pardon a pirate ship 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.090
 blue 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.670
 playing a green against this galleon I 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:55.000
 I can only compete with the green color 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:57.370
 if another player comes and contrast that 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.810
 playing in red also plays in blue with 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.000
 a value of 3 the value is higher 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.170
 when they are over when you take the 4 in 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.480
 the cannibals as he said if after 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:07.960
 of all the round nobody has attacked me 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.940
 I wear it is my own galleon or when the 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.290
 galleon is of another let's say when he 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.020
 play again the player who has put 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.120
 a pirate a corsair and is the greatest 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.340
 value has endured the whole round with 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.410
 greater value is carried using a 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.540
 example so you can see how simple I 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.850
 game against this galleon of value 3 or 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.860
 I play my red corsair of value 2 on 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.110
 next player will decide to put and play 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.610
 his cosary of value 3 of blue color no 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.040
 can play red for the player the 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.500
 play in blue the 7 player passes and now 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.380
 it touches me again 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.960
 If I play something else, I'll go for another 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.090
 year of a slump to a letter when you 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.890
 again, there is the blue player like 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.510
 has the highest value holding all 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.580
 the round with the highest value is 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.770
 would take the galleon the three points and 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.090
 these would be discarded but if I want 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.850
 avoid that my turn can I play for 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:56.580
 example a second a second boat 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.320
 corsair of the same color he had and 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.650
 Now I have four strengths 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.630
 the stress has three could play another 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.010
 fonsi would like with the following if 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.530
 you come back to the whole round 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:09.240
 touch me and it keeps my letters with 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:11.370
 the maximum value then I take the 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.890
 galleon I keep these three points 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:16.770
 least I keep in my heap as a reward and 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:19.590
 the corsair letters are downloaded 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.720
 and so we continue to play against all 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.400
 galleons we're leaving here we have this 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.230
 for example with all calibers up 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.660
 Let the cards run out at the moment 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:30.500
 in which they took out the letters the 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.810
 game and you have to count the points 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.910
 in the best they are good, they value more 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.610
 Lions earn but if we have qualities 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.380
 in the hand they are discounted we can not 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.090
 stay with Welsh in your hand to 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.250
 purpose you have to go playing the and for 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.200
 last for the pirates or the 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.970
 pirates are worth to support the 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.700
 corsairs and they always give the most value 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:51.710
 high imagine that this is so you 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.820
 touches the yellow player of amount 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.410
 he enlarged the green and the yellow player 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:58.310
 the yellow captain plays he can not play 

00:06:54.410 --> 00:07:00.680
 good color if this happens to 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.970
 come back here and nobody has played another 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.510
 captain of another color would win the 

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.240
 yellow 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:07.669
 the pirate of that color is the one who 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:10.550
 It's worth it and what is it that we lack 

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:12.169
 of admiral good if the galleon is mine and 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:15.169
 this is so I can play at 

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:17.240
 Admiral as pirate of my own side 

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:19.430
 it only goes to defend our own 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.260
 galleons is pretty simple the truth is 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.340
 a very funny game we have it 

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.960
 available in our store and os 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:26.140
 we recommend for a good afternoon of 

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.140
 Saturday
