00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 we do not talk about color gives you the fear or you 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.740
 Grab a little stress thinking 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.540
 when one talks about having two or three 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.219
 colors in a head has to be done 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.219
 a decoration or it has to be done 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.440
 you have to do one 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.440
 today we have 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.490
 a colored head 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:37.079
 today it is used two out of three out of four or 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.550
 whatever is important is the combination as 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.550
 it's called that's a fusion 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.090
 you know that the idea is to create different 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.610
 types of techniques for example in the 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.859
 lounge we have one called moon table 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.170
 which is the front part of a test bowl 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.670
 lounge so doing like a half moon and 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.799
 the front has a color and the 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.970
 back has another one the 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.619
 we call 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.380
 tricolors that we casually play with 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.420
 three different colors and others 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.310
 we gave stars that in the part goes up 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:20.290
 the caixa becomes a color and then in 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:22.390
 the rest game star has two 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.369
 Very cute colors and it's good outfits 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.289
 do not wear the black that you 're 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.720
 using normally are not black or that 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:30.729
 It's great and you know how good this is 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.619
 these techniques are very easy to do 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.570
 they are with colors in some cases 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.340
 permanent and in other cases colors that 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.050
 they leave being with the washings that is 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.509
 a woman if she has a head of hair 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.600
 example a chestnut we can change that 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.500
 tonality creating a game of colors 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.630
 working as it said very well you 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.520
 Javier and creating a little more light 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.649
 of contrast and this makes the woman 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.569
 be totally different creating this 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.670
 technique like that with colors that are going 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:56.049
 being programmed the woman later to 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.110
 the two months can again have a 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.509
 totally natural way things that do not 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.690
 make them for a little while to spend different 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.220
 exactly the panic is to say u and y 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.380
 now that we are not this is very 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.299
 easy same for those who are a 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.580
 little bit more rooted as we say and what 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:14.440
 they want the best to touch their hair 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.360
 in the roots we can play with the 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.370
 effect as well as you have your favorite of 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.560
 the men or the ends more tiers that 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.690
 can also be done with color no 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.030
 you need to decorate or that is 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.800
 many alternatives nowadays for 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.080
 that a woman has a head with a lot 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.240
 shine a radiant color and they can 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.280
 have fun showing what is fashionable what 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.500
 what is a trend and what is a head 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.230
