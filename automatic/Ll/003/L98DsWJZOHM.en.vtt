Brundle<00:00:36.390> tipped<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.930> mail<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.079> think<00:00:37.410> that

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:37.560 
Brundle tipped the mail I think that

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.920

might<00:00:37.829> be<00:00:37.860> Alice<00:00:38.250> powell<00:00:38.520> who's<00:00:39.270> upside<00:00:39.690> down

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
might be Alice powell who's upside down

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.280 
might be Alice powell who's upside down
and<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.649> barriers<00:00:41.070> there<00:00:42.050> certainly<00:00:43.050> she

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
and in the barriers there certainly she

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.310 
and in the barriers there certainly she
was<00:00:43.500> next<00:00:43.860> super<00:00:44.370> Andale<00:00:44.670> but<00:00:45.660> actually<00:00:46.290> I

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
was next super Andale but actually I

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.630 
was next super Andale but actually I
think<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.559> saw<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.710> flash<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.130> a<00:00:47.220> pink<00:00:47.460> helmet

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640
