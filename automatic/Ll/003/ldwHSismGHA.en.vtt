00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
your home and trust me we've looked at

all kind of modeling in terms of seeing
if<00:01:39.840> there's<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.079> way<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.640> be<00:01:41.640> able<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.970> do<00:01:42.119> that

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
if there's a way to be able to do that

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.260 
if there's a way to be able to do that
we<00:01:42.570> haven't<00:01:42.750> cracked<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.350> nut<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.130> we<00:01:45.090> do

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
we haven't cracked that nut and so we do

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.929 
we haven't cracked that nut and so we do
not<00:01:45.390> bottle<00:01:45.869> tap<00:01:46.110> water<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.649> so<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.579> terms<00:01:47.790> of

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
not bottle tap water and so in terms of

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.940 
not bottle tap water and so in terms of
providing<00:01:48.270> engineered<00:01:48.990> beverages<00:01:49.560> we've<00:01:49.740> got

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
providing engineered beverages we've got

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.590 
providing engineered beverages we've got
to<00:01:50.070> get<00:01:50.189> them<00:01:50.340> from<00:01:50.490> point<00:01:50.790> A<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:50.909> point<00:01:51.090> B<00:01:51.360> and

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
to get them from point A to point B and

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.330 
to get them from point A to point B and
that's<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.960> primary<00:01:52.229> reason<00:01:52.500> in<00:01:52.950> terms<00:01:53.189> of

that's the primary reason in terms of

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.730 
that's the primary reason in terms of
using<00:01:53.729> packaging<00:01:54.659> but<00:01:55.290> there<00:01:55.409> is<00:01:55.530> also

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
using packaging but there is also

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.340 
using packaging but there is also
consideration<00:01:56.579> around<00:01:56.820> functionality<00:01:57.600> next

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
consideration around functionality next

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.139 
consideration around functionality next
is<00:01:58.469> around<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:58.950> around<00:01:59.340> light<00:01:59.640> weighting<00:02:00.030> and

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
is around is around light weighting and

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.190 
is around is around light weighting and
and<00:02:00.780> you're<00:02:01.140> using<00:02:01.469> less<00:02:01.829> materials<00:02:03.079> you<00:02:04.079> know

and you're using less materials you know
we've<00:02:04.439> been<00:02:04.469> doing<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.070> since<00:02:05.310> the

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
we've been doing this since the

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.940 
we've been doing this since the
beginning<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.600> company<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.200> no<00:02:07.710> surprise

beginning of the company and no surprise

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.090 
beginning of the company and no surprise
because<00:02:08.459> it's<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.910> easiest<00:02:08.940> way<00:02:09.360> in<00:02:09.539> terms<00:02:09.720> of

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
because it's the easiest way in terms of

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.979 
because it's the easiest way in terms of
reducing<00:02:11.100> costs<00:02:11.370> I<00:02:11.760> think<00:02:12.329> everybody<00:02:12.750> in<00:02:12.900> the

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
reducing costs I think everybody in the
