00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.170 
kind of revamp but then again I suppose

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.800 
kind of revamp but then again I suppose
from<00:05:30.500> a<00:05:30.590> business<00:05:30.800> point<00:05:31.100> of<00:05:31.220> view<00:05:31.660> that's<00:05:32.660> not

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
from a business point of view that's not

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.530 
from a business point of view that's not
really<00:05:33.020> going<00:05:33.140> to<00:05:33.230> help<00:05:33.350> them<00:05:33.880> so<00:05:34.880> I<00:05:34.910> can<00:05:35.090> I<00:05:35.300> cut

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:35.540 
really going to help them so I can I cut

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.000 
really going to help them so I can I cut
the<00:05:35.660> bell<00:05:35.810> again<00:05:35.930> what<00:05:36.530> actually<00:05:36.770> think<00:05:36.950> about

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
the bell again what actually think about

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.460 
the bell again what actually think about
it<00:05:37.280> it's<00:05:38.270> not<00:05:38.450> gonna<00:05:38.660> be<00:05:38.780> beneficial<00:05:39.260> for<00:05:39.320> them

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
it it's not gonna be beneficial for them

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.650 
it it's not gonna be beneficial for them
so<00:05:39.650> then<00:05:39.800> while<00:05:40.100> they<00:05:40.250> do<00:05:40.310> as<00:05:40.670> you<00:05:41.180> so<00:05:41.390> much
