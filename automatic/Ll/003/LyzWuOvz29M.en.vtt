beefier so good in the MVC to 500s where
we<00:00:11.610> go<00:00:11.759> is<00:00:11.910> excuse<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.389> noise<00:00:12.420> in<00:00:12.660> the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
so I'm running with the samples of often

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.150 
so I'm running with the samples of often
from<00:00:25.680> drums

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
from drums

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:56.810 
kind of chop that stuff up you can get a

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.000 
kind of chop that stuff up you can get a
nice<00:00:57.050> little<00:00:57.260> sound<00:00:59.320> basically<00:01:00.320> why<00:01:00.650> that<00:01:00.890> is

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
nice little sound basically why that is

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.960 
nice little sound basically why that is
a<00:01:01.040> Python<00:01:03.010> and<00:01:04.010> I<00:01:04.160> chopped<00:01:04.400> up<00:01:04.489> those<00:01:04.670> notes

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
a Python and I chopped up those notes

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:18.660 
a Python and I chopped up those notes
which<00:01:05.780> you<00:01:05.810> can<00:01:06.050> see<00:01:06.200> up<00:01:06.320> on<00:01:06.470> here<00:01:06.680> now<00:01:16.930> yeah

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670

which<00:01:24.770> were

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:39.510 

and<00:01:31.880> example<00:01:32.360> those<00:01:32.540> which<00:01:32.810> come<00:01:32.960> out<00:01:33.079> like<00:01:33.290> so

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.570 

straight<00:01:40.520> stuff<00:01:43.060> after<00:01:44.060> that<00:01:44.090> I<00:01:44.240> changed<00:01:45.399> rota

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
straight stuff after that I changed rota

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.730 
straight stuff after that I changed rota
