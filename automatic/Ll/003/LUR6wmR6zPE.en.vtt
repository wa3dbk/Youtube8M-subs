hi guys we've got a digital keypad added

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.390 
hi guys we've got a digital keypad added
to<00:00:05.819> our<00:00:05.879> laid<00:00:06.120> here<00:00:06.569> and<00:00:07.020> today's<00:00:07.859> video<00:00:08.250> is

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
to our laid here and today's video is

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.990 
to our laid here and today's video is
all<00:00:08.519> about<00:00:08.580> how<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.240> install<00:00:09.420> this<00:00:09.929> keypad<00:00:10.440> and

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.000 
all about how to install this keypad and

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.120 
all about how to install this keypad and
how<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.059> program<00:00:12.660> so<00:00:13.349> that<00:00:13.559> we<00:00:13.679> get<00:00:13.830> rid<00:00:14.040> of

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
how to program so that we get rid of

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.420 
how to program so that we get rid of
this<00:00:14.309> knob<00:00:14.969> which<00:00:15.240> got<00:00:15.480> turned<00:00:15.750> ten<00:00:16.020> times<00:00:16.430> let

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
this knob which got turned ten times let

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.279 
this knob which got turned ten times let
me<00:00:17.460> show<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:18.119> it's<00:00:18.480> still<00:00:18.810> controlling

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
me show you that it's still controlling

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.950 
me show you that it's still controlling
the<00:00:19.410> way<00:00:19.880> you<00:00:20.880> know<00:00:21.000> all<00:00:21.180> about<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:21.689> and

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
the way you know all about that and

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.800 
the way you know all about that and
we're<00:00:22.380> gonna<00:00:22.470> change<00:00:22.859> it<00:00:23.130> so<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:23.480> this<00:00:24.480> knob

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
we're gonna change it so that this knob

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.109 
we're gonna change it so that this knob
controls<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.740> lathe<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.340> set<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.609> one<00:00:26.820> turn

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
controls the lathe and a set of one turn

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.330 
controls the lathe and a set of one turn
Bob<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.960> will<00:00:28.080> go<00:00:28.199> from<00:00:28.410> your<00:00:28.470> zero<00:00:28.800> speed<00:00:29.130> to

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
Bob you will go from your zero speed to

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.959 
Bob you will go from your zero speed to
full<00:00:29.550> speed<00:00:29.820> 1<00:00:30.119> turn<00:00:31.309> the<00:00:32.309> other<00:00:32.430> thing<00:00:32.669> we<00:00:32.790> get

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
full speed 1 turn the other thing we get

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.490 
full speed 1 turn the other thing we get
out<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.239> this<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.540> information<00:00:33.840> on<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.380> way

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
out of this is information on the way

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.770 
out of this is information on the way
the<00:00:34.890> most<00:00:35.250> important<00:00:35.730> thing<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:35.969> fault<00:00:36.450> codes

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
the most important thing is fault codes

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.950 
the most important thing is fault codes
if<00:00:37.230> if<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.190> drive<00:00:38.460> should<00:00:38.820> fail<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.690> will<00:00:39.840> get

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
if if the drive should fail you will get

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.630 
if if the drive should fail you will get
a<00:00:39.989> fault<00:00:40.290> code<00:00:40.530> then<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:40.920> will<00:00:41.070> tell<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.399> why

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
a fault code then it will tell you why

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.160 
a fault code then it will tell you why
it<00:00:41.700> fits<00:00:42.500> and<00:00:43.610> we<00:00:44.610> have<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> problem<00:00:45.149> after<00:00:45.629> we

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
it fits and we have a problem after we

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.100 
it fits and we have a problem after we
install<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.660> when<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.750> put<00:00:48.960> the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
install this and when you put the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.889 
install this and when you put the
four-jaw<00:00:49.710> chuck<00:00:49.739> on<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:51.270> crank<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:51.840> up

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
four-jaw chuck on and you crank this up

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.080 
four-jaw chuck on and you crank this up
to<00:00:52.350> 2,000<00:00:53.160> RPM<00:00:53.670> when<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.750> decrease<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.260> speed

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
to 2,000 RPM when you decrease the speed

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.840 
to 2,000 RPM when you decrease the speed
the<00:00:57.090> drive<00:00:57.360> shuts<00:00:57.660> down<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.489> get<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.550> fault

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
the drive shuts down and you get a fault

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.660 
the drive shuts down and you get a fault
code<00:01:00.090> on<00:01:00.300> here<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.629> says<00:01:01.129> hu<00:01:02.129> which<00:01:02.399> stands

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
code on here that says hu which stands

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.770 
code on here that says hu which stands
for<00:01:02.879> high<00:01:03.030> voltage<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.799> what<00:01:04.799> happened<00:01:05.309> is

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
for high voltage and what happened is

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.760 
for high voltage and what happened is
this<00:01:06.780> big<00:01:07.140> Chuck<00:01:09.200> when<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.320> slowed<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.740> down

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
this big Chuck when you slowed it down

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.310 
this big Chuck when you slowed it down
was<00:01:11.189> driving<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.970> motor<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.510> making<00:01:13.229> the

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
was driving the motor and making the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.020 
was driving the motor and making the
motor<00:01:13.500> act<00:01:13.770> like<00:01:13.950> it's<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.220> generator<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.939> then

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
motor act like it's a generator and then

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.149 
motor act like it's a generator and then
it<00:01:15.330> was<00:01:15.450> putting<00:01:15.750> power<00:01:16.049> back<00:01:16.200> into<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.860> drive

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
it was putting power back into the drive

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.700 
it was putting power back into the drive
and<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.150> raises<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.869> voltage<00:01:19.259> in<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.500> drive

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
and that raises the voltage in the drive

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.560 
and that raises the voltage in the drive
and<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.040> can<00:01:20.189> damage<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.640> drive<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
and that can damage the drive so the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.539 
and that can damage the drive so the
drive<00:01:21.810> sense<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.320> high<00:01:22.590> voltage<00:01:22.799> shuts

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
drive sense is that high voltage shuts

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.630 
drive sense is that high voltage shuts
the<00:01:23.700> drive<00:01:23.909> down<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.799> and<00:01:25.799> gives<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.220> fault

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
the drive down and and gives you a fault

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.219 
the drive down and and gives you a fault
message<00:01:27.060> now<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.270> go<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.659> manual<00:01:28.080> you

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
message now you go to the manual you

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.890 
message now you go to the manual you
look<00:01:28.470> up<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.650> fault<00:01:29.100> message<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.630> find

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
look up that fault message and you find

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.890 
look up that fault message and you find
out<00:01:31.079> for<00:01:31.320> high<00:01:31.979> voltage<00:01:32.189> shutdown<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.540> can<00:01:33.780> be

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
out for high voltage shutdown it can be

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.920 
out for high voltage shutdown it can be
caused<00:01:34.140> by<00:01:34.439> high<00:01:34.799> inertia<00:01:35.310> load<00:01:35.790> which<00:01:36.780> is

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
caused by high inertia load which is

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.359 
caused by high inertia load which is
what<00:01:37.110> we<00:01:37.229> have<00:01:37.409> with<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.619> big<00:01:37.920> 4<00:01:38.159> jaw<00:01:38.340> Chuck

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
what we have with that big 4 jaw Chuck

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.649 
what we have with that big 4 jaw Chuck
and<00:01:39.290> there's<00:01:40.290> two<00:01:40.770> ways<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:40.979> fix<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.490> part<00:01:41.820> ok

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
and there's two ways to fix this part ok

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.830 
and there's two ways to fix this part ok
the<00:01:43.049> way<00:01:43.170> grizzly<00:01:43.619> did<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.299> if<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.509> very

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
the way grizzly did it is if you very

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.649 
the way grizzly did it is if you very
very<00:01:46.350> slowly<00:01:46.860> turn<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.369> knob<00:01:47.759> down<00:01:48.060> from

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
very slowly turn the knob down from

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.639 
very slowly turn the knob down from
2,000<00:01:49.290> rpm<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.549> drive<00:01:50.790> won't<00:01:51.030> set<00:01:51.240> down<00:01:51.360> and

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
2,000 rpm the drive won't set down and

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.830 
2,000 rpm the drive won't set down and
that's<00:01:52.649> why<00:01:52.950> they<00:01:53.490> put<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:53.909> ten<00:01:54.240> turn<00:01:54.540> knob

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
that's why they put this ten turn knob

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.220 
that's why they put this ten turn knob
in<00:01:55.110> here<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.670> could

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
in here is so that you could

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.260 
in here is so that you could
not<00:01:57.440> turn<00:01:57.800> it<00:01:57.950> down<00:01:58.130> fast<00:01:58.430> enough<00:01:58.820> to<00:01:59.000> make<00:01:59.120> the

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
not turn it down fast enough to make the

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.960 
not turn it down fast enough to make the
drive<00:01:59.510> shut<00:01:59.840> down<00:02:00.250> dude<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.400> motor<00:02:01.610> acts<00:02:01.820> like

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
drive shut down dude the motor acts like

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.140 
drive shut down dude the motor acts like
a<00:02:02.150> generator<00:02:02.950> so<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.310> other<00:02:04.460> way<00:02:04.640> to<00:02:04.700> fix<00:02:04.970> this

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
a generator so the other way to fix this

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.830 
a generator so the other way to fix this
problem<00:02:05.410> for<00:02:06.410> the<00:02:06.500> VFD<00:02:06.920> manual<00:02:07.400> as<00:02:08.030> they<00:02:08.600> say

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
problem for the VFD manual as they say

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.570 
problem for the VFD manual as they say
if<00:02:08.990> you<00:02:09.110> have<00:02:09.290> this<00:02:09.500> fault<00:02:09.800> code<00:02:10.070> and<00:02:10.280> you<00:02:10.340> have

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
if you have this fault code and you have

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.850 
if you have this fault code and you have
a<00:02:10.610> high<00:02:10.850> inertia<00:02:11.150> loan<00:02:11.540> you<00:02:12.230> should<00:02:12.440> install<00:02:12.800> a

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
a high inertia loan you should install a

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.550 
a high inertia loan you should install a
brake<00:02:13.160> resistor<00:02:13.870> so<00:02:14.870> I<00:02:14.900> did<00:02:15.140> that<00:02:15.260> I<00:02:15.350> bought

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
brake resistor so I did that I bought

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.830 
brake resistor so I did that I bought
one<00:02:15.740> they<00:02:15.890> cost<00:02:16.340> me<00:02:16.490> 26<00:02:16.940> bucks<00:02:17.150> I<00:02:17.450> installed

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
one they cost me 26 bucks I installed

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.590 
one they cost me 26 bucks I installed
the<00:02:17.960> brake<00:02:18.140> resistor<00:02:18.710> on<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:18.980> drive<00:02:19.600> problems

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
the brake resistor on the drive problems

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.870 
the brake resistor on the drive problems
you<00:02:21.260> can<00:02:21.410> now<00:02:21.560> turn<00:02:21.950> this<00:02:22.100> down<00:02:22.310> as<00:02:22.490> fast<00:02:22.640> as

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
you can now turn this down as fast as

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.660 
you can now turn this down as fast as
you<00:02:23.000> walk<00:02:23.240> through<00:02:23.510> 2,000<00:02:24.110> rpm<00:02:24.530> and<00:02:24.800> it<00:02:25.490> won't

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
you walk through 2,000 rpm and it won't

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.550 
you walk through 2,000 rpm and it won't
shut<00:02:25.850> the<00:02:25.970> driver<00:02:27.820> okay<00:02:28.820> so<00:02:29.410> that's<00:02:30.410> the

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
shut the driver okay so that's the

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.380 
shut the driver okay so that's the
benefit<00:02:30.950> you<00:02:31.130> get<00:02:31.310> so<00:02:31.550> let's<00:02:31.700> just<00:02:32.030> get<00:02:32.210> into

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
benefit you get so let's just get into

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.990 
benefit you get so let's just get into
how<00:02:33.080> we<00:02:33.140> install<00:02:33.620> this<00:02:33.890> I<00:02:34.280> might<00:02:34.580> as<00:02:34.670> well<00:02:34.700> shut

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
how we install this I might as well shut

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.610 
how we install this I might as well shut
this<00:02:35.180> off<00:02:35.390> so<00:02:35.720> I<00:02:35.750> can<00:02:35.960> hear<00:02:36.170> a<00:02:36.200> little<00:02:36.380> better

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
this off so I can hear a little better

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.760 
this off so I can hear a little better
first<00:02:37.520> thing<00:02:37.700> you<00:02:37.760> need<00:02:37.910> to<00:02:37.940> do<00:02:38.210> is<00:02:38.600> read<00:02:39.590> these

first thing you need to do is read these

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.570 
first thing you need to do is read these
instructions<00:02:40.690> for<00:02:41.690> the<00:02:41.780> keypad<00:02:42.310> they've<00:02:43.310> got

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
instructions for the keypad they've got

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.450 
instructions for the keypad they've got
a<00:02:44.060> drawing<00:02:44.750> on<00:02:45.050> here<00:02:45.410> they<00:02:45.800> tell<00:02:46.010> you<00:02:46.100> the<00:02:46.250> size

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
a drawing on here they tell you the size

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.330 
a drawing on here they tell you the size
of<00:02:46.700> screws<00:02:46.970> you<00:02:47.270> need<00:02:47.450> to<00:02:47.780> go<00:02:48.110> in<00:02:48.260> each<00:02:48.440> into

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
of screws you need to go in each into

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.930 
of screws you need to go in each into
two<00:02:49.550> corners<00:02:50.030> here<00:02:51.430> they<00:02:52.430> tell<00:02:52.640> you<00:02:52.730> three

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
two corners here they tell you three

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.290 
two corners here they tell you three
ways<00:02:53.120> to<00:02:53.150> install<00:02:53.720> it<00:02:54.820> you<00:02:55.820> also<00:02:55.970> tell<00:02:56.180> you<00:02:56.240> how

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
ways to install it you also tell you how

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.080 
ways to install it you also tell you how
to<00:02:56.330> program<00:02:56.570> it<00:02:56.900> too<00:02:57.430> so<00:02:58.430> let's<00:02:58.610> get<00:02:58.730> into<00:02:58.970> that

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
to program it too so let's get into that

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.570 
to program it too so let's get into that
what<00:02:59.360> I<00:02:59.390> chose<00:02:59.780> was<00:03:00.290> a<00:03:00.530> surface<00:03:01.459> mount<00:03:02.230> and

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
what I chose was a surface mount and

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.740 
what I chose was a surface mount and
because<00:03:04.580> I<00:03:04.700> don't<00:03:04.760> have<00:03:05.000> a<00:03:05.030> mill<00:03:05.300> here<00:03:05.570> right

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
because I don't have a mill here right

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.890 
because I don't have a mill here right
now<00:03:05.990> I<00:03:06.430> had<00:03:07.430> on<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:08.030> tools<00:03:08.270> I<00:03:08.450> had<00:03:08.600> to<00:03:08.720> where's

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
now I had on the tools I had to where's

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.180 
now I had on the tools I had to where's
the<00:03:09.080> drill<00:03:09.380> and<00:03:09.850> Dremel<00:03:10.850> with<00:03:11.540> a<00:03:11.570> cut-off<00:03:12.260> disc

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
the drill and Dremel with a cut-off disc

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.120 
the drill and Dremel with a cut-off disc
so<00:03:13.910> you<00:03:14.060> have<00:03:14.180> to<00:03:14.300> cut<00:03:14.510> a<00:03:14.540> square<00:03:15.440> opening<00:03:15.770> in

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
so you have to cut a square opening in

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.979 
so you have to cut a square opening in
here<00:03:16.310> rectangular<00:03:16.850> won't<00:03:17.030> be<00:03:17.180> for<00:03:17.360> this<00:03:17.510> plug

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
here rectangular won't be for this plug

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.110 
here rectangular won't be for this plug
on<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:18.320> end<00:03:18.350> the<00:03:18.560> cable<00:03:18.890> is<00:03:19.010> huge<00:03:19.340> one<00:03:19.940> and<00:03:20.090> a

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
on the end the cable is huge one and a

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.670 
on the end the cable is huge one and a
half<00:03:20.270> inches<00:03:20.600> high<00:03:20.690> by<00:03:21.020> half<00:03:21.200> an<00:03:21.380> inch<00:03:21.470> wide

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
half inches high by half an inch wide

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.290 
half inches high by half an inch wide
and<00:03:23.950> WIU's<00:03:24.950> puts<00:03:25.250> and<00:03:25.400> I<00:03:25.520> came<00:03:25.790> on<00:03:25.970> here<00:03:26.180> and

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
and WIU's puts and I came on here and

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.760 
and WIU's puts and I came on here and
laid<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:26.540> drawing<00:03:26.840> out<00:03:27.020> on<00:03:27.170> here<00:03:27.350> so<00:03:27.500> I'd<00:03:27.590> know

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
laid the drawing out on here so I'd know

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.740 
laid the drawing out on here so I'd know
where<00:03:27.950> to<00:03:28.040> cut<00:03:28.220> the<00:03:28.250> slot<00:03:28.610> and<00:03:29.300> drill<00:03:29.630> the

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
where to cut the slot and drill the

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.260 
where to cut the slot and drill the
holes<00:03:29.959> and<00:03:30.610> so<00:03:31.610> once<00:03:31.760> you<00:03:31.850> get<00:03:31.970> that<00:03:32.060> done<00:03:32.209> you

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
holes and so once you get that done you

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.720 
holes and so once you get that done you
feed<00:03:32.570> the<00:03:32.720> cable<00:03:33.080> through<00:03:33.110> here<00:03:33.620> and<00:03:33.800> fasten

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730

put<00:03:38.239> the<00:03:38.300> keypad<00:03:38.660> back<00:03:38.959> in<00:03:39.200> put<00:03:39.410> the<00:03:39.470> screws<00:03:39.739> on

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
put the keypad back in put the screws on

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.460 
put the keypad back in put the screws on
before<00:03:41.600> you<00:03:41.660> do<00:03:41.810> all<00:03:41.959> that<00:03:42.080> you<00:03:42.170> should<00:03:42.230> open

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
before you do all that you should open

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.560 
before you do all that you should open
take<00:03:42.860> this<00:03:43.010> panel<00:03:43.400> off<00:03:43.520> and<00:03:43.640> look<00:03:44.000> up<00:03:44.180> in<00:03:44.360> there

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
take this panel off and look up in there

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:45.850 
take this panel off and look up in there
with<00:03:44.720> a<00:03:44.780> flashlight<00:03:44.900> and<00:03:45.320> see<00:03:45.560> you<00:03:45.709> have

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
with a flashlight and see you have

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.710 
with a flashlight and see you have
exposed<00:03:46.310> spindle<00:03:46.880> bearings<00:03:47.209> you<00:03:47.360> can<00:03:47.480> see<00:03:47.600> the

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
exposed spindle bearings you can see the

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.140 
exposed spindle bearings you can see the
rollers<00:03:48.110> so<00:03:48.920> you've<00:03:49.220> got<00:03:49.459> to<00:03:49.610> cover<00:03:49.820> that<00:03:50.090> up

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
rollers so you've got to cover that up

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.479 
rollers so you've got to cover that up
before<00:03:50.630> you<00:03:50.900> start<00:03:50.930> drilling<00:03:51.500> and<00:03:51.800> grinding

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
before you start drilling and grinding

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.250 
before you start drilling and grinding
in<00:03:52.610> here<00:03:52.880> you<00:03:53.360> got<00:03:53.480> to<00:03:53.570> keep<00:03:53.660> those<00:03:53.810> bearings

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
in here you got to keep those bearings

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.070 
in here you got to keep those bearings
clean<00:03:54.500> so<00:03:54.980> okay<00:03:55.850> so<00:03:55.880> that<00:03:56.390> gets<00:03:56.570> the<00:03:56.690> keypad

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
clean so okay so that gets the keypad

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.670 
clean so okay so that gets the keypad
installed<00:03:57.560> and<00:03:58.480> wired<00:03:59.480> up<00:03:59.810> and<00:04:00.110> so<00:04:00.290> now<00:04:00.440> let's

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
installed and wired up and so now let's

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.910 
installed and wired up and so now let's
do<00:04:00.860> our<00:04:00.890> cable<00:04:01.430> routing<00:04:01.820> and<00:04:02.300> let<00:04:02.720> me<00:04:02.920> bring

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
do our cable routing and let me bring

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.600 
do our cable routing and let me bring
you<00:04:04.130> with<00:04:04.340> me

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.040 

so<00:04:07.300> here<00:04:07.960> we<00:04:08.110> go<00:04:08.610> got<00:04:09.610> drill<00:04:09.850> a<00:04:09.880> hole<00:04:10.150> here<00:04:10.540> cut

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
so here we go got drill a hole here cut

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.780 
so here we go got drill a hole here cut
a<00:04:11.080> slot<00:04:11.410> with<00:04:11.740> the<00:04:11.860> dremel<00:04:12.220> so<00:04:12.340> you<00:04:12.460> can<00:04:12.550> push

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
a slot with the dremel so you can push

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.600 
a slot with the dremel so you can push
the<00:04:12.970> cable<00:04:13.150> in<00:04:13.420> there<00:04:13.650> make<00:04:14.650> a<00:04:14.680> wire<00:04:15.010> wire

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
the cable in there make a wire wire

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.789 
the cable in there make a wire wire
guide<00:04:15.940> or<00:04:16.390> cable<00:04:16.720> guide<00:04:16.870> out<00:04:17.140> of<00:04:17.290> sheet<00:04:17.620> metal

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
guide or cable guide out of sheet metal

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.370 
guide or cable guide out of sheet metal
and<00:04:18.070> so<00:04:18.250> you<00:04:18.340> can<00:04:18.489> screw<00:04:18.760> it<00:04:18.850> into<00:04:19.000> here

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
and so you can screw it into here

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.830 
and so you can screw it into here
I<00:04:20.410> bought<00:04:21.160> this<00:04:21.400> cable<00:04:21.850> guide<00:04:22.030> and<00:04:22.420> this

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
I bought this cable guide and this

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.380 
I bought this cable guide and this
through<00:04:23.110> bolted<00:04:23.500> it<00:04:23.620> there<00:04:23.830> and<00:04:24.220> so<00:04:25.120> what<00:04:25.270> you

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
through bolted it there and so what you

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.600 
through bolted it there and so what you
want<00:04:25.570> to<00:04:25.630> end<00:04:25.840> up<00:04:26.020> with<00:04:26.260> is<00:04:26.530> a<00:04:26.800> mechanically

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
want to end up with is a mechanically

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.270 
want to end up with is a mechanically
secured<00:04:28.360> cable<00:04:28.870> that<00:04:29.020> can<00:04:29.170> never<00:04:29.470> fall<00:04:29.980> down

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
secured cable that can never fall down

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.210 
secured cable that can never fall down
in<00:04:30.670> these<00:04:30.820> gears<00:04:31.450> or<00:04:31.840> get<00:04:32.500> tangled<00:04:32.920> up<00:04:32.980> in<00:04:33.040> that

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
in these gears or get tangled up in that

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.110 
in these gears or get tangled up in that
belt<00:04:34.140> and<00:04:35.400> so<00:04:36.400> once<00:04:36.550> you<00:04:36.640> get<00:04:36.760> over<00:04:36.910> here<00:04:37.090> now

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
belt and so once you get over here now

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.900 
belt and so once you get over here now
you<00:04:37.270> can<00:04:37.420> feed<00:04:38.020> the<00:04:38.800> plug<00:04:39.100> through<00:04:39.490> this<00:04:39.640> hole

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
you can feed the plug through this hole

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.640 
you can feed the plug through this hole
you<00:04:40.540> got<00:04:40.690> plenty<00:04:40.870> of<00:04:41.020> room<00:04:41.170> to<00:04:41.200> get<00:04:41.320> the<00:04:41.470> plug

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
you got plenty of room to get the plug

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.360 
you got plenty of room to get the plug
through<00:04:41.890> there<00:04:42.100> and<00:04:42.400> so<00:04:43.560> we're<00:04:44.560> through<00:04:45.250> the

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
through there and so we're through the

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.220 
through there and so we're through the
gear<00:04:45.580> base<00:04:46.320> and<00:04:47.320> let's<00:04:48.100> go<00:04:48.280> back<00:04:48.310> here

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
gear base and let's go back here

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:55.170 
gear base and let's go back here
it's<00:04:50.230> a<00:04:50.320> little<00:04:50.590> tight<00:04:50.830> let<00:04:51.430> me<00:04:51.550> zoom<00:04:51.760> out<00:04:54.150> okay

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
it's a little tight let me zoom out okay

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.150 
it's a little tight let me zoom out okay
here's<00:04:55.510> that<00:04:55.690> break<00:04:56.080> resistor<00:04:56.740> we<00:04:56.890> talked

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
here's that break resistor we talked

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.430 
here's that break resistor we talked
about<00:04:57.340> and<00:05:00.570> it's<00:05:01.570> difficult<00:05:01.840> to<00:05:02.140> put<00:05:02.290> in

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
about and it's difficult to put in

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.320 
about and it's difficult to put in
because<00:05:02.770> these<00:05:02.950> wires<00:05:03.280> are<00:05:03.550> only<00:05:03.730> six<00:05:04.060> inches

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
because these wires are only six inches

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.580 
because these wires are only six inches
long<00:05:04.650> so<00:05:05.650> it<00:05:05.680> has<00:05:06.250> to<00:05:06.430> go<00:05:06.580> in<00:05:06.760> first<00:05:07.090> and

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
long so it has to go in first and

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.530 
long so it has to go in first and
fortunately<00:05:08.590> you<00:05:08.920> can<00:05:08.950> put<00:05:09.280> it<00:05:09.400> in<00:05:09.610> and<00:05:09.850> that

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
fortunately you can put it in and that

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.810 
fortunately you can put it in and that
these<00:05:10.810> openings<00:05:11.410> these<00:05:11.710> are<00:05:11.860> grills<00:05:12.130> not<00:05:12.460> fans

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
these openings these are grills not fans

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.270 
these openings these are grills not fans
or<00:05:13.150> just<00:05:13.300> openings<00:05:13.870> this<00:05:14.560> opening<00:05:14.980> is<00:05:15.070> big

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
or just openings this opening is big

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.090 
or just openings this opening is big
enough<00:05:15.490> that<00:05:15.550> you<00:05:15.850> can<00:05:16.770> install<00:05:17.770> the<00:05:17.950> brake

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
enough that you can install the brake

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.070 
enough that you can install the brake
resistor<00:05:18.640> and<00:05:18.820> get<00:05:19.030> this<00:05:19.210> panel<00:05:19.510> to<00:05:19.720> fit<00:05:19.930> over

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
resistor and get this panel to fit over

take the panel back off drill and tap
for<00:06:24.479> 832<00:06:25.479> it's<00:06:25.689> what<00:06:25.809> I<00:06:25.839> used<00:06:27.179> bring<00:06:28.179> it<00:06:28.269> back

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:28.419 
for 832 it's what I used bring it back

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:30.299 
for 832 it's what I used bring it back
over<00:06:28.689> and<00:06:28.839> thread<00:06:29.529> the<00:06:29.679> break<00:06:29.829> resistor
