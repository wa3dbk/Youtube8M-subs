00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.960 
in middle the Warlock tidehunter lane
was<00:04:57.880> more<00:04:58.090> effective<00:04:58.240> but<00:04:58.960> now<00:04:59.200> as<00:04:59.410> we<00:04:59.530> can<00:04:59.650> see

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
was more effective but now as we can see

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.340 
was more effective but now as we can see
Ezra<00:05:00.970> has<00:05:01.150> been<00:05:01.300> able<00:05:01.420> to<00:05:01.540> farm<00:05:01.750> up<00:05:01.900> enough<00:05:02.170> to

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
Ezra has been able to farm up enough to

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:08.820 
Ezra has been able to farm up enough to
have<00:05:02.770> a<00:05:02.800> very<00:05:05.280> potent<00:05:06.360> combination<00:05:07.680> with<00:05:08.680> his

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
have a very potent combination with his

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.560 
have a very potent combination with his
diffusal<00:05:09.310> blade<00:05:09.340> at<00:05:09.580> all<00:05:09.730> as<00:05:09.850> a<00:05:09.940> fit<00:05:10.120> of<00:05:10.240> all

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
diffusal blade at all as a fit of all

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.970 
diffusal blade at all as a fit of all
these<00:05:10.780> images<00:05:11.200> and<00:05:12.030> just<00:05:13.320> the<00:05:14.320> great<00:05:14.620> amount

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
these images and just the great amount

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.850 
these images and just the great amount
of<00:05:15.100> oh<00:05:15.310> and<00:05:15.580> there<00:05:15.700> goes<00:05:15.730> an<00:05:16.030> old<00:05:16.240> from<00:05:16.860> and

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
of oh and there goes an old from and

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.440 
of oh and there goes an old from and
they<00:05:18.100> do<00:05:18.160> get<00:05:18.400> a<00:05:18.460> kill<00:05:18.700> off<00:05:18.910> of<00:05:19.060> him<00:05:19.150> but<00:05:19.180> I<00:05:19.360> do

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
they do get a kill off of him but I do

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.390 
they do get a kill off of him but I do
think<00:05:19.750> they<00:05:19.900> could<00:05:20.140> actually<00:05:20.860> with<00:05:21.220> no

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
think they could actually with no

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.020 
think they could actually with no
disables<00:05:21.850> rosters<00:05:22.240> their<00:05:22.360> only<00:05:22.570> disabled<00:05:23.020> so

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
disables rosters their only disabled so

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.060 
disables rosters their only disabled so
as<00:05:25.030> Earth<00:05:25.450> can't<00:05:25.750> really<00:05:26.140> lean<00:05:26.350> into<00:05:26.650> anyone

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
as Earth can't really lean into anyone

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.159 
as Earth can't really lean into anyone
who's<00:05:27.250> being<00:05:27.460> netted<00:05:27.910> or<00:05:28.150> anything<00:05:28.990> like<00:05:29.020> that

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
who's being netted or anything like that

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.090 
who's being netted or anything like that
while<00:05:30.130> rasa<00:05:30.610> is<00:05:30.910> not<00:05:31.120> on<00:05:31.330> the<00:05:31.419> playing<00:05:31.660> field

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
while rasa is not on the playing field

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.230 
while rasa is not on the playing field
so<00:05:33.100> that<00:05:33.130> was<00:05:33.340> a<00:05:33.370> good<00:05:33.490> kill<00:05:33.730> from<00:05:33.850> the<00:05:33.970> Scourge

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
so that was a good kill from the Scourge

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.140 
so that was a good kill from the Scourge
kind<00:05:34.570> of<00:05:34.690> a<00:05:34.980> postponing<00:05:35.980> their<00:05:36.550> doom<00:05:36.850> for<00:05:37.120> a

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:58.430 
Akasha in a Lincoln some producer and

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.159 
Akasha in a Lincoln some producer and
you<00:06:59.030> just<00:06:59.150> gotta<00:06:59.360> say<00:06:59.419> this<00:06:59.660> matchup<00:07:00.020> was

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:00.169 
you just gotta say this matchup was

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:01.629 
you just gotta say this matchup was
pretty<00:07:00.440> funny<00:07:00.710> because<00:07:00.919> they<00:07:01.190> didn't<00:07:01.520> do

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:01.639 
pretty funny because they didn't do

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:03.339 
pretty funny because they didn't do
anything<00:07:02.210> that's<00:07:02.630> whole<00:07:02.810> game<00:07:02.990> they<00:07:03.110> kind<00:07:03.289> of

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:03.349 
anything that's whole game they kind of

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:05.170 
anything that's whole game they kind of
push<00:07:03.530> their<00:07:03.710> own<00:07:03.830> lanes<00:07:04.099> and<00:07:04.400> then<00:07:04.940> the<00:07:05.030> game

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:05.180 
push their own lanes and then the game

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.570 
push their own lanes and then the game
ended<00:07:05.539> so<00:07:05.900> I<00:07:06.380> mean<00:07:07.039> they<00:07:07.220> would<00:07:07.370> have<00:07:07.460> been<00:07:07.550> a

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:07.580 
ended so I mean they would have been a

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.899 
ended so I mean they would have been a
factor<00:07:07.820> if<00:07:08.090> the<00:07:08.240> game<00:07:08.389> and<00:07:08.539> continued<00:07:08.990> but<00:07:09.259> um

00:07:09.899 --> 00:07:09.909 
factor if the game and continued but um

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:15.040 
factor if the game and continued but um
it<00:07:10.909> did<00:07:11.180> so<00:07:11.770> it<00:07:12.770> just<00:07:12.830> kind<00:07:13.220> of<00:07:13.250> ended<00:07:13.430> and<00:07:14.120> and

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:15.050 
it did so it just kind of ended and and

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:16.600 
it did so it just kind of ended and and
they<00:07:15.470> kind<00:07:15.650> of<00:07:15.740> had<00:07:15.889> hung<00:07:16.039> out<00:07:16.190> there<00:07:16.370> laying

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:16.610 
they kind of had hung out there laying

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.450 
they kind of had hung out there laying
the<00:07:16.759> whole<00:07:16.849> game<00:07:17.060> trading<00:07:17.509> blows<00:07:17.720> so<00:07:18.560> although

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:19.460 
the whole game trading blows so although

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.649 
the whole game trading blows so although
as<00:07:19.669> you<00:07:19.789> can<00:07:19.970> see<00:07:20.210> Medusa<00:07:20.930> totally<00:07:21.470> outdid
