them<00:02:28.150> so<00:02:29.150> once<00:02:29.360> you<00:02:29.480> get<00:02:29.600> all<00:02:29.720> your<00:02:29.870> pinwheels

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
them so once you get all your pinwheels

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.229 
them so once you get all your pinwheels
made<00:02:30.739> then<00:02:31.160> you're<00:02:31.310> ready<00:02:31.489> to<00:02:31.580> start<00:02:31.940> laying

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
made then you're ready to start laying

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.600 
made then you're ready to start laying
them<00:02:32.480> on<00:02:32.600> your<00:02:32.810> pillow<00:02:33.019> so<00:02:33.319> the<00:02:34.130> first<00:02:34.370> thing

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
them on your pillow so the first thing

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.400 
them on your pillow so the first thing
I'm<00:02:34.730> going<00:02:34.760> to<00:02:35.030> do<00:02:35.239> is<00:02:35.390> I'm<00:02:35.540> going<00:02:35.750> to<00:02:35.810> mark<00:02:36.170> an

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
I'm going to do is I'm going to mark an

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:43.570 
I'm going to do is I'm going to mark an
inch<00:02:37.370> in<00:02:41.080> all<00:02:42.080> around<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.769> pillow<00:02:43.010> just<00:02:43.400> so<00:02:43.549> I

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
inch in all around the pillow just so I

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.930 
inch in all around the pillow just so I
have<00:02:43.850> a<00:02:44.120> mark<00:02:45.019> of<00:02:45.290> where<00:02:45.769> I<00:02:45.799> want<00:02:46.160> to<00:02:46.250> set<00:02:46.580> the

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
have a mark of where I want to set the

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.740 
have a mark of where I want to set the
pinwheels<00:02:49.000> so<00:02:50.000> I'm<00:02:50.060> just<00:02:50.180> going<00:02:50.330> to<00:02:50.390> use<00:02:50.569> this

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
pinwheels so I'm just going to use this

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.920 
pinwheels so I'm just going to use this
chalk<00:02:51.140> and<00:02:51.500> I'm<00:02:51.560> just<00:02:51.739> going<00:02:51.920> to<00:02:51.980> draw<00:02:52.250> a<00:02:52.930> line

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
chalk and I'm just going to draw a line

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.319 
chalk and I'm just going to draw a line
around<00:02:56.019> I'm<00:02:57.730> going<00:02:58.730> to<00:02:58.820> go<00:02:58.880> ahead<00:02:58.970> and<00:02:59.150> do<00:02:59.209> that

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
around I'm going to go ahead and do that

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.259 
around I'm going to go ahead and do that
all<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.600> way<00:02:59.690> around<00:02:59.780> the<00:03:00.049> whole<00:03:00.170> pillow<00:03:01.269> so

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
all the way around the whole pillow so

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:03.910 
all the way around the whole pillow so
once<00:03:02.450> I<00:03:02.570> have<00:03:02.750> that<00:03:02.780> done<00:03:02.930> I'm<00:03:03.350> just<00:03:03.410> going<00:03:03.890> to

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
once I have that done I'm just going to

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:19.050 
once I have that done I'm just going to
randomly<00:03:04.579> lay<00:03:06.880> my<00:03:07.880> pinwheels

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.150 

and<00:03:19.180> I'm<00:03:19.720> gonna<00:03:19.810> lay<00:03:20.020> them<00:03:20.230> out<00:03:20.380> until<00:03:20.890> I<00:03:20.950> get

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
and I'm gonna lay them out until I get

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.530 
and I'm gonna lay them out until I get
the<00:03:21.310> design<00:03:21.670> that<00:03:22.000> I<00:03:22.030> like<00:03:24.090> so<00:03:25.090> what<00:03:25.240> I've<00:03:25.360> done

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
the design that I like so what I've done

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.170 
the design that I like so what I've done
here<00:03:25.600> is<00:03:25.840> I've<00:03:26.050> glued<00:03:26.290> down<00:03:26.560> all<00:03:26.890> of<00:03:27.160> my<00:03:27.370> red

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
here is I've glued down all of my red

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.970 
here is I've glued down all of my red
and<00:03:28.330> white<00:03:28.480> pinwheels<00:03:29.080> and<00:03:29.380> now<00:03:29.590> I'm<00:03:29.770> going

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
and white pinwheels and now I'm going

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.460 
and white pinwheels and now I'm going
back<00:03:30.069> and<00:03:30.580> making<00:03:30.870> just<00:03:31.870> little<00:03:32.200> red

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
back and making just little red

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.750 
back and making just little red
pinwheels<00:03:33.040> and<00:03:33.870> filling<00:03:34.870> in<00:03:34.990> the<00:03:35.140> spots<00:03:35.760> so

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
pinwheels and filling in the spots so

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.979 
pinwheels and filling in the spots so
I'm<00:03:36.850> gonna<00:03:36.940> go<00:03:37.090> ahead<00:03:37.120> and<00:03:37.300> fill<00:03:37.600> in<00:03:37.630> all<00:03:37.870> the

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
I'm gonna go ahead and fill in all the

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.860 
I'm gonna go ahead and fill in all the
spots<00:03:38.410> and<00:03:39.310> then<00:03:40.090> we'll<00:03:40.239> go<00:03:40.330> on<00:03:40.480> to<00:03:40.600> the<00:03:40.660> next

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
spots and then we'll go on to the next

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.490 
spots and then we'll go on to the next
step<00:03:42.480> so<00:03:43.480> now<00:03:43.510> when<00:03:43.840> you<00:03:43.930> get<00:03:44.050> down<00:03:44.110> to<00:03:44.260> the

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
step so now when you get down to the

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.199 
step so now when you get down to the
places<00:03:44.830> where<00:03:45.190> there's<00:03:45.370> just<00:03:45.610> little<00:03:45.970> tiny

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
places where there's just little tiny

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:46.979 
places where there's just little tiny
spots

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
spots

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.990 
spots
I'm<00:03:47.050> just<00:03:47.770> taking<00:03:48.130> little<00:03:48.280> pieces<00:03:48.640> that<00:03:48.850> I

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
I'm just taking little pieces that I

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.300 
I'm just taking little pieces that I
fold<00:03:49.330> it<00:03:49.480> in<00:03:49.600> half<00:03:49.660> and<00:03:50.170> I'm<00:03:50.890> just<00:03:51.100> going<00:03:51.250> to

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
fold it in half and I'm just going to

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.070 
fold it in half and I'm just going to
attach<00:03:51.610> those<00:03:53.970> into<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.060> little<00:03:55.300> slots<00:03:55.690> and

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
attach those into the little slots and

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.540 
attach those into the little slots and
you<00:03:56.380> kind<00:03:56.560> of<00:03:56.620> have<00:03:56.769> to<00:03:56.800> work<00:03:57.010> them<00:03:57.220> in<00:03:57.340> there

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
you kind of have to work them in there

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:03.270 
you kind of have to work them in there
sometimes<00:03:58.090> and<00:04:01.410> then<00:04:02.410> just<00:04:02.620> fill<00:04:02.920> all<00:04:03.070> those

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
sometimes and then just fill all those

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:09.420 
sometimes and then just fill all those
little<00:04:03.610> slots<00:04:03.910> until<00:04:04.480> you<00:04:04.569> get<00:04:04.720> those<00:04:04.989> done<00:04:08.430> so

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
little slots until you get those done so

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.520 
little slots until you get those done so
since<00:04:09.730> this<00:04:09.880> is<00:04:10.090> a<00:04:10.120> no<00:04:10.390> sew<00:04:10.660> project<00:04:11.260> the<00:04:11.380> next

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
since this is a no sew project the next

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.880 
since this is a no sew project the next
thing<00:04:11.800> I'm<00:04:11.950> going<00:04:12.130> to<00:04:12.220> do<00:04:12.459> is<00:04:12.760> I'm<00:04:12.970> going<00:04:13.000> to

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.099 
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
glue<00:04:14.890> this<00:04:15.190> together<00:04:15.459> and<00:04:15.970> I'm<00:04:16.900> going<00:04:17.079> to

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.130 
leave this end open to stuff it I'm
going<00:04:20.979> to<00:04:21.130> run<00:04:21.370> glue<00:04:21.760> all<00:04:22.090> along<00:04:22.419> the<00:04:22.750> edge<00:04:22.900> a

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
going to run glue all along the edge a

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:44.220 
going to run glue all along the edge a
pretty<00:04:26.140> heavy<00:04:26.410> amount
