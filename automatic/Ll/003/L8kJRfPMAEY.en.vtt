it on the microwave for a minute and a

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.389 
it on the microwave for a minute and a
half<00:00:47.489> make<00:00:48.480> sure<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.590> watch<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.219> whole

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
half make sure you watch it the whole

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.330 
half make sure you watch it the whole
time<00:00:50.670> because<00:00:51.210> otherwise<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.870> will<00:00:51.930> burn<00:00:52.340> look

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
time because otherwise it will burn look

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.100 
time because otherwise it will burn look
what<00:00:53.460> happens<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.910> marshmallows<00:00:54.510> the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
what happens to the marshmallows the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.869 
what happens to the marshmallows the
heat<00:00:55.379> makes<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.949> expand<00:00:56.399> because

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
heat makes it expand because

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.549 
heat makes it expand because
marshmallows<00:00:57.480> are<00:00:57.600> filled<00:00:57.809> with<00:00:57.870> air<00:00:58.140> mostly

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
marshmallows are filled with air mostly

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.130 
marshmallows are filled with air mostly
so<00:00:59.340> as<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.579> heat<00:00:59.820> expands<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.629> just<00:01:00.989> gets

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
so as the heat expands it it just gets

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.120 
so as the heat expands it it just gets
bigger<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.739> bigger

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.060 

after<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.939> minute<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.299> half<00:01:09.900> use<00:01:10.470> hot<00:01:10.710> gloves

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
after a minute and a half use hot gloves

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.789 
after a minute and a half use hot gloves
to<00:01:11.430> take<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.759> out<00:01:12.170> careful<00:01:13.170> it's<00:01:13.320> really<00:01:13.350> hot

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
to take it out careful it's really hot

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.469
