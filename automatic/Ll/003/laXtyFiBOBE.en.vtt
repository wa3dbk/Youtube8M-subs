 ghislain available in toth version and 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.540
 a defense composed of cement to 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.330
 boards alain soral and then beasley 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.080

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.550
 Algerian who I think is in my club 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.800

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.710
 that's chelou as you see on the 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.910
 cottages pedaling very small but at the time 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.110

 the larch team why not this 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.780

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.790
 mls team are located then 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.860
