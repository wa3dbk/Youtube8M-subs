explain to people the reasons why it

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.940 
explain to people the reasons why it
takes<00:01:32.999> so<00:01:33.299> long<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.569> make<00:01:33.899> one<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.920> my

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.179 
takes so long to make one of my
wristwatches<00:01:36.049> what<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.079> often<00:01:37.590> find<00:01:37.889> very

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
wristwatches what I often find very

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.789 
wristwatches what I often find very
difficult<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.789> to<00:01:39.029> be<00:01:39.509> able<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.869> get<00:01:40.619> the

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
difficult is to be able to get the

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.010 
difficult is to be able to get the
message<00:01:41.130> across<00:01:41.249> about<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.869> amount<00:01:42.869> of

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
message across about the amount of

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.050 
message across about the amount of
involvement<00:01:43.319> the<00:01:43.740> handwork<00:01:44.159> which<00:01:44.459> goes<00:01:44.729> into

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
involvement the handwork which goes into

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.419 
involvement the handwork which goes into
