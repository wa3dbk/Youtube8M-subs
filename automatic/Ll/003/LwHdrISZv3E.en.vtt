00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.150
 I'll show them to you 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.830
 and a little bit about them own that 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.410
 telling it so for now let's skip 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:57.420
 it does not need so here so here and 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.700
 let's start to put them to arrange 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.040
 her consider them but this is a gravestone we 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.569
 and usually seen and if we break it 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.480
 stupino gets out a zombie 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.489
 there is also a cross if we break it 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.269
 it does not get out a zombie there is one in the coffin 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.920
 which fell lies on the ground there 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.420
 dog figurine that we can 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.549
 put on any solid block well 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.290
 let's say here we can put not 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.760
 can we can and I just on the floor 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.920
 put here a small figurine 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:28.410
 doggie or even a statuette 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:31.079
 little cat I love seals also 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:35.340
 I do not read correctly and it’s them 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:37.590
 spavner wetherall but somehow I 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.109
 it seems that it was pretty vain 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:45.239
 why do you need in the game minekravt spavner 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:47.209
 bizarro is in my opinion just go nuts well 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.859
 how peaceful done 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:53.489
 avizor disappears if described put before 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:55.650
 disappears everything is fine here for this for 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.290
 I think it's crazy why you exhale 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.930
 Need a spider visor but developers 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.780
 added let it mean there will also be 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.510
 we have a big huge cross just and 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.970
 how can i break without understanding well 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.980
 somehow it turned out there is such a 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:15.030
 statue of 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:17.910
 silicon if i'm not mistaken here next 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.160
 we are coming here 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:24.389
 such and even such in and along with 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:28.190
 such and here is such a statue of a zombie by 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:31.190
 the idea of ​​a statue of a resident statue 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.190
 crying 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.840
 I hope not crossed this mod that if 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.430
 here is an angel here are those who are weeping 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.440
 do not watch or vice versa with the third 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.430
 start chasing you well let's horses 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.830
 on we move away from there 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.889
 there is a statue on a pedestal with a doggie 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.740
 there is a statue on a pedestal with a cat 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:51.660
 and then on a pedestal with 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.520
 electrified creeper but not all 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:59.550
 so just dear friends let's go 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:04.169
 let's say we do the following we take 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:08.520
 from creative a huge number of blocks and 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:10.560
 do the following we will now take off and 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.080
 put put on on set on on 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.840
 we put on we put we deliver by deliver 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.760
 by on we put here let's jump now 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.849
 enter the game 1 command 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:24.419
 and now let's jump and see 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:28.590
 what will happen after that we jump 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:31.849
 crashed coming back and in theory where we are 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:37.770
 died we appear here such 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:41.700
 sword you see stuck and the sword he attaches 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:43.620
 us strength and we will return actually to 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:47.130
 review immediately after skipping 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:49.550
 night and so continue dear friends i 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:52.110
 you are not told what is at the time of death 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:55.080
 after your death actually appears 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:58.139
 Here is such a guide that he gives you 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.320
 it increases your strength, that is, if you 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:03.260
 will fight somewhere 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:06.320
 after let's say a lot of mobs 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:09.020
 then we can with the help of this 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.660
 such an object increase your strength but 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.060
 if we collect it then it will be normal 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:17.600
 the sword inside which will 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:20.090
 saved most of our items 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:23.240
 that is, it also performs the function as 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:25.540
 drive a and go ahead 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.190
 dear friends, I told you that a 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:30.670
 there are such statues in every possible way 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:34.280
 all kinds of animals let's say 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:36.730
 human we can give our name 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.980
 a statue told me about this stone 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:42.740
 I honestly don’t know what to groan 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:44.540
 for a stone that is generally practical 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.430
 I do not know the application 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:51.500
 as well but I can tell you what to 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:53.780
 cluster that's just such a statue tombstone 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.850
 actually here you see 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:59.900
 tombstone that is a resident of Omsk and then 

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:02.480
 there is a village often and very very 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.180
 will often spawn zombies skeleton and 

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:07.340
 all other things 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:10.910
 evil spirit and principle, and let's get on 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:14.180
 this will finish the pit told everything and 

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:16.220
