00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:07.740
 Hello everyone in this video, I would like you 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:11.190
 show cube build tutorial 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.280
 4 for 4 videos will most likely consist 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.830
 of 4 parts 1 in the first part I tell you 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.950
 I will tell about assembly of the centers in the second 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:26.390
 parts sound mating ribs 3 parts 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:30.500
 parity lpl and 4 i just show an example 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.060
 Iâ€™ll make a reservation for my assembly that Iâ€™m not 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.780
 worth watching a video if you can't 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.340
 collect 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.760
 a regular cop 3 by 3 should not waste time 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.789
 so let's go 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.660
 first video here is morphy center 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:45.660
 means 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:52.950
 I will show you how I personally do it means 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.920
 We see here two elements at once. 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.130
 do first of all we put them on 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.130
 opposite side 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.339
 and raising we 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.339
 we make such a spoon 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.970
 looking for a second friend here first and here 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.580
 the second 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.710
 they are already at opposite places we 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.380
 weld them 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.170
 and just lift up with us 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.030
 formed center in the assembly of the first 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.960
 the center is nothing beyond wise 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.510
 of the year 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.790
 the second thing we do we are not 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.190
 turn over and opposite the white center 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.950
 Collect the yellow center here dvushka already 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:38.700
 worth looking for a second friend first element 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.550
 and now the second element we need 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:47.430
 save you see 1 2 we need them 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:49.680
 put on different facets match 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.050
 but it happens that they are matched 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.690
 so it is therefore necessary to remove 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.240
 here is this element put here 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.290
 and here it is easy to compare this one 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.000
 boyfriend 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.410
 here is a twin here here is 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.490
 the girl is here 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.290
 when we have a white center here assembled to us 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.259
 in no case can not be put like this 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.830
 because we have a white center collapses 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:17.160
 we have to put the items more precisely 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:21.600
 dvushki opposite friend do so 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:24.190
 raise remove lower yellow center 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.320
 in place white center in place 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.530
 further what i do i flip the cube 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:34.140
 in such a way and I am already collecting this 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:38.850
 grip see green green center 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:42.040
 collect see treshka treshka collected and 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:45.010
 with the last green here we have it 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.390
 what we do we always put green 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.390
 then from here 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.140
 and 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.080
 doing so was here I was not here 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:59.550
 he collected so we will be 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:03.570
 raised cleaned lowered I green 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:06.569
 further you need to also know learn 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:09.719
 coloring if you haven't 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.730
 can't distinguish colors 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:14.299
 you need to know the opposite 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.799
 white is always yellow opposite to green 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:20.579
 blue opposite red orange 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:23.310
 accordingly, respectively, if we have 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:27.359
 here green should be here 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.830
 the red garden is already red here except 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:30.900
 of this accordingly 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.160
 we are what we what we do we again 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.160
 here we put this red here 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.490
 he is already here this one 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:43.180
 assembled will be here and raise 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:45.610
 remove omit red in place 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.080
 green in place as we said before 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:52.710
 opposite the green going blue 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:57.160
 boyfriend blue here we remove it here to 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:59.380
 it was much more convenient for us and now 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.290
 we will deliver this orange right away 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:06.670
 here so that he does not interfere with us 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:13.660
 put here an orange 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:17.230
 collected the court raised there is such 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:21.010
 uncomplicated movements we collect all 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:23.860
 centers means once again making a reservation if u 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.410
 we have such a case yes when white 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.960
 need to put here what we do 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.320
 here we are doing what we are doing here 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.500
 here 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.120
 here it is not collected put here and here 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.540
 such uncomplicated movements 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.120
 we collect when we need just 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:45.940
 put my friend white here with it 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:52.500
 we have yellow collected we do not we do not 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:56.770
 that's how we put on one line 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:59.289
 raise two times lower 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.379
 Here, in principle, all go to the second 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:01.379
 parts
