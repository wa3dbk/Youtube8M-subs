00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.900 
studies are the main focus we're trying
to<00:02:09.110> feed<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.379> world<00:02:09.530> right<00:02:09.890> and<00:02:10.099> so<00:02:10.459> we<00:02:10.729> need

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
to feed the world right and so we need

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.910 
to feed the world right and so we need
to<00:02:11.000> do<00:02:11.120> better<00:02:11.150> at<00:02:11.629> how<00:02:11.750> how<00:02:12.530> we<00:02:12.590> do

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
to do better at how how we do

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.590 
to do better at how how we do
agriculture<00:02:13.340> so<00:02:13.640> that<00:02:13.760> we<00:02:13.820> can<00:02:13.970> continue<00:02:14.330> to

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
agriculture so that we can continue to

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.470 
agriculture so that we can continue to
improve<00:02:14.630> crop<00:02:15.590> yields<00:02:16.010> and<00:02:16.880> that<00:02:17.060> drives<00:02:17.330> us

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
improve crop yields and that drives us

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.100 
improve crop yields and that drives us
towards

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
towards

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.750 
towards

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
more and more technology ready for rain
