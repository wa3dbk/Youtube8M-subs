what<00:00:16.500> size<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:17.039> there<00:00:17.279> yeah<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.940> frames<00:00:18.300> will

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
what size is there yeah the frames will

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.980 
what size is there yeah the frames will
be<00:00:18.740> make<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.770> new<00:00:20.010> layer<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:21.510> makes<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.900> the

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
be make a new layer and it makes it the

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.470 
be make a new layer and it makes it the
same<00:00:22.230> size<00:00:22.560> as<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.310> image<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:24.029> have<00:00:24.240> at<00:00:24.359> the

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
the bottom that's the similar to the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.910 
the bottom that's the similar to the

them in the mid-1970s now because it's a

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.730 
them in the mid-1970s now because it's a
new<00:01:05.729> layer<00:01:06.000> it'll<00:01:06.510> have<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.659> transparency<00:01:07.560> in

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
new layer it'll have a transparency in

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.590 
new layer it'll have a transparency in
it<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.070> while<00:01:08.850> I've<00:01:08.970> got<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.150> set<00:01:09.450> of

it so while I've got the set of
selection<00:01:10.080> set<00:01:10.350> selected<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.460> hit<00:01:11.909> delete<00:01:12.119> key

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
selection set selected I hit delete key

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.070 
selection set selected I hit delete key
and<00:01:12.570> delete<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:13.670> now<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.729> select<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.780> outer

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
and delete it now I select the outer

and delete it now I select the outer
side<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.250> selection<00:01:18.920> now<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:19.979> go<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.250> edit

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
side of the selection now I go to edit

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.850 
side of the selection now I go to edit
and<00:01:21.290> a<00:01:22.290> copy<00:01:23.600> that<00:01:24.600> places<00:01:25.080> an<00:01:25.200> omelet<00:01:25.470> on<00:01:25.650> the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.850 
clipboard now go back to edit and I
paste<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.610> back<00:01:29.790> in<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.049> place<00:01:31.439> has<00:01:31.829> a

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
paste it back in and that place has a

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.370 
paste it back in and that place has a
floating<00:01:32.790> layer<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.600> make<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.049> complete

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
floating layer so I make it a complete

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.760 
floating layer so I make it a complete
layer<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:36.329> layer<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.900> now<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.229> exact

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
layer and that layer is now the exact

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.490 
layer and that layer is now the exact
size<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:39.150> frame<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.960> made<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.380> the

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
size of that frame I made of the

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.389 
size of that frame I made of the
Polaroid<00:01:41.009> camera<00:01:41.880> image<00:01:42.799> so<00:01:43.799> this<00:01:43.950> new<00:01:44.159> layer

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
Polaroid camera image so this new layer

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.789 
Polaroid camera image so this new layer
we<00:01:44.640> made<00:01:44.880> we<00:01:45.299> no<00:01:45.450> longer<00:01:45.479> require<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.380> as<00:01:46.530> far

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
we made we no longer require it as far

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.990 
we made we no longer require it as far
to<00:01:47.009> be<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:47.970> put<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.270> in<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.450> waste<00:01:48.659> bin<00:01:50.000> now

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
to be so I put it in the waste bin now

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.649 
to be so I put it in the waste bin now
that<00:01:51.149> we<00:01:51.240> have<00:01:51.420> our<00:01:51.920> frame<00:01:53.119> would<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.270> pick<00:01:54.479> 8

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
that we have our frame would you pick 8

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.820 
that we have our frame would you pick 8
this<00:01:54.810> 5<00:01:55.140> times

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
this 5 times

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.940 
this 5 times
and<00:01:57.820> you<00:01:58.060> can<00:01:58.240> you<00:01:58.600> can<00:01:58.890> duplicate<00:01:59.890> it

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
and you can you can duplicate it

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.070 
and you can you can duplicate it
yourself<00:02:00.490> depending<00:02:00.910> on<00:02:01.180> the<00:02:01.300> type<00:02:01.660> of<00:02:01.810> image

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
yourself depending on the type of image

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.530 
yourself depending on the type of image
you<00:02:02.230> got<00:02:02.440> now<00:02:03.430> we've<00:02:03.610> got<00:02:03.790> a<00:02:03.820> selector<00:02:04.420> that's

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
you got now we've got a selector that's

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.320 
you got now we've got a selector that's
the<00:02:04.720> top<00:02:04.930> one<00:02:05.140> I<00:02:05.290> got<00:02:05.530> them<00:02:05.680> on<00:02:05.770> those<00:02:05.980> to<00:02:06.330> make

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
the top one I got them on those to make

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.020 
the top one I got them on those to make
sure<00:02:07.600> you<00:02:07.840> have<00:02:08.050> this<00:02:08.320> radio<00:02:08.950> button<00:02:09.310> here

then<00:02:16.960> I<00:02:16.990> go<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.170> my<00:02:17.320> tilt<00:02:17.710> too<00:02:17.920> and<00:02:18.220> just<00:02:19.180> tilt

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
then I go to my tilt too and just tilt

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.970 
then I go to my tilt too and just tilt
it<00:02:19.540> a<00:02:19.720> little<00:02:20.910> turn<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.120> rotation<00:02:23.730> thank<00:02:24.730> you

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
it a little turn the rotation thank you

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.440 
it a little turn the rotation thank you
let's<00:02:26.980> place<00:02:27.280> that<00:02:27.310> image<00:02:27.790> into<00:02:27.970> that<00:02:28.090> one<00:02:28.270> I

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
let's place that image into that one I

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.420 
let's place that image into that one I
go<00:02:28.870> to<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.080> next<00:02:29.230> step<00:02:29.680> down<00:02:29.950> which<00:02:30.220> is<00:02:30.340> the

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
go to the next step down which is the

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.970 
go to the next step down which is the
other<00:02:30.580> layer<00:02:30.820> and<00:02:31.300> that's<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.750> layer<00:02:32.170> that<00:02:32.920> we

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
other layer and that's the layer that we

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.100 
other layer and that's the layer that we
will<00:02:33.250> count<00:02:33.370> I'll<00:02:33.520> be<00:02:33.640> working<00:02:34.060> with<00:02:34.090> I<00:02:34.510> go<00:02:35.050> to

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
will count I'll be working with I go to

will count I'll be working with I go to
my<00:02:35.290> move<00:02:35.470> tool<00:02:35.500> once<00:02:36.010> again<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:37.060> I<00:02:37.180> move<00:02:37.390> this

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
my move tool once again and I move this

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.120 
my move tool once again and I move this
one<00:02:37.600> over<00:02:38.050> to<00:02:38.080> these<00:02:38.380> other<00:02:38.620> groups<00:02:38.860> of<00:02:39.070> people

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
one over to these other groups of people

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.900 
one over to these other groups of people
over<00:02:39.940> here<00:02:40.860> you<00:02:41.860> can<00:02:42.010> see<00:02:42.220> why<00:02:42.400> now<00:02:42.640> it's

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
over here you can see why now it's

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.580 
over here you can see why now it's
important<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.600> have<00:02:43.750> this<00:02:43.930> radio<00:02:44.290> button

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
important to have this radio button

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.170 
important to have this radio button
active<00:02:45.190> because<00:02:45.550> we're<00:02:45.760> dropping<00:02:46.000> down

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
active because we're dropping down

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.420 
active because we're dropping down
through<00:02:46.600> the<00:02:47.200> layers<00:02:47.350> I<00:02:48.510> go<00:02:49.510> through<00:02:49.780> my

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
through the layers I go through my

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.850 
through the layers I go through my
rotation<00:02:51.430> tool<00:02:51.700> and<00:02:52.000> I<00:02:52.690> rotate<00:02:53.140> this<00:02:53.320> one<00:02:53.590> just

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
rotation tool and I rotate this one just

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.400 
rotation tool and I rotate this one just
a<00:02:53.950> fraction<00:02:54.400> just<00:02:54.580> to<00:02:54.820> give<00:02:54.970> it<00:02:55.000> a<00:02:55.150> random<00:02:55.690> look

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.640 

now<00:02:59.410> I<00:02:59.440> select<00:02:59.770> the<00:03:00.040> next<00:03:00.310> layer<00:03:01.380> return<00:03:02.380> to<00:03:02.500> my

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
now I select the next layer return to my

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.979 
now I select the next layer return to my
move<00:03:02.860> tool<00:03:02.890> and<00:03:03.370> then<00:03:04.180> move<00:03:04.209> it<00:03:04.570> to<00:03:04.600> something

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
move tool and then move it to something

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.449 
move tool and then move it to something
else<00:03:05.350> on<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:05.709> on<00:03:05.860> the<00:03:06.040> image<00:03:06.780> like<00:03:07.780> so<00:03:08.280> I'll<00:03:09.280> go

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
else on the on the image like so I'll go

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.680 
else on the on the image like so I'll go
to<00:03:09.489> my<00:03:10.920> rotation<00:03:11.920> tool<00:03:12.160> again<00:03:12.489> and<00:03:12.790> I<00:03:13.209> rotate

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
to my rotation tool again and I rotate

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.290 
to my rotation tool again and I rotate
it<00:03:13.720> just<00:03:13.900> a<00:03:14.290> slightly<00:03:14.680> off<00:03:15.030> opposite<00:03:16.030> of<00:03:16.180> what

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
it just a slightly off opposite of what

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.640 
it just a slightly off opposite of what
the<00:03:16.450> other<00:03:16.600> one<00:03:16.810> is<00:03:16.840> to<00:03:17.110> give<00:03:17.260> it<00:03:17.350> a<00:03:17.410> random

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
the other one is to give it a random

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.590 
the other one is to give it a random
effect<00:03:17.920> that<00:03:18.340> you're<00:03:18.550> not<00:03:18.670> all<00:03:18.910> laying<00:03:19.209> in<00:03:19.420> one

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
effect that you're not all laying in one

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.260 
effect that you're not all laying in one
line<00:03:20.430> now<00:03:21.430> I<00:03:21.459> move<00:03:21.700> down<00:03:22.030> to<00:03:22.270> the<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:23.350> next<00:03:23.590> one

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
line now I move down to the the next one

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.080 
line now I move down to the the next one
and<00:03:25.270> I<00:03:25.420> I<00:03:25.870> go<00:03:26.830> to<00:03:26.890> my<00:03:27.070> move<00:03:27.250> tool<00:03:27.550> and<00:03:27.700> of<00:03:27.910> course

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
and I I go to my move tool and of course

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.710 
and I I go to my move tool and of course
I'll<00:03:28.300> move<00:03:28.540> it<00:03:28.690> over<00:03:29.080> that<00:03:29.530> lamp<00:03:30.209> like<00:03:31.209> so<00:03:31.510> I

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
I'll move it over that lamp like so I

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.080 
I'll move it over that lamp like so I
won't<00:03:31.930> cover<00:03:32.140> the<00:03:32.320> bottom<00:03:32.590> image<00:03:32.860> and<00:03:33.610> so<00:03:33.910> I'll

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
won't cover the bottom image and so I'll

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.420 
won't cover the bottom image and so I'll
just<00:03:34.330> tilt<00:03:34.600> that<00:03:34.690> one<00:03:34.959> once<00:03:35.170> again<00:03:35.500> go<00:03:36.100> to<00:03:36.160> my

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
just tilt that one once again go to my

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.270 
just tilt that one once again go to my
rotation<00:03:37.030> tool<00:03:37.300> until<00:03:37.600> it<00:03:38.320> officer<00:03:38.950> towards

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
rotation tool until it officer towards

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.040 
rotation tool until it officer towards
the<00:03:39.400> other<00:03:39.520> one<00:03:39.730> is<00:03:39.880> there<00:03:40.120> not<00:03:40.270> too<00:03:40.540> much<00:03:40.750> and

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
the other one is there not too much and

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.150 
the other one is there not too much and
hit<00:03:41.890> rotate

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.860 

now<00:03:46.160> the<00:03:46.220> last<00:03:46.459> one<00:03:46.640> I'll<00:03:46.940> leave<00:03:47.120> as<00:03:47.330> is<00:03:47.540> that's

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
now the last one I'll leave as is that's

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.839 
now the last one I'll leave as is that's
the<00:03:48.020> one<00:03:48.170> there<00:03:48.410> now<00:03:49.190> you<00:03:49.250> could<00:03:49.400> see<00:03:49.610> all

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
the one there now you could see all

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:51.940 
the one there now you could see all
those<00:03:50.090> layers<00:03:50.420> are<00:03:50.810> now<00:03:51.080> that<00:03:51.349> size<00:03:51.650> that's

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
those layers are now that size that's

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.619 
those layers are now that size that's
why<00:03:52.129> it<00:03:52.190> was<00:03:52.370> easier<00:03:52.790> to<00:03:52.819> work<00:03:53.090> with

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:53.629 
why it was easier to work with

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:56.680 
why it was easier to work with
now<00:03:54.260> I<00:03:54.349> come<00:03:54.590> down<00:03:54.800> here<00:03:54.830> and<00:03:55.250> I<00:03:55.910> turn<00:03:56.180> this<00:03:56.360> off

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
now I come down here and I turn this off

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:04.990 
now I come down here and I turn this off
I<00:04:00.220> return<00:04:01.220> to<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:01.550> top<00:04:03.069> and<00:04:04.069> I<00:04:04.519> right-click

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
I return to the top and I right-click

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.070 
I return to the top and I right-click
the<00:04:05.150> top<00:04:05.360> layer<00:04:05.569> and<00:04:06.220> select<00:04:07.220> merge<00:04:07.310> visible

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
the top layer and select merge visible

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.839 
the top layer and select merge visible
images<00:04:09.080> that's<00:04:09.680> the<00:04:09.920> reason<00:04:10.250> I<00:04:10.370> turned<00:04:10.670> the

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
images that's the reason I turned the

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.750 
images that's the reason I turned the
eye<00:04:10.880> off<00:04:11.269> on<00:04:11.540> me<00:04:11.890> on<00:04:12.890> the<00:04:13.010> background<00:04:13.580> layer

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
eye off on me on the background layer

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.509 
eye off on me on the background layer
which<00:04:14.000> is<00:04:14.239> our<00:04:14.420> image<00:04:14.780> now<00:04:15.049> I'll<00:04:15.980> merge<00:04:16.639> the

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
which is our image now I'll merge the

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.759 
which is our image now I'll merge the
though<00:04:19.519> all<00:04:19.729> the<00:04:19.880> layers<00:04:20.090> together<00:04:20.739> now<00:04:21.739> I

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
though all the layers together now I

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.020 
though all the layers together now I
switch<00:04:22.070> the<00:04:22.280> eye<00:04:22.310> back<00:04:22.700> on<00:04:24.729> now<00:04:25.729> you<00:04:25.850> can<00:04:26.000> see

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
switch the eye back on now you can see

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.180 
switch the eye back on now you can see
there's<00:04:26.600> a<00:04:26.690> dotted<00:04:26.900> line<00:04:27.050> all<00:04:27.530> around<00:04:27.770> there

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
there's a dotted line all around there

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.670 
there's a dotted line all around there
that's<00:04:28.490> the<00:04:28.760> size<00:04:29.030> of<00:04:29.360> all<00:04:29.630> where<00:04:30.470> those

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
that's the size of all where those

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.350 
that's the size of all where those
cutouts<00:04:31.190> were<00:04:31.370> place<00:04:31.639> and<00:04:31.970> there<00:04:32.090> were<00:04:32.210> the

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
cutouts were place and there were the

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.230 
cutouts were place and there were the
layers<00:04:32.570> said<00:04:33.320> the<00:04:33.919> layer<00:04:34.160> dialog<00:04:34.639> is<00:04:34.910> made<00:04:35.210> a

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
layers said the layer dialog is made a

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.930 
layers said the layer dialog is made a
layer<00:04:35.570> or<00:04:36.080> in<00:04:36.380> that<00:04:36.530> fashion<00:04:36.800> so<00:04:37.460> we<00:04:37.639> need<00:04:37.820> to

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
layer or in that fashion so we need to

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.940 
layer or in that fashion so we need to
make<00:04:38.120> it<00:04:38.270> the<00:04:38.389> full<00:04:38.630> size<00:04:39.110> of<00:04:39.350> the<00:04:39.470> image<00:04:39.800> in

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
make it the full size of the image in

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.940 
make it the full size of the image in
the<00:04:40.040> background<00:04:40.090> so<00:04:41.090> we<00:04:41.240> right<00:04:41.840> click<00:04:41.870> on<00:04:42.290> on

the background so we right click on on

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.090 
the background so we right click on on
the<00:04:43.160> top<00:04:43.370> layer<00:04:43.610> and<00:04:43.880> go<00:04:43.970> to<00:04:44.570> later<00:04:45.290> image<00:04:45.800> size

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.629 
the top layer and go to later image size
and<00:04:46.810> that's<00:04:47.810> moved<00:04:48.200> all<00:04:48.500> that<00:04:48.639> mangement

and that's moved all that mangement

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:52.990 
and that's moved all that mangement
