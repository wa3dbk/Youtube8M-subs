00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.639
 and to everyone vigorous in the evening there is such 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:13.290
 wonderful tablet oysters t7 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:16.410
 in 3g and I must say his apples in 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.449
 now a little backstory when his 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.949
 Acquired in MTS and I was offered here 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.260
 immediately unlock but for a certain 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.560
 the amount and what actually refused after 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.250
 this raised a topic on ford and now 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.269
 here it is right today a little 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.570
 instructions on how you can 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.430
 unlock sleep or try 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.239
 work not work on interest for the sake of 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.910
 tried 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.730
 but at the moment I have unblocked it 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.780
 works as a company motive network we have 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.260
 such a mobile operator with Oryol 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.170
 areas 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:54.170
 And actually manual choosing interest for the sake of 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.170
 is provided 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.910
 after what they say is not 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.650
 much so the work of cement is this I 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.479
 almost never used so he forever 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.320
 I cut is therefore now us 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.320
 actually about 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.259
 but let's say we choose the motive 2g itself 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.729
 online registration completed 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:28.079
 it is necessary on the SIM card just do not have no limit 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.960
 network so the internet and not connecting 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:33.509
 Well, over time, this will decide after 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.250
 how did i unlock me randomly 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.750
 it turned out that as a matter of fact in 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.399
 instructions are described from the second slot 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.890
 unblocked do not know hanging on need 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:46.549
 study 2 it needs to start from the first 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.549
 I just made a mistake and turn off to start 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:03.360
 so perhaps I will disconnect charging 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.650
 he turned on and before the horse simpler current 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.330
 that is, it turns out to be distant 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.040
 second slot though i thought you were first 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.770
 were how now rejoice can be 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.370
 numbering error where it says yes 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.500
 sim1 and drawn on top 72 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.840
 but actually confused means 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.400
 it turns out the top is the first slot though 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:29.450
 He is not signed that 2 insert sim 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.450
 club angles motives life shabby 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.920
 turn on the device 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.580
 so now he writes that the network was not found 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.390
 that is, the device is still possible 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.420
 to use 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.420
 in both seconds he when she goes network 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:27.320
 it will naturally be blocked so 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.320
 network is looking for 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:41.450
 locked and to unlock from below 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.550
 there is a search button bulo through it i 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.880
 actually went to the main menu 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.320
 there is if you dial the engineering code here 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:52.070
 asterisk clearly asterisk lattice 30 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:55.610
 564 6630 and the sprocket sprocket 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:58.160
 an asterisk from a fight let's say no 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:03.100
 like no it's you and 1 and bottom below 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.100
 google button click search 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.600
 thereafter 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.700
 aha nothing happens now 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.510
 I need to remember where I clicked well 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.510
 let's search 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:25.180
 so we press ok more he writes that 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:28.630
 find the motive and all that and close the search 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.630
 google search 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.470
 I do not know need to do this mandatory 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:41.150
 okay or not after this home and this 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:50.770
 unlocked push the phone enter 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:56.840
 code asterisk lattice 634 more often 66 now 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:58.180
 I am clearly atrociously clear asterisk zero 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:11.870
 of emotions 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:12.950
 joke joke 3646 6-3 try 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.920
 sprocket 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:20.930
 grille asterisk grille and nothing and 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:24.500
 joke atrocious asterisk yes 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:29.060
 the second time he worked as a mod engineer 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:39.520
 choose now what the hell is here 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:39.520
 recommends a taxi could give him a sim1 forehead 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.210
 nationalization and that's actually unlock 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.930
 I tried it I did not unlock too 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.710
 same standard code that is how you 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:57.080
 see the attempts were unsuccessful left 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:05.270
 three attempts try the standard code from 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:08.360
 1 to 8 4 5 6 7 8 below there in the instructions 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:11.720
 specified either from 1 to 8 or from 1 to 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.710
 9 2 cars 8 cards and unlock by tilt 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.790
 from 1 to 9 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:19.150
 and so finish look at the result 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.150
 unlocks action
