never given before which is to be a

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.900 
never given before which is to be a
little<00:00:39.870> bit<00:00:39.960> more<00:00:40.079> open<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:41.250> be<00:00:41.370> able<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.700> talk

little bit more open to be able to talk
about<00:00:42.030> things<00:00:42.300> that<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.510> wouldn't<00:00:42.570> even<00:00:42.960> talk

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230

about things that I wouldn't even talk
to<00:00:43.260> my<00:00:43.440> mum<00:00:43.620> about<00:00:44.210> that<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.239> chose<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.660> talk<00:00:45.780> to

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
to my mum about that I chose to talk to

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:54.229 
to my mum about that I chose to talk to
you<00:00:46.079> guys<00:00:46.260> about<00:00:51.710> it's<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.770> really<00:00:53.250> hard

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
you guys about it's a really hard

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.790 
you guys about it's a really hard
question<00:00:54.690> because<00:00:57.469> everything<00:00:58.469> was<00:00:58.559> someone

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
question because everything was someone

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.349 
question because everything was someone
the<00:00:58.890> album<00:00:59.070> has<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.219> different<00:00:59.520> meaning<00:00:59.699> but<00:01:00.300> I

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
the album has a different meaning but I

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.799 
the album has a different meaning but I
probably<00:01:00.840> say<00:01:01.320> what<00:01:02.190> money<00:01:02.370> can't<00:01:02.640> buy

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
probably say what money can't buy

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.670 
probably say what money can't buy
because<00:01:03.809> it's<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:03.989> only<00:01:04.110> ballad<00:01:04.470> on<00:01:04.589> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
because it's the only ballad on the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.500 
because it's the only ballad on the
album<00:01:04.979> also<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.760> song<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.270> co-wrote

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
album also is a song that I co-wrote

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.840 
album also is a song that I co-wrote
when<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.840> was<00:01:06.990> 18<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:08.150> I<00:01:09.150> had<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:10.520> revoke<00:01:11.520> Aliyah

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
when I was 18 and I had to revoke Aliyah

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.300 
when I was 18 and I had to revoke Aliyah
and<00:01:12.500> because<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.619> was<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:13.830> emotional<00:01:14.010> I

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
and because it was so emotional I

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.950 
and because it was so emotional I
couldn't<00:01:14.700> revoking<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.299> like<00:01:15.540> I'd<00:01:15.659> done<00:01:15.780> it

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
couldn't revoking it like I'd done it

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.469 
couldn't revoking it like I'd done it
like<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.590> think<00:01:17.460> I'd<00:01:17.549> be<00:01:17.610> vocal<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:18.000> about<00:01:18.180> four

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
like I think I'd be vocal to about four

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.940 
like I think I'd be vocal to about four
times<00:01:18.720> because<00:01:19.049> every<00:01:19.320> time<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.560> went<00:01:19.710> into<00:01:19.830> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
times because every time I went into the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.320 
times because every time I went into the
studio<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.280> do<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.520> I'd<00:01:20.640> get<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.000> second

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
studio to do it I'd get to the second

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.179 
studio to do it I'd get to the second
verse<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.479> I'd<00:01:21.750> be<00:01:21.840> like<00:01:21.960> like<00:01:22.110> or<00:01:22.320> don't<00:01:23.009> do

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
verse and I'd be like like or don't do

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.830 
verse and I'd be like like or don't do
it<00:01:23.250> anymore<00:01:23.430> I'm<00:01:24.150> not<00:01:24.210> sure<00:01:24.390> if<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.540> went<00:01:24.689> on<00:01:24.720> the

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
it anymore I'm not sure if I went on the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.810 
it anymore I'm not sure if I went on the
album<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.380> stopped<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.520> took<00:01:26.729> me<00:01:26.880> about

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
album and I stopped so it took me about

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.100 
album and I stopped so it took me about
about<00:01:29.820> five<00:01:30.030> months<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.420> just<00:01:30.540> do<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.900> one

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
about five months to just do that one

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.719 
about five months to just do that one
song<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.710> actually<00:01:31.950> get<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.189> perfected

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
song to actually get it perfected

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.609 
song to actually get it perfected
because<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.360> how<00:01:33.479> emotional<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.439> I

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
because of how emotional it is and I

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.200 
because of how emotional it is and I
would<00:01:34.770> say<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.100> enjoyed<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.640> because<00:01:35.909> for<00:01:36.030> me

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
would say I enjoyed it because for me

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.240

look<00:01:52.110> someone's<00:01:52.890> gonna<00:01:52.950> hear<00:01:53.159> something<00:01:53.549> I

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
look someone's gonna hear something I

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.969 
look someone's gonna hear something I
don't<00:01:53.700> have<00:01:54.119> 18<00:01:54.509> so<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.380> think<00:01:55.530> it'd<00:01:55.860> probably

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
don't have 18 so I think it'd probably

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:08.630 
don't have 18 so I think it'd probably
be<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.340> song

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
performance so I never remember a

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.810 
performance so I never remember a
performance<00:03:17.620> I<00:03:17.680> done<00:03:17.860> two<00:03:18.280> weeks<00:03:18.430> ago<00:03:18.640> that

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
performance I done two weeks ago that

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:19.440 
performance I done two weeks ago that
felt<00:03:19.180> great

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
felt great

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.710 
felt great
I<00:03:19.540> remember<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:19.959> one<00:03:20.110> I<00:03:20.140> just<00:03:20.260> done<00:03:21.070> and<00:03:21.720> doing

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
I remember the one I just done and doing

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.160 
I remember the one I just done and doing
that<00:03:22.840> video<00:03:22.930> I<00:03:23.440> didn't<00:03:24.220> think<00:03:24.340> it<00:03:24.580> was<00:03:25.170> didn't

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
that video I didn't think it was didn't

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:34.050 
that video I didn't think it was didn't
think<00:03:26.290> it<00:03:26.350> was<00:03:26.410> good<00:03:26.590> enough<00:03:26.739> for<00:03:26.920> you<00:03:29.070> I<00:03:33.060> guess

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
think it was good enough for you I guess

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.140 
think it was good enough for you I guess
it<00:03:34.330> differs<00:03:34.540> because<00:03:35.370> with<00:03:36.370> your<00:03:36.549> first<00:03:36.880> album

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
it differs because with your first album

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.210 
it differs because with your first album
coming<00:03:37.660> from<00:03:37.840> the<00:03:38.140> x-factor<00:03:38.530> you<00:03:38.830> kind<00:03:39.100> of

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
coming from the x-factor you kind of

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.789 
coming from the x-factor you kind of
have<00:03:39.430> to<00:03:39.459> reenact<00:03:40.330> being<00:03:40.690> the<00:03:40.900> winner<00:03:41.049> but

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
have to reenact being the winner but

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.500 
have to reenact being the winner but
with<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.160> second<00:03:42.700> album<00:03:42.940> you<00:03:43.030> really<00:03:43.330> come

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
with the second album you really come

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.270 
with the second album you really come
into<00:03:43.690> your<00:03:43.780> own<00:03:43.840> I<00:03:44.230> mean<00:03:44.560> as<00:03:44.680> an<00:03:44.769> artist<00:03:45.040> I<00:03:45.100> felt

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
into your own I mean as an artist I felt

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.830 
into your own I mean as an artist I felt
like<00:03:45.370> I<00:03:45.459> came<00:03:45.519> into<00:03:45.820> my<00:03:46.000> own<00:03:46.150> into<00:03:46.480> where<00:03:46.660> I

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
like I came into my own into where I

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.070

felt<00:03:47.200> like<00:03:47.290> I<00:03:47.850> was<00:03:48.850> brave<00:03:49.450> enough<00:03:49.480> to<00:03:49.780> take

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
felt like I was brave enough to take

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.979 
felt like I was brave enough to take
some<00:03:50.260> risks<00:03:50.680> and<00:03:51.540> although<00:03:52.540> I<00:03:52.690> keep

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
some risks and although I keep

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.180 
some risks and although I keep
questioning<00:03:53.140> myself<00:03:53.500> and<00:03:53.799> going<00:03:53.920> to<00:03:54.040> myself

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
questioning myself and going to myself

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.220 
questioning myself and going to myself
each<00:03:54.670> and<00:03:54.880> every<00:03:55.000> single<00:03:55.150> day<00:03:55.390> because<00:03:55.959> it's

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
each and every single day because it's

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.960 
each and every single day because it's
leading<00:03:56.470> up<00:03:56.560> to<00:03:56.590> it<00:03:56.739> being<00:03:56.890> out<00:03:57.100> I<00:03:57.340> keep<00:03:57.730> saying

leading up to it being out I keep saying

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:58.380 
leading up to it being out I keep saying

it I literally was sleeping in a studio

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.690 
it I literally was sleeping in a studio
for<00:04:16.590> like<00:04:16.680> two<00:04:16.890> weeks<00:04:17.130> because<00:04:17.280> I<00:04:17.459> wouldn't

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
for like two weeks because I wouldn't
