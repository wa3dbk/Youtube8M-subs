Smurfette's<00:02:44.120> hair<00:02:44.390> was<00:02:44.569> most<00:02:44.870> challenging

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
Smurfette's hair was most challenging

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.840 
Smurfette's hair was most challenging
because<00:02:45.560> of<00:02:45.800> the<00:02:45.860> large<00:02:46.100> silhouette<00:02:46.640> an

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
because of the large silhouette an

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.240 
because of the large silhouette an
implied<00:02:47.300> amount<00:02:47.720> of<00:02:47.810> hair<00:02:48.019> spray<00:02:48.380> necessary

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
implied amount of hair spray necessary

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.370 
implied amount of hair spray necessary
to<00:02:49.430> hold<00:02:49.700> real<00:02:50.090> hair<00:02:50.390> in<00:02:50.780> that<00:02:51.050> shape

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
to hold real hair in that shape

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.830 
to hold real hair in that shape
ultimately<00:02:52.340> we<00:02:52.730> loosen<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.180> stiffness<00:02:53.630> to

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
ultimately we loosen the stiffness to

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.809 
ultimately we loosen the stiffness to
get<00:02:53.989> a<00:02:54.019> more<00:02:54.290> relaxed<00:02:54.830> and<00:02:55.040> natural<00:02:55.160> movement

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
get a more relaxed and natural movement

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.000 
get a more relaxed and natural movement
each<00:02:56.810> character<00:02:57.319> goes<00:02:57.530> through<00:02:57.560> some

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
each character goes through some

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.590 
each character goes through some
lighting<00:02:58.250> checks<00:02:58.610> to<00:02:58.850> see<00:02:59.030> that<00:02:59.180> everything

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
lighting checks to see that everything

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.230 
lighting checks to see that everything
is<00:02:59.690> working<00:02:59.750> properly

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.510 

it<00:03:05.840> took<00:03:06.020> the<00:03:06.200> image<00:03:06.380> work<00:03:06.560> screw<00:03:06.890> a<00:03:06.920> few<00:03:07.250> shots

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
it took the image work screw a few shots

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.550 
it took the image work screw a few shots
with<00:03:07.760> each<00:03:08.030> character<00:03:08.300> to<00:03:08.750> get<00:03:09.050> the<00:03:09.200> basic

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
with each character to get the basic

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:17.070 
with each character to get the basic
look<00:03:09.740> right

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.660
