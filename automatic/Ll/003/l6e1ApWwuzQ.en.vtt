act 2 on my Gears of War 3 insane
difficulty<00:00:23.300> video<00:00:23.660> walkthrough<00:00:24.140> and<00:00:24.380> this<00:00:24.710> is

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:24.860 
difficulty video walkthrough and this is

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.139 
difficulty video walkthrough and this is
touchdown<00:00:25.340> chapter<00:00:26.119> 7<00:00:27.369> so<00:00:28.369> this<00:00:28.700> is<00:00:28.880> actually

00:00:29.139 --> 00:00:29.149 
touchdown chapter 7 so this is actually

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:31.420 
touchdown chapter 7 so this is actually
probably<00:00:29.329> the<00:00:29.689> shortest<00:00:30.560> chapter<00:00:31.220> of<00:00:31.310> the

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
probably the shortest chapter of the

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.220 
probably the shortest chapter of the
game<00:00:31.579> but<00:00:32.509> it<00:00:32.720> can<00:00:32.930> be<00:00:33.020> quite<00:00:33.200> challenging

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
game but it can be quite challenging

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.900 
game but it can be quite challenging
because<00:00:33.739> you<00:00:33.920> have<00:00:34.010> to<00:00:34.220> take<00:00:34.370> down<00:00:34.460> a<00:00:34.520> bunch<00:00:34.790> of

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
because you have to take down a bunch of

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.460 
because you have to take down a bunch of
the<00:00:34.970> barges<00:00:35.390> and<00:00:35.510> the<00:00:35.570> barges<00:00:35.870> will<00:00:36.079> shoot<00:00:36.320> it

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470 
the barges and the barges will shoot it

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.700 
the barges and the barges will shoot it
here<00:00:36.649> and<00:00:37.270> also<00:00:38.270> a<00:00:38.750> bunch<00:00:39.110> of<00:00:39.230> rivers<00:00:39.559> will

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
here and also a bunch of rivers will

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.250 
here and also a bunch of rivers will
turn<00:00:39.890> up<00:00:40.070> and<00:00:40.220> they'll<00:00:40.340> shoot<00:00:40.489> at<00:00:40.640> you<00:00:40.730> too<00:00:41.260> if

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
turn up and they'll shoot at you too if

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.650 
turn up and they'll shoot at you too if
you're<00:00:42.410> not<00:00:42.500> careful<00:00:42.679> you<00:00:42.920> will<00:00:43.160> die<00:00:43.399> but<00:00:44.179> it's

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
you're not careful you will die but it's

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.119 
you're not careful you will die but it's
nowhere<00:00:44.929> near<00:00:45.050> as<00:00:45.199> challenging<00:00:45.769> as<00:00:45.859> some<00:00:46.039> of

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
nowhere near as challenging as some of

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:47.380 
nowhere near as challenging as some of
the<00:00:46.190> other<00:00:46.340> parts<00:00:46.579> of<00:00:46.670> insane<00:00:47.000> so<00:00:47.329> you

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
the other parts of insane so you

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.819 
the other parts of insane so you
shouldn't<00:00:47.839> you<00:00:48.199> know<00:00:48.289> it<00:00:48.410> shouldn't<00:00:48.649> be<00:00:48.710> too

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
shouldn't you know it shouldn't be too

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.040 
shouldn't you know it shouldn't be too
difficult<00:00:48.859> don't<00:00:49.519> don't<00:00:50.420> ask<00:00:50.510> me<00:00:50.690> why<00:00:50.780> I<00:00:50.809> tried

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
difficult don't don't ask me why I tried

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.240 
difficult don't don't ask me why I tried
to<00:00:51.079> shoot<00:00:51.289> you<00:00:51.410> with<00:00:51.530> a<00:00:51.559> sniper<00:00:51.710> rifle<00:00:52.070> I<00:00:52.100> just

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
to shoot you with a sniper rifle I just

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.860 
to shoot you with a sniper rifle I just
got<00:00:52.339> a<00:00:52.370> bit<00:00:52.519> ambitious<00:00:52.820> instead<00:00:53.329> of<00:00:53.420> reloading

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
got a bit ambitious instead of reloading

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.610 
got a bit ambitious instead of reloading
this<00:00:54.019> thing<00:00:54.230> but<00:00:55.899> the<00:00:56.899> trick<00:00:57.109> to<00:00:57.140> this<00:00:57.320> is<00:00:57.379> is

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
this thing but the trick to this is is

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.079 
this thing but the trick to this is is
getting<00:00:57.859> your<00:00:58.039> shots<00:00:58.280> to<00:00:58.460> count<00:00:58.699> if<00:00:58.999> you're

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
getting your shots to count if you're

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:00.970 
getting your shots to count if you're
missing<00:00:59.449> with<00:00:59.570> the<00:00:59.690> Boomers<00:01:00.109> you're<00:01:00.800> going<00:01:00.920> to

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
missing with the Boomers you're going to

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.950 
missing with the Boomers you're going to
be<00:01:01.070> in<00:01:01.159> more<00:01:01.309> trouble<00:01:01.370> and<00:01:02.059> it<00:01:02.210> can<00:01:02.449> be

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
be in more trouble and it can be

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.299 
be in more trouble and it can be
difficult<00:01:03.469> to<00:01:03.499> hit<00:01:03.649> them<00:01:03.800> sometimes<00:01:04.129> when

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
difficult to hit them sometimes when

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:05.620 
difficult to hit them sometimes when
you're<00:01:04.430> moving<00:01:04.519> there<00:01:04.940> the<00:01:05.120> Reavers<00:01:05.480> are

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
you're moving there the Reavers are

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.899 
you're moving there the Reavers are
harder<00:01:05.930> to<00:01:05.960> hit<00:01:06.230> but<00:01:06.710> they<00:01:06.830> have<00:01:06.980> this<00:01:07.130> really

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
harder to hit but they have this really

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:09.790 
harder to hit but they have this really
really<00:01:08.090> you<00:01:08.390> know<00:01:08.510> useful<00:01:08.780> hobby<00:01:09.350> to<00:01:09.500> flying

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
really you know useful hobby to flying

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.960 
really you know useful hobby to flying
in<00:01:09.920> front<00:01:10.130> of<00:01:10.250> your<00:01:10.400> barrel<00:01:10.670> when<00:01:10.850> you're

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
in front of your barrel when you're

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.910 
in front of your barrel when you're
shooting<00:01:11.090> at<00:01:11.330> the<00:01:11.420> barges<00:01:11.810> so<00:01:12.110> if<00:01:12.590> you<00:01:12.710> start

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
shooting at the barges so if you start

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.130 
shooting at the barges so if you start
taking<00:01:13.070> damage<00:01:13.400> on<00:01:13.700> the<00:01:13.790> turret<00:01:14.090> try<00:01:14.899> and<00:01:15.020> get

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
taking damage on the turret try and get

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.639 
taking damage on the turret try and get
to<00:01:15.229> cover<00:01:15.439> I<00:01:15.530> mean<00:01:15.710> look<00:01:15.860> at<00:01:15.920> that<00:01:16.570> I<00:01:17.570> was<00:01:18.470> just

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
to cover I mean look at that I was just

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:19.660 
to cover I mean look at that I was just
holding<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:18.950> trigger<00:01:19.159> then<00:01:19.310> and<00:01:19.460> swinging

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
holding the trigger then and swinging

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.280 
holding the trigger then and swinging
the<00:01:19.850> amur<00:01:20.030> towards<00:01:20.420> the<00:01:20.630> barge<00:01:20.810> and<00:01:21.020> I<00:01:21.049> managed

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
the amur towards the barge and I managed

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.139 
the amur towards the barge and I managed
to<00:01:21.409> hit<00:01:21.560> it<00:01:21.740> so<00:01:21.950> luckily<00:01:22.310> enough<00:01:22.520> you<00:01:22.640> you<00:01:22.939> can

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
to hit it so luckily enough you you can

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.240 
to hit it so luckily enough you you can
look<00:01:23.329> out<00:01:23.540> on<00:01:23.689> some<00:01:23.869> shots<00:01:24.110> this<00:01:24.649> is<00:01:24.860> a<00:01:24.890> really

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
look out on some shots this is a really

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.499 
look out on some shots this is a really
tough<00:01:25.399> shot<00:01:25.640> to<00:01:25.759> hit<00:01:25.880> that<00:01:25.969> barge<00:01:26.210> at<00:01:26.390> that

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
tough shot to hit that barge at that

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:27.670 
tough shot to hit that barge at that
distance<00:01:26.689> you<00:01:26.930> want<00:01:27.079> to<00:01:27.140> wait<00:01:27.229> for<00:01:27.380> it<00:01:27.439> to<00:01:27.530> come

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
distance you want to wait for it to come

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.649 
distance you want to wait for it to come
closer<00:01:29.439> so<00:01:30.549> prioritize<00:01:31.549> the<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:32.090> siege

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
closer so prioritize the the siege

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.690 
closer so prioritize the the siege
barges<00:01:33.170> over<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:33.710> Reavers<00:01:34.040> if<00:01:34.189> you<00:01:34.280> can<00:01:34.490> as

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
barges over the Reavers if you can as

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.370 
barges over the Reavers if you can as
soon<00:01:34.850> as<00:01:34.939> you<00:01:35.000> kill<00:01:35.149> the<00:01:35.390> barges<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:36.110> level

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
soon as you kill the barges the level

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.410 
soon as you kill the barges the level
pretty<00:01:36.619> much<00:01:36.770> ends<00:01:37.189> and<00:01:37.369> you<00:01:37.790> can<00:01:37.939> hide<00:01:38.180> from

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
pretty much ends and you can hide from

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.410 
pretty much ends and you can hide from
the<00:01:38.659> reasons<00:01:39.170> for<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:39.350> rest<00:01:39.530> of<00:01:39.680> it<00:01:40.270> it's<00:01:41.270> not

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
the reasons for the rest of it it's not

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.459 
the reasons for the rest of it it's not

cool<00:03:24.419> with<00:03:24.689> the<00:03:24.810> fire<00:03:24.989> on<00:03:25.139> the<00:03:25.199> screen

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:25.699 
cool with the fire on the screen

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:27.619 
cool with the fire on the screen
especially<00:03:26.699> when<00:03:26.819> you<00:03:26.879> consider<00:03:27.000> how<00:03:27.329> shit

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
especially when you consider how shit

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:28.969 
especially when you consider how shit
the<00:03:27.720> fire<00:03:27.930> looked<00:03:28.169> on<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.379> second<00:03:28.739> one<00:03:28.829> when

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:28.979 
the fire looked on the second one when

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:29.839 
the fire looked on the second one when
you<00:03:29.069> just<00:03:29.220> got<00:03:29.310> those<00:03:29.400> little<00:03:29.669> bloody

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
you just got those little bloody

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:33.170 
you just got those little bloody
firecrackers<00:03:30.509> a<00:03:30.540> bomb<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:31.430> then<00:03:32.430> I<00:03:32.879> think

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
firecrackers a bomb and then I think

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.909 
firecrackers a bomb and then I think
once<00:03:33.389> she<00:03:33.509> does<00:03:33.599> it<00:03:33.720> enough<00:03:33.810> times<00:03:34.199> it<00:03:34.620> ends<00:03:34.799> a

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:34.919 
once she does it enough times it ends a

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:37.420 
once she does it enough times it ends a
level<00:03:35.220> so<00:03:36.030> there<00:03:36.180> you<00:03:36.239> go<00:03:36.419> that's<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:36.989> end<00:03:37.109> of

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
level so there you go that's the end of

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.710 
level so there you go that's the end of
