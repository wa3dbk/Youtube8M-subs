00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
two weeks in bottle fed him through the

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.530 
two weeks in bottle fed him through the
night<00:00:40.800> we<00:00:41.460> also<00:00:41.610> thought<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.149> he<00:00:42.210> might<00:00:42.390> be

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.850 
night we also thought that he might be
blind<00:00:42.780> because<00:00:43.200> his<00:00:43.350> eyes<00:00:43.500> were<00:00:43.530> really

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
blind because his eyes were really

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.500 
blind because his eyes were really
underdeveloped<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:45.030> we<00:00:45.120> had<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.270> lot<00:00:45.480> of

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
underdeveloped so we had a lot of

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.260 
underdeveloped so we had a lot of
treatment<00:00:46.160> antibiotics<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.460> was<00:00:47.969> put<00:00:48.180> on

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
treatment antibiotics and was put on

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.630 
treatment antibiotics and was put on
eyedrops<00:00:48.860> when<00:00:49.860> he<00:00:49.950> was<00:00:50.039> about<00:00:50.160> four<00:00:50.430> weeks

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
eyedrops when he was about four weeks

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.020 
eyedrops when he was about four weeks

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
I've got three other dogs they were all

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.510 
I've got three other dogs they were all
suffering<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:07.020> little<00:01:07.140> bit<00:01:07.320> missing<00:01:08.040> him<00:01:08.250> and

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
suffering a little bit missing him and

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.460 
suffering a little bit missing him and
I've<00:01:08.610> seen<00:01:08.820> my<00:01:09.270> burn<00:01:09.510> my<00:01:09.750> sister<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.200> me<00:01:10.320> were

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
also missing him so we really thought

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.359 
also missing him so we really thought
that<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.170> would<00:01:13.260> be<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> nice<00:01:13.560> opportunity<00:01:13.710> to

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
that it would be a nice opportunity to

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.520 
that it would be a nice opportunity to
do<00:01:14.549> something<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.030> take<00:01:15.210> our<00:01:15.420> mind<00:01:15.630> off<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
do something to take our mind off it the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.890 
do something to take our mind off it the
Smithee<00:01:16.920> might<00:01:17.100> give<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.430> bit<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.820> something<00:01:18.780> to

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
Smithee might give a bit of something to

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.140
