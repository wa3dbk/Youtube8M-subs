 Hello everyone, I am Jelena Sudakova 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.990
 and today I learned how to make tattoos 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.929
 to their pupae home from that 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.179
 that you have such a cool summer 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.190
 weather and body as open as possible 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.199
 review for this master class to me 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.320
 I needed a doll this time for me 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.289
 help revan translations sure that 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.500
 almost everyone somewhere is not lying around 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.590
 scissors 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.940
 some water in just one stick 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.710
 cotton pad only brush 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.230
 any transparent fixative is better 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.809
 Of course, matt and acetone 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.579
 case we go through our translations and look for 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.340
 most suitable for your baby doll 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.200
 carefully cut out with scissors check 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.360
 not a big ole bulle tattoo for a place on 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.969
 which we want to put him take 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.860
 cotton pad and dunk water more 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.870
 water and the better the effect 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.570
 Freshly put a wet sheet on the tattoo and 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.850
 press your fingers for a couple of seconds now 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.750
 also sharply pulls back a hand with cotton and 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.100
 date paper to lubricate nothing 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.140
 if so then did not like al-isles 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.110
 wet a cotton swab in acetone 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.140
 and gently erase the date of the wala everything is clean 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.659
 you can repeat the procedure never 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.380
 never keep acetone near 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.479
 doll head 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.790
 one drop on mine and the result will be 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.340
 deplorable liked soot 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.259
 I think you hardly want her to become 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.040
 time flexible and clung to the dust 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.610
 solacing 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.530
 I, too, so we dunk any brush 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.000
 transparent fixative and apply it 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.369
 neatly shaped tattoo 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.350
 when everything dries the doll it will be possible 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.450
 touch as before and on her body will 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.490
 such a picture which no longer have 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.500
 whom 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.930
 I hope my lesson helped you with you I was 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.340
 Elena Sudakova and you join your 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.750

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.750
