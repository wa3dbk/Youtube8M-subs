00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:08.139
 the materials that we will use today are 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:12.000
 jewelery stones lace of fruits 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:16.980
 extra crochet hooks 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.140
 and rings artisan silicone forceps 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.140
 liquid and fabric 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.360
 The first thing we are going to do is take 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.510
 our little piece of cloth that in this 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.970
 case is a silk we are going to place it 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.810
 the bright part back and we're going to 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:37.680
 start hitting the stones 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:40.410
 on top of the fabric for this is necessary 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.780
 that the pebbles are flat we are going to 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.880
 take the silicone apply and paste 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.540
 on the fabric leaving a space 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.540
 around 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.610
 let's go now then to take the first 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.410
 cord with which we will work that 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.650
 is this cord that is like a color 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.530
 lavender the idea is that the cord should 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.440
 be flat you can also get 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.160
 like rat tail or like cord of his 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.670
 waist 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.860
 let's take the measurement then leaving 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.860
 approximately about 5 centimeters for 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.700
 to be able to flip a little bit and 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.700
 then cut us 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.310
 the next thing then it would apply the 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:30.340
 silicone that we're going to put it around 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.549
 of the pebble that we have already stuck and 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.880
 let's apply a little quantity or what 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:39.220
 enough to be able to adhere the cord 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.190
 let's then take the measure of 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:46.490
 lace we cut it in half 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.790
 and then we're going to hit one side 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.790
 the other 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:55.130
 making sure to join it in the part of 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:59.010
 up and let's hold a momentum 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.410
 until it is dry 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:05.270
 if necessary we reinforce in the parts 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.270
 where they have been missing glue 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.560
 let's go now to place a 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:23.780
 second layer of silicone around for 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.790
 place the strass ribbon and what 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.799
 let's do is apply again but 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.560
 very carefully a quantity 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:32.599
 enough that it's not too abundant for 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.459
 that afterwards you are not seeing the 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.459
 silicone in the project 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.150
 let's take the strass ribbon the 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.150
 let's place 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:51.590
 starting from where the cord ended 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.820
 previous we are placing it and then 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.820
 we cut the surplus 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.560
 now let's take the cord 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:09.010
 of another color and we are going to place one 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.739
 second cord line attached with the 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:15.330
 silicone we repeat exactly the same 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.330
 what we did with the first cord 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.840
 now we take the lavender cord 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:37.000
 we repeat the action again trying to 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.340
 make it more polished the cleanest 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.120
 possible for us to have a design 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.120
 so cute 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.630
 once our craft has dried 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.120
 what we will do is cut by 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.310
 entire edge to remove excess 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.400
 cloth 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.040
 then then we take the laces and 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.220
 we divide in half and we are going to paste 3 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:06.209
 to one side doing as a curve and 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.209
 then to the other side 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.850
 well once it's dry then we're going to 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:29.919
 cut everything we have left so that 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.919
 our project is well polished 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.180
 and we have barely matched the laces 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.210
 then we will re-apply 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:47.600
 silicone around the edge at all 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:50.710
 around to apply or paste a 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.710
 second layer of fabric 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.169
 what we are going to do now is then 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:09.470
 re- trim everything around and 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:09.470
 remove excess cloth and let dry 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:25.460
 Now what we are going to do is place them 

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:26.990
 crochet for it we are going to take 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:31.520
 then a scalpel and let's make a 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:33.740
 small hole in the back of 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.950
 where we are going to place the rings or 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:39.830
 place the hook directly 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:42.050
 If you prefer that your arito 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:45.440
 long then you can place two 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.360
 rings one intertwined with the other or 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.160
 if you prefer it to be short then 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.210
 we are simply going to place the crochet 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:56.889
 directly for it then we open 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.889
 the ring that has at the end 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:05.710
 and let's tie it to put the wire 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:09.120
 through the hole from the side of the 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.120
 front and then we close 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.030
 and so our project is then a 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.460
 very easy project to do that I hope 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:27.970
 that you liked, remember how 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:30.280
