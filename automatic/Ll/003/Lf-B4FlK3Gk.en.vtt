00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 welcome gentlemen them some more 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.009
 false occasion for ten pressures and in 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.259
 this opportunity we bring you the roll 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.790
 of pitch in time and the pimp understood 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.469
 is an expansion of hydrates to make 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.049
 pleasant 10 does not work to know all of 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.700
 intro and it has a cost 29 dollars what 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.770
 can buy directly in the 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.900
 software a long time ago or on the page 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.670
 ceratto which is what makes pucheta in 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.170
 what he does is better and the result is 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.720
 kilo when working with a change 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.119
 drastic bpm is more noticeable when 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.630
 low that knows climbs I would say that to 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.579
 from -12% down, you can see that 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.950
 the process that is doing the kilo with 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.480
 which comes that data is not very good 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.370
 it was noticed a half plastic sound and 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.460
 when we move on from that on the less 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.710
 25 to below if the audio is not here 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.170
 is not well processed it shows that the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.750
 singer stutters of some effects or 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.530
 something improved in that sound but it changes 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.230
 with the kilo 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.570
 the sound is much more natural as I said 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.969
 it shows more when he got off his kiss 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.219
 we will see it in the following example and 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.809
 to be able to do a demo of how 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.750
 the andy pitcher works and we're going to 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.430
 work first the normal kilo after 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.820
 let's work the tiny peak and with 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.820
 values 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.710
 66 25 and 50 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.940
 yes 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.090
 Y 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.470
 now we are not going up 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.920
 Y 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.260
 we make a broom here and they gave 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.680
 account the more you reduce the value 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.380
 from lpm the kilo you could tell he did not make a 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.060
 natural process of that sound equally 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.640
 when we went up and in more basic values 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.740
 it did not sound good so now we're going 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.620
 to approve the pitch in time and we enter 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.690
 zp in the expansion tab pax let's go 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.120
 to submit andy and we click on 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.819
 enable 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.310
 we went out 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.469
 we see the pitch icon in time that has 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.920
 replaced the kilo icon and thank you 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:03:02.159
 to the tests we will do the same 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.909
 let's go at least 8 minus 16 minus 25 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:09.540
 and minus 50 and you will find out if you compare 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:11.579
 with the previous -16 than that 1900 with the 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.060
 pitch and i'm dj is a lot more sound 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.060
 natural 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.740
 yes yes 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.540
 let up 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.050
 we make another break and under the next 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.080
 example to see if all the claw or we are going to 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.030
 work an example on the -25 much 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.320
 the kilo as the pitch in time so that 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.500
 It is working as both 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.500
 keys 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.250
 plus 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:38.730
 Y 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.250
 and if you still do not get it 34 minutes 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.200
 444 cel verses now definitely 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.610
 as I said it shows more in the descent than 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.590
 on the rise because we have done that 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.330
 over at least 25 times 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.010
 now those days that want to work 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.780
 with manual transitions making them 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.100
 yourselves definitely the 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.140
 pitching is also an excellent 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:06:00.220
 tool for those who wish to work 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:02.800
 with transitions on the minus 12 to 15 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.870
 % the picking time and it is an excellent 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.670
 investment to those who can not work 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.340
 with the kilo with which comes the same 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.690
 cerrato without major problem with gentlemen 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.190
 now if he says goodbye he seemed to have been 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.810

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.340
