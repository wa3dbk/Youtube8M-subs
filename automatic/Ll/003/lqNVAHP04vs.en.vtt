are then wrapped around the poles and

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:56.729 
are then wrapped around the poles and
then<00:00:54.640> velcro<00:00:55.030> tabs<00:00:55.270> in<00:00:55.480> place<00:00:55.719> you<00:00:56.440> see<00:00:56.590> that

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
then velcro tabs in place you see that

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:57.900 
then velcro tabs in place you see that
there<00:00:56.890> is<00:00:56.920> one<00:00:57.010> at<00:00:57.280> the<00:00:57.370> top<00:00:57.579> and<00:00:57.790> at<00:00:57.850> the

bottom of every pole down the side of
the<00:00:59.559> temp<00:00:59.800> these<00:01:00.219> are<00:01:00.430> then<00:01:00.550> attached<00:01:00.910> to<00:01:01.210> our

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
the temp these are then attached to our

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.819 
the temp these are then attached to our
guidelines<00:01:01.719> and<00:01:02.079> when<00:01:02.200> the<00:01:02.320> guidelines<00:01:02.530> are

guidelines and when the guidelines are
pegged<00:01:03.039> out<00:01:03.190> it<00:01:03.640> brings<00:01:03.820> a<00:01:03.940> whole<00:01:03.969> fly<00:01:04.390> sheet

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
pegged out it brings a whole fly sheet

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.480 
pegged out it brings a whole fly sheet
against<00:01:05.019> the<00:01:05.110> frame<00:01:05.289> of<00:01:05.439> the<00:01:05.530> tent<00:01:05.770> making<00:01:06.280> the

against the frame of the tent making the
whole<00:01:06.670> tent<00:01:06.940> much<00:01:07.180> more<00:01:07.420> stable<00:01:07.659> making<00:01:08.590> sure

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
whole tent much more stable making sure

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.930 
whole tent much more stable making sure
that<00:01:08.799> you<00:01:08.890> can<00:01:08.979> use<00:01:09.159> it<00:01:09.280> even<00:01:09.369> in<00:01:09.549> high<00:01:09.700> wind

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
that you can use it even in high wind

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.120 
that you can use it even in high wind
conditions<00:01:10.530> all<00:01:11.530> of<00:01:11.680> the<00:01:11.770> guidelines

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
conditions all of the guidelines

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.770 
conditions all of the guidelines
themselves<00:01:12.280> are<00:01:12.820> our<00:01:12.970> overall<00:01:13.420> luminous

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.030 
themselves are our overall luminous
guideline<00:01:14.170> so<00:01:14.350> hopefully<00:01:14.680> you're<00:01:14.830> not<00:01:14.890> going

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
guideline so hopefully you're not going

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.740 
guideline so hopefully you're not going
to<00:01:15.100> trip<00:01:15.220> over<00:01:15.340> these<00:01:15.580> craters<00:01:15.850> easily<00:01:16.270> and

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
to trip over these craters easily and

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.300 
to trip over these craters easily and
you'll<00:01:16.930> also<00:01:17.049> find<00:01:17.350> that<00:01:17.530> each<00:01:17.680> Gale<00:01:17.950> Lane<00:01:18.130> has

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
you'll also find that each Gale Lane has

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.100 
you'll also find that each Gale Lane has
its<00:01:18.490> own<00:01:18.610> retainer<00:01:18.970> so<00:01:19.540> when<00:01:19.689> it<00:01:19.810> comes<00:01:19.960> to

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
its own retainer so when it comes to

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.690 
its own retainer so when it comes to
packing<00:01:20.290> down<00:01:20.590> a<00:01:20.619> tent<00:01:20.920> we<00:01:21.040> can<00:01:21.189> just<00:01:21.369> roll<00:01:21.670> up

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
packing down a tent we can just roll up

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.760 
packing down a tent we can just roll up
the<00:01:21.909> Guylaine<00:01:22.240> in<00:01:22.450> our<00:01:22.570> hand<00:01:22.780> and<00:01:22.990> pop<00:01:23.560> it<00:01:23.680> in

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
the Guylaine in our hand and pop it in

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.440 
the Guylaine in our hand and pop it in
here<00:01:23.979> so<00:01:24.159> the<00:01:24.310> next<00:01:24.460> time<00:01:24.729> we<00:01:24.850> come<00:01:25.000> to<00:01:25.150> use<00:01:25.299> the

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
here so the next time we come to use the

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.910 
here so the next time we come to use the
tent<00:01:25.659> these<00:01:26.049> are<00:01:26.170> going<00:01:26.290> to<00:01:26.350> be<00:01:26.500> easily

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
tent these are going to be easily

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.000

so you can either toggle these halfway

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.470 
so you can either toggle these halfway
up<00:02:38.470> or<00:02:39.010> they<00:02:39.430> can<00:02:39.610> be<00:02:39.730> fully<00:02:39.970> closed<00:02:40.270> as<00:02:40.450> well

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
polyethylene so it's really tough and

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.870 
polyethylene so it's really tough and
durable<00:02:55.930> it<00:02:56.620> has<00:02:56.770> a<00:02:56.800> hydrostatic<00:02:57.550> head<00:02:57.670> of<00:02:57.790> at

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
durable it has a hydrostatic head of at

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.790 
durable it has a hydrostatic head of at
least<00:02:58.030> 10,000<00:02:58.570> millimeters<00:02:59.020> then<00:02:59.650> the

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
least 10,000 millimeters then the

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.350 
least 10,000 millimeters then the

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
growing seat in the rear of the tent in

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.060 
growing seat in the rear of the tent in
the<00:03:01.390> main<00:03:01.600> living<00:03:01.780> section<00:03:02.290> is<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.800> exact

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
the main living section is the exact

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.500 
the main living section is the exact
same<00:03:03.220> material<00:03:03.400> but<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.880> only<00:03:04.000> difference<00:03:04.360> is

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
same material but the only difference is

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.690 
same material but the only difference is
is<00:03:04.660> it's<00:03:04.900> fully<00:03:05.140> sealed<00:03:05.470> all<00:03:06.100> the<00:03:06.160> way<00:03:06.310> around

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
is it's fully sealed all the way around

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.820 
is it's fully sealed all the way around
each<00:03:06.970> side<00:03:07.300> insuring<00:03:08.260> that<00:03:08.290> it's<00:03:08.590> not<00:03:08.709> gonna

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
each side insuring that it's not gonna

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.380 
each side insuring that it's not gonna
allow<00:03:09.010> any<00:03:09.220> drafts<00:03:09.640> in<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:09.970> hopefully<00:03:10.300> it's

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
allow any drafts in and hopefully it's

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.910 
allow any drafts in and hopefully it's
going<00:03:10.480> to<00:03:10.540> keep<00:03:10.690> out<00:03:10.840> those<00:03:11.020> unwanted<00:03:11.410> bugs<00:03:11.739> as

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
going to keep out those unwanted bugs as

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.250 
going to keep out those unwanted bugs as
well<00:03:12.540> stepping<00:03:13.540> into<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:13.810> tent<00:03:13.989> itself
