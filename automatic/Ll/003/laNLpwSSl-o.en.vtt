00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:09.420
 I'm back for a short break 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.059
 you 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.629
 I have announced here that my son 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.760
 view and I just do not have time 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:20.670
 for you to upload videos 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.099
 I had you here announced that I 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.589
 That's why you want to lie to it 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:28.919
 I know that I am diligent in everything 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:30.599
 then started to take it only once 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:33.630
 that the parents got to know each other 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.530
 have what it is but so with us 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.829
 Turks what the parents of the groom to 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.860
 the parents of the bride go around the hand 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.410
 to keep the daughter and I have everything 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.750
 done traditionally and with it that 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.660
 may look I have everything of course 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.329
 We recorded then we started 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.879
 Of course everything to prepare if you 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.750
 then the first time to go to the parents 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.030
 and you do not know each other then 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.309
 have to make some preparations 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.560
 and I want you now 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.680
 let's see what she prepares so everything 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.140
 I have red rose fitte needs it 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.860
 Of course you have to pay attention to the roses 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:22.920
 correctly guide and with long stalk 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:28.290
 and always just number starts with 7 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:31.079
 and then upwards 7 9 11 13 15 17 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.909
 I have now bought 15 pieces and 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.430
 I hope that will happen 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.890
 is sufficient I have then anyway 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.270
 again a bouquet for mom 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:45.329
 bought because yes she has the child on the 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.310
 World and also has a lot of time and 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.820
 energy consumed for you and you 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.469
 Earn more than a bunch of flowers and 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.750
 now go empty-handed 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:58.660
 that's why it's for the mom 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.810
 We'll take that with us too 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:05.860
 Although that's what the kong dollar is called 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:08.590
 I would say a splendor there 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.320
 it's just nasty chocolate pure 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.920
 filled that we take with it for 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:17.080
 the bride and when he is around the hand of 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.990
 daughter is held then then 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.390
 this chocolate to the family and to 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.540
 the guests who are there on the day 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.840
 distributed one calls it with us then also 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.190
 eat so sweet and talk well 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.540
 I hope I have that too 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.280
 translated that is available in silver and in 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.520
 I actually wanted everything in gold 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.470
 I found silver but gold 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.170
 also does not look bad on the outside 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.020
 also exactly with the roche it's yes 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.450
 also wrapped in a god foil by 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.110
 That's why I do not even think so 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.600
 bad 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.910
 I hope you do not like it either 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.489
 know how many people was about 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.830
 be and the chocolate will be completely 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:03.459
 may be enough, I then again 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.709
 bought two packages of noble chocolates so 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.410
 that is very very important for me 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.410
 my turkish subscribers if you 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:14.080
 marries or the daughter of the son like 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.660
 always good to know that then 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.630
 Of course, always classically plump in power 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.450
 and the roses that is very 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.480
 good roses are because so mediated 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.459
 yourselves and of course baklava 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.070
 must not be missing then we have one 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.140
 Sheet metal is purchased in a report 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.000
 I think five kilo trainer so completely 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.370
 I do not know exactly 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.680
 but that's one of those things 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.470
 a sheet of baklava takes along as I said 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:45.130
 this will be distributed to the guests 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:48.510
 So first the father of 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.019
 Grooms yes to the daughter's hand 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.540
 receive 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.489
 and if he says yes that's it 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.670
 very early and that's what makes it 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.500
 we will still be with us as a tradition 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.180
 and I think it's really very 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.239
 nice that we still have 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:08.049
 live out and when it is over then 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:10.900
 the bride comes with coffee and it is 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:14.349
 then always usual that they are coffee 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.900
 for the groom instead of sugar salt line 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:20.109
 So the groom has to do that 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:23.199
 still drinking so I am now 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.240
 finished with my pie that had everything 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:27.729
 go fast because I'm really very 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.060
 short of time I have to go into 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:34.240
 an hour away I have mine now 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.610
 pie with chocolate coated and with 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.000
 the subjects that I made myself 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.690
 I decorated and when with the heart 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.539
 I film here with transfer 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:49.960
 have cut out then have again 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:52.259
 here the writing is written down that it 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.570
 then in our usual potty 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:05:00.360
 tradition if you then at the hand of 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:03.370
 daughter keeps you make 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.349
 relaxing it is here sometimes the name 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.150
 written 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:09.669
 the place is unfortunately scarce so far 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.800
 but still have it with either 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:15.039
 white chocolate hinbekommen so 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:18.310
 that could also be about doing that 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:20.169
 only an idea of â€‹â€‹me but the pie is 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.639
 become really delicious that I know so 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:25.840
 I already had a cake 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:28.330
 baked and the decor hopefully 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.310
 do you like the decoration you can do it too 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.380
 Of course decorate differently 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.880
 I have the first ones here again 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:39.280
 Letters still made of chocolate 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:42.849
 That's what my finished pie looks like 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:46.650
 I hope you would like the recipe 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:50.169
 I would just recommend you 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:53.650
 the turkish subscribers if you too 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:55.599
 now for a wedding is that you 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.159
 then just bake yourself, of course 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:59.409
 You can also buy as well we have 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:01.949
 bought baklava but that comes from 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:01.949
 heart
