00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.330
 or not 

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.330
 today 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.030
 today I want to talk about infidelity 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.250
 which is a rather complex subject of 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.770
 understand and understand why 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.070
 they touch many aspects within the 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.860
 partner 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.480
 first of all let's say that that 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.640
 clichÃ© that men are more 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.830
 unfaithful that women are going to 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.570
 end with them because because the 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.939
 psychoanalysis comes to check that 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.829
 when an infidelity occurs when 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.780
 Abuse occurs when it occurs 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.000
 a problem within the couple you have to 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.120
 analyze the two parts because always 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.420
 we find that a person does not have 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.769
 power to do everything he does if the 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.620
 another one has not previously been authorized 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:49.180
 that is, to produce a 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.640
 infidelity because it has to pass a 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.829
 time to be mistreated has 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.730
 that there is a time to process a 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.039
 deterioration in the couple 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.660
 I want to say that all the tests of the 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.329
 couple in an unconscious way 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.980
 they were like building what he wants 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.750
 to say with this that infidelities 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.800
 they are also being built with the 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:11.440
 time not because there are usually or dropouts 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.229
 impairments or certain permits or 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.929
 certain incommunications that go 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.580
 making the couple not push 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:20.230
 one another 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.450
 so we could say that it is a 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.830
 infidelity clear that here we always 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.360
 let's wash your hands both the 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.270
 men like women and nobody wants 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.070
 nobody is going to want to affect your part of 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.810
 responsibility within such a fact 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.600
 important as it can be to appear 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.920
 the word infidelity 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.620
 we have to also define what is the 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.660
 infidelity or what is faithfulness because 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.540
 Faithfulness is really confused 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.070
 loving with sexual fidelity or the 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.800
 loving infidelity with infidelity 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.680
 also sexual when really the 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.229
 couple is good in the couple impact 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.229
 we can not always receive that the 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.420
 infidelity is much more to the 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.220
 pacts that the couple has established that 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.590
 good that other issues that not in the 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.930
 background are confused and are not or that 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.550
 they are not because also what is true 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.160
 is that there is certain integrity data 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.170
 that what they do is that the couple well 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.240
 break but it is also true that there 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.610
 certain degrees or certain infidelities 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.100
 that when they are discovered mostly 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.110
 They serve to attract attention as 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.300
 saying that something is happening here 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.130
 that something is happening to us and that 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.230
 wakeup call really 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.920
 is infidelity because it helps us 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.230
 that the couple 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.020
 think what is happening to you and why 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.120
 what is happening is happening 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.150
 it's all for good it makes me tell you that 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.920
 what I told you a few moments ago 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.440
 that within inferiority we can 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.260
 consider loving infidelities or 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.060
 the sexual infidelities in the case 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.700
 of man and we will talk about another day of 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:53.590
 woman I do not say the same thing again 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:56.120
 when a man is unfaithful to a woman 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.190
 may well be the incident is the point 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.040
 of loving sight is to be with your 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.040
 couple and fall in love and love another woman 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.840
 but it can also be that within your 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.150
 relationship of couple for some 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.070
 circumstances that would also have to 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.990
 analyze from the point of view of 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.550
 woman for sexual relations to 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.740
 better not working as they should 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.390
 work because good because there are 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.430
 a lack of communication because the 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.440
 lack of appetite and then also 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.780
 that can make man so 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.850
 bus-bonus that we say outside the 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.380
 relationship of couple what does not find 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.270
 within your relationship 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.670
 what does it mean by this that the 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.820
 would impede you really have to work it 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.820
 as a warning not in the 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.510
 I sense that something comes to say too 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:45.640
 it's true as I said at the beginning of 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:49.960
 this tutorial not that an infertility 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.700
 it is also built not and then inside 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.940
 of the sexuality of man we can 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.190
 see clearly that when the relationship 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.040
 with the woman 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.340
 let's say it touches certain aspects that can 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.080
 fall into the so-called relationships 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.960
 parentheses there we see that it is more 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.480
 easy for the man to end up making a 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.490
 infidelity what does this mean? 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.820
 it's very simple that in many relationships 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:19.330
 The woman ends up being the mother 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:21.220
 true of the husband and in the end that's 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:24.190
 a relationship like mother and son more than 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.020
 man and woman that means that when 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.270
 the position of the woman is very maternal 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.070
 with respect to man or man 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.800
 it's like a very child with respect to women 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.909
 there you lose 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:38.849
 let's say the couple does not therefore 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:40.590
 sexualities appear then is the 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:44.280
 woman's attitude respect to 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:46.680
 man is very very motherly evidently 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.319
 the sexual relations between them go 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.289
 why should we say why? 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:54.270
 be maternal hoisted too much relationship is 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:56.460
 she has become too loving she has 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.220
 turned something else that what would have to 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.919
 be a man and woman relationship of 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:06.419
 way that's how this is like 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:08.610
 the lever that would trigger not in the 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.860
 couple relationship what would be the 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.050
 infidelity is to say that man 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.509
 then going to have relationships 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:19.289
 now with other women and the 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:21.090
 affectionate maternal loving relationship with 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:24.030
 who goes to sleep then went to kimba to 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.219
 love is the woman with whom he is at his 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.629
 side what does this mean then of 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:29.969
 that here is the question of the two 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:32.759
 clearly that the two inadvertently 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:35.040
 have fallen in this relationship to me 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:36.840
 understand quite neurotic why 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.090
 because what has to be done has disappeared 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.870
 being a block had to be a woman and 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.890
 a relationship has been built 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:46.740
 maternal-filial therefore if a woman 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.660
 feels that the man really loves her 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.460
 but that is going to bet with another or has 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.070
 discovered that he is sleeping with 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.050
 another one has to rethink that 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.000
 also something is failing in it not 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.470
 because it's very easy to do when 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.660
 say hey if it is that he is lying down 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.210
 We are now, but it's good that 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.550
 you have also stopped being a woman and 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.500
 your husband no longer see you your partner does not 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.390
 see how a woman I have as a mother and 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.660
 obviously 7 as a mother present 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:14.190
 sex is lessened or you want by going 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.350
 so and that to rethink it I want 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:19.500
 say that you do not have to punish the 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:22.410
 person because he is unfaithful there is no 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:25.200
 look for a scapegoat let's say no in 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:27.540
 the man because I said he is being 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.610
 unfaithful has been several times you have to 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.310
 analyze because that has been built 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.450
 infidelity and how the two have come to 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.070
 that situation 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.510
 in this way we can understand 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.220
 also the mechanism of unhappiness 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:39.750
 In the man 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.850
 it's good that it has its peculiarities 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:44.550
 as we said but always 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:47.490
 mostly occur when man 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:50.490
 feel that you need to say with a degree 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:52.080
 of sexuality within your partner or 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.390
 it can also be a loving degree not 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.460
 because although it is true in women who 

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:57.780
 would not have a problem then 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.030
 to lie down to have sex 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.650
 sexual but have difficulties 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:03.510
 to love man not and man 

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:06.090
 It is also true that when you do not 

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:07.740
 feels dear will also look for the 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:09.810
 love of a woman outside the notion of 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.370
 couple not then there is a respect 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:14.190
 demon is that as a woman I have very good 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:15.690
 sex but I do not feel that I love 

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:17.850
 I feel the love that I need not 

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:19.320
 I feel that strength you give me love and 

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:22.110
 that makes you look for it outside then there's 

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.850
 to think that when man seeks 

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:25.920
 things out of the couple is because something 

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:27.990
 is failing in the relationship then 

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.940
 well it is not shown to anyone and 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:32.460
 let's dedicate ourselves to work these issues 

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:35.400
 and well, psychoanalysis allows 

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:37.290
 make understand the position of both one 

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.060
 as from another and good is made to understand 

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.919
 also this kind of situations that 

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:43.289
 always to my understanding are calls from 

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:46.229
 attention that allow reconstruct 

00:07:43.289 --> 00:07:48.539
 remake and solve a couple problem 

00:07:46.229 --> 00:07:50.159
 in the next tutorial for nothing 

00:07:48.539 --> 00:07:52.409
 I want to talk about why women 

00:07:50.159 --> 00:07:53.969
 tend to infidelity and what can I 

00:07:52.409 --> 00:07:55.889
 make a woman obviously so 

00:07:53.969 --> 00:07:59.119
 also infer a man many 

00:07:55.889 --> 00:07:59.119
 Thank you until next time
