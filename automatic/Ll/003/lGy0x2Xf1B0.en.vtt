00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
opposite direction okay so you can do a

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.729 
opposite direction okay so you can do a
lot<00:03:26.780> with<00:03:27.140> one<00:03:27.620> rein<00:03:28.810> a<00:03:29.810> lot<00:03:30.290> more<00:03:30.500> than<00:03:30.650> you

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
lot with one rein a lot more than you

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.400

circle we pulled our pocket we tighten

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.599 
circle we pulled our pocket we tighten
that<00:03:40.160> circle<00:03:40.519> down<00:03:41.140> we<00:03:42.140> pull<00:03:42.350> across<00:03:42.620> we<00:03:43.430> can

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
that circle down we pull across we can

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.190 
that circle down we pull across we can
actually<00:03:43.790> make<00:03:44.120> you<00:03:44.239> move<00:03:44.420> off<00:03:44.630> over<00:03:44.959> here

where<00:04:03.260> to<00:04:03.350> go<00:04:03.500> it's<00:04:04.070> the<00:04:04.220> front<00:04:04.579> tire<00:04:04.850> that's

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
where to go it's the front tire that's

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.660 
where to go it's the front tire that's
touching<00:04:05.510> the<00:04:05.780> round<00:04:06.050> that<00:04:06.500> determines<00:04:07.040> which

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
touching the round that determines which

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.460 
touching the round that determines which
way<00:04:07.909> this<00:04:08.090> horse<00:04:08.330> goes

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
way this horse goes

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.530 
way this horse goes
so<00:04:10.430> if<00:04:10.520> you<00:04:10.610> want<00:04:10.760> to<00:04:10.790> teach<00:04:11.000> your<00:04:11.150> horse<00:04:11.210> to

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
spin and do reining patterns you just

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.000 
spin and do reining patterns you just
advance<00:04:14.300> on<00:04:14.540> this<00:04:14.810> you<00:04:15.260> just<00:04:15.410> do<00:04:15.650> the<00:04:15.800> same

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
advance on this you just do the same

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.940 
advance on this you just do the same
thing<00:04:16.600> and<00:04:17.600> you<00:04:17.750> teach<00:04:17.959> this<00:04:18.200> horse<00:04:18.470> to<00:04:18.680> step

thing and you teach this horse to step

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.510 
thing and you teach this horse to step
across<00:04:19.660> step<00:04:20.660> across<00:04:20.930> step<00:04:21.590> across<00:04:21.860> step

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
across step across step across step

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.830 
across step across step across step
across<00:04:23.080> write<00:04:24.080> him<00:04:24.230> out<00:04:24.320> of<00:04:24.500> it<00:04:25.570> step<00:04:26.570> across

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
across write him out of it step across

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.590 
across write him out of it step across
and<00:04:27.290> the<00:04:27.530> if<00:04:27.830> you're<00:04:28.160> going<00:04:28.340> to<00:04:28.520> the<00:04:28.670> right<00:04:28.910> the

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
and the if you're going to the right the

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.560 
and the if you're going to the right the
left<00:04:29.870> front<00:04:30.170> foot<00:04:30.470> should<00:04:30.950> step<00:04:31.310> ahead<00:04:31.460> of<00:04:31.970> the

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
left front foot should step ahead of the

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.450 
left front foot should step ahead of the
right<00:04:32.750> front<00:04:32.960> foot<00:04:33.320> there<00:04:34.010> should<00:04:34.160> always<00:04:34.340> be

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
right front foot there should always be

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.050 
right front foot there should always be
forward<00:04:35.180> motion<00:04:35.660> in<00:04:35.840> this<00:04:36.200> turn<00:04:36.760> this<00:04:37.760> is<00:04:37.940> an

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
forward motion in this turn this is an

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.150 
forward motion in this turn this is an
unnatural<00:04:38.390> move<00:04:38.900> for<00:04:39.140> a<00:04:39.170> horse<00:04:39.440> so<00:04:39.710> he<00:04:39.800> has<00:04:39.980> to

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
unnatural move for a horse so he has to

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.810 
unnatural move for a horse so he has to
learn<00:04:40.460> just<00:04:41.210> cross<00:04:41.600> his<00:04:41.900> legs<00:04:42.430> okay<00:04:43.430> and<00:04:43.670> if<00:04:43.760> he

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
learn just cross his legs okay and if he

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.190 
learn just cross his legs okay and if he
gets<00:04:43.940> bound<00:04:44.300> up<00:04:44.600> write<00:04:45.380> him<00:04:45.500> out<00:04:45.620> of<00:04:45.800> it<00:04:47.050> go<00:04:48.050> the

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
gets bound up write him out of it go the

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.560 
gets bound up write him out of it go the
other<00:04:48.230> way

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
other way

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.180 
other way
you<00:04:50.570> can<00:04:50.720> start<00:04:50.990> in<00:04:51.110> a<00:04:51.170> big<00:04:51.350> circle<00:04:51.590> and<00:04:51.950> wind

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
you can start in a big circle and wind

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.390 
you can start in a big circle and wind
that<00:04:52.400> circle<00:04:52.760> down<00:04:53.650> and<00:04:54.650> teach<00:04:54.860> him<00:04:55.010> to<00:04:55.130> step

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
that circle down and teach him to step

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.940 
that circle down and teach him to step
across<00:04:55.640> step<00:04:56.330> across<00:04:56.710> driving<00:04:57.710> with<00:04:57.830> your
