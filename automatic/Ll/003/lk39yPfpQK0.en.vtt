00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 good guys video 5 we met 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:11.820
 comfortable 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:14.009
 As it looks like falling down, it does not have 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.080
 I felt the phrase danny please speak 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.230
 well uncle speaks well is today we are 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.230
 here 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.869
 very good and very good way to 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.820
 operational management of this career that 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.429
 if the race was an ice cream it would be you 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.810
 favorite ice cream once it is well 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.810
 he compared the really incredible things 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.329
 the last will be the first 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.329
 the first will be the first 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:49.020
 this much change so I think it goes 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.140
 to be easy 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.280
 a kid almost really but he has 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.280
 eaten half that's why I take out 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.570
 By the way, they grab me because they say it 's 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.370
 so cool and only uploading one 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.449
 mountain because quiet guys when 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.449
 we got to see what there is 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.720
 these are the advantages of making sidewalks 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.350
 so that two children normal the bad 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.350
 is that here 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.330
 I think there are two rascals to get there 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.370
 up the mountain doing little horse 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.150
 well I think that has been a bit 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:25.330
 risky to say it stone let's what 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.250
 that I exaggerated really does not have a 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.020
 push is a kid to try to find 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.270
 It is worse and you almost fall of bass 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.670
 mountain 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.159
 already for the next thing thought is to say 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.060
 here and there I almost put a bad pass 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.250
 we go 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.250
 again because the speed 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.090
 which site was flying above because no 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.090
 It's worth it although I already have it because below 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:02.170
 up and down because the 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:06.429
 stones and pine trees have me very 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.349
 stone and pineapple or are you going to see which tree 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:11.080
 where to go to jada it seems good 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.700
 interesting worth stereo eats the 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.620
 column 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.120
 my mother, this looks like a 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.730
 so complicated but I do not care 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.299
 like complicated things because 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.299
 perfect the jump 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.930
 guys first but it will be a bit 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.360
 complicated second turn with this one that I 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.620
 can win we're going to do it slowly and 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.120
 with good lyrics guys you know how I 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.610
 like ojito 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.000
 he has pushed me on his back to his 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.000
 back 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.060
 pulling the bike really well really 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.140
 Incredible incredible jump of truth in 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.670
 read instead of pulling the bike because he 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.980
 I found a 100 kilos bike in the 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.959
 back when telomerase more or less not 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.819
 I know it is not the guy throws me ship 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.069
 with his back he gave truth and please 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:09.010
 be the uncle is like as a bodybuilder 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.870
 super strong is a boy or his 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.269
 public sector in treatments with 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.890
 trains at a jump or are not much talking 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.290
 but because you have back provided 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.489
 these kid is worth the goal is to have anti 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.760
 and I get a feeling that I'm not going to 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:26.760
 get first in life to see I think that 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.760
 above 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.129
 we have to stop and we do 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.469
 but it does not matter if I try harder 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:58.019
 effort more by publishing the race with 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:59.670
 an eye eye a kid did not have almost almost 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.709
 I use the subscriber's back now 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.879
 as ramp gave for good is happening already 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.950
 This is already good, it's your turn 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:08.950
 make the pelendengues worth 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.819
 do not have to stop and go back to do another 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.819
 instead of the little horse that you do not know 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:20.079
 that's too fast uncle if you're 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.850
 between 58 really never get tired of 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:29.200
 say we stopped it up we're here 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.860
 and up again it's always there's no 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.770
 plus 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.870
 as simple as they are yes 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.210
 so that the life of the 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:41.580
 that there is already one that finished but good 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.580
 as if I choose or you are telling me 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:48.560
 but I want 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:50.670
 but wait for half of that to come 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.700
 this looks like it's a bit complicated 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.680
 of guys so what do I do the 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.540
 horse of exaggerated form but of 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.160
 another way I do not understand how to do it 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.410
 for we make the little horse so 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.660
 caballito caballito caballito a bera 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.190
 bera bera bera see but it is that I fall 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.270
 or game overcomes is only these are the 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.280
 typical endings that touch the 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.280
 Pelendengues in a very exaggerated way 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:21.789
 like the game because if this is not a 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:25.639
 cap that was not caught to acquire 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:28.909
 to know was a stick cap 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:31.069
 by guys is that I'm dying, I 'm dying 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:33.610
 I do uncle my mother mine kid this is 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:33.610
 impossible guys 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:39.330
 seriously it's impossible uncle but how 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.920
 want to catch the finish line when bears 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.130
 up I think if I hit pa lante 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.130
 A) Yes 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:50.940
 nothing I fall as they hit him low 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:53.340
 of sugar and stay flat 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.840
 to see is that I do not really understand paris 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:59.790
 and we do there and at the last moment 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:05.370
 braking is that I do not know how to do it worth 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:08.130
 thank goodness that is the last one forwards 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.960
 to collide the front wheel with a 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:11.550
 platform and win the race if it's something 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.880
 strange but that's how it was 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.880
 next 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:38.190
 and 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.190
 yes
