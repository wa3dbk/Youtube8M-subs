all<00:00:01.170> right<00:00:01.439> I<00:00:01.469> just<00:00:01.530> wanted<00:00:01.860> to<00:00:01.979> do<00:00:02.129> a<00:00:02.159> video<00:00:02.639> on

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:03.170 
all right I just wanted to do a video on

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.050 
all right I just wanted to do a video on
the<00:00:04.170> column<00:00:04.950> shift<00:00:05.190> three-speed<00:00:05.730> column

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
the column shift three-speed column

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.089 
the column shift three-speed column
shift<00:00:06.299> or<00:00:06.540> three<00:00:06.779> on<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:06.960> tree<00:00:07.109> what<00:00:08.010> we're

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
shift or three on the tree what we're

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.650 
shift or three on the tree what we're
looking<00:00:08.340> at<00:00:08.490> here<00:00:08.820> is<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.240> shift<00:00:09.480> linkage

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
looking at here is the shift linkage

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.110 
looking at here is the shift linkage
this<00:00:10.559> is<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.889> firewall<00:00:11.370> of<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.639> truck<00:00:11.880> I'll

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
this is the firewall of the truck I'll

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.280 
this is the firewall of the truck I'll
back<00:00:12.269> up<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.509> little<00:00:12.599> bit<00:00:12.719> so<00:00:12.900> you<00:00:12.960> can<00:00:12.990> kind<00:00:13.080> of

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
back up a little bit so you can kind of

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.530 
back up a little bit so you can kind of
get<00:00:13.410> into<00:00:13.559> perspective

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
get into perspective

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.470 
get into perspective
here's<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.750> motor<00:00:16.250> brake<00:00:17.250> master<00:00:17.970> cylinder

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
here's the motor brake master cylinder

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.070 
here's the motor brake master cylinder
and<00:00:18.539> booster<00:00:18.890> this<00:00:19.890> is<00:00:20.070> where<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:21.080> steering

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
and booster this is where the steering

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.570 
and booster this is where the steering
column<00:00:22.320> comes<00:00:22.650> right<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.010> firewall

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
column comes right to the firewall

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.450 
column comes right to the firewall
those<00:00:23.760> are<00:00:23.880> my<00:00:23.939> shift<00:00:24.180> linkage<00:00:24.300> just<00:00:25.400> let<00:00:26.400> me

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
those are my shift linkage just let me

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.920 
those are my shift linkage just let me
get<00:00:26.580> inside<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.000> truck<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.420> shift<00:00:27.779> through

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
get inside the truck and shift through

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:52.619 
get inside the truck and shift through
the<00:00:27.960> gears<00:00:28.050> so<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.410> can<00:00:28.529> see<00:00:28.650> what's<00:00:28.800> going<00:00:28.859> on

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.670 

okay<00:00:53.629> that's<00:00:53.869> how<00:00:53.930> the<00:00:53.989> shift<00:00:54.260> linkage<00:00:54.379> is

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
okay that's how the shift linkage is

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.679 
okay that's how the shift linkage is
work<00:00:54.890> we'll<00:00:55.640> get<00:00:55.789> down<00:00:55.939> here<00:00:56.180> underneath<00:00:56.479> the

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:56.689 
work we'll get down here underneath the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:01:05.609 
work we'll get down here underneath the
truck<00:01:01.600> dark<00:01:03.070> but<00:01:04.070> those<00:01:04.250> are<00:01:04.399> those<00:01:04.519> same

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
truck dark but those are those same

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.680 
truck dark but those are those same
linkages<00:01:06.619> we<00:01:06.770> were<00:01:06.890> seeing<00:01:08.679> came<00:01:09.679> over<00:01:09.920> here

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
linkages we were seeing came over here

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.300 
linkages we were seeing came over here
and<00:01:11.690> they<00:01:12.289> connect<00:01:12.710> to<00:01:12.830> the<00:01:12.920> side<00:01:13.130> of<00:01:13.250> the

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
and they connect to the side of the

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.850 
and they connect to the side of the
transmission<00:01:15.399> this<00:01:16.399> is<00:01:16.610> a<00:01:17.229> regular<00:01:18.229> manual

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
transmission this is a regular manual

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.449 
transmission this is a regular manual
transmission<00:01:20.740> back<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:21.920> zoom<00:01:22.100> up<00:01:22.250> a<00:01:22.340> little

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:22.459 
transmission back the zoom up a little

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:25.120 
transmission back the zoom up a little
bit<00:01:22.869> it's<00:01:23.869> just<00:01:24.140> like<00:01:24.319> any<00:01:24.560> stick<00:01:24.890> shift

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
bit it's just like any stick shift

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.649 
bit it's just like any stick shift
transmission<00:01:25.429> just<00:01:26.240> doesn't<00:01:26.539> have<00:01:26.630> the

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
transmission just doesn't have the

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.139 
transmission just doesn't have the
shifter<00:01:27.049> coming<00:01:27.289> to<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:27.470> floor

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
shifter coming to the floor

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.219 
shifter coming to the floor
there's<00:01:29.149> the<00:01:29.509> hydraulic<00:01:30.350> clutch<00:01:30.560> cylinder

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
there's the hydraulic clutch cylinder

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.270

truck<00:01:33.229> is<00:01:33.440> trying<00:01:33.709> to<00:01:33.770> roll<00:01:33.890> on<00:01:34.069> me<00:01:34.190> a<00:01:34.220> little

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
truck is trying to roll on me a little

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:41.080 
truck is trying to roll on me a little
bit<00:01:34.459> here<00:01:34.670> you<00:01:35.479> can<00:01:35.630> fix<00:01:35.780> my<00:01:35.899> parking<00:01:36.200> brake<00:01:40.090> as

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
bit here you can fix my parking brake as

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.940 
bit here you can fix my parking brake as
you<00:01:41.269> can<00:01:41.390> see<00:01:41.599> it's<00:01:42.050> got<00:01:42.229> three<00:01:42.440> pedals<00:01:42.769> just

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
you can see it's got three pedals just

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.979 
you can see it's got three pedals just
like<00:01:43.280> any<00:01:43.459> stick<00:01:43.729> shift<00:01:43.970> clutch<00:01:44.539> pedal<00:01:44.840> brake

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:44.989 
like any stick shift clutch pedal brake

00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:47.949 
like any stick shift clutch pedal brake
pedal<00:01:45.319> and<00:01:45.379> gas<00:01:45.560> pedal<00:01:46.509> any<00:01:47.509> difference<00:01:47.810> is

pedal and gas pedal any difference is

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:52.600 
pedal and gas pedal any difference is
the<00:01:48.110> shifters<00:01:48.470> on<00:01:48.619> the<00:01:48.709> collar<00:01:51.459> right<00:01:52.459> now

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
the shifters on the collar right now

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.350 
the shifters on the collar right now
we're<00:01:52.819> in<00:01:52.879> second<00:01:53.239> gear<00:01:53.420> pull<00:01:54.379> it<00:01:54.500> in<00:01:54.619> neutral

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
we're in second gear pull it in neutral

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.639 
we're in second gear pull it in neutral
you<00:01:56.360> can<00:01:56.390> see<00:01:56.569> how<00:01:56.690> there's<00:01:56.989> two<00:01:57.050> gates<00:01:57.410> or

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
you can see how there's two gates or

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:59.589 
you can see how there's two gates or
going<00:01:57.890> towards<00:01:58.190> the<00:01:58.250> steering<00:01:58.519> wheel<00:01:58.700> and

00:01:59.589 --> 00:01:59.599 
going towards the steering wheel and

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:00.880 
going towards the steering wheel and
there's<00:01:59.840> one<00:02:00.019> away<00:02:00.229> from<00:02:00.379> the<00:02:00.470> steering<00:02:00.679> wheel

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
there's one away from the steering wheel

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.190 
there's one away from the steering wheel
just<00:02:01.209> like<00:02:02.209> a<00:02:02.239> standard<00:02:02.450> h-pattern

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
just like a standard h-pattern

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.949 
just like a standard h-pattern
except<00:02:03.709> for<00:02:03.860> being<00:02:04.099> horizontal<00:02:04.959> it's

00:02:05.949 --> 00:02:05.959 
except for being horizontal it's

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:09.279 
except for being horizontal it's
vertical<00:02:06.340> so<00:02:07.340> towards<00:02:07.610> the<00:02:07.700> wheel<00:02:08.140> up<00:02:09.140> is
