so<00:02:10.650> let's<00:02:11.280> take<00:02:11.370> another<00:02:11.430> look<00:02:11.820> and<00:02:12.030> let's

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
so let's take another look and let's

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.380 
so let's take another look and let's
slow<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.390> down<00:02:12.540> here's<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.680> shot<00:02:14.150> it<00:02:15.150> does

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
slow it down here's the shot it does

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.710 
slow it down here's the shot it does
appear<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:16.170> deflect<00:02:16.620> off<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.160> arms<00:02:17.720> doesn't

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
appear to deflect off the arms doesn't

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.790 
appear to deflect off the arms doesn't
look<00:02:18.840> at<00:02:18.900> texture<00:02:19.230> looks<00:02:19.410> like<00:02:19.530> she's<00:02:19.650> just

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
look at texture looks like she's just

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.890 
look at texture looks like she's just
defending<00:02:20.190> her<00:02:20.310> face<00:02:20.550> but<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.120> does<00:02:21.360> alter<00:02:21.810> the

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
defending her face but it does alter the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.860 
defending her face but it does alter the
shot<00:02:22.110> so<00:02:23.030> that's<00:02:24.030> kind<00:02:24.300> of<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.450> risk<00:02:24.600> you<00:02:24.690> take

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
shot so that's kind of the risk you take

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.790 
shot so that's kind of the risk you take
when<00:02:25.110> your<00:02:25.260> arms<00:02:25.440> go<00:02:25.560> up<00:02:25.680> there<00:02:25.860> in<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.040> box<00:02:26.270> so

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
when your arms go up there in the box so

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.050 
when your arms go up there in the box so
