00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.100
 guys and girls welcome to the channel 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.680
 rugby that today I bring you 3 kubes that 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:10.970
 I recommend the first for three reasons 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:13.880
 is going to be by originality and is this is 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:17.630
 mister came cube the second is going to be 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.660
 by appearance is this Mr. moi 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.449
 yunlong stickers them transparent 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:27.009
 etcetera and the third will be for 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:30.439
 price and it's mister colleague without show 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:32.149
 let's see first the wine forgiveness and 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.969
 then we will go to the next ones 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:37.579
 wine cube of brand mc 8 is a cube 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:40.609
 created by calvin and has been commercialized 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:43.309
 by the f8 again is a cube that the 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:45.379
 I really seems very original in terms 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.660
 to the movement but you see it that way and 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.059
 ignore this is a pyramid so good 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.200
 a pyong ming but hey and you put it on 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.120
 a cube that 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.040
 As you know, this cube has evolutions 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.100
 it has no evolutions until it reaches 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.600
 forgiveness helicopter and that bucket to the 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.060
 I can never really solve it because 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.800
 he has never had one so here I have 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.870
 this wine to start solving it and 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.390
 get a little bit into the world of 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.090
 cubes that are not all cubic not in 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.250
 plan as a 3 by 3 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.530
 the spira tinas reminds me a lot 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.570
 those of the size of the normal 3 there 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.850
 but well, not an impediment to 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.170
 the cube itself because hey great we 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.149
 had severe here you can adjust the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.710
 cube is worth it although I do not recommend it for 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:30.740
 course the pieces that I realize that 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.450
 It is removed very easily but good 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:37.050
 and it is also put as output by 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:40.400
 course we are going to undo the one left 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.400
 I'm afraid of the group to pass 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.869
 well that's how it would look like or more 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.409
 except the broken cube as you can see 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.259
 a ski in the type d 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.119
 the clutter that gets caught but good 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.670
 have to look at it and you have to give it now yes and 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.009
 look how you play first that you 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.979
 I recommend for originality guys the 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.530
 dino covers aesthetics or appearance this 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.420
 played is a great cube not only for its 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.579
 appearance stretches as I tell you the color 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.799
 it's beauty because we're going to stickers 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:11.319
 but hey it looks great not contrast 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:13.750
 besides you see this yellow and you say hey 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:18.239
 it looks green but then you turn and say 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.239
 not the green is this and it shows 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:25.410
 it's a cube that apart from being that way it turns 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.140
 be 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.040
 but insisting that this is the best 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.409
 I've tried found speed 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.150
 equity is too fast for me and 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:39.459
 I had to adjust what I'm going to leave like that 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.890
 this cube as I tell you can be solved 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.379
 obviously with speed but good I do not 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.140
 I thought as to more or less 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.819
 collection appearance and in itself is that the 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.380
 charm that has I could not help it 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.120
 when you buy the truth 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.960
 another thing that I really like about the cube 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.420
 the corners of all speed cubes 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.240
 I tended but I liked it very much 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.180
 the price and that is a cheap combo 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.550
 I think that around the 5 homes can be 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.940
 about three and a half euros something like that 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:13.250
 well he hears with that money this bucket was 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.780
 great can you see with speed vale let's go 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.850
 to solve it so you can see that you can 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.130
 but they were moments in which 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.510
 you have to see the pieces and for example 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.640
 and now I'm seeing this piece 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.710
 of nowhere where it will not find it 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.240
 Nowhere are these kinds of things 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.680
 I say that what land in a 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.600
 little bit more at the beginning because it says is 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.790
 pussy where the fuck will it be to me 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.840
 bet with the lighting because it would not be 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.849
 well worth it 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.060
 let's see then it would be solved with a 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.680
 three by three evidently but 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.209
 the peculiarity forgiveness that has this 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.450
 difficulty as I say to recognize the 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:49.550
 colors since being transparent is 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.550
 transparent redundancy 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.099
 for here 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:00.330
 I would like to know the case and voltor 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.310
 finished 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.320
 Well, guys, I recommend it a lot 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.300
 you will decide if you want to buy it 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.330
 but hey for the price that I have the 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.590
 I would not think twice last 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.820
 cube price quality 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.590
 the good 4x4 sensor I know there are people who 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.690
 You have this cube and you will also have 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.820
 following that will have come out but this 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.270
 cube you can not deny me that it is the cube 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.530
 cheaper with better quality by 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.680
 course if you want to this much more 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.840
 money how to spend three buckets of this 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.790
 you can buy the phone that I have 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.520
 here which by the way I have to do 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:38.729
 a review because you told me this 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.939
 cube let's look at it because it's 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:46.229
 the mountains for three feels like before 

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:48.559
 for three this party also but which 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:51.779
 is the problem is cube locks 

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:54.240
 has thousands of blocks but not the 

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:56.520
 problems because this top let's say I've 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:00.800
 made for you to enjoy the cubes 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:03.659
 and it is not so good to do good scripts 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.729
 me this cube for six floors that is 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:07.830
 totally not already has been the problems 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:09.809
 the turns but yes that is customary 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.849
 little that you do not know what you can have 

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:13.559
 the whole turns but I'm 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:15.300
 used to using this cube then 

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:16.499
 three turns because I do not make them whole 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.419
 because I can cut a little bit of 

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:20.419
 corners and not only is both 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.660
 this is a different level not for that 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.430
 I recommend this cube that I think is 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.640
 for five dollars something like that I repeat 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.230
 it's like three and a half euros and it deserves 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.320
 It's a shame because the truth is if you want a 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:37.320
 Cheap 4x4 that turns well if it is used 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.360
 for spirit to also want to be 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.490
 for fun whatever this cube is 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.290
 your without doubt without media comments 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.370
 which cube of the three you liked most and 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.630
 you are bought in some also by 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.670
 supposedly December no 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.230
 problem if you have any questions you can 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.310
 mention me on twitter or ask to 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.930
 the comments to which surely 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.090
 simple mentions on twitter the mind 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.920
 be with more security nothing else I hope 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.900
 that you liked it and if so, they left 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.920
 like see you in the next video 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.920
 lovers of the comic
