00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:16.279
 Front case announced 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.279
 Miyagi radar goes to the top 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.339
 According to the manual, Cheng is hooked to the outer ring 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:25.140
 Pin up 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.140
 Let's check if it's off the leaves 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:34.010
 The length linked from here is the appropriate length 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.380
 It has become 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.510
 Because the place of the red circle is fine 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.360
 Where is the link from here? 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.190
 If the correct answer is how to count in the green area, the city Rinkai 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.940
 Count as Familink 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.990
 How about this case 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.320
 One ring chrysanthemum link so I should be good at the point of hero 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.060
 but 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.230
 It is with these, but can not be regarded as this 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.510
 As a result, one more link and cutting at the green point is 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.040
 It will be correct 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.950
 1. 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.070
 Unnecessary important 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.540
 Let's cut with jet 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.090
 There was more 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.750
 It hurts the link if you push the pin without getting tight enough 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.610
 It will be the end of the first volume 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.740
 Let's be careful enough as it will shift during work 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.580
 Links are prepared for changes in production locations 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.380
 As we can not use Narita flight, we discard 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.790
 We have released movies at the front desk all year round 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.690
 let's go 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.690
 It is assumed that the outer 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.380
 Substance 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.670
 Note that this grape from Iwate Horse Racing and its easy to climb 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.190
 let's do it 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.210
 This is with the wrong investor 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.670
 Western Europe modern gear in the sky to insert unpretty increasingly 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.670
 It was hard and I will push it down 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:14.189
 Together 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:31.710
 If you come to the same position as the next flight 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.059
 Let's get rid of the chain 

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:38.180
 The tip of the ap is unnecessary, so it is thrown away and discarded 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.179
 Let's check if the connected place moves smoothly next 

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:48.059
 It's ok if you move as much as other links 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:52.939
 It's about the same for both sides 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.029
 If the left and right are not even with the chain cutter 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:03:00.029
 It is fine adjustment 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:05.319
 I went back to the Chekhov ring and confirmed it. 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.729
 If you play really radar every day and hit your shoulder 

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:13.059
 Not led by Western Europe 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:15.549
 Remove the pulley bolt and let's put in a year again
