00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
there I'm almost certain of it a lot of

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.020 
there I'm almost certain of it a lot of
large<00:03:09.510> fund<00:03:09.810> companies<00:03:10.440> use<00:03:10.709> them<00:03:11.310> never<00:03:11.820> mind

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
large fund companies use them never mind

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.360 
large fund companies use them never mind
the<00:03:12.120> big<00:03:12.299> four<00:03:12.570> but<00:03:13.080> there's<00:03:13.380> the<00:03:13.590> second<00:03:14.220> tier

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370
