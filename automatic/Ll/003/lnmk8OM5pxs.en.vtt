00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
right around 80 80 to emily kick-start

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.940 
right around 80 80 to emily kick-start
some<00:02:41.489> if<00:02:41.670> you<00:02:42.170> if<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.290> run<00:02:43.470> them<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.620> little<00:02:43.769> bit

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
some if you if you run them a little bit

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.699 
some if you if you run them a little bit
cooler<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.909> tank<00:02:45.209> like<00:02:45.420> say<00:02:45.659> 76<00:02:46.379> right

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
cooler and a tank like say 76 right

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.530 
cooler and a tank like say 76 right
around<00:02:46.890> there<00:02:47.159> I<00:02:47.340> tend<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.060> chill<00:02:48.360> out<00:02:48.510> a

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
around there I tend to chill out a

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.059 
around there I tend to chill out a
little<00:02:48.750> more<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.110> they<00:02:49.230> aren't<00:02:49.379> so<00:02:49.590> intrigued

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
little more and they aren't so intrigued

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.990 
little more and they aren't so intrigued
by<00:02:50.340> each<00:02:50.489> other<00:02:52.190> my<00:02:53.190> guess<00:02:53.400> would<00:02:53.489> be<00:02:53.610> that's<00:02:53.879> a

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
by each other my guess would be that's a

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.520 
by each other my guess would be that's a
seasonal<00:02:54.480> thing<00:02:54.510> or<00:02:54.930> something<00:02:55.170> I<00:02:55.409> know

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
seasonal thing or something I know

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.610 
seasonal thing or something I know
she'll<00:02:56.519> probably<00:02:56.730> go<00:02:57.000> look<00:02:57.209> that<00:02:57.360> up<00:02:57.420> before<00:02:58.409> I

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
she'll probably go look that up before I

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.580 
she'll probably go look that up before I
talk<00:02:58.890> about<00:02:59.160> it<00:02:59.690> so<00:03:00.690> not<00:03:00.840> sound<00:03:01.080> like<00:03:01.140> such<00:03:01.440> an

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
talk about it so not sound like such an

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.440 
talk about it so not sound like such an
idiot<00:03:01.680> but

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
idiot but

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.760 
idiot but
yeah<00:03:04.450> a<00:03:04.690> little<00:03:04.990> bit<00:03:05.080> higher<00:03:05.260> temperature

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
yeah a little bit higher temperature

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.320 
yeah a little bit higher temperature
like<00:03:05.950> that<00:03:06.190> gets<00:03:06.400> their<00:03:06.520> metabolism<00:03:07.180> going

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
like that gets their metabolism going

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.820 
like that gets their metabolism going
get<00:03:07.810> to<00:03:07.959> meet<00:03:08.140> and<00:03:08.319> get<00:03:08.650> some<00:03:08.800> ready<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.100> breed

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
get to meet and get some ready to breed

stand here hey how much wasted space i

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.379 
stand here hey how much wasted space i
have<00:05:17.139> on<00:05:17.290> the<00:05:17.380> stand<00:05:17.680> it's<00:05:17.860> like<00:05:18.270> six<00:05:19.270> inches

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:19.389 
have on the stand it's like six inches

here you know over a foot right in the

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.680 
here you know over a foot right in the
middle<00:05:23.650> and<00:05:23.950> there's<00:05:24.130> crap<00:05:25.120> accumulated

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
middle and there's crap accumulated

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.140 
middle and there's crap accumulated
there<00:05:25.960> and<00:05:26.290> then<00:05:27.070> another<00:05:27.280> six<00:05:27.610> is<00:05:27.820> like<00:05:27.970> two

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
there and then another six is like two

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.560 
there and then another six is like two
feet<00:05:28.360> at<00:05:28.540> space<00:05:29.440> and<00:05:29.770> I<00:05:29.830> could<00:05:30.419> easily<00:05:31.419> make

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
feet at space and I could easily make

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.340 
feet at space and I could easily make
use<00:05:31.840> of<00:05:32.010> and<00:05:33.090> the<00:05:34.090> inefficient<00:05:34.690> setup<00:05:35.080> of<00:05:35.230> how

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
use of and the inefficient setup of how

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.110 
use of and the inefficient setup of how
I<00:05:35.380> built<00:05:35.740> this<00:05:35.919> this<00:05:36.130> is<00:05:36.310> the<00:05:36.460> stupidest<00:05:36.940> thing

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
I built this this is the stupidest thing

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.090 
I built this this is the stupidest thing
but<00:05:37.630> you<00:05:37.930> know<00:05:38.050> if<00:05:38.290> you<00:05:38.380> guys<00:05:38.470> remember<00:05:38.530> I<00:05:38.919> was

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
but you know if you guys remember I was

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
but you know if you guys remember I was
salvaging<00:05:39.639> these<00:05:41.130> plywood<00:05:42.130> boxes<00:05:42.610> that<00:05:42.880> i<00:05:42.910> got

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
salvaging these plywood boxes that i got

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.730 
salvaging these plywood boxes that i got
for<00:05:43.330> free<00:05:43.389> you<00:05:44.080> know<00:05:44.200> there's<00:05:44.410> one<00:05:44.590> up<00:05:44.710> there

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
for free you know there's one up there

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.700 
for free you know there's one up there
like<00:05:45.340> that<00:05:45.660> so<00:05:46.660> that's<00:05:46.840> why<00:05:46.990> I'm<00:05:47.169> the<00:05:47.380> building

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
like that so that's why I'm the building

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.409 
like that so that's why I'm the building
stands<00:05:48.010> like<00:05:48.160> this<00:05:48.370> but<00:05:48.610> it's<00:05:49.120> going<00:05:49.240> to<00:05:49.300> get

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419 
stands like this but it's going to get

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:52.500 
stands like this but it's going to get
rebuilt<00:05:50.160> and<00:05:51.160> I<00:05:51.280> think<00:05:51.610> fairly<00:05:51.880> soon<00:05:52.240> because

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510 
rebuilt and I think fairly soon because

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.600 
rebuilt and I think fairly soon because
I<00:05:52.600> want<00:05:52.750> to<00:05:52.810> move<00:05:52.960> these<00:05:53.139> tanks<00:05:53.680> i<00:05:53.889> think<00:05:54.520> i'm

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
I want to move these tanks i think i'm

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:00.240 
I want to move these tanks i think i'm
gonna<00:05:54.669> move<00:05:54.880> this<00:05:54.940> in<00:05:55.450> this<00:05:56.669> down<00:05:57.669> there<00:05:59.250> these

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
gonna move this in this down there these

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.980 
gonna move this in this down there these
two<00:06:00.430> tanks<00:06:01.050> down<00:06:02.050> there<00:06:03.270> so<00:06:04.270> kind<00:06:04.510> of<00:06:04.570> match<00:06:04.750> up

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
two tanks down there so kind of match up

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.570 
two tanks down there so kind of match up
with<00:06:05.139> that<00:06:05.380> but<00:06:06.130> i<00:06:06.190> think<00:06:06.340> i'm<00:06:06.400> going<00:06:06.490> to

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
with that but i think i'm going to

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.300 
with that but i think i'm going to
rebuild<00:06:06.880> this<00:06:07.870> whole<00:06:07.930> thing<00:06:08.470> or<00:06:08.950> I<00:06:09.040> might<00:06:09.190> just

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
rebuild this whole thing or I might just

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.670 
rebuild this whole thing or I might just
use<00:06:09.460> this<00:06:09.639> and<00:06:09.820> move<00:06:09.940> it<00:06:10.090> down<00:06:10.120> here<00:06:10.510> I'm<00:06:11.470> I

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
use this and move it down here I'm I

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.129 
use this and move it down here I'm I
rebuild<00:06:12.040> this<00:06:12.220> so<00:06:12.430> it's<00:06:12.580> legit<00:06:13.479> sort<00:06:14.020> of<00:06:14.080> how

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:14.139 
rebuild this so it's legit sort of how

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:17.880 
rebuild this so it's legit sort of how
this<00:06:14.290> one<00:06:14.500> is<00:06:14.590> built<00:06:14.800> over<00:06:15.010> here<00:06:16.590> I'm<00:06:17.590> put<00:06:17.800> it

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:17.890 
this one is built over here I'm put it

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.260 
this one is built over here I'm put it
and<00:06:18.039> slide<00:06:18.280> it<00:06:18.310> right<00:06:18.430> in<00:06:18.640> there<00:06:18.789> so<00:06:19.060> there'll

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270 
and slide it right in there so there'll

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.260 
and slide it right in there so there'll
be<00:06:19.500> two<00:06:20.500> tanks<00:06:20.800> over<00:06:20.890> there<00:06:21.039> two<00:06:21.580> tanks<00:06:21.910> facing

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
be two tanks over there two tanks facing

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.120 
be two tanks over there two tanks facing
over<00:06:22.479> there<00:06:22.690> and<00:06:22.990> then<00:06:23.200> the<00:06:23.320> big<00:06:23.530> piece<00:06:23.860> in<00:06:24.039> the

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.130 
over there and then the big piece in the

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:27.659 
over there and then the big piece in the
middle<00:06:24.930> and<00:06:25.930> I<00:06:26.680> think<00:06:26.919> that<00:06:27.039> will<00:06:27.100> flow<00:06:27.400> real

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:27.669 
middle and I think that will flow real

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:29.190 
middle and I think that will flow real
well<00:06:27.880> and<00:06:27.910> then<00:06:28.210> I<00:06:28.300> can<00:06:28.479> just<00:06:28.510> move<00:06:28.780> all<00:06:28.990> the

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:29.200 
well and then I can just move all the

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.560 
well and then I can just move all the
all<00:06:29.470> these<00:06:29.650> grow<00:06:29.890> tanks<00:06:30.250> right<00:06:30.400> here<00:06:30.700> so<00:06:31.419> I<00:06:31.450> can

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:31.570 
all these grow tanks right here so I can

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.719 
all these grow tanks right here so I can
just<00:06:31.720> mess<00:06:31.930> with<00:06:31.960> them<00:06:32.200> and<00:06:32.440> not<00:06:33.130> have<00:06:33.190> to<00:06:33.550> dig

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:33.729 
just mess with them and not have to dig

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:36.409 
just mess with them and not have to dig
around<00:06:33.850> and<00:06:34.330> then<00:06:34.510> the<00:06:34.660> 240's<00:06:35.289> will<00:06:35.650> be<00:06:35.770> there

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419 
around and then the 240's will be there

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:39.590 
around and then the 240's will be there
the<00:06:37.419> tiger<00:06:37.810> n<00:06:37.930> blurs<00:06:38.140> are<00:06:38.350> going<00:06:38.590> in<00:06:38.710> one<00:06:38.950> and

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 
the tiger n blurs are going in one and

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.800 
the tiger n blurs are going in one and
then<00:06:40.600> undecided<00:06:41.350> but<00:06:41.590> probably<00:06:42.810> cherry

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:43.810 
then undecided but probably cherry

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:45.930 
then undecided but probably cherry
shrimp<00:06:43.990> colony<00:06:44.470> or<00:06:44.500> crystal<00:06:45.370> shrimp<00:06:45.610> i<00:06:45.760> think

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.100 
shrimp colony or crystal shrimp i think
i'm<00:06:46.000> going<00:06:46.120> to<00:06:46.210> do<00:06:46.300> personal<00:06:46.510> shrimp<00:06:46.900> just

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.110 
i'm going to do personal shrimp just

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.100 
i'm going to do personal shrimp just
because<00:06:47.380> that<00:06:47.650> it's<00:06:48.340> a<00:06:48.400> good<00:06:48.520> little<00:06:49.080> it's<00:06:50.080> a
