00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:03.880
 there 

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.880
 there 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.709
 the jubilation Commerce or 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:13.139
 Google Street View has finally come to Germany has the 20 largest 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.609
 Cities now exist online 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:16.830
 and who 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.830
 I know what the outcast cities are like me 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.439
 can the 4 on Google Maps just look 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.499
 somehow superformance no 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:30.699
 So the city of Dassow Winter is already Hamburg 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.079
 then Bremen and the surrounding area Berlin, of course, belongs to Hannover Bielefeld 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.280
 the Ruhr area are in addition to food what you can see here also Dortmund 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.220
 and Bochum and 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.450
 Oberhausen 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.370
 and not only that 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.640
 while Natick first and bookings Oberhausen Duisburg Ratingen 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.210
 Dusseldorf Wuppertal 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.870
 here and now we want to be able to go further outside 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.120
 Ruhr 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.800
 I would like to get out again then Frankfurt am Main the area Mannheim 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.260
 Stuttgart Augsburg now Werkes thereby remains Dresden around it still 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
 and also Freiburg 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.440
 the whole cities are now available on Google Street View and we 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.440
 look at the whole now how it looks in Belgium 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.620
 I've already prepared that, so to speak 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.960
 in fact 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.960
 quite normal under Maps just once gone to Berlin 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.400
 and also the satellite view and if you like it because of it 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.310
 "It's not possible anymore" 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.680
 then you come in automatically 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.160
 I'm at war 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.160
 they should be comfortable fast what can you change 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.259
 such a 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.830
 Another possibility is you can take this little figure that you just see 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.490
 and we draw from it 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.890
 and then showed a bogey 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.540
 will stand 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.590
 Pose Novartis Men 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.590
 then we will come back again 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.120
 and here it can turn or just move if you are currently 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.560
 you move that 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.660
 you see 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.509
 we at these persons 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.669
 and that this facial veiling Google has not always announced 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:16.989
 well just worked if the person not on the sidewalk sense but on 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.059
 the street as in this case 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:20.399
 recognizes 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:23.519
 Google just not 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.619
 So it will not be so in the top 20 

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:30.299
 but personally it does not bother that much and Feint one sees a lot 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.979
 a lot of fuss made super 

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:35.019
 over the whole s5j fairer 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.040
 but whoever is bothered by this finds Wagner still provokes excitement 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.719
 can 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:45.149
 Jacob's nice on the computer is it when you're here in this case is this circle 

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:47.879
 indicates where to stand next time for example if I am now 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.269
 the circle after the game 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.269
 a lot of money Fox maybe up here 

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:03.399
 so i can cool myself Jung now i can now pile up the road ranking 

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:06.399
 and then I fell into this street 

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:10.679
 what I can do is of course the coward and then I always go 

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:13.679
 until the next photo 

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:17.559
 This is a bit of a hassle that was much more pleasant 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.819
 but come play in it until the next crossing 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.859
 and I can also judge that success then sees the group square Niko gig 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.919
 in the direction of this house that replaces eye-catching Paktika 

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:34.599
 Zoom in on this house and maybe with a view of the wall 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:42.919
 That's how I went out again, but that was all I showed you 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:44.549
 so wanted that out 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.540
 And now, of course, it comes to the same as a woman's 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.499
 on the iPad I now have just the example iPad on the iPhone 

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:54.499
 works the same way or iPod Touch 

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:58.839
 urban planners 

00:03:58.839 --> 00:04:01.839
 so now to reach the Strache we are now in the 

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:05.499
 that in a time in the barren application 

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:09.529
 and nice felt to arrive click easy 

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:12.529
 Prof and burst threatens until then comes in this situation 

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:16.189
 and now we have the possibilities in the 4 

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:19.189
 to look at and click here to acknowledge 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.430
 Fox suppressed 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.729
 and if you look down directly you will see such a little hangover 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.069
 or will be out at the CeBIT again 

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:31.309
 one also has the possibility of the countries arrived is a device that 

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:34.309
 best to give as you left this small business 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:37.379
 press and then you are right back 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:40.050
 in game four goals 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.979
 and you can also be very fluent very fast as a natural 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.129
 what you can not do 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:51.249
 this is in this circle drag with the mouse 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:54.649
 where you go in then you have to scroll picture by picture 

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:59.520
 Insider knows LED relatively fast 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.949
 then it started firmly and 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:04.949
 now the picture is supposed to cloud 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.400
 So it's quite common 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.400
 the man is the world another sees their parents bit but 

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:15.999
 but ultimately it's not about that impossible 

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:18.999
 because it is wrong otherwise it is not fun 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:24.960
 so important outside 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.169
 and she was always here among lovers 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:30.419
 put on the street their means 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:33.180
 and the spent 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.180
 we are here 

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:40.289
 that's really on the way 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:42.069
 Percent very pleasant 

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:43.110
 for the winner 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.110
 sometimes it takes a bit of loading 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:49.300
 it is still relatively fast 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.979
 Here you can see now on my bike where it worked with the 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:53.120
 face recognition 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.529
 that disguise the face or you can not read it 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:59.869
 that's how it should always be, it's not 

00:05:59.869 --> 00:06:01.819
 but 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:04.819
 who should control everything? 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.350
 There are not four times enough people to get through all the photos there 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:12.770
 So it would automatically stand that there will be problems when it is clear 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.439
 that does not still work pretty well 

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:18.439
 well i hope you liked a little insight into Street View 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.939
 and the movie is good, close the end
