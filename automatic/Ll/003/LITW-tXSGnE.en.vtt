00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:07.689 
do a full episode I just thought I would

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:10.250 
do a full episode I just thought I would
give<00:00:07.960> you<00:00:08.080> a<00:00:08.109> warning<00:00:08.590> about<00:00:08.830> redwood<00:00:09.370> trees<00:00:09.730> I

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
give you a warning about redwood trees I

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.870 
give you a warning about redwood trees I
thought<00:00:11.260> it<00:00:11.380> would<00:00:11.500> be<00:00:11.620> cool<00:00:11.830> to<00:00:11.860> grow<00:00:12.220> one<00:00:12.490> on

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:12.880 
thought it would be cool to grow one on

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.970 
thought it would be cool to grow one on
top<00:00:13.570> of<00:00:13.750> my<00:00:13.870> base<00:00:15.180> so<00:00:16.180> I<00:00:16.209> did<00:00:16.539> it<00:00:17.320> takes<00:00:17.590> seven

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980 
top of my base so I did it takes seven

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.569 
top of my base so I did it takes seven
by<00:00:18.130> seven<00:00:18.579> with<00:00:18.789> redwood<00:00:19.119> saplings<00:00:20.579> the

00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:21.579 
by seven with redwood saplings the

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:24.029 
by seven with redwood saplings the
problem<00:00:22.060> with<00:00:22.210> this<00:00:22.359> is<00:00:22.659> that<00:00:23.109> redwood<00:00:23.710> trees

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.039 
problem with this is that redwood trees

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.210 
problem with this is that redwood trees
have<00:00:24.369> roots<00:00:24.400> and<00:00:25.210> they<00:00:25.810> grew<00:00:26.079> down<00:00:26.320> into<00:00:27.009> the

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
have roots and they grew down into the

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.290 
have roots and they grew down into the
base<00:00:27.400> and<00:00:28.650> whatever<00:00:29.650> is<00:00:29.980> in<00:00:30.189> their<00:00:30.369> way<00:00:30.550> will

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
base and whatever is in their way will

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.150 
base and whatever is in their way will
get<00:00:31.539> destroyed<00:00:33.810> so<00:00:34.810> as<00:00:35.020> you<00:00:35.230> can<00:00:35.380> see<00:00:35.680> we've

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
get destroyed so as you can see we've

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.740 
get destroyed so as you can see we've
got<00:00:36.190> all<00:00:36.820> the<00:00:37.030> redwood<00:00:37.420> roots<00:00:37.750> down<00:00:38.020> here<00:00:38.460> and

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
got all the redwood roots down here and

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.320 
got all the redwood roots down here and
they<00:00:40.750> grew<00:00:41.170> through<00:00:41.800> the<00:00:42.520> barrels<00:00:42.970> the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.330 
they grew through the barrels the

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.780 
they grew through the barrels the
insertion<00:00:44.290> pipes<00:00:44.710> that<00:00:45.070> were<00:00:45.190> on<00:00:45.340> top<00:00:45.550> of<00:00:45.610> the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
insertion pipes that were on top of the

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.100 
insertion pipes that were on top of the
barrels<00:00:46.240> and<00:00:48.090> messed<00:00:49.090> everything<00:00:49.270> up

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
barrels and messed everything up

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.160 
barrels and messed everything up
I<00:00:50.140> was<00:00:50.980> spewing<00:00:51.550> stuff<00:00:51.850> from<00:00:52.390> the<00:00:52.510> quarry<00:00:52.780> on

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
I was spewing stuff from the quarry on

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.680 
I was spewing stuff from the quarry on
to<00:00:54.160> the<00:00:54.490> ground<00:00:54.760> here<00:00:56.310> and<00:00:57.310> it<00:00:58.150> even<00:00:58.390> went<00:00:58.600> down

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
to the ground here and it even went down

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.259 
to the ground here and it even went down
into<00:00:59.620> the<00:00:59.829> level<00:01:00.010> below<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:02.430> grew<00:01:03.430> into<00:01:03.790> my

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
into the level below and grew into my

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.250 
into the level below and grew into my
iron<00:01:04.479> tank<00:01:05.940> luckily<00:01:06.940> it<00:01:07.210> didn't<00:01:07.510> grow<00:01:07.900> through

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
iron tank luckily it didn't grow through

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.670 
iron tank luckily it didn't grow through
the<00:01:08.380> center<00:01:08.770> block<00:01:09.010> so<00:01:09.780> we<00:01:10.780> won't<00:01:10.990> lose<00:01:11.080> the

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
the center block so we won't lose the

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.160 
the center block so we won't lose the
data<00:01:12.780> it'll<00:01:13.780> it'll<00:01:14.170> remember<00:01:14.590> how<00:01:14.950> much

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
data it'll it'll remember how much

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.950 
data it'll it'll remember how much
biofuel<00:01:17.170> was<00:01:17.350> in<00:01:17.500> here<00:01:17.970> but<00:01:18.970> I<00:01:19.540> had<00:01:20.320> a

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
biofuel was in here but I had a

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.690 
biofuel was in here but I had a
bioreactor<00:01:22.960> right<00:01:23.440> here<00:01:23.800> making<00:01:24.430> more

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
bioreactor right here making more

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.170 
bioreactor right here making more
biofuel<00:01:25.390> and<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:27.670> is<00:01:27.880> just<00:01:28.180> a<00:01:28.300> huge<00:01:28.630> pain<00:01:28.990> so

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
biofuel and this is just a huge pain so

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.800 
biofuel and this is just a huge pain so
beware<00:01:31.180> if<00:01:31.600> you're<00:01:31.780> growing<00:01:32.229> the<00:01:32.350> tree<00:01:33.810> that

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
beware if you're growing the tree that

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.240 
beware if you're growing the tree that
this<00:01:35.140> is<00:01:35.440> a<00:01:36.040> possibility<00:01:37.799> other<00:01:38.799> than<00:01:39.100> that

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
this is a possibility other than that

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.660 
this is a possibility other than that
the<00:01:39.430> trees<00:01:39.700> are<00:01:39.729> really<00:01:40.060> cool<00:01:40.390> but<00:01:41.490> keep<00:01:42.490> in

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
the trees are really cool but keep in

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.410 
the trees are really cool but keep in
mind<00:01:42.700> that<00:01:43.380> if<00:01:44.380> you<00:01:44.590> grow<00:01:44.950> it<00:01:44.979> and<00:01:45.520> I<00:01:45.940> grew<00:01:46.240> it

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
mind that if you grow it and I grew it

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.550 
mind that if you grow it and I grew it
on<00:01:46.630> this<00:01:47.260> level<00:01:47.560> right<00:01:47.860> here<00:01:48.330> as<00:01:49.330> you<00:01:50.200> can<00:01:50.350> see

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
on this level right here as you can see

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.160 
on this level right here as you can see
this<00:01:50.770> is<00:01:51.010> actually<00:01:51.729> bigger<00:01:52.360> than<00:01:52.479> seven<00:01:53.020> by

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
this is actually bigger than seven by

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.430 
this is actually bigger than seven by
seven<00:01:53.820> just<00:01:54.820> make<00:01:55.659> sure<00:01:55.840> to<00:01:55.869> give<00:01:56.140> it<00:01:56.170> plenty

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
seven just make sure to give it plenty

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.370 
seven just make sure to give it plenty
of<00:01:56.619> room<00:01:57.000> because<00:01:58.000> otherwise<00:01:58.420> you<00:01:58.960> might<00:01:59.110> end

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
of room because otherwise you might end

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.050 
of room because otherwise you might end
up<00:01:59.619> in<00:01:59.890> a<00:02:00.220> situation<00:02:00.460> like<00:02:01.180> that<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.880> that's
