it's like if you're doing anything add

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.710 
it's like if you're doing anything add
some<00:00:25.800> slides<00:00:26.130> like<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.580> slide<00:00:28.369> like<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.720> you

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
some slides like the slide like that you

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.250 
some slides like the slide like that you
have<00:00:30.840> it

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.520 

so<00:00:34.980> there's<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.220> lot<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:36.320> noticed<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.410> you

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
so there's a lot of I noticed that you

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.040 
so there's a lot of I noticed that you
can<00:00:37.620> slide<00:00:37.920> off<00:00:38.180> it<00:00:39.180> also<00:00:39.329> makes<00:00:39.720> it<00:00:39.840> sound

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
can slide off it also makes it sound

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.560 
can slide off it also makes it sound
like<00:00:40.680> you're<00:00:41.160> playing<00:00:41.309> like

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570
