00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.069
 advertising culture 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.300
 so me in the north it's very common 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.769

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.120

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.029
 now cameraman quoted with me 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.470
 in contrast to a little beer 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.450
 in my pots and we heat up 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.500
 slowly 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.690
 be careful not a big boil so 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.730
 otherwise the bitterness will be too strong on 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.620
 warms up quietly and has 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:49.950
 nicely little by little I'm going to add 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:51.120
 my little pieces too go match have 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.649
 gently melt the cheese 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.649
 to get a better place 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.530
 go hop my cheese and fondly 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.610
 in my beer I cut fire for 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.610
 keep this sauce smooth 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.110
 that's ready we did the most 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.280
 hard 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.110
 cheese in the beer now we 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.080
 will go get the bread we put in 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.360
 grilling go my cheese and melted in 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.470
 the beer and I'm going to add a nice 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.030
 moutain amount has to be 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.890
 well, well, well, if not, it's not going well 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.560
 at all and we go 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.460
 out of the important fire we will emulsify 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.600
 a little bit this is the mustard going to 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.490
 mix with the whole we make a 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.560
 nice lesson 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.149
 the recipe is finished in a dish that 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.060
 must to the oven 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:47.830
 I have my little toasts I range 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:50.860
 on top of my slice of ham and I'm going 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:54.909
 tablecloth is completely with this 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:58.350
 cheese preparation beers mustard and 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.350

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.229

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.719
 I'll be right back 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.630
 Here is cooked au gratin bread 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:09.729
 to absorb my old cheese sauce 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.230
 backpacker ham is just a small 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.120
 little dried the salt out in the 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.079
 bread has more than to eat of course with 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.079
