very very cool very very cool map um so
it's<00:00:36.660> all<00:00:36.870> based<00:00:37.170> on<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.649> kind<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.480> make

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
it's all based on this kind of make

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.139 
it's all based on this kind of make
believe<00:00:39.660> village<00:00:40.200> where<00:00:40.670> things<00:00:41.670> are<00:00:41.820> powered

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
believe village where things are powered

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.319 
believe village where things are powered
by<00:00:42.180> these<00:00:42.510> huge<00:00:42.809> wheels<00:00:43.110> i<00:00:43.530> suppose<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.430> it

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
by these huge wheels i suppose and it

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.880 
by these huge wheels i suppose and it
sucks<00:00:45.539> on<00:00:45.719> cliffs<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.289> everything's<00:00:46.649> really

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
sucks on cliffs and everything's really

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.990

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
cool they have these hot-air balloons

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.500 
cool they have these hot-air balloons
everything<00:00:51.000> looks<00:00:51.300> pretty<00:00:51.750> sick<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:53.510> there's

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
everything looks pretty sick and there's

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.569 
everything looks pretty sick and there's
really<00:00:54.629> nothing<00:00:54.989> else<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.230> describe<00:00:55.590> how<00:00:56.309> cool

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
really nothing else to describe how cool

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.250 
really nothing else to describe how cool
it<00:00:56.699> looks<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:57.539> there's<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.780> ton<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.079> these

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
it looks so there's a ton of these

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.709 
it looks so there's a ton of these
houses<00:00:58.859> on<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.670> side<00:00:59.910> of<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.120> mountain<00:01:00.180> it

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
houses on the side of this mountain it

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.330 
houses on the side of this mountain it
looks<00:01:00.960> awesome<00:01:01.109> there's<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:01.620> huge<00:01:01.890> bridge

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
looks awesome there's this huge bridge

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.600 
looks awesome there's this huge bridge
but<00:01:03.000> i<00:01:03.030> think<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.390> main<00:01:03.660> feature<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:05.280> is

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
but i think the main feature of this is

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.060 
but i think the main feature of this is
definitely<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.380> circle<00:01:07.380> wheel<00:01:07.590> thing<00:01:07.920> with

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
definitely this circle wheel thing with

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.800 
definitely this circle wheel thing with
water<00:01:08.340> it's<00:01:08.580> awesome<00:01:08.970> it's<00:01:09.150> just<00:01:09.240> awesome<00:01:09.720> you
