cards from their hand you're gonna have

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.580 
cards from their hand you're gonna have
four<00:02:21.819> cards<00:02:22.150> in<00:02:22.180> your<00:02:22.299> hand<00:02:22.720> and<00:02:22.989> these<00:02:23.110> cards

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
four cards in your hand and these cards

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.250 
four cards in your hand and these cards
are<00:02:23.860> all<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:24.610> same

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
are all the same

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.199 
are all the same
basically<00:02:26.260> they<00:02:26.530> show<00:02:26.799> one<00:02:27.340> of<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.970> nine

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
basically they show one of the nine

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.720 
basically they show one of the nine
spots<00:02:28.720> on<00:02:29.049> a<00:02:29.079> grid<00:02:29.380> when<00:02:29.530> you<00:02:29.650> play<00:02:29.829> then<00:02:30.070> when

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
spots on a grid when you play then when

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.039 
spots on a grid when you play then when
you<00:02:30.850> play<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.030> card<00:02:31.360> you<00:02:31.510> play<00:02:31.690> it<00:02:31.810> face<00:02:32.019> up

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
you play a card you play it face up

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.410 
you play a card you play it face up
against<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.560> board<00:02:32.799> so<00:02:33.400> my<00:02:33.760> direction<00:02:34.090> might

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
against the board so my direction might

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.940 
against the board so my direction might
will<00:02:34.630> be<00:02:34.750> different<00:02:35.140> than<00:02:35.350> yours<00:02:35.620> if<00:02:35.799> you're

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
will be different than yours if you're

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.160 
will be different than yours if you're
across<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:36.370> board<00:02:36.579> for<00:02:36.700> me<00:02:36.880> but<00:02:37.720> this<00:02:37.840> lets<00:02:38.049> me

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
across the board for me but this lets me

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.250 
across the board for me but this lets me
put<00:02:38.380> a<00:02:38.410> tower<00:02:38.739> in<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:40.000> upper<00:02:40.420> middle<00:02:40.720> spot<00:02:41.019> of

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
put a tower in the upper middle spot of

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.680 
put a tower in the upper middle spot of
any<00:02:41.530> of<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.799> cities<00:02:42.010> so<00:02:42.549> I<00:02:42.790> could<00:02:43.329> put<00:02:43.450> a<00:02:43.480> tower

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
any of the cities so I could put a tower

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.380 
any of the cities so I could put a tower
here<00:02:44.079> I<00:02:44.290> could<00:02:44.950> put<00:02:45.070> the<00:02:45.130> tower<00:02:45.340> here<00:02:45.760> I<00:02:45.940> could

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
here I could put the tower here I could

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.420 
here I could put the tower here I could
put<00:02:46.510> a<00:02:46.540> tower<00:02:46.750> here<00:02:47.260> I<00:02:47.470> like<00:02:47.859> to<00:02:47.980> put<00:02:48.100> a<00:02:48.130> tower

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
put a tower here I like to put a tower

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.660 
put a tower here I like to put a tower
here<00:02:48.609> etc<00:02:49.560> now<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.950> rules<00:02:51.130> for<00:02:51.310> towers<00:02:51.579> are

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
here etc now the rules for towers are

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.370 
here etc now the rules for towers are
pretty<00:02:51.850> simple<00:02:52.150> if<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.299> spots<00:02:52.570> and<00:02:52.810> eco<00:02:53.079> I<00:02:53.170> put

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
pretty simple if the spots and eco I put

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.530 
pretty simple if the spots and eco I put
a<00:02:53.410> tower<00:02:53.620> there<00:02:53.950> if<00:02:54.220> there<00:02:54.790> already<00:02:55.000> is<00:02:55.269> a

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
a tower there if there already is a

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.530 
a tower there if there already is a
tower<00:02:55.840> in<00:02:56.140> a<00:02:56.260> spot<00:02:56.590> then<00:02:57.519> you<00:02:57.910> are<00:02:58.150> allowed<00:02:58.510> to

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
tower in a spot then you are allowed to

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.630 
tower in a spot then you are allowed to
put<00:02:58.750> your<00:02:58.989> tower<00:02:59.200> on<00:02:59.410> top<00:02:59.650> of<00:02:59.829> it<00:02:59.950> as<00:03:00.100> long<00:03:00.609> as

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
put your tower on top of it as long as

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.789 
put your tower on top of it as long as
the<00:03:01.540> number<00:03:01.780> of<00:03:01.810> fours<00:03:02.109> you<00:03:02.380> have<00:03:02.590> in<00:03:02.739> the

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
the number of fours you have in the

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.220 
the number of fours you have in the
building<00:03:02.980> is<00:03:03.250> equal<00:03:03.790> to<00:03:04.000> or<00:03:04.239> greater<00:03:04.299> than<00:03:05.079> a

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
building is equal to or greater than a

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.960 
building is equal to or greater than a
metaphor<00:03:05.920> someone<00:03:06.430> else<00:03:06.579> has<00:03:06.760> in<00:03:06.880> the

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
metaphor someone else has in the

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.270 
metaphor someone else has in the
building<00:03:07.269> so<00:03:08.170> for<00:03:08.380> example<00:03:08.799> if<00:03:08.859> this<00:03:08.980> blue

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
building so for example if this blue

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.610 
building so for example if this blue
double<00:03:09.730> level<00:03:10.060> had<00:03:10.239> been<00:03:10.450> there<00:03:10.690> I<00:03:10.900> could<00:03:11.470> not

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
double level had been there I could not

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.470 
double level had been there I could not
put<00:03:11.859> a<00:03:11.890> single<00:03:12.160> level<00:03:12.400> black<00:03:12.670> there<00:03:13.030> on<00:03:13.209> top

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
put a single level black there on top

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.900 
put a single level black there on top
because<00:03:13.840> there's<00:03:14.680> two<00:03:14.980> blues<00:03:15.310> and<00:03:15.700> I<00:03:15.760> would

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
because there's two blues and I would

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.090 
because there's two blues and I would
need<00:03:16.060> to<00:03:16.120> put<00:03:16.239> at<00:03:16.329> least<00:03:16.390> two<00:03:16.600> blacks<00:03:17.109> but<00:03:18.010> if

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
need to put at least two blacks but if

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.970 
need to put at least two blacks but if
my<00:03:18.220> black<00:03:18.549> was<00:03:18.760> on<00:03:18.880> the<00:03:19.000> bottom<00:03:19.390> and<00:03:19.769> blues<00:03:20.769> on

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
my black was on the bottom and blues on

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.460 
my black was on the bottom and blues on
the<00:03:21.069> top<00:03:21.280> then<00:03:22.060> I<00:03:22.090> could<00:03:22.540> place<00:03:22.810> a<00:03:23.049> single

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
the top then I could place a single

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.470 
the top then I could place a single
black<00:03:23.620> on<00:03:23.799> the<00:03:23.859> top<00:03:23.890> because<00:03:24.280> now<00:03:24.579> I'm<00:03:24.850> I'm

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
black on the top because now I'm I'm

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.409 
black on the top because now I'm I'm
still<00:03:25.750> tied<00:03:26.850> to<00:03:27.850> two

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:28.419 
still tied to two

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:29.939 
still tied to two
and<00:03:28.510> so<00:03:28.959> what<00:03:29.109> players<00:03:29.290> are<00:03:29.440> gonna<00:03:29.620> be<00:03:29.739> doing

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:29.949 
and so what players are gonna be doing

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:30.990 
and so what players are gonna be doing
is<00:03:30.040> they're<00:03:30.160> going<00:03:30.250> to<00:03:30.310> be<00:03:30.400> placing<00:03:30.880> your

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
is they're going to be placing your

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.620 
is they're going to be placing your
buildings<00:03:31.329> out

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
buildings out

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.860 
buildings out
over<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.020> board<00:03:32.260> and<00:03:32.670> then<00:03:33.670> after<00:03:34.420> all<00:03:34.570> six

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
over the board and then after all six

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.140 
over the board and then after all six
buildings<00:03:35.200> from<00:03:35.920> each<00:03:36.070> of<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.280> players<00:03:36.520> are

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
buildings from each of the players are

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.110 
buildings from each of the players are
placed<00:03:37.510> on<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:37.810> board<00:03:38.460> then<00:03:39.460> a<00:03:39.520> couple<00:03:39.940> things

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
placed on the board then a couple things

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.940 
placed on the board then a couple things
are<00:03:40.420> going<00:03:40.630> to<00:03:40.690> be<00:03:40.780> checked<00:03:43.140> first<00:03:44.140> we<00:03:44.350> see<00:03:44.590> who

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
are going to be checked first we see who

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.800 
are going to be checked first we see who
has<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.190> single<00:03:45.640> tallest<00:03:46.270> building<00:03:46.630> on<00:03:46.750> the

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
has the single tallest building on the

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.440 
has the single tallest building on the
board<00:03:47.430> physically<00:03:48.430> the<00:03:48.580> tallest<00:03:49.000> building<00:03:49.360> on

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
board physically the tallest building on

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.290 
board physically the tallest building on
the<00:03:49.540> board<00:03:49.810> will<00:03:50.410> get<00:03:50.680> three<00:03:51.070> points<00:03:51.310> if<00:03:51.970> there

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
the board will get three points if there

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.330 
the board will get three points if there
is<00:03:52.510> not<00:03:53.200> a<00:03:53.230> single<00:03:53.680> tallest<00:03:53.950> building<00:03:54.160> then<00:03:54.250> no

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
is not a single tallest building then no

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.520 
is not a single tallest building then no
one<00:03:54.520> gets<00:03:54.550> it<00:03:54.880> then<00:03:55.720> we<00:03:55.840> look<00:03:55.990> at<00:03:56.110> the<00:03:56.170> majority

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
one gets it then we look at the majority

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.070 
one gets it then we look at the majority
in<00:03:56.860> each<00:03:56.980> city<00:03:57.310> so<00:03:57.820> over<00:03:58.570> here<00:03:58.720> for<00:03:58.870> example

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
in each city so over here for example

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.420 
in each city so over here for example
blue<00:03:59.440> is<00:03:59.590> the<00:03:59.680> majority<00:03:59.920> because<00:04:00.130> they<00:04:00.310> have

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
blue is the majority because they have

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.800 
blue is the majority because they have
two<00:04:00.640> so<00:04:00.910> they<00:04:01.030> would<00:04:01.150> get<00:04:01.270> two<00:04:01.450> points<00:04:01.780> for

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
two so they would get two points for

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.500 
two so they would get two points for
that<00:04:01.990> city<00:04:02.350> no<00:04:03.010> one<00:04:03.220> has<00:04:03.400> majority<00:04:03.790> here<00:04:03.970> black

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
that city no one has majority here black

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.450 
that city no one has majority here black
though<00:04:04.780> so<00:04:04.990> they<00:04:05.110> get<00:04:05.230> two<00:04:05.440> there's<00:04:05.980> no<00:04:06.190> one<00:04:06.340> in

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:06.460 
though so they get two there's no one in

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.880 
though so they get two there's no one in
this<00:04:06.580> city<00:04:06.640> up<00:04:07.000> there<00:04:07.240> over<00:04:07.690> here<00:04:08.350> black<00:04:08.650> gets

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
this city up there over here black gets

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.560 
this city up there over here black gets
another<00:04:09.130> two<00:04:09.340> points<00:04:09.700> and<00:04:09.850> over<00:04:10.030> here<00:04:10.240> it's<00:04:10.510> a

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
another two points and over here it's a

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.810 
another two points and over here it's a
tie<00:04:10.750> so<00:04:10.990> no<00:04:11.110> one<00:04:11.230> gets<00:04:11.410> it<00:04:11.590> and<00:04:11.860> then<00:04:12.580> each

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
tie so no one gets it and then each

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.640 
tie so no one gets it and then each
person<00:04:13.030> gets<00:04:13.360> one<00:04:13.450> point<00:04:13.810> for<00:04:14.080> every<00:04:14.110> tower

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
person gets one point for every tower

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.250 
person gets one point for every tower
that<00:04:15.340> you<00:04:15.640> see<00:04:15.880> on<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.209> board<00:04:16.390> for<00:04:16.690> them<00:04:16.810> so

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
that you see on the board for them so

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.199 
that you see on the board for them so
blue<00:04:17.560> would<00:04:17.709> get<00:04:17.860> one<00:04:18.010> two<00:04:18.190> three<00:04:18.489> orange

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
blue would get one two three orange

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.390 
blue would get one two three orange
would<00:04:19.330> get<00:04:19.480> two<00:04:19.690> and<00:04:19.959> black<00:04:20.500> would<00:04:20.709> get<00:04:20.890> four

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
would get two and black would get four

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.900 
would get two and black would get four
that's<00:04:22.360> how<00:04:22.510> you<00:04:22.570> score<00:04:22.960> each<00:04:23.530> round<00:04:23.920> then<00:04:24.760> you

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
that's how you score each round then you

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.850 
that's how you score each round then you
draw<00:04:25.120> six<00:04:25.420> more<00:04:25.600> pieces<00:04:25.840> pick<00:04:26.290> out<00:04:26.410> six<00:04:26.650> more

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
draw six more pieces pick out six more

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.560 
draw six more pieces pick out six more
and<00:04:26.890> you<00:04:27.040> keep<00:04:27.190> going<00:04:27.460> until<00:04:27.520> you've<00:04:27.790> used<00:04:27.820> all

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
and you keep going until you've used all

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.990 
and you keep going until you've used all
your<00:04:29.110> tower<00:04:29.710> pieces<00:04:30.160> after<00:04:30.430> four<00:04:30.640> rounds

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
your tower pieces after four rounds

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.760 
your tower pieces after four rounds
whoever<00:04:31.510> has<00:04:31.660> the<00:04:31.810> most<00:04:31.930> points<00:04:32.230> is<00:04:32.530> the

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
whoever has the most points is the

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.460 
whoever has the most points is the
winner<00:04:33.240> now<00:04:34.240> when<00:04:34.390> I<00:04:34.480> play<00:04:34.660> Manhattan<00:04:35.200> I<00:04:35.260> play

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
winner now when I play Manhattan I play

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.470 
winner now when I play Manhattan I play
with<00:04:35.620> a<00:04:35.650> little<00:04:35.890> variant<00:04:36.340> sometimes<00:04:36.820> the

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
with a little variant sometimes the

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.780 
with a little variant sometimes the
monster<00:04:37.780> variant<00:04:38.470> and<00:04:38.590> so<00:04:38.830> I<00:04:38.860> go<00:04:39.250> find<00:04:39.460> some

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
monster variant and so I go find some

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.660 
monster variant and so I go find some
little<00:04:40.570> cheesy<00:04:40.870> monsters<00:04:41.500> somewhere<00:04:42.010> so

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
little cheesy monsters somewhere so

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.550 
little cheesy monsters somewhere so
we'll<00:04:43.300> start<00:04:43.630> with<00:04:43.750> one<00:04:43.870> of<00:04:43.900> these<00:04:44.050> monsters

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
we'll start with one of these monsters

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.280 
we'll start with one of these monsters
on<00:04:44.800> the<00:04:44.830> board<00:04:45.220> and<00:04:45.780> the<00:04:46.780> way<00:04:46.900> the<00:04:47.110> monster

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
on the board and the way the monster

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.990 
on the board and the way the monster
variant<00:04:47.860> is<00:04:47.980> played<00:04:48.310> is<00:04:48.520> when<00:04:48.670> you<00:04:48.760> played<00:04:48.970> a

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
variant is played is when you played a

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.220 
variant is played is when you played a
card<00:04:49.240> not<00:04:49.390> only<00:04:49.450> do<00:04:49.630> you<00:04:49.690> put<00:04:49.870> out<00:04:49.960> a<00:04:49.990> building

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
card not only do you put out a building

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.950 
card not only do you put out a building
but<00:04:50.830> you<00:04:50.980> move<00:04:51.160> the<00:04:51.400> monster<00:04:51.910> now<00:04:52.510> this<00:04:52.720> board

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
but you move the monster now this board

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.870 
but you move the monster now this board
is<00:04:53.080> not<00:04:53.200> the<00:04:53.380> best<00:04:53.620> board<00:04:54.100> for<00:04:54.370> the<00:04:54.490> monster

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
is not the best board for the monster

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.380 
is not the best board for the monster
because<00:04:55.690> these<00:04:55.900> cities<00:04:56.380> are<00:04:56.710> not<00:04:57.220> even<00:04:58.180> but

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
because these cities are not even but

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.360 
because these cities are not even but
you<00:04:58.510> just<00:04:58.630> have<00:04:58.750> to<00:04:58.840> remember<00:04:59.020> that<00:04:59.170> this<00:04:59.500> spot

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
you just have to remember that this spot

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.890 
you just have to remember that this spot
corresponds<00:05:01.180> to<00:05:01.210> this<00:05:01.360> one<00:05:01.420> this<00:05:01.690> spot

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
corresponds to this one this spot

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.180 
corresponds to this one this spot
corresponds<00:05:02.440> to<00:05:02.470> this<00:05:02.590> one<00:05:02.740> so<00:05:02.830> if<00:05:02.890> I<00:05:02.950> play

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
corresponds to this one so if I play

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.600 
corresponds to this one so if I play
this

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
this

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.700 
this
that<00:05:04.180> means<00:05:04.360> the<00:05:04.510> monster<00:05:04.870> moves<00:05:05.080> one<00:05:05.380> to<00:05:05.590> the

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
that means the monster moves one to the

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.150 
that means the monster moves one to the
right<00:05:05.920> so<00:05:06.820> the<00:05:06.910> monster<00:05:07.180> will<00:05:07.270> move<00:05:07.420> here<00:05:07.630> and

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
right so the monster will move here and

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.140 
right so the monster will move here and
then<00:05:09.160> if<00:05:09.250> someone<00:05:09.400> played<00:05:09.640> this<00:05:09.820> that<00:05:10.030> would

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
then if someone played this that would

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.420 
then if someone played this that would
mean<00:05:10.270> the<00:05:10.390> monster<00:05:10.540> moves<00:05:10.870> one<00:05:11.110> down<00:05:11.440> and<00:05:11.740> we

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
mean the monster moves one down and we

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.010 
mean the monster moves one down and we
play<00:05:12.640> with<00:05:12.790> a<00:05:12.850> wraparound<00:05:13.180> board<00:05:13.540> so<00:05:13.690> he<00:05:13.750> moved

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
play with a wraparound board so he moved

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.470 
play with a wraparound board so he moved
down<00:05:14.260> from<00:05:14.290> here<00:05:14.710> he'd<00:05:15.340> move<00:05:15.610> up<00:05:15.820> to<00:05:16.030> that<00:05:16.150> spot

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
down from here he'd move up to that spot

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.690 
down from here he'd move up to that spot
there<00:05:16.810> and<00:05:17.080> then<00:05:17.530> this<00:05:17.680> one<00:05:17.890> the<00:05:18.280> monster

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
there and then this one the monster

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.800 
there and then this one the monster
moves<00:05:18.940> diagonally<00:05:19.660> over<00:05:20.440> and<00:05:21.310> if<00:05:22.240> the<00:05:22.450> monster

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
moves diagonally over and if the monster

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.090 
moves diagonally over and if the monster
moves<00:05:22.990> into<00:05:23.200> a<00:05:23.230> spot<00:05:23.500> where<00:05:23.680> the<00:05:23.770> buildings

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
moves into a spot where the buildings

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.490 
moves into a spot where the buildings
are<00:05:24.250> he<00:05:24.880> destroys<00:05:25.540> all<00:05:25.960> those<00:05:26.200> buildings

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
are he destroys all those buildings

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.890 
are he destroys all those buildings
makes<00:05:26.950> a<00:05:27.040> much<00:05:27.190> more<00:05:27.370> destructive<00:05:27.820> game<00:05:28.330> you

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
makes a much more destructive game you

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.360 
makes a much more destructive game you
can<00:05:29.020> play<00:05:29.080> with<00:05:29.230> a<00:05:29.290> little<00:05:29.560> monster<00:05:30.160> where<00:05:30.280> he

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
can play with a little monster where he

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.030 
can play with a little monster where he
only<00:05:30.580> destroys<00:05:30.910> the<00:05:31.030> top<00:05:31.270> section<00:05:31.840> which<00:05:32.830> also

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040 
only destroys the top section which also

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.800 
only destroys the top section which also
works<00:05:33.430> but<00:05:33.970> I<00:05:34.000> think<00:05:34.240> it's<00:05:34.360> more<00:05:34.450> fun<00:05:34.630> to<00:05:34.780> play

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
works but I think it's more fun to play

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.540 
works but I think it's more fun to play
where<00:05:35.050> he<00:05:35.080> absolutely<00:05:35.560> destroys<00:05:35.920> the<00:05:36.160> largest

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
where he absolutely destroys the largest

the pieces you're putting out the towers
and<00:05:46.499> the<00:05:46.559> board<00:05:46.830> and<00:05:47.009> people<00:05:47.249> say<00:05:47.369> oh<00:05:47.399> you<00:05:47.550> know

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 
that makes sense and and pretty soon

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:52.309 
that makes sense and and pretty soon
they<00:05:50.849> they<00:05:51.059> at<00:05:51.300> first<00:05:51.360> when<00:05:51.869> everyone<00:05:52.199> plays

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:52.319 
they they at first when everyone plays

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:54.589 
they they at first when everyone plays

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:54.599 
it almost always everyone tries to build

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:56.149 
it almost always everyone tries to build
that<00:05:54.749> tallest<00:05:55.110> tower<00:05:55.259> because<00:05:55.649> it's<00:05:55.830> neat<00:05:55.979> you

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:56.159 
that tallest tower because it's neat you

00:05:56.159 --> 00:06:00.049 
that tallest tower because it's neat you
can<00:05:56.219> get<00:05:56.369> to<00:05:56.819> be<00:05:56.939> this<00:05:57.089> high<00:05:57.619> and<00:05:58.849> that<00:05:59.849> gives

00:06:00.049 --> 00:06:00.059 
can get to be this high and that gives

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:02.029 
can get to be this high and that gives
you<00:06:00.149> three<00:06:00.300> points<00:06:00.509> per<00:06:00.779> turn<00:06:00.959> but<00:06:01.259> control

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 
you three points per turn but control

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:03.469 
you three points per turn but control
your<00:06:02.189> majorities<00:06:02.610> in<00:06:02.639> the<00:06:02.849> cities<00:06:03.149> is<00:06:03.330> much

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 
your majorities in the cities is much

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:04.820 
your majorities in the cities is much
more<00:06:03.689> important<00:06:04.080> because<00:06:04.110> you<00:06:04.469> may<00:06:04.589> have<00:06:04.740> the

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
more important because you may have the

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.109 
more important because you may have the
tallest<00:06:05.159> one<00:06:05.189> but<00:06:05.429> if<00:06:05.520> I<00:06:05.580> control<00:06:05.849> three

00:06:06.109 --> 00:06:06.119 
tallest one but if I control three

00:06:06.119 --> 00:06:07.939 
tallest one but if I control three
cities<00:06:06.449> I<00:06:06.599> just<00:06:07.080> gotten<00:06:07.319> six<00:06:07.499> points<00:06:07.830> and

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:07.949 
cities I just gotten six points and

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:10.309 
cities I just gotten six points and
double<00:06:08.279> what<00:06:08.399> you've<00:06:08.550> gotten<00:06:08.939> and<00:06:09.119> so<00:06:09.779> you'll

00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:10.319 
double what you've gotten and so you'll

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:13.249 
double what you've gotten and so you'll
see<00:06:10.559> that<00:06:10.770> happening<00:06:11.429> a<00:06:11.610> lot<00:06:11.819> but<00:06:12.539> as<00:06:12.719> the<00:06:13.110> game

00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:13.259 
see that happening a lot but as the game

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:14.809 
see that happening a lot but as the game
progresses<00:06:13.679> it's<00:06:13.949> it's<00:06:14.129> fun<00:06:14.369> because<00:06:14.669> you<00:06:14.789> can

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:14.819 
progresses it's it's fun because you can

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:17.149 
progresses it's it's fun because you can
play<00:06:15.149> it<00:06:15.300> and<00:06:15.449> you<00:06:15.929> could<00:06:16.050> be<00:06:16.139> cutthroat<00:06:16.649> take

00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:17.159 
play it and you could be cutthroat take

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:18.589 
play it and you could be cutthroat take
out<00:06:17.279> the<00:06:17.339> people's<00:06:17.580> buildings<00:06:17.939> but<00:06:18.479> at<00:06:18.539> the

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:18.599 
out the people's buildings but at the

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:19.790 
out the people's buildings but at the
same<00:06:18.749> time<00:06:18.959> you<00:06:19.139> can't<00:06:19.319> be<00:06:19.409> too<00:06:19.589> cutthroat

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 
same time you can't be too cutthroat

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.679 
same time you can't be too cutthroat
because<00:06:20.279> the<00:06:20.789> more<00:06:20.969> you<00:06:21.059> go<00:06:21.149> after<00:06:21.269> someone

00:06:21.679 --> 00:06:21.689 
because the more you go after someone

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:23.839 
because the more you go after someone
else<00:06:21.839> you're<00:06:22.589> not<00:06:22.619> helping<00:06:23.069> yourself<00:06:23.159> out<00:06:23.669> as

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:23.849 
else you're not helping yourself out as

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:25.279 
else you're not helping yourself out as
much<00:06:24.059> and<00:06:24.269> so<00:06:24.389> that's<00:06:24.569> interesting<00:06:24.990> that<00:06:25.019> back

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:25.289 
much and so that's interesting that back

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:27.739 
much and so that's interesting that back
and<00:06:25.469> forth<00:06:25.559> and<00:06:25.919> it<00:06:26.580> works<00:06:26.879> best<00:06:27.240> as<00:06:27.449> a<00:06:27.479> four

00:06:27.739 --> 00:06:27.749 
and forth and it works best as a four

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:29.779 
and forth and it works best as a four
player<00:06:28.019> game<00:06:28.080> yeah<00:06:28.709> it<00:06:29.249> does<00:06:29.369> it's<00:06:29.519> not<00:06:29.580> too

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:29.789

00:06:31.549 --> 00:06:31.559 
bad three player but that four player

00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:33.029 
game it just works really well with

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:34.999 
game it just works really well with
buildings<00:06:33.419> over<00:06:33.629> the<00:06:33.689> board<00:06:33.929> has<00:06:34.349> a<00:06:34.379> wonderful

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:35.009

buildings over the board has a wonderful
visual<00:06:35.249> effect<00:06:35.699> as<00:06:35.849> you<00:06:35.969> see<00:06:36.089> these<00:06:36.269> buildings

00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:36.659 
visual effect as you see these buildings

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:38.959 
visual effect as you see these buildings
getting<00:06:36.899> taller<00:06:37.139> and<00:06:37.259> taller<00:06:37.469> the<00:06:38.459> Godzilla

variant<00:06:39.360> now<00:06:39.539> I<00:06:39.569> try<00:06:39.899> to<00:06:39.959> put<00:06:40.169> out<00:06:40.259> as<00:06:40.349> much<00:06:40.469> as

00:06:40.609 --> 00:06:40.619 
variant now I try to put out as much as

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:42.320 
variant now I try to put out as much as
possible<00:06:40.679> I<00:06:41.219> don't<00:06:41.279> play<00:06:41.819> it<00:06:41.969> when<00:06:42.089> someone's

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330 
possible I don't play it when someone's

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.540 
possible I don't play it when someone's
never<00:06:42.509> played<00:06:42.749> the<00:06:42.869> game<00:06:42.990> before<00:06:43.050> I<00:06:43.559> wish<00:06:44.399> that

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
never played the game before I wish that

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.089 
never played the game before I wish that
my<00:06:44.729> board<00:06:45.059> was<00:06:45.719> a<00:06:45.779> bit<00:06:46.169> more<00:06:46.379> square<00:06:46.709> layout

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:47.099 
my board was a bit more square layout

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:48.109 
my board was a bit more square layout
because<00:06:47.219> sometimes<00:06:47.550> are<00:06:47.639> like<00:06:47.729> okay<00:06:47.939> if<00:06:48.029> you

00:06:48.109 --> 00:06:48.119 
because sometimes are like okay if you

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:50.529 
because sometimes are like okay if you
go<00:06:48.240> diagonally<00:06:48.869> that<00:06:49.019> way<00:06:49.229> this<00:06:50.039> was<00:06:50.219> here

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:50.539 
go diagonally that way this was here

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:54.259 
go diagonally that way this was here
it's<00:06:51.539> not<00:06:51.779> as<00:06:52.339> intuitive<00:06:53.339> as<00:06:53.669> I'd<00:06:53.819> like<00:06:54.029> it<00:06:54.059> to

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:54.269 
it's not as intuitive as I'd like it to

00:06:54.269 --> 00:06:56.869 
it's not as intuitive as I'd like it to
be<00:06:54.300> but<00:06:54.749> it<00:06:54.869> is<00:06:55.079> fun<00:06:55.559> the<00:06:56.219> tallest<00:06:56.579> tower<00:06:56.729> is

00:06:56.869 --> 00:06:56.879 
be but it is fun the tallest tower is

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:59.089 
be but it is fun the tallest tower is
gonna<00:06:57.029> be<00:06:57.180> here<00:06:57.629> true<00:06:57.779> this<00:06:58.019> big<00:06:58.259> because<00:06:58.949> if

00:06:59.089 --> 00:06:59.099 
gonna be here true this big because if

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:00.799 
gonna be here true this big because if
there<00:06:59.249> is<00:06:59.309> a<00:06:59.339> huge<00:06:59.639> Tower<00:06:59.939> somehow<00:07:00.749> the

00:07:00.799 --> 00:07:00.809 
there is a huge Tower somehow the

00:07:00.809 --> 00:07:03.079 
there is a huge Tower somehow the
monster<00:07:01.379> just<00:07:01.409> seems<00:07:02.069> to<00:07:02.399> keep<00:07:02.579> going<00:07:02.819> that

00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:03.089 
monster just seems to keep going that

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:05.959 
monster just seems to keep going that
direction<00:07:03.240> towards<00:07:03.869> that<00:07:04.019> tower<00:07:04.669> but<00:07:05.669> I<00:07:05.699> still

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:05.969 
direction towards that tower but I still

00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:07.249 
direction towards that tower but I still

like it that way so I could play either
way<00:07:07.499> with<00:07:07.829> or<00:07:07.949> without<00:07:08.069> the<00:07:08.339> monster<00:07:08.669> but<00:07:08.819> it

00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:08.909 
way with or without the monster but it

00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:10.790 
way with or without the monster but it
does<00:07:09.029> add<00:07:09.269> some<00:07:09.509> variety<00:07:09.629> to<00:07:09.869> the<00:07:10.079> game<00:07:10.319> and<00:07:10.589> if
