00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.930
 video of the sounds of the music vi 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.510

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:41.550
 Stefano Masi has already asked which one he has 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.010
 asked for advice for a microphone that 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.110
 could use that is good from 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.440

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:52.190

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:59.810
 there are so many microphones so many types of 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.970

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.430

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:24.530
 they use in recording studios too 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:26.750
 audio post music and some of these 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:31.430
 they don't need a sound card 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:34.420
 of a mix but just connect them with a 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:38.420
 computer usb cable and that's it 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:41.210

 microphones that can work for you 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:53.710
 the ethical blue perhaps one of the most used 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:57.760
 that now you find it on amazon less on 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:02.170
 100 110 because the new one was released 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.890
 new yet the he is small normal 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.550
 let's say basic is a great microphone 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.480
 excellent quality and is quietly 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.000
 usable without a sound card 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.850
 mixer to simply connect it 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.800
 with a USB cable to your computer or yours 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.220

 call him and pro for what you owe 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.650
 I think he is already doing very well 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.840
 it's normal 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:38.920
 how many ambulances are passing by is 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:42.580
 the day of the dead the second blue that 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.340
 they use the tuber which is very good and the 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.860
 blues known ice 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:52.500
 you find it a little less 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.930
 of the blue get it I say it immediately looked 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.640
 do all an instant search on 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.030
 amazon 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:04.230
 then the blues noble what exactly 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:06.450
 64 euros up on amazon and is sure that with 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:11.490
 those 64 euros will go is a very good one 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:14.190
 quality and you'll be fine for more or less 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:17.730
 as the mechanism always like him pleased 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.769
 in the sense that the usb plate and eva the only one 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.280
 which seems to me to the extra tickets 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:28.530
 that an extra quality but 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:29.790
 certain that already the blues noble is good and 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:34.800
 very good 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:38.340
 then if you go to search on the internet on 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.850
 amazon there are plenty of microphones a 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.310
 capacitor that do not require 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:48.169
 sound card mixer that you can 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:50.850
 quietly going to stick to the 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.490
 computer to record and are fine 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.710
 also for the guitar then maybe karnow 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.620
 for the item you buy a pop up filter 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.680
 which costs 9 euros 10 eur 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:06.600
 always on the internet which is a filter 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:09.930
 precisely which serves to minimize i 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.930
 breathe and these annoying noises in 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:15.180
 more and let's just say let's say 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:19.560
 only the voice or just the sound is needed 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:22.080
 of guitar and leaves the rest though if 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.270
 you want advice when you need to register 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.190
 the audio put us too far too fast while if 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.720
 when when you have to register with the 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:32.880
 guitar and guitar sound you 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:35.160
 should remove it because maybe it tends to 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.460
 keep to keep too much of the sound e 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:41.050
 instead I prefer resistance well 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.180
 fuck the guitar sound 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.430
