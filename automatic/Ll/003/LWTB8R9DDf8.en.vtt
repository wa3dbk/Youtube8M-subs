bigboss repo now let's go ahead and take
a<00:00:14.040> look<00:00:14.250> at<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.460> description<00:00:14.790> of<00:00:15.120> what<00:00:15.360> this

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
a look at the description of what this

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.900 
a look at the description of what this
is<00:00:15.780> it<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.170> modified<00:00:16.859> lockscreen<00:00:17.550> clock

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
is it is a modified lockscreen clock

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.810 
is it is a modified lockscreen clock
that<00:00:18.420> allows<00:00:18.720> you<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:18.990> read<00:00:19.380> time<00:00:19.770> in<00:00:20.130> binary

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
that allows you to read time in binary

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.480 
that allows you to read time in binary
code<00:00:21.150> or<00:00:21.390> binary<00:00:21.689> time<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:22.619> will<00:00:22.800> impress

code or binary time and you will impress

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.300 
code or binary time and you will impress
others<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.720> if<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:24.990> guys<00:00:25.140> learn<00:00:25.500> how<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.890> read

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
others so if you guys learn how to read

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.220 
others so if you guys learn how to read
binary<00:00:26.609> time<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.300> I'll<00:00:27.359> leave<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.599> link<00:00:27.750> in<00:00:28.140> the

screen<00:00:39.270> how<00:00:39.780> do<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:39.960> know<00:00:40.050> what<00:00:40.230> time<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.559> is

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
screen how do you know what time it is

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.410 
screen how do you know what time it is
so<00:00:41.309> let's<00:00:41.520> go<00:00:41.640> ahead<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.850> look<00:00:42.120> at<00:00:42.300> the

so let's go ahead and look at the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.840 
so let's go ahead and look at the
settings<00:00:42.809> for<00:00:42.899> binary<00:00:43.620> clock<00:00:44.160> we'll<00:00:44.520> go<00:00:44.730> ahead

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
settings for binary clock we'll go ahead

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.450 
settings for binary clock we'll go ahead
and<00:00:45.030> go<00:00:45.600> right<00:00:45.780> here<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.469> can<00:00:46.649> enable<00:00:47.250> or

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
and go right here you can enable or

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.430 
and go right here you can enable or
disable<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.239> can<00:00:48.390> also<00:00:48.510> choose<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:48.989> show

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
disable it you can also choose to show

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.950 
disable it you can also choose to show
the<00:00:49.680> date<00:00:49.950> string<00:00:50.280> on<00:00:50.579> or<00:00:50.940> off<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.719> if<00:00:51.840> we

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
the date string on or off so if we

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.170 
the date string on or off so if we
choose<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.320> have<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.949> off<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.550> go<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.760> our<00:00:53.850> lock

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
choose to have it off and go to our lock

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.660 
choose to have it off and go to our lock
screen<00:00:54.510> will<00:00:54.960> see<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.350> has<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.620> big<00:00:56.160> version

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
screen will see that has a big version

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.700 
screen will see that has a big version
of<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.000> binary<00:00:57.210> clock<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.020> if<00:00:58.079> we<00:00:58.230> turn<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.590> on

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
of the binary clock and if we turn it on

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.099 
of the binary clock and if we turn it on
our<00:00:59.010> date<00:00:59.820> will<00:01:00.030> still<00:01:00.329> show<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.870> clock

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
our date will still show in the clock

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.959 
our date will still show in the clock
will<00:01:01.350> be<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> little<00:01:01.800> bit<00:01:02.039> smaller<00:01:02.399> so

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
will be a little bit smaller so

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.700 
will be a little bit smaller so
obviously<00:01:03.420> right<00:01:03.719> there<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.140> have<00:01:04.350> your<00:01:04.379> our

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
obviously right there you have your our

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.010 
obviously right there you have your our
hand<00:01:05.159> your<00:01:05.400> minute<00:01:05.760> hand<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.299> your<00:01:06.510> second

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
hand your minute hand and your second

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.600 
hand your minute hand and your second
hand<00:01:07.229> right<00:01:07.470> there<00:01:07.500> at<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.860> end<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.460> can

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
hand right there at the end so you can

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.480 
hand right there at the end so you can
read<00:01:08.820> your<00:01:08.970> time<00:01:09.299> perfectly<00:01:09.990> fine<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.590> we<00:01:11.310> can

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
read your time perfectly fine and we can

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.730 
read your time perfectly fine and we can
also<00:01:11.729> change<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.330> theme<00:01:12.780> on<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:13.200> tweak<00:01:13.500> so

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
also change the theme on this tweak so

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.560 
also change the theme on this tweak so
if<00:01:13.830> we<00:01:13.979> change<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.610> something<00:01:14.850> like<00:01:15.150> cough

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
if we change it to something like cough

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.859 
if we change it to something like cough
syrup<00:01:15.600> cherry<00:01:16.590> dots<00:01:16.979> right<00:01:17.280> there<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:18.180> dots

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
syrup cherry dots right there the dots

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.800 
syrup cherry dots right there the dots
will<00:01:19.170> be<00:01:19.320> cough<00:01:19.680> syrup<00:01:20.100> cherry<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.659> can

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
will be cough syrup cherry and you can

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.539 
will be cough syrup cherry and you can
also<00:01:21.930> choose<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.530> have<00:01:22.710> things<00:01:22.979> like<00:01:23.130> love

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
also choose to have things like love

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.490 
also choose to have things like love
hearts<00:01:24.000> which<00:01:24.420> looks<00:01:24.780> like<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.470> just

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
hearts which looks like that you just

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.830 
hearts which looks like that you just
have<00:01:25.860> hearts<00:01:26.250> in<00:01:26.460> binary<00:01:26.970> code<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.479> your<00:01:27.509> lock

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
have hearts in binary code on your lock

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.310 
have hearts in binary code on your lock
screen<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.439> we<00:01:28.920> can<00:01:29.100> even<00:01:29.400> do<00:01:29.579> something<00:01:29.939> like

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
screen and we can even do something like

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
there is the current time in binary code

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.560 
there is the current time in binary code
which<00:01:48.329> is<00:01:48.860> 445<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.670> guys<00:01:50.880> I'll<00:01:51.149> leave<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.450> link
