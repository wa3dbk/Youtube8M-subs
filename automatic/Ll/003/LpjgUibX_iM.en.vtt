the floating movement of astronauts was

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.899 
the floating movement of astronauts was
achieved<00:01:10.869> in<00:01:11.110> a<00:01:11.500> number<00:01:11.799> of<00:01:11.830> ways<00:01:11.950> and<00:01:12.700> you

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
achieved in a number of ways and you

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.310 
achieved in a number of ways and you
know<00:01:13.030> anywhere<00:01:13.330> from<00:01:13.390> what<00:01:13.750> you<00:01:13.840> see<00:01:14.020> here

which is an actor on a dolly moving
through<00:01:18.159> the<00:01:18.250> shot<00:01:18.460> to<00:01:19.240> floating<00:01:20.049> on<00:01:20.170> what<00:01:20.350> was

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
through the shot to floating on what was

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.870 
through the shot to floating on what was
called<00:01:20.619> a<00:01:20.740> parallelogram<00:01:21.280> which<00:01:21.700> is

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
called a parallelogram which is

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.840 
called a parallelogram which is
basically<00:01:22.330> a<00:01:22.479> balanced<00:01:22.990> bar<00:01:23.290> that<00:01:24.190> this<00:01:24.399> actor

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
basically a balanced bar that this actor

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.960 
basically a balanced bar that this actor
is<00:01:24.880> on<00:01:25.180> which<00:01:25.840> lets<00:01:26.649> us<00:01:26.830> rise<00:01:27.130> the<00:01:27.369> actor<00:01:27.700> very

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
is on which lets us rise the actor very

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.690 
is on which lets us rise the actor very
fluidly<00:01:28.540> and<00:01:28.899> drop<00:01:29.110> the<00:01:29.290> actor<00:01:29.680> and<00:01:29.979> in<00:01:30.490> some

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
fluidly and drop the actor and in some

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.370 
fluidly and drop the actor and in some
scenes<00:01:30.909> we<00:01:31.090> also<00:01:31.240> did<00:01:31.509> some<00:01:31.659> wire<00:01:31.899> work<00:01:32.140> as

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
scenes we also did some wire work as

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.740 
scenes we also did some wire work as
well<00:01:32.590> to<00:01:32.890> achieve<00:01:33.490> a<00:01:33.520> weightless<00:01:33.940> effect<00:01:34.360> here

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
well to achieve a weightless effect here

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.420 
well to achieve a weightless effect here
we<00:01:34.869> have<00:01:35.020> you<00:01:35.259> know<00:01:35.350> a<00:01:35.380> still<00:01:35.710> frame<00:01:35.950> of<00:01:36.190> one<00:01:36.310> of

we have you know a still frame of one of

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.010 
we have you know a still frame of one of
the<00:01:36.490> green<00:01:36.670> screen<00:01:36.700> shots<00:01:37.240> of<00:01:37.420> astronauts

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
that we shot floating on the stage so

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.880 
that we shot floating on the stage so
you<00:01:40.479> know<00:01:40.600> once<00:01:40.780> we<00:01:40.840> have<00:01:41.020> a<00:01:41.050> very<00:01:41.380> nice<00:01:41.590> fluid

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
you know once we have a very nice fluid

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.820 
you know once we have a very nice fluid
shot<00:01:42.570> we<00:01:43.570> then<00:01:43.780> you<00:01:43.990> know<00:01:44.110> can<00:01:44.440> jump<00:01:44.649> to<00:01:44.740> the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
shot we then you know can jump to the

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.950 
shot we then you know can jump to the
final<00:01:45.220> and<00:01:45.369> see<00:01:45.670> you<00:01:46.509> know<00:01:46.600> just<00:01:46.810> how<00:01:46.899> we

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
final and see you know just how we

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.320 
final and see you know just how we
integrated<00:01:47.500> them<00:01:47.740> along<00:01:48.039> the<00:01:48.220> surface<00:01:49.860> okay

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
integrated them along the surface okay

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.469 
integrated them along the surface okay
