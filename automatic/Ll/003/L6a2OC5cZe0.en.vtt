you're<00:00:08.970> there<00:00:09.440> this<00:00:10.440> four-wheeler<00:00:10.860> currently

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
you're there this four-wheeler currently

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.580 
you're there this four-wheeler currently
has<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.490> problem<00:00:11.940> with<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.300> transmission<00:00:12.630> it

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
has a problem with the transmission it

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.079 
has a problem with the transmission it
will<00:00:13.799> shift<00:00:14.040> into<00:00:14.340> reverse<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.880> work

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
will shift into reverse and work

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.090 
will shift into reverse and work
properly<00:00:15.509> but<00:00:16.020> when<00:00:16.109> you<00:00:16.199> put<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.440> in<00:00:16.529> forward

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
properly but when you put it in forward

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.490 
properly but when you put it in forward
it<00:00:17.730> does<00:00:17.880> not<00:00:18.029> go<00:00:18.300> into<00:00:18.449> forward<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.109> it<00:00:19.289> makes

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
it does not go into forward and it makes

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.890 
it does not go into forward and it makes
a<00:00:19.619> grinding<00:00:20.130> noise<00:00:20.310> in<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.580> transmission<00:00:21.150> so

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
a grinding noise in the transmission so

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.939 
a grinding noise in the transmission so
in<00:00:21.990> this<00:00:22.050> video<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.439> engine<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:22.830> being

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
in this video the engine is being

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.109 
in this video the engine is being
removed<00:00:23.480> you<00:00:24.480> can<00:00:24.570> see<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.720> engine<00:00:25.529> up<00:00:25.619> on<00:00:25.740> the

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
removed you can see the engine up on the

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.179 
removed you can see the engine up on the
workbench<00:00:27.119> in<00:00:27.300> just<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.539> second<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.830> cover

is<00:00:29.310> going<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.609> be<00:00:29.670> they<00:00:29.760> can<00:00:29.910> offer<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.240> engine

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
is going to be they can offer the engine

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.540 
is going to be they can offer the engine
so<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.750> can<00:00:30.900> see<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.140> transmission

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.360 

in<00:00:37.480> a<00:00:37.930> second<00:00:38.350> you'll<00:00:38.470> see<00:00:38.560> the<00:00:38.800> engine<00:00:39.100> up<00:00:39.220> on

good<00:00:45.970> shape

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
good shape

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.290 
good shape
we<00:00:47.200> didn't<00:00:47.410> see<00:00:47.470> any<00:00:47.590> damage<00:00:47.800> to<00:00:48.100> the<00:00:48.190> gears<00:00:48.489> a

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
we didn't see any damage to the gears a

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.240 
we didn't see any damage to the gears a
couple<00:00:49.780> parts<00:00:50.080> did<00:00:50.290> seem<00:00:50.500> to<00:00:50.650> have<00:00:50.800> wear<00:00:51.100> and

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
couple parts did seem to have wear and

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.770 
couple parts did seem to have wear and
tear<00:00:51.489> and<00:00:51.700> those<00:00:52.210> are<00:00:52.330> the<00:00:52.390> parts<00:00:52.629> are<00:00:52.690> going

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
tear and those are the parts are going

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.090 
tear and those are the parts are going
to<00:00:52.900> be<00:00:52.960> replaced<00:00:53.320> to<00:00:53.470> hopefully<00:00:53.739> fix<00:00:53.920> the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
to be replaced to hopefully fix the

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.880 
to be replaced to hopefully fix the
problem<00:00:54.540> one<00:00:55.540> part<00:00:55.840> is<00:00:55.989> going<00:00:56.170> to<00:00:56.290> be<00:00:56.590> the

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
problem one part is going to be the

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.979 
problem one part is going to be the
shift<00:00:57.550> ratchet<00:00:58.059> and<00:00:58.239> the<00:00:58.570> other<00:00:58.690> part<00:00:58.930> is

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
shift ratchet and the other part is

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:00.869 
shift ratchet and the other part is
going<00:00:59.080> to<00:00:59.140> be<00:00:59.230> the<00:00:59.320> shift<00:00:59.500> fork<00:00:59.890> and<00:01:00.790> I'll

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
going to be the shift fork and I'll

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:02.220 
going to be the shift fork and I'll
explain<00:01:01.090> it<00:01:01.180> in<00:01:01.210> just<00:01:01.420> a<00:01:01.480> second<00:01:01.840> I'll<00:01:01.989> check

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
explain it in just a second I'll check

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.869 
explain it in just a second I'll check
back<00:01:02.379> later<00:01:02.440> on<00:01:02.710> and<00:01:02.860> see<00:01:03.190> part<00:01:03.550> two<00:01:03.700> of<00:01:03.730> this

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
back later on and see part two of this

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:05.400 
back later on and see part two of this
video<00:01:04.150> to<00:01:04.270> see<00:01:04.390> if<00:01:04.420> those<00:01:04.510> parts<00:01:04.780> actually<00:01:05.110> fix

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
video to see if those parts actually fix

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.940 
video to see if those parts actually fix
the<00:01:05.500> problem<00:01:07.020> basically<00:01:08.020> there's<00:01:08.410> two<00:01:08.470> ears

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
the problem basically there's two ears

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.200 
the problem basically there's two ears
and<00:01:09.280> you'll<00:01:09.430> see<00:01:09.520> them<00:01:09.610> in<00:01:09.640> a<00:01:09.700> second<00:01:10.060> one<00:01:10.180> on

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
and you'll see them in a second one on

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.550 
and you'll see them in a second one on
your<00:01:10.390> left<00:01:10.509> is<00:01:10.690> going<00:01:10.810> to<00:01:10.869> be<00:01:10.960> for<00:01:11.229> reverse

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
your left is going to be for reverse

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.440 
your left is going to be for reverse
it's<00:01:11.800> the<00:01:11.890> bigger<00:01:12.100> gear<00:01:12.400> and<00:01:12.610> the<00:01:13.119> one<00:01:13.270> of<00:01:13.360> the

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
it's the bigger gear and the one of the

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.620 
it's the bigger gear and the one of the
right<00:01:14.020> is<00:01:14.229> for<00:01:14.470> forward<00:01:14.979> is<00:01:15.130> smaller<00:01:15.550> gear<00:01:15.910> in

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
right is for forward is smaller gear in

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.070 
right is for forward is smaller gear in
the<00:01:16.780> middle<00:01:17.140> you're<00:01:17.560> going<00:01:17.680> to<00:01:17.740> see<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:19.509> shift

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
the middle you're going to see the shift

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.859 
the middle you're going to see the shift
ratchet<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:21.580> attach<00:01:21.880> to<00:01:21.910> the<00:01:22.210> shift<00:01:22.509> ratchet

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
ratchet and attach to the shift ratchet

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:24.450 
ratchet and attach to the shift ratchet
which<00:01:23.080> makes<00:01:23.290> the<00:01:23.440> ship<00:01:23.560> ratchet<00:01:23.950> move<00:01:24.100> left

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
which makes the ship ratchet move left

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.480 
which makes the ship ratchet move left
to<00:01:24.550> right<00:01:24.640> is<00:01:25.000> going<00:01:25.330> to<00:01:25.450> be<00:01:25.570> the<00:01:25.750> shift<00:01:25.960> fork

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
to right is going to be the shift fork

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.680 
to right is going to be the shift fork
and<00:01:27.490> those<00:01:27.670> are<00:01:27.820> the<00:01:27.880> two<00:01:28.030> parts<00:01:28.270> that<00:01:28.450> we<00:01:28.540> are

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
and those are the two parts that we are

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.690 
and those are the two parts that we are
replacing<00:01:29.020> you<00:01:29.380> see<00:01:29.530> right<00:01:29.740> there<00:01:29.950> the<00:01:30.399> shift

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
replacing you see right there the shift

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.040 
replacing you see right there the shift
fork<00:01:30.970> is<00:01:31.119> actually<00:01:31.450> on<00:01:31.600> the<00:01:32.009> shift<00:01:33.009> shaft<00:01:34.050> well

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
fork is actually on the shift shaft well

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.139 
fork is actually on the shift shaft well
there<00:01:35.170> I<00:01:35.200> am<00:01:35.380> use<00:01:35.560> moving<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:36.040> shifter<00:01:36.369> right

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
there I am use moving the shifter right

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:38.550 
there I am use moving the shifter right
at<00:01:37.300> the<00:01:37.390> bottom<00:01:37.630> you<00:01:37.720> see<00:01:37.750> the<00:01:37.899> shift<00:01:38.350> shaft

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
at the bottom you see the shift shaft
