thing too is that it actually
once<00:04:21.660> you've<00:04:21.900> popped<00:04:22.610> and<00:04:23.610> ruptured<00:04:24.150> a<00:04:24.449> skin

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
once you've popped and ruptured a skin

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.379 
once you've popped and ruptured a skin
follicle<00:04:25.470> it's<00:04:26.039> less<00:04:26.370> likely<00:04:26.639> that<00:04:26.820> it<00:04:27.210> will

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
follicle it's less likely that it will

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.620 
follicle it's less likely that it will
ever<00:04:27.570> go<00:04:27.810> back<00:04:27.960> to<00:04:28.169> its<00:04:28.320> original<00:04:28.440> shape<00:04:29.630> which

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
ever go back to its original shape which

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.089 
ever go back to its original shape which
means<00:04:30.810> it's<00:04:31.050> more<00:04:31.169> likely<00:04:31.410> to<00:04:31.590> get<00:04:31.770> clogged

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:32.099 
means it's more likely to get clogged

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:34.310 
means it's more likely to get clogged
and<00:04:32.310> have<00:04:32.520> acne<00:04:32.910> in<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.120> future<00:04:33.479> and<00:04:33.660> this<00:04:33.810> can

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
and have acne in the future and this can

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.860 
and have acne in the future and this can
happen<00:04:34.949> you<00:04:35.340> know<00:04:35.460> months<00:04:36.060> years<00:04:36.360> down<00:04:36.690> the

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
happen you know months years down the

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.719 
happen you know months years down the
line<00:04:36.900> okay<00:04:37.560> so<00:04:38.190> the<00:04:38.789> sooner<00:04:39.150> you<00:04:39.180> stop<00:04:40.729> the
