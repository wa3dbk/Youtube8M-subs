00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.590
 details 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.059
 we started with the lettuce we washed well and 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.910
 to drain what we can use a 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:39.770
 gadget of these is a marvel 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.910
 see what way to drain water 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.910
 we give it a few laps 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.500
 we uncover and here we have it 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:55.420
 Look how much water will last 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.460
 cut it we take three leaves the 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.680
 we wrap lightly and we give them some 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.600
 cuts throughout this cut is very 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.460
 practical and comfortable and at lunchtime 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.379
 it is ideal 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.180
 then we cut half onion in 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.590
 finite discs 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.590
 we do the same with the tomato 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.700
 we take half an apple and remove the 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.340
 tips and now let's cut in shape 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.320
 of half moons on equal discs 3 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.870
 millimeters wide 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.760
 and let's go with the chicken I'm using 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.890
 a chicken that cooked curry is very 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.750
 simple be Sunday a little oil 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.479
 as a curry special it is marinated 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.430
 half an hour and the iron is made 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.940
 ideal now we chop invasions 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.190
 finite 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.180
 and we are going to make a vinaigrette 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.040
 we will prepare the basic vinaigrette 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.640
 we will put 3 tablespoons of oil 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.800
 olive and one of lemon juice or vinegar 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.000
 apple is also very good 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.880
 then half teaspoon of 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.350
 fragile fragile and we beat well 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.900
 this would be the point when the 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.030
 whitish 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.220
 and we are going to assemble the plate we do 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.230
 our base with lettuce we distribute the 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.210
 onion then the discs of 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:06.979
 tomato and place the chicken in the center 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.770
 we make eat all around with the 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.450
 apple croissants 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.790
 and now we distribute the vinaigrette 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.160
 over since we are using the 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.110
 100% natural ingredients the oil of 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.660
 olive that is very digestive like 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.310
 apples and combat 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.880
 and a problem with the bed blowing 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.620
 olives and it is ideal 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.140
 this what I call a salad 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.250
 detoxifying since we have the onion 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.530
 and the apple that help us eliminate 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.900
 toxins and olives the tomato and the 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.070
 lettuce has been complemented completely and 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.870
 now I say is a combination that is 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.000
 very rich 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.260
