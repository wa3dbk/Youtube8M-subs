00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
one is a very liquid format we have a

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.010 
one is a very liquid format we have a
screen<00:00:31.140> here<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.740> has<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:31.949> residue<00:00:32.899> hazen<00:00:33.899> it

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
screen here that has a residue hazen it

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.930 
screen here that has a residue hazen it
left<00:00:34.290> in<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.590> from<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.829> ink<00:00:35.160> stains<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.760> so

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
left in it from the ink stains and so

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.700 
left in it from the ink stains and so
forth<00:00:36.239> what<00:00:36.719> we're<00:00:36.870> going<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.050> do<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.440> apply<00:00:37.649> a

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
forth what we're going to do is apply a

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.740 
forth what we're going to do is apply a
little<00:00:37.950> bit<00:00:38.040> onto<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.399> brush<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.450> little<00:00:39.660> bit

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
little bit onto a brush and a little bit

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.110 
little bit onto a brush and a little bit
on<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.290> screen<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.950> take<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.910> out<00:00:42.090> of

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
on to that screen and take that out of

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:54.900 
on to that screen and take that out of
there

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.069 

what<00:00:55.910> you<00:00:56.030> want<00:00:56.180> to<00:00:56.239> do<00:00:56.329> is<00:00:56.480> scrub<00:00:56.719> that<00:00:56.899> in

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
what you want to do is scrub that in

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.200 
what you want to do is scrub that in
well<00:00:57.339> the<00:00:58.339> action<00:00:58.670> of<00:00:58.789> your<00:00:58.910> scrubber

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
well the action of your scrubber

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.720 
well the action of your scrubber
actually<00:00:59.809> takes<00:01:00.110> on<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:01.100> mesh<00:01:01.309> where<00:01:01.640> you

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
actually takes on the mesh where you

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.759 
actually takes on the mesh where you
have<00:01:01.940> your<00:01:01.969> knuckles<00:01:02.480> those<00:01:02.690> crossing<00:01:03.260> fibers

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
have your knuckles those crossing fibers

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.170 
have your knuckles those crossing fibers
and<00:01:03.949> moves<00:01:04.190> them<00:01:04.280> run<00:01:04.489> a<00:01:04.519> little<00:01:04.759> bit<00:01:04.940> so<00:01:05.030> you

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
and moves them run a little bit so you

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.850 
and moves them run a little bit so you
get<00:01:05.330> some<00:01:05.540> of<00:01:05.630> that<00:01:05.780> in<00:01:06.080> there<00:01:06.290> so<00:01:06.619> that<00:01:06.770> it

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
get some of that in there so that it

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.350 
get some of that in there so that it
takes<00:01:07.040> that<00:01:07.250> haze<00:01:07.460> out<00:01:07.700> of<00:01:07.820> there<00:01:07.940> because

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
takes that haze out of there because

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:18.210 
takes that haze out of there because
that's<00:01:08.570> where<00:01:08.720> it<00:01:08.899> can<00:01:08.990> be<00:01:09.020> locked<00:01:09.259> in<00:01:09.500> a<00:01:09.560> lot

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.590 

and<00:01:19.220> again<00:01:19.490> like<00:01:19.670> all<00:01:19.909> of<00:01:20.060> these<00:01:20.210> I<00:01:20.360> like<00:01:20.509> to

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
and again like all of these I like to

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:29.850 
and again like all of these I like to
scrub<00:01:20.869> both<00:01:21.049> sides<00:01:21.350> thoroughly

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.320 

now<00:01:30.860> in<00:01:31.070> a<00:01:31.100> lot<00:01:31.280> of<00:01:31.310> cases<00:01:31.580> when<00:01:31.940> you're<00:01:32.060> doing

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
now in a lot of cases when you're doing

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.510 
now in a lot of cases when you're doing
this<00:01:32.510> you're<00:01:32.720> not<00:01:32.900> doing<00:01:33.320> one<00:01:33.950> screen<00:01:34.310> at<00:01:34.430> a

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
this you're not doing one screen at a

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.040 
this you're not doing one screen at a
time<00:01:34.730> you<00:01:34.970> got<00:01:35.090> a<00:01:35.120> stack<00:01:35.540> of<00:01:35.570> screens

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
time you got a stack of screens

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.140 
time you got a stack of screens
everybody<00:01:37.010> seems<00:01:37.190> to<00:01:37.220> put<00:01:37.400> this<00:01:37.520> off<00:01:37.760> so<00:01:38.030> they

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
everybody seems to put this off so they

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.480 
everybody seems to put this off so they
let<00:01:38.300> them<00:01:38.420> style<00:01:38.900> up<00:01:39.190> once<00:01:40.190> you're<00:01:40.310> going<00:01:40.430> to

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
let them style up once you're going to

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.430 
let them style up once you're going to
do<00:01:40.640> your<00:01:40.820> DAC<00:01:41.210> it's<00:01:41.720> a<00:01:41.780> good<00:01:41.870> idea<00:01:41.990> to<00:01:42.200> do<00:01:42.410> a

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
do your DAC it's a good idea to do a

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.020 
do your DAC it's a good idea to do a
series<00:01:42.710> of<00:01:42.890> them<00:01:43.100> as<00:01:43.220> well<00:01:43.400> once<00:01:43.700> you<00:01:43.820> put<00:01:44.000> it

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
series of them as well once you put it

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.240 
series of them as well once you put it
on<00:01:44.210> let<00:01:45.020> it<00:01:45.050> sit<00:01:45.320> for<00:01:45.350> a<00:01:45.530> few<00:01:45.680> minutes<00:01:45.740> but

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
on let it sit for a few minutes but

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.710 
on let it sit for a few minutes but
while<00:01:46.430> you're<00:01:46.610> doing<00:01:46.790> it<00:01:47.000> you're<00:01:47.180> getting

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
while you're doing it you're getting

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.240 
while you're doing it you're getting
another<00:01:47.900> one<00:01:48.080> ready<00:01:48.290> so<00:01:48.620> it<00:01:48.740> has<00:01:48.770> a<00:01:48.950> little<00:01:49.100> bit

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
another one ready so it has a little bit

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.730 
another one ready so it has a little bit
of<00:01:49.310> time<00:01:49.520> to<00:01:49.760> turn<00:01:50.120> react<00:01:50.590> we're<00:01:51.590> going<00:01:51.680> to

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
of time to turn react we're going to

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.080 
of time to turn react we're going to
take<00:01:51.890> this<00:01:52.070> however<00:01:52.280> now<00:01:52.610> hit<00:01:52.880> it<00:01:52.970> with<00:01:53.060> a

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
take this however now hit it with a

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:50.840 
take this however now hit it with a
brush<00:01:53.300> with<00:01:53.360> washer<00:01:53.930> see<00:01:54.560> that<00:01:54.710> we<00:01:54.800> get<00:01:54.890> it<00:01:55.010> off

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.190 

one<00:02:51.850> of<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.030> things<00:02:52.180> that<00:02:52.390> we<00:02:52.510> recommend<00:02:52.870> is

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
one of the things that we recommend is

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.720 
one of the things that we recommend is
that<00:02:53.230> you<00:02:53.410> actually<00:02:53.710> do<00:02:54.100> this<00:02:54.250> on<00:02:54.430> an<00:02:54.520> ongoing

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
that you actually do this on an ongoing

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.390 
that you actually do this on an ongoing
case<00:02:55.240> it's<00:02:55.540> not<00:02:55.720> just<00:02:55.960> the<00:02:56.050> wait<00:02:56.230> to<00:02:56.980> tell<00:02:57.250> me

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
case it's not just the wait to tell me

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.920 
case it's not just the wait to tell me
about<00:02:57.550> five<00:02:57.940> different<00:02:58.210> images<00:02:58.690> in<00:02:58.840> the

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
about five different images in the

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.450 
about five different images in the
screen<00:02:59.260> because<00:02:59.590> once<00:02:59.800> you<00:02:59.920> do<00:03:00.040> that<00:03:00.070> it

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
screen because once you do that it

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.880
