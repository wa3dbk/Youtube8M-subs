three<00:03:21.310> use<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.780> open<00:03:23.199> application<00:03:23.769> view<00:03:24.009> or

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:24.129 
three use the open application view or

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:27.240 
three use the open application view or
the<00:03:24.159> multitasking<00:03:24.970> view<00:03:25.439> the<00:03:26.439> events<00:03:26.799> feed

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
the multitasking view the events feed

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.229 
the multitasking view the events feed
and<00:03:27.579> the<00:03:28.359> application<00:03:28.900> Creed<00:03:29.669> are<00:03:30.669> actually<00:03:31.209> a

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
and the application Creed are actually a

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.689 
and the application Creed are actually a
really<00:03:31.900> nice<00:03:32.169> way<00:03:32.439> of<00:03:32.470> handling<00:03:32.799> everything

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:33.699 
really nice way of handling everything

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:36.059 
really nice way of handling everything
that<00:03:34.000> you<00:03:34.120> need<00:03:34.269> to<00:03:34.389> do<00:03:34.509> with<00:03:34.720> your<00:03:34.840> device<00:03:35.199> and

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
that you need to do with your device and

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.129 
that you need to do with your device and
the<00:03:36.159> cool<00:03:36.370> thing<00:03:36.400> is<00:03:36.549> that<00:03:36.699> for<00:03:37.659> example<00:03:38.079> the

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
the cool thing is that for example the

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:40.559 
the cool thing is that for example the
events<00:03:38.560> feed<00:03:38.919> i<00:03:39.189> would<00:03:39.430> say<00:03:39.609> compares<00:03:40.359> to

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
events feed i would say compares to

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.399 
events feed i would say compares to
let's<00:03:40.780> say<00:03:40.989> four<00:03:41.590> or<00:03:42.090> five<00:03:43.090> different

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409 
let's say four or five different

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:45.749 
let's say four or five different
applications<00:03:44.409> on<00:03:44.650> other<00:03:44.829> devices<00:03:45.099> so<00:03:45.699> you

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:45.759 
applications on other devices so you

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:48.780 
applications on other devices so you
don't<00:03:46.000> need<00:03:46.060> to<00:03:46.470> spend<00:03:47.470> so<00:03:47.709> much<00:03:47.889> time<00:03:47.949> opening

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
don't need to spend so much time opening

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.939 
don't need to spend so much time opening
and<00:03:48.970> closing<00:03:49.180> applications<00:03:50.049> you<00:03:50.229> can<00:03:50.290> just

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:50.949 
and closing applications you can just

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:53.539 
and closing applications you can just
have<00:03:51.099> them<00:03:51.129> everything<00:03:51.849> in<00:03:52.000> one<00:03:52.209> stream<00:03:52.569> and

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
have them everything in one stream and

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.670 
have them everything in one stream and
these<00:03:54.549> three<00:03:54.849> to<00:03:55.180> get<00:03:55.359> these<00:03:56.079> three<00:03:56.409> views

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
these three to get these three views

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.249 
these three to get these three views
together<00:03:57.129> are<00:03:57.459> very<00:03:58.359> intuitive<00:03:58.719> way<00:03:59.079> of

00:03:59.249 --> 00:03:59.259 
together are very intuitive way of

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:00.719 
together are very intuitive way of
handling<00:03:59.439> your<00:03:59.650> device<00:04:00.099> and<00:04:00.340> it<00:04:00.400> makes<00:04:00.609> it

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:00.729 
handling your device and it makes it

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:03.539 
handling your device and it makes it
very<00:04:00.909> easy<00:04:01.379> very<00:04:02.379> addictive<00:04:03.040> at<00:04:03.189> the<00:04:03.400> same

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
very easy very addictive at the same

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.839 
very easy very addictive at the same
time<00:04:03.729> very<00:04:03.879> powerful<00:04:04.629> so<00:04:04.959> I<00:04:05.379> think<00:04:05.650> using<00:04:06.609> a

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
time very powerful so I think using a

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:09.619 
time very powerful so I think using a
mobile<00:04:07.030> phone<00:04:07.509> has<00:04:07.780> never<00:04:08.349> been<00:04:08.590> this<00:04:09.280> fun

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629 
mobile phone has never been this fun

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:19.780 
mobile phone has never been this fun
with<00:04:10.629> done<00:04:11.019> with<00:04:11.199> the<00:04:11.409> end<00:04:11.769> on<00:04:11.919> Uline

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790
