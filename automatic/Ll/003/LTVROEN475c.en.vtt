now what you're gonna do is once you've
folded<00:02:07.570> on<00:02:07.960> all<00:02:08.170> the<00:02:08.350> score<00:02:08.679> lines<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:11.560> want

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
folded on all the score lines you want

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.320 
folded on all the score lines you want
to<00:02:12.840> line<00:02:13.840> up<00:02:14.310> we're<00:02:15.310> basically<00:02:15.670> putting<00:02:15.970> a

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
to line up we're basically putting a

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.870 
to line up we're basically putting a
square<00:02:16.750> on<00:02:17.200> a<00:02:17.260> square<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.280> that's<00:02:18.490> how<00:02:18.820> the

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
square on a square and that's how the

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.840 
square on a square and that's how the
pages<00:02:19.450> connect<00:02:20.020> to<00:02:20.230> each<00:02:20.380> other<00:02:20.620> so<00:02:21.520> on<00:02:21.700> the

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
pages connect to each other so on the

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.330 
pages connect to each other so on the
backside<00:02:22.090> of<00:02:22.420> this<00:02:22.720> panel<00:02:23.080> you<00:02:23.500> will<00:02:23.980> want<00:02:24.250> to

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
backside of this panel you will want to

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.520 
backside of this panel you will want to
put<00:02:24.580> sticky<00:02:24.970> strip<00:02:25.270> or<00:02:25.480> a<00:02:25.510> really<00:02:26.020> strong

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
put sticky strip or a really strong

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.890 
put sticky strip or a really strong
adhesive<00:02:27.160> and<00:02:28.260> then<00:02:30.150> lay<00:02:31.150> it<00:02:31.180> down<00:02:31.360> there<00:02:31.720> like

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
adhesive and then lay it down there like

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.530 
adhesive and then lay it down there like
so<00:02:32.380> to<00:02:32.739> connect<00:02:33.130> it<00:02:33.340> now<00:02:33.550> I've<00:02:34.239> already

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
so to connect it now I've already

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.740 
so to connect it now I've already
connected<00:02:34.870> three<00:02:35.380> sheets<00:02:35.709> together<00:02:36.220> and<00:02:36.750> this

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
connected three sheets together and this

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.680 
connected three sheets together and this
is<00:02:37.810> what<00:02:38.140> it<00:02:38.290> looks<00:02:38.530> like<00:02:39.209> okay<00:02:40.209> so<00:02:40.270> here's<00:02:40.630> the

to fold it up is I start with one end i
press<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:50.280> triangular<00:02:51.280> areas<00:02:51.610> in<00:02:51.850> so<00:02:52.750> I've

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
press the triangular areas in so I've

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.190 
press the triangular areas in so I've
got<00:02:53.020> this<00:02:53.290> I'm<00:02:54.070> gonna<00:02:54.280> flip<00:02:54.640> it<00:02:54.790> over<00:02:55.050> and<00:02:56.050> now

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.930 
go
all<00:03:52.420> right<00:03:52.600> I'm<00:03:53.260> pulling<00:03:53.920> up<00:03:54.100> both<00:03:54.519> of<00:03:54.549> the

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
all right I'm pulling up both of the

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.449 
all right I'm pulling up both of the
corners<00:03:55.269> so<00:03:56.049> I<00:03:56.079> have<00:03:56.350> this<00:03:56.620> little<00:03:56.680> flappy

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
corners so I have this little flappy

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.850 
corners so I have this little flappy
piece<00:03:57.700> now<00:03:58.510> all<00:03:58.660> I<00:03:58.690> have<00:03:58.959> to<00:03:59.079> do<00:03:59.230> is<00:03:59.440> cut<00:03:59.709> that

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
piece now all I have to do is cut that

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.370 
piece now all I have to do is cut that
off<00:04:02.700> that<00:04:03.700> white<00:04:03.910> so

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
off that white so

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.860 
off that white so
so<00:04:05.890> then<00:04:06.100> when<00:04:06.280> we<00:04:06.400> go<00:04:06.580> to<00:04:06.640> fold<00:04:07.180> our<00:04:07.390> corners

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
so then when we go to fold our corners

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.520 
so then when we go to fold our corners
in<00:04:08.730> you<00:04:09.730> have<00:04:09.880> a<00:04:09.910> really<00:04:10.510> nice<00:04:10.720> corner<00:04:11.290> and<00:04:11.470> if

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
in you have a really nice corner and if

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.020 
in you have a really nice corner and if
I've<00:04:11.650> got<00:04:11.800> a<00:04:11.830> little<00:04:12.040> extra<00:04:12.220> there<00:04:12.520> I<00:04:12.550> can<00:04:12.850> just

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
I've got a little extra there I can just

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
off the extra that you get the idea

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.990 
off the extra that you get the idea
so<00:04:32.800> that's<00:04:33.010> what<00:04:33.190> you're<00:04:33.340> gonna<00:04:33.430> do<00:04:33.730> and

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
you're gonna wrap around all four sides

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.720 
you're gonna wrap around all four sides
and<00:04:36.990> adhere<00:04:37.990> it<00:04:38.020> down<00:04:38.290> now<00:04:39.130> the<00:04:39.190> reason<00:04:39.610> why<00:04:39.700> I

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
and adhere it down now the reason why I

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.150 

let's<00:05:49.570> put<00:05:49.840> some<00:05:50.080> on<00:05:50.110> there<00:05:50.500> just<00:05:50.620> to<00:05:50.800> hold<00:05:50.950> it

let's put some on there just to hold it
in<00:05:51.280> place<00:05:51.520> and<00:05:52.030> then<00:05:52.180> we're<00:05:52.900> basically<00:05:53.290> going

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
in place and then we're basically going

00:05:53.560 --> 00:06:03.290 
in place and then we're basically going
to<00:05:53.650> add<00:05:53.800> the<00:05:54.010> front<00:05:54.190> cover<00:05:54.520> the<00:05:54.820> same<00:05:55.150> way

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.670 

we're<00:06:04.300> just<00:06:04.330> gonna<00:06:04.600> be<00:06:04.780> squashing<00:06:05.530> those

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
we're just gonna be squashing those

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:11.339

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:20.569 
all right so we'll peel this off now I

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:22.689 
all right so we'll peel this off now I
always<00:06:21.109> tell<00:06:21.319> people<00:06:21.499> to<00:06:21.889> have<00:06:22.249> it<00:06:22.429> where<00:06:22.579> the

00:06:24.609 --> 00:06:24.619 
opening is kind of this bottom right

00:06:24.619 --> 00:06:27.339 
opening is kind of this bottom right
area<00:06:25.419> so<00:06:26.419> we're<00:06:26.539> gonna<00:06:26.659> stick<00:06:26.989> that<00:06:27.019> on<00:06:27.319> there

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:27.349 
area so we're gonna stick that on there

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:31.769 
area so we're gonna stick that on there
like<00:06:28.869> that

00:06:31.769 --> 00:06:31.779
