you can just chop it in half be part of

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.000 
you can just chop it in half be part of
it

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
it

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:04.960 
it
like<00:00:54.340> this

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.760 

so<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.060> just<00:01:06.180> pick<00:01:06.450> bits<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.930> pieces<00:01:07.110> but

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
so you just pick bits and pieces but

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.469 
so you just pick bits and pieces but
here's<00:01:07.979> how<00:01:08.159> we<00:01:08.220> actually<00:01:08.580> do<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:08.909> it's<00:01:09.240> one<00:01:09.390> of

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
here's how we actually do it it's one of

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.620 
here's how we actually do it it's one of
the<00:01:09.540> simplest<00:01:10.080> licks<00:01:10.380> around<00:01:10.860> okay<00:01:11.759> these<00:01:12.360> are

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
the simplest licks around okay these are

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.039 
the simplest licks around okay these are
all<00:01:12.659> what<00:01:13.020> are<00:01:13.049> called<00:01:13.470> pull<00:01:14.009> offs<00:01:14.600> okay<00:01:15.600> so

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
all what are called pull offs okay so

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.649 
all what are called pull offs okay so
we're<00:01:16.170> gonna<00:01:16.259> start<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.830> high<00:01:16.979> E<00:01:17.009> string

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
we're gonna start on the high E string

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.300 
we're gonna start on the high E string
okay<00:01:18.689> we're<00:01:19.229> gonna<00:01:19.320> play<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.770> third<00:01:19.979> fret

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
middle finger all the way down so here's

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.679 
middle finger all the way down so here's
what<00:01:27.689> we've<00:01:27.840> got<00:01:27.899> we<00:01:28.170> pick<00:01:28.380> at<00:01:28.530> once<00:01:29.539> pull<00:01:30.539> it

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
what we've got we pick at once pull it

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
off and then pull that one off to open

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.499 
off and then pull that one off to open
take<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.200> three<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:35.580> one<00:01:36.380> you're<00:01:37.380> actually

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
take a three to one you're actually

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.210 
take a three to one you're actually
picking<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.960> string<00:01:40.350> as<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.740> let<00:01:40.890> off<00:01:41.039> each

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
picking that string as you let off each

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.550 
picking that string as you let off each
one<00:01:43.429> each<00:01:44.429> so<00:01:45.179> your<00:01:45.330> fingers<00:01:45.720> here<00:01:45.899> when<00:01:46.530> I

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
one each so your fingers here when I

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.330 
one each so your fingers here when I
pull<00:01:46.920> off<00:01:47.100> two<00:01:47.399> from<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:47.850> first<00:01:48.179> note<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:49.340> pick

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
pull off two from this first note I pick

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.210 
pull off two from this first note I pick
it<00:01:50.549> then<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.509> pick<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.080> again<00:01:52.380> with<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.619> finger

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
it then I pick it again with that finger

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.370 
it then I pick it again with that finger
okay<00:01:54.000> I'm<00:01:54.149> over-exaggerating<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:55.200> because

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
okay I'm over-exaggerating it because

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.410 
okay I'm over-exaggerating it because
it's<00:01:55.530> actually<00:01:55.649> easier<00:01:56.250> than<00:01:56.369> this<00:01:56.789> it<00:01:57.270> will

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
it's actually easier than this it will

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.149 
it's actually easier than this it will
take<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.630> while<00:01:57.869> for<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.319> to<00:01:58.350> get<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:58.860> down

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
take a while for you to get this down

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.090 
take a while for you to get this down
that's<00:01:59.880> why<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.179> practice<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:01.380> can<00:02:01.560> pause<00:02:02.069> it

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
that's why you practice you can pause it

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.639 
that's why you practice you can pause it
here<00:02:02.340> in<00:02:02.640> about<00:02:02.850> 30<00:02:03.780> seconds<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.470> actually

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
here in about 30 seconds and actually

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.440 
here in about 30 seconds and actually
get<00:02:04.950> this<00:02:05.069> thing<00:02:05.369> down<00:02:05.580> it'd<00:02:06.000> probably<00:02:06.149> take

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
get this thing down it'd probably take

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.060 
get this thing down it'd probably take
about<00:02:06.539> an<00:02:06.750> hour<00:02:06.929> to<00:02:07.229> actually<00:02:07.380> get<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:07.799> down

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
about an hour to actually get this down

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:14.730 
about an hour to actually get this down
correctly

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:21.940 

so<00:02:15.550> you're<00:02:15.700> only<00:02:15.790> using<00:02:15.910> your<00:02:16.210> pick<00:02:16.450> one<00:02:16.660> time

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.100 

and<00:02:22.580> that's<00:02:23.030> what<00:02:23.180> we're<00:02:23.300> doing<00:02:23.569> all<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:24.020> way

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
and that's what we're doing all the way

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.380 
and that's what we're doing all the way
on<00:02:24.380> each<00:02:24.620> string<00:02:25.130> every<00:02:25.550> string<00:02:25.849> the<00:02:26.000> exact

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
on each string every string the exact

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.300 
on each string every string the exact
same<00:02:26.690> thing<00:02:27.140> okay

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
same thing okay
