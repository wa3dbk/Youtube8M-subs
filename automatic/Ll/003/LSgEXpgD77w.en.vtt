 parents who have filmed so many 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.990

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.360
 a cultural musical background 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.100

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.390
 honored because we made use of the 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.520

 first time as a great actress but there 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.600
 even need to say it and it becomes magic 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.040
 Direct leila video clips so for me it 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.660
 It was an honor first of all to turn the 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.220
 clip of my music piece but 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.440
 especially having been directed by her 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.070
 which is really important together 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.070
 Very good 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.130
 and how the idea of ​​this new was born 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.460
 single trained more than anything else because 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.800
 lover of dance music from the 70s 80s 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.750
 I started taking sounds and I have 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.280
 started to split things up a bit because 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.170
 however I didn't do a dance song 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.000
 I did dance dance for it 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.110
 massa that is the typical piece that if you do 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.480
 listen on the radio you like 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.140
 listen to it and then it makes you the journey is 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.490
 at work 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.680
 I have not done a thing for the rich and I 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.700
 tried to do one thing more than another 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.700
 will try to snatch a smile 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.310
 compared to the past since you decided 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.409
 to engage with the career of dj sai 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.290
 selecting the places where you are going to 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:03.000
 sound obvious obvious obvious requests 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.769
 are so many due to the various reality shows 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.510
 off to the reality show to the performances 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.310

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.200
 and doing this job for quite a while 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.220
 because anyway since I was born 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.510
 I listen to music 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.120
