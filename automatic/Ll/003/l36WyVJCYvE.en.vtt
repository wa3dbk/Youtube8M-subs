00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
I'm ready to get started thanks for

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.450 
I'm ready to get started thanks for
joining<00:00:30.809> me<00:00:31.140> let's<00:00:31.829> go<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.279> sewing

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
joining me let's go to the sewing

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.299 
joining me let's go to the sewing
machine<00:00:33.110> hopin<00:00:34.110> when<00:00:34.260> I'm<00:00:34.380> sewing<00:00:34.679> blocks<00:00:35.100> I

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
machine hopin when I'm sewing blocks I

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.639 
machine hopin when I'm sewing blocks I
look<00:00:35.489> for<00:00:35.699> pieces<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.329> can<00:00:36.600> combine<00:00:37.079> so

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
look for pieces that I can combine so

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.979 
look for pieces that I can combine so
that<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:37.829> don't<00:00:37.949> have<00:00:38.160> as<00:00:38.460> many<00:00:38.579> seams<00:00:39.059> in<00:00:39.390> the

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
that I don't have as many seams in the

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.209 
that I don't have as many seams in the
block<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.699> what<00:00:42.089> I<00:00:42.120> did<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.899> was<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.980> take<00:00:44.190> a

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
block and so what I did I was to take a

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.910 
block and so what I did I was to take a
look<00:00:44.519> at<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.239> rotary<00:00:45.870> cutting<00:00:46.170> instructions

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
look at the rotary cutting instructions

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.430 
look at the rotary cutting instructions
and<00:00:47.249> I<00:00:48.149> could<00:00:48.359> see<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.719> in<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.079> center<00:00:49.410> of

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
and I could see that in the center of

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.160 
and I could see that in the center of
these<00:00:49.949> stars<00:00:50.670> there's<00:00:51.179> some<00:00:51.480> therefore

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
these stars there's some therefore

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.790 
these stars there's some therefore
little<00:00:52.980> square<00:00:53.820> patches<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:55.350> instead<00:00:55.739> of

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
little square patches and so instead of

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.680 
little square patches and so instead of
cutting<00:00:56.039> for<00:00:56.429> individual<00:00:57.030> two<00:00:57.359> and<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.510> half

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
cutting for individual two and a half

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.040 
cutting for individual two and a half
inch<00:00:57.839> squares<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.589> cut<00:00:59.280> one<00:00:59.309> large<00:01:00.120> for<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.839> nap

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
inch squares I cut one large for a nap

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.919 
inch squares I cut one large for a nap
inch<00:01:01.289> square<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.890> then<00:01:02.789> my<00:01:03.239> markings<00:01:03.719> here

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:03.929 
inch square and then my markings here

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:06.230 
inch square and then my markings here
show<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.320> I've<00:01:04.710> got<00:01:05.159> four<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.640> those<00:01:05.820> and

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
show that I've got four of those and

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.020 
show that I've got four of those and
then<00:01:06.899> also<00:01:07.079> I<00:01:07.350> saw<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.040> could<00:01:08.070> combine<00:01:08.520> two

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
then also I saw that I could combine two

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.670 
then also I saw that I could combine two
patches<00:01:09.329> and<00:01:09.899> cut<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.970> angle<00:01:11.970> that's<00:01:12.180> two<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.840> a

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
patches and cut a angle that's two and a

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.319 
patches and cut a angle that's two and a
half<00:01:13.829> inches<00:01:14.009> by<00:01:14.430> four<00:01:14.759> and<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.909> half<00:01:14.939> inches

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:15.329 
half inches by four and a half inches

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:18.620 
half inches by four and a half inches
and<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.409> put<00:01:16.649> little<00:01:16.829> circles<00:01:17.369> there<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.030> so

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
and so I put little circles there and so

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.620 
and so I put little circles there and so
that's<00:01:18.930> why<00:01:19.259> on<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.729> flat<00:01:20.729> board<00:01:21.119> you'll<00:01:21.329> see

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
that's why on the flat board you'll see

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.730 
that's why on the flat board you'll see
different<00:01:21.810> shapes<00:01:23.450> my<00:01:24.450> first<00:01:24.780> step<00:01:25.110> though<00:01:25.409> is

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
different shapes my first step though is

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.679 
different shapes my first step though is
to<00:01:25.829> sow<00:01:26.310> all<00:01:26.610> these<00:01:26.670> little<00:01:27.119> half<00:01:27.390> square

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
to sow all these little half square

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.560 
to sow all these little half square
triangles<00:01:28.350> together<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:29.130> instead<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.270> laying

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
triangles together and instead of laying

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.450 
triangles together and instead of laying
them<00:01:30.810> out<00:01:30.960> I've<00:01:31.259> just<00:01:31.500> stacked<00:01:31.829> them<00:01:32.039> up<00:01:32.159> so

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
them out I've just stacked them up so

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.029 
them out I've just stacked them up so
I've<00:01:32.520> got<00:01:32.759> red<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.810> white<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.380> blue<00:01:34.860> and

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
I've got red and white and blue and

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:37.429 
I've got red and white and blue and
white<00:01:35.189> half<00:01:35.490> square<00:01:35.789> triangles<00:01:36.299> together<00:01:36.509> so

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
white half square triangles together so

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.590 
white half square triangles together so
I'll<00:01:37.619> just<00:01:37.649> put<00:01:38.579> them<00:01:38.789> right<00:01:39.060> sides<00:01:39.329> together

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
I'll just put them right sides together

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.020 
I'll just put them right sides together
and<00:01:41.030> stitch<00:01:42.030> on<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.270> long<00:01:42.630> end<00:01:43.820> now<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:44.969> I

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
and stitch on the long end now that I

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.969 
and stitch on the long end now that I
have<00:01:45.180> my<00:01:45.210> patches<00:01:45.570> all<00:01:45.899> laid<00:01:46.140> out<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.649> there

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
have my patches all laid out in there

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.679 
have my patches all laid out in there
and<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.430> half<00:01:47.609> square<00:01:47.850> triangles<00:01:48.479> are<00:01:48.600> all

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
and the half square triangles are all

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.230 
and the half square triangles are all
sewn<00:01:48.960> together<00:01:49.200> it's<00:01:49.619> time<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.070> decide<00:01:50.549> how

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
sewn together it's time to decide how

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.410 
sewn together it's time to decide how
i'm<00:01:51.420> going<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.630> sew<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.789> patches<00:01:53.789> together<00:01:54.119> to

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
i'm going to sew the patches together to

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.840 
i'm going to sew the patches together to
complete<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.109> block<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.520> first<00:01:56.759> thing

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
complete the block so the first thing

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.050 
complete the block so the first thing
I'm<00:01:57.060> going<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.240> do<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.570> take<00:01:57.750> all<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.049> these

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
I'm going to do is take all of these

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.990 
I'm going to do is take all of these
little<00:02:00.060> units<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.109> sew<00:02:01.530> them<00:02:01.560> together<00:02:02.009> and

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
little units and sew them together and
