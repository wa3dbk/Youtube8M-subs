00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.750
 wc point at the meeting time 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.840
 the attack of the button with the drive has 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:26.120
 a formidable response tied down that 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.400
 puts tell the ramones plan 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.080
 in an hour of the game captures the 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.880
 first partial against Juan Martin 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.880
 colt 7 to 5 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.589
 I remember like when he played in wimbledon 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:48.190
 I also make the reservation that maybe 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:48.190
 is for more 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:58.910
 to see if it stings you to touch one no no 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.910
 I say no no no double pique arrived 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:17.899
 it is an error 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:22.000
 galliani but can not use that 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.000
 repetition to sanction 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:30.860
 if you think about the network how it stays like 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.119
 a moving 6 and the referee that is going to 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.909
 look, look at the network that moves and 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.780
 in the particular situation that occurred and 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.780
 new break point 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:50.180
 if we look 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.180
 but these smiles 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.829
 the issue is that he is in a situation 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.829
 Super delicate foal now 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.430
 we go triple match point 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.820
 falcon for this 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.810
 how many circumstances the identity is 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.050
 the most 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.530
 confirmed triple match contains videos 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.530

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.150
 of the colt 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:22.050
 and reaches the quarterfinals two 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:26.190
 Canadians in the same instance one 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.910
 48 minutes of play for this 7-5 and
