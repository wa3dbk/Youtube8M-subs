updating our laptops and I found that
this<00:00:16.650> little<00:00:17.039> gem<00:00:17.480> worked<00:00:18.480> really<00:00:18.779> well<00:00:18.930> for

me<00:00:19.560> it's<00:00:20.520> kind<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.090> kind<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.449> in<00:00:21.840> between<00:00:22.109> an

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
me it's kind of a kind of in between an

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.630 
me it's kind of a kind of in between an
iPad<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.119> laptop<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.680> about<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.369> same

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640

longer<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:29.279> little<00:00:29.820> bit<00:00:30.029> thicker<00:00:30.359> so<00:00:30.779> it's

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
longer a little bit thicker so it's

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.889 
longer a little bit thicker so it's
going<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.260> weigh<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.590> little<00:00:31.830> bit<00:00:32.040> more<00:00:32.250> as<00:00:32.399> well

it onto itself and then the keyboard
goes<00:02:04.070> dormant<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:06.270> can<00:02:06.509> either<00:02:06.869> just

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.740 
have it to come up in desktop view or
the<00:03:27.060> standard<00:03:27.630> Windows<00:03:28.530> 8<00:03:29.280> view<00:03:29.970> with<00:03:30.599> all

your apps I'll just touch my desktop and
now<00:03:34.470> that<00:03:34.709> looks<00:03:35.069> more<00:03:35.280> like<00:03:35.549> the<00:03:35.760> old<00:03:36.200> Windows

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
now that looks more like the old Windows

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.180 
now that looks more like the old Windows
system<00:03:38.670> that<00:03:38.849> were<00:03:39.000> you<00:03:39.209> this<00:03:39.720> pen<00:03:40.079> comes<00:03:40.739> with

system that were you this pen comes with
the<00:03:41.609> surface<00:03:42.090> pro<00:03:42.389> 2<00:03:42.859> actually<00:03:43.859> all<00:03:44.250> of<00:03:44.430> the

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
the surface pro 2 actually all of the

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.449 
the surface pro 2 actually all of the
surface<00:03:45.000> pros<00:03:45.359> and<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:46.620> nice<00:03:46.799> thing<00:03:47.099> is<00:03:47.130> is

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
surface pros and the nice thing is is

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.520 
surface pros and the nice thing is is
that<00:03:47.639> it's<00:03:48.209> a<00:03:48.419> high<00:03:50.599> high<00:03:51.599> stance<00:03:52.019> of<00:03:52.349> this

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
that it's a high high stance of this

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.770 
that it's a high high stance of this
button<00:03:52.739> so<00:03:53.069> it's<00:03:53.730> much<00:03:53.970> more<00:03:54.000> comfortable<00:03:54.720> to

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
button so it's much more comfortable to

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.089 
button so it's much more comfortable to
be<00:03:54.959> able<00:03:55.079> to<00:03:55.290> use<00:03:55.650> for<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.639> right-click

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
be able to use for the right-click

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.640 
be able to use for the right-click
screens<00:03:59.099> that<00:03:59.459> we<00:03:59.669> use<00:03:59.880> a<00:03:59.910> lot<00:04:00.150> of<00:04:00.329> in<00:04:00.720> art<00:04:01.530> and

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
screens that we use a lot of in art and

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.629 
screens that we use a lot of in art and
stitch<00:04:02.120> the<00:04:03.120> little<00:04:03.389> tip<00:04:03.660> is<00:04:03.900> nice<00:04:04.319> for<00:04:04.829> actual

to go ahead and just grab a backdrop the

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.759 
to go ahead and just grab a backdrop the
nice<00:04:17.070> thing<00:04:17.370> is<00:04:17.609> is<00:04:17.849> that<00:04:18.030> we<00:04:18.180> can<00:04:18.389> go<00:04:18.630> use<00:04:19.530> the

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
nice thing is is that we can go use the

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.520 
nice thing is is that we can go use the
pencil<00:04:20.220> drawing<00:04:20.789> tool<00:04:21.269> and<00:04:21.599> I<00:04:22.049> can<00:04:22.109> actually

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
pencil drawing tool and I can actually

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.850 
pencil drawing tool and I can actually
just<00:04:23.099> come<00:04:24.030> right<00:04:24.599> on<00:04:24.900> to<00:04:25.890> the

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
just come right on to the

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.409 
just come right on to the
photo<00:04:27.819> and<00:04:28.919> actually<00:04:29.919> trace<00:04:30.490> right<00:04:30.729> on<00:04:30.909> top<00:04:31.210> of

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
photo and actually trace right on top of

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:37.230 
photo and actually trace right on top of
there<00:04:31.629> and<00:04:32.129> you<00:04:33.129> can<00:04:33.340> see<00:04:33.729> that<00:04:35.580> having<00:04:36.580> the

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
there and you can see that having the

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.309 
there and you can see that having the
pen<00:04:37.599> really<00:04:38.590> does<00:04:39.389> make<00:04:40.389> a<00:04:40.449> difference<00:04:40.599> in

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:41.319 
pen really does make a difference in

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:45.990 
pen really does make a difference in
that<00:04:41.919> drawing<00:04:43.620> obviously<00:04:44.620> I<00:04:44.650> did<00:04:44.919> it<00:04:45.099> very

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
that drawing obviously I did it very

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.879 
that drawing obviously I did it very
quickly<00:04:46.330> but<00:04:47.199> you<00:04:47.409> can<00:04:47.590> see<00:04:47.889> that<00:04:49.680> you<00:04:50.680> can

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
quickly but you can see that you can

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.140 
quickly but you can see that you can
make<00:04:51.069> a<00:04:51.280> fairly<00:04:52.409> nice<00:04:53.409> drawing<00:04:53.919> in<00:04:54.219> a<00:04:54.849> very

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
make a fairly nice drawing in a very

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.779 
make a fairly nice drawing in a very
quick<00:04:55.479> period<00:04:55.780> of<00:04:56.020> time<00:04:56.259> you<00:04:56.439> know<00:04:56.830> I<00:04:56.860> would<00:04:57.219> go

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:57.789 
quick period of time you know I would go

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:00.659 
quick period of time you know I would go
back<00:04:58.090> and<00:04:58.360> I<00:04:58.629> would<00:04:58.840> actually<00:04:59.189> activate<00:05:00.189> the

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
back and I would actually activate the

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.080 
back and I would actually activate the
reshape<00:05:01.090> mode<00:05:01.360> and<00:05:01.689> I<00:05:02.289> would<00:05:02.529> take<00:05:03.090> these

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
reshape mode and I would take these

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.830 
reshape mode and I would take these
nodes<00:05:04.870> I<00:05:05.349> can<00:05:06.279> use<00:05:06.490> the<00:05:07.180> the<00:05:08.009> toggle<00:05:09.009> switch

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
nodes I can use the the toggle switch

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.050 
nodes I can use the the toggle switch
click<00:05:10.840> on<00:05:11.080> the<00:05:11.379> page<00:05:11.680> and<00:05:12.009> now<00:05:12.490> we<00:05:12.550> can<00:05:12.819> see

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
click on the page and now we can see
