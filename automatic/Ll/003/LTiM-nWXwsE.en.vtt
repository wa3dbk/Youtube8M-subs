00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.270
 and there are very good people that such 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:14.049
 how are you welcome to a new 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:16.299
 tutorial on how to make a trap 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.789
 tnt in a chest 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.920
 we have the chest to remove the 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.599
 trap and good is a normal chest and 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.349
 current has absolutely nothing of 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:30.410
 weird is neither an animal nor has anything 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:32.770
 below it's worth as you see it does not have any 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.579
 it is undetectable, it does not have anything 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:40.039
 even themselves 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.039
 reactivate with only the risk 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.719
 today it is active dormant and there we go 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:54.950
 well pretty good and good let's see 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.270
 how it is done for this is very simple 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:01.970
 the drawings are going to be two chests 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:06.970
 torch a comparator and let's visit 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.970
 and inside the chest 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.610
 over here like this 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.940
 so and so they did not activate our eyes 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.940
 that is worth first of all that our 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.190
 cheat trap and here will go two more 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.780
 what's worth inside this chest is going to go 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.640
 item is worth anything serves us 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.490
 and as you see 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.490
 here we are going to draw a comparator and a 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.830
 Reston torch is well worth it 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.890
 normal is worth the comparator is 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.619
 detecting an item inside here and it's 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.479
 firing a negative terrestrial signal 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.550
 ok but now friends if we put a 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:53.120
 block over and we open this 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.670
 changes for some reason the comparator is 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.050
 updates and no longer detects that there is nothing 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.960
 OK 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.840
 so we can open and updated 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.050
 updated data if we put the 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.710
 blocks and safe and good here and our 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.470
 tnt here and here and good because 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.810
 wherever I want, I always put or 6 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.880
 it's a good amount and you can put 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.810
 another torch happens that now changes 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.560
 one second 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.430
 A) Yes 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.840
 Y 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:32.459
 and here would be blogs 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:32.459
 perfect conjunction of cnt 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.129
 I'm sure I hope you liked it 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.129
 this trap
