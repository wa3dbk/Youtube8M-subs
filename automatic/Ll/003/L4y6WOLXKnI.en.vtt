00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
home depot down here we have our wires

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:25.220 
home depot down here we have our wires
for<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.529> sensors<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:23.630> valve<00:00:24.630> assembly

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
for the sensors and the valve assembly

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.080 
for the sensors and the valve assembly
all<00:00:26.220> three<00:00:26.609> these<00:00:27.230> you<00:00:28.230> probably<00:00:28.560> have<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.859> get

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
all three these you probably have to get

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.319 
all three these you probably have to get
some<00:00:30.090> sort<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.710> tube<00:00:31.710> in<00:00:31.969> to<00:00:32.969> connect<00:00:33.270> with

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
some sort of tube in to connect with

this 38 21 inch manifold and assembly to
run<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.710> from<00:00:40.980> your<00:00:41.309> existing<00:00:42.379> ticket<00:00:43.379> or

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
run it from your existing ticket or

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.920 
run it from your existing ticket or
outside<00:00:44.489> faucet<00:00:45.350> basically<00:00:46.850> having<00:00:47.930> this

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
outside faucet basically having this

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.590 
outside faucet basically having this
setup<00:00:49.200> like<00:00:49.469> this<00:00:49.530> we've<00:00:50.399> got<00:00:50.610> one<00:00:50.910> two<00:00:50.940> three

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
setup like this we've got one two three

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.799 
setup like this we've got one two three
so<00:00:51.899> I've<00:00:51.989> got<00:00:52.170> three<00:00:52.469> zones<00:00:52.789> users<00:00:53.789> own<00:00:53.969> is

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
so I've got three zones users own is

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.860
