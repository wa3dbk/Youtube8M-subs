purpose of conserving energy the usage
of<00:00:58.559> air<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:59.070> very<00:00:59.579> critical<00:00:59.820> today<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.719> we

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
of air is very critical today and we

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.720 
of air is very critical today and we
have<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.379> means<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.710> measure<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.579> also

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
have the means to measure that and also

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.600 
have the means to measure that and also
to<00:01:02.969> alert<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.629> operator<00:01:03.660> if<00:01:04.350> air<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.280> being

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
to alert the operator if air is being

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.820 
to alert the operator if air is being
consumed<00:01:06.090> which<00:01:06.659> could<00:01:06.900> mean<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.409> an

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
consumed which could mean that an

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.219 
consumed which could mean that an
airline<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.400> broken<00:01:08.850> or<00:01:09.030> something<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:10.049> not

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
airline is broken or something is not

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.859 
airline is broken or something is not
connected<00:01:10.740> properly<00:01:10.979> as<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.460> should<00:01:11.700> be<00:01:11.880> other

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
connected properly as it should be other

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.200 
connected properly as it should be other
machines<00:01:13.380> or<00:01:13.740> other<00:01:13.860> systems<00:01:14.340> do<00:01:14.640> not<00:01:14.670> allow

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
machines or other systems do not allow

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.600 
machines or other systems do not allow
that<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:16.140> information<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.740> be<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.100> readily

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
that that information to be so readily

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.070 
that that information to be so readily
available<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.330> there's<00:01:18.509> an<00:01:18.630> advantage<00:01:18.869> to

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
available so there's an advantage to

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.590 
available so there's an advantage to
this<00:01:19.409> system<00:01:19.939> same<00:01:20.939> thing<00:01:21.119> with<00:01:21.240> energy

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
this system same thing with energy

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.080 
this system same thing with energy
consumption<00:01:22.200> we're<00:01:22.350> able<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.820> measure<00:01:23.820> the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
consumption we're able to measure the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.640 
consumption we're able to measure the
amount<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.330> energy<00:01:24.540> that's<00:01:24.900> being<00:01:24.990> used<00:01:25.200> power

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
amount of energy that's being used power

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.249 
amount of energy that's being used power
consumption<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.720> that's<00:01:27.720> also<00:01:28.110> very

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
consumption and that's also very

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.460 
consumption and that's also very
important<00:01:28.860> as<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.820> relates<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.470> understanding

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
important as it relates to understanding

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.800 
important as it relates to understanding
if<00:01:31.619> something<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.130> not<00:01:32.689> operating<00:01:33.689> properly

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
if something is not operating properly

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.920 
if something is not operating properly
we<00:01:34.619> can<00:01:34.770> determine<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.400> from<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.939> power

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
we can determine that from the power

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.680 
we can determine that from the power
consumption<00:01:37.380> as<00:01:37.650> well
