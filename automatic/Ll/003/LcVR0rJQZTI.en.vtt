the creator's done a really good job of
making<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:40.079> authentic<00:00:40.950> obviously<00:00:41.370> doesn't

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
making this authentic obviously doesn't

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.650 
making this authentic obviously doesn't
have<00:00:41.700> all<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.060> the<00:00:42.180> props<00:00:42.480> that<00:00:43.220> you<00:00:44.220> do<00:00:44.370> have

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.270 
have all of the props that you do have
but<00:00:45.660> he's<00:00:46.170> done<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.320> really<00:00:46.560> good<00:00:46.829> job<00:00:46.890> of

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
but he's done a really good job of

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.420 
but he's done a really good job of
making<00:00:47.310> this<00:00:47.870> pretty<00:00:48.870> much<00:00:49.170> identical<00:00:49.710> to

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
making this pretty much identical to

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.920 
making this pretty much identical to
what<00:00:50.579> black<00:00:50.850> ops<00:00:52.520> new<00:00:53.520> town<00:00:53.850> map<00:00:54.420> looks<00:00:54.690> like

what black ops new town map looks like
there's<00:00:55.110> some<00:00:55.230> slight<00:00:55.530> variations<00:00:56.340> but<00:00:56.780> for

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
there's some slight variations but for

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:06.530 
there's some slight variations but for
the<00:00:57.840> most<00:00:58.020> part<00:00:59.420> he's<00:01:00.420> nailed<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:05.540> means

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
the most part he's nailed it that means

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.399 
the most part he's nailed it that means
very<00:01:06.630> simple<00:01:07.140> map<00:01:07.320> very<00:01:08.100> easy<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.549> recreate

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
very simple map very easy to recreate

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.210 
very simple map very easy to recreate
there's<00:01:10.409> no<00:01:10.620> kind<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.070> added<00:01:11.479> details<00:01:13.220> but

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
there's no kind of added details but

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.370 
there's no kind of added details but
this<00:01:14.610> has<00:01:14.760> been<00:01:14.940> well<00:01:15.150> played<00:01:15.510> on<00:01:15.840> Far<00:01:16.110> Cry<00:01:16.290> 3

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
this has been well played on Far Cry 3

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.340 
this has been well played on Far Cry 3
there's<00:01:16.920> been<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.100> lot<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.310> players<00:01:18.170> voting<00:01:19.170> for

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
there's been a lot of players voting for

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.800 
there's been a lot of players voting for
this<00:01:19.440> map<00:01:19.909> and<00:01:20.909> I'm<00:01:21.299> sure<00:01:21.510> there's<00:01:21.720> probably

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
this map and I'm sure there's probably

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.440 
this map and I'm sure there's probably
many<00:01:22.170> others<00:01:22.500> as<00:01:22.710> well<00:01:22.850> they've<00:01:23.850> been<00:01:24.030> created

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
many others as well they've been created

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.730 
many others as well they've been created
but<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.659> think<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.200> probably<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.560> most

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
but I think this is probably the most

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:33.050 
but I think this is probably the most
accurate<00:01:26.780> representation<00:01:30.350> so<00:01:31.350> that's<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:32.060> nuke

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
accurate representation so that's a nuke

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.429 
accurate representation so that's a nuke
town<00:01:33.860> remade<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:35.159> Far<00:01:35.400> Cry<00:01:35.610> 3<00:01:36.080> very<00:01:37.080> easy<00:01:37.200> to

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
town remade in Far Cry 3 very easy to

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.580 
town remade in Far Cry 3 very easy to
spot<00:01:37.740> when<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.820> search<00:01:39.240> for<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.570> in<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.750> game

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590
