micro guide rods now last year I saw him

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.640 
micro guide rods now last year I saw him
at<00:00:13.099> ICAST<00:00:13.519> and<00:00:14.019> when<00:00:15.019> I<00:00:15.049> knew<00:00:15.259> we<00:00:15.410> were<00:00:15.559> gonna

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
at ICAST and when I knew we were gonna

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.670 
at ICAST and when I knew we were gonna
come<00:00:15.860> out<00:00:16.009> with<00:00:16.219> the<00:00:17.150> micro<00:00:17.720> guides<00:00:17.960> I<00:00:18.289> didn't

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
come out with the micro guides I didn't

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.380 
come out with the micro guides I didn't
think<00:00:18.770> it<00:00:18.949> was<00:00:19.039> a<00:00:19.100> real<00:00:19.310> big<00:00:19.490> deal<00:00:19.730> but<00:00:20.240> then

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
think it was a real big deal but then

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.090 
think it was a real big deal but then
when<00:00:20.570> I<00:00:20.600> saw<00:00:20.930> the<00:00:20.990> rods<00:00:21.320> and<00:00:21.500> got<00:00:21.590> to<00:00:21.710> feel<00:00:21.920> them

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
when I saw the rods and got to feel them

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.580 
when I saw the rods and got to feel them
at<00:00:22.550> ICAST<00:00:23.029> I<00:00:23.240> could<00:00:23.960> not<00:00:24.080> believe<00:00:24.199> how<00:00:24.470> much

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
at ICAST I could not believe how much

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.920 
at ICAST I could not believe how much
lighter<00:00:24.920> that<00:00:25.699> they<00:00:25.880> made<00:00:26.090> the<00:00:26.359> same<00:00:26.539> blanks

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
lighter that they made the same blanks

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.599 
lighter that they made the same blanks
that<00:00:26.960> I<00:00:27.080> was<00:00:27.230> used<00:00:27.410> to<00:00:27.470> using<00:00:27.650> but<00:00:28.369> they<00:00:28.460> just

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609 
that I was used to using but they just

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:29.980 
that I was used to using but they just
made<00:00:28.730> a<00:00:28.760> feel<00:00:29.090> lighter<00:00:29.359> and<00:00:29.480> have

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
made a feel lighter and have

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.080 
made a feel lighter and have
unbelievable<00:00:30.349> balance<00:00:30.859> so<00:00:31.310> now<00:00:31.820> that<00:00:31.880> I've

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
unbelievable balance so now that I've

actually gotten you know six months or
so<00:00:34.550> to<00:00:34.610> fish<00:00:34.880> with<00:00:35.090> these<00:00:35.239> rods<00:00:35.680> really<00:00:36.680> really

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
so to fish with these rods really really

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.910 
so to fish with these rods really really
impressed<00:00:38.000> with<00:00:38.210> them<00:00:38.329> the<00:00:38.840> the<00:00:39.350> spinning<00:00:39.739> rod

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
impressed with them the the spinning rod

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.910 
impressed with them the the spinning rod
is<00:00:40.190> something<00:00:40.940> that<00:00:41.120> I<00:00:41.360> was<00:00:41.629> very<00:00:42.020> surprised

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
is something that I was very surprised

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.889 
is something that I was very surprised
with<00:00:43.160> they've<00:00:43.579> got<00:00:43.760> this<00:00:43.940> the<00:00:44.210> first<00:00:44.480> guide<00:00:44.719> on

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
with they've got this the first guide on

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:47.350 
with they've got this the first guide on
it's<00:00:45.110> got<00:00:45.230> a<00:00:45.260> unique<00:00:45.649> and<00:00:45.860> Bend<00:00:46.070> so<00:00:46.879> that<00:00:47.120> the

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
it's got a unique and Bend so that the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.690 
it's got a unique and Bend so that the
line<00:00:47.960> does<00:00:48.260> not<00:00:48.410> get<00:00:48.649> wrapped<00:00:48.950> around<00:00:49.190> the

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
line does not get wrapped around the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.150 
line does not get wrapped around the
that<00:00:50.300> first<00:00:50.480> eyelet<00:00:50.989> I<00:00:51.140> fished<00:00:51.800> this<00:00:51.980> thing

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
that first eyelet I fished this thing

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.939 
that first eyelet I fished this thing
for<00:00:52.399> like<00:00:53.149> I<00:00:53.210> said<00:00:53.390> four<00:00:53.600> or<00:00:53.660> five<00:00:53.780> months<00:00:54.140> I've

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
for like I said four or five months I've

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.010 
for like I said four or five months I've
never<00:00:55.250> had<00:00:55.430> the<00:00:55.610> line<00:00:56.270> get<00:00:56.570> caught<00:00:56.750> on<00:00:56.870> that

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
never had the line get caught on that

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.840 
never had the line get caught on that
one<00:00:57.170> guide<00:00:57.379> there<00:00:57.649> and<00:00:57.829> as<00:00:58.219> you<00:00:58.340> can<00:00:58.430> see<00:00:58.489> the

with a big big spool on it the line
shoots<00:01:05.420> right<00:01:05.720> through<00:01:05.750> this<00:01:06.020> rod<00:01:06.290> very<00:01:07.130> very

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
shoots right through this rod very very

shoots right through this rod very very
impressed<00:01:08.270> with<00:01:08.450> it<00:01:08.600> and<00:01:08.780> with<00:01:09.049> those<00:01:09.260> extra

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
impressed with it and with those extra

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.770 
impressed with it and with those extra
guides<00:01:09.860> on<00:01:10.130> they're<00:01:10.340> very<00:01:11.000> very<00:01:11.270> sensitive

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
guides on they're very very sensitive

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.480 
guides on they're very very sensitive
rod<00:01:12.020> and<00:01:12.290> it's<00:01:12.409> and<00:01:12.619> it's<00:01:12.740> still<00:01:12.920> very<00:01:12.950> very

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
rod and it's and it's still very very

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.940 
rod and it's and it's still very very
light<00:01:13.790> so<00:01:14.420> when<00:01:15.200> you're<00:01:15.320> looking<00:01:15.680> at<00:01:15.830> the

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
light so when you're looking at the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.789 
light so when you're looking at the
traditional<00:01:16.729> micro<00:01:17.150> guide<00:01:17.360> rods<00:01:17.630> I<00:01:17.990> mean<00:01:18.680> you

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
traditional micro guide rods I mean you

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:20.289 
traditional micro guide rods I mean you
can<00:01:18.950> you<00:01:19.189> can<00:01:19.340> see<00:01:19.549> that<00:01:19.759> they're<00:01:19.939> they're

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
can you can see that they're they're

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.090 
can you can see that they're they're
really<00:01:20.600> really<00:01:20.750> small<00:01:20.840> and<00:01:21.409> as<00:01:21.799> I<00:01:21.920> said<00:01:21.979> before

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
really really small and as I said before

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.870 
really really small and as I said before
they<00:01:22.520> make<00:01:22.729> the<00:01:22.880> rod<00:01:23.060> a<00:01:23.360> lot<00:01:23.930> lighter<00:01:24.259> than

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
they make the rod a lot lighter than

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.980 
they make the rod a lot lighter than
then<00:01:25.880> the<00:01:25.909> traditional<00:01:26.540> rods<00:01:26.720> with<00:01:26.900> the

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
then the traditional rods with the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.109 
then the traditional rods with the
bigger<00:01:27.200> guides<00:01:27.530> it's<00:01:28.400> amazing<00:01:28.850> to<00:01:28.939> me<00:01:29.090> how

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
bigger guides it's amazing to me how

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.600 
bigger guides it's amazing to me how
they<00:01:29.930> have<00:01:30.140> more<00:01:30.380> guides<00:01:30.680> but<00:01:31.100> yet<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:31.430> rod

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
they have more guides but yet the rod

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.219 
they have more guides but yet the rod
overall<00:01:32.060> is<00:01:32.180> still<00:01:32.450> lighter<00:01:32.720> and<00:01:32.960> it<00:01:33.079> has<00:01:33.200> a

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
overall is still lighter and it has a

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.620 
overall is still lighter and it has a
better<00:01:33.409> balance<00:01:34.180> now<00:01:35.180> that<00:01:35.360> I've<00:01:35.450> actually

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
better balance now that I've actually

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.620 
better balance now that I've actually
had<00:01:35.930> time<00:01:36.110> to<00:01:36.140> fish<00:01:36.439> with<00:01:36.619> it<00:01:37.000> it<00:01:38.000> did<00:01:38.329> confirm

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
had time to fish with it it did confirm

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.630 
had time to fish with it it did confirm
my<00:01:39.079> theory<00:01:39.320> that<00:01:39.439> since<00:01:40.040> the<00:01:40.159> micro<00:01:40.460> guide

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
my theory that since the micro guide

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.850 
my theory that since the micro guide
rods<00:01:40.909> have<00:01:41.150> more<00:01:41.479> guides<00:01:41.810> on<00:01:42.140> them<00:01:42.320> there's

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
rods have more guides on them there's

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.230 
rods have more guides on them there's
more<00:01:43.100> places<00:01:43.520> for<00:01:43.549> that<00:01:43.850> for<00:01:44.210> that

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
more places for that for that

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.030
