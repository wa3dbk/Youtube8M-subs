00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
and how much all goes into a 911 3 liter

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.059 
and how much all goes into a 911 3 liter
6-cylinder<00:00:04.470> Porsche<00:00:05.450> got<00:00:06.450> out<00:00:06.600> now<00:00:06.919> I've<00:00:07.919> had

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
6-cylinder Porsche got out now I've had

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.249 
6-cylinder Porsche got out now I've had
a<00:00:08.099> quick<00:00:08.340> look<00:00:08.519> on<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.700> internet<00:00:10.309> but<00:00:11.309> um<00:00:12.259> you

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
a quick look on the internet but um you

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.930 
a quick look on the internet but um you
know<00:00:13.290> can't<00:00:13.679> seem<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:13.920> find<00:00:14.280> how<00:00:14.610> much<00:00:14.730> all

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
know can't seem to find how much all

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.230 
know can't seem to find how much all
goes<00:00:15.179> into<00:00:15.450> one<00:00:16.220> just<00:00:17.220> one<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:18.060> things

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
goes into one just one of the things

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.480 
goes into one just one of the things
yeah<00:00:18.750> it's<00:00:19.320> leaking<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.800> bit<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.039> all<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.279> think

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
yeah it's leaking a bit of all I think

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.730 
yeah it's leaking a bit of all I think
it's<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.689> it's<00:00:21.810> blind<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.170> bit<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.380> smoke

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
it's a and it's blind a bit of smoke

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.570 
it's a and it's blind a bit of smoke
when<00:00:23.519> you<00:00:23.609> first<00:00:24.060> started<00:00:24.510> up<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:24.930> think<00:00:24.990> the

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
when you first started up so I think the

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.070 
when you first started up so I think the
these<00:00:26.580> things<00:00:26.820> have<00:00:27.000> valve<00:00:27.269> stem<00:00:27.570> seals

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
these things have valve stem seals

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.890 
these things have valve stem seals
I<00:00:28.199> think<00:00:28.619> they<00:00:28.910> they're<00:00:29.910> other<00:00:30.119> if<00:00:30.599> there's

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
I think they they're other if there's

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.389 
I think they they're other if there's
either<00:00:31.140> leaking<00:00:31.619> past<00:00:31.859> those<00:00:32.130> they're

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
either leaking past those they're

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.490 
either leaking past those they're
probably<00:00:32.610> worn<00:00:33.079> doesn't<00:00:34.079> tend<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.260> blow<00:00:34.440> smoke

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
probably worn doesn't tend to blow smoke

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.319 
probably worn doesn't tend to blow smoke
once<00:00:34.950> it's<00:00:35.130> driving<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.670> once<00:00:35.790> she's<00:00:35.969> going

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
once it's driving and once she's going

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:44.479 
once it's driving and once she's going
say<00:00:36.920> let's<00:00:37.920> say<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.250> rings<00:00:38.760> are<00:00:38.940> okay<00:00:43.489> seems

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
say let's say the rings are okay seems

00:00:44.489 --> 00:01:12.429 
say let's say the rings are okay seems
as<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:45.379> yes<00:00:46.410> socks<00:00:46.920> not<00:00:47.160> quite<00:00:47.430> right<00:00:47.700> anyway

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.090 

handful<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.590> all<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:15.740> measure<00:01:16.740> how<00:01:16.950> much

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
handful of all so I measure how much

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.780 
handful of all so I measure how much
comes<00:01:17.430> out<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:18.140> check<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.259> out<00:01:19.460> anyway<00:01:20.460> up

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
comes out of that check it out anyway up

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.880 
comes out of that check it out anyway up
good<00:01:22.700> all<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:23.909> drained<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.590> pulled<00:01:25.590> off<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
good all that drained it pulled off the

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.469 
good all that drained it pulled off the
oil<00:01:25.920> filter<00:01:26.310> cleaned<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.150> cuz<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.420> couldn't

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
oil filter cleaned it cuz I couldn't

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.730 
oil filter cleaned it cuz I couldn't
find<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.049> on<00:01:28.400> it<00:01:29.400> anyway<00:01:29.790> with<00:01:30.000> them<00:01:30.740> trying

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
find it on it anyway with them trying

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.240 
find it on it anyway with them trying
the<00:01:31.890> oil<00:01:32.040> out<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.310> there<00:01:33.020> that<00:01:34.020> big<00:01:34.860> screw

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
the oil out of there that big screw

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.560 
the oil out of there that big screw
there<00:01:35.659> and<00:01:36.659> also<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.200> drained<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.920> out<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.189> this

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
there and also I drained it out of this

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.740 
there and also I drained it out of this
this<00:01:39.570> little<00:01:39.869> tank<00:01:40.650> up<00:01:40.829> here<00:01:41.450> so<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.509> have

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
this little tank up here so you have

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.620 
this little tank up here so you have
their<00:01:43.020> big<00:01:43.229> painful<00:01:43.920> there

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.749 

everything<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.439> it's<00:01:49.590> filling<00:01:49.860> up<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:50.250> fog

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
everything and it's filling up a fog

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.149 
everything and it's filling up a fog
later<00:01:51.030> bottle<00:01:51.799> and<00:01:52.850> a<00:01:53.850> two<00:01:54.030> liter<00:01:54.270> coke<00:01:54.479> bottle

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
later bottle and a two liter coke bottle

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:03.469 
later bottle and a two liter coke bottle
so<00:01:57.439> so<00:01:58.439> far<00:01:58.710> that's<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.580> seven<00:02:02.479> probably

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
so so far that's that seven probably

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.999 
so so far that's that seven probably
ain't<00:02:03.780> latest<00:02:04.140> because<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.380> have<00:02:04.680> filled<00:02:04.920> the

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
ain't latest because I have filled the

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.249 
ain't latest because I have filled the
five<00:02:05.220> liter<00:02:05.460> bottle<00:02:06.049> anyway

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.840 

well<00:02:10.259> let<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.470> know<00:02:10.619> see<00:02:11.400> how<00:02:11.459> much<00:02:11.580> smack

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
well let you know see how much smack

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.690 
well let you know see how much smack
applies<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.890> think<00:02:13.890> I'll<00:02:14.010> leave<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.370> camera<00:02:14.519> on

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
applies I think I'll leave the camera on

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.020 
applies I think I'll leave the camera on
I<00:02:15.170> just<00:02:16.170> point<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.620> towards<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:16.950> back<00:02:17.099> so<00:02:18.000> you

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
I just point it towards the back so you

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:37.809 
I just point it towards the back so you
can<00:02:18.239> see<00:02:26.540> well<00:02:27.540> just<00:02:27.720> roll<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:27.989> back<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.170> bit

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:03:53.930 

that<00:02:38.819> way<00:02:47.060> Smike<00:02:48.290> elsewhere

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:05:01.659 

start<00:03:54.570> up<00:03:54.840> start<00:03:55.020> up<00:03:55.320> again

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:06.979 

anyway<00:05:03.319> the<00:05:04.319> end<00:05:04.439> result<00:05:04.769> is<00:05:05.300> it<00:05:06.300> took<00:05:06.899> about

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:06.989 
anyway the end result is it took about

00:05:06.989 --> 00:05:10.249 
anyway the end result is it took about
ten<00:05:07.349> liters<00:05:07.679> of<00:05:07.769> all<00:05:08.689> it's<00:05:09.689> only<00:05:09.719> showing<00:05:10.080> up

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:10.259 
ten liters of all it's only showing up

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:12.969 
ten liters of all it's only showing up
to<00:05:10.379> the<00:05:10.499> minimum<00:05:11.039> just<00:05:11.969> bit<00:05:12.149> over<00:05:12.389> the<00:05:12.479> minimum

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
to the minimum just bit over the minimum

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.489 
to the minimum just bit over the minimum
on<00:05:13.979> the<00:05:14.039> lip<00:05:14.339> on<00:05:14.639> the<00:05:14.759> dipstick<00:05:15.199> now<00:05:16.199> that's

00:05:16.489 --> 00:05:16.499 
on the lip on the dipstick now that's

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:20.659 
on the lip on the dipstick now that's
what<00:05:16.679> the<00:05:16.800> engine<00:05:17.929> warmed<00:05:18.929> up<00:05:19.159> you<00:05:20.159> can't

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
what the engine warmed up you can't

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:22.489 
what the engine warmed up you can't
check<00:05:20.879> these<00:05:21.179> things<00:05:21.539> without<00:05:21.959> the<00:05:22.199> engine

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:22.499 
check these things without the engine

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:26.419 
check these things without the engine
being<00:05:22.649> warmed<00:05:23.039> up<00:05:23.300> so<00:05:24.300> yeah<00:05:24.749> that's<00:05:25.050> about<00:05:25.589> ten

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:26.429 
being warmed up so yeah that's about ten

00:05:26.429 --> 00:05:28.730 
being warmed up so yeah that's about ten
liters<00:05:26.819> probably<00:05:27.629> take<00:05:27.839> about<00:05:27.959> twelve<00:05:28.379> to<00:05:28.559> get

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
liters probably take about twelve to get

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.189 
liters probably take about twelve to get
to<00:05:28.889> the<00:05:29.009> max<00:05:29.249> but<00:05:30.179> I<00:05:30.360> don't<00:05:30.599> think<00:05:30.719> I'll<00:05:30.929> get<00:05:31.050> it

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 
to the max but I don't think I'll get it

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:33.350 
to the max but I don't think I'll get it
up<00:05:31.259> to<00:05:31.409> the<00:05:31.499> max<00:05:31.729> you<00:05:32.729> know<00:05:32.819> I'll<00:05:32.909> just<00:05:33.119> see<00:05:33.300> if

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
up to the max you know I'll just see if

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.209 
up to the max you know I'll just see if
with<00:05:33.599> this<00:05:34.110> thicker<00:05:34.349> all<00:05:34.589> if<00:05:34.830> it's<00:05:34.979> going<00:05:35.159> to

00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:35.219 
with this thicker all if it's going to

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:39.559 
with this thicker all if it's going to
stop<00:05:36.979> stop<00:05:37.979> line<00:05:38.189> with<00:05:38.369> a<00:05:38.399> smoke<00:05:38.699> through<00:05:39.509> the

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:39.569 
stop stop line with a smoke through the

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:41.389 
stop stop line with a smoke through the
bell<00:05:39.719> stands<00:05:40.050> I<00:05:40.319> suppose<00:05:40.589> that's<00:05:41.039> where<00:05:41.219> the

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:41.399 
bell stands I suppose that's where the

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:43.850 
bell stands I suppose that's where the
oils<00:05:41.759> getting<00:05:42.089> that's<00:05:42.990> blank<00:05:43.289> smoke<00:05:43.559> out<00:05:43.740> the

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
oils getting that's blank smoke out the

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.230 
oils getting that's blank smoke out the
exhaust<00:05:44.099> so<00:05:45.559> we'll<00:05:46.559> see<00:05:46.740> if<00:05:46.830> it<00:05:46.919> stops<00:05:47.240> leaking

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
exhaust so we'll see if it stops leaking

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.399 
exhaust so we'll see if it stops leaking
past<00:05:48.689> the<00:05:48.869> valve<00:05:49.050> stem<00:05:49.319> seals<00:05:50.990> yeah<00:05:51.990> guys<00:05:52.199> I'll

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:52.409 
past the valve stem seals yeah guys I'll

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:54.290 
past the valve stem seals yeah guys I'll
take<00:05:52.589> it<00:05:52.679> for<00:05:52.800> a<00:05:52.829> spin<00:05:52.860> and<00:05:53.129> lay<00:05:53.759> the<00:05:53.819> crap<00:05:54.119> out

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
take it for a spin and lay the crap out

00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:02.280 
take it for a spin and lay the crap out
of<00:05:54.329> it

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:02.290 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.360 

it's<00:06:02.440> not<00:06:02.590> helping<00:06:02.980> anymore<00:06:03.250> it's<00:06:03.730> getting<00:06:04.090> it

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
it's not helping anymore it's getting it

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:10.730 
it's not helping anymore it's getting it
any<00:06:05.490> more<00:06:05.699> roof

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740
