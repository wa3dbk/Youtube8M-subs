00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
actually been wanting it ever since it

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.359 
actually been wanting it ever since it
came<00:01:11.729> out<00:01:11.909> earlier<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:12.720> year<00:01:13.010> but<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.040> just

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
came out earlier this year but I just

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.920 
came out earlier this year but I just
never<00:01:14.729> really<00:01:15.180> got<00:01:15.210> around<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:16.110> buying<00:01:16.880> it<00:01:17.930> but

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
never really got around to buying it but

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.660 
never really got around to buying it but
after<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.380> watched<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.830> movie<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.340> finally

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
after I watched the movie that finally

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.660 
after I watched the movie that finally
kind<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.970> solidified<00:01:21.960> my<00:01:22.170> decision<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.920> go

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
kind of solidified my decision to go

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.910 
kind of solidified my decision to go
ahead<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.030> pick<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:24.330> kit<00:01:24.600> up<00:01:26.720> and<00:01:27.799> as<00:01:28.799> you

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
ahead and pick this kit up and as you

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.380 
ahead and pick this kit up and as you
can<00:01:29.040> see<00:01:29.100> we've<00:01:29.430> got<00:01:29.460> some<00:01:29.640> really<00:01:30.240> nice

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
can see we've got some really nice

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.670 
can see we've got some really nice
fluorescent<00:01:31.229> colored<00:01:31.740> ports<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.310> here<00:01:33.680> as

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
fluorescent colored ports in here as

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.580 
fluorescent colored ports in here as
well<00:01:35.009> as<00:01:35.250> some<00:01:35.460> really<00:01:35.490> nice<00:01:35.939> clear<00:01:36.900> sparkly

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
well as some really nice clear sparkly

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.149 
well as some really nice clear sparkly
parts<00:01:38.150> so<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.450> think<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.950> going<00:01:41.100> to

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
parts so I think that this is going to

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.500 
parts so I think that this is going to
be<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.280> really<00:01:41.610> unique<00:01:42.470> experience

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.490 

so<00:01:47.510> yeah<00:01:47.750> I<00:01:49.810> can't<00:01:50.810> really<00:01:50.900> think<00:01:51.080> of<00:01:51.290> anything

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
so yeah I can't really think of anything

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.410 
so yeah I can't really think of anything
else<00:01:51.770> I<00:01:52.070> was<00:01:52.280> gonna<00:01:52.370> say<00:01:52.640> about<00:01:52.850> let's<00:01:53.060> go<00:01:53.180> so

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
else I was gonna say about let's go so

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.980 
else I was gonna say about let's go so
I'll<00:01:53.630> put<00:01:53.810> him<00:01:53.990> to<00:01:54.110> the<00:01:54.140> side<00:01:56.770> also<00:01:57.770> I<00:01:58.250> got<00:01:58.520> a

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
I'll put him to the side also I got a

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.190 
I'll put him to the side also I got a
second<00:01:59.990> pack<00:02:00.200> of<00:02:00.940> Gundam<00:02:01.940> real<00:02:02.300> touch<00:02:02.600> markers

really<00:02:31.400> all<00:02:32.060> that<00:02:32.240> great<00:02:32.420> for<00:02:32.840> that<00:02:33.020> but<00:02:33.620> they

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
really all that great for that but they

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.910 
really all that great for that but they
are<00:02:33.890> amazing<00:02:34.820> for<00:02:35.240> doing<00:02:36.110> panel<00:02:36.500> lines<00:02:38.920> just

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
are amazing for doing panel lines just

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.850 
are amazing for doing panel lines just
because<00:02:40.280> their<00:02:40.730> ink<00:02:41.630> their<00:02:42.230> our<00:02:42.320> brush<00:02:42.590> tip

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
because their ink their our brush tip

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.670 
because their ink their our brush tip
ink<00:02:43.160> pins<00:02:43.510> so<00:02:44.510> you<00:02:44.600> can<00:02:44.780> really<00:02:44.959> get<00:02:45.200> down<00:02:45.260> into

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
ink pins so you can really get down into

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.180 
ink pins so you can really get down into
the<00:02:45.830> panel<00:02:46.160> lines<00:02:46.280> pretty<00:02:46.610> easily<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:48.190> they

stock<00:04:31.940> but<00:04:34.130> they<00:04:35.130> I<00:04:35.460> think<00:04:35.669> probably<00:04:36.270> about<00:04:36.389> a

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
stock but they I think probably about a

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:38.659 
stock but they I think probably about a
day<00:04:36.690> later<00:04:36.990> they<00:04:37.590> emailed<00:04:38.010> me<00:04:38.190> back<00:04:38.340> and<00:04:38.400> said

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
day later they emailed me back and said

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:40.850 
day later they emailed me back and said
it<00:04:38.940> wasn't<00:04:39.539> actually<00:04:39.750> in<00:04:40.169> stock<00:04:40.500> and<00:04:40.830> that

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
it wasn't actually in stock and that

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.189 
it wasn't actually in stock and that
they<00:04:41.639> had<00:04:41.820> to<00:04:42.000> get<00:04:42.150> it<00:04:42.300> from<00:04:42.660> sage<00:04:43.350> their<00:04:43.949> resin

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 
they had to get it from sage their resin

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:49.520 
they had to get it from sage their resin
recast<00:04:46.490> distributor<00:04:47.490> so<00:04:48.449> it<00:04:48.840> would<00:04:48.990> take<00:04:49.229> a

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
recast distributor so it would take a

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.990 
recast distributor so it would take a
certain<00:04:50.130> amount<00:04:50.280> of<00:04:50.550> time<00:04:50.729> to<00:04:50.880> get<00:04:51.000> here<00:04:51.360> and

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
certain amount of time to get here and

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.939 
certain amount of time to get here and
it<00:04:54.000> still<00:04:54.240> hasn't<00:04:54.660> gotten<00:04:54.780> here<00:04:55.080> I<00:04:55.320> haven't

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
it still hasn't gotten here I haven't

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:57.370 
it still hasn't gotten here I haven't
heard<00:04:56.190> from<00:04:56.220> them<00:04:56.520> since

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
heard from them since

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:04.040 
heard from them since
so<00:04:59.810> now<00:05:00.810> I've<00:05:01.169> got<00:05:01.470> a<00:05:02.270> crossbow<00:05:03.270> I'm<00:05:03.539> gonna<00:05:03.720> but

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
so now I've got a crossbow I'm gonna but

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.689 
so now I've got a crossbow I'm gonna but
I've<00:05:04.169> got<00:05:04.380> no<00:05:04.590> shot<00:05:05.070> Lance

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699 
I've got no shot Lance

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:09.740 
I've got no shot Lance
so<00:05:06.510> I<00:05:06.930> mean<00:05:07.970> technically<00:05:08.970> I<00:05:09.060> could<00:05:09.360> go<00:05:09.510> ahead

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
so I mean technically I could go ahead

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.580 
so I mean technically I could go ahead
and<00:05:09.870> repaint<00:05:10.320> this<00:05:11.250> guy<00:05:11.460> but<00:05:12.080> the<00:05:13.080> shot<00:05:13.320> Lance

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
and repaint this guy but the shot Lance

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.060 
and repaint this guy but the shot Lance
is<00:05:13.800> really<00:05:14.130> what<00:05:14.310> distinguishes<00:05:15.410> X<00:05:16.410> 1<00:05:16.710> from<00:05:16.889> X

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
is really what distinguishes X 1 from X

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.340 
is really what distinguishes X 1 from X
2

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.430 

and<00:05:21.350> I<00:05:21.740> like<00:05:22.040> the<00:05:22.220> clear<00:05:22.610> parts<00:05:22.970> for<00:05:23.240> the

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
and I like the clear parts for the

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.720 
and I like the clear parts for the
crossbone<00:05:24.440> Gundam<00:05:24.740> because<00:05:24.980> you<00:05:25.100> really<00:05:25.580> get

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:25.730 
crossbone Gundam because you really get

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.840 
crossbone Gundam because you really get
a<00:05:25.760> lot<00:05:26.120> of<00:05:26.330> them<00:05:26.510> I<00:05:26.600> mean<00:05:27.530> basically<00:05:28.070> both<00:05:28.310> arms

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
a lot of them I mean basically both arms

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.540 
a lot of them I mean basically both arms
both<00:05:29.150> legs<00:05:29.210> and<00:05:29.930> all<00:05:30.140> four<00:05:30.440> of<00:05:30.710> the<00:05:31.010> cross<00:05:31.250> bone

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
both legs and all four of the cross bone

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.480 
both legs and all four of the cross bone
thrusters<00:05:32.150> are<00:05:33.580> going<00:05:34.580> to<00:05:34.640> be<00:05:34.730> clear<00:05:35.060> so<00:05:35.450> you

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
thrusters are going to be clear so you

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.920 
thrusters are going to be clear so you
get<00:05:37.490> lots<00:05:37.700> of<00:05:37.850> clear<00:05:38.090> parts<00:05:38.420> with<00:05:38.570> this<00:05:38.750> guy

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
get lots of clear parts with this guy

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.100 
get lots of clear parts with this guy
and<00:05:40.120> the<00:05:41.120> reason<00:05:41.390> I<00:05:41.450> got<00:05:41.570> the<00:05:41.690> full<00:05:41.900> cloth

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
and the reason I got the full cloth

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.560 
and the reason I got the full cloth
version<00:05:42.650> is<00:05:42.920> just<00:05:43.640> simply<00:05:43.910> because<00:05:44.270> I<00:05:44.390> already

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
version is just simply because I already

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.530 
version is just simply because I already
have<00:05:44.810> a<00:05:44.840> cross<00:05:45.110> bone<00:05:45.380> gonna<00:05:45.590> Birkhoff<00:05:46.510> so<00:05:47.510> I

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:47.540 
have a cross bone gonna Birkhoff so I

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.220 
have a cross bone gonna Birkhoff so I
figured<00:05:48.140> if<00:05:48.680> I<00:05:49.070> get<00:05:49.310> a<00:05:49.550> full<00:05:49.940> cloth<00:05:50.210> I<00:05:50.570> can<00:05:50.780> do<00:05:51.200> a

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.230 
figured if I get a full cloth I can do a

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:56.970 
figured if I get a full cloth I can do a
review<00:05:51.650> on<00:05:51.830> it<00:05:51.860> and<00:05:55.300> I'm<00:05:56.300> planning<00:05:56.570> on

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:56.980 
review on it and I'm planning on

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:02.770 
review on it and I'm planning on
painting<00:05:57.980> the<00:05:58.340> full<00:05:58.700> cloth<00:06:00.280> weapon<00:06:01.280> stuff<00:06:02.030> up

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 
painting the full cloth weapon stuff up

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.110 
painting the full cloth weapon stuff up
and<00:06:03.110> the<00:06:03.230> x2<00:06:03.530> color<00:06:03.890> scheme<00:06:04.250> because<00:06:04.610> I've

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
and the x2 color scheme because I've

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.380 
and the x2 color scheme because I've
seen<00:06:05.650> x2<00:06:06.650> full<00:06:07.010> cloth<00:06:07.280> versions<00:06:07.820> done<00:06:08.060> before

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:08.390 
seen x2 full cloth versions done before

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.870 
seen x2 full cloth versions done before
but<00:06:08.660> you<00:06:08.870> don't<00:06:09.020> see<00:06:09.230> them<00:06:09.320> that<00:06:09.350> often<00:06:09.850> so<00:06:10.850> I

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
but you don't see them that often so I

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.180 
but you don't see them that often so I
figured<00:06:11.180> I'd<00:06:11.300> just<00:06:11.480> do<00:06:11.900> one<00:06:12.110> just<00:06:12.320> to<00:06:12.530> mix

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
figured I'd just do one just to mix

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.450 
figured I'd just do one just to mix
things<00:06:13.310> up<00:06:13.610> a<00:06:13.790> bit

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460 
things up a bit

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.030 
things up a bit
anyway<00:06:16.460> I<00:06:16.840> guess<00:06:17.840> that's<00:06:18.020> about<00:06:18.230> it<00:06:18.440> for<00:06:18.710> this

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.040 
anyway I guess that's about it for this

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:24.660 
anyway I guess that's about it for this
I<00:06:19.310> got<00:06:19.670> a<00:06:19.700> package<00:06:19.970> today

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:24.670 

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.850

although I guess I'll show you guys a

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.700 
although I guess I'll show you guys a
little<00:06:28.070> bit<00:06:28.220> of<00:06:28.340> progress<00:06:28.550> on<00:06:28.880> my<00:06:28.970> gonna<00:06:29.180> max<00:06:29.710> I

little bit of progress on my gonna max I

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.100 
little bit of progress on my gonna max I
got<00:06:31.520> quite<00:06:31.910> a<00:06:31.970> bit<00:06:32.150> of<00:06:32.240> painting<00:06:32.480> done<00:06:32.780> on<00:06:32.960> him

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.110

yesterday so as you can see pretty much

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:41.320 
yesterday so as you can see pretty much
the<00:06:36.800> entire<00:06:37.490> upper<00:06:37.910> body<00:06:37.940> is<00:06:38.390> done<00:06:38.980> and<00:06:40.330> I

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.330 
the entire upper body is done and I

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:42.940 
the entire upper body is done and I
changed<00:06:41.870> up<00:06:41.960> the<00:06:42.110> colors<00:06:42.380> a<00:06:42.470> little<00:06:42.620> bit<00:06:42.770> on

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:42.950 
changed up the colors a little bit on

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:47.590 
changed up the colors a little bit on
the<00:06:43.040> torso<00:06:43.600> as<00:06:44.600> you<00:06:44.660> can<00:06:44.930> see<00:06:45.580> the<00:06:46.580> torsos<00:06:47.000> oops

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:47.600 
the torso as you can see the torsos oops

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.390 
the torso as you can see the torsos oops
there<00:06:47.960> with<00:06:48.080> the<00:06:48.200> arm<00:06:48.350> the<00:06:49.010> torso<00:06:49.370> was

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:49.400 
there with the arm the torso was

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.280 
there with the arm the torso was
normally<00:06:50.270> just<00:06:50.480> red<00:06:50.780> and<00:06:50.810> blue<00:06:51.610> but<00:06:52.610> I<00:06:53.290> put

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:54.290 
normally just red and blue but I put

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:55.810 
normally just red and blue but I put
some<00:06:54.470> white<00:06:54.680> down<00:06:54.920> here<00:06:55.160> and<00:06:55.280> wrap<00:06:55.490> the<00:06:55.670> red

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:55.820 
some white down here and wrap the red

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.550 
some white down here and wrap the red
all<00:06:56.000> the<00:06:56.120> way<00:06:56.240> around<00:06:56.480> the<00:06:56.600> back<00:06:56.720> just<00:06:57.080> to<00:06:57.230> make

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560 
all the way around the back just to make

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.900 
all the way around the back just to make
it<00:06:58.310> seem<00:06:58.640> a<00:06:59.050> little<00:07:00.050> bit<00:07:00.350> more<00:07:00.910> consistent

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:01.910 
it seem a little bit more consistent

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:08.050 
it seem a little bit more consistent
with<00:07:02.060> other<00:07:02.330> lead<00:07:02.600> Gundams<00:07:05.260> anyway<00:07:06.260> I<00:07:07.060> guess

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:08.060 
with other lead Gundams anyway I guess

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.080 
with other lead Gundams anyway I guess
I'm<00:07:08.240> just<00:07:08.420> rambling<00:07:08.870> on<00:07:08.990> at<00:07:09.170> this<00:07:09.260> point<00:07:09.820> so<00:07:10.820> I

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:11.090 
I'm just rambling on at this point so I

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:15.160 
I'm just rambling on at this point so I
guess<00:07:11.330> that<00:07:11.540> about<00:07:11.630> does<00:07:11.780> it<00:07:12.050> for<00:07:12.700> this<00:07:14.080> video

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:15.170 
guess that about does it for this video

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.280 
guess that about does it for this video
and<00:07:16.210> for<00:07:17.210> those<00:07:17.360> of<00:07:17.540> you<00:07:17.630> who<00:07:17.810> haven't<00:07:18.050> been

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:18.290 
and for those of you who haven't been

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:23.530 
and for those of you who haven't been
paying<00:07:18.950> attention<00:07:19.130> to<00:07:19.460> the<00:07:19.700> Gundam<00:07:22.090> news<00:07:23.090> I

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:23.540 
paying attention to the Gundam news I

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.210 
paying attention to the Gundam news I
guess<00:07:23.750> this<00:07:24.080> been<00:07:24.260> coming<00:07:24.560> out<00:07:24.650> of<00:07:24.710> the<00:07:24.830> Tokyo

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:25.220 
guess this been coming out of the Tokyo

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.270 
guess this been coming out of the Tokyo
