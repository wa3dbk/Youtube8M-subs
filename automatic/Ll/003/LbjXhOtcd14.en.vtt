can<00:00:38.129> improve<00:00:38.160> search<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.820> destroy<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.690> I

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
can improve search and destroy so I

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.920 
can improve search and destroy so I
prepared<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.770> notepad<00:00:41.340> document<00:00:41.790> I'm<00:00:42.719> one

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
prepared motherfucker over here come and

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.459 
prepared motherfucker over here come and
notepad<00:00:45.270> out<00:00:45.390> like<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.629> true<00:00:45.809> professional<00:00:45.930> and

notepad out like a true professional and
I<00:00:46.890> wrote<00:00:47.100> down<00:00:47.129> some<00:00:47.460> stuff<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.850> believe

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
I wrote down some stuff that I believe

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.090 
I wrote down some stuff that I believe
they've<00:00:48.329> done<00:00:48.510> right<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:49.469> I've<00:00:49.559> judged<00:00:49.829> from

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
they've done right that I've judged from

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.619 
they've done right that I've judged from
watching<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.730> game<00:00:50.910> plays<00:00:51.120> they've<00:00:51.420> uploaded

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
watching the game plays they've uploaded

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.990 
watching the game plays they've uploaded
and<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.199> streams<00:00:52.469> they<00:00:52.680> did<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.070> some<00:00:53.789> other

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
and the streams they did and some other

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.340 
and the streams they did and some other
things<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.420> believe<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:54.960> should<00:00:55.140> do

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
things that I believe that I should do

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.799 
things that I believe that I should do
to<00:00:55.559> improve<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.190> make<00:00:56.730> search<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.690> destroy

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
to improve and make search and destroy

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.240 
to improve and make search and destroy
more<00:00:58.199> fast<00:00:58.440> paced<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.890> think<00:00:59.070> that's<00:00:59.190> the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
more fast paced I think that's the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.560 
more fast paced I think that's the
underlying<00:00:59.640> thing<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.090> they<00:01:00.180> have<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.420> aim

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
underlying thing that they have to aim

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.330 
underlying thing that they have to aim
for<00:01:00.600> make<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.469> more<00:01:01.590> balanced<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.100> more

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
for make it more balanced and more

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.310 
for make it more balanced and more
fast-paced<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.690> first<00:01:03.809> thing<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.199> was

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
fast-paced so the first thing that I was

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.380 
fast-paced so the first thing that I was
happy<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.710> see<00:01:04.860> return<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.580> lightweight<00:01:06.090> and

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
happy to see return is lightweight and

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.240 
happy to see return is lightweight and
now<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:06.900> game<00:01:06.990> play<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.770> told<00:01:07.920> me<00:01:07.979> you

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
now in this game play you told me you

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.670 
now in this game play you told me you
see<00:01:08.430> me<00:01:08.460> rush<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.390> middle<00:01:09.659> part<00:01:09.869> i<00:01:10.080> gave<00:01:10.439> the

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
see me rush the middle part i gave the

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.890 
see me rush the middle part i gave the
of<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.280> map<00:01:11.460> every<00:01:12.060> single<00:01:12.360> round<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.810> it

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
of the map every single round and it

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.210 
of the map every single round and it
gives<00:01:13.080> me<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.229> couple<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.530> kills<00:01:13.740> each<00:01:13.950> time

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
gives me a couple of kills each time

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.890 
gives me a couple of kills each time
which<00:01:14.760> helps<00:01:15.000> my<00:01:15.119> teammate<00:01:15.450> with<00:01:15.689> lightweight

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
which helps my teammate with lightweight

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.080 
which helps my teammate with lightweight
this<00:01:16.229> would<00:01:16.350> make<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:16.920> much<00:01:17.369> easier<00:01:17.640> just<00:01:17.939> a

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
this would make it so much easier just a

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.219 
this would make it so much easier just a
rough<00:01:18.210> day<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.659> get<00:01:18.750> there<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.960> little<00:01:19.110> bit

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
rough day to get there a little bit

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.990 
rough day to get there a little bit
quicker<00:01:19.500> than<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.770> opponents<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.369> hopefully

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
quicker than the opponents and hopefully

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.120 
quicker than the opponents and hopefully

to run out earlier and it would just

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.420 
to run out earlier and it would just
make<00:02:32.050> it<00:02:32.110> for<00:02:32.470> a<00:02:32.500> better<00:02:32.650> experience<00:02:32.890> in<00:02:33.310> my

if<00:02:46.180> that<00:02:46.360> makes<00:02:46.510> any<00:02:46.600> sense<00:02:46.720> so<00:02:47.020> the<00:02:47.110> first

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
if that makes any sense so the first

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.900 
if that makes any sense so the first
planted<00:02:47.680> be<00:02:47.770> a<00:02:47.800> thousand<00:02:48.190> points<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.550> second

planted be a thousand points the second

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.970 
planted be a thousand points the second
one<00:02:49.000> might<00:02:49.150> be<00:02:49.270> 1500<00:02:50.050> and<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.620> third<00:02:50.800> one

of people play Search and Destroy just a
rank<00:02:55.360> up<00:02:55.540> so<00:02:56.200> that<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.680> extra<00:02:57.580> XP<00:02:57.850> incentive

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
rank up so that the extra XP incentive

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.310 
rank up so that the extra XP incentive
would<00:02:59.230> hopefully<00:02:59.530> introduce<00:03:00.220> more<00:03:01.320> incentive

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
would hopefully introduce more incentive

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.630 
would hopefully introduce more incentive
I'll<00:03:02.440> use<00:03:02.590> that<00:03:02.620> word<00:03:02.890> again<00:03:03.160> just<00:03:03.430> to<00:03:03.490> play

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
I'll use that word again just to play

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.670 
I'll use that word again just to play
the<00:03:03.790> objective<00:03:04.180> multiple<00:03:04.630> times<00:03:04.900> hopefully

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
the objective multiple times hopefully

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.410 
the objective multiple times hopefully
that<00:03:05.830> will<00:03:05.920> make<00:03:06.130> people<00:03:06.370> run<00:03:06.910> the<00:03:07.030> objective

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
that will make people run the objective

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.450 
that will make people run the objective
more<00:03:07.660> and<00:03:07.840> make<00:03:08.680> for<00:03:08.830> a<00:03:08.860> faster<00:03:09.160> paced<00:03:09.370> game

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
more and make for a faster paced game

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.730 
more and make for a faster paced game
not<00:03:09.940> sure<00:03:10.120> if<00:03:10.180> that<00:03:10.240> will<00:03:10.450> happen<00:03:10.900> and<00:03:11.290> the

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
not sure if that will happen and the

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
last thing that I thought of as i get

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.000 
last thing that I thought of as i get
the<00:03:13.300> round<00:03:13.510> winning<00:03:14.020> killcam<00:03:14.260> on<00:03:14.620> this<00:03:14.740> right

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
the round winning killcam on this right

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
of the rotation or at least put them in

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.080 
of the rotation or at least put them in
half<00:03:23.230> like<00:03:23.470> they<00:03:23.620> did<00:03:23.770> on<00:03:23.860> SI<00:03:24.160> lo<00:03:24.370> not<00:03:24.880> sure<00:03:25.030> if

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
half like they did on SI lo not sure if

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.640 
half like they did on SI lo not sure if
only<00:03:25.270> you<00:03:25.330> guys<00:03:25.480> played<00:03:25.720> Search<00:03:26.440> and<00:03:26.620> Destroy

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
only you guys played Search and Destroy

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.070 
only you guys played Search and Destroy
on<00:03:27.070> SI<00:03:27.310> lo<00:03:27.490> on<00:03:27.670> call<00:03:27.940> of<00:03:27.970> duty<00:03:28.270> 5<00:03:28.420> but<00:03:28.990> they

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
on SI lo on call of duty 5 but they

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.360 
on SI lo on call of duty 5 but they
pretty<00:03:29.260> much<00:03:29.320> put<00:03:29.620> them<00:03:29.740> up<00:03:29.860> in<00:03:29.890> half<00:03:30.130> which

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
pretty much put them up in half which

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.680 
pretty much put them up in half which
was<00:03:30.490> a<00:03:30.520> very<00:03:30.760> good<00:03:30.910> idea<00:03:31.030> because<00:03:31.300> it<00:03:31.450> was<00:03:31.540> way

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
was a very good idea because it was way

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.660 
was a very good idea because it was way
too<00:03:31.720> big<00:03:32.050> for<00:03:32.080> search<00:03:32.410> so<00:03:32.709> very<00:03:33.340> short<00:03:33.550> game

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
too big for search so very short game

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.220 
too big for search so very short game
plan<00:03:33.880> thought<00:03:34.330> I'd<00:03:34.390> talk<00:03:34.480> about<00:03:34.690> black<00:03:34.900> ops<00:03:35.020> 2
