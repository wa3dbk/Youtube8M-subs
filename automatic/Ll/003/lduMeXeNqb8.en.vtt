00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:10.310
 here is a small guide to learn how to 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:12.110
 change the bike pedals in this one 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:15.189
 case we're talking about a mountain 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.570
 bike but also applies to racing bikes 

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:21.980
 basically the whole thing is a lot 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:25.900
 simple because with a 15 key 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:30.909
 like this one goes to find what 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.899
 the faux bollonet congo is not a bolt 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:36.699
 full 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:41.600
 doing a little pressure you go to 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:45.079
 turn clockwise 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:49.129
 in this case it is going to the other not 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:53.350
 oh well it gets screwed so let's go to al 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:01:00.550
 sorry otherwise we go to unscrew 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:00.550
 then our hospital 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:11.060
 here it creates a bit of difficulty because 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:13.119
 understood that it is going to be sent to 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.119
 board 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.649
 ok we got screwed up 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.530
 on the other side and I have lent myself already 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:29.960
 come on then we will not see how to disassemble 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:33.500
 also the left pedal going to 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:39.579
 pick up our new pedals that 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:45.890
 surely they are not of the highest quality 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:47.920
 are bit pedals bought from 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.920
 decathlon 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.390
 let's say they are the 3 base platforms 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:55.899
 reviews i saw that many yes 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.429
 complain of the reflectors peta 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:02.030
 that are on one side attached with 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:05.659
 these bolts and the other side are 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.390
 instead using plastic hooks 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.819
 so I don't know maybe then watch out for 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.959
 plus this look and try to 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:17.360
 preserve them for as long as possible 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:22.310
 and also with regards to speed 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:25.880
 with which they run we also say they are not i 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.970
 stop here I'm changing them only 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:33.890
 because with the plastic pedals that like 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:38.420
 you can see these read at pilli non 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:40.819
 offers necessary grip and I found myself 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.880
 on several occasions going into 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:49.140
 forest where the foot slips 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:52.130
 and loses its grip then misses the foot 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:56.610
 slippery lapse risk of falling 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:03:00.300
 let's now proceed to change how 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:03.690
 previously said in this case i 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:10.620
 pedals carry the wording r 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:13.470
 for this the l for the other pedal r 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.640
 of the English left right 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:22.950
 nothing easier now we go to 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:26.280
 inhabit the pedal as they should 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.140
 be universal, therefore 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.480
 they should come in without it big 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.770
 difficulty has already entered with ours 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.550
 key from 15 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:42.890
 we will then start a 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:43.940
 screw it in this way so simple 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:49.760
 it's fast 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:52.040
 we have replaced our pedals now 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.050
 will complete the work I think 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.680
 there is no need to continue to 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.480
 to resume 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:03.590
 what to say I wish you enjoy yourself there 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:06.200
 I hope this video is very short but 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:09.110
 which describes a lot of operation 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.880
 as simple as for the most novice can 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.400
 also be complicated because yes 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.870
 they will ask how not to see 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.400
 maybe some screws that come out then 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.490
 beautiful view 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.930
 I hope that it may have been useful 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:29.410
