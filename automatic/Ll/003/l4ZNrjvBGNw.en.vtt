really strong
I<00:01:44.220> say<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.340> biggest<00:01:45.549> thing<00:01:45.880> is<00:01:46.000> we<00:01:46.180> have

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
I say the biggest thing is we have

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.690 
I say the biggest thing is we have
expanded<00:01:47.229> our<00:01:47.320> AI<00:01:47.650> family<00:01:48.189> by<00:01:48.310> quite<00:01:48.610> a<00:01:48.640> bit

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
expanded our AI family by quite a bit

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.789 
expanded our AI family by quite a bit
there's<00:01:49.330> lots<00:01:49.930> of<00:01:50.049> different<00:01:50.110> creature<00:01:50.560> types

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
there's lots of different creature types

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.499 
there's lots of different creature types
and<00:01:51.159> there's<00:01:51.580> lots<00:01:51.670> of<00:01:51.820> new<00:01:51.880> ways<00:01:52.149> that<00:01:52.420> they

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
and there's lots of new ways that they

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.090 
and there's lots of new ways that they
do<00:01:52.659> the<00:01:52.990> creature<00:01:53.380> types<00:01:53.590> interact<00:01:53.920> with<00:01:54.040> each

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
do the creature types interact with each

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.280 
do the creature types interact with each
other<00:01:54.270> for<00:01:55.270> example<00:01:55.630> there's<00:01:55.840> a<00:01:55.930> new<00:01:56.140> guy

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
other for example there's a new guy

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.990 
other for example there's a new guy
called<00:01:56.619> the<00:01:56.710> Kansas<00:01:57.130> and<00:01:57.340> have<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:57.909> ability

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
called the Kansas and have the ability

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.740 
called the Kansas and have the ability
to<00:01:58.470> revive<00:01:59.470> down<00:02:00.240> teammates<00:02:01.240> on<00:02:01.360> their<00:02:01.539> side

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
to revive down teammates on their side

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.690 
to revive down teammates on their side
so<00:02:02.020> if<00:02:02.170> you<00:02:02.649> shoot<00:02:02.830> down<00:02:02.979> a<00:02:03.009> locust<00:02:03.399> but<00:02:03.549> don't

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
so if you shoot down a locust but don't

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.830 
so if you shoot down a locust but don't
finish<00:02:03.880> him<00:02:04.060> he<00:02:04.180> can<00:02:04.330> bring<00:02:04.450> him<00:02:04.509> back<00:02:04.690> to<00:02:04.810> life

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
finish him he can bring him back to life

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.389 
finish him he can bring him back to life

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
of the mechanics of it we came up with

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.979 
of the mechanics of it we came up with
this<00:03:34.489> idea<00:03:34.640> to<00:03:35.060> kind<00:03:35.209> of<00:03:35.330> have<00:03:35.480> it<00:03:35.630> where<00:03:35.810> he's

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
this idea to kind of have it where he's

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.080 
this idea to kind of have it where he's
walking<00:03:36.200> on<00:03:36.500> his<00:03:36.590> arms<00:03:37.010> and<00:03:37.340> his<00:03:37.459> body<00:03:37.730> kind<00:03:38.030> of

are on I think the one word that we do

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.570 
are on I think the one word that we do
use<00:04:25.000> most<00:04:25.390> often<00:04:25.660> and<00:04:26.020> probably<00:04:26.860> daily<00:04:27.280> is
