00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.950 

the<00:00:18.890> house<00:00:19.099> was<00:00:19.789> designed<00:00:20.179> around<00:00:20.689> the

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
the house was designed around the

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.259 
the house was designed around the
original<00:00:21.560> organ<00:00:21.800> we<00:00:21.919> started<00:00:22.339> with<00:00:22.519> the

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.269 
original organ we started with the

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.569 
original organ we started with the
original<00:00:23.800> placement<00:00:24.800> of<00:00:24.859> the<00:00:24.949> organ<00:00:25.279> in<00:00:25.429> the

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:25.579 
original placement of the organ in the

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:27.400 
original placement of the organ in the
in<00:00:25.849> the<00:00:25.880> mezzanine<00:00:26.210> area<00:00:26.480> and<00:00:26.989> that<00:00:27.109> floor<00:00:27.380> was

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
in the mezzanine area and that floor was

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.220 
in the mezzanine area and that floor was
the<00:00:27.679> first<00:00:27.919> floor<00:00:28.130> we<00:00:28.279> designed<00:00:28.669> and<00:00:29.230> this

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
the first floor we designed and this

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.929 
the first floor we designed and this
room<00:00:30.439> was<00:00:30.500> built<00:00:30.949> around<00:00:31.219> that<00:00:31.550> and<00:00:31.789> then

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
room was built around that and then

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:33.490 
room was built around that and then
saral<00:00:32.269> decided<00:00:32.689> that<00:00:32.809> we<00:00:32.930> needed<00:00:33.140> a<00:00:33.260> place<00:00:33.440> to

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
saral decided that we needed a place to

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.229 
saral decided that we needed a place to
live<00:00:33.769> and<00:00:33.980> to<00:00:34.040> eat<00:00:34.219> so<00:00:34.579> the<00:00:34.699> rest<00:00:34.850> of<00:00:35.030> the<00:00:35.089> house

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
live and to eat so the rest of the house

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.410 
live and to eat so the rest of the house
is<00:00:35.480> attached<00:00:35.989> to<00:00:36.230> it<00:00:36.379> and<00:00:36.729> it<00:00:37.729> became<00:00:38.000> our<00:00:38.210> home

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
is attached to it and it became our home

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.650

and<00:00:38.750> we<00:00:38.809> moved<00:00:39.290> in<00:00:39.530> as<00:00:39.739> i<00:00:39.860> said<00:00:40.040> in<00:00:40.129> 1974

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.069 

well<00:00:44.380> it's<00:00:44.650> unusual<00:00:45.340> to<00:00:45.370> find<00:00:45.489> in<00:00:45.850> a<00:00:45.940> home<00:00:46.150> but

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
you have to have I would say interest in

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.440 
you have to have I would say interest in
quality<00:00:50.500> music<00:00:50.620> and<00:00:51.100> then<00:00:51.370> certainly<00:00:52.270> in

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
quality music and then certainly in

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.500 
quality music and then certainly in
quality<00:00:53.110> organ<00:00:54.040> sound<00:00:54.370> and<00:00:54.820> we<00:00:55.239> feel<00:00:55.480> like

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
quality organ sound and we feel like

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.470 
quality organ sound and we feel like
that<00:00:56.050> we've<00:00:56.410> captured<00:00:56.680> both<00:00:57.070> to<00:00:58.059> the<00:00:58.090> best<00:00:58.360> of

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
that we've captured both to the best of

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.200 
that we've captured both to the best of
our<00:00:58.600> ability<00:00:59.110> in<00:00:59.309> here<00:01:00.309> are<00:01:00.730> the<00:01:00.850> drivers

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
our ability in here are the drivers

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.030 
our ability in here are the drivers
these<00:01:01.629> are<00:01:01.780> the<00:01:01.870> thing<00:01:02.080> that<00:01:02.379> physically

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
these are the thing that physically

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.270 
these are the thing that physically
drive<00:01:03.489> the<00:01:04.420> valves<00:01:04.839> under<00:01:05.050> the<00:01:05.140> pipe<00:01:05.350> so<00:01:06.070> this

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
drive the valves under the pipe so this

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.280 
drive the valves under the pipe so this
is<00:01:06.310> the<00:01:06.640> brain<00:01:07.030> this<00:01:07.690> is<00:01:07.900> the<00:01:08.050> digital

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
is the brain this is the digital

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.270 
is the brain this is the digital
interface<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:10.600> console<00:01:11.110> to<00:01:11.710> the<00:01:11.830> pipework

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
interface of the console to the pipework

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.660 
interface of the console to the pipework
and<00:01:12.570> all<00:01:13.570> the<00:01:13.780> information<00:01:14.410> comes<00:01:14.650> from<00:01:14.979> the

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
and all the information comes from the

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.760 
and all the information comes from the
organ<00:01:16.030> console<00:01:16.509> through<00:01:16.930> two<00:01:17.229> small<00:01:17.470> wires

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
organ console through two small wires

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.160 
organ console through two small wires
here<00:01:18.130> and<00:01:18.399> of<00:01:19.330> course<00:01:19.540> the<00:01:19.660> small<00:01:19.899> pipe

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
here and of course the small pipe

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.969 
here and of course the small pipe
working<00:01:20.560> here<00:01:20.920> is<00:01:21.750> all<00:01:22.750> part<00:01:23.560> of<00:01:23.649> the<00:01:23.740> great

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
working here is all part of the great

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.609 
working here is all part of the great
organ<00:01:24.369> so<00:01:24.880> it<00:01:25.030> has<00:01:25.240> principles<00:01:25.720> in<00:01:26.140> the<00:01:26.229> octave

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
organ so it has principles in the octave

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.499 
organ so it has principles in the octave
there<00:01:26.770> is<00:01:26.920> nothing<00:01:27.430> else<00:01:27.550> out<00:01:27.850> there<00:01:28.119> that<00:01:28.149> has

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
there is nothing else out there that has

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.900 
there is nothing else out there that has
the<00:01:28.750> grandeur<00:01:29.140> that<00:01:29.289> has<00:01:29.680> the<00:01:29.860> power<00:01:30.100> that<00:01:30.729> has

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
the grandeur that has the power that has

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.160 
the grandeur that has the power that has
the<00:01:31.149> color<00:01:31.450> and<00:01:32.399> so<00:01:33.399> obviously<00:01:34.149> it's<00:01:34.479> a<00:01:34.660> great

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
the color and so obviously it's a great

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.870 
the color and so obviously it's a great
excitement<00:01:35.680> when<00:01:36.310> everything<00:01:36.610> is<00:01:36.700> working

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
excitement when everything is working

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.300 
excitement when everything is working
correctly<00:01:37.200> this<00:01:38.200> is<00:01:38.380> a<00:01:38.410> great<00:01:38.950> stress

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310
