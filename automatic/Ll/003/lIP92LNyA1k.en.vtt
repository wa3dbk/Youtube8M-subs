OOP<00:02:08.820> and<00:02:09.000> that's<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.930> trick<00:02:10.290> to<00:02:10.470> get<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:10.950> know

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
OOP and that's the trick to get you know

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.870 
OOP and that's the trick to get you know
this<00:02:11.370> effect<00:02:11.960> now<00:02:12.960> that's<00:02:13.470> one<00:02:13.830> thing<00:02:14.100> so<00:02:14.640> this

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
this effect now that's one thing so this

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.430 
this effect now that's one thing so this
is<00:02:15.060> just<00:02:15.210> you<00:02:15.390> know<00:02:15.420> some<00:02:15.750> piece<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:15.930> foam<00:02:16.230> that

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
I found so basically you know the point

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.810 
I found so basically you know the point
is<00:02:18.720> what<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.380> want<00:02:19.620> is<00:02:19.800> something<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:20.700> so

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
did that to a piano and I think he

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.339

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
a big leap of faith hoping that it's
