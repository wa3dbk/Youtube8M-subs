simplicity<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.380> freeness<00:00:29.160> if<00:00:29.699> that's<00:00:30.150> a

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
simplicity and the freeness if that's a

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.389 
simplicity and the freeness if that's a
word<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:30.570> guess<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.900> cheapness<00:00:31.830> whatever<00:00:32.309> I

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
word I guess the cheapness whatever I

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.670 
word I guess the cheapness whatever I
like<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.120> fact<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.420> scam<00:00:33.840> studio<00:00:34.200> is<00:00:34.350> free

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
like the fact that scam studio is free

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.709

Maker<00:02:23.989> several<00:02:24.920> others<00:02:25.220> do<00:02:25.370> so<00:02:25.550> you<00:02:25.610> might

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
Maker several others do so you might

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.250 
Maker several others do so you might
have<00:02:25.849> to<00:02:25.970> experiment<00:02:26.239> around<00:02:26.540> but<00:02:26.930> this<00:02:27.050> will

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
have to experiment around but this will

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.320 
have to experiment around but this will
get<00:02:27.410> you<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.739> best<00:02:27.950> quality<00:02:28.250> and<00:02:28.819> the

get you the best quality and the

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.570 
get you the best quality and the
smallest<00:02:29.690> file<00:02:29.989> size<00:02:30.020> okay<00:02:30.800> so<00:02:30.860> that's<00:02:31.310> it<00:02:31.459> for

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
smallest file size okay so that's it for

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.520 
smallest file size okay so that's it for
my<00:02:31.670> tutorial<00:02:32.239> showing<00:02:32.569> you<00:02:32.720> how<00:02:32.870> to<00:02:32.900> record
