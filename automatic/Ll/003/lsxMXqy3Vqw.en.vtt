and now we're going to tenderize it this
is<00:01:48.750> not<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.229> same<00:01:49.440> kind<00:01:49.650> of<00:01:49.770> tenderizing<00:01:50.400> that

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
is not the same kind of tenderizing that

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.860 
is not the same kind of tenderizing that
you<00:01:50.610> might<00:01:50.790> see<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.060> American<00:01:51.420> homes<00:01:51.570> where

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
would do now is if I wasn't gonna make

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.680 
would do now is if I wasn't gonna make
this<00:02:48.160> in<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.340> next<00:02:48.489> day<00:02:48.700> or<00:02:48.730> two<00:02:48.850> I<00:02:49.180> would<00:02:49.480> put

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
this in the next day or two I would put

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.350 
this in the next day or two I would put
it<00:02:49.780> into<00:02:50.140> an<00:02:50.440> airtight<00:02:50.709> a<00:02:51.340> ziploc<00:02:51.850> bag<00:02:52.060> and

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
it into an airtight a ziploc bag and

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.180 
it into an airtight a ziploc bag and
freeze<00:02:52.480> it<00:02:52.750> but<00:02:53.319> if<00:02:53.410> I<00:02:53.470> was<00:02:53.650> gonna<00:02:53.769> make<00:02:54.010> it<00:02:54.040> in

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
freeze it but if I was gonna make it in

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.470 
freeze it but if I was gonna make it in
the<00:02:54.250> next<00:02:54.400> day<00:02:54.580> or<00:02:54.610> two<00:02:54.760> I<00:02:54.880> would<00:02:55.120> just<00:02:55.269> seal

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
the next day or two I would just seal

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.259 
the next day or two I would just seal
this<00:02:55.660> up<00:02:55.870> nicely<00:02:56.140> and<00:02:56.410> put<00:02:56.560> it<00:02:56.680> in<00:02:56.799> the<00:02:56.890> fridge

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
this up nicely and put it in the fridge

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.819 
this up nicely and put it in the fridge
and<00:02:58.269> ideally<00:02:59.170> you<00:02:59.290> can<00:02:59.470> leave<00:02:59.680> it<00:02:59.799> for

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
and ideally you can leave it for

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.920 
and ideally you can leave it for
overnight<00:03:00.459> so<00:03:00.640> it<00:03:00.700> has<00:03:00.880> some<00:03:01.150> time<00:03:01.450> to

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
overnight so it has some time to

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.599 
overnight so it has some time to
marinate<00:03:02.470> and<00:03:02.680> get<00:03:02.829> the<00:03:02.920> little<00:03:03.040> seasonings

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:03.609 
marinate and get the little seasonings

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:06.660 
marinate and get the little seasonings
in<00:03:03.760> there<00:03:04.260> so<00:03:05.260> what<00:03:05.829> we'll<00:03:05.980> do<00:03:06.160> is<00:03:06.190> tomorrow

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
in there so what we'll do is tomorrow

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.190 
in there so what we'll do is tomorrow
we're<00:03:06.880> going<00:03:06.970> to<00:03:07.060> go<00:03:07.150> ahead<00:03:07.299> and<00:03:07.630> turn<00:03:07.900> this

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
we're going to go ahead and turn this

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.500

these these seasoned and chicken thighs

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.780 
these these seasoned and chicken thighs
and<00:03:10.540> should<00:03:11.079> be<00:03:11.230> really<00:03:11.590> rich<00:03:11.950> yellow<00:03:12.370> curry

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790
