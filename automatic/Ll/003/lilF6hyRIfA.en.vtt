damage<00:00:22.769> of<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:22.980> m4<00:00:23.310> he<00:00:23.400> lead<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.730> an<00:00:23.850> average

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
damage of the m4 he lead is an average

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.810 
damage of the m4 he lead is an average
m4<00:00:24.689> scouring<00:00:25.170> somewhere<00:00:25.470> between<00:00:25.650> 28<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.340> 30

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
m4 scouring somewhere between 28 and 30

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.849 
m4 scouring somewhere between 28 and 30
damage<00:00:27.119> when<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:27.810> first<00:00:28.109> got<00:00:28.230> my<00:00:28.349> hands<00:00:28.650> on<00:00:28.710> this

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
damage when I first got my hands on this

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.560 
damage when I first got my hands on this
I<00:00:29.010> thought<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.340> was<00:00:29.460> way<00:00:29.760> worse<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.330> actually

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
I thought it was way worse I actually

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.330 
I thought it was way worse I actually
thought<00:00:30.900> they<00:00:31.109> nerfed<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.619> shit<00:00:31.949> out<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.160> it

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
thought they nerfed the shit out of it

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.090

would<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.090> make<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.239> fucking<00:00:54.629> import<00:00:54.960> custom

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
would you make a fucking import custom

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.660 
would you make a fucking import custom
remake<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.620> then<00:00:55.710> put<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.860> fucking<00:00:56.250> zoom<00:00:56.430> on<00:00:56.579> it

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
remake and then put a fucking zoom on it

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.200 
remake and then put a fucking zoom on it
when<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.850> original<00:00:57.210> has<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> fucking<00:00:57.750> scope

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
when the original has a fucking scope

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.030 
when the original has a fucking scope
crossfire<00:01:00.620> why<00:01:02.690> anyway<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.140> zoom<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.559> useful

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.090 
crossfire why anyway the zoom is useful
the<00:01:05.760> accuracy<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.479> zoom<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.930> actually<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.590> help

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
the accuracy in zoom is actually a help

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.399 
the accuracy in zoom is actually a help
unlike<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.670> fucking<00:01:09.000> Winchester<00:01:09.540> scope<00:01:09.810> so

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
unlike the fucking Winchester scope so

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.060 
unlike the fucking Winchester scope so
I'll<00:01:10.560> give<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:11.010> crossfire<00:01:11.810> it's

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
I'll give you that crossfire it's

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.789 
I'll give you that crossfire it's
actually<00:01:14.070> does<00:01:14.310> damage<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:15.540> there<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.380> go<00:01:16.560> I

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
actually does damage so there you go I

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.770 
actually does damage so there you go I
still<00:01:17.490> find<00:01:17.640> myself<00:01:17.729> out<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.150> scope<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:18.600> most

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
still find myself out of scope in most

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.600 
still find myself out of scope in most
situations<00:01:18.930> but<00:01:19.619> at<00:01:19.890> least<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:20.250> doesn't

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
situations but at least this doesn't

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.429 
situations but at least this doesn't
limit<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.880> gun<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.240> just<00:01:21.479> close<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:21.930> mid<00:01:22.170> range

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
limit the gun to just close in mid range

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.859 
limit the gun to just close in mid range
and<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.400> scope<00:01:23.580> makes<00:01:23.909> long<00:01:24.240> range<00:01:24.479> killing

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
and the scope makes long range killing

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.170 
and the scope makes long range killing
actually<00:01:25.259> fairly<00:01:25.530> easy<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.850> does<00:01:27.030> what

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
actually fairly easy so it does what

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.789 
actually fairly easy so it does what
it's<00:01:27.330> supposed<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.720> do<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.259> reload<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.619> the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
it's supposed to do the reload of the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.530 
it's supposed to do the reload of the
elite<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.159> same<00:01:29.460> as<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.729> m4<00:01:29.880> custom<00:01:30.390> and

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
elite is the same as the m4 custom and

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.730 
elite is the same as the m4 custom and
if<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.689> don't<00:01:30.930> believe<00:01:31.200> me<00:01:31.409> here's<00:01:31.680> a

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
if you don't believe me here's a

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.030 
if you don't believe me here's a
comparison

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.860 

so<00:01:37.040> they're<00:01:37.220> both<00:01:37.310> about<00:01:37.610> 2.15<00:01:38.180> seconds

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
so they're both about 2.15 seconds

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.720 
so they're both about 2.15 seconds
that's<00:01:39.140> as<00:01:39.320> quick<00:01:39.590> so<00:01:40.040> the<00:01:40.190> elite<00:01:40.430> allows<00:01:40.610> you

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:40.730 
that's as quick so the elite allows you

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.250 
that's as quick so the elite allows you
to<00:01:40.820> be<00:01:40.970> quick<00:01:41.180> about<00:01:41.300> reloading<00:01:41.870> you<00:01:41.930> can<00:01:42.080> jump

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
to be quick about reloading you can jump

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.720 
to be quick about reloading you can jump
back<00:01:42.380> into<00:01:42.650> the<00:01:42.770> action<00:01:43.040> and<00:01:43.160> butt-fuck<00:01:43.520> some

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730

this<00:02:01.160> thing<00:02:01.340> has<00:02:01.490> a<00:02:01.520> fucking<00:02:01.940> zoom<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:02.660> in

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
this thing has a fucking zoom the in

scope<00:02:03.110> firing<00:02:03.440> rate<00:02:03.590> is<00:02:03.680> probably<00:02:04.070> slower<00:02:04.460> I'm

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
scope firing rate is probably slower I'm

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.969 
scope firing rate is probably slower I'm
just<00:02:05.240> gonna<00:02:05.360> go<00:02:05.540> by<00:02:05.690> that<00:02:05.840> judgment<00:02:06.350> but<00:02:06.860> the

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
just gonna go by that judgment but the

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.770 
just gonna go by that judgment but the
reason<00:02:07.310> you<00:02:07.400> would<00:02:07.520> be<00:02:07.640> spraying<00:02:08.060> in<00:02:08.270> scope<00:02:08.540> is

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
reason you would be spraying in scope is

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.320 
reason you would be spraying in scope is
beyond<00:02:09.259> me<00:02:09.440> in<00:02:09.890> other<00:02:10.250> words<00:02:10.489> don't<00:02:10.880> do<00:02:11.120> that

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
beyond me in other words don't do that

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.170 
beyond me in other words don't do that
and<00:02:11.660> the<00:02:12.470> ammo<00:02:12.620> for<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.040> elite<00:02:13.310> is<00:02:13.459> 3500<00:02:13.970> to

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
and the ammo for the elite is 3500 to

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.300 
and the ammo for the elite is 3500 to
105<00:02:14.840> which<00:02:15.140> is<00:02:15.320> the<00:02:15.470> same<00:02:15.650> as<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:15.920> custom

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
105 which is the same as the custom

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.800 
105 which is the same as the custom
which<00:02:16.550> just<00:02:16.910> further<00:02:18.040> agrees<00:02:19.040> with<00:02:19.310> my<00:02:19.810> idea

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
which just further agrees with my idea
