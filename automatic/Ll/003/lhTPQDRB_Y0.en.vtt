00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.010 
honest no oh yeah baby pushes him right
here<00:01:59.490> actually<00:01:59.700> it's<00:02:00.150> based<00:02:00.360> on<00:02:00.480> baby<00:02:00.720> after

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
here actually it's based on baby after

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.359 
here actually it's based on baby after
the<00:02:01.110> wager<00:02:01.290> he<00:02:01.530> gets<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.770> neutral<00:02:02.070> advantage

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
the wager he gets the neutral advantage

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.090 
the wager he gets the neutral advantage
but<00:02:02.610> as<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.270> can<00:02:03.390> see<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:04.200> best<00:02:04.440> is<00:02:04.650> squirting

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
but as you can see the best is squirting

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:12.170 
but as you can see the best is squirting
up<00:02:05.190> for<00:02:05.369> less<00:02:05.490> oh<00:02:09.200> that's<00:02:10.200> so<00:02:10.440> cool<00:02:11.000> that's<00:02:12.000> not

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
up for less oh that's so cool that's not

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.900 
up for less oh that's so cool that's not
fair<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.480> is<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.930> best<00:02:13.700> interactable<00:02:14.700> in

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
fair that is the best interactable in

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.580 
fair that is the best interactable in
the<00:02:15.000> game<00:02:15.180> that<00:02:15.390> was<00:02:15.480> upper<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:15.930> go<00:02:16.020> for<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.320> tiny

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
the game that was upper to go for a tiny

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.430 
the game that was upper to go for a tiny
character<00:02:17.150> that<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.180> just<00:02:18.780> above<00:02:19.080> pigs

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
character that is just above pigs

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.680 
character that is just above pigs
because<00:02:19.680> pig<00:02:20.430> is<00:02:20.580> fast<00:02:20.820> and<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.150> covers<00:02:21.270> area

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
because pig is fast and it covers area

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.900 
because pig is fast and it covers area
but<00:02:22.470> unless<00:02:22.830> you've<00:02:23.040> got<00:02:23.070> a<00:02:23.220> good<00:02:23.459> reversal

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
but unless you've got a good reversal

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:24.910 
but unless you've got a good reversal
you're<00:02:24.060> not<00:02:24.180> getting<00:02:24.390> away<00:02:24.480> from<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:24.780> thing
