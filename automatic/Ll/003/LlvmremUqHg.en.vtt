00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
use a pan spray with flour I like to

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.960 
use a pan spray with flour I like to
make<00:00:25.200> pan<00:00:25.530> grease<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.460> way<00:00:26.580> that<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:26.789> make

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
make pan grease and the way that I make

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.770 
make pan grease and the way that I make
pan<00:00:27.210> grease<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.780> by<00:00:27.990> taking<00:00:28.260> flour<00:00:28.920> and

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:29.780 
pan grease is by taking flour and

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.279 
pan grease is by taking flour and
vegetable<00:00:30.780> oil<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:32.059> shortening<00:00:33.059> now<00:00:33.629> I<00:00:33.899> tend

00:00:34.279 --> 00:00:34.289 
vegetable oil and shortening now I tend

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:36.350 
vegetable oil and shortening now I tend
to<00:00:34.379> be<00:00:34.590> brand-specific<00:00:35.070> when<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.579> can<00:00:35.910> because

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
to be brand-specific when I can because

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.760 
to be brand-specific when I can because
I<00:00:36.390> like<00:00:36.780> my<00:00:36.989> products<00:00:37.379> to<00:00:37.440> turn<00:00:37.620> out

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
I like my products to turn out

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.470 
I like my products to turn out
consistently<00:00:38.489> every<00:00:38.609> time<00:00:38.909> so<00:00:39.120> if<00:00:39.179> I'm<00:00:39.300> going

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
consistently every time so if I'm going

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.270 
consistently every time so if I'm going
to<00:00:39.539> use<00:00:39.659> a<00:00:39.690> vegetable<00:00:40.199> shortening<00:00:40.499> I'll<00:00:40.829> tend

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
to use a vegetable shortening I'll tend

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.579 
to use a vegetable shortening I'll tend
to<00:00:41.370> do<00:00:41.519> this<00:00:41.699> brand<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.749> then<00:00:42.960> for<00:00:43.199> vegetable

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:43.589 
to do this brand and then for vegetable

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:45.319 
to do this brand and then for vegetable
oil<00:00:43.679> I<00:00:43.890> kind<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.280> like<00:00:44.429> the<00:00:44.579> flavor<00:00:44.819> profiles

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
oil I kind of like the flavor profiles

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.360 
oil I kind of like the flavor profiles
are<00:00:45.510> certain<00:00:45.809> one<00:00:45.929> so<00:00:46.199> I<00:00:46.229> will<00:00:46.409> also<00:00:46.890> use<00:00:47.100> those

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
are certain one so I will also use those

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.270 
are certain one so I will also use those
so<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.940> make<00:00:48.300> pan<00:00:48.569> grease<00:00:48.979> basically<00:00:49.979> you<00:00:50.129> take

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
so to make pan grease basically you take

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.239 
so to make pan grease basically you take
equal<00:00:50.729> parts<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.149> flour<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.780> oil<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.920> of

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:53.249 
equal parts of flour of oil and of

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:55.129 
equal parts of flour of oil and of
shortening<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.909> you<00:00:53.999> mix<00:00:54.210> them<00:00:54.359> together<00:00:54.569> and

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:55.139 
shortening and you mix them together and

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:57.919 
shortening and you mix them together and
what<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.679> get<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:56.819> kind<00:00:57.179> of<00:00:57.329> almost

00:00:57.919 --> 00:00:57.929 
what you get is this kind of almost

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:00.289 
what you get is this kind of almost
liquid<00:00:58.260> gold<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.639> way<00:00:59.760> that<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.089> use

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:00.299 
liquid gold and the way that you use

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:02.149 
liquid gold and the way that you use
that<00:01:00.539> once<00:01:00.870> it's<00:01:01.049> been<00:01:01.139> blended<00:01:01.440> completely

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159 
that once it's been blended completely

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:04.130 
that once it's been blended completely
is<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.399> take<00:01:02.639> a<00:01:02.670> pastry<00:01:02.969> brush<00:01:03.359> for<00:01:04.019> this

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
is you take a pastry brush for this

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.899 
is you take a pastry brush for this
application<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.949> actually<00:01:05.070> like<00:01:05.370> to<00:01:05.400> use<00:01:05.670> one

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
application I actually like to use one

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.870 
application I actually like to use one
of<00:01:05.940> my<00:01:06.380> natural<00:01:07.380> bristle<00:01:07.799> brushes<00:01:08.070> versus<00:01:08.729> one

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
of my natural bristle brushes versus one

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.370 
of my natural bristle brushes versus one
of<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.090> silicone<00:01:09.540> ones<00:01:09.720> because<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.110> helps<00:01:10.350> me

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
of the silicone ones because it helps me

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.429 
of the silicone ones because it helps me
get<00:01:10.649> into<00:01:11.009> the<00:01:11.130> corners<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:12.229> then<00:01:13.229> what

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
get into the corners and then what

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.389 
get into the corners and then what
you're<00:01:13.560> going<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.770> do<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.130> you're<00:01:14.250> going<00:01:14.280> to

you're going to do is you're going to
take<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:14.939> you're<00:01:15.030> going<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.210> spread<00:01:15.770> that

take it and you're going to spread that

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.170 
take it and you're going to spread that
pan<00:01:17.070> grease<00:01:17.340> evenly<00:01:18.439> into<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:20.430> entire<00:01:20.759> pan

the beauty of this is that I am NOT
trying<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.359> get<00:01:24.600> grease<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.740> flour<00:01:26.340> into<00:01:27.060> the

reason<00:01:50.219> I<00:01:50.310> don't<00:01:50.520> use<00:01:50.700> butter<00:01:50.969> is<00:01:51.149> because

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
reason I don't use butter is because

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.539 
reason I don't use butter is because
butter<00:01:51.749> contains<00:01:52.289> water<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.369> air

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
butter contains water and the air

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.969 
butter contains water and the air
pockets<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.390> water<00:01:55.020> when<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.499> melts

pockets and the water when it melts

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.529 
pockets and the water when it melts
creates<00:01:56.369> moisture<00:01:56.969> which<00:01:57.149> can<00:01:57.359> cause

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
creates moisture which can cause

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:59.120 
creates moisture which can cause
sticking<00:01:58.049> when<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.259> combines<00:01:58.439> with<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.890> flour

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
sticking when it combines with the flour

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.160 
sticking when it combines with the flour
it<00:01:59.280> almost<00:01:59.520> turns<00:01:59.820> into<00:02:00.030> glue<00:02:00.390> when<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:00.929> use

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
it almost turns into glue when I use

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.569 
it almost turns into glue when I use
this<00:02:01.320> pan<00:02:01.590> grease<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:02.009> don't<00:02:02.189> have<00:02:02.399> that

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
this pan grease I don't have that

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.510 
this pan grease I don't have that
problem<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:03.840> next<00:02:04.140> step<00:02:04.319> is<00:02:04.499> to<00:02:05.069> take<00:02:05.280> my

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
problem the next step is to take my

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.340 
problem the next step is to take my
piece<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.880> parchment<00:02:06.119> paper<00:02:06.359> if<00:02:07.020> you're

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
piece of parchment paper if you're

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.169 
piece of parchment paper if you're
fortunate<00:02:07.649> enough<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.160> get<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.580> in<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.759> circle

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
fortunate enough to get it in a circle

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.370 
fortunate enough to get it in a circle
it's<00:02:09.300> great<00:02:09.569> because<00:02:09.750> it's<00:02:09.990> the<00:02:10.170> works

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
it's great because it's the works

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.470 
it's great because it's the works
already<00:02:10.679> done<00:02:10.800> for<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.880> can<00:02:12.180> take<00:02:12.210> a

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
already done for you you can take a

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.420 
already done for you you can take a
larger<00:02:13.020> piece<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.380> parchment<00:02:13.620> paper<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.220> cut

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
larger piece of parchment paper and cut

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.220 
larger piece of parchment paper and cut
it<00:02:14.580> down<00:02:14.610> into<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.120> circle<00:02:15.540> if<00:02:15.630> you'd<00:02:15.780> like<00:02:15.960> to

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
it down into a circle if you'd like to

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.280 
it down into a circle if you'd like to
make<00:02:16.380> it<00:02:16.560> fit

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
make it fit

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.199 
make it fit
but<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.950> fact<00:02:18.189> that<00:02:18.340> I<00:02:18.400> use<00:02:18.549> parchment<00:02:19.030> paper

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
but the fact that I use parchment paper

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.240 
but the fact that I use parchment paper
and<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.810> pan<00:02:20.049> grease<00:02:20.319> helps<00:02:20.890> to<00:02:21.069> make<00:02:21.219> sure

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
and the pan grease helps to make sure

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.899 
and the pan grease helps to make sure
that<00:02:21.549> I<00:02:21.609> get<00:02:21.790> a<00:02:21.819> great<00:02:22.090> release<00:02:22.480> every<00:02:22.900> time

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
that I get a great release every time

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.910 
that I get a great release every time
now<00:02:24.909> I<00:02:25.180> like<00:02:25.840> to<00:02:25.870> bake<00:02:26.230> in<00:02:26.379> pans<00:02:26.680> that<00:02:26.799> are

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
now I like to bake in pans that are

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.890 
now I like to bake in pans that are
three<00:02:27.280> inches<00:02:27.609> deep<00:02:27.849> the<00:02:28.120> reason<00:02:28.629> I<00:02:28.689> like<00:02:28.870> to

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
three inches deep the reason I like to

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.050 
three inches deep the reason I like to
do<00:02:29.170> that<00:02:29.349> is<00:02:29.500> because<00:02:29.859> it<00:02:30.010> allows<00:02:30.099> me<00:02:30.340> to<00:02:30.670> make

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
do that is because it allows me to make

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.030 
do that is because it allows me to make
a<00:02:31.090> cake<00:02:31.420> of<00:02:31.629> significant<00:02:32.260> height<00:02:32.500> without

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
a cake of significant height without

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.190 
a cake of significant height without
having<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.790> make<00:02:33.939> two<00:02:34.180> cakes<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.750> then<00:02:34.870> trim

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
having to make two cakes and then trim

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.920 
having to make two cakes and then trim
those<00:02:35.409> in<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.890> balance<00:02:36.310> when<00:02:37.030> I'm<00:02:37.269> baking<00:02:37.629> a

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
those in the balance when I'm baking a

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.440 
those in the balance when I'm baking a
very<00:02:38.470> deep<00:02:38.799> cake<00:02:39.129> or<00:02:39.370> if<00:02:39.939> I'm<00:02:40.090> going<00:02:40.269> to<00:02:40.329> be

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
very deep cake or if I'm going to be

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.330 
very deep cake or if I'm going to be
baking<00:02:40.810> in<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:41.019> diameter<00:02:41.650> that's<00:02:41.829> larger<00:02:42.310> than

baking in a diameter that's larger than

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.550 
baking in a diameter that's larger than
12<00:02:42.760> inches<00:02:42.970> I<00:02:43.359> like<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:43.870> add<00:02:44.019> a<00:02:44.049> little<00:02:44.290> bit<00:02:44.530> of

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
12 inches I like to add a little bit of

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.679 
12 inches I like to add a little bit of
additional<00:02:44.920> insurance<00:02:45.340> this<00:02:45.970> happens<00:02:46.389> to<00:02:46.569> be

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:46.689 
additional insurance this happens to be

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:48.750 
additional insurance this happens to be
a<00:02:46.719> flower<00:02:47.049> nail<00:02:47.439> and<00:02:47.709> the<00:02:48.069> way<00:02:48.219> that<00:02:48.400> it<00:02:48.489> shoes

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
a flower nail and the way that it shoes

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.970 
a flower nail and the way that it shoes
is<00:02:49.000> usually<00:02:49.510> this<00:02:49.989> way<00:02:50.260> but<00:02:50.530> when<00:02:50.680> I'm<00:02:50.799> baking

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
is usually this way but when I'm baking

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.369 
is usually this way but when I'm baking
with<00:02:51.340> it<00:02:51.489> I<00:02:51.609> turn<00:02:51.849> it<00:02:52.000> this<00:02:52.030> way<00:02:52.389> what<00:02:52.930> I<00:02:52.959> do<00:02:53.079> is

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
with it I turn it this way what I do is

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:58.530 
with it I turn it this way what I do is
I<00:02:53.500> take<00:02:53.799> my<00:02:54.450> pan<00:02:55.450> grease<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:55.989> I<00:02:56.049> brush<00:02:56.319> it<00:02:57.540> the

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
I take my pan grease and I brush it the

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.309 
I take my pan grease and I brush it the
flower<00:02:58.750> nail<00:02:59.109> and<00:03:00.090> then<00:03:01.090> I<00:03:01.150> actually<00:03:01.870> stick<00:03:02.169> it

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
flower nail and then I actually stick it

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.190 
flower nail and then I actually stick it
underneath<00:03:03.269> my<00:03:04.269> parchment<00:03:04.599> paper<00:03:04.930> so<00:03:05.049> I'm

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
underneath my parchment paper so I'm

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.440 
underneath my parchment paper so I'm
going<00:03:05.379> to<00:03:05.439> pierce<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.859> center<00:03:06.280> of<00:03:06.340> this<00:03:06.519> and<00:03:07.389> I

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
going to pierce the center of this and I

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.199 
going to pierce the center of this and I
let<00:03:07.750> it<00:03:07.870> sit<00:03:08.079> in<00:03:08.169> the<00:03:08.290> bottom<00:03:08.560> of<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:08.769> pan<00:03:09.209> the

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
let it sit in the bottom of the pan the

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.780 
let it sit in the bottom of the pan the
way<00:03:10.450> that<00:03:10.659> this<00:03:10.840> works<00:03:11.200> is<00:03:11.439> now<00:03:11.859> there's<00:03:12.669> a

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
way that this works is now there's a

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.360 
way that this works is now there's a
heating<00:03:13.299> core<00:03:13.629> in<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:14.049> center<00:03:14.079> of<00:03:14.799> my<00:03:15.040> cake<00:03:15.340> so

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
heating core in the center of my cake so

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.179 
heating core in the center of my cake so
that<00:03:15.669> the<00:03:15.879> heat<00:03:16.750> radiates<00:03:17.409> from<00:03:17.709> the<00:03:17.829> inside

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:18.189 
that the heat radiates from the inside

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:20.220 
that the heat radiates from the inside
out<00:03:18.400> and<00:03:18.669> from<00:03:18.970> the<00:03:19.090> outside<00:03:19.480> end<00:03:19.750> so<00:03:19.989> I<00:03:20.019> have<00:03:20.200> a

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
out and from the outside end so I have a

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.259 
out and from the outside end so I have a
better<00:03:20.620> chance<00:03:20.709> of<00:03:21.159> getting<00:03:21.310> a<00:03:21.549> very<00:03:21.849> evenly

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
better chance of getting a very evenly

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.599 
better chance of getting a very evenly
baked<00:03:22.599> cake<00:03:22.870> without<00:03:23.260> over<00:03:23.620> baking<00:03:23.979> it<00:03:24.129> one

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
baked cake without over baking it one

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.430 
baked cake without over baking it one
thing<00:03:24.790> I<00:03:24.879> absolutely<00:03:25.060> hate<00:03:25.629> is<00:03:25.840> to<00:03:25.870> take<00:03:26.409> a

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
thing I absolutely hate is to take a

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.899 
thing I absolutely hate is to take a
beautiful<00:03:26.650> cake<00:03:27.040> out<00:03:27.190> of<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.310> oven<00:03:27.370> and<00:03:27.669> find

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:29.069 
beautiful cake out of the oven and find
out<00:03:28.060> that<00:03:28.180> it<00:03:28.299> wasn't<00:03:28.479> cooked<00:03:28.780> all<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:29.049> way

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
out that it wasn't cooked all the way

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.199 
out that it wasn't cooked all the way
through<00:03:29.199> it's<00:03:30.010> good<00:03:30.250> for<00:03:30.430> my<00:03:30.549> hips<00:03:30.790> but<00:03:31.060> it's

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
through it's good for my hips but it's

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:32.849 
through it's good for my hips but it's
not<00:03:31.419> good<00:03:31.629> for<00:03:31.659> whatever<00:03:32.049> project<00:03:32.440> I<00:03:32.709> was

will<00:03:37.959> help<00:03:38.109> the<00:03:38.290> cake<00:03:38.470> bake<00:03:38.709> evenly<00:03:39.099> this

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:39.729 
will help the cake bake evenly this

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:42.030 
will help the cake bake evenly this
happens<00:03:40.299> to<00:03:40.540> be<00:03:40.569> a<00:03:40.690> metallo<00:03:41.109> sized<00:03:41.440> strip<00:03:41.799> and

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.759 
happens to be a metallo sized strip and
it<00:03:42.400> also<00:03:42.549> has<00:03:42.970> velcro<00:03:43.269> on<00:03:43.659> it<00:03:43.720> what<00:03:44.379> you<00:03:44.530> want

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
it also has velcro on it what you want

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.460 
it also has velcro on it what you want
to<00:03:44.859> do<00:03:45.040> is<00:03:45.250> to<00:03:45.400> take<00:03:45.609> the<00:03:45.819> strip<00:03:46.180> and<00:03:46.470> immerse

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
to do is to take the strip and immerse

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.789 
to do is to take the strip and immerse
it<00:03:47.650> in<00:03:47.739> water<00:03:48.150> it<00:03:49.150> can<00:03:49.750> only<00:03:49.989> be<00:03:50.229> used<00:03:50.470> if<00:03:50.620> it's

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
it in water it can only be used if it's

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.030 
it in water it can only be used if it's
wet<00:03:50.979> and<00:03:51.870> once<00:03:52.870> it<00:03:53.019> is<00:03:53.049> fully<00:03:53.379> immersed<00:03:53.739> I

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
wet and once it is fully immersed I

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.759 
wet and once it is fully immersed I
don't<00:03:54.220> need<00:03:54.370> it<00:03:54.489> to<00:03:54.519> be<00:03:54.699> sopping<00:03:55.239> wet<00:03:55.560> but<00:03:56.560> wet

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
don't need it to be sopping wet but wet

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.099 
don't need it to be sopping wet but wet
enough<00:03:57.299> I'm<00:03:58.299> going<00:03:58.510> to<00:03:58.569> remove<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:59.019> excess

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
enough I'm going to remove the excess

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:04.890 
enough I'm going to remove the excess
liquid<00:04:02.609> so<00:04:03.609> it<00:04:03.729> won't<00:04:03.909> drip<00:04:04.120> all<00:04:04.359> over<00:04:04.389> and

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
liquid so it won't drip all over and

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.390 
liquid so it won't drip all over and
then<00:04:05.889> I'm<00:04:06.010> going<00:04:06.159> to<00:04:06.400> wrap<00:04:07.139> it<00:04:08.139> around<00:04:08.260> the<00:04:08.560> pan

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
then I'm going to wrap it around the pan

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.710 
then I'm going to wrap it around the pan
basically<00:04:10.400> what<00:04:10.640> happens<00:04:11.060> when<00:04:11.210> I<00:04:11.240> use<00:04:11.330> this

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
basically what happens when I use this

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.350 
basically what happens when I use this
trip<00:04:12.110> is<00:04:12.290> that<00:04:12.350> the<00:04:13.220> heat<00:04:13.550> when<00:04:13.850> it<00:04:13.970> hits<00:04:14.180> the

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
trip is that the heat when it hits the

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.630 
trip is that the heat when it hits the
pan<00:04:14.420> has<00:04:15.290> to<00:04:15.500> gradually<00:04:16.070> go<00:04:16.250> through<00:04:16.490> the

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
pan has to gradually go through the

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.300 
pan has to gradually go through the
moisture<00:04:17.150> here<00:04:17.540> so<00:04:17.810> that<00:04:18.050> it<00:04:18.350> gradually<00:04:18.770> gets

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
moisture here so that it gradually gets

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.160 
moisture here so that it gradually gets
warmer<00:04:19.880> through<00:04:20.120> the<00:04:20.239> center<00:04:20.660> and<00:04:20.690> it's<00:04:20.959> not

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
warmer through the center and it's not

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.410 
warmer through the center and it's not
causing<00:04:21.500> the<00:04:21.800> outsides<00:04:22.430> of<00:04:22.610> the<00:04:22.670> cake<00:04:22.970> to<00:04:23.180> set

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
causing the outsides of the cake to set

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.810 
causing the outsides of the cake to set
instantly<00:04:24.080> and<00:04:24.230> cook<00:04:24.470> without<00:04:25.040> this<00:04:25.490> strip

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
instantly and cook without this strip

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.940 
instantly and cook without this strip
the<00:04:26.330> heat<00:04:26.630> hits<00:04:26.870> the<00:04:27.140> side<00:04:27.350> of<00:04:27.500> the<00:04:27.590> pan<00:04:27.800> it

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
the heat hits the side of the pan it

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.580 
the heat hits the side of the pan it
gets<00:04:28.130> super<00:04:28.340> hot<00:04:28.760> the<00:04:29.300> cake<00:04:29.870> closest<00:04:30.320> to<00:04:30.470> the

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
gets super hot the cake closest to the

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.070 
gets super hot the cake closest to the
edge<00:04:30.740> cooks<00:04:31.670> first<00:04:32.060> and<00:04:32.420> then<00:04:32.540> the<00:04:32.660> center

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
edge cooks first and then the center

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.190 
edge cooks first and then the center
cannot<00:04:33.590> stay<00:04:34.100> evenly<00:04:34.670> moist<00:04:35.450> it<00:04:35.780> actually

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
cannot stay evenly moist it actually

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.320 
cannot stay evenly moist it actually
rises<00:04:36.710> up<00:04:36.860> in<00:04:37.040> domes<00:04:37.340> which<00:04:37.610> is<00:04:37.760> usually<00:04:38.180> what

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
rises up in domes which is usually what

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.180 
rises up in domes which is usually what
happens<00:04:38.360> when<00:04:39.170> you<00:04:39.290> have<00:04:39.440> a<00:04:39.470> cake<00:04:39.770> that<00:04:39.800> gets<00:04:40.100> a

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
happens when you have a cake that gets a

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.740 
happens when you have a cake that gets a
tremendous<00:04:40.340> dome<00:04:40.850> on<00:04:41.060> it<00:04:41.210> so<00:04:41.360> this<00:04:41.510> way<00:04:41.690> you

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
tremendous dome on it so this way you

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.360 
tremendous dome on it so this way you
don't<00:04:42.020> have<00:04:42.110> as<00:04:42.350> much<00:04:42.500> frustration<00:04:43.190> when

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
don't have as much frustration when

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:49.020 
don't have as much frustration when
you're<00:04:43.490> working<00:04:43.820> with<00:04:43.850> your<00:04:44.090> cake

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.090 

you
