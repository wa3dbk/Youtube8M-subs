 Dnipropetrovsk basic chemistry teacher 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.920
 health tatyana yes and bliss decided 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.810
 after a medical examination at school

 I am sure that the earth and they and even their children 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.739
 tula jars insulate not crackers not 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.420

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.489
 rodents teens bought in agrarian 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.769
 the university was divided into 4 groups 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.530
 inhabitants the first cells fed chips 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:54.899
 in the second, rats ate crackers in 3 vegetables with 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.309
 food additives a menu for these 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.129
 experimental high school student Sergey 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.379
 personally made their diet fresh make 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.059
 from the parent garden and wheat and and 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:09.229
 student for the purity of the experiment 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:12.240
 I grew myself definitely there are no additives 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.799
 in the ward Sergei play and frolic to 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.170
 so far about what happened to the rest 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.299
 rodents schoolchildren remember with horror 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.670
 the test subjects survived for only 20 days 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.649
 malnutrition we came one 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.600
 glue times we saw rats that 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.549
 fed on chips practically bald from them 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.350
 our eyes were closed we became their very 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.600
 sorry we decided to stop the experiment 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.490
 after that I bypass the side and the divisions in 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.710
 supermarket where these products are sold 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.820
 the experiment was closely watched 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.680
 Agrarian University 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.539
 all deviations in behavior state 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.399
 experimental health research staff 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:43.530
 noted in the journal of animals 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.570
 photographed later in the laboratory 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.030
 it turned out that those rodents 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.439
 fed on potato crisps and feed 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.329
 adding flavorings 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.850
 upset digestion deteriorated eyesight 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:58.130
 and the liver began to decompose and liver 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.340
 yellowish clay color indicates 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.750
 the fact that the liver cells are filled with live 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.509
 like faces 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.820
 and devices of newspapers managed to blame the teacher 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.130
 chemistry in animal abuse but 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.420
 experience that helped many teens 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.610
 refuse junk food 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.560
 held in extracurricular activities with 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.450
 permission of parents of high school students and 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.940
 school directors and the students themselves 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.890
 confirm other arguments would not be 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.050
 so convincing to the original not skoda 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.970
 from their screwed up of course I feel sorry for these rats 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.100
 people use these products 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.930
 if the animal does not give junk food alone 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.930
 active ie these additives are not needed 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.890
 kids even reviewed the menu darling of 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.260
 hall corner 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.300
 guinea pig love diet only 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.650
 vegetables and fruits and now students 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.250

 educational film about the dangers of fast food 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.819
 an unusual lesson in healthy eating 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.680
 Ukrainian scientists are interested here 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.209
 at the institute of food technology sure 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.100
 what make children and teenagers 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.230
 refuse junk food can only 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.000
 showed a video with an experiment 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.860
 Dnepropetrovsk schoolchildren still 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.049
 other methods were not so 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.579
 effective vitaliy kotenko sergey
