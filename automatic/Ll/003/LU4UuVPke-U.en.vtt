do is come up to this altar here and the

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.470 
do is come up to this altar here and the
shadow<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.260> appears<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.190> exactly<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.270> same

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
shadow that appears is exactly the same

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.270 
shadow that appears is exactly the same
or<00:00:49.020> has<00:00:49.230> all<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.559> equipment<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.129> have

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
or has all the equipment that you have

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.650 
or has all the equipment that you have
on<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:51.449> pretty<00:00:51.719> much<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.899> duplicate<00:00:53.239> so<00:00:54.239> I

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
on and is pretty much a duplicate so I

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.569 
on and is pretty much a duplicate so I
didn't<00:00:55.170> do<00:00:55.320> anything<00:00:55.590> with<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:55.890> standing<00:00:56.370> so

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
didn't do anything with that standing so

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.580 
didn't do anything with that standing so
and<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.760> just<00:00:56.969> thought<00:00:57.930> that's<00:00:58.109> what<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.410> had<00:00:58.559> to

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
and I just thought that's what I had to

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.619 
and I just thought that's what I had to
do<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.920> activate<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.430> but<00:00:59.609> he<00:00:59.850> came<00:01:00.149> up<00:01:00.390> and

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
do is activate it but he came up and

do is activate it but he came up and
what<00:01:00.840> you're<00:01:00.899> gonna<00:01:01.050> do<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.559> wait<00:01:02.399> for<00:01:02.430> him<00:01:02.670> to

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
what you're gonna do is wait for him to

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.329 
what you're gonna do is wait for him to
pull<00:01:02.969> out<00:01:03.090> his<00:01:03.239> sword<00:01:03.680> it<00:01:04.680> sucks<00:01:05.010> when<00:01:05.129> he<00:01:05.220> goes
