00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
and that is due to the fact that

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.220 
and that is due to the fact that
unfortunately<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.489> player<00:00:53.850> or<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.930> planet

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
unfortunately the player or the planet

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.979 
unfortunately the player or the planet
naboo<00:00:55.670> was<00:00:56.670> capped<00:00:57.090> on<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.600> number<00:00:57.870> of

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
naboo was capped on the number of

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.720 
naboo was capped on the number of
players<00:00:58.289> cities<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.160> were<00:00:59.280> able<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.579> be

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
players cities that were able to be

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.319 
players cities that were able to be
placed<00:01:00.410> so<00:01:01.640> we<00:01:02.640> had<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.820> do<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> little<00:01:03.149> bit<00:01:03.239> of

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
placed so we had to do a little bit of

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.560 
placed so we had to do a little bit of
scouting<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.049> our<00:01:04.589> next<00:01:04.949> best<00:01:05.129> option<00:01:05.760> was<00:01:06.390> to

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
scouting and our next best option was to

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.080 
scouting and our next best option was to
start<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.280> city<00:01:08.280> on<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.580> planet<00:01:08.820> Locke<00:01:09.799> now

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
start a city on the planet Locke now

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.149 
start a city on the planet Locke now
Locke<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.390> connected<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.080> both<00:01:13.350> Naboo<00:01:13.890> and

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
Locke is connected to both Naboo and

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.399 
Locke is connected to both Naboo and
Tatooine<00:01:14.700> on<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.119> galaxy<00:01:15.600> map<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:16.200> only

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
Tatooine on the galaxy map so it is only

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.410 
Tatooine on the galaxy map so it is only
one<00:01:16.680> jump<00:01:16.920> away<00:01:17.040> from<00:01:17.189> two<00:01:17.610> starter<00:01:18.030> worlds
