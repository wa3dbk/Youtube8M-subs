you<00:00:53.610> these<00:00:53.940> are<00:00:54.000> two<00:00:54.270> butter<00:00:54.600> dishes<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:55.170> I

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
you these are two butter dishes that I

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.950 
you these are two butter dishes that I

had glued together and I spray painted
both<00:00:58.320> sides<00:00:58.590> inside<00:00:59.809> so<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.840> thought<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.170> looks

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
both sides inside so I thought it looks

reasons one is when you stick it on they

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.609 
reasons one is when you stick it on they
lay<00:01:31.500> flat<00:01:31.530> if<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.460> use<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:33.060> glue<00:01:33.450> gun<00:01:33.619> it's

lay flat if you use a glue gun it's

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.219 
lay flat if you use a glue gun it's
going<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.890> be<00:01:34.979> raised<00:01:35.220> up<00:01:35.520> if<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.390> use<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.960> if

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
going to be raised up if you use that if

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.200 
going to be raised up if you use that if
he's<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.470> squeezy<00:01:38.130> stuff<00:01:38.460> also<00:01:38.700> it's<00:01:38.970> going<00:01:39.150> to

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
he's a squeezy stuff also it's going to

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.609 
he's a squeezy stuff also it's going to
wait<00:01:39.390> it's<00:01:39.780> going<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:39.990> be<00:01:40.049> raised<00:01:40.229> up<00:01:40.380> it's<00:01:40.530> not

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
wait it's going to be raised up it's not

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.670 
wait it's going to be raised up it's not
going<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.829> be<00:01:40.920> flat<00:01:41.189> but<00:01:42.000> if<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.329> put<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:43.350> glue

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
going to be flat but if you put the glue

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.960 
going to be flat but if you put the glue
stick<00:01:43.920> on<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.250> it's<00:01:44.399> going<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.579> lay<00:01:44.700> perfectly

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
stick on it it's going to lay perfectly

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.330 
stick on it it's going to lay perfectly
flat<00:01:46.280> so<00:01:47.420> you<00:01:48.420> stick<00:01:48.630> them<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.990> pan<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:50.040> as

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
flat so you stick them to the pan and as

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.639 
flat so you stick them to the pan and as
you<00:01:50.579> can<00:01:50.759> see<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:50.939> haven't<00:01:51.270> finished<00:01:51.659> but<00:01:52.409> I

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
you can see I haven't finished but I

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.730 
you can see I haven't finished but I
just<00:01:52.950> did<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.460> pattern<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:53.970> two<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.780> then<00:01:55.470> one

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
just did a pattern of two and then one

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.920 
just did a pattern of two and then one
and<00:01:55.979> then<00:01:56.070> two<00:01:56.310> again<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.880> think<00:01:57.390> it's<00:01:57.689> really

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
and then two again I think it's really

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.569 
and then two again I think it's really
cute<00:01:58.350> it's<00:02:00.170> really<00:02:01.170> inexpensive<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:02.310> for

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
cute it's really inexpensive so for

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.250

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
this little short one I think it's

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.380

think so you can do it like that or you

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.670 
think so you can do it like that or you
can<00:02:28.400> invert<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:29.090> glass<00:02:29.200> if<00:02:30.200> you<00:02:30.290> think<00:02:30.530> it's

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
can invert the glass if you think it's

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.830

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.430 
and then you would glue an additional
one<00:05:01.669> on<00:05:01.790> the<00:05:01.880> top<00:05:02.410> for<00:05:03.410> a<00:05:03.470> handle<00:05:04.960> and<00:05:05.960> then

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
one on the top for a handle and then

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.810 
one on the top for a handle and then
whatever<00:05:06.680> you<00:05:06.979> have<00:05:07.190> underneath<00:05:09.550> would<00:05:10.550> say<00:05:10.790> I

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
whatever you have underneath would say I

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.770 
whatever you have underneath would say I
guess<00:05:11.120> fresh<00:05:11.710> and<00:05:13.150> once<00:05:14.150> it's<00:05:14.330> all<00:05:14.479> glued

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
guess fresh and once it's all glued

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.700 
guess fresh and once it's all glued
together<00:05:15.760> you<00:05:16.760> would<00:05:16.910> be<00:05:17.090> able<00:05:17.180> to<00:05:17.330> lift<00:05:17.710> the

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
together you would be able to lift the

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:24.219 
together you would be able to lift the
lid<00:05:20.830> with<00:05:21.830> you<00:05:22.100> a<00:05:22.130> little<00:05:22.780> self-made<00:05:23.780> glass

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
lid with you a little self-made glass

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:26.770 
lid with you a little self-made glass
handle<00:05:24.789> this<00:05:25.789> is<00:05:26.030> just<00:05:26.210> difficult<00:05:26.390> because

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
handle this is just difficult because

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.690 
handle this is just difficult because
they're<00:05:27.020> both<00:05:27.200> rounded<00:05:27.860> on<00:05:28.010> the<00:05:28.100> top<00:05:28.310> and<00:05:28.610> they

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
they're both rounded on the top and they

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.250 
they're both rounded on the top and they
don't<00:05:28.880> want<00:05:29.060> to<00:05:29.150> stand<00:05:29.390> without<00:05:29.780> the<00:05:30.050> glue<00:05:30.880> so

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
don't want to stand without the glue so

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.420 
don't want to stand without the glue so
