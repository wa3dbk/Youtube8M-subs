enemies with possess rocket turns this

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.509 
enemies with possess rocket turns this
is<00:00:06.480> probably<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:06.990> most<00:00:07.049> infamous<00:00:07.500> one<00:00:07.919> out<00:00:08.340> of

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
is probably the most infamous one out of

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.250 
is probably the most infamous one out of
them<00:00:08.639> all<00:00:08.790> because<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.540> rocket<00:00:09.870> turkey<00:00:10.019> must

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
them all because the rocket turkey must

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.860 
them all because the rocket turkey must
possess<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:10.950> cannot<00:00:11.429> shoot<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:12.300> broadside

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.140 
possess and cannot shoot the broadside
of<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:13.230> barn<00:00:13.259> in<00:00:13.889> fact<00:00:14.519> it<00:00:14.610> shoots<00:00:14.820> everything

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
of a barn in fact it shoots everything

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.400 
of a barn in fact it shoots everything
around<00:00:15.299> it<00:00:15.480> just<00:00:15.870> kind<00:00:16.020> of<00:00:16.049> weird

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
around it just kind of weird

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.450 
around it just kind of weird
so<00:00:16.980> my<00:00:17.880> setup<00:00:18.240> for<00:00:18.449> this<00:00:18.570> is<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:19.109> pull<00:00:19.949> everyone

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
so my setup for this is to pull everyone

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.120 
so my setup for this is to pull everyone
off<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.119> ship<00:00:21.390> into<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.960> nice<00:00:22.170> cluster<00:00:22.650> area

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
off of the ship into a nice cluster area

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.570 
off of the ship into a nice cluster area
and<00:00:23.400> then<00:00:24.769> possessed<00:00:25.769> rocket<00:00:26.250> turret<00:00:26.460> and

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
and then possessed rocket turret and

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.480 
and then possessed rocket turret and
then<00:00:26.730> warm<00:00:27.060> up<00:00:27.300> this<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.529> gonna<00:00:28.830> require<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.250> bit

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
then warm up this is gonna require a bit

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.370 
then warm up this is gonna require a bit
of<00:00:29.519> health<00:00:29.849> I<00:00:30.240> haven't<00:00:30.539> found<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.960> nice<00:00:31.170> way

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
of health I haven't found a nice way

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.560 
of health I haven't found a nice way

but what I'm gonna do understand

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.010 
but what I'm gonna do understand
position<00:01:26.590> down<00:01:26.920> here

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:44.770 

these<00:01:31.409> salts<00:01:31.950> are<00:01:42.200> grab<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.350> final<00:01:43.710> salts<00:01:44.100> I

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
these salts are grab the final salts I

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.160 
these salts are grab the final salts I
know<00:01:46.850> let's<00:01:47.850> just<00:01:48.330> throw<00:01:48.450> position<00:01:48.899> out<00:01:49.020> here

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
know let's just throw position out here

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.520 
know let's just throw position out here
hopefully

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:14.900 

I<00:01:55.350> hope<00:01:56.350> that<00:01:56.650> come<00:01:58.619> on

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:23.780 

so<00:02:15.420> my<00:02:15.990> last<00:02:16.230> position<00:02:18.410> Jase<00:02:19.410> oh<00:02:21.080> there<00:02:22.080> we<00:02:22.170> go

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
so my last position Jase oh there we go

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.180 
so my last position Jase oh there we go
like<00:02:24.790> I<00:02:24.819> said<00:02:24.940> this<00:02:25.150> one<00:02:25.330> is<00:02:25.360> I<00:02:25.950> probably<00:02:26.950> made

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
like I said this one is I probably made

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.920 
like I said this one is I probably made
it<00:02:27.310> more<00:02:27.489> difficult<00:02:27.730> than<00:02:28.120> I<00:02:28.360> thought<00:02:28.780> it

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
it more difficult than I thought it

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.559 
it more difficult than I thought it
would<00:02:29.019> be<00:02:29.730> but<00:02:30.730> you'll<00:02:30.940> definitely<00:02:31.090> need<00:02:31.420> to

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
would be but you'll definitely need to

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.210 
would be but you'll definitely need to
pull<00:02:31.780> them<00:02:31.840> off<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.290> ship<00:02:32.349> in<00:02:32.709> order<00:02:32.890> for<00:02:33.129> this

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
pull them off the ship in order for this

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.610 
pull them off the ship in order for this
thing<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:35.010> do<00:02:36.010> some<00:02:36.190> damage<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:38.470> I'm<00:02:38.530> gonna

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
thing to do some damage so I'm gonna

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.289 
thing to do some damage so I'm gonna
just<00:02:38.890> I'm<00:02:39.280> gonna<00:02:39.400> see<00:02:39.550> how<00:02:39.640> long<00:02:39.819> it<00:02:39.970> takes<00:02:40.150> for

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
just I'm gonna see how long it takes for

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.770 
just I'm gonna see how long it takes for
this<00:02:40.450> thing<00:02:40.569> to<00:02:40.750> actually<00:02:40.989> hit<00:02:41.230> its<00:02:41.650> target<00:02:42.780> so

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
this thing to actually hit its target so

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.440 
this thing to actually hit its target so
here's<00:02:44.110> a<00:02:44.200> clear<00:02:44.530> vision<00:02:44.970> target<00:02:45.970> it<00:02:46.209> still

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
here's a clear vision target it still

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.839 
here's a clear vision target it still
possessed<00:02:46.780> yeah<00:02:47.590> each<00:02:48.040> position<00:02:48.370> takes<00:02:48.670> about

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
possessed yeah each position takes about

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:54.570 
possessed yeah each position takes about
like<00:02:49.000> two<00:02:49.209> volleys<00:02:49.799> roughly<00:02:53.129> possessed<00:02:54.129> it's

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
like two volleys roughly possessed it's

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.589 
like two volleys roughly possessed it's
like<00:02:54.819> over<00:02:55.030> here<00:02:55.330> where<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.630> last<00:02:55.810> guy<00:02:55.989> is

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.190 

yeah<00:03:00.140> very<00:03:00.469> good<00:03:01.269> so<00:03:02.269> I<00:03:02.299> guess<00:03:02.480> a<00:03:02.689> strategy<00:03:03.140> you

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
yeah very good so I guess a strategy you

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.250 
yeah very good so I guess a strategy you
can<00:03:03.319> use<00:03:03.519> just<00:03:04.519> get<00:03:05.329> to<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.540> you<00:03:05.900> definitely

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
can use just get to the you definitely

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.339 
can use just get to the you definitely
still<00:03:06.409> need<00:03:06.590> undertones<00:03:07.129> pull<00:03:07.489> them<00:03:07.579> down

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
still need undertones pull them down

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:14.140 
still need undertones pull them down
definitely<00:03:09.349> use<00:03:12.219> return<00:03:13.219> sender<00:03:13.609> for<00:03:13.790> shield

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
definitely use return sender for shield
