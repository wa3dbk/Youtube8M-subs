00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.340
 zeppelin new vehicles and he 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.860
 have disappeared from the list it remains more 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.270
 that old but to fart so I know 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.550
 not if it's rockstar that makes us a 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.440
 joke or whether to unblock the 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.930
 vehicles I had heard that 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.190
 the vehicles would not necessarily 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.690
 available in robberies but hey 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.300
 so here we are with 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.860
 three poor vehicle a little farted I 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.900
 do not know if it's I do not know if it's 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.940
 servers that are not stable and 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.140
 so suddenly it changed or if it's 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.280
 rockstar who makes us a joke but 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.960
 there was still the price of 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.420
 vehicles and all that so everything leaves to 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.300
