00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.580
 Oh 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.770
 until the end 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.090
 we feel 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.540
 after 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.540
 North 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.339
 all 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.090
 m 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.090
 m 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.460
 in the key m we lived quite a lot of adventures 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.470
 when we were kids 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.420
 yeah we had a good laugh 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.950
 I looked at our anaya not long 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.690
 and it reminded me how much friends 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.409
 are important in life ah yeah and 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.270
 what does it talk about 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.530
 it's a group of six children who are going 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.909
 see their friendship break down after a 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.920
 tragic accident that happened to one 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.020
 of them is ten years later we 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.490
 finds zinta the former leader of the group who 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.360
 recluse at home still traumatized 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.130
 by the loss of his friend 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.360
 except one day my two tides appear 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.590
 in front of him and asks him to realize 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.360
 his wish to go to heaven 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.770
 and it is this event that will allow 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.450
 to the group to reconstitute itself to noah did 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.920
 it is an animal two levels of reading 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.119
 my rating is killed at the comedy with the 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.590
 different interactions between 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.759
 characters and on the other hand you have a 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.810
 more dramatic aspect that turn 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.640
 mainly around mourning 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.830
 how the relatives of a deceased live 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.530
 how does he get to go forward or 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.300
 not his skin their gay thing your drawing 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.510
 it depends on the moments 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.709
 but I really recommend you 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.090
 should really go out more often 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.040
 to stay in front of your tablets 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.019
 at your age I play superhero with 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.940
 clem in our secret bases like jinta 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.239
 and his friends had even lost tile 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.239
 cache 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:33.350
 it was the good old days here 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.670
 bursts a max later on his 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:43.299
 memories will sound like a sweet 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:45.109
 nostalgia tons you know what 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.040
 I was trying to remember where I had 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.019
 tidy my gameboy 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.930
 I wanted to go back to our gold miles 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:55.730
 I remember we read it does everything 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:59.329

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.519
