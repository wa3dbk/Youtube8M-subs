00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
trying to spread this paint and get a

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.940 
trying to spread this paint and get a
really<00:00:38.340> vibrant<00:00:38.579> image<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:41.960> so<00:00:42.960> once<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.680> get

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.369 
really vibrant image and so once I get
the<00:00:44.460> bulk<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.090> squeegeed<00:00:45.719> around<00:00:45.989> then<00:00:46.230> I

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
the bulk of it squeegeed around then I

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.020 
the bulk of it squeegeed around then I
can<00:00:46.559> start<00:00:46.829> playing<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.550> then<00:00:47.730> with<00:00:47.850> this

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
can start playing it and then with this

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.389 
can start playing it and then with this
birch<00:00:48.300> wood<00:00:48.629> it's<00:00:49.379> really<00:00:49.739> cool<00:00:49.950> if<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.129> press

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
birch wood it's really cool if you press

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.220 
birch wood it's really cool if you press
hard<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.850> can<00:00:51.000> almost<00:00:51.149> get<00:00:51.510> right<00:00:51.780> back<00:00:51.930> down

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
hard you can almost get right back down

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.000 
hard you can almost get right back down
to<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:53.430> wood<00:00:53.640> color<00:00:54.050> and<00:00:55.050> saw<00:00:55.289> coming<00:00:55.680> here

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
to the wood color and saw coming here

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.790 
to the wood color and saw coming here
and<00:00:56.449> then<00:00:57.449> once<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.899> squeegee<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.379> lot<00:00:58.559> you'll

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
and then once you squeegee a lot you'll

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.619 
and then once you squeegee a lot you'll
see<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.219> get<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.430> lot<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.820> extra<00:01:00.239> paint<00:01:00.480> on

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
see you get a lot of extra paint on

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.479 
see you get a lot of extra paint on
there<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.050> you've<00:01:01.230> got<00:01:01.469> paint<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.039> play<00:01:02.280> with

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
there so you've got paint to play with

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.880 
there so you've got paint to play with
and<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.760> can<00:01:03.359> do<00:01:03.510> small<00:01:03.690> smaller<00:01:04.439> strokes

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
and you can do small smaller strokes

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.210 
and you can do small smaller strokes
with<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.220> squeegee<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:06.000> fill-in<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.290> then

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
with the squeegee and fill-in and then

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.950 
with the squeegee and fill-in and then
this<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.640> basically<00:01:09.090> my<00:01:09.479> background<00:01:11.630> and<00:01:12.630> so

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
this is basically my background and so

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.770 
this is basically my background and so
once<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.500> do<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:13.880> you<00:01:14.880> see<00:01:15.090> how<00:01:15.210> quickly<00:01:15.540> I've

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
once I do this you see how quickly I've

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.840 
once I do this you see how quickly I've
been<00:01:15.900> covering<00:01:16.110> such<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.650> huge<00:01:17.100> area<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.580> paint

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
been covering such a huge area of paint

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.660 
been covering such a huge area of paint
it's<00:01:18.090> awesome<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.830> it's<00:01:19.830> it's<00:01:20.250> much

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
it's awesome and it's it's much

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.910 
it's awesome and it's it's much
different<00:01:20.970> than<00:01:21.270> using<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.840> brush<00:01:22.259> for<00:01:22.680> me<00:01:22.860> and

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
different than using a brush for me and

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.370 
different than using a brush for me and
so<00:01:25.920> this<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.400> squeezing<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:27.540> first<00:01:27.780> color<00:01:28.049> and

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
so this is squeezing the first color and

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.830 
so this is squeezing the first color and
I'm<00:01:28.920> gonna<00:01:29.130> see<00:01:29.820> there's<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.060> couple<00:01:30.390> spaces

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
I'm gonna see there's a couple spaces

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.929 
I'm gonna see there's a couple spaces
there<00:01:31.439> with<00:01:31.680> negative<00:01:32.100> space<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.549> might<00:01:32.729> come

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
there with negative space I might come

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.300 
there with negative space I might come
in<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.180> fill<00:01:33.420> this<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.860> might<00:01:35.100> also

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
in and fill this in and I might also

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.700 
in and fill this in and I might also
leave<00:01:35.700> some<00:01:36.390> areas<00:01:36.750> where<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.020> get<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.290> see<00:01:37.560> the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
leave some areas where I get to see the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.490 
leave some areas where I get to see the
wood<00:01:37.920> through<00:01:39.560> the<00:01:41.570> the<00:01:42.570> areas<00:01:42.930> I've<00:01:43.079> squeegee

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
wood through the the areas I've squeegee

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.950 
wood through the the areas I've squeegee
but<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.310> have<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.700> feeling<00:01:44.970> by<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.390> time<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.689> get

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
but I have a feeling by the time I get

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.179 
but I have a feeling by the time I get
done<00:01:46.110> with<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.350> painting<00:01:46.649> I'll<00:01:46.860> pretty<00:01:47.100> much

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
done with this painting I'll pretty much

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.420 
done with this painting I'll pretty much
have<00:01:47.490> covered<00:01:47.820> every<00:01:48.119> square<00:01:48.689> inch<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.229> this

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
have covered every square inch of this

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.100 
have covered every square inch of this
but<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.670> notice<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.210> less<00:01:51.420> than<00:01:51.630> 2<00:01:51.840> minutes

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
but you notice in less than 2 minutes

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.590 
but you notice in less than 2 minutes
I've<00:01:52.619> been<00:01:52.649> able<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.220> spread<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.180> red<00:01:54.390> paint

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
I've been able to spread this red paint

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.870 
I've been able to spread this red paint
all<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.110> way<00:01:55.200> across<00:01:55.439> just<00:01:55.890> by<00:01:56.040> squeezing<00:01:56.640> the

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
all the way across just by squeezing the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.450 
all the way across just by squeezing the
first<00:01:57.210> color
