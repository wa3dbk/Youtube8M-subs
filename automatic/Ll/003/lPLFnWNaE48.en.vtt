00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.750
 hello you today you carefully made 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.400
 stunning was the number that's my view well i 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.389
 I think that the audience will also be able to 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.700
 worthy to appreciate 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.700
 tell whose idea it was originally 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:32.900
 liza word that today is very similar to 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.940
 princesses and a pipe at home therefore well and how 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.930
 myself and even now there without thinking twice 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:45.140
 agreed not themselves rather like 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:50.629
 it turned out something incomprehensible - large 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:54.640
 enough besides developing there ups and 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:59.989
 drops immediately beautiful but great for 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.640
 surely something was not enough talking about the dachshund 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.489
 that the props act much 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.610
 more difficult than without him you would not go out 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.830
 and so here I am about you 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.600
 because you will be it as far as it was 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.720
 difficult how much it complicated for you 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.950
 I fulfill those elements which it was necessary 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:22.719
 easy acoustic training guitar 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:29.270
 he became much worse riding hard 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:29.930
 press down more stable well youtube 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.460
 and again this 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:37.000
 at the rehearsal my juggled weak I 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.530
 didn't shoot a bow at an apple 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.720
 such 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.619
 not so difficult it will be harder which 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.869
 element is made about takeoff and 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.759
 falls just after yours 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.280
 let's say not very successful first 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.590
 performances there was and fall like 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.170
 viewers remember you somehow 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:00.479
 changed the training schedule became more 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.479
 train and here 's something changed 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:13.630
 disappeared into small projects 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:16.720
 or I can do nothing we will achieve 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.110
 all free you after three years I 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:27.840
 lived there for 8 hours 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:31.420
 ride came later again below yet 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:36.600
 which is difficult over time so we often 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.600
 enjoyed making a number and and leaving 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:48.340
 so quickly draws go here 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:50.140
 only triggered by the disk brother 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.030
 on any changes in everything and 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.560
 all the same are assumed here is the schedule 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:03:01.410
 workouts in increase training 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:01.410

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:18.990
 let's hope that goes well 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.720

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.820

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:30.290
