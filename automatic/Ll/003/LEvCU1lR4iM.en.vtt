00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.180
 hello welcome to bmw team 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.400
 I carve out my team very much 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.680
 I'm proud to show you a few 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.890
 Things never saw much here 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.890
 fun 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.360
 next to me dieter land is the man 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.620
 has absolutely not an easy job because he 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.080
 takes care of many things 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.580
 that the whole case you get there 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.170
 and that is not easy because of the 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.670
 racing phase is not always very 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.200
 Neat, you might know me 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.110
 later why my car does not say 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.230
 stands if you still 15 years and drive 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:56.790
 Visited us then there is one there everything 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:59.250
 clear is my car service toni and the 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.520
 Wolf hiding behind 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.360
 shaky tell us a bit 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:09.479
 chief mechanic was 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:12.470
 are you nervous sometimes you disturb that 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.540
 Sometimes I'm just as nervous as you are 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.040
 I'm finally all right then 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.440
 I always try to be calm is good 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.960
 are roland talents why roland land 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.570
 because one is very famous for two 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.399
 a thing is maybe has him 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.350
 already seen the victory or the 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.690
 podest places or roland war always the 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.240
 champagne bottle of about five 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.440
 meter high from the protest I'm throwing 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.850
 I have a bottle down the 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.140
 actually are very big and very 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.119
 are heavy and he always gets the no 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.890
 that's actually the only one of the problems 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.240
 because he can do it so easily 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.240
 get with one hand 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.990
 why rolland now my job of course 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.300
 at the box stop to ten meters air 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.770
 slow and who it quite well 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.370
 works then sometime have the 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.370
 special worldcup 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.520
 service bus is here everything is going 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.780
 yes everything fits well 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.700
 The engineer is for the driver 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.430
 actually the most important man 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.170
 because you get all the information from him 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.180
 Give him a radio from the engineer 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.390
 Of course, that car too 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.760
 So win at valentino 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.880
 and I'm looking forward to 2013 myself 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.250
 also the lot so scotland but no 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.060
 speak German that's not happening 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:46.340
 Often, however, he creates the extract entirely 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.600
 good Bavarian yes like me a bit 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.930
 I have to do it a bit more 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.930
 learn 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.190
 here they are who they want to hide 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:06.069
 but that did not work 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:09.370
 Yes, without that we would certainly never 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.709
 have our cars on race weekend and 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.319
 You will notice a lot on the way on the way 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.140
 days and nights and have incredible 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.610
 also a lot of work on the race weekends 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.560
 I can not just job on the job 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.610
 learn and then wait there and just 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.590
 relax 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.620
 if they are there we have a lot too 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.790
 Much to do with tires with rims everything 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.530
 what has to do with it 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:35.459
 This could very very busy 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.459
 now there is legalization 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.430
 totti 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:49.550
 From here you will quickly through if one 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.770
 daily with a truck 90 positive in the 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.800
 always pore through completely 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:57.770
 schnitzler heart in any case we are 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.610
 yes here with the beautiful trucks soon 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.710
