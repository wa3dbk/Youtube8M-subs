easy to use and very easy to fill so

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.740 
easy to use and very easy to fill so
there<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:33.960> large<00:00:34.230> hole<00:00:34.559> on<00:00:34.920> top<00:00:35.600> that<00:00:36.600> will

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
there is a large hole on top that will

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.280 
there is a large hole on top that will
allow<00:00:37.020> these<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.559> be<00:00:37.710> filled<00:00:38.010> with<00:00:38.629> no<00:00:39.629> mess<00:00:39.930> at

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
allow these to be filled with no mess at

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.660 
allow these to be filled with no mess at
all<00:00:45.320> so<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.530> few<00:00:46.829> years<00:00:46.860> ago<00:00:47.070> there<00:00:47.520> was<00:00:47.610> a

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
all so a few years ago there was a

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.910 
all so a few years ago there was a
stigma<00:00:48.180> attached<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.510> refill<00:00:49.230> ink<00:00:49.379> cartridges

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
stigma attached to refill ink cartridges

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.369 
stigma attached to refill ink cartridges
people<00:00:50.340> thought<00:00:50.520> they<00:00:50.700> were<00:00:50.730> messy<00:00:51.390> entirely

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
people thought they were messy entirely

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.380 
people thought they were messy entirely
or<00:00:52.770> not<00:00:52.920> suitable<00:00:53.460> we<00:00:53.610> will<00:00:53.820> see<00:00:54.030> from<00:00:54.210> this

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
or not suitable we will see from this

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.229 
or not suitable we will see from this
video<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.860> manufacturers<00:00:56.550> have<00:00:56.730> come<00:00:57.000> a

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
video that the manufacturers have come a

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.840 
video that the manufacturers have come a
long<00:00:57.420> way<00:00:57.750> they're<00:00:58.530> very<00:00:58.559> easy<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.219> fail<00:00:59.609> over

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
long way they're very easy to fail over

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
long way they're very easy to fail over
and<00:01:00.120> over<00:01:00.480> again<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:01.109> they<00:01:01.350> are<00:01:01.379> not<00:01:01.710> messy<00:01:02.870> so

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
and over again and they are not messy so

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.969 
and over again and they are not messy so
we're<00:01:04.049> going<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.260> put<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.530> needle<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:04.949> the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
we're going to put the needle in the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.190 
we're going to put the needle in the
hole<00:01:05.220> here<00:01:05.700> we're<00:01:06.119> going<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.330> tilt<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:07.080> an

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
hole here we're going to tilt it an

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.830 
hole here we're going to tilt it an
angle<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:08.490> when<00:01:08.640> they<00:01:08.729> tilted<00:01:09.150> at<00:01:09.330> an<00:01:09.390> angle<00:01:09.510> so

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
angle so when they tilted at an angle so

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.820 
angle so when they tilted at an angle so
you<00:01:09.900> can<00:01:10.020> see<00:01:11.119> the<00:01:12.119> sponge<00:01:12.479> soaking<00:01:13.229> up<00:01:13.560> the

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
you can see the sponge soaking up the

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.609 
you can see the sponge soaking up the
ink<00:01:16.820> managed<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.970> get<00:01:18.090> 10<00:01:18.390> mil<00:01:18.570> up<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.320> far

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
ink managed to get 10 mil up in so far

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.200 
ink managed to get 10 mil up in so far
we're<00:01:20.040> just<00:01:20.189> going<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.400> hold<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.820> at<00:01:20.939> an<00:01:21.090> angle

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
we're just going to hold it at an angle

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.749 
we're just going to hold it at an angle
so<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:22.470> will<00:01:22.590> see<00:01:22.770> an<00:01:22.890> orange<00:01:23.189> cap<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:23.640> the

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
so you will see an orange cap on the

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.179 
so you will see an orange cap on the
bottom<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.119> this<00:01:24.270> cartridge<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:25.950> very

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
caps for future refills you've got two

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.590 
caps for future refills you've got two
ways<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.650> doing<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.820> can<00:01:33.030> either<00:01:33.210> leave

ways of doing it you can either leave

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.179 
ways of doing it you can either leave
them<00:01:33.750> in<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.960> printer<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.619> fill<00:01:34.860> from<00:01:35.070> the

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
them in the printer and fill from the

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.330 
them in the printer and fill from the
top<00:01:35.430> if<00:01:36.060> you've<00:01:36.240> got<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> steady<00:01:36.780> hand<00:01:37.250> or<00:01:38.250> you

top if you've got a steady hand or you

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.920 
top if you've got a steady hand or you
can<00:01:38.520> remove<00:01:38.820> them<00:01:39.030> from<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.329> printer<00:01:39.570> and

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
can remove them from the printer and

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.560 
can remove them from the printer and
fill<00:01:40.170> them<00:01:40.320> up<00:01:40.409> like<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.670> if<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.000> remove<00:01:42.329> them

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
fill them up like so if you remove them

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.139 
fill them up like so if you remove them
from<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.869> printer<00:01:43.369> you<00:01:44.369> will<00:01:44.490> need<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.939> put

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
from the printer you will need to put

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.410 
from the printer you will need to put
the<00:01:45.329> orange<00:01:45.659> caps<00:01:45.990> back<00:01:46.770> up<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.939> will<00:01:48.180> avoid

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
the orange caps back up this will avoid

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.899 
the orange caps back up this will avoid
any<00:01:48.869> ink<00:01:49.520> spilling<00:01:50.520> out<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.360> cartridge<00:01:52.909> so

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
any ink spilling out of the cartridge so

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.480 
any ink spilling out of the cartridge so
the<00:01:54.899> sponge<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.320> now<00:01:55.500> for<00:01:55.890> we're<00:01:56.159> just<00:01:56.310> going

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
the sponge is now for we're just going

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.880 
the sponge is now for we're just going
to<00:01:56.549> top<00:01:56.729> up<00:01:56.909> this<00:01:57.110> side<00:01:58.110> reservoir<00:01:58.770> and<00:02:00.890> we've

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
to top up this side reservoir and we've

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.209 
to top up this side reservoir and we've
got<00:02:02.100> approximately<00:02:02.329> 60<00:02:03.329> ml<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.659> ink<00:02:03.920> into<00:02:04.920> that

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
got approximately 60 ml of ink into that

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.300 
got approximately 60 ml of ink into that
cartridge<00:02:05.700> which<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.469> more<00:02:07.469> than<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.860> OEM

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
cartridge which is more than the OEM

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.720 
cartridge which is more than the OEM
cartridge<00:02:09.000> itself<00:02:09.890> as<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:11.009> can<00:02:11.250> see

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.680 
very clean it's not messy really simple
to<00:02:15.209> use<00:02:15.920> so<00:02:16.920> they<00:02:16.950> do<00:02:17.430> come<00:02:17.459> with<00:02:18.420> auto-reset

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
to use so they do come with auto-reset

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.199 
to use so they do come with auto-reset
chips<00:02:19.349> as<00:02:19.860> we've<00:02:20.069> said<00:02:20.370> on<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.480> cartridge

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
chips as we've said on the cartridge

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.309 
chips as we've said on the cartridge
basically<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.420> ink<00:02:24.629> levels<00:02:24.959> will<00:02:25.170> be

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
basically the ink levels will be

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.479 
basically the ink levels will be
monitored<00:02:25.799> as<00:02:26.250> normal<00:02:26.849> through<00:02:27.810> your<00:02:27.989> printer

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
monitored as normal through your printer

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.949 
monitored as normal through your printer
being<00:02:29.489> levels<00:02:29.849> will<00:02:30.000> go<00:02:30.180> down<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:30.840> will

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
being levels will go down and it will

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.640 
being levels will go down and it will
tell<00:02:31.170> you<00:02:31.319> that<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.620> cartridge<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.220> empty

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
tell you that the cartridge is empty

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.500 
tell you that the cartridge is empty
if<00:02:34.650> you<00:02:34.890> switch<00:02:35.370> your<00:02:35.610> printer<00:02:36.000> off<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.420> back

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
if you switch your printer off and back

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.199 
if you switch your printer off and back
on<00:02:37.470> again

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
on again

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.240 
on again
they<00:02:39.209> will<00:02:39.450> reset<00:02:39.870> themselves<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.799> a<00:02:40.829> hundred

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
they will reset themselves to a hundred

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.300 
they will reset themselves to a hundred
percent<00:02:42.110> regardless<00:02:43.110> of<00:02:43.349> the<00:02:43.560> level<00:02:43.860> of<00:02:43.980> ink

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
percent regardless of the level of ink

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.650 
percent regardless of the level of ink
in<00:02:44.549> the<00:02:44.940> printer<00:02:45.680> so<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.739> can<00:02:47.010> either<00:02:47.660> remove

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
in the printer so you can either remove

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.780 
in the printer so you can either remove
the<00:02:48.810> cartridge<00:02:49.379> every<00:02:49.650> few<00:02:49.859> days<00:02:50.069> or<00:02:50.430> once<00:02:50.640> a

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
the cartridge every few days or once a

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.750 
the cartridge every few days or once a
week<00:02:51.000> it<00:02:51.299> depends<00:02:51.629> how<00:02:51.840> often<00:02:52.200> you<00:02:52.319> use<00:02:52.349> it

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
week it depends how often you use it

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.979 
week it depends how often you use it
just<00:02:53.760> have<00:02:53.940> a<00:02:53.970> quick<00:02:54.239> look<00:02:54.420> in<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.780> side

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
just have a quick look in the side

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.089 
just have a quick look in the side
reservoir<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:56.370> then<00:02:56.489> top<00:02:56.790> it<00:02:56.819> up<00:02:57.950> if<00:02:58.950> you

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
reservoir and then top it up if you

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.650 
reservoir and then top it up if you
remove<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.579> cartridge<00:03:00.030> and<00:03:00.180> fill<00:03:00.390> it<00:03:00.510> all

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
remove the cartridge and fill it all

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.770 
remove the cartridge and fill it all
they<00:03:01.049> will<00:03:01.290> rethink<00:03:01.530> themselves<00:03:02.370> but<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.750> a

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
they will rethink themselves but to a

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.930 
they will rethink themselves but to a
hundred<00:03:04.379> percent<00:03:07.220> so<00:03:08.220> because<00:03:08.609> these<00:03:08.730> are

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
hundred percent so because these are

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.130 
hundred percent so because these are
very<00:03:09.120> clean<00:03:09.510> very<00:03:09.810> easy<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.829> use<00:03:11.269> it<00:03:12.269> does<00:03:12.930> make

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
very clean very easy to use it does make

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.960 
very clean very easy to use it does make
them<00:03:13.319> suitable<00:03:13.590> for<00:03:14.959> the<00:03:15.959> home<00:03:16.169> the<00:03:16.769> office

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
them suitable for the home the office

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.520 
them suitable for the home the office
the<00:03:17.970> photographers<00:03:18.660> and<00:03:18.989> many<00:03:19.260> other

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
the photographers and many other

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.319 
the photographers and many other
environments<00:03:22.250> so<00:03:23.250> again<00:03:23.549> it's<00:03:23.790> just<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.120> case

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
environments so again it's just a case

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:29.690 
environments so again it's just a case
of<00:03:24.359> remembering<00:03:25.139> to<00:03:27.889> to<00:03:28.889> tell<00:03:29.099> the<00:03:29.220> cartridge

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
of remembering to to tell the cartridge

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.870 
of remembering to to tell the cartridge
on<00:03:29.819> its<00:03:30.000> side<00:03:30.209> -<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.690> sponge<00:03:31.880> can't

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
on its side - the sponge can't

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.740 
on its side - the sponge can't
completely<00:03:33.950> soaked<00:03:34.950> all<00:03:35.250> so<00:03:36.120> once<00:03:36.299> it<00:03:36.480> once

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
completely soaked all so once it once

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.650 
completely soaked all so once it once
this<00:03:36.900> has<00:03:37.049> been<00:03:37.260> done<00:03:37.470> once<00:03:38.269> you<00:03:39.269> won't<00:03:39.480> need

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
this has been done once you won't need

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.599 
this has been done once you won't need
to<00:03:39.930> tell<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.349> cartridge<00:03:40.769> on<00:03:40.919> inside<00:03:41.280> for

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
to tell the cartridge on inside for

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:45.170 
to tell the cartridge on inside for
future<00:03:42.120> refills<00:03:43.519> basically<00:03:44.519> this<00:03:44.700> ones<00:03:44.940> will

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
future refills basically this ones will

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.819 
future refills basically this ones will
just<00:03:45.560> soak<00:03:46.560> it<00:03:46.769> up<00:03:46.889> as<00:03:47.099> normal<00:03:48.440> we've<00:03:49.440> managed

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
just soak it up as normal we've managed

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.740 
just soak it up as normal we've managed
to<00:03:49.859> do<00:03:50.040> that<00:03:50.250> one<00:03:50.430> now<00:03:51.180> we're<00:03:51.299> going<00:03:51.450> to<00:03:51.510> top<00:03:51.720> it

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
to do that one now we're going to top it

00:03:51.750 --> 00:04:00.400 
to do that one now we're going to top it
up<00:03:51.989> again

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.970 

so<00:04:00.920> this<00:04:01.520> is<00:04:01.670> part<00:04:01.970> of<00:04:02.060> the<00:04:02.210> sixth<00:04:02.630> up

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
so this is part of the sixth up

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:11.170 
so this is part of the sixth up
cartridge<00:04:03.980> for<00:04:04.280> the<00:04:04.430> IP<00:04:06.040> 6600<00:04:07.040> D<00:04:08.110> 6700<00:04:09.110> D<00:04:10.180> for

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
cartridge for the IP 6600 D 6700 D for

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.520 
cartridge for the IP 6600 D 6700 D for
the<00:04:11.270> common<00:04:11.690> range<00:04:12.410> of<00:04:12.650> printers<00:04:14.170> we<00:04:15.170> just<00:04:15.350> put

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
the common range of printers we just put

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.910 
the common range of printers we just put
this<00:04:15.650> plug<00:04:15.950> bucket<00:04:16.430> and<00:04:17.420> that<00:04:17.780> once<00:04:18.020> finished

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.790 

so<00:04:21.920> do<00:04:22.160> make<00:04:22.370> sure<00:04:22.430> that<00:04:22.670> the<00:04:23.000> plugs<00:04:23.300> are

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
so do make sure that the plugs are

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.400 
so do make sure that the plugs are
actually<00:04:24.800> pushed<00:04:25.130> firmly<00:04:25.750> all<00:04:26.750> the<00:04:26.990> way<00:04:27.110> down

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
actually pushed firmly all the way down

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:35.260 
actually pushed firmly all the way down
and<00:04:27.770> flush<00:04:32.650> so<00:04:33.650> in<00:04:33.770> true<00:04:33.980> TV<00:04:34.280> style<00:04:34.730> we'll<00:04:35.150> have

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
and flush so in true TV style we'll have

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.170 
and flush so in true TV style we'll have
some<00:04:35.510> of<00:04:35.540> the<00:04:35.770> we're<00:04:36.770> already<00:04:36.950> prefilled<00:04:37.550> to

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
some of the we're already prefilled to

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.900 
some of the we're already prefilled to
cut<00:04:38.420> down<00:04:38.630> on<00:04:39.500> the<00:04:39.680> video<00:04:39.950> time<00:04:40.340> so<00:04:40.610> I<00:04:40.670> have<00:04:40.880> a

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
cut down on the video time so I have a

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.330 
cut down on the video time so I have a
set<00:04:41.210> of<00:04:41.330> six<00:04:41.660> now<00:04:41.930> for<00:04:42.890> the<00:04:42.980> RP<00:04:43.420> 6600<00:04:44.500> d6<00:04:45.500> 700d

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
set of six now for the RP 6600 d6 700d
