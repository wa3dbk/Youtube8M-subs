looking<00:02:37.440> good<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:37.980> northern<00:02:38.510> everything

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
looking good and northern everything

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.830 
looking good and northern everything
looking<00:02:39.930> good<00:02:40.460> just<00:02:41.460> turn<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:42.420> heat<00:02:42.540> down<00:02:42.600> a

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
looking good just turn the heat down a

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.200 
looking good just turn the heat down a
little<00:02:43.050> more<00:02:43.260> there<00:02:43.650> but<00:02:43.860> some<00:02:44.460> more<00:02:44.550> I<00:02:44.610> use

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
little more there but some more I use

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.470 
little more there but some more I use
apple<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:46.250> hickory<00:02:47.250> together<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:48.000> the

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
apple and hickory together and the

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.090 
apple and hickory together and the
reason<00:02:48.630> I<00:02:48.840> do<00:02:48.900> that<00:02:49.020> is<00:02:49.230> because<00:02:49.410> if<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:49.800> just

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
reason I do that is because if you just

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.560 
reason I do that is because if you just
straight<00:02:50.400> Hickory<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:50.910> you<00:02:51.000> smoke<00:02:51.300> a<00:02:51.330> long

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
straight Hickory and you smoke a long

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.420 
straight Hickory and you smoke a long
time<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:52.380> can<00:02:52.470> get<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.620> little<00:02:52.860> bitter<00:02:53.100> taste

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
time you can get a little bitter taste

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.970 
time you can get a little bitter taste
but<00:02:53.640> this<00:02:53.820> way<00:02:54.030> we<00:02:54.870> use<00:02:55.050> a<00:02:55.110> combination<00:02:55.410> of<00:02:55.890> the

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
but this way we use a combination of the

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.280 
but this way we use a combination of the
both<00:02:56.130> works<00:02:56.820> good<00:02:57.090> just<00:02:57.420> put<00:02:57.630> new<00:02:57.780> wood<00:02:57.990> chips
