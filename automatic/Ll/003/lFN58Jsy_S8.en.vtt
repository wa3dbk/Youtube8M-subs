00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.109 
has great info but anyway I'm gonna put
a<00:01:43.380> building<00:01:43.649> flat<00:01:44.009> on<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.430> back<00:01:44.610> back<00:01:44.850> there

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
a building flat on the back back there

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.740 
a building flat on the back back there
cement<00:01:46.020> plant<00:01:46.259> here<00:01:46.670> the<00:01:47.670> unloading<00:01:48.360> facility

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
cement plant here the unloading facility

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.499 
cement plant here the unloading facility
here<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.170> then<00:01:49.320> on<00:01:49.439> this<00:01:49.680> track<00:01:50.070> right<00:01:50.280> here

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
here and then on this track right here

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.840 
here and then on this track right here
I'm<00:01:51.509> going<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.869> add<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.409> sand<00:01:53.009> unloader<00:01:53.670> and

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
I'm going to add the sand unloader and

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.240 
I'm going to add the sand unloader and
then<00:01:54.119> probably<00:01:54.439> have<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.470> little<00:01:55.710> bit<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:56.009> sand

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
then probably have a little bit of sand

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.810 
then probably have a little bit of sand
piles<00:01:56.640> here<00:01:57.119> or<00:01:57.990> back<00:01:58.890> there<00:01:59.219> haven't<00:01:59.549> exactly

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
piles here or back there haven't exactly

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.149 
piles here or back there haven't exactly
decided<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.630> part<00:02:00.899> out<00:02:01.049> most<00:02:01.439> likely<00:02:01.680> it'll

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
decided that part out most likely it'll

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.160 
decided that part out most likely it'll
actually<00:02:02.399> be<00:02:02.729> back<00:02:03.000> here<00:02:03.329> I'm<00:02:03.540> behind<00:02:04.020> the

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
actually be back here I'm behind the

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.600 
actually be back here I'm behind the
building<00:02:04.439> will<00:02:04.560> be<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.799> sand<00:02:05.040> pile<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.460> was

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
building will be the sand pile and was

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.389 
building will be the sand pile and was
poking<00:02:06.030> there<00:02:06.180> about<00:02:06.450> over<00:02:06.899> this<00:02:07.229> track<00:02:07.560> here

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
poking there about over this track here

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.520 
poking there about over this track here
back<00:02:09.119> here<00:02:09.330> where<00:02:09.569> were<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.959> trucks<00:02:10.259> and

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
back here where were the trucks and

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.309 
back here where were the trucks and
stuff

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
stuff

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.179 
stuff
unload<00:02:12.219> and<00:02:12.579> as<00:02:13.450> you<00:02:13.629> see<00:02:13.810> it's<00:02:13.930> really<00:02:14.170> now<00:02:14.319> so

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:15.189 
unload and as you see it's really now so

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:17.250 
unload and as you see it's really now so
that's<00:02:15.370> why<00:02:15.489> we're<00:02:15.909> but<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.659> flat<00:02:16.930> building

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
that's why we're but the flat building

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.839 
that's why we're but the flat building
there<00:02:17.379> just<00:02:17.650> to<00:02:17.739> give<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:17.920> little<00:02:18.099> more<00:02:18.219> scenes

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
there just to give a little more scenes

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.800 
there just to give a little more scenes
or<00:02:19.060> space<00:02:20.099> plant<00:02:21.099> driveway<00:02:21.969> in<00:02:22.209> will<00:02:22.390> be<00:02:22.510> right

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
or space plant driveway in will be right

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.380 
or space plant driveway in will be right
here<00:02:23.079> and<00:02:23.170> that<00:02:23.290> will<00:02:23.349> go<00:02:23.500> across<00:02:23.709> here<00:02:24.390> so

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
here and that will go across here so

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.479 
here and that will go across here so
we'll<00:02:25.510> have<00:02:25.629> to<00:02:25.810> add<00:02:25.959> some<00:02:26.290> let<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.310> road

we'll have to add some let the road

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.899 
we'll have to add some let the road
through<00:02:28.120> here<00:02:28.480> to<00:02:28.930> get<00:02:29.079> into<00:02:29.319> the<00:02:29.379> plant

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
through here to get into the plant

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.160

parking lots back there where there will

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.440 
parking lots back there where there will
be<00:02:32.200> a<00:02:32.590> few<00:02:32.890> spots<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.370> unload<00:02:33.670> at<00:02:34.000> us<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.269> bays

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
to the sand pile back there and the rock

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.209 
to the sand pile back there and the rock
pile<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.780> in<00:02:41.260> through<00:02:41.530> here<00:02:41.680> we'll<00:02:41.799> just<00:02:41.859> kind

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:42.219 
pile and in through here we'll just kind

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:44.220 
pile and in through here we'll just kind
of<00:02:42.250> be<00:02:42.370> like<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.549> dead<00:02:43.030> space<00:02:43.329> maybe<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.900> fence

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
of be like a dead space maybe a fence

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.619 
of be like a dead space maybe a fence
around<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:45.069> facility<00:02:45.549> most<00:02:46.060> likely<00:02:46.420> that<00:02:46.540> we

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
around the facility most likely that we

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.179 
around the facility most likely that we
have<00:02:46.720> fence<00:02:46.930> around<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.319> facility<00:02:47.799> yeah

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:48.189 
have fence around the facility yeah

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:50.280 
have fence around the facility yeah
that's<00:02:48.609> how<00:02:49.209> we're<00:02:49.329> gonna<00:02:49.389> lay<00:02:49.599> it<00:02:49.720> out<00:02:49.810> so

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
that's how we're gonna lay it out so

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.050 
that's how we're gonna lay it out so
today's<00:02:50.560> video<00:02:50.739> is<00:02:50.919> short<00:02:51.310> quick<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:52.030> the

money and that's just a little tip for

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.399 
money and that's just a little tip for
me<00:03:00.609> I<00:03:00.819> know<00:03:01.299> this<00:03:01.569> video<00:03:01.989> problem<00:03:02.290> was<00:03:02.379> that

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:02.409 
me I know this video problem was that

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.039 
me I know this video problem was that
informative<00:03:02.980> but<00:03:03.430> it's<00:03:03.849> a<00:03:03.970> major<00:03:04.150> part<00:03:04.450> of<00:03:04.689> how

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
informative but it's a major part of how

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.750 
informative but it's a major part of how
I<00:03:05.079> lay<00:03:05.260> out<00:03:05.379> my<00:03:05.530> layout<00:03:05.829> so<00:03:06.099> I<00:03:06.129> figured<00:03:06.459> you

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
I lay out my layout so I figured you

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.059 
I lay out my layout so I figured you
might<00:03:07.090> get<00:03:07.329> something<00:03:07.540> out<00:03:07.720> of<00:03:07.780> it<00:03:07.959> so<00:03:08.560> as

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
might get something out of it so as
