I'm<00:00:04.100> reconstructing<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:05.220> Hendrix<00:00:05.580> project

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029

I'm reconstructing the Hendrix project
which<00:00:06.180> was<00:00:06.359> made<00:00:06.540> in<00:00:06.690> 1991<00:00:07.350> Rigby<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.189> Miller

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
company the answers for this

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.709 
company the answers for this
reconstruction<00:00:14.490> we're<00:00:14.730> calling<00:00:15.089> it<00:00:15.240> Hendrix

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
reconstruction we're calling it Hendrix

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.900 
reconstruction we're calling it Hendrix
redux<00:00:16.880> so<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:17.970> has<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.150> whole<00:00:18.359> new<00:00:18.600> identity

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
redux so it has a whole new identity

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.849 
redux so it has a whole new identity
reconstruction<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.090> very<00:00:21.570> funny<00:00:22.109> thing<00:00:22.260> I

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
reconstruction is a very funny thing I

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.009 
reconstruction is a very funny thing I
was<00:00:23.789> there<00:00:23.939> at<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.090> beginning<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.720> now<00:00:24.810> I'm

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
was there at the beginning and now I'm

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.109 
was there at the beginning and now I'm
here<00:00:25.380> 20<00:00:25.890> odd<00:00:26.039> years<00:00:26.070> later<00:00:26.580> with<00:00:26.849> another

cast<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:29.630> was<00:00:30.630> mostly<00:00:30.990> interested<00:00:31.260> in<00:00:31.710> how<00:00:32.550> can

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
cast I was mostly interested in how can

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.920 
cast I was mostly interested in how can
I<00:00:32.910> make<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.210> work<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:34.230> somehow<00:00:34.469> reflects<00:00:35.130> a

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
I make a work that somehow reflects a

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.420 
I make a work that somehow reflects a
particular<00:00:36.930> sense<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.410> community<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.219> being

I'm<00:00:55.980> creating<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.489> piece<00:00:56.699> I'm<00:00:57.149> working<00:00:57.719> really

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
I'm creating a piece I'm working really

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.520 
I'm creating a piece I'm working really
intimately<00:00:59.070> with<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.969> group<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.750> friends<00:01:01.079> and

intimately with a group of friends and

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.250 
intimately with a group of friends and
collaborators<00:01:02.280> for<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.329> dancers<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:03.989> time

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
collaborators for the dancers this time

it's<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.850> very<00:01:05.850> complex<00:01:07.520> puzzle<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.700> solve

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
it's this very complex puzzle to solve

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.940 
it's this very complex puzzle to solve
not<00:01:09.180> only<00:01:09.540> where<00:01:09.780> do<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:09.990> put<00:01:10.260> where<00:01:10.770> do<00:01:10.830> they

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
not only where do you put where do they

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.270 
not only where do you put where do they
put<00:01:11.130> their<00:01:11.250> own<00:01:11.280> bodies<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.240> space<00:01:12.510> in<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.830> the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
put their own bodies in space in in the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.820 
put their own bodies in space in in the
dance<00:01:14.490> but<00:01:15.180> how<00:01:15.360> do<00:01:15.420> they<00:01:15.659> infuse<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.680> with

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
dance but how do they infuse it with

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.219 
dance but how do they infuse it with
somebody<00:01:17.100> else's<00:01:17.580> logic<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.420> then<00:01:18.960> make<00:01:19.200> it

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
somebody else's logic and then make it

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.109 
somebody else's logic and then make it
their<00:01:19.500> own<00:01:19.680> at<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.979> same<00:01:20.159> time<00:01:20.369> it's<00:01:20.970> a

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
their own at the same time it's a

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.820 
their own at the same time it's a
wonderful<00:01:21.600> complexity<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.439> think<00:01:22.710> is

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
wonderful complexity that I think is

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.100 
wonderful complexity that I think is
really<00:01:23.009> at<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.340> heart<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.850> what<00:01:24.600> we<00:01:24.750> do<00:01:24.930> in

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
really at the heart of what we do in

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.490 
really at the heart of what we do in
this<00:01:25.229> field<00:01:25.790> as<00:01:26.790> dance<00:01:27.180> artists<00:01:27.780> when<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.259> say

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
this field as dance artists when I say

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.469 
this field as dance artists when I say
that<00:01:28.740> Jimmy<00:01:28.979> came<00:01:29.220> along<00:01:29.490> for<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.820> ride<00:01:30.000> it

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
that Jimmy came along for the ride it

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.800 
that Jimmy came along for the ride it
was<00:01:30.810> almost<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.890> representative

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
was almost a representative

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.330 
was almost a representative
representation<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.930> someone<00:01:34.530> some<00:01:34.920> kind<00:01:35.220> of

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
representation of someone some kind of

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.620 
representation of someone some kind of
community<00:01:35.790> or<00:01:36.000> some<00:01:36.210> kind<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.689> leader<00:01:37.619> that

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
community or some kind of a leader that

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.630 
community or some kind of a leader that
Jimmy<00:01:39.630> fit<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.960> bill

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
Jimmy fit the bill

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.480 
Jimmy fit the bill
the<00:01:40.790> music<00:01:41.120> was<00:01:41.240> pretty<00:01:41.510> cool

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.130 

I<00:01:46.549> was<00:01:47.240> here<00:01:47.479> is<00:01:47.720> a<00:01:47.750> grad<00:01:48.320> student<00:01:48.770> in<00:01:49.040> the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
I was here is a grad student in the

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.550 
I was here is a grad student in the
1970s<00:01:51.140> I<00:01:51.409> think<00:01:52.070> that<00:01:52.250> that<00:01:52.460> experience

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
1970s I think that that experience

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.859 
1970s I think that that experience
mainly<00:01:54.560> gave<00:01:54.830> me<00:01:55.009> a<00:01:55.040> sense<00:01:55.369> of<00:01:55.520> context<00:01:56.240> I<00:01:56.479> came

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
mainly gave me a sense of context I came

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.380 
mainly gave me a sense of context I came
in<00:01:57.080> knowing<00:01:57.799> my<00:01:58.250> own<00:01:58.280> background<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:59.149> dance

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
in knowing my own background and dance

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.260 
in knowing my own background and dance
and<00:01:59.810> I<00:02:00.229> felt<00:02:00.890> I<00:02:01.070> figured<00:02:01.670> out<00:02:01.729> how<00:02:01.880> to<00:02:01.909> place

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
and I felt I figured out how to place

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.380 
and I felt I figured out how to place
myself<00:02:02.750> on<00:02:02.840> a<00:02:02.869> timeline<00:02:03.350> or<00:02:04.390> contextual

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
myself on a timeline or contextual

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.999 
myself on a timeline or contextual
background<00:02:06.170> with<00:02:06.409> lots<00:02:06.679> of<00:02:06.770> other<00:02:06.950> things

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
background with lots of other things

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.100 
background with lots of other things
that<00:02:07.250> are<00:02:07.369> going<00:02:07.610> on<00:02:07.850> you<00:02:08.750> know<00:02:08.840> all<00:02:08.989> that

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
that are going on you know all that

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.530 
that are going on you know all that
happened<00:02:09.560> and<00:02:09.679> you<00:02:09.800> file<00:02:10.069> it<00:02:10.250> away<00:02:10.459> and<00:02:10.880> 20

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
happened and you file it away and 20

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.570 
happened and you file it away and 20
years<00:02:11.780> later<00:02:12.080> when<00:02:12.739> I'm<00:02:12.860> making<00:02:13.190> this<00:02:13.340> piece

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
years later when I'm making this piece

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.130 
years later when I'm making this piece
the<00:02:14.510> idea<00:02:14.870> that<00:02:15.260> oh<00:02:16.120> okay<00:02:17.120> I<00:02:17.150> can<00:02:17.540> make<00:02:17.660> a<00:02:17.720> dance

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.100 
the idea that oh okay I can make a dance
work<00:02:18.500> but<00:02:18.769> I<00:02:18.799> can<00:02:19.130> also<00:02:19.370> build<00:02:19.819> a<00:02:20.060> context<00:02:20.870> and

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
work but I can also build a context and

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.809 
work but I can also build a context and
maybe<00:02:21.500> I<00:02:21.620> build<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:21.920> context<00:02:22.310> before<00:02:22.670> the

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
maybe I build the context before the

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.240 
maybe I build the context before the
dance<00:02:23.030> work<00:02:23.330> so<00:02:23.959> that's<00:02:24.170> directly<00:02:24.709> related<00:02:25.220> to

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
dance work so that's directly related to

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.509 
dance work so that's directly related to
what<00:02:25.459> I<00:02:25.489> learned<00:02:25.850> here<00:02:26.030> as<00:02:26.150> a<00:02:26.180> student<00:02:27.519> it's

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
what I learned here as a student it's

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.449 
what I learned here as a student it's
not<00:02:28.760> just<00:02:29.239> about<00:02:29.690> what<00:02:30.560> how<00:02:31.040> do<00:02:31.100> I<00:02:31.190> feel<00:02:31.340> like

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
not just about what how do I feel like

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.910 
not just about what how do I feel like
moving<00:02:31.819> today<00:02:32.030> or<00:02:32.630> what's<00:02:32.900> a<00:02:33.049> listening<00:02:33.830> to

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
moving today or what's a listening to

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.590 
moving today or what's a listening to
music<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:34.430> putting<00:02:34.730> it<00:02:34.880> all<00:02:34.970> together<00:02:35.120> but

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
music and putting it all together but

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.890 
music and putting it all together but
but<00:02:36.170> here's<00:02:36.350> an<00:02:36.500> opportunity<00:02:36.709> to<00:02:37.580> to<00:02:38.480> figure

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
but here's an opportunity to to figure

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.890 
but here's an opportunity to to figure
out<00:02:39.080> of<00:02:39.260> an<00:02:39.739> intersection<00:02:40.549> of<00:02:40.910> idea<00:02:41.830> movement

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
out of an intersection of idea movement

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.170 
out of an intersection of idea movement
potential<00:02:44.900> something<00:02:45.860> at<00:02:45.950> making<00:02:46.880> something

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
potential something at making something

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.710 
potential something at making something
it<00:02:47.269> wasn't<00:02:47.599> there<00:02:47.750> before<00:02:47.860> so<00:02:48.860> all<00:02:49.069> of<00:02:49.310> that

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
it wasn't there before so all of that

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.630 
it wasn't there before so all of that
feels<00:02:50.720> lodged<00:02:50.989> in<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.530> process<00:02:52.040> somehow

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
feels lodged in the process somehow

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.040 
feels lodged in the process somehow
right<00:02:53.239> I'm<00:02:54.200> really<00:02:54.500> grateful<00:02:54.739> that<00:02:54.950> I<00:02:56.019> was

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
right I'm really grateful that I was

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.960 
right I'm really grateful that I was
and<00:02:59.050> I<00:02:59.200> would<00:02:59.380> I<00:02:59.470> listen<00:02:59.680> to<00:02:59.890> what<00:03:00.250> I<00:03:00.310> was<00:03:00.580> was

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
and I would I listen to what I was was

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.320 
and I would I listen to what I was was
learning<00:03:02.340> you<00:03:03.340> take<00:03:03.520> it<00:03:03.640> away<00:03:03.730> you<00:03:03.880> never<00:03:04.180> know

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
learning you take it away you never know

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.110 
learning you take it away you never know
where<00:03:04.480> it's<00:03:04.570> gonna<00:03:04.660> service
