00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
who knows but I just try and grasp the

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.069 
who knows but I just try and grasp the
opportunity<00:03:27.159> if<00:03:27.579> one<00:03:27.790> arises<00:03:28.239> well<00:03:28.810> certainly

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
opportunity if one arises well certainly

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.379 
opportunity if one arises well certainly
a<00:03:29.260> great<00:03:29.769> step<00:03:30.129> forward<00:03:30.459> anyway<00:03:30.849> to<00:03:30.909> follow<00:03:31.239> in

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:31.389 
a great step forward anyway to follow in
