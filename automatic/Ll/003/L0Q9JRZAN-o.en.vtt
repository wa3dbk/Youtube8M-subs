in a massive difference
it's<00:04:27.750> better<00:04:27.990> than<00:04:28.140> using<00:04:28.320> a<00:04:28.500> standard<00:04:28.890> barrel

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
it's better than using a standard barrel

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.950 
it's better than using a standard barrel
which<00:04:29.340> does<00:04:29.550> nothing<00:04:29.730> at<00:04:29.970> all<00:04:30.120> the

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
rangefinder attachment can also help

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.670 
rangefinder attachment can also help
with<00:04:32.910> long-range<00:04:33.210> counter<00:04:33.840> sniping<00:04:34.260> but

with long-range counter sniping but

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.260 
with long-range counter sniping but
you'll<00:04:34.830> need<00:04:34.950> to<00:04:35.100> sacrifice<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:35.820> variable

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
you'll need to sacrifice the variable

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.690 
you'll need to sacrifice the variable
zoom<00:04:36.420> for<00:04:36.690> this<00:04:36.840> the<00:04:37.410> pld<00:04:37.950> as<00:04:38.160> well<00:04:38.430> as<00:04:38.550> for

zoom for this the pld as well as for

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.310 
zoom for this the pld as well as for
spotting<00:04:39.060> targets<00:04:39.480> can<00:04:39.630> also<00:04:39.810> be<00:04:40.020> used<00:04:40.050> for

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
spotting targets can also be used for

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.380 
spotting targets can also be used for
range-finding<00:04:40.920> so<00:04:41.520> it's<00:04:41.700> probably<00:04:41.910> a<00:04:42.180> better

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
range-finding so it's probably a better

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.270 
range-finding so it's probably a better
choice<00:04:42.510> than<00:04:42.720> sacrificing<00:04:43.710> the<00:04:43.830> variable

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
choice than sacrificing the variable

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.490
