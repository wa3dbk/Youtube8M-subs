00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.759
 Hello 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.570
 Today I will show you the work of your DAC 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.350
 go menu 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:39.660
 here we adjust the clock frequency 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:42.629
 microcontroller by default stands at 75 x 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.699
 In this case, the sampling rate is 48 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:50.970
 kilohertz so everything is on the table everything 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:56.489
 matches those further here 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:58.309
 data about right is displayed 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:04.320
 is displayed 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:09.200
 byte which goes on account 3 4 5 and so 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.200
 next is the MB value 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:33.840
 255 spite clean wash 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:36.319
 completely behind the move mastercook 112 do the 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.319
 white 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:42.289
 farther 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:57.170
 here's an interesting car thing you're here 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:04.820
 device turns out automatically 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:06.820
 determines the sampling rate here and 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.820
 adjust digital filter 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.820
 automatically 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.510
 are you there sound card mode 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:29.010
 for any purpose 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:38.900
 or can it reset the parameters on 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:38.900
 diffuse this mode silence software brew 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:47.400
 version of the system we press the average 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:56.750
 medium clicking author by 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:01.300
 and the release date of the latest firmware version 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:07.270
 10 0 5 2012 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:10.600
 nothing else was released so much 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:13.430
 this is a reset of the entire system 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.750
 If anything, you can reset to return all 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:21.140
 parameters back 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:25.750
 Initially there is this mode hayn mode in 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:30.160
 In this case, it is turned on and devices 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:37.280
 after 10 seconds of inactivity suits 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:43.180
 low consumption mode is actively 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.180
 squeaker cool pressed squeaks 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.640
 this is the display off after 2 minutes 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:02.420
 mix volume control 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.420
 accustomed 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.800
 this is a press in the work of the lift chip 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.790
 I 'll show you disappear too 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.790
 audio stream 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:34.540
 but the signal and go search 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:47.890
 Now there is no signal at all since I'm from 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:59.330
 I will make out vishnu 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:05:03.130
 pasted it found the thread turned on 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.130
 the player on the computer is frozen 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:13.030
 run just hanging 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.410
 restart 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:31.220
 everything all plays here everything earned here 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:37.020
 all the same 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:45.530
 full order so works mine 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:45.530
 device force thanks for watching everyone
