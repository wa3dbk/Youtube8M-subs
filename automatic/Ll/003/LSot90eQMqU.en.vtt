00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:09.300
 games gmbh a specialist with 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.330
 fight prizes hello and cordially 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.759
 welcome here axles is again bayer 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.520
 yes and after I oodles Request 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.920
 got what it has to grow with 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.020
 this individually four tactics because on 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.210
 I thought so good people 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.199
 I'll tell mine now 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.279
 Settings I can start 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.989
 I think I have to singles here 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:37.770
 Season then go to play game yes 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.660
 probably now play this part and 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.520
 I made a video where I am 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.280
 have explained to you as you the whole 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.500
 you can adjust at all well you see 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.510
 it anyway, so you just go 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.399
 on season then here on team management 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.050
 and individual tactics will now 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.960
 I show you I have quite a lot 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.390
 different logos individually 4 is like that 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.609
 so I get along well with that 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.070
 the construction speed I have 75 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.810
 hired for as soon as i want to 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.490
 have the ball that the switching game 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.810
 between defend and attack very 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.540
 goes fast and that's just this 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.090
 setting speed then would like 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.369
 I rather look for a mixed passing game 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:25.439
 So go for a short pass and a long time 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:27.270
 passes it sees 46h and set 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.490
 it was very important to me what that 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.310
 not all pulled together 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.189
 move but are allowed to move freely 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.380
 So that makes much better 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.180
 possibilities I find and run it 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.130
 sometimes the players are so pure that 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.200
 you can surprise the opponent and 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.619
 at fifa it's very important things too 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.990
 do not expect the opponent and there 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.250
 definitely belongs to that one 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.530
 outside midfielder for example with 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.790
 in the storm moves forward and that 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.549
 here determines this free choice 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.950
 attitude in position play then at 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.780
 I have worked out the opportunities 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.579
 back to a mixed or as 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.340
 normal visor is pass game 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.049
 decided and little cross in because 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.340
 I do not like to flank myself 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.960
 find flanks are in this game 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.340
 quite 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.140
 so slim you flank in the stop 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.750
 the penalty area I think are 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.760
 not often good, of course, the one 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.260
 or other flank arrives and you 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.530
 can put in the header 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.630
 but i have the feeling that it is rather 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.540
 Rarely the case is that one flank 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.300
 or make a goal via header is 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.310
 just my personal experience because of that 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.630
 I have put on little here then 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.730
 of course, the shot behave 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.990
 a little bit more because somehow I have to 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.730
 I have my chances if I have already 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.770
 I do not want to cross that very much 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.970
 my players as often as possible in the 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.390
 Run free and yourself 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.400
 position to shoot so when 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.959
 I agree with a formation 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.690
 my attitude here are the 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.770
 Most attacks offensive players then 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.150
 very often so they can shoot well 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.080
 depending on how the enemy defends 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.090
 Of course that's clear 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.220
 and again here's free choice 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.230
 I already explained why with mine 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.600
 Defense with Michael if you can 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.340
 of course, a player he is quite 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.470
 would like to win the ball back quickly 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.459
 could I recommend you this pressure 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.670
 definitely a bit higher 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.230
 to screw on 60 to 70 so 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.330
 decides if you have the defense 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.650
 does not control how it behaves 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:25.930
 if she puts pressure on early now 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.890
 the ball-bearing opponent or whether they 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.050
 a little bit of time 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.030
 bit looser away I will have 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.739
 done so on fifty-fifty and the 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.260
 I also have a bit of aggressiveness 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.420
 less done than if you like it very much 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.700
 then it can be very fast 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.070
 happen that the defender too far 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.650
 has made pressure and aggressiveness or 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.510
 has shown aggression and then 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.920
 arise the gaps for the opponent and 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.940
 We want to avoid that 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.459
 that's why I have that a bit 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:56.950
 screwed down at 50 and pressure 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:58.060
 aggressiveness 40 and move there 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.560
 I also because I'm not exactly 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.540
 I knew what was going on there now 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.310
 I should set this to 50 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.650
 let me be honest, but so to speak 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.380
 on the whole, this individual fits 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.709
 individual tactics very good if you eg 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.150
 plays ball possession or if you are 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.590
 one is the fast back the ball 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.780
 wants to win and then as fast as 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.789
 possible to play sugar better forward 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.709
 everyone wants to do that 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:21.359
 leave 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.819
 I come with this individually four 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.169
 this magical individual for me 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:26.789
 Already often mentioned in my videos 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:30.479
 I'm real with those with whom 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:31.889
 well, clearly and well she tries on everyone 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:33.240
 fall out and you're welcome then 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.160

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.500

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.620
 one more thing in advance I have these 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.870
 Hiring done as I did then 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.669
 I regularly played 4 1 2 1 2 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.830
 of course, do not know like this now 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:49.590
 Attitude to other formations 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.770
 I can only say in the 4 1 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:55.889
 212 formations and in the 3 5 2 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.020
 formation works quite well and 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.550
 I am quite successful what 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.789
 is called right pinzl very successful 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.750
