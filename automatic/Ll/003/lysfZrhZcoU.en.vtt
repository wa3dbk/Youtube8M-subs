00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:10.610 
seasons votes starting like a month and

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.980 
seasons votes starting like a month and
you<00:00:11.610> see<00:00:11.910> their<00:00:12.059> reaction<00:00:12.509> when<00:00:12.660> you<00:00:12.690> wake<00:00:12.840> up

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990

you see their reaction when you wake up
so<00:00:13.710> we're<00:00:13.889> about<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.099> build<00:00:14.340> some<00:00:14.490> stands<00:00:14.759> for

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
so we're about to build some stands for

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.779 
so we're about to build some stands for
them<00:00:15.590> we're<00:00:16.590> going<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:16.770> show<00:00:16.920> you<00:00:16.949> away<00:00:17.369> very

them we're going to show you away very
simple<00:00:18.210> it's<00:00:18.840> just<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.080> triangular<00:00:19.650> formation

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
simple it's just a triangular formation

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.500 
simple it's just a triangular formation
on<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.750> one<00:00:21.750> bait<00:00:21.990> tree<00:00:22.230> all<00:00:23.160> right<00:00:23.369> here's<00:00:23.820> just

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
on a one bait tree all right here's just

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.750 
on a one bait tree all right here's just
some<00:00:24.570> typical<00:00:25.080> two<00:00:25.380> by<00:00:25.500> fours<00:00:25.740> eight<00:00:26.310> feet<00:00:26.580> I

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
some typical two by fours eight feet I

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.660 
some typical two by fours eight feet I
mentioned<00:00:27.500> you<00:00:28.500> guys<00:00:28.710> soon<00:00:28.949> what<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:29.369> can<00:00:29.519> see

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
mentioned you guys soon what you can see

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.530 
mentioned you guys soon what you can see
here<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.000> we<00:00:30.179> made<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.480> triangular<00:00:31.050> formation

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
here is we made the triangular formation

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.580 
here is we made the triangular formation
while<00:00:33.540> it's<00:00:34.190> at<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.370> base<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.880> tree<00:00:36.590> okay

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
while it's at the base of the tree okay

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.110 
while it's at the base of the tree okay
with<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.829> brace<00:00:38.070> going<00:00:38.430> across<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.850> front

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
with the brace going across the front

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.119 
with the brace going across the front
this<00:00:39.629> would<00:00:39.840> be<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.260> area<00:00:40.559> you're<00:00:40.739> sitting<00:00:41.040> on

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
this would be the area you're sitting on

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.819 
this would be the area you're sitting on
and<00:00:41.430> then<00:00:42.360> just<00:00:43.399> braced<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.610> on<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.850> back<00:00:45.030> end

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
and then just braced it on the back end

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.049 
and then just braced it on the back end
nailed<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:46.920> through<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.250> tip<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.700> then<00:00:47.789> put<00:00:48.030> a

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
nailed it through the tip and then put a

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.819 
nailed it through the tip and then put a
brace<00:00:48.530> we<00:00:49.530> already<00:00:49.800> put<00:00:49.980> our<00:00:51.559> supports<00:00:52.559> going

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
brace we already put our supports going

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.700 
brace we already put our supports going
downwards<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.750> then<00:00:54.750> we're<00:00:54.930> just<00:00:55.230> slide<00:00:55.590> it

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
downwards and then we're just slide it

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.590 
downwards and then we're just slide it
up<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.829> tree<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.190> hammer<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.789> all<00:00:57.420> right

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
up the tree and hammer it in all right

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.380 
up the tree and hammer it in all right
we<00:00:58.379> use<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.829> trees<00:00:59.760> that<00:00:59.969> were<00:01:00.059> laying<00:01:00.239> around

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
we use the trees that were laying around

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:13.340 
we use the trees that were laying around
for<00:01:02.300> for<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.480> steps<00:01:04.909> all<00:01:05.909> right

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.260 

okay<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.700> everybody<00:01:15.090> we're<00:01:16.020> done<00:01:16.290> our<00:01:17.270> step

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
okay so everybody we're done our step

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.450 
okay so everybody we're done our step
one<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:19.050> just<00:01:19.200> got<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.500> build<00:01:19.620> the<00:01:19.920> get<00:01:20.430> a

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
one you just got to build the get a

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.620 
one you just got to build the get a
piece<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.670> plywood<00:01:20.940> and<00:01:21.270> build<00:01:21.510> your

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
piece of plywood and build your

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.000 
piece of plywood and build your
platformer<00:01:22.260> right<00:01:22.440> so<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.220> way<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.430> looks<00:01:23.610> is

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
platformer right so the way it looks is

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.609 
platformer right so the way it looks is
again<00:01:26.010> triangle<00:01:27.000> all<00:01:27.300> we<00:01:27.540> did<00:01:27.720> from<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.440> last

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
again triangle all we did from the last

again triangle all we did from the last
step<00:01:28.830> was<00:01:29.010> slide<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.520> up<00:01:29.690> nail<00:01:30.860> we<00:01:31.860> had<00:01:31.979> already

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
step was slide it up nail we had already

step was slide it up nail we had already
put<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:33.570> nails<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.229> braces<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.759> on<00:01:36.420> the

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
put the nails of the braces and on the

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.630 
put the nails of the braces and on the
tree<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.229> on<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.860> brace<00:01:38.040> right<00:01:38.280> there

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
tree and on the brace right there

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.580 
tree and on the brace right there
we<00:01:38.880> had<00:01:39.000> already<00:01:39.240> nailed<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.570> into<00:01:39.810> 2x4<00:01:40.380> that

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
we had already nailed it into 2x4 that

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.050 
we had already nailed it into 2x4 that
we<00:01:40.710> want<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:40.950> slides<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.400> we<00:01:41.550> just<00:01:41.700> hammer<00:01:41.910> it
