00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.039 
considered a seminal of a semi hollow
body<00:01:43.759> because<00:01:44.359> there's<00:01:44.509> a<00:01:44.630> block<00:01:44.840> of<00:01:45.020> wood

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
body because there's a block of wood

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.260 
body because there's a block of wood
here<00:01:45.530> even<00:01:46.520> though<00:01:46.579> it<00:01:46.700> doesn't<00:01:46.969> touch<00:01:47.090> all
