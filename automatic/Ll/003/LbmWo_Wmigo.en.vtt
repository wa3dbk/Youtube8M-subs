00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
very dark blue and then you've got the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.660 
very dark blue and then you've got the
tenth<00:01:28.439> quarter<00:01:28.710> inch<00:01:28.799> one<00:01:29.040> which<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.369> dark

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
tenth quarter inch one which is a dark

tenth quarter inch one which is a dark
blue<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.180> then<00:01:30.659> you've<00:01:30.810> got<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.560> minimates

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
blue and then you've got the minimates

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.130 
blue and then you've got the minimates
one<00:01:32.430> which<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:33.030> lighter<00:01:33.299> blue<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.900> then<00:01:34.049> you

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
one which is a lighter blue and then you

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.140 
one which is a lighter blue and then you
got<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.470> diamond<00:01:35.400> select<00:01:35.610> one<00:01:35.820> which<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.000> a

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
got a diamond select one which is a

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.630 
got a diamond select one which is a
light<00:01:36.390> blue<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:37.229> I'm<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.770> think<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.430> more

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
light blue so I'm I think the more

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.300 
light blue so I'm I think the more
accurate<00:01:38.850> would<00:01:39.360> have<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.720> be<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.259> these<00:01:41.040> two

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
accurate would have to be the these two

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.910 
accurate would have to be the these two
maybe<00:01:42.000> even<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.540> minimates<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.470> think<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.770> it

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
maybe even the minimates I think that it

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.679 
maybe even the minimates I think that it
needs<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.220> be<00:01:44.340> just<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.610> tad<00:01:44.729> lighter<00:01:45.180> than<00:01:45.570> the

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
needs to be just a tad lighter than the

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.810 
needs to be just a tad lighter than the
same<00:01:45.869> quarter<00:01:46.200> inch<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.500> 8<00:01:46.710> inch<00:01:46.890> one<00:01:47.159> but<00:01:47.700> not

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
same quarter inch and 8 inch one but not

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.460 
same quarter inch and 8 inch one but not
too<00:01:48.060> much<00:01:48.090> lighter<00:01:48.479> because<00:01:49.020> they<00:01:49.200> pretty

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
too much lighter because they pretty

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.590 
too much lighter because they pretty
much<00:01:49.590> got<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:49.979> color<00:01:50.280> down<00:01:50.520> pretty<00:01:50.850> well<00:01:51.119> so

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
much got to color down pretty well so

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.160 
much got to color down pretty well so
yeah<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.170> then<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:52.939> has<00:01:53.939> as<00:01:54.360> for<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.720> red<00:01:54.899> the

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
yeah and then I has as for the red the

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.219 
yeah and then I has as for the red the
red<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.680> up<00:01:56.040> pretty<00:01:56.280> nicely<00:01:56.520> done<00:01:57.360> just<00:01:57.990> there

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
red is up pretty nicely done just there

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.190 
red is up pretty nicely done just there
is<00:01:58.439> what<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.070> mean<00:01:59.340> with<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.810> minimates<00:02:00.810> my<00:02:00.960> man

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
is what I mean with the minimates my man

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.749 
is what I mean with the minimates my man
the<00:02:01.350> webs<00:02:01.619> are<00:02:01.860> actually<00:02:02.189> highlighted<00:02:02.670> in

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.210 
webs are highlighted
back<00:02:06.479> as<00:02:06.810> for<00:02:07.050> the<00:02:07.080> 8<00:02:07.229> inch<00:02:07.380> into<00:02:07.650> the<00:02:07.890> quarter

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
back as for the 8 inch into the quarter

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.950 
back as for the 8 inch into the quarter
inch<00:02:08.310> they're<00:02:08.550> not<00:02:08.789> they're<00:02:09.179> just<00:02:09.420> sculpted

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
inch they're not they're just sculpted

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.650 
inch they're not they're just sculpted
on<00:02:10.080> there<00:02:10.319> so<00:02:10.590> that's<00:02:11.130> not<00:02:11.430> great<00:02:11.700> as<00:02:11.910> far<00:02:12.390> as<00:02:12.420> I

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
on there so that's not great as far as I

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.020 
on there so that's not great as far as I
color<00:02:12.990> so<00:02:13.319> would<00:02:13.470> be<00:02:13.700> minimates<00:02:14.700> one<00:02:14.880> you've

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
color so would be minimates one you've

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.559 
color so would be minimates one you've
got<00:02:15.150> more<00:02:15.330> of<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.510> light<00:02:16.140> gold<00:02:16.560> with<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.569> with

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
got more of a light gold with the with

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.199 
got more of a light gold with the with
the<00:02:18.950> turn<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.069> corner<00:02:20.280> 28<00:02:20.730> inch<00:02:20.910> one<00:02:21.090> you've

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
the turn the corner 28 inch one you've

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.970 
the turn the corner 28 inch one you've
got<00:02:21.240> more<00:02:21.540> of<00:02:21.600> a<00:02:21.780> cream<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.620> kind<00:02:22.800> of

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
got more of a cream and a kind of

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.540 
got more of a cream and a kind of
whitish<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:24.000> then<00:02:24.300> for<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:25.430> diamond<00:02:26.430> slot

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
whitish and then for the diamond slot

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.800 
whitish and then for the diamond slot
when<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:26.820> kind<00:02:26.940> of<00:02:27.060> straight<00:02:27.300> up<00:02:27.420> yellow

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
when you kind of straight up yellow

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.110 
when you kind of straight up yellow
overall<00:02:28.560> he<00:02:28.920> should<00:02:29.160> have<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.370> yellowish<00:02:29.820> tint

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
overall he should have a yellowish tint

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.550 
overall he should have a yellowish tint
I<00:02:30.270> think<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.570> minimates<00:02:31.080> one<00:02:31.290> really

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
I think the minimates one really

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.260 
I think the minimates one really
demonstrates<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.070> well<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.940> diamond

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
demonstrates that well the diamond

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.360 
demonstrates that well the diamond
select<00:02:33.390> is<00:02:33.600> just<00:02:33.810> too<00:02:34.080> yellow<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.709> then<00:02:35.160> the

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
select is just too yellow and then the

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.710 
select is just too yellow and then the
of<00:02:35.580> course<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.880> three<00:02:36.090> in<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.209> correction

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
of course the three in the correction

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.750 
of course the three in the correction
and<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.959> 8<00:02:37.140> inch<00:02:37.350> aren't<00:02:37.800> yellow<00:02:37.980> also<00:02:38.550> i

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
and the 8 inch aren't yellow also i

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.180 
and the 8 inch aren't yellow also i
think<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:40.020> minimates<00:02:40.739> one<00:02:40.950> has<00:02:41.160> a

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
think that the the minimates one has a

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.000 
think that the the minimates one has a
down<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.790> best<00:02:41.970> although<00:02:42.870> it's<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:43.620> tensor

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
down the best although it's a tensor

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.259 
down the best although it's a tensor
angel<00:02:44.250> i'll<00:02:44.340> give<00:02:44.489> me<00:02:44.580> that<00:02:44.700> aluminum<00:02:45.150> this
