00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
James Parker out of the u.s. he tried it

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.030 
James Parker out of the u.s. he tried it
on<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.180> couple<00:02:12.390> of<00:02:12.569> bucks<00:02:12.840> himself<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.890> then<00:02:14.010> he

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
on a couple of bucks himself and then he

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.520 
on a couple of bucks himself and then he
convinced<00:02:14.489> Yamaha<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.360> license<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:15.989> from<00:02:16.230> him

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
convinced Yamaha to license it from him

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.009 
convinced Yamaha to license it from him
now<00:02:16.890> Yamaha<00:02:17.459> built<00:02:18.120> this<00:02:18.299> at<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.510> time<00:02:18.750> when

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
now Yamaha built this at a time when

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.589 
now Yamaha built this at a time when
people<00:02:19.200> were<00:02:19.379> convinced<00:02:20.040> that<00:02:20.250> there<00:02:21.239> must<00:02:21.450> be

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
people were convinced that there must be

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.539 
people were convinced that there must be
a<00:02:21.780> better<00:02:21.959> way<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.319> suspend<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.040> front<00:02:23.280> end<00:02:23.430> of

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
a better way to suspend the front end of

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.699 
a better way to suspend the front end of
a<00:02:23.640> bug<00:02:23.819> thang<00:02:24.540> traditional<00:02:25.110> forks<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:25.650> the

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
a bug thang traditional forks and the

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.100 
a bug thang traditional forks and the
idea<00:02:26.040> behind<00:02:26.160> this<00:02:26.580> is<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:27.269> separates<00:02:27.840> the

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
idea behind this is it separates the

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.740 
idea behind this is it separates the
braking<00:02:28.590> forces<00:02:28.980> from<00:02:29.730> suspension<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.599> the

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
braking forces from suspension and the

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.449 
braking forces from suspension and the
steering<00:02:30.780> it<00:02:31.349> actually<00:02:31.680> makes<00:02:31.860> quite<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.190> lot

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
steering it actually makes quite a lot

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.490 
steering it actually makes quite a lot
of<00:02:32.489> sense<00:02:32.760> so<00:02:33.360> does<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:33.660> work<00:02:33.690> so<00:02:33.870> much<00:02:34.260> for<00:02:34.440> all

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
of sense so does it work so much for all

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.350 
of sense so does it work so much for all
the<00:02:34.620> flash<00:02:34.829> and<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.069> Pam<00:02:35.280> stuff<00:02:35.610> well<00:02:36.030> yes<00:02:36.180> it

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
the flash and the Pam stuff well yes it

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.630 
the flash and the Pam stuff well yes it
does<00:02:36.540> actually<00:02:36.829> this<00:02:37.829> bike<00:02:38.099> is<00:02:38.280> set<00:02:38.459> up

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
does actually this bike is set up

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.370 
does actually this bike is set up
basically<00:02:39.120> as<00:02:39.299> a<00:02:39.329> sports<00:02:39.690> tourer<00:02:40.079> and<00:02:40.319> if

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
basically as a sports tourer and if

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.199 
basically as a sports tourer and if
anything<00:02:40.620> leans<00:02:40.980> on<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.310> side<00:02:41.519> of<00:02:41.670> touring<00:02:42.000> so

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
anything leans on the side of touring so

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.479 
anything leans on the side of touring so
it<00:02:42.269> steers<00:02:42.599> pretty<00:02:43.079> slow<00:02:43.349> but<00:02:44.099> what<00:02:44.280> it<00:02:44.400> is

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
it steers pretty slow but what it is

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.150 
it steers pretty slow but what it is
remarkable<00:02:45.299> for<00:02:45.360> is<00:02:45.750> it's<00:02:46.200> incredibly<00:02:46.860> stable

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
remarkable for is it's incredibly stable

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.430 
remarkable for is it's incredibly stable
through<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.700> bumpy<00:02:48.060> corner<00:02:48.450> almost<00:02:48.780> nothing<00:02:49.290> is

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
through a bumpy corner almost nothing is

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.589 
through a bumpy corner almost nothing is
going<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.890> knock<00:02:50.069> it<00:02:50.099> off<00:02:50.310> line<00:02:50.579> and<00:02:50.910> while

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
going to knock it off line and while

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.199 
going to knock it off line and while
it's<00:02:51.780> only<00:02:52.079> got<00:02:52.200> one<00:02:52.470> disc<00:02:52.860> on<00:02:53.160> this<00:02:53.910> front

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
it's only got one disc on this front

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.690 
it's only got one disc on this front
wheel<00:02:54.450> it's<00:02:55.049> centrally<00:02:55.680> mounted<00:02:55.860> with<00:02:56.370> a<00:02:56.400> six

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
wheel it's centrally mounted with a six

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.610 
wheel it's centrally mounted with a six
piston<00:02:57.090> caliper<00:02:57.599> and<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:58.110> idea<00:02:58.440> of<00:02:58.500> the

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
piston caliper and the idea of the

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.020 
piston caliper and the idea of the
central<00:02:58.980> mountain<00:02:59.099> is<00:02:59.370> it<00:02:59.489> keeps<00:02:59.730> all<00:02:59.910> the

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
central mountain is it keeps all the

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.670 
central mountain is it keeps all the
forces<00:03:00.420> in<00:03:00.540> line<00:03:00.720> with<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.019> bike<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.470> it

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
forces in line with the bike and it

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.590 
forces in line with the bike and it
actually<00:03:01.829> seems<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.430> work<00:03:02.670> this<00:03:03.209> did<00:03:03.420> actually

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
actually seems to work this did actually

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.809 
actually seems to work this did actually
have<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:04.139> bit<00:03:04.290> of<00:03:04.319> promise<00:03:04.590> as<00:03:05.250> something<00:03:05.700> to

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
have a bit of promise as something to

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.550 
have a bit of promise as something to
look<00:03:05.940> after<00:03:06.180> there's<00:03:06.600> really<00:03:06.810> no<00:03:07.049> gimmicks<00:03:07.410> or

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
look after there's really no gimmicks or

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.559 
look after there's really no gimmicks or
tricks<00:03:07.859> to<00:03:08.069> it<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.609> only<00:03:09.030> thing<00:03:09.239> you<00:03:09.329> need<00:03:09.540> to

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
tricks to it the only thing you need to

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.599 
tricks to it the only thing you need to
remember<00:03:09.810> is<00:03:10.410> that<00:03:10.739> with<00:03:10.920> that<00:03:11.130> front<00:03:11.430> end

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
remember is that with that front end

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.789 
remember is that with that front end
it's<00:03:11.850> supposed<00:03:12.209> to<00:03:12.359> be<00:03:12.480> checked<00:03:12.720> every<00:03:12.870> 10,000

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
it's supposed to be checked every 10,000

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.080 
it's supposed to be checked every 10,000
but<00:03:14.099> given<00:03:14.370> it<00:03:14.459> something<00:03:14.790> that's<00:03:14.880> a<00:03:15.000> little

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
but given it something that's a little

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.059 
but given it something that's a little
bit<00:03:15.239> unusual<00:03:15.510> I'd<00:03:16.200> be<00:03:16.440> taking<00:03:16.769> that<00:03:16.950> advice

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
bit unusual I'd be taking that advice

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.180 
bit unusual I'd be taking that advice
pretty<00:03:17.519> seriously<00:03:18.500> one<00:03:19.500> of<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.650> nice<00:03:19.829> things

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
pretty seriously one of the nice things

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.039 
pretty seriously one of the nice things
about<00:03:20.310> its<00:03:20.670> design<00:03:20.819> was<00:03:21.269> it<00:03:21.450> specifically

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
about its design was it specifically

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.650 
about its design was it specifically
designed<00:03:22.709> for<00:03:23.069> long<00:03:23.280> distances<00:03:23.910> with<00:03:24.450> two

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
designed for long distances with two

people<00:03:24.900> on<00:03:25.139> board<00:03:25.380> you<00:03:25.680> could<00:03:25.920> get<00:03:26.099> in<00:03:26.220> chess

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
people on board you could get in chess

three<00:03:26.700> set<00:03:26.910> of<00:03:27.000> luggage<00:03:27.209> but<00:03:27.540> it<00:03:27.599> was<00:03:27.690> pretty

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
three set of luggage but it was pretty

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.629 
three set of luggage but it was pretty
ugly<00:03:28.079> and<00:03:28.380> I'm<00:03:28.440> not<00:03:28.590> sure<00:03:28.709> I'd<00:03:28.829> bother<00:03:29.130> but

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
ugly and I'm not sure I'd bother but

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:30.920 
ugly and I'm not sure I'd bother but
it's<00:03:29.910> actually<00:03:30.209> a<00:03:30.239> very<00:03:30.299> comfortable

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
it's actually a very comfortable

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.319 
it's actually a very comfortable

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
motorcycles beyond the body works well

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.150 
motorcycles beyond the body works well
thought-out<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:33.810> surprisingly<00:03:34.440> protective

thought-out and surprisingly protective

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.430 
thought-out and surprisingly protective
and<00:03:35.340> because<00:03:35.940> it<00:03:36.120> rides<00:03:36.389> so<00:03:36.750> well<00:03:36.989> it's<00:03:37.319> a

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
and because it rides so well it's a

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.709 

look<00:03:56.400> I<00:03:56.519> could<00:03:56.670> talk<00:03:56.849> about<00:03:56.969> this<00:03:57.209> bike<00:03:57.480> all

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:57.719 
look I could talk about this bike all

00:03:57.719 --> 00:03:59.990 
look I could talk about this bike all
day<00:03:57.900> really<00:03:58.379> trust<00:03:58.590> me<00:03:58.709> I<00:03:58.739> could<00:03:59.010> but<00:03:59.640> the<00:03:59.849> real

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
day really trust me I could but the real

day really trust me I could but the real
truth<00:04:00.329> is<00:04:00.540> actually<00:04:00.689> riding<00:04:01.109> it<00:04:03.260> this<00:04:04.260> is<00:04:04.469> the

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
truth is actually riding it this is the

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.589 
truth is actually riding it this is the
ultimate<00:04:04.890> contradiction<00:04:05.849> in<00:04:05.969> terms
