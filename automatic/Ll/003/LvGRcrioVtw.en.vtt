this<00:01:19.380> would<00:01:19.590> be<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> little<00:01:20.159> bit<00:01:20.310> easier

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
this would be a little bit easier

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.670 
this would be a little bit easier
although<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.630> still<00:01:21.990> challenging<00:01:22.500> this

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
although this is still challenging this

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.260 
although this is still challenging this
is<00:01:22.740> probably<00:01:23.220> one<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.549> hardest<00:01:23.820> spots<00:01:24.060> to

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
is probably one of the hardest spots to

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.359 
is probably one of the hardest spots to
camp<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.659> if<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.900> had<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.140> team<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:26.070> would<00:01:26.250> be

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
camp and if you had a team this would be

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.580 
camp and if you had a team this would be
much<00:01:26.580> easier<00:01:26.820> although<00:01:27.420> at<00:01:27.570> around<00:01:27.780> 23<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.380> was

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
much easier although at around 23 I was

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.950 
much easier although at around 23 I was
able<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.890> survive<00:01:29.189> here<00:01:29.490> just<00:01:29.820> fine<00:01:30.060> moving<00:01:30.810> on

the next camping spot that I had to

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
probably the best place that you're

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
gonna want to do it what I like about

gonna want to do it what I like about
this<00:01:49.229> place<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.799> best<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.460> have<00:01:50.729> an

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
this place the best is that you have an

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.670 
this place the best is that you have an
escape<00:01:51.240> route<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.659> find<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.170> if<00:01:52.290> things<00:01:52.500> get

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
escape route I find that if things get

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.469 
escape route I find that if things get
too<00:01:52.829> hairy<00:01:53.070> what<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.399> can<00:01:53.610> do<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.939> purchase<00:01:54.210> a

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
too hairy what I can do is purchase a

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.670 
too hairy what I can do is purchase a
gate<00:01:54.630> behind<00:01:54.810> me<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.320> I've<00:01:55.439> been<00:01:55.470> keeping

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
gate behind me that I've been keeping

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.740 
gate behind me that I've been keeping
shut<00:01:56.100> for<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.340> whole<00:01:56.520> game<00:01:56.790> you'll<00:01:57.420> notice

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
shut for the whole game you'll notice

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.209 
shut for the whole game you'll notice
that<00:01:57.899> gate<00:01:58.049> behind<00:01:58.380> me<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.710> shut<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.100> what

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
that gate behind me is shut and what

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.100 
that gate behind me is shut and what
that's<00:01:59.369> gonna<00:01:59.460> do<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.880> force<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.390> zombies<00:02:00.869> to

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
that's gonna do is force the zombies to

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.899 
that's gonna do is force the zombies to
spawn<00:02:01.409> in<00:02:01.649> front<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.040> me<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:02.520> will<00:02:02.700> prevent

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
spawn in front of me this will prevent

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.520 
spawn in front of me this will prevent
them<00:02:03.060> from<00:02:03.119> spawning<00:02:03.600> behind<00:02:03.899> me<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.320> won't

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
them from spawning behind me and I won't

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.050 
them from spawning behind me and I won't
have<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.829> watch<00:02:04.950> my<00:02:05.250> back<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.670> this<00:02:05.820> really

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
have to watch my back and this really

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.359 
have to watch my back and this really
makes<00:02:06.329> my<00:02:06.509> life<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.869> lot<00:02:07.049> easier<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.799> also<00:02:08.129> have<00:02:08.310> a

to<00:02:39.790> camp<00:02:40.210> I<00:02:40.480> like<00:02:40.900> this<00:02:41.020> place<00:02:41.290> because<00:02:41.650> of<00:02:41.680> how

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
to camp I like this place because of how

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.440 
to camp I like this place because of how
intense<00:02:42.340> it<00:02:42.490> will<00:02:42.610> get<00:02:42.760> in<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.060> later<00:02:43.240> rounds

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
intense it will get in the later rounds

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.720 
intense it will get in the later rounds
there<00:02:44.080> is<00:02:44.230> only<00:02:44.410> one<00:02:44.740> way<00:02:44.890> out<00:02:45.100> of<00:02:45.130> this<00:02:45.280> area

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
there is only one way out of this area

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.130 
there is only one way out of this area
and<00:02:45.940> that<00:02:46.060> is<00:02:46.180> in<00:02:46.300> front<00:02:46.510> of<00:02:46.600> you<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:46.870> that's

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
and that is in front of you and that's

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.960 
and that is in front of you and that's
where<00:02:47.380> all<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.590> zombies<00:02:47.980> are<00:02:48.130> spawning<00:02:48.490> and

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
where all the zombies are spawning and

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.400 
where all the zombies are spawning and
if<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.210> zombies<00:02:49.540> from<00:02:49.600> that<00:02:49.870> window<00:02:50.080> get

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
if the zombies from that window get

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.170 
if the zombies from that window get
behind<00:02:50.770> you<00:02:50.950> you<00:02:51.160> can<00:02:51.310> basically<00:02:51.520> consider

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
behind you you can basically consider

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.330 
behind you you can basically consider
yourself<00:02:52.690> dead<00:02:52.990> now<00:02:53.500> if<00:02:53.620> you<00:02:53.770> don't<00:02:54.010> have<00:02:54.310> a

acid get in this area that you make sure

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.300 
acid get in this area that you make sure
you<00:03:25.750> don't<00:03:25.959> let<00:03:26.170> the<00:03:26.260> bolts<00:03:26.530> get<00:03:26.709> too<00:03:26.860> close<00:03:27.070> to

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
you don't let the bolts get too close to

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.600 
you don't let the bolts get too close to
you

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
you

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.250 
you
so<00:03:28.000> you<00:03:28.060> don't<00:03:28.300> kill<00:03:28.540> yourself<00:03:28.930> now<00:03:29.110> you'll

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260

so you don't kill yourself now you'll
notice<00:03:29.500> one<00:03:30.040> of<00:03:30.070> the<00:03:30.220> advantages<00:03:30.910> to<00:03:30.970> having

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
notice one of the advantages to having

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.820 
notice one of the advantages to having
the<00:03:31.420> ray<00:03:31.540> gun<00:03:31.720> is<00:03:31.750> that<00:03:31.989> you<00:03:32.080> can<00:03:32.230> quickly<00:03:32.470> kill

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.860 
quickly when you're camping in an area
like<00:03:36.880> this<00:03:37.000> because<00:03:37.270> you<00:03:37.390> don't<00:03:37.540> have<00:03:37.690> much

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870

like this because you don't have much
space<00:03:38.140> to<00:03:38.170> move<00:03:38.590> so<00:03:39.220> if<00:03:39.520> you<00:03:39.700> are<00:03:39.910> gonna<00:03:40.180> camp

the<00:03:47.500> final<00:03:47.830> camping<00:03:48.130> spot<00:03:48.340> I<00:03:48.370> have<00:03:48.640> for<00:03:48.820> you<00:03:48.940> is

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
the final camping spot I have for you is

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.820 
the final camping spot I have for you is
on<00:03:49.420> these<00:03:49.630> turkeys<00:03:50.140> in<00:03:50.320> between<00:03:50.709> the

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
on these turkeys in between the

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.040 
on these turkeys in between the
infirmary<00:03:51.190> in<00:03:51.519> the<00:03:51.610> cafeteria<00:03:52.330> now<00:03:52.720> this<00:03:52.900> is

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
infirmary in the cafeteria now this is

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.630 
infirmary in the cafeteria now this is
probably<00:03:53.290> one<00:03:53.410> of<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.530> easier<00:03:53.920> camping<00:03:54.400> spots

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
probably one of the easier camping spots

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.759 
probably one of the easier camping spots
on<00:03:54.880> this<00:03:55.030> map<00:03:55.330> and<00:03:55.570> it's<00:03:55.720> easy<00:03:55.989> because<00:03:56.290> you

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
on this map and it's easy because you

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.710 
on this map and it's easy because you
have<00:03:56.950> an<00:03:57.100> escape<00:03:57.519> route<00:03:57.760> if<00:03:58.090> you<00:03:58.300> ever<00:03:58.480> find

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
have an escape route if you ever find

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.300 
have an escape route if you ever find
that<00:03:58.870> things<00:03:59.080> get<00:03:59.350> too<00:03:59.470> hairy<00:03:59.680> all<00:04:00.100> you<00:04:00.220> have

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
that things get too hairy all you have

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.860 
that things get too hairy all you have
to<00:04:00.400> do<00:04:00.519> is<00:04:00.640> open<00:04:00.850> up<00:04:01.060> the<00:04:01.120> door<00:04:01.269> at<00:04:01.600> the<00:04:01.690> very

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
to do is open up the door at the very

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.630 
to do is open up the door at the very
bottom<00:04:02.050> of<00:04:02.320> the<00:04:02.410> staircase<00:04:02.920> although<00:04:03.400> make

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
bottom of the staircase although make

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.130 
bottom of the staircase although make
sure<00:04:03.820> you<00:04:03.970> keep<00:04:04.150> that<00:04:04.209> door<00:04:04.540> shut<00:04:04.570> because

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
sure you keep that door shut because

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.080 
sure you keep that door shut because
once<00:04:05.440> you<00:04:05.590> open<00:04:05.920> up<00:04:06.010> that<00:04:06.070> staircase<00:04:06.700> you<00:04:06.730> can

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
once you open up that staircase you can

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.330 
once you open up that staircase you can
no<00:04:07.239> longer<00:04:07.570> camp<00:04:07.989> here<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.739> spawns<00:04:09.040> will<00:04:09.220> get

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
no longer camp here the spawns will get

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.009 
no longer camp here the spawns will get
too<00:04:09.489> hectic<00:04:09.910> because<00:04:10.060> the<00:04:10.360> zombies<00:04:10.690> will<00:04:10.900> be

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
too hectic because the zombies will be

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.660 
too hectic because the zombies will be
spawning<00:04:11.350> in<00:04:11.530> front<00:04:11.739> of<00:04:11.830> you<00:04:11.950> and<00:04:12.130> behind<00:04:12.400> you

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
spawning in front of you and behind you

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.280 
spawning in front of you and behind you
but<00:04:13.180> what's<00:04:13.330> nice<00:04:13.450> about<00:04:13.510> keeping<00:04:13.989> the<00:04:14.110> door

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
but what's nice about keeping the door

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.080 
but what's nice about keeping the door
shut<00:04:14.590> is<00:04:14.739> that<00:04:14.920> the<00:04:15.040> zombies<00:04:15.340> will<00:04:15.519> only<00:04:15.700> spawn

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
shut is that the zombies will only spawn

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.759 
shut is that the zombies will only spawn
in<00:04:16.209> front<00:04:16.450> of<00:04:16.540> you<00:04:16.660> and<00:04:16.810> you<00:04:17.200> only<00:04:17.380> have<00:04:17.650> to

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
in front of you and you only have to

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.039 
in front of you and you only have to
watch<00:04:17.919> one<00:04:17.950> direction<00:04:18.700> a<00:04:18.880> camping<00:04:19.480> spot<00:04:19.630> will

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
watch one direction a camping spot will

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.570 
watch one direction a camping spot will
fail<00:04:20.320> when<00:04:20.590> you<00:04:20.650> and<00:04:21.039> a<00:04:21.070> teammates<00:04:21.460> are

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
fail when you and a teammates are

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:22.980 
fail when you and a teammates are
watching<00:04:21.910> multiple<00:04:22.300> directions<00:04:22.600> but

watching multiple directions but

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.470 
watching multiple directions but
watching

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480

spawn to your left and if you just keep

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.930 
spawn to your left and if you just keep
that<00:04:51.860> in<00:04:52.040> mind<00:04:52.250> you<00:04:52.370> can<00:04:52.550> better<00:04:52.730> prepare
