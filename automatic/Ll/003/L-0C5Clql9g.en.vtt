keyboard<00:00:45.360> it's<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:46.200> little<00:00:46.829> bit

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
keyboard it's a little bit

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.470 
keyboard it's a little bit
unconventional<00:00:47.250> looking<00:00:47.969> but<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.180> find<00:00:48.420> that

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
unconventional looking but I find that

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.630 
unconventional looking but I find that
it<00:00:48.629> works<00:00:48.719> quite<00:00:48.989> well<00:00:49.110> this<00:00:49.800> very<00:00:50.160> large<00:00:50.309> key

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
it works quite well this very large key

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.729 
it works quite well this very large key
here<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.480> Alt<00:00:51.629> key<00:00:51.750> for<00:00:52.170> symbols<00:00:52.559> and

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
here is the Alt key for symbols and

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.830 
here is the Alt key for symbols and
numbers<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.309> it's<00:00:53.430> excessively<00:00:54.180> large<00:00:54.449> for

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
numbers and it's excessively large for

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.869 
numbers and it's excessively large for
some<00:00:54.989> reason<00:00:55.320> compared<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.430> shift<00:00:56.670> keys

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
some reason compared to the shift keys

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.970 
some reason compared to the shift keys
but<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.780> general<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.320> think<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.530> keyboard<00:00:58.829> has

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
but in general I think the keyboard has

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.889 
but in general I think the keyboard has
a<00:00:59.010> very<00:00:59.280> nice<00:00:59.460> feel<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.059> everything<00:01:00.480> seems<00:01:00.870> to

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
a very nice feel and everything seems to

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.020 
a very nice feel and everything seems to
be<00:01:00.960> laid<00:01:01.170> out<00:01:01.320> quite<00:01:01.500> well<00:01:01.789> four<00:01:02.789> rows<00:01:03.000> of

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
be laid out quite well four rows of

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.179 
be laid out quite well four rows of
course<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:03.629> things<00:01:04.110> aren't<00:01:04.350> messed<00:01:04.830> up<00:01:05.010> by<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
course so things aren't messed up by the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.390 
course so things aren't messed up by the
space<00:01:05.489> bar<00:01:05.670> which<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:05.909> very<00:01:06.240> large<00:01:06.450> indeed
