00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.430 

the<00:00:02.760> first<00:00:03.000> step<00:00:03.210> on<00:00:03.419> running<00:00:03.870> a<00:00:03.929> skateboard

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
the first step on running a skateboard

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.840 
the first step on running a skateboard
is<00:00:04.529> figuring<00:00:04.920> out<00:00:04.920> which<00:00:05.190> stance<00:00:05.520> you<00:00:05.700> are

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
is figuring out which stance you are

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.089 
is figuring out which stance you are
stance<00:00:06.720> is<00:00:06.870> determined<00:00:07.379> by<00:00:07.470> which<00:00:07.740> foot<00:00:08.069> you

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
stance is determined by which foot you

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.310 
stance is determined by which foot you
put<00:00:08.429> forward<00:00:08.700> if<00:00:09.540> you<00:00:09.630> put<00:00:09.809> your<00:00:09.990> left<00:00:10.200> foot

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
put forward if you put your left foot

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.940 
put forward if you put your left foot
forward<00:00:10.710> you<00:00:11.670> are<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.849> regular<00:00:12.120> skater<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:12.950> by

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
forward you are a regular skater and by

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.799 
forward you are a regular skater and by
putting<00:00:14.160> your<00:00:14.309> right<00:00:14.580> foot<00:00:14.849> forward<00:00:14.880> you're

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
putting your right foot forward you're

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.980 
putting your right foot forward you're
what<00:00:16.139> they<00:00:16.260> call<00:00:16.289> goofy<00:00:16.859> skater<00:00:17.330> so<00:00:18.330> there's

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
what they call goofy skater so there's

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.410 
what they call goofy skater so there's
no<00:00:19.199> scientific<00:00:19.619> method<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.789> find<00:00:21.000> out<00:00:21.240> which

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
no scientific method to find out which

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.269 
no scientific method to find out which
way<00:00:21.660> you<00:00:21.720> are<00:00:21.960> it's<00:00:22.529> simply<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:22.949> matter<00:00:23.010> of

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279

trial error find out which way you're

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.509 
trial error find out which way you're
more<00:00:25.320> comfortable<00:00:25.590> with<00:00:28.189> after<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.310> know

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
more comfortable with after you know

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.580 
more comfortable with after you know
what<00:00:29.789> stance<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.269> are<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.900> first<00:00:31.170> step<00:00:31.410> is

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
what stance you are the first step is

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.840 
what stance you are the first step is
learning<00:00:31.769> how<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.070> push<00:00:32.340> on<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.550> skateboard

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
learning how to push on a skateboard

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.600 
learning how to push on a skateboard
it's<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.690> fairly<00:00:33.989> easy<00:00:34.140> thing<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:35.190> learn<00:00:35.309> how<00:00:35.370> to

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
it's a fairly easy thing to learn how to

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.330 
it's a fairly easy thing to learn how to
do<00:00:35.790> once<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.329> know<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.540> proper<00:00:36.899> technique<00:00:37.350> so

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
do once you know the proper technique so

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.990 
do once you know the proper technique so
with<00:00:38.520> your<00:00:38.550> front<00:00:38.879> foot<00:00:40.460> put<00:00:41.460> your<00:00:41.640> front<00:00:41.910> foot

nose of the board you want to make sure

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.420 
nose of the board you want to make sure
that<00:00:47.370> your<00:00:47.700> nose<00:00:48.289> the<00:00:49.289> board<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.710> not<00:00:49.980> touching

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
that your nose the board is not touching

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.819 
that your nose the board is not touching
the<00:00:51.149> top<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.539> your<00:00:51.600> foot<00:00:51.840> because<00:00:52.440> if<00:00:52.620> that

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
going to go directly to the ground so

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.529 
going to go directly to the ground so
it's<00:01:00.469> these<00:01:01.469> three<00:01:01.920> bolts<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.300> want
