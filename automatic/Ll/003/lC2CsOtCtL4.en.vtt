00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.290
 let's give some real examples of 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.170
 creperies is first the cart 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.760
 of crepes is the traditional cart I think 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.800
 I one of the business models more 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:26.039
 efficient and effective there can be 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.529
 of two types of gas or light that 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:34.590
 that depends if it's the gas cart 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:37.800
 we only require a small tank of 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.160
 gas unfortunately there are regulations 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.220
 with respect to gas if it were out of light 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.650
 we need the the light connection for 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.930
 which we would have to fix them 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.600
 fix with someone 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.270
 This type of crêperies are ideal for 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.220
 shopping centers where they can give us 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.800
 a space can rent us a meter 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.200
 square or two square meters for 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.300
 very small premises or bits of 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.939
 Local've seen many people who 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.520
 subarrendó local that is already there is a 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.960
 local established a hairdresser a 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.650
 esthetic 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.320
 a store for something and a small 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.900
 space within that location and they are 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.090
 pay an income that can be a very 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.240
 good strategy to start with 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.610
 our creperie project the squares 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.220
 same as we mentioned above all the 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.070
 squares that are open allow this 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.280
 kind of things sometimes allow us 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.619
 put us in the middle of the corridors 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.810
 schools mostly right now the problem 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.289
 in mexico with schools has to do with 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.000
 the caloric restrictions that is being 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.910
 prohibiting schools from 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.070
 sell certain things and this depends on the 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.479
 number of calories so if you 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.759
 I would do in a school 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.869
 comply with those rules and you would have to 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.869
 comply with the rules 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.780
 corresponding school district 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.660
 government offices are also sometimes 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.630
 they make tenders that you can see them in 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.990
 compranet or you can see them in the government 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.610
 of the state are constantly made 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.980
 Calls or bids for 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.470
 businesses that want to install in 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.320
 new government offices or in some 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.440
 type of government facility well 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:30.130
 so do hospitals and 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.650
 charitable institutions where 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.710
 although do not believe it because the patients and 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.530
 the relatives of the patients spend 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:42.530
 so long that sometimes they would like 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.540
 something within the institution is also 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.150
 they give some kind of licenses in the 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.170
 hospitals for these cases the events 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.630
 social here a very good investment 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.420
 as a first business or second business is 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:00.320
 a crepería for this type of events 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.050
 as weddings christenings 15 years we can 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.530
 do 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:08.230
 a small investment and start 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.300
 promote us for those events the people 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.780
 spend a lot on events and crepes 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:17.290
 they are a good way to satisfy that 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.480
 demand for something different even 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.180
 can do something designed to fit 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.010
 the people and you would only have 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.650
 to work some days of the week 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.470
 is a great advantage of this model of 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.930
 business catering and banquets all the 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.880
 part of the banquet we could complete 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.190
 us with someone of banquets that he us 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.130
 promote us and we promote 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.190
 them to them and then we be a 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.930
 part of the banquets and finally in 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.450
 other restaurants that we can make 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.030
 the service for example of crepes for 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.220
 the dessert then these carts yes
