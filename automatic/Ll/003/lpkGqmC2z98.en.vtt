00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.570
 comic book character he has 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:33.840

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.400
 breaking news 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.820
 quitting leaves to actually hire that 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.820
 I violent 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.390
 the cold in the united states it continues so 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.739
 although in Spokane in the state of 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.839

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.789

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:53.620
 wait at the base a step go you 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:55.269
 to see so 5 4 3 2 it's a beautiful 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.860
 lesson of courage that offers us this 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:58.540
 student of a university of san 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.640
 francisco who will succeed despite the 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.920
 pain to cross the finish line 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.440
 it really makes you want to 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.590
 sport when you go to the hairdresser in 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.090
 alaska you have to expect everything 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.590
 admire the hairdresser who finishes when 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.240
 even the cut he has to tell himself that it's 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.340
 not a bad idea to do barber 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.800
 and parkings them during that time to 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.600
 nanaimo in canada a man has too much 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.460
 breathe the smoke from his burning house 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.590
 a good thing is that he looks like 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.259
 take everything well there he is not happy 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.119
 I believe when a presenter 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:29.740
 Danish asks robbie williams to 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.240
 what he is able for 30 euros the 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.170

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.549
 heart of his fans 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.560
 so it's good now we know 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.390
 how he will pay for his next car 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.860
 and to finish sometimes we have to stay 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.929
 humble even though they won a fight 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.750
 of ultimate fighting go back down 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:44.979
 stop doing the move ok he had to 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.549
 leave his brain in the locker room 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.549
 for that 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.690
