00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 Hello dear friends and in this form 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:09.349
 I will show a couple of interesting and the most 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.700
 important very very simple schemes 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.219
 There are several ways to combine 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.800
 a few wires is fine and way 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:23.400
 which I will show you now the peace 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:25.699
 abrasion is simple so let's say both 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.170
 our system will have these buttons 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.970
 It is worth noting that the stella signal 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.640
 must be on all entrances 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.059
 identical connect all the outputs of one 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.399
 wire and put a comparator on the end 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:41.090
 Well, now we build the track itself 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.399
 block redstone block 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:47.219
 comparator and now all over again block 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:51.780
 redstone block comparator block redstone 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:55.770
 block parats and so on to the end 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.680
 schemes left the city again and no cooler on 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.239
 set the comporator their calculation mode on 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.390
 this comparator is served maximum 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.390
 signal 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.170
 opposite the comparator mode 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.860
 calculations from track 2 of blocks and 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.560
 which we cover sheets set to 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.340
 this unit through one red torches 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.080
 opposite each entrance 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.190
 digging in two blocks and carry out 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.190
 redstone like this 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:34.439
 we put on a piece of arrested behind the clouds 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.429
 sleep he put blocks over them to 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.890
 no signal connected 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:45.140
 between 6 us to roll one by one 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.140
 block we put a repeater there 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.289
 the circuit is almost ready the only negative 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.250
 this is what we have extra 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.950
 triggering 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.659
 however it is easy to fix at the end 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.719
 we put the tracks repeater and hold 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.439
 arrested and along this way 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:02.810
 connect redstone with 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.590
 I did not have enough signal repeaters 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.630
 that's why I am 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.209
 repeater at the end of the track a little bit 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.860
 I will rearrange in this way and here 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.860
 our circuit is completely ready 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.519
 this is a monorail metro on the boat blocks 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.519
 was built in literally 20 minutes 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.140
 this mechanism may still come up 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.629
 quite a while but no one thought up so 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.819
 I have never seen a small scheme anywhere 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:45.519
 normal throw off and see my diagram 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.260
 them here and so is all that is here 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:51.819
 just one by one and not connected a 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:56.459
 here we have a generator caused 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.459
 lever he here is the signal intermittently 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:06.150
 here we will have an entry set 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.950
 blog leader about 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.370
 I am Peter 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.370
 Further 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:18.670
 lipitor block simple and petr 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:26.099
 put redstone 3 peter 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:26.099
 block here block here redstone debtor 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:35.569
 peter legs here new here 6 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:39.110
 Vader Ie we are essentially a common dupen 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:41.510
 two ways to connect such a turn 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.010
 so turn signal first we 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.349
 unfold this way 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.180
 unfolding in this way and so 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:52.599
 Here we alternate for convenience 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:55.400
 here you can build such figures 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:57.680
 they here it is repeated to sign he 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.850
 repeated every other day 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.850
 contact to prove 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.930
 after all, first comes vipe too stone repite 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:21.019
 then arrested peter redstone 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.019
 repeater 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:39.340
 now we build any planet of joy i 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.370
 I'll make it look like this 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:47.419
 put forward 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:47.419
 block we put here hotel 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.620
 what 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:57.950
 now i will repeat the redstone delay oh everything 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:59.230
 our generator starts working that is 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.620
 if we get there 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.620
 signal here 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.470
 he will turn off 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.670
 yes well and replace our car and we 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:13.040
 these blocks are starting to move 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:15.890
 but these piston 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.190
 that's the way you can build to be 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.100
 true 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:22.040
 and the whole mechanism of this watch looks like this 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.530
 this is how it works on this one 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.450
 multichannel switches very 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.880
 simple circuit is not really there 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:31.220
 I don't need to explain anything to them in general 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.870
 decided to share this material in two 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.600
 parts and on this the first series 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:39.100
 ends therefore all thanks for 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.100
 attention luck all bye
