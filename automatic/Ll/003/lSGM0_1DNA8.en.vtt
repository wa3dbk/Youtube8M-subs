to transfer it into a greased baking
baking<00:03:01.629> tin<00:03:02.079> and<00:03:02.920> I<00:03:03.250> think<00:03:03.489> it's<00:03:03.670> if<00:03:04.239> I'm<00:03:04.930> using

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.589 
baking tin and I think it's if I'm using
a<00:03:05.519> silicon<00:03:06.519> mold<00:03:06.909> but<00:03:07.180> if<00:03:07.239> you're<00:03:07.359> using<00:03:07.480> a

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
a silicon mold but if you're using a

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.539 
a silicon mold but if you're using a
metal<00:03:07.930> one<00:03:08.049> you<00:03:08.620> probably<00:03:08.769> should<00:03:09.099> use<00:03:09.250> some

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
metal one you probably should use some

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.360 
metal one you probably should use some
greaseproof<00:03:09.790> paper<00:03:10.030> as<00:03:10.689> well<00:03:10.859> so<00:03:11.859> i'll<00:03:12.189> show

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
greaseproof paper as well so i'll show

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.710

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.110 
squeezed a little tiny bit of the lemon
juice<00:04:02.200> into<00:04:02.620> the<00:04:02.830> chick<00:04:03.040> pea<00:04:03.250> mixture<00:04:03.280> because

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
juice into the chick pea mixture because

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.380 
juice into the chick pea mixture because
my<00:04:05.110> food<00:04:05.920> blender<00:04:06.280> was<00:04:06.640> having<00:04:06.940> problems

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
my food blender was having problems

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.650 
my food blender was having problems
processing<00:04:08.200> the<00:04:08.290> chickpeas<00:04:09.180> so<00:04:10.180> just<00:04:10.390> to<00:04:10.510> thin

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
processing the chickpeas so just to thin

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.569 
processing the chickpeas so just to thin
it<00:04:10.690> down<00:04:10.810> a<00:04:11.019> little<00:04:11.290> bit<00:04:11.530> but<00:04:12.130> apparently<00:04:12.519> if

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
it down a little bit but apparently if

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:14.400 
it down a little bit but apparently if
you<00:04:12.610> put<00:04:12.819> too<00:04:12.849> much<00:04:13.120> lemon<00:04:13.390> juice<00:04:13.720> in<00:04:13.930> it<00:04:13.989> makes

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
you put too much lemon juice in it makes

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.659 
you put too much lemon juice in it makes
the<00:04:14.650> cake<00:04:14.860> quite<00:04:15.670> wet<00:04:16.019> so<00:04:17.370> yeah<00:04:18.370> let's<00:04:18.609> just

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
the cake quite wet so yeah let's just

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:19.979 
the cake quite wet so yeah let's just
see<00:04:18.910> what<00:04:19.030> the<00:04:19.060> cake<00:04:19.269> looks<00:04:19.540> like<00:04:19.750> when<00:04:19.900> it

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
see what the cake looks like when it

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.350 
see what the cake looks like when it
comes<00:04:20.200> out<00:04:20.320> of<00:04:20.380> the<00:04:20.530> oven

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
comes out of the oven

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.850 
comes out of the oven
so<00:04:23.360> I've<00:04:23.510> just<00:04:23.540> taking<00:04:24.080> the<00:04:24.169> cake<00:04:24.380> out<00:04:24.500> of<00:04:24.740> the

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
so I've just taking the cake out of the

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.670 
so I've just taking the cake out of the
oven<00:04:24.949> it's<00:04:25.580> been<00:04:25.790> about<00:04:26.090> 20<00:04:26.540> minutes<00:04:26.750> started

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
oven it's been about 20 minutes started

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.290 
oven it's been about 20 minutes started
it<00:04:27.770> off<00:04:27.919> at<00:04:28.130> two<00:04:28.340> hundred<00:04:28.550> but<00:04:28.910> I<00:04:28.970> think<00:04:29.150> that

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
it off at two hundred but I think that

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.570 
it off at two hundred but I think that
was<00:04:29.419> a<00:04:29.449> bit<00:04:29.570> too<00:04:29.750> vicious<00:04:30.160> so<00:04:31.160> it<00:04:31.280> turned<00:04:31.460> it

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
was a bit too vicious so it turned it

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.960 
was a bit too vicious so it turned it
out<00:04:31.669> turned<00:04:31.729> it<00:04:32.419> down<00:04:32.570> to<00:04:32.750> 180<00:04:33.199> degrees<00:04:33.669> so<00:04:34.669> I'm

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
out turned it down to 180 degrees so I'm

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.120 
out turned it down to 180 degrees so I'm
just<00:04:35.090> going<00:04:35.240> to<00:04:35.300> let<00:04:35.449> it<00:04:35.479> cool<00:04:35.780> now<00:04:36.199> and<00:04:36.590> well
