 championship with 3 kilometers and 100 meters 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.100
 and one of the fastest sections 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.110
 well differentiated from roots roots and 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.570
 jumps would make everyone work hard 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.600
 bikers who will try to achieve 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.980
 best time of the day 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.590
 troy brosnan the winner of the last 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.199
 round in fort william would be one of them 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.420
 the Australian would get his 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:45.420
 Specialized to the third podium drawer 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.360
 thanks to a very fast descent with a 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.440
 average of something more than 48 kilometers 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.930
 time when crossing the finish line would mark 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.949
 the second best momentary time between 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.720
 the laments of the public in second 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.900
 position would end the current champion 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.790
 of the world of great minar descent the 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.920
 South African who was seventh in fort 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.110
 William would mark the best time at 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.830
 pass the finish line beating the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.050
 classification of loris bruni 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.570
 he sat like that in the warm chair to 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.750
 hope that nobody will improve their time with 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.480
 still 12 runners to leave but for his 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.640
 Unfortunately it was not like that in the absence of three 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.650
 riders george graceland who had already 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.450
 touched the victory in Australia in the 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.550
 karting circuit with a second 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.060
 put snatched the best time to 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.670
 mine with a spectacular descent improved 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.680
 the chrono in a second and three tenths 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:43.100
 thus carrying his holy cross- v10 at most 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.900
 high of the podium although he had to suffer 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.610
 because the bruni Ã³ryx that was the most 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.830
 quick in qualifying and the 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.440
 last pulverized the times of the two 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.450
 first sectors but almost at the end in 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.360
 a curve of dry land lost the 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.270
 control and said goodbye to your options the 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:03.250
 British young man of 24 years got that way 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.250
 his first win in the world cup 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.270
 with these results troy brosnan 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.140
 they unseated wing of the leadership and george 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.210
 price land sneaks into third place 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.280
 in the female category after his punctures 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.100
 at fort william they were back up 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.820
 hand carpenter and rachel hit the 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:37.670
 winners of the first two tests in 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.860
 third place ended miami with this 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.260
 24- year-old French woman is demonstrating 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.450
 much perseverance this season and has 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.910
 finished among the four best all 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.010
 the races even though he has not won in 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.870
 no occasion his great technique of 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.290
 descent makes it one of the 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.060
 favorites for the fight for victory 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.160
 when crossing the finish line he marked the 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.350
 better time since then but still 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.020
 they were about to go out to do tom road and 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.000
 carpenter 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.100
 Rachel doing ton left immediately 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.560
 after the carrier of the jersey 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.200
 rainbow was faster and I was going 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.570
 scratching seconds in each sector at 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.910
 crossing the finish line started the best 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.610
 time for something more than a second and it 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.800
 placed as virtual leader and almost what 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.640
 get because ragot could not with her 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.800
 but without hands carpenter 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.490
 the 21-year-old British girl was the most 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.440
 fast reaching an average speed of 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.870
 46 kilometers per hour and got the 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.730
 better time with a margin of more than 2 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.819
 seconds and a half over the current 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.890
 carpenter world champion who 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:44.209
 he showed very satisfied he gets his 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.209
 second victory of the season 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:03.960
 and that was a good carpenter hand 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.210
 consolidates its leadership and classification 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.430
 general remains the same in the area 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.709
 high 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:14.200
