was top and camera 40 okay and for the

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.980 
was top and camera 40 okay and for the
camera<00:02:30.630> which<00:02:31.110> is<00:02:31.260> this<00:02:31.440> is<00:02:31.890> where<00:02:32.480> it<00:02:33.480> takes<00:02:33.810> a

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
camera which is this is where it takes a

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.620 
camera which is this is where it takes a
picture<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.650> our<00:02:34.970> objects<00:02:35.970> we've<00:02:36.090> created<00:02:36.390> and

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
picture of our objects we've created and

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.290 
picture of our objects we've created and
turns<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:36.960> into<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.260> 2d<00:02:37.680> image<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.940> I'll<00:02:39.060> do<00:02:39.210> an

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
turns it into a 2d image and I'll do an

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.980 
turns it into a 2d image and I'll do an
animation<00:02:39.720> it'll<00:02:40.230> take<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.650> sequences<00:02:41.430> of

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
animation it'll take a sequences of

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.390 
animation it'll take a sequences of
pictures<00:02:42.990> and<00:02:43.020> combine<00:02:43.830> them<00:02:43.860> together<00:02:44.160> to

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
pictures and combine them together to

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.760 
pictures and combine them together to
make<00:02:44.870> AV<00:02:45.870> eyes<00:02:45.990> gifs<00:02:46.950> stuff<00:02:47.460> like<00:02:47.610> that

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
make AV eyes gifs stuff like that

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.560 
make AV eyes gifs stuff like that
alright<00:02:49.770> so<00:02:49.920> hit<00:02:50.130> zero<00:02:50.460> on<00:02:50.670> your<00:02:50.910> numeric

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
keypad to go on the camera view okay so

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.370 
keypad to go on the camera view okay so
we're<00:02:54.900> now<00:02:55.110> are<00:02:55.290> in<00:02:55.410> camera<00:02:55.770> view<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:57.170> this<00:02:58.170> is

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
we're now are in camera view and this is

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.650 
we're now are in camera view and this is
our<00:02:58.590> cube<00:02:59.190> that<00:02:59.370> we<00:02:59.490> day<00:02:59.730> before<00:03:00.060> we<00:03:00.630> were

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
our cube that we day before we were

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
our cube that we day before we were
navigating<00:03:01.320> around<00:03:01.740> before<00:03:02.690> well<00:03:03.690> we're<00:03:04.560> not

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
navigating around before well we're not

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.900 
navigating around before well we're not
going<00:03:04.830> to<00:03:04.890> talk<00:03:05.070> about<00:03:05.160> editing<00:03:05.550> in<00:03:05.730> this

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
going to talk about editing in this

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.670 
going to talk about editing in this
video<00:03:06.120> but<00:03:06.480> I<00:03:06.540> will<00:03:06.810> tell<00:03:06.960> you<00:03:07.020> how<00:03:07.110> to<00:03:07.140> move<00:03:07.440> an

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
video but I will tell you how to move an

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.490 
video but I will tell you how to move an
object<00:03:07.830> around<00:03:08.310> an<00:03:08.490> object<00:03:08.700> mode<00:03:09.330> there's<00:03:10.320> a

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
object around an object mode there's a

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.720 
object around an object mode there's a
different<00:03:10.830> from<00:03:11.010> edit<00:03:11.400> mode<00:03:11.580> in<00:03:11.760> object<00:03:12.150> mode

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
different from edit mode in object mode

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.880 
different from edit mode in object mode
won't<00:03:14.730> discuss<00:03:15.060> that<00:03:15.090> later<00:03:15.270> and<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:16.740> move

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
won't discuss that later and to move

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.150 
won't discuss that later and to move
this<00:03:17.130> around<00:03:17.330> all<00:03:18.330> you<00:03:18.420> have<00:03:18.510> to<00:03:18.600> do<00:03:18.720> is<00:03:18.870> hit

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
this around all you have to do is hit

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.449 
this around all you have to do is hit
the<00:03:20.160> G<00:03:20.430> key<00:03:20.730> and<00:03:21.410> this<00:03:22.410> will<00:03:22.620> move<00:03:22.950> it<00:03:23.160> the

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
the G key and this will move it the

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.420 
the G key and this will move it the
object<00:03:23.880> around<00:03:24.120> in<00:03:24.420> your<00:03:24.750> view<00:03:25.200> that's<00:03:26.160> not

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
object around in your view that's not

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.820 
object around in your view that's not
very<00:03:26.700> accurate<00:03:27.060> if<00:03:27.600> we're<00:03:27.930> trying<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.530> put<00:03:28.680> it

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
very accurate if we're trying to put it

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.620 
very accurate if we're trying to put it
somewhere<00:03:30.410> like<00:03:31.760> you<00:03:32.760> know<00:03:32.880> we<00:03:33.180> don't<00:03:33.360> want<00:03:33.540> to

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
somewhere like you know we don't want to

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.890 
somewhere like you know we don't want to
do<00:03:33.750> this<00:03:33.900> for<00:03:34.410> position<00:03:35.120> because<00:03:36.120> it's<00:03:36.150> just

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
do this for position because it's just

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.760 
do this for position because it's just
putting<00:03:37.350> it<00:03:37.410> off<00:03:37.560> into<00:03:37.860> a<00:03:37.890> random<00:03:38.220> location

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
putting it off into a random location

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.270 
putting it off into a random location
okay<00:03:40.770> so<00:03:41.190> so<00:03:42.060> G<00:03:42.330> key<00:03:42.570> and<00:03:42.840> then<00:03:43.770> that'll<00:03:44.160> move

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
okay so so G key and then that'll move

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.120 
okay so so G key and then that'll move
it<00:03:44.430> around<00:03:44.520> g4<00:03:45.330> graph<00:03:48.560> now<00:03:49.560> what<00:03:49.739> we<00:03:49.860> need<00:03:49.920> to

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
it around g4 graph now what we need to

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.640 
it around g4 graph now what we need to
do<00:03:50.280> is<00:03:50.520> talk<00:03:51.180> about<00:03:51.209> how<00:03:51.450> to<00:03:51.660> constraint<00:03:52.350> your

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
do is talk about how to constraint your

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.150 
do is talk about how to constraint your
movement<00:03:53.130> ok<00:03:53.940> so<00:03:54.120> up<00:03:54.660> on<00:03:55.050> this<00:03:55.530> will<00:03:55.800> move<00:03:55.950> it

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
movement ok so up on this will move it

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.270 
movement ok so up on this will move it
so<00:03:56.790> right<00:03:57.690> here<00:03:57.959> we<00:03:58.200> have<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:58.650> blue<00:03:58.950> which<00:03:59.250> is

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
so right here we have the blue which is

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.590 
so right here we have the blue which is
the<00:04:00.000> z<00:04:00.239> axis<00:04:00.770> this<00:04:01.770> this<00:04:02.280> um<00:04:02.520> symbol<00:04:03.450> right

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
the z axis this this um symbol right

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.920 
the z axis this this um symbol right
here<00:04:03.660> with<00:04:04.230> these<00:04:04.440> three<00:04:05.040> x<00:04:05.340> y&amp;z<00:04:05.970> when<00:04:06.600> we<00:04:06.720> move

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
here with these three x y&amp;z when we move

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.990 
here with these three x y&amp;z when we move
around<00:04:07.230> and<00:04:07.440> it<00:04:07.530> tells<00:04:07.709> us<00:04:07.950> where<00:04:08.400> we<00:04:08.550> load<00:04:08.700> or

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
around and it tells us where we load or

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.870 
around and it tells us where we load or
our<00:04:09.239> location<00:04:09.780> is<00:04:09.900> for<00:04:10.110> our<00:04:10.230> view<00:04:10.790> kind<00:04:11.790> of

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
our location is for our view kind of

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.759 
our location is for our view kind of
confusing<00:04:12.360> but<00:04:12.570> you'll<00:04:13.170> understand<00:04:13.530> as<00:04:13.650> you

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
confusing but you'll understand as you

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.610 
confusing but you'll understand as you
begin<00:04:13.980> to<00:04:14.040> use<00:04:14.220> it<00:04:14.370> more<00:04:15.080> alright<00:04:16.080> so<00:04:16.260> hit<00:04:16.470> this

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
begin to use it more alright so hit this

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.229 
begin to use it more alright so hit this
blue<00:04:16.950> arrow<00:04:17.190> this<00:04:17.430> will<00:04:17.609> constraint<00:04:18.060> it

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
blue arrow this will constraint it

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.710 
blue arrow this will constraint it
against<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:18.840> z<00:04:19.049> axis<00:04:19.080> and<00:04:19.799> then<00:04:20.700> in<00:04:21.090> the<00:04:21.450> green

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
against the z axis and then in the green

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.200 
against the z axis and then in the green
for<00:04:22.109> y

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
for y

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.610 
for y
read<00:04:24.630> for<00:04:24.930> X<00:04:25.970> alright<00:04:26.970> so<00:04:27.870> that's<00:04:28.020> moving<00:04:28.350> our

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
read for X alright so that's moving our

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.670 
read for X alright so that's moving our
objects<00:04:29.100> around<00:04:29.270> now<00:04:30.270> this<00:04:30.509> is<00:04:30.660> just<00:04:30.690> moving

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
objects around now this is just moving

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.629 
objects around now this is just moving
up<00:04:31.979> down<00:04:32.250> and<00:04:32.990> left<00:04:33.990> or<00:04:34.169> right<00:04:34.460> what<00:04:35.460> if<00:04:35.550> we

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
up down and left or right what if we

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.219 
up down and left or right what if we
want<00:04:35.819> to<00:04:35.880> rotate<00:04:36.030> it<00:04:36.389> will<00:04:36.569> all<00:04:36.810> we<00:04:36.960> have<00:04:37.050> to<00:04:37.139> do

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
want to rotate it will all we have to do

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.640 
want to rotate it will all we have to do
is<00:04:37.259> hit<00:04:37.380> the<00:04:37.590> RT<00:04:38.039> r<00:04:38.669> ki<00:04:39.000> will<00:04:39.240> rotate<00:04:39.660> it<00:04:39.810> we're

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
is hit the RT r ki will rotate it we're

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.439 
is hit the RT r ki will rotate it we're
noticing<00:04:40.919> how<00:04:41.220> it<00:04:41.400> rotates<00:04:41.699> in<00:04:42.210> a<00:04:42.300> very

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:42.449 
noticing how it rotates in a very

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:45.200 
noticing how it rotates in a very
awkward<00:04:42.660> position<00:04:43.400> so<00:04:44.400> what<00:04:44.699> we<00:04:44.819> need<00:04:44.970> to<00:04:45.030> do

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
awkward position so what we need to do

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.659 
awkward position so what we need to do
is<00:04:45.330> hit<00:04:45.860> 30<00:04:46.860> yeah<00:04:47.580> 3<00:04:47.970> 4<00:04:48.840> side<00:04:49.050> view<00:04:49.349> shift<00:04:50.340> over

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
is hit 30 yeah 3 4 side view shift over

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.029 
is hit 30 yeah 3 4 side view shift over
to<00:04:50.759> where<00:04:50.849> you<00:04:50.940> can<00:04:51.060> see<00:04:51.210> and<00:04:51.449> are<00:04:52.229> this<00:04:52.889> will

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
to where you can see and are this will

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:56.719 
to where you can see and are this will
rotate<00:04:53.190> it<00:04:54.050> along<00:04:55.050> a<00:04:55.080> more<00:04:55.319> act<00:04:55.530> more<00:04:56.280> accurate

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
rotate it along a more act more accurate

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:59.930 
rotate it along a more act more accurate
position<00:04:57.300> see<00:04:58.050> this<00:04:58.410> British<00:04:58.949> rotates<00:04:59.370> it<00:04:59.550> the

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
position see this British rotates it the

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.879 
position see this British rotates it the
direction<00:05:00.210> and<00:05:00.419> we're<00:05:00.509> looking<00:05:00.630> at<00:05:00.930> it<00:05:01.080> but<00:05:01.770> if

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
direction and we're looking at it but if

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:03.740 
direction and we're looking at it but if
we're<00:05:02.009> looking<00:05:02.190> at<00:05:02.310> directly<00:05:02.849> from<00:05:03.000> side<00:05:03.449> view

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
we're looking at directly from side view

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.950 
we're looking at directly from side view
that<00:05:04.500> will<00:05:04.620> rotate<00:05:04.979> it<00:05:05.160> around<00:05:05.509> around<00:05:06.509> more

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
that will rotate it around around more

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.260 
that will rotate it around around more
accurate<00:05:07.759> um<00:05:09.949> you<00:05:10.949> can<00:05:11.190> use<00:05:11.430> this<00:05:11.699> right<00:05:12.090> here

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
accurate um you can use this right here

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.629 
accurate um you can use this right here
these<00:05:12.539> three<00:05:12.930> buttons<00:05:13.110> the<00:05:13.710> triangle<00:05:14.490> circle

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
these three buttons the triangle circle

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:18.379 
these three buttons the triangle circle
and<00:05:14.970> square<00:05:15.300> to<00:05:16.130> change<00:05:17.130> this<00:05:17.370> as<00:05:17.909> though<00:05:18.090> this

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:18.389 
and square to change this as though this

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:20.930 
and square to change this as though this
is<00:05:18.570> what<00:05:18.720> I<00:05:18.750> mean<00:05:19.020> see<00:05:19.800> if<00:05:19.889> we<00:05:20.039> hit<00:05:20.159> the<00:05:20.310> arky<00:05:20.729> it

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
is what I mean see if we hit the arky it

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.760 
is what I mean see if we hit the arky it
rotates<00:05:21.360> in<00:05:21.479> this<00:05:21.630> direction<00:05:21.690> and<00:05:22.289> that's<00:05:22.620> not

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
rotates in this direction and that's not

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.820 
rotates in this direction and that's not
very<00:05:22.889> accurate<00:05:23.159> along<00:05:23.610> the<00:05:23.789> x<00:05:23.940> y&amp;z<00:05:24.389> axis

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
very accurate along the x y&amp;z axis

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.270 
very accurate along the x y&amp;z axis
constraint<00:05:25.830> we<00:05:26.069> can<00:05:26.220> do<00:05:26.310> this<00:05:27.199> and<00:05:28.199> so<00:05:28.470> on<00:05:28.590> and

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280

editing the way it looks like scaling it

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.379 
editing the way it looks like scaling it
start<00:05:40.560> like<00:05:40.680> that<00:05:40.889> you<00:05:41.759> don't<00:05:41.909> really<00:05:42.000> have<00:05:42.330> to

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
start like that you don't really have to

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:45.469 
start like that you don't really have to
use<00:05:42.659> this<00:05:43.039> right<00:05:44.039> now<00:05:44.280> just<00:05:45.030> learning<00:05:45.389> the

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
use this right now just learning the

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:48.980 
use this right now just learning the
interface<00:05:45.870> because<00:05:46.400> um<00:05:47.400> that<00:05:48.389> doesn't<00:05:48.659> you

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
interface because um that doesn't you

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.719 
interface because um that doesn't you
don't<00:05:49.020> really<00:05:49.289> need<00:05:49.469> to<00:05:49.590> learn<00:05:49.740> it<00:05:49.919> until

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
don't really need to learn it until

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:52.939 
don't really need to learn it until
