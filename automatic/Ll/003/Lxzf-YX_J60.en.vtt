00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
motion Las Vegas I just like to give you

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.290 
motion Las Vegas I just like to give you
guys<00:00:06.960> a<00:00:06.990> review<00:00:07.259> on<00:00:07.770> our<00:00:07.940> twisted<00:00:08.940> motion

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
guys a review on our twisted motion

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.690 
guys a review on our twisted motion
Edition<00:00:09.750> GT<00:00:10.400> 2871<00:00:11.400> are<00:00:12.080> turbo<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.769> I<00:00:14.400> like<00:00:14.549> to

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
Edition GT 2871 are turbo and I like to

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.880 
Edition GT 2871 are turbo and I like to
show<00:00:14.880> you<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.089> differences<00:00:15.570> between<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:16.170> t25

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
show you the differences between the t25

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.880 
show you the differences between the t25
and<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.760> t28<00:00:18.270> turbo<00:00:18.810> that<00:00:19.590> we<00:00:19.770> make<00:00:21.890> basically

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
and the t28 turbo that we make basically

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.769 
and the t28 turbo that we make basically
you<00:00:22.980> can<00:00:23.130> see<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.400> obvious<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.359> turbo

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
you can see the obvious that the turbo

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.620 
you can see the obvious that the turbo
is<00:00:25.019> quite<00:00:25.439> larger<00:00:26.070> than<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.400> t25<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.359> left

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
is quite larger than the t25 to the left

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.330 
is quite larger than the t25 to the left
and<00:00:28.400> that<00:00:29.400> we<00:00:29.519> had<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.939> actually<00:00:30.199> clock<00:00:31.340> the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
and that we had to actually clock the

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.889 
and that we had to actually clock the
intake<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.030> turbo<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.690> right<00:00:33.870> a

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
intake of the turbo to the right a

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.940 
intake of the turbo to the right a
little<00:00:34.200> bit<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:35.010> compensate<00:00:35.219> for<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.850> size

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
little bit to compensate for the size

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.160 
little bit to compensate for the size
and<00:00:37.950> if<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.730> guys<00:00:38.879> are<00:00:39.149> running<00:00:39.300> AC<00:00:39.690> you're

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
and if you guys are running AC you're

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.350 
and if you guys are running AC you're
gonna<00:00:40.320> have<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.800> have<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:41.250> intake<00:00:42.030> pipe

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
gonna have to have this intake pipe

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.290 
gonna have to have this intake pipe
actually<00:00:42.780> cut<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.500> REE<00:00:44.219> clocked<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.910> little<00:00:45.180> to

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
actually cut and REE clocked a little to

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.720 
actually cut and REE clocked a little to
the<00:00:45.420> left<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:46.260> angle<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.680> up<00:00:46.860> more<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.489> this

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
the left to angle it up more so this

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.900 
the left to angle it up more so this
matches<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.450> same<00:00:48.690> side<00:00:49.550> basic<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.670> just<00:00:50.789> want

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
matches the same side basic I just want

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.430 
matches the same side basic I just want
to<00:00:51.000> show<00:00:51.120> everybody<00:00:51.390> like<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.899> differences

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
to show everybody like the differences

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.930 
to show everybody like the differences
because<00:00:52.649> everyone's<00:00:52.920> asking<00:00:53.100> on<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.550> forums

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
because everyone's asking on the forums

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.000 
because everyone's asking on the forums
and<00:00:54.180> stuff<00:00:54.239> want<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.780> know<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.440> turbo<00:00:55.890> is

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
and stuff want to know this turbo is

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.189 
and stuff want to know this turbo is
actually<00:00:56.460> made<00:00:56.640> in<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.820> USA<00:00:57.329> it's<00:00:57.690> actually

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
actually made in the USA it's actually

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.029 
actually made in the USA it's actually
stage<00:00:58.590> 3<00:00:58.920> balance<00:00:59.399> on<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.609> machine<00:01:00.620> 11,000<00:01:01.620> rpm

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
stage 3 balance on a machine 11,000 rpm

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.149 
stage 3 balance on a machine 11,000 rpm
balancing<00:01:03.320> you<00:01:04.320> can<00:01:04.470> tell<00:01:04.650> from<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.949> little

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
balancing you can tell from the little

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.480 
balancing you can tell from the little
t25<00:01:05.850> it's<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.450> lot<00:01:06.630> smaller<00:01:07.280> compared<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.340> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
t25 it's a lot smaller compared to the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.800 
t25 it's a lot smaller compared to the
GT<00:01:09.180> 27r<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.799> we<00:01:10.890> actually<00:01:11.070> had<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.580> extend<00:01:12.090> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
GT 27r and we actually had to extend the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.060 
GT 27r and we actually had to extend the
wastegate<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.710> actually

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
wastegate and this is actually

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.980 
wastegate and this is actually
adjustable<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.880> can<00:01:14.970> adjust<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.659> boost

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
adjustable so you can adjust the boost

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.640 
adjustable so you can adjust the boost
whatever<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:17.040> want<00:01:18.320> with<00:01:19.320> just<00:01:19.470> this

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
whatever you want with just this

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.399 
whatever you want with just this
adjustment<00:01:20.280> screw<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:21.049> raise<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.229> boost

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
adjustment screw and raise the boost

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.690 
adjustment screw and raise the boost
without<00:01:22.650> actually<00:01:22.950> having<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.220> buy<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.400> boost

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
without actually having to buy a boost

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:31.219 
without actually having to buy a boost
controller<00:01:26.030> you<00:01:27.030> can<00:01:27.119> see<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.509> stock<00:01:27.840> t25<00:01:30.229> and

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
controller you can see the stock t25 and

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.890 
controller you can see the stock t25 and
then<00:01:31.409> here's<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.740> GT<00:01:32.549> 27<00:01:33.240> are<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.600> wheel<00:01:33.750> is

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
then here's the GT 27 are the wheel is

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.580 
then here's the GT 27 are the wheel is
actually<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.259> lot<00:01:34.470> larger<00:01:34.909> on<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.360> then<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.810> t25

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
actually a lot larger on it then the t25

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.330 
actually a lot larger on it then the t25
and<00:01:38.369> has<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.880> billet<00:01:39.360> flat<00:01:39.659> put<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.189> it's<00:01:41.189> going

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
and has a billet flat put in it's going

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.270 
and has a billet flat put in it's going
to<00:01:41.400> handle<00:01:41.520> more<00:01:41.790> heat
