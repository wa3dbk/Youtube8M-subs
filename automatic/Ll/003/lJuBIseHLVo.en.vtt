00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.570
 content then you will create a 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.119
 relevant content is provided that you 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.719
 notice if several people are doing 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.520
 that same question for example if 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:01.079
 five or ten people depending on the 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.570
 size of your audience are 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.610
 asking this question for sure is a 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.090
 relevant subject then you will 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.400
 write an article or create videos with 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.110
 this content answers that question 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.470
 and for sure you will create relevance 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.629
 on google for example and also go it 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.980
 people will read your article will 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.680
 find it very interesting that it is a 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.510
 relevant subject and will share in 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.610
 social networks then you will increase 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.010
 your audience in various ways 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.760
 ok then the second way to increase the 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.409
 the audience of your site or blog are you 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.500
 would need a mailing list is 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:40.079
 A little more advanced and it would be you are 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.849
 send to your mailing list at 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.400
 question you ask what your 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:47.010
 audience would like to know for example 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.920
 canine behavior you ask 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.019
 just look I wrote this 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.269
 article on canine behavior and 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.760
 Now I 'd like to know what you 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:59.340
 Want To Know About Dog Training 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.109
 on canine behavior is to respond 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.450
 this email message with your question 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:05.730
 I'll try to answer in a next 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.280
 opportunity in an article the video you 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.549
 will do according to the content that 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.109
 Do you prefer to do then this? 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.939
 way then a way a little more 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.889
 advanced if you have a mailing list 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:19.109
 very large for example you have 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:21.449
 thousands of subscribers 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:24.269
 so you can also send it to your 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:26.190
 list a survey you do three ale 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.470
 questions you put in the form of the 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.629
 google docs lord monkees are 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.829
 free tools for you to do 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:33.510
 search 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.760
 So you're going to ask three questions. 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.280
 about are you going to ask about the three 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.389
 topics which top these topics you 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.609
 prefers 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:43.919
 and you would like me to address it in my 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:46.049
 blog and then at the end you leave a 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:47.970
 blank field to fill person 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.310
 would be the other field then the person will 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.190
 ask a specific question there 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.340
 You still do not ask, then you 're the one? 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.199
 Same thing 5 10 people depending on 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.909
 size of your audience did the same 

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:02.370
 question you can know it is a 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:04.650
 relevant topic that if you put in the 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.780
 your blog you will have more traffic 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.519
 organic people will like it but your 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.440
 content of your content will 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:13.620
 share on social networks at last 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.049
 you will generate more audience as well and 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.870
 now a third way to increase 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.000
 your site's audience are you 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.740
 encourage your visitors to do 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.349
 a search within your site 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.030
 you'll put a search field 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:30.669
 person to research on another subject 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.069
 besides your site the person will search 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.930
 if she finds out about it 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:36.940
 which she searched within your site 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.550
 she will stay longer in your 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.169
 so this is going to be good because 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.550
 your site will become more relevant in 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.830
 google why google it counts too 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.349
 the time that the person stays in their 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.810
 site it benefits over these sites and 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:51.940
 puts more at the top of the searches 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.130
 and also you will see that it is as if you 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:57.849
 had slowed the minds of his 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:00.370
 visitors to taci several people five 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:02.229
 ten fifteen people search 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.030
 about that topic then you can 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:06.490
 know that if you create an article 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.930
 talking about that topic you go 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.490
 increase your audience of several 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.560
 manners to person 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.780
 people will search your blog 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.810
 will stay longer than your blog is 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.759
 the people they will come from other fifa 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.639
 from google for example from other sources 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:23.530
 of people's traffic will share 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:25.990
