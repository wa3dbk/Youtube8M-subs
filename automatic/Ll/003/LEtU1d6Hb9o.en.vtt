00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.430
 no 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.650
 hi guys i'm down that i run the 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.470
 website life.com set my ticket 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.230
 interrail in April 2014 that I have 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.730
 made four European stages 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.530
 I made the backpack without knowing that 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.309
 that I should have expected and am 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.900
 party 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.690
 It was a fantastic trip to 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.780
 solitary in which I saw budapest 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.220
 berlin amsterdam paris and then i am 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.170
 returned directly to Milan for 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.730
 come back to my house since I am 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.710
 starting again in a couple of 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.600
 weeks for this adventure 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.519
 I took a look look found 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.199
 no video explaining what inter is 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:01.210
 rail and maybe some experience I have 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.339
 wanted to create a video for 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.010
 share with you my experience a 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:09.130
 briefly explain what the internet is 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.270
 we see immediately first of all we need to 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.060
 buy your ticket 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.530
 interrail with an official outcome is a 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.680
 ticket that allows you to take 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.540
 any European train in those ne 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.189
 immediately understood in the map in 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.180
 some cases you have to pay a small one 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.490
 extra 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.890
 in high-speed trains or to 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.670
 notice them before there are different types 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.250
 of pass 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:34.149
 if then it will come five days out of 10 10 up 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.280
 20 25 15 consecutive days and put two 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:39.759
 consecutive or a consecutive month 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.710
 I recommend the one in which it allows you 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.689
 to travel five days out of 10 or 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.780
 ten days out of 22 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:48.700
 for what reason to give each city the 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.009
 its time maybe stop me but every stage 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.869
 two days and then leave at 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.600
 run away next 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.880
 this is your interrail e ticket 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.159
 this part must be completed every 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.100
 once you take the train 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:07.360
 I bought 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.970
 the 55 days out of 10 pass he has 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.709
 allowed to visit one city every two 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.640
 days and then leave for that 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.290
 next one 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.120
 The time has come to understand with whom 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.520
 to leave I have made this journey into 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.470
 lonely to understand how they work 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.440
 within and to have freedom of 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.780
 move without having any constraint o 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.700
 have another person tell me if 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.890
 let's go there or my advice 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.720
 definitely leave in the company 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.670
 there are many people who leave perhaps 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.950
 the group from 10 a group of 8 from 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.170
 fourteen people but an ideal e 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.830
 starting with just three or four people 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.900
 to enjoy this journey without being able to 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.610
 it depends on anyone if you want to go to 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.470
 a part you don't have to wait 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.660
 necessarily the whole group is there 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.580
 in too many it is hard to take some 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.280
 decisions because someone maybe 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.630
 would like to take the five o'clock train 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.090
 in the afternoon instead of that of 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.620
 morning or maybe he wakes up late 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:05.830
 this type then my advice of 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:07.420
 leave giuseppe three or four cities 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.579
 there are many to visit to work 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.019
 tips of the preferred stops by 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.910
 people who have undertaken this 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.220
 experience I found a site indeed 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.650
 interesting that I put indiscretion 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.510
 which allows you to organize yours 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.209
 Stages from trip agitates in order to 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.910
 organize yourself and make decisions too 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.840
 where to sleep where to start and where 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.910
 conclude the deal 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.709
 at this point we need to understand the city 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.590
 starting point of your ticket 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.170
 interrail and validity once that 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.510
 buy your interrail ticket 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.850
 obviously I will be asked for the date of 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:44.530
 validity 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:46.750
 obviously I chose it from 14.5 e 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.510
 expires after ten days then to you vi 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.970
 will be asked is the city not exactly 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.790
 cites the date on which you want the 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.410
 ticket speaks and is not valid for the 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.600
 country of residence therefore for 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.359
 you may need to reach the first stop 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.549
 pay for the train or my own figures 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:06.069
 I therefore advise you to leave two days 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.640
 before the first of the validity of 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.590
 boss 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.349
 ticket let's take an example if the 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.330
 your ticket starts from 20 November e 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:17.269
 shots after ten days I recommend you 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:20.299
 leave maybe 17 and reach that one 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:23.510
 perhaps the three days stop in spain 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:26.210
 first two days before so you can 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:29.570
 use those two days in that 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.610
 city ​​in that country if then the 20 far 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.870
 leave your ticket to leave 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.340
 for the next stop 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.030
 this is also valid for the return 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:41.389
 so on return you don't have to pay or the 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.020
 train or plane in the country of 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.210
 residence 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.680
 you can take the train and pay on the 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.260
 territory of residence 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.630
 maybe a discounted rate for those at 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:54.290
 disney's or to do as in the beginning 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:58.400
 take a bus from the final city of 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:00.530
 your interrail and take the flight to 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.510
 your country of residence where 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.880
 sleeping this is the simplest step 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.310
 of your journey the terrain can be 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.100
 use websites as your bucher 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:13.539
 or world host to book the 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:16.910
 your hotel or cheap gold stars 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:18.530
 and save during your trip 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.840
 obviously I advise you to leave e 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:24.289
 book the mama also continue with 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.450
 the stages so as not to have any 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:28.729
 if you add maybe budapest and you want 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.320
 go berlin to book one goes because 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.570
 arrived in budapest for the stage 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.120
 next in this way if you want 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.950
 maybe stop in budapest and maybe 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.660
 a few more days or there is not 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.990
 liked the city so stop by 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:44.419
 less you can book and the lost without 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.250
 have constraints maybe to go 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:48.620
 precisely that day as I did 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.900
 very good indiscretion I leave you these 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.760
 two websites that I mentioned that I use 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.710
 main in technical when I move is 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.780
 found everything in the description in 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.110
 description I also leave you and the sites 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.670
 web that I mentioned in order to download 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.290
 it is not free which allows you to 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:04.150
 book when you are maybe 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.980
 hostels and is ready for the stage 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.790
 next as all the hostels 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.040
 all 2 tel 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.300
 I speak free wifi before concluding 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.150
 video I advise you to download 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.070
 the official interrail application and that 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.200
 it also works without the internet there 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.970
 allows you to see all the schedules of the 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.710
 trains I have to say with a lot of application 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.570
 useful that helped me organize 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.400

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.930
