00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.800
 do not 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.020
 I am daisy and welcome to my channel and 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.779
 ccoo days and we are going to prepare our 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.119
 macerated carrot for people 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.510
 They have it ready so I'm going to 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:31.140
 explain what oil is for 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.680
 carrot for being carrot for its 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.470
 high vitamin content is an oil 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.640
 that helps us regenerate our skin to 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.809
 prevent wrinkles 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:49.239
 and also for skin problems like 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:52.090
 acne eczema psoriasis is not something that 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:55.900
 go to cure them but it will improve 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.170
 much skin condition for 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.930
 we want to prevent wrinkles 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.560
 because this oil is used a little diluted 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:09.210
 and if it is used pure you should not use all 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.190
 the days because by the fact of catching 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:17.259
 this orange color look how it has 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:19.390
 I left my macerated well naranjita 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:22.600
 because I 've put it twice to that 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.220
 the carrots I had previously and 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.340
 I put back but carrot 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:30.420
 dehydrated 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.070
 and as I said, it is an oil that 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.350
 for the fact of being very concentrated we 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.979
 It can color the skin and it will put us 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.590
 a little yellow also the oil is 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.170
 very good when there are sunburn or 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.539
 any other type of burns help 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.149
 to heal and regenerate skin 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:50.369
 tissues well now let's see how 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.250
 We are going to prepare our oil and how 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.340
 let's do it also to mix it 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.399
 with other skin oils for 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.250
 who do not know how to dehydrate my 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.039
 carrots and tell what I have a 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.590
 dehydrator this is my dehydration 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:10.920
 dehydrator here this each ones 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:15.020
 rose petals taking advantage of the time of 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.840
 roses and also some nettles 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.900
 little by little I will teach you how 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.750
 we can go using different herbs myself 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.030
 in the summer he took advantage of dehydrating 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.790
 everything that is put in front of me that I know 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.460
 which can be used for both 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.480
 skin as for good health we have 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.850
 our oil 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.130
 and carrot 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.490
 as I say so it looks good 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.950
 Concentrates can be put twice 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.760
 leaves a week sneaks the first 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.500
 carrots and then another week more and it 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.900
 I 'm sorry, sorry 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.930
 another week more with another one 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.730
 new carrots as I said in this 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.520
 so I used my carrots 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.040
 dehydrated 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.210
 and I like I 'm recycling all the 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:09.130
 possible jars 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.130
 let's put so they can see well 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:21.890
 this little bottle was a bottle that was 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:26.700
 I made the lid has appeared the lid 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:29.700
 it was a jar of honey here is the lid 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.849
 this was a jar of honey then by 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.550
 the fact of having an opening that has 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.950
 the gummie so it does not spill so much 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.500
 oil and how will I use it to 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.120
 the body also helps maintain the 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.870
 tan for those who like 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:49.380
 tan but in my case I neither sun nor 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:53.130
 nothing I prefer to be white faded 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:57.300
 but without wrinkles or skin problems 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:04:01.520
 now let's put a colander and let's 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.520
 strain the sentence that 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:10.750
 this smells like pure carrot 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.750
 and look what color cuter 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.370
 I will not finish casting all because 

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:21.470
 I think it's going to be too much and this 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:25.940
 preference if they want it to last longer 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:28.000
 time they put it in the fridge or whatever 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.930
 leave in one place 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.930
 cool 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:36.870
 dry to prevent it from picking mushrooms 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.689
 and another important thing is that I put 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.449
 the date of when you were bagged so that 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:46.379
 do not forget them and also if this has 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:48.900
 bad smell or they see some fungus because they no longer 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:52.139
 reuse because it can be more 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.810
 dangerous to the skin if you have any 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.600
 bacterium 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.900
 so this is carrot oil 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:02.690
 as I say this you can use it in the 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:07.100
 day and at night this does not happen anything like 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:08.900
 in the case of citrus oils this 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.930
 on the contrary it helps us protect the 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.600
 skin especially today in the time it does 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.600
 more good sun also in the winter 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:20.570
 to prevent dry skin and 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:24.440
 Cracks in the skin this oil is very 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:27.200
 good for those kinds of conditions and 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:30.290
 especially in the winter when we were 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.930
 It dries a lot because of the cold too 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.270
 good to put it on your lips like that 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.940
 that as far as possible 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:41.270
 I will teach how I use it in my 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:43.700
 good friends mixes 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.570
 it's been all for today and we'll see you in the 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.570
 next video
