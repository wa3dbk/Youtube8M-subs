00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.000
 hello everyone and welcome to the retro 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.639
 of the trainer okay today I'm talking the 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.590
 section is the pokemon random block and 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.849
 good for riding stock people 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.529
 in block always after throwing what is 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.750
 a light which means more people than what 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.570
 know for the people who place it is 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.070
 a world that is a series of rules ado 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.260
 posed by the powers of pokemon 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.520
 to make it any or 7 little more 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.140
 hard to get over 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.000
 that is, they are norms that the 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.190
 people already create the pokemon players 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.780
 for any shopping game because 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.160
 We have red for x with emeralds for 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.840
 any pokemon game in the series 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.650
 principal you want to do it more 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:47.409
 difficult with a good set of rules 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.059
 these rules have been created 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:52.360
 as I say by several players in the world 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.280
 and it has two very basic rules that 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.589
 have to always meet to be a 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.970
 block that are the following the first 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.100
 is that when a Pokémon falls defeated 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.140
 is considered dead and it has to be 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.989
 released so for example if we have 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.360
 we world pizzi and we are weakened 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.920
 with a thunder for example it is epic 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.220
 we can play it pokemon centers 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.690
 but we should leave it on the pc or 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.370
 let go of releasing it 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.050
 to not have it because the pokemon is 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.630
 considered dead is to say that no longer 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:23.830
 we can play with him never again and 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.370
 Somehow we've all lost 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.160
 game and it's over 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.750
 that is the most important minor of all 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.730
 the block and then there 's the second 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.650
 also mandatory and is that the player 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.870
 must catch only the first 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.340
 pokemon to appear in each area and only 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.350
 one and the first one that is yes 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.840
 we found in the beta 1 of red pokemon 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.580
 for example a pitch and this one always 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.700
 escape 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.820
 we noticed it because we do not know anything else 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.130
 if for example we find a pitch but 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.450
 We believe for a while and good for killing the 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.430
 pinches to consider it is therefore not 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.800
 we can do this since we assume that 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.780
 we have found has been cliche and we 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.300
 we are with pizzi or we can not capture 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.610
 no pokemon more than route 1 so 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.770
 well then there are other rules that are not 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.960
 obligatory but if each person can 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.880
 give us to customize let's say that the 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.280
 person can modify these new and 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.560
 clear what you want and well there are some 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.940
 standards such as limit the use 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.920
 of the pokemon centers can not be 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.020
 take care of other pokemon for example or 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.610
 also with the ovulation cases of not 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.730
 you can use do speculation like 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:29.099
 for example the most portion or things like that 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.650
 but good as I tell you this is not a 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:34.200
 world that normal is going in block and 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:38.909
 why is it called random block because in 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:41.310
 this now I will explain the rules that 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:43.920
 I will use myself in this block as 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.930
 it said the first is that the pokemon 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.090
 enabled are dead so when 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.220
 a little weaken us this little bit is going to 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.569
 be released I personally will leave 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.120
 the special because they arm me where to 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.610
 jump we put them to take more than 4 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.670
 Pokemon have died at the end of the video 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.170
 and good when the pokemon weakens 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.310
 it is considered dead and until then 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.709
 we can never touch it again 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.569
 then the second rule is that as I said 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.819
 only to capture the common body 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.410
 from the area so if we do not have it could 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.630
 because of the lags, we get annoyed 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.849
 mobile the pokemon will die we can not 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.849
 do nothing and even there we wait 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.590
 then then abnormal that you're 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.569
 equate raised is that all the 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.239
 pokémon that we catch must have mounts 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.520
 that is to say that basically we put 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.930
 votes for the pokemon to have a 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.360
 kind of link with us let's say 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.220
 because if they do not have a name, I have the 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.170
 to be killed in a certain way but 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.910
 alter the mold, yes, it is clear how we 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.830
 put mentally the pokemon and and the 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.209
 coach and ladies but will loose a bit 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.180
 with that death that a little that 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.709
 I was pricked so how do you put here the 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.660
 we can are not just data are our 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.540
 friends and if they die by we'll wait for 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.459
 always and good then as I told you 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.840
 fourth standard this is not a pokémon the 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.420
 blocks in the juice that showing a 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.650
 block and because he knew that riding 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.709
 blocks because all because with that 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.970
 appear on the grass will be 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.950
 modified that is to say they are going to appear 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.950
 oratory mind for example if we played 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.390
 to pokemon elmer when giving in the first 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.010
 route is not going to look like a zigzag and 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.870
 wordpress but it may appear 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.760
 any kind of pokemon from bull 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.320
 trash up art because it's fourth 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.060
 generation because riding is possible 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.829
 I know how I'm going to play is fourth 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.840
 generation as well as you find 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:26.220
 any pokemon from playing to art 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:29.430
 400 large strips and like this more 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.230
 Well, the fourth norm that I propose for 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.820
 this random block is that we will catch 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.830
 the evolved pokemon that appears 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.810
 in the grass is to say if for example we 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.940
 we put in the grass of little that appears 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.020
 it is an exploit because this because 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.610
 will have another group that although 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.770
 let's find since it is evolved and 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.720
 I will not treat it because if we go to 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.260
 happen with an exploded with u2 for example 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.220
 it will be very easy so only 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.470
 we will tell that the command itself that 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.420
 we found the grass will be the time 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.070
 how oslo pokemon has not evolved 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.640
 do not have evolution for example carnival 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.640
 and not for example 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:06.189
 when they are small I thought first 

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:06.189
 generation issue for example 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.270
 and as I tell you, it looks like a pokémon 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.560
 evolved as a minute and so on 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.690
 new keep in mind and you can not 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.750
 catch for nothing and disregard 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.430
 it's already good those are the four rules 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.470
 main ones that have me because 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.320
 showing a block as I tell you I'm going 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.850
 to do because with silver soulsilver and os 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.280
 you ask any devotee with silver 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:30.070
 basically serves because because with 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:34.260
 silver was my favorite game and it continues 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:36.520
 being true my favorite as well as already 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.380
 I also said that I liked it a lot 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.090
 the black 2 but as you have already done was 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.580
 ice as black 2 normal seems to me very 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.169
 fool to be able to do the guide again of 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.150
 black pokémon 2 but little by little 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:47.560
 showing so I bring you some things 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.450
 new that is fourth generation but 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.660
 what tests like to be because showing 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:55.060
 a block of silver pokemon soulsilver and 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.200
 well this these videos and uploading all 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.340
 on Wednesdays and every Saturday in 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.830
 principle if I have no problem 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.360
 so you will have double chapter each 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.790
 week you can see it every Wednesday and 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.350
 every Saturday and good in principle and that 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.580
 it's all I hope you like it a lot 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:09.669
 idea of why we have given block 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.830
 anything you want to contribute 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:14.610
 comments to talk about it and so on 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.610
 and good I say goodbye 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.320
 And until next time
