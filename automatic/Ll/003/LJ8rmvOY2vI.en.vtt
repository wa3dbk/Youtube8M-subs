 filming in full hd 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.880
 here we have the most common types 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.239

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:36.090
 most common cards nowadays this msd 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.430
 which is for compact camera phone 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.470

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.960
 compact flash than the cameras 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:46.350
 from the beginning of the 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.730
 digital cameras here or memory stick of the 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.570

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.920
 an ordinary card also these martin 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.530
 media is also not common and this escape 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.520
 which is also not common for us here 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.579
 common are this is cds and mini sd and usb and 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:10.170
 if memory stick from sony here right? 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:12.720
 I'll tell you about the sd oecd card here . 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.800
 sell digital sic né 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.600
 and it has three sizes that card has this 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.909
 which is the normal one that we use in the 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.830
 dslr cameras nowadays on the cameras 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:28.860
 compact DSLR use this type here this 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.619
 mini some cameras use it and this one 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.140
 usually a cell phone that 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.040
 use this one here or some cameras 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.670
 Also right compact O O O O common to 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:45.090
 see this micro and this is the normal sd here 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.479
 here are the compactflash of the cameras 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.960
 dslr also that are some of the most 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:55.409
 used and are very quick too right 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.080
 nowadays this sd is a pretty card 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.380
 fast but this compactflash is also 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.080
 quite fast he is quick to be able to 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.970
 record on top of it and fast to 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.030
 download also 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.849
 I 'm here on the sbd page and they 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.730
 show the cards here or even 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.670
 the common sd 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:20.569
 and the types of signals that have neither time 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.900
 for normal card speed today 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:27.709
 in day is the 10 here but he has these 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.379
 classes here to class 2 4 6 and 10 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.989
 this class number indicating the 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:35.330
 minimum speed in megabytes per 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.459
 according to what he can record for 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.610
 if recording in full hd 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:44.150
 nowadays there are cameras dslr the card 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:47.720
 have to at least placidity that other 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:51.440
 type of class that is the one that has and 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:54.049
 heat in the middle are the fastest cards 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.299
 that you have in the market neither and suddenly 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.879
 thus depending on the camera or need 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:02.090
 to be that type of card is not that card 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:06.709
 fits cameras that broadcast live 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.200
 and has great quality ability 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.569
 of image 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.780
 normally the dslr cameras work 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:17.840
 well know of class 10 which is what 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.419
 records full hd better and is what 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.849
 can record faster when you 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:25.430
 take photos in sequence 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.650
 in the fastest sequence and quality 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.150
 Maximum photo too right 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.190
 when you do this sequence of 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.220
 photography has the ability to 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.470
 writing to the card quickly 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.260
 You're taking pictures so you can 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.290
 To make more photos in the sequence here are 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.359
 the most potent cards over 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.769
 powerful today here in the 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:47.419
 Marketplace 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.819
 here in Brazil I do not know if you have all 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:52.250
 These are not the most 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:54.680
 that should be there in the edition 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.290
 they do not know if they have class in this type 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.750
 compact flash drive but it has the 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.310
 minimum capacity than the maximum of 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.590
 né recording 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.040
 and it's always loud here is not the one that is 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:10.160
 600 times as often a thousand times these 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.139
 sandisk a thousand times also since it says 100 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.480
 megabytes per second more or less 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:18.049
 at this maximum speed 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.900
 here are the sd cards that these here 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.300
 are class 10 with these some of them 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.400
 I do not have it here. 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.190
 what 's that card really fast right? 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.639
 and with great capacity also this 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:35.360
 64 gigabytes and these from up there 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:38.360
 also at a maximum of 128 gb, which are the 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.250
 pretty big cards to camera to do 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.020
 formerly not recently, no 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.409
 there was that right 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.629
 have to see if your camera is capable of 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:48.199
 use a card faster than this 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:51.110
 huh 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:54.440
 usually these cameras all have 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:57.289
 a specific card for her is not any 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.300
 specific class to use in the camera 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:02.180
 if you buy a card from yourself 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.550
 big that I too expensive to use in a 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.800
 camera that is not capable of 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.639
 use it can not read on it will not 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.590
 to function 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.419
 so you have to be careful not to 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.120
 spend money on something that will not 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:17.599
 you have to be careful with the 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:22.599
 dslr cameras mainly with the use 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:26.000
 of these micro sd is with the adapter 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:28.819
 usually this micro sd with adapter 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.690
 it does not work to write it full 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:32.120
 hd 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.770
 It is for making photography more 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:38.870
 When you're going to film it, you already give a message. 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:41.690
 error because this connection is the dodo 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:44.419
 this adapter with the card is not as 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:47.120
 fast as full HD needs even 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:49.789
 for what it is aggravating while 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.469
 vaa filming so that's it folks it's 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:53.270
 saulo was well curtinha it was only 

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:55.669
 people have a little knowledge 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.669
 the larger on these cards in ink will 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:01.039
 talk more about it touching photos 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:03.199
 in the digital age Neitiznot for us to see what 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:05.210
 is the best type of storage 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:06.860
 so this is it, guys, thank you 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.659
 For attending this class click no 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.240
 I liked if you liked share 

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:14.229
 Thank you very much and 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.229
 Until the next class
