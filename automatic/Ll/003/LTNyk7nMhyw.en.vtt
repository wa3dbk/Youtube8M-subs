00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:24.070
 if you don't break if you perform 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.849
 all as you are told that you take off the weight 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.720
 body you can not doubt it 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:36.790
 if you don't break if you perform 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:39.510
 then output or where not to go anywhere with them, I 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:43.750
 I work very few women with 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:51.220
 men with children i know what i do and 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:52.540
 I know that when I grow green 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:58.960
 plant 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:01:00.510
 here these plants their mass increases 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.520
 due to photosynthesis 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:08.229
 they take carbon dioxide from the air and 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:11.740
 synthesizes its body by solar 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:14.460
 and rather than grow stout 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.460
 from guest 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.610
 some amateurs claim that 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:26.320
 people too will start photosynthesizing 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.850
 and to me that university and it can happen 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.590
 but for this, people must first 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.590
 turn green dial chlorophyll and 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.590
 to ring 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.060
 I am not taking root everybody else 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.060
 will turn out 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.950
 and there are some diseases when people 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:59.890
 don't really eat anything 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:02.710
 and fatten it is people very sick it 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:09.070
 the last stages of diabetes 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:12.910
 these are very serious disruptions 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:16.060
 heart and ruined furnace 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:20.370
 then the strongest watering occurs 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.370
 the organism calls it dropsy 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:35.540
 we are gaining body weight from 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:41.330
 excess power and now to take off 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:44.540
 this body weight we should get such 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.270
 impact that stimulates our 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:51.710
 metabolism 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:54.920
 first second we have to lower 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:57.500
 the amount of food consumed but not 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.970
 less should we eat energy 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.890
 food is food which includes your 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:08.840
 Metabolism of work is food which 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:11.720
 turns off when you eat that food 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.020
 which I give you it includes sharing 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.510
 substances and every time you eat it 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:20.210
 then your fat begins to burn if you 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.090
 missed food and didn't eat that fat not 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:30.440
 burns and how canned mothballed 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:32.780
 and all the same food as flour and fat 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.739
 include virtually a metabolism and 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.630
 people become sleepy apathetic and 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:41.020
 metabolism is very reduced and fat is not 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.790
 burns in the body of these people 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.280
 if you add a little fat 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.320
 your fat your food you do not get 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.900
 Here is the energy impact of food 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:57.350
 anyway the time of this weight loss 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:58.450
 there are people who can raise your 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.970
 metabolism 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:05.000
 I have this ability but 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.180
 my ability is not enough important in 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.489
 your receivers if you have them you 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:16.300
 accept this energy if you don't have it 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.300
 it's nothing you can do 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:22.620
 But what does this receiver mean or not? 

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:26.860
 this receiver 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:29.980
 that means how I treat you 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:34.600
 love and respect you owe me 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:38.680
 treat just like i do everything 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.530
 for my part to take off my body weight 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.350
 don't walk yourself 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:46.870
 you should think about me too 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:52.330
 do everything for me to be 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:55.720
 easier to work if you hang the legs 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:05:00.820
 and handles completely on me i'm alone nothing 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:04.380
 I can not do absolutely who wants 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:07.450
 hang the arms and legs on your viewer 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.540
 should take out where they are from mother 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:13.230
 from and beat there he is forced to obey 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:17.940
 we have this person in town 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:21.510
 never from there people come to me 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:24.880
 oh god what are they good tee man with 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:28.510
 what they love me they serve 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:31.900
 her every word I say all that they 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:35.170
 perform by a thousand one percent because 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:40.090
 what they got is finally human 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:41.680
 to your relationship among you too there are those 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.440
 who were in that place to me 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.010
 talked 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:50.090
 you know what i'm talking about i'm always talking 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:53.660
 ask oh my goodness how good is the fruit 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.820
 man exists like me after him 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:59.830
 easy 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.830
 how well do they lose weight after him 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:05.150
 but not everyone is on the near 17 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.070
 the absolute majority of women who 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:10.040
 comes to me beautifully filmed 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:12.380
 perfectly take off body weight and take off 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.420
 very much and of course I would again 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.000
 I repeat when there's so much removed 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:19.040
 as you do not have and body weight of course you need 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.960
 give rest need give yourself rest 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.540
 but no matter what you are here 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:27.410
 you are already means a lot 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:29.870
 it means you already get a lot for yourself 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:32.300
 like energy sources inward and 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.340
 you are your luggage and it is always in life 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.560
 can be used further on these 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:40.280
 soviet time when i had to 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:43.850
 am go to the institute for the evening go to 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:46.100
 group to women i have weight i'm not 

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.710
 asked in general how to me 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:51.350
 I am sitting at weight 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:54.800
 and as I wanted I did not have time she is what 

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:58.669
 I am the United States to the fact that I had to give people 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:00.830
 very much I and I danced with them and 

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:01.550
 white gymnastics did and impact 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.980
 gave away 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.910
 and everything absolutely I had no problems 

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.130
 tie the case 

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:10.220
 than you can more than you more 

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:12.380
 you know what you will do more 

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:15.530
 the less you will have weight problems 

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.980
 body that's why i have you so much to 

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.310
 you 

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:21.680
 that's why I teach you one second 

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:24.919
 the third of which only i extend your 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:29.080
 outlook and give you a lot of who 

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:29.080
 there is something to take here will take
