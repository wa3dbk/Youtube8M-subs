00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:29.180
 Why parliamentarians of the National Assembly makes the corruption circle is so much speculation Thuringia 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:34.070
 The cost goes in. 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.239
 In particular, people pay taxes on the national income and pay the prizes one or two times a year 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.770
 to do or not to do 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:44.810
 This is totally kicked in. This is what Congressman Wendy's bludgeon 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:49.700
 If you come to the embassy consulate in Korea is waiting for your car . 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:54.590
 Now it happens eopgetjiman the past, that people took to the castle when entertaining 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:58.370
 No, the embassy does not have anything to do. 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:03.350
 Let's say that it is entertaining to be changed while eating for the National Assembly. 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.909
 * Provide a luxury dinner and do this with the consulate embassy in Korea 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.180
 I'll be in operation. 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:13.310
 Overseas Koreans are great at present. 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.389
 If you arrive at a foreign airport, 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.170
 You can not leave . 

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:21.409
 The landmines will take care of their friends, or their family will come 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.740
 In this way you do not accept. 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:30.139
 Parliamentarians are in bad shape in the country 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:33.920
 Why do not you go abroad and get a bad backstab 

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:39.469
 I will make 1 2,000 in a year. 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:43.399
 Yet the cost is enormously tear this mean eating so lawmakers can do 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:47.600
 If there is a hundred people, I need a proportional representation. 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:51.469
 Money can be to eat this honey has created proportional representation be trying to extort money 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:57.079
 Then , do we need a real local government like this? 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:58.579
 If the trial is closed, even if it is a little early, 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:04.880
 I have to get rid of it. 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:05.719
 The money is too much, and the local government has too much rain. 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.500
 Because of 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:13.099
 You have to get rid of it all except the provinces. 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:17.720

 WAN while facing a pretext VELAS * 4 What a lesson to the current crisis continues to have 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.819
 It will happen. 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.720
 It costs 200 billion to salvage, but it will keep going up. 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.680
 maybe 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:45.290
 200 billion would go to 3,000 or 3000 won to 400 billion. 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:47.569
 I'm going to look at somebody who's going to be a rugger doll, but a penny 200 billion 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.049
 You can not lift a b at

 Kim Dae Jung has created authority. There is no need for the rights of the People's Rights Commission. 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:04.400
 There's a story in the prosecution court asking what you're doing. 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.640
 I do not have the right to investigate. What the hell are you doing? 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:12.980

 I ask what is the salvation crisis, but the appeal is not being flow 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:21.409

 The Unification Ministry said Kim is going to create something unified Abu Kim Jong Il 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:27.530
 This should not be right now . 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:35.209
