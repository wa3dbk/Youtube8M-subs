00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello everyone with you andrew andreich my 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:09.170
 site all point dot ru 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:19.130
 task 1000 32 for 330 second 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:21.930
 compare under the letter a 715 them and 13 15 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:25.650
 when we compare two fractions we look 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:31.320
 if they have the same denominators here 15 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:35.700
 go 15 then compare only to numerator 13 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.040
 more than 7 therefore 13-15 them more than 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.629
 715 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.899
 if the denominators are the same then 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:47.840
 compare only numerator 13 more 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.840
 than 7 so under the letter b 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:58.260
 8 third and 5 third here the same 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.750
 You can try to pause 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.809
 and think independently what such 3 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.880
 there will be more 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:08.460
 same why because here 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.549
 building and here are the top three denominators 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:16.229
 the same therefore we compare only 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:20.549
 numerator 8 is greater than 5 therefore 8 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:30.290
 third more than 5 third 8 third 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:36.180
 more under the letter v 1 and 4 9 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:39.450
 There is such a rule that the correct fraction 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.740
 always less than one we have this fraction 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.500
 the correct numerator is less than the denominator 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.860
 so this fraction is correct and correct 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.229
 fraction 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.890
 always less noticeable always less 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.470
 units 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:02:01.070
 and the unit is always greater than the correct fraction 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:05.240
 under the letter r and here is the opposite 9 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.240
 fourth and one 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:14.010
 nine more than 4 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:18.050
 if the numerator is greater than the denominator 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:21.239
 then such a fraction is always greater than one 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.959
 if the numerator is less than the denominator then 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:27.780
 such a fraction is always less than one and if 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:32.700
 the numerator is greater than the denominator then such 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:37.220
 the fraction is always greater than one so you 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:46.590
 there are still a few letters the letter d 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:48.170
 letter d 5 third and 0 if we have 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.830
 whose fraction 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.720
 natural number in numerator 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:56.780
 natural number in denominator 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:59.519
 5 3 for example, such a fraction is always greater than 0 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.670
 any fraction doesn't matter 5 stands here or 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:05.459
 three or three-fifths, or March 5 at least as 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:12.840
 here stand normal numbers then this 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:20.400
 the number is always greater than 0 under the letter e is one 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:24.180
 million 1 million or 0 1 million 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:29.640
 or zero of course one millionth is 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.690
 0 little but still has less more 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.760
 one millionth 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.019
 this is a normal ordinary fractions in his 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.750
 the numerator is some number worth and 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:40.440
 denominator the number is such a fraction 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.519
 always greater than 0 no matter 5 thirds or 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.459
 one millionth 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:48.930
 such a fraction is always greater than 0 so these 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:50.970
 fractions are more than zero on it all 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.079
 My name is Andrew Andreevich My site 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.940
 all all I'm lying 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.440
 write in the comments whether it was all 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.540
 clear in solving the problem 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.910
 if you like my video tutorials on 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.660
 advise friends classmate on this 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.660
 all all bye
