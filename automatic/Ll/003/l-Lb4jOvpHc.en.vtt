00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.219 
and why you've had to feed of different
things<00:01:41.220> at<00:01:41.369> different<00:01:41.460> times<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.000> year

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
things at different times of the year

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:48.390 
things at different times of the year
all<00:01:43.229> right<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.860> wash<00:01:44.100> your<00:01:44.220> feet<00:01:44.369> white<00:01:44.610> socks

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.610 

see<00:01:49.330> you<00:01:49.480> don't<00:01:49.630> get<00:01:49.750> this<00:01:49.870> out<00:01:50.050> of<00:01:50.170> freshwater

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
see you don't get this out of freshwater

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.020 
see you don't get this out of freshwater
and<00:01:50.770> saltwater<00:01:50.980> fish<00:01:51.250> is<00:01:51.340> my<00:01:51.460> only<00:01:51.610> go<00:01:51.790> fish

00:01:52.030 --> 00:02:01.530 
and saltwater fish is my only go fish
see<00:01:52.270> that<00:01:52.390> little<00:01:52.540> fat<00:01:52.750> tank<00:01:52.960> you<00:01:53.530> see<00:01:53.770> it<00:02:00.540> okay

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
see that little fat tank you see it okay

they<00:02:08.170> they're<00:02:08.380> all<00:02:08.410> carp<00:02:08.920> and<00:02:09.130> then

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
they they're all carp and then

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.530 
they they're all carp and then
descendants<00:02:09.670> of<00:02:09.729> carp<00:02:10.000> there's<00:02:10.210> different

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
descendants of carp there's different

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.110 
descendants of carp there's different
species<00:02:10.720> and<00:02:11.170> different<00:02:11.860> little<00:02:12.120> descendants

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
species and different little descendants

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.180 
species and different little descendants
in<00:02:13.570> different<00:02:13.900> traits<00:02:14.170> but<00:02:14.800> basically

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
in different traits but basically

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.300 
in different traits but basically
they're<00:02:15.400> all<00:02:15.430> carp<00:02:15.970> so<00:02:16.690> their<00:02:17.590> metabolism

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
they're all carp so their metabolism

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.290 
they're all carp so their metabolism
slows<00:02:18.580> down<00:02:18.850> when<00:02:20.460> the<00:02:21.460> weather<00:02:21.670> changes<00:02:21.760> if

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
slows down when the weather changes if

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.660 
slows down when the weather changes if
it<00:02:22.450> was<00:02:22.600> hot<00:02:22.930> they<00:02:23.530> grow<00:02:23.740> really<00:02:23.920> fast<00:02:24.040> and

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
it was hot they grow really fast and

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.340 
it was hot they grow really fast and
that's<00:02:24.790> why<00:02:24.940> mine<00:02:25.180> had<00:02:25.360> a<00:02:25.390> climax<00:02:25.930> of<00:02:26.080> growth

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
that's why mine had a climax of growth

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.950 
that's why mine had a climax of growth
in<00:02:26.620> July<00:02:26.950> er<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.340> like<00:02:27.640> maybe<00:02:28.300> early<00:02:28.690> early

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
in July er and like maybe early early

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.350 
in July er and like maybe early early
August<00:02:29.410> but<00:02:30.010> now<00:02:30.160> they're<00:02:30.340> slowing<00:02:30.700> down<00:02:30.850> and

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
August but now they're slowing down and

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.350 
August but now they're slowing down and
she<00:02:31.630> got<00:02:31.750> that<00:02:31.840> little<00:02:31.990> quarry<00:02:32.320> right<00:02:32.410> there

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
she got that little quarry right there

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.140 
she got that little quarry right there
but<00:02:34.800> see<00:02:35.800> when<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.100> water<00:02:36.310> turns<00:02:36.550> cold<00:02:36.940> you

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
but see when the water turns cold you

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.760 
but see when the water turns cold you
need<00:02:37.360> you<00:02:37.570> need<00:02:37.750> to<00:02:37.840> twist<00:02:38.170> your<00:02:38.260> food<00:02:38.530> over

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
need you need to twist your food over

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.650 
need you need to twist your food over
because<00:02:39.040> they<00:02:39.190> see<00:02:40.180> you're<00:02:40.330> not<00:02:40.420> really

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
because they see you're not really

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.000 
because they see you're not really
supposed<00:02:40.840> to<00:02:40.960> give<00:02:41.110> goldfish<00:02:41.650> that<00:02:41.830> much

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
supposed to give goldfish that much

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.670 
supposed to give goldfish that much
protein<00:02:42.460> in<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.670> first<00:02:42.880> place<00:02:43.150> so<00:02:43.870> when<00:02:44.590> the

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
protein in the first place so when the

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.870 
protein in the first place so when the
weather<00:02:44.860> cools<00:02:45.070> down<00:02:45.220> you<00:02:45.520> don't<00:02:45.610> want<00:02:45.820> to

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
weather cools down you don't want to

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.500 
weather cools down you don't want to
have<00:02:45.970> much<00:02:46.150> protein<00:02:46.480> at<00:02:46.690> all<00:02:46.780> so<00:02:47.500> on<00:02:48.420> when<00:02:49.420> the

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
have much protein at all so on when the

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:50.670 
have much protein at all so on when the
weather<00:02:49.660> cools<00:02:49.840> down<00:02:49.990> you<00:02:50.290> need<00:02:50.440> to<00:02:50.530> get<00:02:50.650> a

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
weather cools down you need to get a

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.949 
weather cools down you need to get a
type<00:02:51.490> of<00:02:51.610> food<00:02:51.820> that<00:02:51.850> has<00:02:52.090> wheat<00:02:52.360> germ<00:02:52.690> in<00:02:52.870> it

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
type of food that has wheat germ in it

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.170 
type of food that has wheat germ in it
and<00:02:53.140> wheat<00:02:53.650> germ<00:02:53.680> it<00:02:54.100> allows<00:02:54.400> them<00:02:54.730> basically

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
and wheat germ it allows them basically

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.270 
and wheat germ it allows them basically
to<00:02:55.450> eat<00:02:55.630> in<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:55.989> fall<00:02:56.230> in<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.620> winter<00:02:56.830> time

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
to eat in the fall in the winter time

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.190 
to eat in the fall in the winter time
when<00:02:57.459> it's<00:02:57.610> really<00:02:57.760> cool<00:02:58.090> because<00:02:58.720> that's<00:02:59.050> how

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
when it's really cool because that's how

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.600 
when it's really cool because that's how
I<00:02:59.230> live<00:02:59.440> is<00:02:59.560> a<00:02:59.620> loose<00:02:59.800> fish<00:03:00.100> in<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.370> winter

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
I live is a loose fish in the winter

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.370 
I live is a loose fish in the winter
it's<00:03:01.090> because<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.690> fish<00:03:01.870> aren't<00:03:02.110> they<00:03:02.320> don't

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
it's because the fish aren't they don't

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.510 
it's because the fish aren't they don't
have<00:03:02.530> enough<00:03:02.680> fat<00:03:02.890> on<00:03:03.070> it<00:03:03.100> it's<00:03:03.400> basically

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
have enough fat on it it's basically

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.580 
have enough fat on it it's basically
they<00:03:03.820> go<00:03:03.970> through<00:03:04.209> like<00:03:04.720> bears<00:03:05.050> there's<00:03:05.350> kind

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
they go through like bears there's kind

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.050 
they go through like bears there's kind
of<00:03:05.650> hibernation<00:03:05.830> but<00:03:06.340> they<00:03:06.430> stay<00:03:06.640> awake<00:03:06.880> they

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
of hibernation but they stay awake they

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.490 
of hibernation but they stay awake they
just<00:03:07.239> don't<00:03:07.450> really<00:03:07.630> do<00:03:07.900> much<00:03:08.080> they<00:03:08.350> just

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
just don't really do much they just

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.680 
just don't really do much they just
basically<00:03:09.010> breathe<00:03:09.640> in<00:03:09.850> there<00:03:10.000> their<00:03:10.450> heart

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
basically breathe in there their heart

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.210 
basically breathe in there their heart
rate<00:03:10.900> everything<00:03:11.470> slows<00:03:11.950> down

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
rate everything slows down

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.600 
rate everything slows down
pretty<00:03:12.940> slow<00:03:13.450> and<00:03:14.010> you<00:03:15.010> just<00:03:15.160> want<00:03:15.400> to<00:03:15.459> had

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
pretty slow and you just want to had

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.280 
pretty slow and you just want to had
that<00:03:15.640> fat<00:03:16.120> on<00:03:16.330> them<00:03:16.510> because<00:03:16.660> it's<00:03:16.930> time<00:03:17.080> to<00:03:17.200> be

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
that fat on them because it's time to be

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.479 
that fat on them because it's time to be
too<00:03:17.380> mine<00:03:17.560> up<00:03:17.739> because<00:03:17.890> I<00:03:17.920> want<00:03:18.070> them<00:03:18.160> fatten

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
too mine up because I want them fatten

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:19.560 
too mine up because I want them fatten
I'm<00:03:18.550> kind<00:03:18.790> of<00:03:18.850> worried<00:03:19.000> about<00:03:19.120> little<00:03:19.420> guys

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
I'm kind of worried about little guys

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.240 
I'm kind of worried about little guys
that<00:03:19.600> were<00:03:19.959> born<00:03:20.230> this<00:03:20.380> year<00:03:20.620> because<00:03:21.070> they're

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
that were born this year because they're

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.310 
that were born this year because they're
not<00:03:21.340> really<00:03:21.580> fat<00:03:22.150> fat<00:03:22.510> like<00:03:22.720> that<00:03:22.870> koi<00:03:23.110> right

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
not really fat fat like that koi right

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.620 
not really fat fat like that koi right
there<00:03:23.500> and<00:03:23.860> I'm<00:03:24.670> just<00:03:24.730> gonna<00:03:24.940> feed<00:03:25.180> them<00:03:25.270> up<00:03:25.450> as

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
there and I'm just gonna feed them up as
