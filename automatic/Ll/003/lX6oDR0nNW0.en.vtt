00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.280 
David Mexico and likes to say I think we
finished<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:39.210> one<00:01:39.450> about<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.869> year<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.229> a

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
finished this one about a year and a

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.350 
finished this one about a year and a
half<00:01:40.439> ago<00:01:40.590> which<00:01:41.040> in<00:01:41.310> animation<00:01:41.700> isn't

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
half ago which in animation isn't

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.210 
half ago which in animation isn't
actually<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.869> huge<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.500> lag<00:01:43.649> time<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.100> maybe

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
actually that huge a lag time so maybe

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.590 
actually that huge a lag time so maybe
it<00:01:44.369> was<00:01:44.460> longer<00:01:44.700> maybe<00:01:44.939> it's<00:01:45.090> two<00:01:45.270> years<00:01:45.479> but

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
it was longer maybe it's two years but

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.090 
it was longer maybe it's two years but
it's<00:01:45.840> funny<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.140> speed<00:01:46.290> was<00:01:46.409> like<00:01:46.500> now<00:01:46.890> it's

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
it's funny the speed was like now it's

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.770 
it's funny the speed was like now it's
finally<00:01:47.310> endings<00:01:47.759> like<00:01:47.820> it's<00:01:48.149> actually<00:01:48.600> I've

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
finally endings like it's actually I've

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.330 
finally endings like it's actually I've
been<00:01:48.960> done<00:01:49.110> for<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.350> while<00:01:49.380> was<00:01:49.920> there<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.100> big

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
been done for a while was there a big

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.550 
been done for a while was there a big
difference<00:01:50.399> going<00:01:50.850> from<00:01:51.180> Fox<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.229> Comedy

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
difference going from Fox to Comedy

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.469 
difference going from Fox to Comedy

change and the show or was it pretty
consistent<00:01:57.570> actually<00:01:58.020> we<00:01:58.350> were<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:59.100> amazingly

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
consistent actually we were so amazingly

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.850 
consistent actually we were so amazingly
fortunate<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.570> get<00:02:00.750> most<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.320> our<00:02:01.439> writers

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
fortunate to get most of our writers

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.230 
fortunate to get most of our writers
back<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.130> mean<00:02:02.430> we<00:02:02.490> had<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.610> couple<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:02.909> guys<00:02:03.000> who

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
back I mean we had a couple of guys who

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.850 
back I mean we had a couple of guys who
you<00:02:03.509> know<00:02:03.630> Eric<00:02:03.990> Kaplan<00:02:04.380> was<00:02:04.500> one<00:02:04.649> of<00:02:04.740> our

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
you know Eric Kaplan was one of our

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.109 
you know Eric Kaplan was one of our
original<00:02:04.890> writers<00:02:05.340> went<00:02:05.490> on<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.759> Big<00:02:05.909> Bang

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
original writers went on to Big Bang

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.690 
original writers went on to Big Bang
Theory<00:02:06.570> but<00:02:06.840> by<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.259> large<00:02:07.320> we<00:02:07.770> had<00:02:08.099> all<00:02:08.520> the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
Theory but by and large we had all the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.460 
Theory but by and large we had all the
same<00:02:08.849> producers<00:02:09.300> all<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.720> same<00:02:09.899> writers<00:02:10.259> all

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
same producers all the same writers all

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.280 
same producers all the same writers all
the<00:02:10.649> same<00:02:10.830> cast<00:02:11.129> so<00:02:11.520> really<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.180> felt<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.930> same

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
the same cast so really it felt the same

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.050 
the same cast so really it felt the same
and<00:02:13.530> I<00:02:13.769> felt<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:14.159> the<00:02:14.549> scripts<00:02:14.909> themselves

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
and I felt that the scripts themselves

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.910 
and I felt that the scripts themselves
in<00:02:15.689> as<00:02:15.900> much<00:02:15.989> as<00:02:16.049> they<00:02:16.230> change<00:02:16.500> they<00:02:16.650> just<00:02:16.830> got

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
in as much as they change they just got

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.979 
in as much as they change they just got
better<00:02:17.250> we<00:02:17.579> got<00:02:17.730> deeper<00:02:18.000> into<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.450> world<00:02:18.599> we

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
better we got deeper into the world we

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.539 
better we got deeper into the world we
discovered<00:02:19.470> more<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:19.709> more<00:02:20.010> things<00:02:20.250> about

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
discovered more and more things about

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.580 
discovered more and more things about
the<00:02:20.730> characters<00:02:21.209> it<00:02:21.450> didn't<00:02:21.810> feel<00:02:22.019> different

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
the characters it didn't feel different

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.199 
the characters it didn't feel different
it<00:02:22.680> just<00:02:22.860> felt<00:02:23.069> more<00:02:23.489> do<00:02:23.730> you<00:02:23.760> know<00:02:23.939> if<00:02:24.120> they

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
it just felt more do you know if they

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.210 
it just felt more do you know if they
have<00:02:24.329> any<00:02:24.480> plans<00:02:24.599> for<00:02:24.900> any<00:02:25.140> future<00:02:25.349> Futurama

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
writers really try to give it a little

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.119 
writers really try to give it a little
bit<00:02:57.629> of<00:02:57.720> closure<00:02:57.930> so<00:02:58.379> this<00:02:58.530> definitely<00:02:58.829> has

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
bit of closure so this definitely has

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:00.500 
bit of closure so this definitely has
that<00:02:59.159> what<00:02:59.639> would<00:02:59.760> you<00:02:59.909> like<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.299> say<00:03:00.480> to
