00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
their speedo on the outside and that's

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.499 
their speedo on the outside and that's
where<00:01:25.810> they<00:01:26.050> got<00:01:26.290> the<00:01:26.409> idea<00:01:26.460> for<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:28.030> original

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
where they got the idea for the original

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.240 
where they got the idea for the original
suit<00:01:28.810> it<00:01:29.020> was<00:01:29.110> based<00:01:29.350> on<00:01:29.470> a<00:01:29.530> muscle<00:01:29.890> man<00:01:29.979> suit

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
suit it was based on a muscle man suit

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.219 
suit it was based on a muscle man suit
and<00:01:30.430> so<00:01:30.550> that's<00:01:30.729> kind<00:01:30.970> of<00:01:31.030> a<00:01:31.180> very<00:01:34.080> dated<00:01:35.080> thing

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
and so that's kind of a very dated thing

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.590 
and so that's kind of a very dated thing
now<00:01:35.470> and<00:01:35.649> so<00:01:35.860> if<00:01:36.130> we<00:01:36.340> introduce<00:01:36.880> kids<00:01:37.270> to<00:01:37.390> that

now and so if we introduce kids to that

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.749 
now and so if we introduce kids to that
who<00:01:37.899> don't<00:01:38.200> know<00:01:38.380> who<00:01:38.979> and<00:01:39.100> what<00:01:39.220> Superman<00:01:39.550> is
