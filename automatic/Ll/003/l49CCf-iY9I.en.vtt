00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.620 
what it is right now it kind of
stretches<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.759> entire<00:02:05.850> picture<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.450> fill

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
stretches the entire picture to fill

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.850 
stretches the entire picture to fill
your<00:02:06.719> monitor<00:02:07.220> we

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
your monitor we

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.440 
your monitor we
I<00:02:08.920> don't<00:02:09.190> really<00:02:09.700> want<00:02:09.940> that<00:02:10.000> because<00:02:10.270> it's

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
I don't really want that because it's

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.750 
I don't really want that because it's
pixellating<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.200> picture<00:02:11.530> rather<00:02:12.340> than<00:02:12.550> that

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
pixellating the picture rather than that

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.430 
pixellating the picture rather than that
if<00:02:13.600> we<00:02:13.810> try<00:02:14.020> fit<00:02:14.760> then<00:02:15.760> you'll<00:02:16.420> see<00:02:16.660> that<00:02:16.870> the

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
if we try fit then you'll see that the

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.160 
if we try fit then you'll see that the
picture<00:02:17.880> picture<00:02:18.880> minimizes<00:02:19.630> to<00:02:19.780> fit<00:02:19.960> within

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
picture picture minimizes to fit within

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.910 
picture picture minimizes to fit within
my<00:02:20.620> screen<00:02:21.250> resolution<00:02:22.050> so<00:02:23.050> I<00:02:23.080> guess<00:02:23.410> this<00:02:23.710> is

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
my screen resolution so I guess this is

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.770 
my screen resolution so I guess this is
this<00:02:24.100> is<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.310> way<00:02:24.430> I<00:02:24.460> want<00:02:24.790> it<00:02:24.910> and<00:02:27.600> I'm<00:02:28.600> going

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
this is the way I want it and I'm going

this is the same pretty much pretty much
the<00:03:55.840> same<00:03:56.049> steps<00:03:56.350> for<00:03:56.640> Windows<00:03:57.640> 7<00:03:57.760> as<00:03:57.940> well<00:03:58.120> and
