00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.459 

everybody's<00:00:09.450> launched<00:00:09.809> siphon<00:00:10.290> and<00:00:10.349> we're

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
everybody's launched siphon and we're

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.290 
everybody's launched siphon and we're
taking<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.769> look<00:00:10.889> at<00:00:11.040> yet<00:00:11.219> another<00:00:11.300> Chromebook

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
taking a look at yet another Chromebook

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.459 
taking a look at yet another Chromebook
and<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.540> reason<00:00:12.840> is<00:00:12.960> is<00:00:13.110> that<00:00:13.139> we've<00:00:13.320> looked

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
and the reason is is that we've looked

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.730 
and the reason is is that we've looked
at<00:00:13.679> HP<00:00:14.610> Asus<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.480> Samsung<00:00:15.990> but<00:00:16.170> we<00:00:16.289> haven't

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
at HP Asus and Samsung but we haven't

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.710 
at HP Asus and Samsung but we haven't
looked<00:00:16.859> at<00:00:17.070> Acer<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.090> lot<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.330> people<00:00:18.539> said

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
looked at Acer and a lot of people said

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.810 
looked at Acer and a lot of people said
you've<00:00:18.869> got<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.199> check<00:00:19.350> out<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.710> Acer<00:00:20.070> c720

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
you've got to check out the Acer c720

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.599 
you've got to check out the Acer c720
and<00:00:21.240> when<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:22.020> go<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.199> look<00:00:22.410> at<00:00:22.500> an<00:00:22.650> Acer<00:00:22.949> c720

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
and when you go to look at an Acer c720

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.340 
and when you go to look at an Acer c720
there's<00:00:23.939> actually<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.330> bunch<00:00:24.630> of<00:00:24.840> them<00:00:24.990> because

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
there's actually a bunch of them because

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.279 
there's actually a bunch of them because
they<00:00:25.529> give<00:00:26.010> them<00:00:26.160> all<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.640> same<00:00:26.849> c720<00:00:27.689> moniker

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
they give them all the same c720 moniker

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.050 
they give them all the same c720 moniker
so<00:00:28.439> you've<00:00:28.560> got<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.769> look<00:00:28.920> at<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.849> little

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
so you've got to look at the little

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.020 
so you've got to look at the little
number<00:00:30.420> after<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.850> 2848<00:00:32.850> is

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
number after it so this is the 2848 is

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.490 
number after it so this is the 2848 is
the<00:00:33.180> it's<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.540> least<00:00:33.719> expensive<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.469> I

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
the it's the least expensive that I

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.720 
the it's the least expensive that I
could<00:00:34.710> find<00:00:34.920> on<00:00:35.070> Amazon

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
could find on Amazon

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.510 
could find on Amazon
this<00:00:36.300> one<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.829> $1.99<00:00:37.829> at<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.100> time<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.399> I'm

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
this one is $1.99 at the time that I'm

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.819 
this one is $1.99 at the time that I'm
shooting<00:00:38.790> this<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.450> like<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.170> lot<00:00:40.620> and

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
shooting this and I like this a lot and

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.369 
shooting this and I like this a lot and
the<00:00:40.950> reason<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.030> one<00:00:42.300> has<00:00:42.600> much

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
the reason is is that this one has much

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.990 
the reason is is that this one has much
better<00:00:43.559> performance<00:00:44.219> than<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.370> other<00:00:44.579> 11

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
better performance than the other 11

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.430 
better performance than the other 11
inch<00:00:45.120> Chromebooks<00:00:45.539> I've<00:00:45.690> tried<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.289> just

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
inch Chromebooks I've tried so you just

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.229 
inch Chromebooks I've tried so you just
see<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.680> just<00:00:46.829> feels<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.160> lot<00:00:47.280> easier<00:00:47.789> just<00:00:48.059> by

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
see it just feels a lot easier just by

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.240 
see it just feels a lot easier just by
you<00:00:48.719> know<00:00:48.809> how<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.110> feels<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.649> presents

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
you know how it feels and presents

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.270 
you know how it feels and presents
itself<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.879> when<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.480> ran<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.960> octane<00:00:52.500> 2.0

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
itself and when I ran the octane 2.0

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.889 
itself and when I ran the octane 2.0
test<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.699> we<00:00:53.760> ran<00:00:53.910> on<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.180> other<00:00:54.329> two<00:00:54.570> from

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
test that we ran on the other two from

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.470 
test that we ran on the other two from
Samsung<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:55.980> Asus<00:00:56.370> we're<00:00:57.000> actually<00:00:57.149> running

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
Samsung and Asus we're actually running

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.410 
Samsung and Asus we're actually running
about<00:00:57.750> over<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.050> 35%<00:00:58.770> faster<00:00:59.520> than<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.000> Asus

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
about over a 35% faster than the Asus

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.060 
about over a 35% faster than the Asus
which<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.750> also<00:01:00.960> running<00:01:01.350> an<00:01:01.620> Intel<00:01:01.859> processor

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
which is also running an Intel processor

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.960 
which is also running an Intel processor
this<00:01:02.699> one<00:01:02.969> runs<00:01:03.719> an<00:01:03.870> Intel<00:01:04.170> Celeron<00:01:04.439> -<00:01:04.890> 955<00:01:05.580> you

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
this one runs an Intel Celeron - 955 you

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.820 
this one runs an Intel Celeron - 955 you
which<00:01:06.150> happens<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.659> be<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.960> same<00:01:07.140> processor

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
which happens to be the same processor

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.920 
which happens to be the same processor
that's<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.790> chrome<00:01:09.119> boxes<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.840> we

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
that's in the chrome boxes that we

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.440 
that's in the chrome boxes that we
looked<00:01:10.170> at<00:01:10.350> from<00:01:10.590> HP<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.250> from<00:01:11.820> Asus

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
looked at from HP and from Asus

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.789 
looked at from HP and from Asus
so<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.570> really<00:01:12.900> like<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> performance<00:01:13.650> on

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
so I really like the performance on

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.130 
so I really like the performance on
those<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.400> Chrome<00:01:14.729> OS<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.689> I'm<00:01:15.810> really

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
those in the Chrome OS so I'm really

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.929 
those in the Chrome OS so I'm really
liking<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.590> on<00:01:16.740> here<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.159> really<00:01:17.520> feels<00:01:17.759> like

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
liking it on here it really feels like

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.640 
liking it on here it really feels like
how<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.750> should<00:01:19.020> feel<00:01:19.049> it's<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.439> notebook

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
how it should feel it's a notebook

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.440 
how it should feel it's a notebook
that's<00:01:19.979> fast<00:01:20.400> enough<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.850> respond<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.330> what

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
that's fast enough to respond to what

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.929 
that's fast enough to respond to what
I'm<00:01:21.540> doing<00:01:21.869> on<00:01:21.990> most<00:01:22.200> websites<00:01:22.490> and<00:01:23.490> really<00:01:23.909> I

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
I'm doing on most websites and really I

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.880 
I'm doing on most websites and really I
think<00:01:24.090> probably<00:01:24.540> runs<00:01:24.900> Chrome<00:01:25.200> OS<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.650> best

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
think probably runs Chrome OS the best

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.679 
think probably runs Chrome OS the best
out<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.159> everything<00:01:26.430> I've<00:01:26.700> looked<00:01:26.970> at<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.390> far

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
out of everything I've looked at so far

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.109 
out of everything I've looked at so far
on<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.380> screen<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.920> only<00:01:29.189> so-so<00:01:29.430> it's<00:01:29.939> about

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
on the screen is only so-so it's about

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.910 
on the screen is only so-so it's about
on<00:01:30.329> par<00:01:30.540> with<00:01:30.600> what<00:01:30.900> I've<00:01:30.990> seen<00:01:31.170> on<00:01:31.350> other

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
on par with what I've seen on other

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.190 
on par with what I've seen on other
screens<00:01:32.369> in<00:01:32.610> this<00:01:32.729> 11<00:01:33.119> inch<00:01:33.240> form<00:01:33.509> factor<00:01:33.570> so

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
screens in this 11 inch form factor so

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.350 
screens in this 11 inch form factor so
it's<00:01:34.560> not<00:01:34.740> great<00:01:35.100> but<00:01:35.130> it's<00:01:35.369> certainly<00:01:35.790> usable

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
it's not great but it's certainly usable

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.600 
it's not great but it's certainly usable
the<00:01:36.840> keyboard<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.470> little<00:01:37.799> springy<00:01:38.159> for<00:01:38.460> my

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
the keyboard is a little springy for my

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.429 
the keyboard is a little springy for my
taste<00:01:38.880> but<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.720> keys<00:01:39.869> are<00:01:40.049> nice<00:01:40.200> and

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
taste but the keys are nice and

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.840

full-size<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.159> has<00:01:41.310> pretty<00:01:41.490> much<00:01:41.700> the

full-size and it has pretty much the
same<00:01:42.030> layout<00:01:42.240> we<00:01:43.020> saw<00:01:43.259> on<00:01:43.500> some<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.860> other

same layout we saw on some of the other

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.859 
same layout we saw on some of the other
Chromebooks<00:01:44.880> as<00:01:45.060> well<00:01:45.240> just<00:01:45.450> it's<00:01:45.570> kind<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.810> a

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
Chromebooks as well just it's kind of a

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.870 
Chromebooks as well just it's kind of a
wacky<00:01:46.079> little<00:01:46.380> arrow<00:01:46.920> key<00:01:47.159> configuration

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
wacky little arrow key configuration

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.789 
wacky little arrow key configuration

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
here at the bottom beyond that you've

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.819

out power and a headphone jack and on
the<00:01:55.200> other<00:01:55.320> side<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:56.280> have<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.520> SD<00:01:57.030> card<00:01:57.479> slot

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
the other side you have a SD card slot

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.139 
the other side you have a SD card slot
here<00:01:58.710> for<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.920> full<00:01:59.130> sized<00:01:59.310> SD<00:01:59.700> card<00:02:00.000> and

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
here for a full sized SD card and

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
another USB 2.0 slot on there as well

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.459 
another USB 2.0 slot on there as well
this<00:02:03.090> will<00:02:03.210> actually<00:02:03.299> support<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.810> headset<00:02:04.200> too

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
this will actually support a headset too

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.039 
this will actually support a headset too
so<00:02:04.680> if<00:02:04.740> you've<00:02:04.860> got<00:02:05.070> like<00:02:05.610> an<00:02:05.670> iPhone<00:02:06.149> headset

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
so if you've got like an iPhone headset

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.499 
so if you've got like an iPhone headset
it<00:02:07.229> will<00:02:07.380> work<00:02:08.039> just<00:02:08.280> fine<00:02:08.459> on<00:02:08.520> here<00:02:08.879> so<00:02:09.060> weight

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
it will work just fine on here so weight

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.420 
it will work just fine on here so weight
wise<00:02:09.720> it's<00:02:09.989> about<00:02:10.170> 2<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.560> 1/2<00:02:10.649> pounds<00:02:11.280> so

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
wise it's about 2 and 1/2 pounds so

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.070 
wise it's about 2 and 1/2 pounds so
about<00:02:11.700> what<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.150> other<00:02:12.300> ones<00:02:12.540> weigh<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:12.870> feels

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
about what the other ones weigh it feels

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.030 
about what the other ones weigh it feels
for<00:02:13.290> some<00:02:13.440> reason<00:02:13.680> a<00:02:13.739> little

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
for some reason a little

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.860 
for some reason a little
heavier<00:02:14.400> but<00:02:14.670> that's<00:02:15.060> just<00:02:15.209> me<00:02:15.420> I<00:02:15.450> don't

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
heavier but that's just me I don't

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.000 
heavier but that's just me I don't
really<00:02:15.989> I<00:02:16.049> don't<00:02:16.200> have<00:02:16.409> all<00:02:16.530> three<00:02:16.739> here<00:02:16.950> to

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
really I don't have all three here to

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.009 
really I don't have all three here to
really<00:02:17.189> test<00:02:17.459> to<00:02:17.640> know<00:02:17.819> exactly<00:02:18.569> which<00:02:18.720> one<00:02:18.930> is

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
really test to know exactly which one is

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.539 
really test to know exactly which one is
the<00:02:19.140> lightest<00:02:19.530> but<00:02:19.709> it<00:02:20.040> feels<00:02:20.189> just<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.519> little

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
the lightest but it feels just a little

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:21.740 
the lightest but it feels just a little
bit<00:02:20.790> heavier<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.269> it<00:02:21.329> might<00:02:21.450> just<00:02:21.599> be<00:02:21.720> that

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
bit heavier and it might just be that

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.300 
bit heavier and it might just be that
they've<00:02:22.049> the<00:02:22.409> weight<00:02:22.590> is<00:02:22.739> kind<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:22.980> centered

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
they've the weight is kind of centered

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.979 
they've the weight is kind of centered
in<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.519> back<00:02:23.700> of<00:02:23.909> the<00:02:24.000> unit<00:02:24.269> it<00:02:24.510> heats<00:02:24.720> up<00:02:24.900> a

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
in the back of the unit it heats up a

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.270 
in the back of the unit it heats up a
little<00:02:25.170> bit<00:02:25.319> more<00:02:25.500> than<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.739> other<00:02:25.890> ones<00:02:26.099> do

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
little bit more than the other ones do

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.729 
little bit more than the other ones do
because<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:27.000> is<00:02:27.120> running<00:02:27.569> a<00:02:27.629> faster<00:02:28.049> processor

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
because it is running a faster processor

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.949 
because it is running a faster processor
that<00:02:28.890> consumes<00:02:29.310> more<00:02:29.519> power<00:02:29.579> but<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.629> battery

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
that consumes more power but the battery

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.800 
that consumes more power but the battery
life<00:02:31.170> from<00:02:31.680> Acer<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.299> rated<00:02:33.299> at<00:02:33.420> about<00:02:33.450> eight

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
life from Acer is rated at about eight

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.660 
life from Acer is rated at about eight
and<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:33.959> half<00:02:33.989> hours<00:02:34.680> so<00:02:34.920> it's<00:02:35.069> it's<00:02:35.430> less

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
and a half hours so it's it's less

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.160 
and a half hours so it's it's less
battery<00:02:35.970> life<00:02:36.299> and<00:02:36.510> you'll<00:02:36.599> see<00:02:36.810> out<00:02:36.989> of<00:02:37.019> the

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
battery life and you'll see out of the

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.660 
battery life and you'll see out of the
other<00:02:37.200> Chromebooks<00:02:37.829> out<00:02:37.980> there<00:02:38.190> but<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.489> also

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
other Chromebooks out there but you also

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.970 
other Chromebooks out there but you also
get<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.629> greater<00:02:39.810> performance<00:02:40.409> so<00:02:40.590> you<00:02:40.890> know

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
get the greater performance so you know

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.559 
get the greater performance so you know
if<00:02:41.040> you're<00:02:41.129> really<00:02:41.280> looking<00:02:41.519> for<00:02:41.700> as<00:02:42.120> long<00:02:42.359> as

if you're really looking for as long as
you<00:02:42.659> can<00:02:42.870> go<00:02:43.049> battery<00:02:43.470> life<00:02:43.680> this<00:02:43.920> is<00:02:44.069> probably

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
you can go battery life this is probably

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.619 
you can go battery life this is probably
not<00:02:44.579> the<00:02:44.640> one<00:02:44.909> for<00:02:45.120> you<00:02:45.269> but<00:02:45.450> if<00:02:45.540> you're

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
not the one for you but if you're

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.360 
not the one for you but if you're
looking<00:02:45.689> for<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:46.650> know<00:02:46.739> something<00:02:47.069> that<00:02:47.099> at

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
looking for you know something that at

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.640 
looking for you know something that at
least<00:02:47.400> will<00:02:47.700> give<00:02:47.879> you<00:02:48.060> some<00:02:48.569> desktop<00:02:49.260> like

there<00:02:52.440> it<00:02:52.590> feels<00:02:52.739> really<00:02:53.250> nice<00:02:53.879> nicely

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
there it feels really nice nicely

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.240 
there it feels really nice nicely
performing<00:02:54.959> and<00:02:55.079> I<00:02:55.109> think<00:02:55.349> it's<00:02:55.500> a<00:02:55.680> very<00:02:56.010> nice

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
performing and I think it's a very nice

those are a little bit higher performing
