00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
that's done the whole already but anyway

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.690 
that's done the whole already but anyway
he<00:00:32.969> comes<00:00:33.239> as<00:00:33.510> elf<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.200> win<00:00:35.100> goo<00:00:35.340> oh<00:00:37.460> okay<00:00:38.460> I

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
he comes as elf and win goo oh okay I

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.790 
he comes as elf and win goo oh okay I
batted<00:00:39.210> him<00:00:39.300> before<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:39.960> made<00:00:40.440> him<00:00:40.590> faint

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
batted him before and I made him faint

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.110

but<00:00:41.010> he<00:00:41.129> went<00:00:41.280> there<00:00:41.399> last<00:00:41.579> time<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:41.969> could

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
but he went there last time so I could

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.400 
but he went there last time so I could
get<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.329> full<00:00:42.510> heal<00:00:42.719> but<00:00:42.840> he's<00:00:42.989> trapped<00:00:43.290> me

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
get that full heal but he's trapped me

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.170 
get that full heal but he's trapped me
from<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.649> fool<00:00:43.800> heal<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.760> we're<00:00:44.910> gonna<00:00:45.030> have

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
from the fool heal so we're gonna have

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.090 
from the fool heal so we're gonna have
to<00:00:45.239> battle<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.840> for<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.079> fool<00:00:46.320> Hugh<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.649> guess

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
to battle you for the fool Hugh I guess

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.700 
to battle you for the fool Hugh I guess
anyway<00:00:47.899> hopefully<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:49.050> time<00:00:49.260> we<00:00:49.410> won't<00:00:49.530> make

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
anyway hopefully this time we won't make

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.860 
anyway hopefully this time we won't make
you<00:00:49.980> faint<00:00:50.340> but<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.210> think<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.600> one<00:00:51.750> might

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
you faint but I think this one might

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.729 
you faint but I think this one might
have<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.110> less<00:00:52.559> special<00:00:53.160> defense<00:00:53.730> as<00:00:54.739> mesprit

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
have a less special defense as mesprit

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.540 
have a less special defense as mesprit
because<00:00:56.129> i<00:00:56.160> used<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:58.340> thunderbolt<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.460> they

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
because i used a thunderbolt and they

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.630 
because i used a thunderbolt and they
actually<00:00:59.879> did<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.420> much<00:01:00.629> damage<00:01:01.460> are<00:01:02.460> you

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
actually did so much damage are you

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.219 
actually did so much damage are you
psychic<00:01:02.969> which<00:01:03.329> isn't<00:01:03.660> very<00:01:03.690> effective<00:01:04.170> and

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
psychic which isn't very effective and

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.370 
psychic which isn't very effective and
that<00:01:04.350> did<00:01:04.470> loads<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.830> damage<00:01:05.129> as<00:01:05.250> well<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.820> I

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
that did loads the damage as well so I

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.170

probably gonna go try and find a Reggie
I<00:03:52.430> guess<00:03:52.700> I<00:03:52.939> mean<00:03:53.150> we<00:03:53.390> need<00:03:53.510> to<00:03:53.689> go<00:03:54.349> into

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
I guess I mean we need to go into

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.080 
I guess I mean we need to go into
therapy<00:03:54.680> and<00:03:55.129> find<00:03:55.459> that<00:03:55.640> way<00:03:55.849> you<00:03:55.909> actually

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
therapy and find that way you actually

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.000 
therapy and find that way you actually
have<00:03:56.390> to<00:03:56.480> go<00:03:56.659> to<00:03:56.720> find<00:03:57.140> them<00:03:57.409> but<00:03:57.530> once<00:03:57.769> we've

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
have to go to find them but once we've

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.069
