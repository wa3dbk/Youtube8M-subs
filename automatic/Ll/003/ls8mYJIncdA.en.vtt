00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
and it was you who brought a wrong

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:42.930 
and it was you who brought a wrong

base<00:00:43.239> 10<00:00:43.539> so<00:00:43.750> that<00:00:43.899> you<00:00:44.140> were<00:00:44.320> the<00:00:44.440> one<00:00:44.620> who<00:00:44.649> was

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
base 10 so that you were the one who was

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.350 
base 10 so that you were the one who was

so I guess it's not surprising that

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
people feel that way but it is

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.080 
people feel that way but it is

lose credibility because your claims of
being<00:04:14.099> right<00:04:14.280> simply<00:04:14.640> become<00:04:14.940> unbelievable

no one is right all the time in fact I

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.240 
no one is right all the time in fact I
would<00:04:19.140> argue<00:04:19.169> that<00:04:19.440> it<00:04:19.650> not<00:04:19.769> only<00:04:19.799> increases

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
would argue that it not only increases

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.190 
would argue that it not only increases
your<00:04:20.549> credibility<00:04:20.669> with<00:04:21.299> others<00:04:21.750> but<00:04:22.080> it

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
your credibility with others but it

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.779 
your credibility with others but it

this group that means they're going to
be<00:04:53.220> times<00:04:53.460> when<00:04:53.669> you're<00:04:53.789> wrong<00:04:53.940> but<00:04:54.240> you<00:04:54.360> won't

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539

infallible life is all giggles enjoyed
and<00:05:22.820> over<00:05:23.820> here<00:05:24.060> when<00:05:24.419> you<00:05:24.570> are<00:05:24.780> wrong<00:05:25.140> and<00:05:25.710> you

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
and over here when you are wrong and you

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.680 
and over here when you are wrong and you
admit<00:05:26.250> it<00:05:26.370> to<00:05:26.490> yourself<00:05:26.550> and<00:05:26.940> others<00:05:27.150> good

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.330 
admit it to yourself and others good
things<00:05:27.960> happen<00:05:28.349> you<00:05:28.740> have<00:05:28.860> less<00:05:29.099> nasty

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
things happen you have less nasty

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.300 
things happen you have less nasty
conflicts<00:05:30.260> people<00:05:31.260> respect<00:05:31.650> you<00:05:31.830> more<00:05:32.039> your

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
conflicts people respect you more your

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.159 
conflicts people respect you more your
credibility<00:05:32.880> goes<00:05:33.030> up<00:05:33.300> and<00:05:33.780> you<00:05:33.960> learn<00:05:34.110> things

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:36.169 
credibility goes up and you learn things

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.130 
credibility goes up and you learn things
so<00:05:37.169> now<00:05:37.590> the<00:05:37.650> question<00:05:37.979> is<00:05:38.370> which<00:05:39.210> group<00:05:39.690> would

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
so now the question is which group would

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.260 
so now the question is which group would
you<00:05:40.200> like<00:05:40.530> to<00:05:40.680> be<00:05:40.830> in<00:05:40.979> wouldn't<00:05:41.940> you<00:05:42.000> say<00:05:42.120> that

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
you like to be in wouldn't you say that

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.060 
you like to be in wouldn't you say that
there<00:05:42.419> are<00:05:42.510> probably<00:05:42.900> very<00:05:42.990> few<00:05:43.380> of<00:05:43.800> these

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
there are probably very few of these

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.880 
there are probably very few of these
people<00:05:44.460> in<00:05:44.789> human<00:05:44.970> history<00:05:45.180> actually

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:45.890 
people in human history actually

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.500 
people in human history actually
infallible<00:05:46.890> humans<00:05:47.280> what<00:05:48.060> are<00:05:48.150> the<00:05:48.210> chances

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
infallible humans what are the chances

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.500 
infallible humans what are the chances
that<00:05:48.570> you<00:05:48.780> or<00:05:49.050> I<00:05:49.080> are<00:05:49.530> one<00:05:49.950> of<00:05:50.070> them<00:05:50.330> since<00:05:51.330> it's

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
that you or I are one of them since it's

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.390 
that you or I are one of them since it's
almost<00:05:51.630> certain<00:05:52.260> that<00:05:52.440> you<00:05:52.860> and<00:05:53.010> I<00:05:53.070> are<00:05:53.220> going

almost certain that you and I are going
to<00:05:53.460> be<00:05:53.580> in<00:05:53.640> one<00:05:53.760> of<00:05:53.789> these<00:05:54.030> two<00:05:54.390> groups<00:05:54.800> don't

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
to be in one of these two groups don't

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.589 
to be in one of these two groups don't
you<00:05:56.010> think<00:05:56.220> the<00:05:56.400> better<00:05:56.610> bet<00:05:56.909> is<00:05:57.090> this<00:05:57.390> one

00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:57.599 
you think the better bet is this one

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:00.350 
you think the better bet is this one
than<00:05:58.320> this<00:05:58.440> one<00:05:58.650> so<00:05:58.860> how<00:05:59.849> does<00:05:59.909> this<00:06:00.030> work<00:06:00.210> in

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
than this one so how does this work in

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.570 
than this one so how does this work in
science<00:06:00.570> first<00:06:01.289> as<00:06:01.560> I<00:06:01.650> mentioned<00:06:01.680> scientists

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
science first as I mentioned scientists

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:03.980 
science first as I mentioned scientists
acknowledge<00:06:02.909> that<00:06:03.030> neither<00:06:03.240> they<00:06:03.510> nor<00:06:03.690> their

instruments<00:06:04.590> are<00:06:04.650> perfect<00:06:05.010> and<00:06:05.130> so<00:06:05.580> they

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:05.729 
instruments are perfect and so they

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:07.190 
instruments are perfect and so they
always<00:06:05.940> include<00:06:06.210> an<00:06:06.450> estimate<00:06:06.810> of<00:06:06.930> the<00:06:07.020> error
