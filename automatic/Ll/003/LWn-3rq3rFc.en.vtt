00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
the special I have more against the

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.149 
the special I have more against the
availability<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.170> special<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.799> only<00:01:40.860> way

availability of the special the only way

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.649 
availability of the special the only way
that<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.369> can<00:01:41.579> see<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.909> special<00:01:42.299> is<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.540> have

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
it comes with a DVD I don't even think

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.170 
it comes with a DVD I don't even think

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
it comes with a 3d version or you have

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.219 
it comes with a 3d version or you have
to<00:01:51.299> catch<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.540> when<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.869> airs<00:01:52.020> on<00:01:52.170> Cartoon

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229
