as far as gasket material it's eating
away<00:02:07.259> at<00:02:07.439> that<00:02:07.740> stuff<00:02:08.039> most<00:02:08.549> people<00:02:08.640> don't

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
away at that stuff most people don't

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.530 
away at that stuff most people don't
believe<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:10.170> but<00:02:10.409> when<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.189> look<00:02:11.760> at<00:02:12.480> a

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
believe that but when you look at a

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.059 
believe that but when you look at a
motor<00:02:12.779> that<00:02:12.870> was<00:02:13.109> torn<00:02:13.349> down<00:02:13.529> from<00:02:13.739> that<00:02:13.919> you

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
motor that was torn down from that you

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.280 
motor that was torn down from that you
can<00:02:14.219> definitely<00:02:14.669> see<00:02:14.909> and<00:02:15.719> then<00:02:15.870> now<00:02:16.019> we'll

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
can definitely see and then now we'll

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
can definitely see and then now we'll
demonstrate

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
demonstrate

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.210 
demonstrate
have<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.489> brand-new<00:02:17.819> can<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.300> for<00:02:18.480> power<00:02:18.720> here

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
have a brand-new can of for power here

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.630 
have a brand-new can of for power here
will<00:02:21.319> demonstrate<00:02:22.319> how<00:02:22.890> well<00:02:23.099> for<00:02:23.400> power

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
will demonstrate how well for power

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.570 
will demonstrate how well for power
works<00:02:24.000> in<00:02:24.180> a<00:02:24.239> matter<00:02:24.450> of<00:02:24.569> minutes

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:41.780 

not<00:02:29.580> like<00:02:29.819> months<00:02:30.630> then<00:02:31.080> go<00:02:31.260> by<00:02:40.489> so<00:02:41.489> we'll<00:02:41.640> put

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
not like months then go by so we'll put

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.339 
not like months then go by so we'll put
that<00:02:41.819> in<00:02:42.150> there<00:02:42.300> we'll<00:02:42.510> just<00:02:42.599> let<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:42.989> set

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
that in there we'll just let that set

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.880 
that in there we'll just let that set
for<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.650> couple<00:02:43.739> minutes<00:02:44.069> and<00:02:45.380> all<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.590> strips

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
for a couple minutes and all the strips

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.390 
for a couple minutes and all the strips
are<00:02:47.069> basically<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.670> same<00:02:47.910> we<00:02:48.209> we<00:02:49.110> have<00:02:49.400> metal

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
are basically the same we we have metal

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.120 
are basically the same we we have metal
strips<00:02:50.790> with<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.380> lead-based<00:02:52.380> paint<00:02:52.950> on

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
strips with the lead-based paint on

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.620 
strips with the lead-based paint on
there<00:02:53.310> that's<00:02:53.549> the<00:02:53.700> closest<00:02:54.120> thing<00:02:54.269> we<00:02:54.450> have

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
there that's the closest thing we have

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.430 
there that's the closest thing we have
to<00:02:54.660> resemble<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:57.150> actual<00:02:57.360> carbon<00:02:57.959> buildup<00:02:58.290> in

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
to resemble the actual carbon buildup in

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.400 
to resemble the actual carbon buildup in
a<00:02:58.530> vehicle<00:02:59.090> so

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.030 

huh

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:31.980 

okay

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:39.089 

that<00:03:32.230> he<00:03:32.410> sprayed<00:03:32.830> this

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:58.970 

at<00:03:39.159> drinks<00:03:39.640> they<00:03:40.150> live

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.680 

a<00:03:59.040> couple<00:03:59.760> minutes<00:04:00.030> in<00:04:00.120> one<00:04:00.269> line<00:04:00.480> here

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
a couple minutes in one line here

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.449 
a couple minutes in one line here
probably<00:04:01.319> and<00:04:01.530> you<00:04:01.590> can<00:04:01.800> see<00:04:01.980> it's<00:04:02.129> starting

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
probably and you can see it's starting

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.130 
probably and you can see it's starting
to<00:04:02.489> bubble<00:04:02.760> on<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.060> sides<00:04:03.420> they're<00:04:03.720> starting

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
to bubble on the sides they're starting

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.729 
to bubble on the sides they're starting
to<00:04:04.170> lift<00:04:04.440> it<00:04:04.620> up<00:04:06.110> look<00:04:07.110> you<00:04:07.230> can<00:04:07.379> pick<00:04:07.530> that<00:04:07.560> up

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
to lift it up look you can pick that up

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.130 
to lift it up look you can pick that up
John<00:04:08.220> when<00:04:08.400> your<00:04:08.519> camera<00:04:08.790> a<00:04:09.120> little<00:04:09.900> bit<00:04:10.019> there

John when your camera a little bit there
the<00:04:13.140> thing<00:04:13.349> with<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.769> Conklin<00:04:14.370> for<00:04:14.670> power<00:04:14.940> is

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
the thing with the Conklin for power is

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.280 
the thing with the Conklin for power is
it<00:04:15.510> will<00:04:15.660> remove<00:04:17.359> we<00:04:18.359> have<00:04:18.540> one<00:04:18.780> here<00:04:18.989> we've

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
it will remove we have one here we've

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.250 
it will remove we have one here we've
already<00:04:19.500> I<00:04:19.919> just<00:04:20.729> wanted<00:04:21.030> to<00:04:21.150> show<00:04:21.299> people<00:04:21.630> a

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
already I just wanted to show people a

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.110 
already I just wanted to show people a
new<00:04:22.410> one<00:04:22.590> but<00:04:22.710> this<00:04:22.889> is<00:04:23.070> one<00:04:23.580> that<00:04:23.729> I<00:04:23.760> did

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
new one but this is one that I did

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.330 
new one but this is one that I did
yesterday<00:04:24.360> for<00:04:24.840> a<00:04:24.870> demo<00:04:25.199> and<00:04:25.380> you<00:04:25.440> can<00:04:25.949> see<00:04:26.160> how

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
yesterday for a demo and you can see how

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.770 
yesterday for a demo and you can see how
pulls<00:04:26.790> it<00:04:26.970> off<00:04:27.120> in<00:04:27.389> layers<00:04:27.750> and<00:04:29.600> pull<00:04:30.600> it<00:04:30.690> out

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
pulls it off in layers and pull it out

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.560 
pulls it off in layers and pull it out
of<00:04:30.840> here<00:04:31.139> and<00:04:31.320> the<00:04:32.250> neat<00:04:32.430> thing<00:04:32.669> about<00:04:32.699> when<00:04:33.479> it

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
of here and the neat thing about when it

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.390 
of here and the neat thing about when it
pulls<00:04:33.750> stuff<00:04:34.020> off<00:04:34.260> in<00:04:34.440> layers<00:04:36.949> your<00:04:37.949> carbon

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
pulls stuff off in layers your carbon

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.700 
pulls stuff off in layers your carbon
buildup<00:04:38.760> in<00:04:38.970> your<00:04:39.270> motor<00:04:39.510> that's<00:04:40.110> put<00:04:40.350> on<00:04:40.380> in

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
buildup in your motor that's put on in

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.250 
buildup in your motor that's put on in
layers<00:04:40.949> it<00:04:41.669> doesn't<00:04:42.030> peel<00:04:42.300> it<00:04:42.449> off<00:04:42.539> in<00:04:42.750> chunks

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.740 

which<00:04:46.260> when<00:04:47.039> you<00:04:47.160> have<00:04:47.310> chunks<00:04:48.270> coming<00:04:48.600> off

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
which when you have chunks coming off

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.510 
which when you have chunks coming off
inside<00:04:49.139> there<00:04:49.350> you<00:04:49.470> can<00:04:49.620> plug<00:04:49.860> your<00:04:50.010> injectors

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
inside there you can plug your injectors

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.790 
inside there you can plug your injectors
and<00:04:50.699> that<00:04:50.820> kind<00:04:51.060> of<00:04:51.120> stuff<00:04:51.410> but<00:04:52.410> you<00:04:52.470> can<00:04:52.620> see

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
and that kind of stuff but you can see

00:04:52.800 --> 00:05:00.090 
and that kind of stuff but you can see
it<00:04:52.949> clean<00:04:53.190> that<00:04:53.370> strip<00:04:53.699> is<00:04:53.910> perfect

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.550 

another<00:05:00.730> advantage<00:05:01.150> with<00:05:01.450> the<00:05:01.750> four<00:05:02.290> power

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
another advantage with the four power

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.080 
another advantage with the four power
that<00:05:02.890> you<00:05:02.980> won't<00:05:03.160> see<00:05:03.400> in<00:05:03.520> a<00:05:03.610> whole<00:05:03.760> lot<00:05:03.970> of

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
that you won't see in a whole lot of

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.790 
that you won't see in a whole lot of
other<00:05:04.240> products<00:05:05.140> well<00:05:05.290> you<00:05:05.380> won't<00:05:05.500> see<00:05:05.590> it<00:05:05.740> in

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
other products well you won't see it in

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.880 
other products well you won't see it in
any<00:05:05.980> other<00:05:06.220> products<00:05:06.640> more<00:05:07.300> power<00:05:07.510> will<00:05:07.930> has<00:05:08.860> a

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
any other products more power will has a

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.120 
any other products more power will has a
water<00:05:09.610> dispersant<00:05:10.330> in<00:05:10.420> there<00:05:10.600> actually

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
water dispersant in there actually

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.740 
water dispersant in there actually
breaks<00:05:12.130> the<00:05:12.250> water<00:05:12.520> down<00:05:12.790> into<00:05:13.060> hydrogen<00:05:13.510> and

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
breaks the water down into hydrogen and

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:19.460 
breaks the water down into hydrogen and
oxygen<00:05:14.220> where<00:05:15.220> most<00:05:16.230> most<00:05:17.230> cleaners<00:05:18.220> or<00:05:18.430> water

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
oxygen where most most cleaners or water

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.320 
oxygen where most most cleaners or water
conditioners<00:05:20.470> will<00:05:20.820> basically<00:05:21.820> make<00:05:22.180> the

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
conditioners will basically make the

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.900 
conditioners will basically make the
water<00:05:22.540> a<00:05:22.660> little<00:05:23.050> lighter<00:05:23.320> than<00:05:23.650> the<00:05:23.910> gasoline

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
water a little lighter than the gasoline

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.440 
water a little lighter than the gasoline
and<00:05:25.120> send<00:05:26.020> it<00:05:26.140> out<00:05:26.260> through<00:05:26.320> and<00:05:26.860> it<00:05:27.450> doesn't

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
and send it out through and it doesn't

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.660 
and send it out through and it doesn't
actually<00:05:28.930> burn<00:05:29.170> where<00:05:29.500> we're<00:05:30.130> breaking<00:05:30.520> the

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.670 
actually burn where we're breaking the

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:35.700 
actually burn where we're breaking the
water<00:05:30.910> down<00:05:31.270> and<00:05:32.850> burning<00:05:33.850> it<00:05:34.470> burning<00:05:35.470> the

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
water down and burning it burning the

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:41.460 
water down and burning it burning the
hydrogen<00:05:39.510> there<00:05:40.510> you<00:05:40.660> can<00:05:40.810> definitely<00:05:41.170> see<00:05:41.350> it

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
hydrogen there you can definitely see it

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:47.370 
hydrogen there you can definitely see it
working<00:05:41.860> good<00:05:44.700> peeling<00:05:45.700> it<00:05:45.790> off<00:05:46.170> that's<00:05:47.170> only

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
working good peeling it off that's only

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.950 
working good peeling it off that's only
a<00:05:47.470> couple<00:05:47.800> minutes
