same airline within a very close time
proximity<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.010> each<00:01:05.040> other<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:06.030> just<00:01:06.090> makes<00:01:06.600> me

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
proximity to each other it just makes me

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.289 
proximity to each other it just makes me
think<00:01:06.960> with<00:01:07.860> all<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.220> technology<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.939> we

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
think with all the technology that we

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.140 
think with all the technology that we
have<00:01:09.450> how<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.020> flight<00:01:10.500> 370<00:01:11.220> just<00:01:11.430> disappear

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
have how to flight 370 just disappear

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.820 
have how to flight 370 just disappear
and<00:01:12.360> why<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.570> nobody<00:01:12.840> talking<00:01:13.200> about<00:01:13.680> it

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
and why is nobody talking about it

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.679 
and why is nobody talking about it
anymore<00:01:14.070> did<00:01:14.640> we<00:01:14.760> forget<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.150> an<00:01:15.360> entire

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
anymore did we forget that an entire

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.260 
anymore did we forget that an entire
airplane<00:01:16.140> just<00:01:16.670> disappeared<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.850> now<00:01:18.240> a

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
airplane just disappeared and now a

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.719 
airplane just disappeared and now a
plane's<00:01:18.689> getting<00:01:19.110> shot<00:01:19.380> down<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:20.310> kind<00:01:20.580> of

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
plane's getting shot down this kind of

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.510 
plane's getting shot down this kind of
feels<00:01:21.060> like<00:01:21.390> foul<00:01:21.720> play<00:01:21.750> but<00:01:22.290> in<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.590> end<00:01:22.799> what

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
feels like foul play but in the end what

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.670 
feels like foul play but in the end what
can<00:01:23.850> we<00:01:24.000> really<00:01:24.299> do<00:01:24.570> about<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.350> only

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
can we really do about it the only

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.859 
can we really do about it the only
theory<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.549> have<00:01:26.970> been<00:01:27.210> able<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.630> come<00:01:27.840> up

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
theory that I have been able to come up

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.050 
theory that I have been able to come up
with<00:01:28.130> outside<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.159> it's<00:01:29.490> just<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.880> coincidence

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
with outside of it's just a coincidence

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.660 
with outside of it's just a coincidence
is<00:01:30.689> somebody<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.979> feels<00:01:32.189> like<00:01:32.250> somebody's

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
is somebody it feels like somebody's

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.940 
is somebody it feels like somebody's
experimenting<00:01:33.450> with<00:01:33.479> weapons<00:01:34.079> perhaps<00:01:34.530> but

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
experimenting with weapons perhaps but

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.030 
experimenting with weapons perhaps but
who<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.520> why<00:01:35.659> and<00:01:36.659> why<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.560> commercial

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
who and why and why on commercial

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.789 
who and why and why on commercial
airlines<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.880> why<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.180> same<00:01:39.570> airline<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:40.350> it

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
airlines and why the same airline is it

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.499 
airlines and why the same airline is it
terrorists<00:01:41.490> or<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.090> just<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.360> coincidence

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
terrorists or is it just a coincidence

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.870 
terrorists or is it just a coincidence
