00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.690
 new partners from the factory and today 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.360
 it's about the topic of micronutrients 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:12.210
 vs micronutrients so that's always 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.360
 such a topic first very briefly 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.390
 what the macro nutrients so the 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:22.529
 Micronutrients are carbohydrates fat 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.199
 and protein so the three building blocks the 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.199
 eat in the food and are micronutrients 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.420
 vitamins trace elements minerals and 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.640
 enzymes there you have to do all this 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.590
 so imagine 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.510
 So there is this the teaching 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.940
 German food can be good 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.530
 example noodles in normal hard white 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.020
 green will not be here like us anymore 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.450
 find or generally processed 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.090
 You will not get so many products 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.340
 vitamins minerals trace elements and 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.379
 find enzymes like now for example in 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.949
 and processed fruits or vegetables yes 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.460
 now it's just so you can do that 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.949
 pretend you are in yours 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.909
 body yes i do not know a truckload 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.140
 unload and now the body needs 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.760
 Workers around this truck charge too 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.890
 distribute and this work is in just 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.570
 these micronutrients yes and if he does 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.040
 Poor foods is the one that pays 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.760
 not so much vitamins minerals 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.619
 receive 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.210
 then you have the problem that yours 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.670
 body that can not handle 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.650
 now it is depending on the person 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.610
 a little different depending on the type 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.020
 one can not do anything with it 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.060
 us just directly as bold on the 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.460
 others can partially recycle and store 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.479
 as fat and getting your since even 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.490
 nothing to start with 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.470
 Generally it's just like that if you too 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.860
 little vitamins or minerals to you 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.750
 take then you have generally fast 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.369
 hungry again because your body says 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.530
 persistent yes, you have me now 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.119
 given a bunch but I 'm even there 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.770
 not continue with us even brings me 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.020
 nothing I need something with vitamins and 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.320
 Minerals yes that's why it really is 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.880
 very important in the first place 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.130
 to eat unprocessed organic fruit so 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.100
 fruits and vegetables green vegetables 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.890
 it is even like red vegetables when it comes to vegetables 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.450
 that is actually a cheat 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.799
 eat if you want it because you can 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.649
 you almost always eat so is 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.390
 always somehow a paprika something 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.069
 you can clatter the carrot 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.920
 Always eat when you are hungry 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.950
 yes and in vegetables are also great many 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.870
 minerals trainer a fruit you can do it 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.700
 of course, but there are more 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.440
 Vitamins in there and that's just really 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.540
 So it's really important 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.190
 Pay attention that you do not say helmut now 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.709
 I stop it and the main thing is mine 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.299
 my macros is right but that must 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.650
 just happen with vitamins too 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.360
 because as you said at the beginning 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.069
 otherwise you just miss the 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.140
 work for it on the construction site 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.940
 could clean up or could not continue 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.680
 achieves exactly the opposite 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.900
 She then pays attention to what you eat 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.549
 and increases the sly calorie count 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.709
 but not as your body 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.590
 can recycle is stored as fat 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.360
 yes or he just says as you said that you 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.000
 hunger you have hunger you are looking for 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.340
 and on and the page at once 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.720
 start and always hungry because stop 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.489
 simply these things are missing 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.930
 I just wanted to share that 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.549
 that she writes so that you know 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.440
 really on your micronutrients too 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.630
 Pay attention that they really are very 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.190
 are important to your stuff at all 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.780
 because that works 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.459
 It does not really work if you have that 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.829
 video has given me thumbs up 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.480
 but in the channels next video 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.480
 people also wear europe 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.450
 med
