00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
character

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.670 
character
I<00:01:13.729> know<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.760> wasn't<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.510> you<00:01:15.840> know<00:01:15.900> I'd<00:01:15.990> been<00:01:16.170> I'd

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.100 
I know I wasn't I you know I'd been I'd
say<00:01:16.950> read<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.640> little<00:01:17.909> bit<00:01:18.180> there<00:01:18.990> was<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:20.090> the

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
say read a little bit there was the the

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.969
