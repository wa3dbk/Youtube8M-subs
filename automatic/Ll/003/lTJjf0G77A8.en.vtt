00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
so now we gonna mount the piece that we

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.690 
so now we gonna mount the piece that we
just<00:00:03.149> meet<00:00:03.419> all<00:00:04.380> together<00:00:04.620> what<00:00:05.310> do<00:00:05.400> we<00:00:05.520> need

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
just meet all together what do we need

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.530 
just meet all together what do we need
the<00:00:06.450> carbon<00:00:06.839> rod<00:00:07.250> brushes<00:00:08.250> engine<00:00:08.730> connector

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
the carbon rod brushes engine connector

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.839 
the carbon rod brushes engine connector
of<00:00:09.690> course<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.830> metal<00:00:11.070> cross<00:00:11.340> that<00:00:11.550> we<00:00:11.670> just

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
of course the metal cross that we just

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.810 
of course the metal cross that we just
made<00:00:12.090> two<00:00:12.990> bolts<00:00:13.410> from<00:00:13.530> 12<00:00:13.950> millimeter<00:00:14.460> long

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
made two bolts from 12 millimeter long

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.560 
made two bolts from 12 millimeter long
three<00:00:15.480> millimeter<00:00:16.289> diameter<00:00:16.880> then<00:00:17.880> ten<00:00:18.330> to

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
three millimeter diameter then ten to

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.340 
three millimeter diameter then ten to
eight<00:00:18.779> millimeter<00:00:19.380> long<00:00:20.100> tree<00:00:20.580> diameter<00:00:20.789> and

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
eight millimeter long tree diameter and

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.170 
eight millimeter long tree diameter and
this<00:00:22.350> one<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.949> hold<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.670> connector<00:00:24.029> on<00:00:24.150> the

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
this one to hold the connector on the

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.429 
this one to hold the connector on the
rod<00:00:24.800> okay<00:00:25.800> first<00:00:26.490> step<00:00:29.779> put<00:00:30.779> some<00:00:30.960> Loctite<00:00:31.199> on

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
rod okay first step put some Loctite on

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.850 
rod okay first step put some Loctite on
there<00:00:33.770> that's<00:00:34.770> it

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.500 

slide<00:00:38.860> it<00:00:39.010> in<00:00:39.160> and<00:00:40.500> make<00:00:41.500> sure<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:43.210> you<00:00:43.360> hope

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
slide it in and make sure that you hope

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.820 
slide it in and make sure that you hope
the<00:00:43.690> wires<00:00:43.900> to<00:00:44.230> the<00:00:44.290> back

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:01:06.639 

cut<00:00:49.430> urns<00:00:49.670> in<00:00:51.280> the<00:00:52.280> other<00:00:52.580> one

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
will see we'll just have enough play or

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.730 
will see we'll just have enough play or
we<00:01:19.350> should<00:01:19.679> have<00:01:20.009> enough<00:01:20.670> plate<00:01:21.439> to<00:01:22.439> just

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
we should have enough plate to just

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.600 
we should have enough plate to just
slide<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.250> in

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
slide it in

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.899 
slide it in
okay<00:01:24.619> and<00:01:25.619> two<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:26.039> maybe<00:01:26.310> just<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.880> little

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
okay and two is maybe just a little

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.490 
okay and two is maybe just a little
tight<00:01:27.390> but<00:01:27.630> it's<00:01:28.500> really<00:01:29.960> okay<00:01:30.960> that's<00:01:31.259> what<00:01:31.470> I

now<00:01:56.550> tighten<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.330> until<00:01:58.110> really<00:01:58.710> arise<00:01:59.870> we

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
now tighten it until really arise we

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.660 
now tighten it until really arise we
want<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.230> to<00:02:01.350> be<00:02:01.530> just<00:02:01.950> in<00:02:02.160> the<00:02:02.220> middle

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
want it to be just in the middle

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.530 
want it to be just in the middle
almost<00:02:03.240> yep<00:02:04.140> that's<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.250> now<00:02:06.150> we<00:02:06.210> can

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
almost yep that's it and now we can

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:15.050 
almost yep that's it and now we can
tighten<00:02:07.580> sites<00:02:13.310> don't<00:02:14.310> fight<00:02:14.520> it<00:02:14.640> all<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.940> way

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
tighten sites don't fight it all the way

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.480 
tighten sites don't fight it all the way
do<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.510> step<00:02:15.780> by<00:02:15.810> step<00:02:18.860> make<00:02:19.860> sure<00:02:19.890> it's<00:02:20.220> really

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
do it step by step make sure it's really

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.870 
do it step by step make sure it's really
tight

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:34.910 

okay<00:02:28.770> that's<00:02:29.770> more<00:02:29.980> than<00:02:30.160> enough<00:02:31.260> okay

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.760 

that's<00:02:35.400> it<00:02:35.690> perfect<00:02:37.850> okay<00:02:38.850> next<00:02:39.420> step<00:02:39.810> slide

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
that's it perfect okay next step slide

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:49.220 
that's it perfect okay next step slide
it<00:02:40.920> on<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.130> rod

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:56.550 

but<00:02:49.890> something<00:02:50.159> uptight<00:02:50.489> on<00:02:50.670> there<00:02:50.909> too

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.850 

turn<00:02:57.560> it<00:02:57.680> up

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.590 

make<00:03:02.460> sure<00:03:02.700> in<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:02.910> meantime<00:03:03.090> that<00:03:03.480> your

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
make sure in the meantime that your

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.910 
make sure in the meantime that your
carbon<00:03:03.990> is<00:03:04.110> really<00:03:04.470> flush<00:03:04.920> with<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.520> edge

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
carbon is really flush with the edge

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.700 
carbon is really flush with the edge
okay<00:03:10.490> that's<00:03:11.490> it
