00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
we wanted to make it quite vague to

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.099 
we wanted to make it quite vague to
stimulate<00:02:57.700> the<00:02:57.819> mind<00:02:58.060> of<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:58.299> player<00:02:58.510> as<00:02:58.840> they

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
stimulate the mind of the player as they

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:09.449 
stimulate the mind of the player as they
go<00:02:59.260> through<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.620> game<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:08.680> concept<00:03:09.190> came

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
go through the game the concept came

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.400 
go through the game the concept came
first<00:03:09.819> from<00:03:10.000> an<00:03:10.180> on-screen<00:03:10.569> perspective<00:03:11.319> of

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
first from an on-screen perspective of

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.350

and<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:14.020> friend<00:03:14.290> of<00:03:14.380> the<00:03:14.410> horse<00:03:14.680> comparing

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
and the friend of the horse comparing

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.830 
and the friend of the horse comparing
different<00:03:15.700> size<00:03:16.180> height<00:03:16.750> girth<00:03:17.260> and<00:03:17.590> so<00:03:17.830> on<00:03:18.840> so

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
different size height girth and so on so

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.450 
different size height girth and so on so
that<00:03:20.050> was<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.410> aspect<00:03:20.620> we<00:03:20.890> focused<00:03:21.280> on

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
that was the aspect we focused on

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.360 
that was the aspect we focused on
initially<00:03:22.650> later<00:03:23.650> we<00:03:23.920> wanted<00:03:24.190> to<00:03:24.250> create

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
initially later we wanted to create

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.220 
initially later we wanted to create
something<00:03:24.760> visually<00:03:25.360> which<00:03:25.930> would<00:03:26.080> have<00:03:26.200> a

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
something visually which would have a

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.740 
something visually which would have a
huge<00:03:26.500> impact<00:03:27.010> and<00:03:27.370> would<00:03:27.940> best<00:03:28.150> utilize<00:03:28.600> the

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
huge impact and would best utilize the

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.780 
huge impact and would best utilize the
horse<00:03:28.960> and<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.410> game<00:03:29.590> in<00:03:29.890> collaboration<00:03:30.760> with

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
horse and the game in collaboration with

we hope those feelings are transferred

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.560 
we hope those feelings are transferred
through<00:04:25.010> the<00:04:25.280> character<00:04:25.760> when<00:04:26.270> the<00:04:26.389> player

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
through the character when the player

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:51.990 
through the character when the player
plays<00:04:26.870> the<00:04:27.050> game

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000

of the game in physical terms would be
comparable<00:04:59.540> to<00:04:59.810> somewhere<00:05:00.110> like<00:05:00.170> Tokyo<00:05:00.910> so
