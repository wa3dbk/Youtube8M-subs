cutter<00:00:45.899> set<00:00:46.379> which<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.190> using<00:00:48.030> mini<00:00:48.180> one<00:00:48.329> which

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
cutter set which is using mini one which

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.340 
cutter set which is using mini one which
I'm<00:00:48.629> going<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.780> use<00:00:48.840> for<00:00:49.050> something<00:00:49.200> else

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
I'm going to use for something else

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.690 
I'm going to use for something else
later<00:00:49.559> but<00:00:50.190> there<00:00:50.309> are<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.430> whole<00:00:50.550> lot<00:00:50.670> of

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
later but there are a whole lot of

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.389 
later but there are a whole lot of
little<00:00:50.969> cutters<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:52.050> they<00:00:52.620> come<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.039> little

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
little cutters and they come in a little

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.049 
little cutters and they come in a little
tin<00:00:54.620> to<00:00:55.620> looks<00:00:55.800> like<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.190> it's<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.670> bit<00:00:56.789> bigger

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
tin to looks like that it's a bit bigger

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.139 
tin to looks like that it's a bit bigger
for<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.719> larger<00:00:58.260> size<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.850> then<00:00:59.850> you<00:00:59.940> just

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
for the larger size and then you just

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.369 
for the larger size and then you just
cut<00:01:00.300> out<00:01:00.420> your<00:01:00.600> four<00:01:00.750> petals<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.289> I've<00:01:01.350> just

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
cut out your four petals so I've just

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.009 
cut out your four petals so I've just
done<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> few<00:01:01.920> here<00:01:02.129> earlier<00:01:02.520> but<00:01:02.870> I'm<00:01:03.870> gonna

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
done a few here earlier but I'm gonna

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:11.200 
done a few here earlier but I'm gonna
use<00:01:04.199> them<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.470> minute<00:01:06.770> three<00:01:08.479> four<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.869> five

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
use them in a minute three four and five

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.520 
use them in a minute three four and five
I'm<00:01:12.210> careful<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.630> press<00:01:12.810> these<00:01:12.990> out<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:13.229> that

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
I'm careful to press these out so that

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.810 
I'm careful to press these out so that
they<00:01:13.619> don't<00:01:13.740> get<00:01:13.920> marked<00:01:14.280> Oh<00:01:14.600> funny<00:01:15.600> done<00:01:15.780> for

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
they don't get marked Oh funny done for

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.810 
they don't get marked Oh funny done for
as<00:01:17.820> they<00:01:18.060> go<00:01:18.920> because<00:01:19.920> if<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.100> stick<00:01:20.580> them<00:01:20.670> out

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
as they go because if you stick them out

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.300 
as they go because if you stick them out
too<00:01:21.060> hard<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:22.080> might<00:01:22.229> actually<00:01:22.380> put<00:01:22.650> nail

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
too hard you might actually put nail

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.710 
too hard you might actually put nail
marks<00:01:23.700> or<00:01:23.820> anything<00:01:24.000> right<00:01:24.210> for<00:01:24.270> your<00:01:24.479> hands

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
marks or anything right for your hands

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.380 
marks or anything right for your hands
are<00:01:24.810> nice<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.110> clean<00:01:26.030> you<00:01:27.030> should<00:01:27.060> actually

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
are nice and clean you should actually

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.710 
are nice and clean you should actually
wrap<00:01:27.720> your<00:01:28.520> icing<00:01:29.520> sugar<00:01:29.700> up<00:01:29.939> as<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.150> go<00:01:30.450> I'm

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
wrap your icing sugar up as I go I'm

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.499 
wrap your icing sugar up as I go I'm
just<00:01:30.780> doing<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.320> really<00:01:31.619> quickly<00:01:32.390> then<00:01:33.390> I

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
just doing this really quickly then I

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.870 
just doing this really quickly then I
actually<00:01:33.840> because<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.220> not<00:01:35.310> exactly<00:01:35.700> the

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
actually because this is not exactly the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.819 
actually because this is not exactly the
Layton<00:01:36.270> shape<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.810> want<00:01:36.960> my<00:01:37.110> flower<00:01:37.439> petal

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
Layton shape that I want my flower petal

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.240 
Layton shape that I want my flower petal
so<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.400> just<00:01:38.670> roll<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.970> out<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.210> here<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:40.250> from

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
so I just roll it out of here and from

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.740 
so I just roll it out of here and from
the<00:01:41.369> end<00:01:41.579> make<00:01:41.939> sure<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.210> use<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.479> end<00:01:42.630> it

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
the end make sure you use the end it

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.940 
the end make sure you use the end it
you're<00:01:42.899> going<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.049> squish<00:01:43.350> up<00:01:43.470> anyway<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:43.799> it

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
you're going to squish up anyway so it

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.429 
you're going to squish up anyway so it
doesn't<00:01:43.979> matter<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.430> doesn't<00:01:44.579> mark<00:01:44.850> the

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
doesn't matter it doesn't mark the

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:51.080 
doesn't matter it doesn't mark the
flower<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:47.990> just<00:01:48.990> roll<00:01:49.170> these<00:01:49.320> out<00:01:50.090> till

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
flower I just roll these out till

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
flower I just roll these out till
they're<00:01:51.210> all<00:01:51.299> about<00:01:51.509> even

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.200 

I'm<00:01:56.920> doing<00:01:57.190> this<00:01:57.310> quickly<00:01:57.490> you<00:01:57.880> might<00:01:58.000> want<00:01:58.150> to

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
I'm doing this quickly you might want to

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.570 
I'm doing this quickly you might want to
take<00:01:58.360> more<00:01:58.570> time<00:01:58.780> and<00:01:59.130> you<00:02:00.130> might<00:02:00.250> be<00:02:00.430> a<00:02:00.460> little

sure that you're making them fairly even

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:09.059 
sure that you're making them fairly even
at<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.880> top<00:02:59.430> as<00:03:00.430> you<00:03:00.489> go<00:03:00.700> around

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.640 

we've<00:03:10.069> got<00:03:10.190> them<00:03:10.280> all<00:03:10.340> in<00:03:10.400> place<00:03:11.620> you<00:03:12.620> just

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
we've got them all in place you just

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.470 
we've got them all in place you just
press<00:03:13.040> that<00:03:13.069> little<00:03:13.370> bit<00:03:13.489> in<00:03:13.580> the<00:03:13.640> middle<00:03:13.849> just

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
press that little bit in the middle just

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.559 
press that little bit in the middle just
helps<00:03:14.780> them<00:03:14.900> when<00:03:15.260> you<00:03:15.379> go<00:03:15.799> to<00:03:15.860> curl<00:03:16.129> them<00:03:16.280> up

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
helps them when you go to curl them up

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.610 
helps them when you go to curl them up
just<00:03:17.569> bring<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:17.930> water<00:03:18.110> along<00:03:18.379> the<00:03:18.500> edge

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
just bring the water along the edge

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.869 
just bring the water along the edge
there<00:03:18.650> so<00:03:18.890> it's<00:03:19.129> ready<00:03:19.370> to<00:03:19.400> stick<00:03:19.730> on<00:03:19.819> the

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
there so it's ready to stick on the

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:24.789 
there so it's ready to stick on the
other<00:03:20.000> side<00:03:20.269> and<00:03:20.780> you<00:03:21.769> curl<00:03:21.980> them<00:03:22.129> around<00:03:23.799> this

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
other side and you curl them around this

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.170 
other side and you curl them around this
is<00:03:24.950> probably<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.310> fiddly<00:03:25.610> bit<00:03:25.909> but<00:03:26.060> it's

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
is probably the fiddly bit but it's

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.479 
is probably the fiddly bit but it's
actually<00:03:26.450> not<00:03:26.510> very<00:03:26.659> hard<00:03:26.989> it<00:03:27.950> just<00:03:28.010> depends

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
actually not very hard it just depends

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.069 
actually not very hard it just depends
on<00:03:28.549> how<00:03:28.610> tight<00:03:29.000> you<00:03:29.180> curl<00:03:29.390> it<00:03:29.420> how<00:03:29.750> you<00:03:29.810> want

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
on how tight you curl it how you want

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:31.809 
on how tight you curl it how you want
your<00:03:30.260> thing<00:03:30.890> and<00:03:31.010> then<00:03:31.069> you<00:03:31.220> just<00:03:31.400> squish<00:03:31.579> that

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
your thing and then you just squish that

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.330 
your thing and then you just squish that
together<00:03:32.409> and<00:03:33.409> you<00:03:33.799> can<00:03:33.920> play<00:03:34.099> with<00:03:34.250> your

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
together and you can play with your

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.740 
together and you can play with your
leaves<00:03:34.519> just<00:03:34.790> make<00:03:34.970> sure<00:03:35.120> that<00:03:35.239> even<00:03:35.569> or

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
leaves just make sure that even or

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.350 
leaves just make sure that even or
whatever<00:03:36.140> you<00:03:36.670> need<00:03:37.670> to<00:03:37.760> do<00:03:37.940> that<00:03:38.120> one's<00:03:38.269> a

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
whatever you need to do that one's a

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.300 
whatever you need to do that one's a
little<00:03:38.599> bit<00:03:38.690> uneven<00:03:38.930> but<00:03:39.230> anyway<00:03:39.530> and<00:03:39.859> then<00:03:40.220> I

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
little bit uneven but anyway and then I

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.170 
little bit uneven but anyway and then I
just<00:03:40.519> get<00:03:40.760> a<00:03:41.709> little<00:03:42.709> tub<00:03:42.859> of<00:03:42.890> flour<00:03:43.190> ready<00:03:44.030> put

not quite dry usually best to wait until

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.000

white now these are dusts I put some

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.180 
white now these are dusts I put some
dust<00:04:14.329> on<00:04:14.569> my<00:04:14.810> brush<00:04:15.349> and<00:04:15.590> I<00:04:15.680> you<00:04:15.739> should<00:04:15.950> put<00:04:16.099> it

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
dust on my brush and I you should put it

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.740 
dust on my brush and I you should put it
in<00:04:16.250> the<00:04:16.400> lid<00:04:16.609> because<00:04:17.090> then<00:04:17.299> you<00:04:17.389> don't<00:04:17.510> get<00:04:17.690> a

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
in the lid because then you don't get a

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.509 
in the lid because then you don't get a
huge<00:04:18.200> amount<00:04:18.560> and<00:04:18.709> I'm<00:04:18.799> bashing<00:04:19.070> around<00:04:19.370> in<00:04:19.459> a

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
huge amount and I'm bashing around in a

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.980 
huge amount and I'm bashing around in a
little<00:04:19.729> bit<00:04:19.849> then<00:04:20.389> you<00:04:20.479> just<00:04:20.690> poke<00:04:21.470> it<00:04:21.500> in<00:04:21.769> here

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
little bit then you just poke it in here

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.750 
little bit then you just poke it in here
and<00:04:23.990> maybe<00:04:24.620> get<00:04:24.830> a<00:04:24.860> little<00:04:25.010> bit<00:04:25.099> more<00:04:25.220> dust<00:04:25.490> but

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
and maybe get a little bit more dust but

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.520 
and maybe get a little bit more dust but
again<00:04:25.970> I<00:04:26.000> drop<00:04:26.539> it<00:04:26.660> into<00:04:26.810> the<00:04:26.960> lid<00:04:27.110> so<00:04:27.320> I'm<00:04:27.380> not

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
again I drop it into the lid so I'm not

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.480 
again I drop it into the lid so I'm not
overdoing<00:04:27.979> it<00:04:29.289> you<00:04:30.289> just<00:04:30.500> see<00:04:31.039> it's<00:04:31.160> a<00:04:31.190> bit<00:04:31.340> wet

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
overdoing it you just see it's a bit wet

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.279 
overdoing it you just see it's a bit wet
you<00:04:31.669> need<00:04:31.820> to<00:04:31.910> wait<00:04:32.060> until<00:04:32.240> it's<00:04:32.389> dry<00:04:32.510> because

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
you need to wait until it's dry because

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:34.690 
you need to wait until it's dry because
it<00:04:33.410> doesn't<00:04:33.680> it<00:04:33.800> sticks<00:04:34.099> otherwise<00:04:34.400> but<00:04:34.610> in

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
it doesn't it sticks otherwise but in

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.689 
it doesn't it sticks otherwise but in
where<00:04:34.849> you<00:04:34.970> paste<00:04:35.210> it<00:04:35.510> these<00:04:36.320> you<00:04:36.860> are<00:04:37.070> dusted

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699 
where you paste it these you are dusted

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:39.730 
where you paste it these you are dusted
in<00:04:37.820> there<00:04:38.000> and<00:04:38.300> best<00:04:39.229> wait<00:04:39.410> till<00:04:39.530> it<00:04:39.620> dries

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
in there and best wait till it dries

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.469 
in there and best wait till it dries
because<00:04:39.979> it<00:04:40.070> doesn't<00:04:40.280> go<00:04:40.340> streaky<00:04:40.729> as<00:04:40.880> I've

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
because it doesn't go streaky as I've

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:42.580 
because it doesn't go streaky as I've
done<00:04:41.570> with<00:04:41.780> those<00:04:41.930> ones<00:04:42.169> that<00:04:42.260> were<00:04:42.440> already

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
done with those ones that were already

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.650 
done with those ones that were already
dry<00:04:42.970> now<00:04:43.970> you<00:04:44.030> have<00:04:44.240> it<00:04:44.360> easy<00:04:44.810> as<00:04:45.169> can<00:04:45.590> be
