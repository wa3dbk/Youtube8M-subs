halfway to be fair think the fare is
that<00:01:43.159> you<00:01:43.250> use<00:01:43.490> it<00:01:43.640> to<00:01:43.729> take<00:01:43.909> over

millennium<00:01:45.920> of<00:01:46.280> the<00:01:46.400> more<00:01:46.549> darkness<00:01:47.000> all

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
millennium of the more darkness all

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.870
