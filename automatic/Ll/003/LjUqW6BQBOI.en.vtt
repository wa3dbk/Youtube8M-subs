10% per second until it is fired or you
switch<00:02:43.030> weapons<00:02:43.480> it<00:02:44.380> should<00:02:44.590> be<00:02:44.739> noted<00:02:45.040> that

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
switch weapons it should be noted that

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.460 
switch weapons it should be noted that
even<00:02:45.430> if<00:02:45.520> there<00:02:45.670> is<00:02:45.790> only<00:02:45.910> 1%<00:02:46.360> in<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:47.110> battery

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470

even if there is only 1% in the battery
left<00:02:47.770> you<00:02:48.310> can<00:02:48.489> still<00:02:48.760> charge<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:49.270> shot<00:02:49.540> but<00:02:50.080> it

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
left you can still charge a shot but it

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.140 
left you can still charge a shot but it
will<00:02:50.470> fire<00:02:50.680> almost<00:02:51.190> immediately<00:02:51.670> you<00:02:52.000> should

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
will fire almost immediately you should

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.520 
will fire almost immediately you should
also<00:02:52.360> remember<00:02:52.660> that<00:02:52.989> if<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.230> battery

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
also remember that if the battery

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.620 
also remember that if the battery
reaches<00:02:53.950> 0%<00:02:54.220> while<00:02:54.700> you<00:02:54.820> are<00:02:54.940> charging<00:02:55.239> a<00:02:55.390> shot

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
reaches 0% while you are charging a shot

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.060 
reaches 0% while you are charging a shot
it<00:02:55.840> will<00:02:56.200> automatically<00:02:56.860> fire<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:59.680> plasma

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070
