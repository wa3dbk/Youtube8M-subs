00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.690 
started out by saying the 4.3 untethered
jailbreak<00:00:36.030> could<00:00:36.719> come<00:00:36.960> from<00:00:37.170> many<00:00:37.290> sources

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700

comex<00:00:41.550> are<00:00:41.760> three<00:00:42.300> possibilities<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.320> then

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
comex are three possibilities and then

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.250 
comex are three possibilities and then
he<00:00:43.770> said<00:00:43.950> maybe<00:00:44.430> more<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.000> then<00:00:45.450> commack<00:00:45.960> said

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260

tomorrow<00:00:48.750> how<00:00:49.590> will<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.460> osb<00:00:51.120> pwned<00:00:51.449> which

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
tomorrow how will I osb pwned which

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.110 
tomorrow how will I osb pwned which
means<00:00:52.140> they<00:00:52.530> will<00:00:52.739> determine<00:00:53.250> how<00:00:53.489> they<00:00:53.969> will

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
means they will determine how they will

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.319 
means they will determine how they will
actually<00:00:54.329> jailbreak<00:00:55.020> iOS<00:00:55.559> 4.3<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.670> then<00:00:57.120> he

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
actually jailbreak iOS 4.3 and then he

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.590 
actually jailbreak iOS 4.3 and then he

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
least see if the shatter exploit still

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.429 
least see if the shatter exploit still
works<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.549> ipad<00:01:11.909> 2<00:01:12.240> which<00:01:12.869> was<00:01:13.260> the

to<00:01:16.680> save<00:01:17.040> until<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:18.060> next<00:01:18.360> generation

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
to save until the next generation

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.020 
to save until the next generation
devices<00:01:19.200> which<00:01:19.500> would<00:01:19.710> be<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.009> ipad<00:01:20.520> 2<00:01:20.790> and

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
devices which would be the ipad 2 and

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.090 
devices which would be the ipad 2 and
the<00:01:21.180> iphone<00:01:21.630> 5<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.470> they're<00:01:22.650> going<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.830> see<00:01:23.009> if

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
the iphone 5 so they're going to see if

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.980 
the iphone 5 so they're going to see if
that'll<00:01:23.310> work<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.850> if<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.180> doesn't<00:01:24.570> work<00:01:24.600> or

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
that'll work and if that doesn't work or

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.929 
that'll work and if that doesn't work or
if<00:01:25.320> they<00:01:25.439> want<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.770> save<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.280> then<00:01:26.729> he's

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
if they want to save that then he's

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.219 
if they want to save that then he's
going<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.119> try<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.330> find<00:01:27.570> some<00:01:27.750> user<00:01:27.960> land

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
going to try and find some user land

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.770 
going to try and find some user land
exploits<00:01:28.860> which<00:01:29.340> will<00:01:29.549> only<00:01:29.790> work<00:01:30.119> once<00:01:30.540> and

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
exploits which will only work once and

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.649 
exploits which will only work once and
it<00:01:30.869> will<00:01:31.049> only<00:01:31.259> work<00:01:31.560> on<00:01:31.710> 4.3<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:33.119> hopefully

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
it will only work on 4.3 so hopefully

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.030 
it will only work on 4.3 so hopefully
that<00:01:33.840> will<00:01:33.960> end<00:01:34.140> up<00:01:34.290> being<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.590> case<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:34.950> they

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
that will end up being the case so they

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.190 
that will end up being the case so they
can<00:01:35.220> save<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.670> shattered<00:01:36.030> exploit<00:01:36.509> if<00:01:36.720> the

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
can save the shattered exploit if the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.020 
can save the shattered exploit if the
ipad<00:01:37.590> 2<00:01:37.799> still<00:01:38.100> contains<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.700> shattered

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
ipad 2 still contains the shattered

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.330 
ipad 2 still contains the shattered
exploit<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:39.990> then<00:01:40.500> he<00:01:40.680> also<00:01:40.890> said

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
exploit that is and then he also said

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.310 
exploit that is and then he also said
and<00:01:41.549> i<00:01:41.939> have<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.270> do<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.450> remotely<00:01:42.780> since<00:01:43.170> i'm

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320
