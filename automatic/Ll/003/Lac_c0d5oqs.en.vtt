00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
think number one determining factor has

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.650 
think number one determining factor has
it<00:02:45.739> got<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:45.950> be<00:02:46.160> percent<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:47.060> that<00:02:47.420> is<00:02:47.540> why

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
it got to be percent and that is why

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.720 
it got to be percent and that is why
it's<00:02:47.810> so<00:02:47.900> important<00:02:48.590> to<00:02:48.650> know<00:02:48.860> your<00:02:48.890> off<00:02:49.430> for

say this is even it's very very close

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.420 
say this is even it's very very close
match<00:06:19.820> very<00:06:20.300> close<00:06:20.690> I<00:06:21.050> think<00:06:21.890> the<00:06:21.980> Falcon<00:06:22.340> was

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
match very close I think the Falcon was

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.070 
match very close I think the Falcon was
a<00:06:22.490> good<00:06:22.610> choice<00:06:22.760> which<00:06:23.090> I<00:06:23.180> know<00:06:23.240> yeah<00:06:23.720> like

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
a good choice which I know yeah like

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.810 
a good choice which I know yeah like
I've<00:06:24.260> been<00:06:24.320> impressed<00:06:24.490> and<00:06:25.490> so<00:06:25.640> that<00:06:25.760> the

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:25.820 
I've been impressed and so that the

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.550 
I've been impressed and so that the
Falco<00:06:26.270> has<00:06:26.450> made<00:06:26.690> the<00:06:26.810> difference<00:06:27.020> I<00:06:27.320> think

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 
Falco has made the difference I think

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.740 
Falco has made the difference I think
it's<00:06:27.710> the<00:06:27.740> taco<00:06:28.130> fox<00:06:28.400> vs<00:06:28.820> fox<00:06:29.030> fox<00:06:29.330> it<00:06:29.540> is<00:06:29.630> made

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750 
it's the taco fox vs fox fox it is made

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.110 
it's the taco fox vs fox fox it is made
a<00:06:29.780> difference<00:06:30.169> yeah<00:06:30.290> yeah<00:06:30.890> okay<00:06:31.490> this<00:06:31.940> is

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 
a difference yeah yeah okay this is

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.250
