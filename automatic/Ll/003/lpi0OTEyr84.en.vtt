someone<00:00:04.890> was<00:00:05.009> asking<00:00:05.330> how<00:00:06.330> to<00:00:06.390> do<00:00:06.690> that<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:07.319> so

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
someone was asking how to do that and so

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.629 
someone was asking how to do that and so
I<00:00:07.589> thought<00:00:07.830> I<00:00:07.890> would<00:00:08.040> make<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:08.250> really<00:00:08.429> quick

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
I thought I would make a really quick

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.490 
I thought I would make a really quick
video<00:00:08.849> on<00:00:09.179> how<00:00:09.300> to<00:00:09.330> do<00:00:09.570> it<00:00:09.599> rather<00:00:09.960> than<00:00:10.110> trying

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
video on how to do it rather than trying

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.850 
video on how to do it rather than trying
to<00:00:10.620> type<00:00:10.920> it<00:00:11.099> out<00:00:11.210> so<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.540> just<00:00:12.960> opened<00:00:13.469> my

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
to type it out so I just opened my

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.730 
to type it out so I just opened my
Photoshop<00:00:14.519> template<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.599> colored<00:00:16.410> my

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
Photoshop template and I colored my

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.769 
Photoshop template and I colored my
background<00:00:17.220> color<00:00:17.520> so<00:00:17.850> that<00:00:17.880> you<00:00:18.029> could<00:00:18.390> see<00:00:18.750> a

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
background color so that you could see a

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.849 
background color so that you could see a
little<00:00:19.050> bit<00:00:19.230> easier<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:21.590> these<00:00:22.590> are<00:00:22.740> my

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
little bit easier and these are my

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.179 
little bit easier and these are my
layers<00:00:23.460> here<00:00:24.029> this<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.510> layers<00:00:24.689> palette

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
layers here this is the layers palette

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.009 
layers here this is the layers palette
which<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.340> important<00:00:26.820> for<00:00:26.880> coloring<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.599> tear

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
which is important for coloring a tear

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.019 
which is important for coloring a tear
you<00:00:28.380> need<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.680> be<00:00:29.130> able<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.429> select<00:00:29.580> when<00:00:29.910> your

layers palettes and I'm just going to

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.090 
layers palettes and I'm just going to
move<00:00:31.920> this<00:00:32.160> down<00:00:33.050> and<00:00:34.050> then<00:00:34.739> I'm<00:00:34.860> going<00:00:35.010> to

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
move this down and then I'm going to

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.310 
move this down and then I'm going to
color<00:00:35.280> each<00:00:35.640> one<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:36.000> these<00:00:36.140> tears<00:00:37.140> a

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
color each one of these tears a

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.830 
color each one of these tears a
different<00:00:37.829> color<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:39.239> way<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.690> do

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
different color and the way that you do

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.410 
different color and the way that you do
it<00:00:39.960> first<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.770> choose<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.190> color<00:00:41.219> top<00:00:42.120> layer<00:00:42.390> is

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
it first is choose a color top layer is

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.990 
it first is choose a color top layer is
whatever<00:00:43.020> color<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:43.950> want<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.280> be<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:44.910> I'm

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
whatever color you want it to be so I'm

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.170

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
going to let's say we're gonna create a

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.400 
going to let's say we're gonna create a
gradient<00:00:48.739> so<00:00:49.739> I'm<00:00:49.800> gonna<00:00:49.950> choose<00:00:50.280> like<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:51.410> kind

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
gradient so I'm gonna choose like a kind

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.790 
gradient so I'm gonna choose like a kind
of<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.559> purpley<00:00:53.010> color<00:00:53.219> here<00:00:53.520> let's<00:00:54.270> go<00:00:54.360> there

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
okay and then I'm going to go to my

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.970 
okay and then I'm going to go to my
layer<00:00:59.550> one<00:00:59.910> which<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.780> my<00:01:00.989> bottom<00:01:01.350> tier<00:01:01.680> you

below<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.790> layer<00:01:51.619> so<00:01:52.619> we<00:01:52.740> move<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.159> below<00:01:53.490> by

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
below the layer so we move that below by

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.600 
below the layer so we move that below by
just<00:01:53.939> clicking<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.420> dragging<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:54.960> it's<00:01:55.079> below

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
just clicking and dragging so it's below

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.010 
just clicking and dragging so it's below
so<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:56.759> is<00:01:56.880> an<00:01:57.000> invisible<00:01:57.450> layer<00:01:57.600> right<00:01:57.840> now

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
so this is an invisible layer right now

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.999 
so this is an invisible layer right now
there's<00:01:58.290> nothing<00:01:58.500> on<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.860> I'm<00:01:59.360> going<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:01.009> turn

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
there's nothing on it I'm going to turn

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.889 
there's nothing on it I'm going to turn
off<00:02:02.280> my<00:02:02.689> layer<00:02:03.689> one<00:02:05.149> but<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.390> see<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.719> it's

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
off my layer one but you see that it's

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.199 
off my layer one but you see that it's
still<00:02:07.170> selected<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:08.069> I'm<00:02:08.610> going<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:08.940> click<00:02:09.179> on

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.449 
still selected and I'm going to click on
the<00:02:09.539> layer<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:10.020> just<00:02:10.410> made<00:02:10.679> which<00:02:11.069> is<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.340> new

I'm going to turn my layer one back on
by<00:02:57.550> clicking<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.970> eyeball<00:02:58.330> and<00:02:58.570> you<00:02:58.750> can't

see the purple behind it right now

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.970 
see the purple behind it right now
now<00:03:01.480> this<00:03:01.690> little<00:03:01.959> drop-down<00:03:02.230> menu<00:03:02.800> right

now this little drop-down menu right
here<00:03:03.010> in<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.610> layers<00:03:03.820> palette<00:03:04.680> tells

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
here in the layers palette tells

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.490 
here in the layers palette tells
Photoshop<00:03:06.160> what<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.180> blending<00:03:07.690> mode<00:03:07.930> is<00:03:08.260> of

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
Photoshop what the blending mode is of

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.960 
Photoshop what the blending mode is of
each<00:03:08.680> one<00:03:08.890> of<00:03:09.010> these<00:03:09.160> layers<00:03:09.400> so<00:03:09.730> a<00:03:09.760> great

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
each one of these layers so a great

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.910 
each one of these layers so a great
thing<00:03:10.000> to<00:03:10.270> do<00:03:10.420> is<00:03:10.720> kind<00:03:11.080> of<00:03:11.140> experiment<00:03:11.800> with

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
thing to do is kind of experiment with

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.920 
thing to do is kind of experiment with
these<00:03:12.100> different<00:03:12.640> things<00:03:13.390> when<00:03:13.660> you<00:03:13.750> have

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
these different things when you have

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.449 
these different things when you have
time<00:03:14.230> but<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.739> one<00:03:14.860> we<00:03:15.040> want<00:03:15.220> to<00:03:15.340> pay

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
time but the one we want to pay

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.430 
time but the one we want to pay
attention<00:03:15.489> to<00:03:15.970> right<00:03:16.120> now<00:03:16.299> is<00:03:16.600> multiply<00:03:17.110> and

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
attention to right now is multiply and

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.550 
attention to right now is multiply and
what<00:03:17.980> that<00:03:18.130> basically<00:03:18.310> says<00:03:18.820> is<00:03:19.560> Photoshop

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
what that basically says is Photoshop

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.580 
what that basically says is Photoshop
tells<00:03:20.910> this<00:03:21.910> layer<00:03:22.450> that<00:03:22.900> everything<00:03:23.350> that<00:03:23.470> is

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
tells this layer that everything that is

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.850 
tells this layer that everything that is
white<00:03:23.860> is<00:03:24.190> invisible<00:03:25.090> so<00:03:25.959> you<00:03:25.989> press<00:03:26.260> multiply

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
white is invisible so you press multiply

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.070 
white is invisible so you press multiply
so<00:03:27.790> everything<00:03:28.239> that<00:03:28.269> was<00:03:28.510> white<00:03:28.810> on<00:03:29.049> that

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
so everything that was white on that

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.009 
so everything that was white on that
tear<00:03:29.890> is<00:03:30.130> now<00:03:30.519> invisible<00:03:31.120> but<00:03:31.360> the<00:03:31.480> shadows

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
tear is now invisible but the shadows

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.289 
tear is now invisible but the shadows
you<00:03:32.049> can<00:03:32.560> still<00:03:32.799> kind<00:03:32.980> of<00:03:33.130> see<00:03:33.190> so<00:03:33.820> now<00:03:34.060> your

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
you can still kind of see so now your

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:39.210 
you can still kind of see so now your
coloured<00:03:34.720> tier<00:03:35.049> has<00:03:35.380> the<00:03:35.680> definition<00:03:36.209> that<00:03:38.220> on

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
coloured tier has the definition that on

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.850 
coloured tier has the definition that on
top<00:03:39.519> of<00:03:39.580> the<00:03:39.850> color<00:03:40.060> so<00:03:40.360> basically<00:03:40.720> these<00:03:41.110> two

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
top of the color so basically these two

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.170 
top of the color so basically these two
layers<00:03:42.310> creates<00:03:43.180> the<00:03:43.450> look<00:03:43.600> of<00:03:43.810> one<00:03:44.079> layer<00:03:44.380> and

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
layers creates the look of one layer and

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.979 
layers creates the look of one layer and
to<00:03:46.180> adjust<00:03:46.600> the<00:03:46.870> darkness<00:03:47.140> of<00:03:47.590> this<00:03:47.739> shadow<00:03:48.989> I

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
to adjust the darkness of this shadow I

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.490 
to adjust the darkness of this shadow I
could<00:03:50.590> go<00:03:50.709> up<00:03:50.950> to<00:03:50.980> image<00:03:51.840> adjustments<00:03:52.840> curves

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
could go up to image adjustments curves

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.640 
could go up to image adjustments curves
and<00:03:54.329> I<00:03:55.329> can<00:03:55.510> adjust<00:03:55.810> these<00:03:56.079> a<00:03:56.140> little<00:03:56.440> play

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
and I can adjust these a little play

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.680 
and I can adjust these a little play
with<00:03:56.680> these<00:03:56.920> curves<00:03:57.340> here<00:03:57.670> and<00:03:57.880> this

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
with these curves here and this

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.680 
with these curves here and this
basically<00:03:59.350> when<00:03:59.560> you<00:03:59.620> pull<00:03:59.860> down<00:04:00.690> it

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
basically when you pull down it

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.229 
basically when you pull down it
increases<00:04:02.380> the<00:04:02.680> shadow<00:04:02.950> and<00:04:03.340> when<00:04:03.880> you<00:04:04.000> pull

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
increases the shadow and when you pull

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.259 
increases the shadow and when you pull
up<00:04:04.269> it<00:04:05.140> decreases<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:05.920> shadow<00:04:06.280> so<00:04:07.030> if<00:04:07.120> you

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
up it decreases the shadow so if you

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.840 
up it decreases the shadow so if you
want<00:04:07.540> more<00:04:07.780> contrast<00:04:08.530> you<00:04:09.340> can<00:04:09.519> pull<00:04:09.730> that

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
want more contrast you can pull that

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.650 
want more contrast you can pull that
down<00:04:11.370> so<00:04:12.370> I'm<00:04:12.489> going<00:04:12.640> to<00:04:12.730> go<00:04:12.880> through<00:04:13.209> and<00:04:13.450> do

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
down so I'm going to go through and do

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.500 
down so I'm going to go through and do
the<00:04:14.410> rest<00:04:14.560> of<00:04:14.799> these<00:04:14.950> layers<00:04:15.700> just<00:04:16.239> so<00:04:16.329> that

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
the rest of these layers just so that

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.680 
the rest of these layers just so that
you<00:04:16.750> can<00:04:17.489> you<00:04:18.489> know<00:04:18.579> understand<00:04:19.209> the<00:04:19.299> process

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
you can you know understand the process

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.740 
you can you know understand the process
so<00:04:20.470> again<00:04:20.799> I'm<00:04:21.070> going<00:04:21.310> to<00:04:21.430> my<00:04:21.520> next<00:04:22.410> layer<00:04:23.410> here

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
so again I'm going to my next layer here

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.890 
so again I'm going to my next layer here
and<00:04:25.380> I'm<00:04:25.560> gonna<00:04:25.650> choose<00:04:25.920> my<00:04:25.980> color<00:04:26.340> first<00:04:26.900> I'm

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
and I'm gonna choose my color first I'm

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.840 
and I'm gonna choose my color first I'm
just<00:04:28.050> gonna<00:04:28.140> move<00:04:28.410> up<00:04:28.680> slightly<00:04:29.100> and<00:04:29.580> I'm<00:04:29.700> not

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
just gonna move up slightly and I'm not

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.250 
just gonna move up slightly and I'm not
gonna<00:04:30.030> move<00:04:30.120> this<00:04:30.300> around<00:04:30.450> I'm<00:04:31.020> just<00:04:31.170> gonna

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
gonna move this around I'm just gonna

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.620 
gonna move this around I'm just gonna
kind<00:04:31.590> of<00:04:31.710> keep<00:04:32.250> it<00:04:32.430> in<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:32.610> same<00:04:32.850> tonal<00:04:33.360> range

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
kind of keep it in the same tonal range

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.080 
kind of keep it in the same tonal range
but<00:04:34.050> by<00:04:34.230> moving<00:04:34.770> the<00:04:35.070> slider<00:04:35.400> it<00:04:35.730> chooses<00:04:36.060> a

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
but by moving the slider it chooses a

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.230 
but by moving the slider it chooses a
new<00:04:36.300> color<00:04:36.540> but<00:04:36.780> keeps<00:04:36.960> it<00:04:37.110> in<00:04:37.200> the<00:04:37.260> same<00:04:37.470> tone

once<00:06:40.750> you<00:06:40.930> know<00:06:41.080> what<00:06:41.260> you're<00:06:41.500> doing<00:06:42.160> and<00:06:44.190> one

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:45.190 
once you know what you're doing and one

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.250 
once you know what you're doing and one
other<00:06:45.340> thing<00:06:45.460> somebody<00:06:46.060> was<00:06:46.210> asking<00:06:46.389> is<00:06:46.900> how

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:47.260 
other thing somebody was asking is how

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.710 
other thing somebody was asking is how
do<00:06:47.320> you<00:06:47.800> make<00:06:48.550> it<00:06:48.760> so<00:06:48.940> that<00:06:48.970> when<00:06:49.210> you<00:06:49.360> click<00:06:49.540> on

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:49.720 
do you make it so that when you click on

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.060 
do you make it so that when you click on
something<00:06:49.930> in<00:06:50.200> Photoshop<00:06:50.710> that<00:06:50.950> it

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:51.070 
something in Photoshop that it

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:52.530 
something in Photoshop that it
automatically<00:06:51.580> goes<00:06:51.760> to<00:06:51.820> that<00:06:52.060> layer<00:06:52.240> so<00:06:52.480> if

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:52.540 
automatically goes to that layer so if

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:53.940 
automatically goes to that layer so if
I'm<00:06:52.630> on<00:06:52.780> the<00:06:52.840> top<00:06:52.990> layer<00:06:53.169> right<00:06:53.380> here<00:06:53.620> and<00:06:53.860> I

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:53.950 
I'm on the top layer right here and I
