eventually<00:01:07.920> get<00:01:08.010> these<00:01:08.190> guys<00:01:08.400> trained<00:01:08.820> to

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
eventually get these guys trained to

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.970 
eventually get these guys trained to
present<00:01:09.780> their<00:01:09.960> side<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.230> we<00:01:10.560> can<00:01:10.590> do<00:01:10.770> hand

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:10.980 
present their side so we can do hand

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.670 
present their side so we can do hand
injections<00:01:11.750> also<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.990> present<00:01:13.290> their<00:01:13.440> tails

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
injections also to present their tails

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.320 
injections also to present their tails
so<00:01:13.860> we<00:01:13.950> can<00:01:14.070> do<00:01:14.160> a<00:01:14.190> blood<00:01:14.310> draw<00:01:14.490> from<00:01:14.880> there<00:01:15.060> so

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
so we can do a blood draw from there so

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.130 
so we can do a blood draw from there so
I'll<00:01:15.420> ask<00:01:15.810> them<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.080> stand<00:01:16.260> up<00:01:16.760> they'll<00:01:17.760> get<00:01:17.880> a

I'll ask them to stand up they'll get a

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.630 
I'll ask them to stand up they'll get a
treat<00:01:19.140> for<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.890> way<00:01:20.040> we<00:01:20.220> can<00:01:20.400> get<00:01:20.610> a

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
treat for that this way we can get a

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.300 
treat for that this way we can get a
good<00:01:20.820> look<00:01:20.880> at<00:01:21.180> their<00:01:21.330> whole<00:01:21.540> body<00:01:22.310> their
