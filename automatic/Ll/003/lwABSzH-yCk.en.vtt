00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
got to win a title this year I don't

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.379 
got to win a title this year I don't
think<00:03:38.190> so<00:03:38.280> I<00:03:38.310> think<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.639> reason<00:03:38.849> the<00:03:39.090> pressure

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
think so I think the reason the pressure

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:41.719 
think so I think the reason the pressure
is<00:03:39.629> amped<00:03:40.019> up<00:03:40.139> for<00:03:40.379> LeBron<00:03:40.680> James<00:03:40.949> this<00:03:41.430> is<00:03:41.609> the

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:41.729 
is amped up for LeBron James this is the

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:43.699 
is amped up for LeBron James this is the
first<00:03:42.030> time<00:03:42.359> he's<00:03:42.690> gone<00:03:42.930> into<00:03:43.139> the<00:03:43.290> postseason
