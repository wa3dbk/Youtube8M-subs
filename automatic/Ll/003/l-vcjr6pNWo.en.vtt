everything's normally okay but if

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.680 
everything's normally okay but if
something<00:01:36.830> happens<00:01:36.910> and<00:01:37.910> it's<00:01:38.149> an<00:01:38.209> emergency

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
something happens and it's an emergency

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.330 
something happens and it's an emergency
what<00:01:38.869> do<00:01:38.959> you<00:01:39.020> then<00:01:39.140> have<00:01:39.289> to<00:01:39.380> do<00:01:39.500> okay<00:01:40.039> so<00:01:40.069> we

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
what do you then have to do okay so we

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.029 
what do you then have to do okay so we
had<00:01:40.520> exactly<00:01:40.970> that<00:01:41.330> case<00:01:41.599> dog<00:01:41.959> came<00:01:42.200> in<00:01:42.349> it<00:01:42.890> was

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
had exactly that case dog came in it was

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:45.910 
had exactly that case dog came in it was
hit<00:01:43.190> by<00:01:43.340> a<00:01:43.369> car<00:01:43.640> a<00:01:43.910> couple<00:01:44.209> of<00:01:44.300> streets<00:01:44.479> over<00:01:44.920> in

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
hit by a car a couple of streets over in

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.859 
hit by a car a couple of streets over in
pretty<00:01:46.459> bad<00:01:46.640> shape<00:01:46.700> so<00:01:47.179> we<00:01:47.270> had<00:01:47.360> to<00:01:47.450> stabilize

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
pretty bad shape so we had to stabilize

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.559 
pretty bad shape so we had to stabilize
here<00:01:48.170> first<00:01:48.440> of<00:01:48.560> all<00:01:48.770> and<00:01:49.069> then<00:01:49.479> transport<00:01:50.479> the

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:50.569 
here first of all and then transport the

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:53.650 
here first of all and then transport the
animal<00:01:50.929> to<00:01:51.170> our<00:01:51.349> main<00:01:51.830> hospital<00:01:52.819> facility<00:01:53.390> in

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
animal to our main hospital facility in

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.749 
animal to our main hospital facility in
that<00:01:53.750> situation<00:01:54.530> we<00:01:54.619> had<00:01:54.770> to<00:01:54.890> take<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:55.429> animal

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
that situation we had to take the animal

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.999 
that situation we had to take the animal
in<00:01:56.149> the<00:01:56.239> back<00:01:56.420> of<00:01:56.599> our<00:01:56.690> ambulance<00:01:56.950> so<00:01:57.950> it

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
in the back of our ambulance so it

00:01:58.009 --> 00:01:59.740 
in the back of our ambulance so it
really<00:01:58.190> is<00:01:58.340> like<00:01:58.369> an<00:01:58.580> ambulance<00:01:58.789> but<00:01:59.420> without

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
really is like an ambulance but without

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.240 
really is like an ambulance but without
the<00:01:59.899> lives<00:02:00.110> traffic<00:02:00.830> is<00:02:00.979> the<00:02:01.069> most

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
the lives traffic is the most

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.830 
the lives traffic is the most
frustrating<00:02:01.429> thing<00:02:01.970> because<00:02:02.179> you<00:02:02.300> can't<00:02:02.539> cut

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
frustrating thing because you can't cut

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.050 
frustrating thing because you can't cut
through<00:02:03.110> it<00:02:03.259> so<00:02:04.190> you<00:02:04.819> know

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
through it so you know

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.880 
through it so you know
touchwood<00:02:05.390> has<00:02:05.539> never<00:02:05.750> ever<00:02:06.140> happened<00:02:06.619> but

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
touchwood has never ever happened but

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.919 
touchwood has never ever happened but
you<00:02:07.220> know<00:02:07.250> when<00:02:07.789> we<00:02:08.090> don't<00:02:08.179> have<00:02:08.330> the<00:02:08.569> flashing

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
you know when we don't have the flashing

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:09.460 
you know when we don't have the flashing
blue<00:02:09.020> lights

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
blue lights

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.140 
blue lights

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
well you said they have a lot to contend

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.600 
well you said they have a lot to contend

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
eight months ago and we then had a

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.729 
eight months ago and we then had a
logistical<00:02:39.969> problem<00:02:40.290> because<00:02:41.290> I<00:02:41.409> was<00:02:41.530> driving

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
logistical problem because I was driving

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.800 
logistical problem because I was driving
a<00:02:41.950> smart<00:02:42.220> car<00:02:42.459> so<00:02:42.909> I<00:02:42.939> had<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.239> get<00:02:43.390> something

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
a smart car so I had to get something

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.149 
a smart car so I had to get something
that<00:02:43.989> we<00:02:44.109> could<00:02:44.260> you<00:02:44.560> know<00:02:44.650> it<00:02:44.709> was<00:02:44.799> reliable

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:45.159 
that we could you know it was reliable

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:47.190 
that we could you know it was reliable
and<00:02:45.519> a<00:02:45.609> best<00:02:45.790> base<00:02:46.030> we<00:02:46.299> can<00:02:46.450> move<00:02:46.599> move<00:02:47.019> animals

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
and a best base we can move move animals

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.530 
and a best base we can move move animals
easily<00:02:48.099> between<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.489> two<00:02:48.640> hospitals<00:02:49.150> it's

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
easily between the two hospitals it's

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.629 
easily between the two hospitals it's
got<00:02:49.659> enough<00:02:49.810> room<00:02:50.019> for<00:02:50.049> me<00:02:50.349> to<00:02:50.470> put<00:02:50.650> the

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:51.639 
got enough room for me to put the

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.369 
got enough room for me to put the
animals<00:02:52.000> I<00:02:52.180> need<00:02:52.359> in<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.629> back<00:02:52.840> there's<00:02:53.260> also

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
animals I need in the back there's also

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:55.470 
animals I need in the back there's also
enough<00:02:53.650> room<00:02:53.889> for<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.310> equipment<00:02:54.730> we<00:02:55.000> need<00:02:55.269> I

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
enough room for the equipment we need I

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.300 
enough room for the equipment we need I
guess<00:02:56.109> we<00:02:56.200> have<00:02:56.319> any<00:02:56.439> problems<00:02:56.859> on<00:02:56.950> the<00:02:57.069> roads

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
guess we have any problems on the roads

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.940 
guess we have any problems on the roads
it's<00:02:58.239> quite<00:02:58.359> law's<00:02:58.659> a<00:02:58.689> tailgate<00:02:59.379> as<00:02:59.500> well<00:02:59.650> so

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
it's quite law's a tailgate as well so

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.500 
it's quite law's a tailgate as well so
it's<00:03:00.069> quite<00:03:00.220> easy<00:03:00.370> for<00:03:00.549> us<00:03:00.760> to<00:03:00.909> lift<00:03:01.060> animals

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
it's quite easy for us to lift animals

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.449 
it's quite easy for us to lift animals
in<00:03:01.720> and<00:03:01.870> out<00:03:01.989> it's<00:03:02.349> just<00:03:02.500> been<00:03:02.650> reliable<00:03:03.220> what

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
in and out it's just been reliable what

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:04.500 
in and out it's just been reliable what
don't<00:03:03.639> you<00:03:03.700> like<00:03:03.760> so<00:03:04.000> much<00:03:04.180> yeah<00:03:04.389> it's

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
probably not got the number of

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.559 
probably not got the number of
attachment<00:03:06.220> points<00:03:06.579> I<00:03:06.730> would<00:03:06.790> like<00:03:06.939> in<00:03:07.329> order

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
like a lot bigger and I thought if it's

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:25.199 
like a lot bigger and I thought if it's
going<00:03:21.790> to<00:03:21.879> handle<00:03:22.120> like<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:23.439> old<00:03:24.250> Subaru<00:03:24.579> you

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
going to handle like the old Subaru you

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:26.640 
going to handle like the old Subaru you
know<00:03:25.329> how<00:03:25.480> is<00:03:25.540> this<00:03:25.629> going<00:03:25.900> to<00:03:26.019> drive<00:03:26.260> you'd

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
know how is this going to drive you'd

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.319 
know how is this going to drive you'd
imagine<00:03:27.069> going<00:03:27.250> over<00:03:27.459> lots<00:03:27.669> of<00:03:27.760> bumps<00:03:28.120> it's

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
imagine going over lots of bumps it's

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.569 
imagine going over lots of bumps it's
quite<00:03:28.659> it's<00:03:29.260> quite<00:03:29.349> good<00:03:29.560> but<00:03:30.010> like<00:03:30.430> when

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
quite it's quite good but like when

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:31.740 
quite it's quite good but like when
you're<00:03:30.699> driving<00:03:31.030> on<00:03:31.060> roads<00:03:31.299> and<00:03:31.599> you're

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
you're driving on roads and you're

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.050 
you're driving on roads and you're
cornering<00:03:32.260> around<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.739> city<00:03:32.979> you<00:03:33.280> do<00:03:33.849> feel

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
cornering around the city you do feel

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.399 
cornering around the city you do feel
like<00:03:34.269> you're<00:03:34.569> in<00:03:34.720> something<00:03:35.049> like<00:03:35.139> kind<00:03:35.379> of

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:35.409 
like you're in something like kind of

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:37.020 
like you're in something like kind of
supertanker<00:03:36.159> so<00:03:36.459> it's<00:03:36.639> kind<00:03:36.760> of<00:03:36.819> a<00:03:36.909> little

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
supertanker so it's kind of a little

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.849 
supertanker so it's kind of a little
concerned<00:03:37.569> as<00:03:37.720> to<00:03:37.840> something<00:03:38.049> this<00:03:38.620> much

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
concerned as to something this much

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:43.050 
concerned as to something this much
bigger<00:03:39.370> would<00:03:39.849> feel<00:03:41.310> but<00:03:42.310> it's<00:03:42.459> way<00:03:42.579> better<00:03:42.790> I

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
bigger would feel but it's way better I

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.449 
bigger would feel but it's way better I
mean<00:03:43.329> it<00:03:43.419> handles<00:03:43.780> great<00:03:44.310> you<00:03:45.310> know<00:03:45.430> that

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
mean it handles great you know that

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.520 
mean it handles great you know that
everything<00:03:46.090> is<00:03:46.239> just<00:03:46.629> more<00:03:46.840> comfortable<00:03:47.109> and

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
everything is just more comfortable and

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.490 
everything is just more comfortable and
smooth<00:03:47.859> and<00:03:48.849> it<00:03:49.090> actually<00:03:49.329> handles<00:03:49.840> much<00:03:50.260> more

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
smooth and it actually handles much more

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.289 
smooth and it actually handles much more
like<00:03:50.680> a<00:03:50.709> smaller<00:03:51.069> cars<00:03:51.400> but<00:03:51.760> it's<00:03:51.879> pretty<00:03:52.030> fast

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
like a smaller cars but it's pretty fast

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:53.069 
like a smaller cars but it's pretty fast
off<00:03:52.540> the<00:03:52.569> mark

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
off the mark

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.580 
off the mark
the<00:03:53.650> visibility<00:03:54.280> all<00:03:54.430> around<00:03:54.760> is<00:03:55.060> great<00:03:55.590> and

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
the visibility all around is great and

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.649 
the visibility all around is great and
the<00:03:57.250> reverse<00:03:57.639> you<00:03:57.909> know<00:03:58.000> the<00:03:58.120> camera<00:03:58.479> for

00:03:58.649 --> 00:03:58.659 
the reverse you know the camera for

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:00.899 
the reverse you know the camera for
reversing<00:03:59.260> I've<00:03:59.680> never<00:03:59.979> used<00:04:00.280> the<00:04:00.549> reverse

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:00.909 
reversing I've never used the reverse

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:02.939 
reversing I've never used the reverse
parking<00:04:01.389> camera<00:04:01.599> before<00:04:02.109> that<00:04:02.560> was<00:04:02.650> great

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:02.949 
parking camera before that was great

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:04.979 
parking camera before that was great
this<00:04:03.400> space<00:04:03.669> inside<00:04:04.060> is<00:04:04.269> pretty<00:04:04.479> cool<00:04:04.720> as<00:04:04.840> well

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
this space inside is pretty cool as well

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.219 
this space inside is pretty cool as well
and<00:04:05.319> just<00:04:06.280> little<00:04:06.849> things<00:04:07.060> like<00:04:07.419> you<00:04:07.750> just

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:08.229 
and just little things like you just

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:09.839 
and just little things like you just
flick<00:04:08.439> a<00:04:08.470> switch<00:04:08.560> now<00:04:08.979> in<00:04:09.040> a<00:04:09.189> back<00:04:09.340> seat<00:04:09.549> spot

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
flick a switch now in a back seat spot

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.399 
flick a switch now in a back seat spot
down<00:04:10.090> or<00:04:10.389> if<00:04:10.540> you're<00:04:10.689> in<00:04:10.750> a<00:04:10.810> hurry<00:04:10.959> to<00:04:11.290> get

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
things rearranged that that makes a

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.550 
things rearranged that that makes a
difference<00:04:13.419> to<00:04:13.569> me<00:04:13.599> and<00:04:13.870> there's<00:04:14.199> a<00:04:14.260> whole<00:04:14.409> lot

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
difference to me and there's a whole lot

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.379 
difference to me and there's a whole lot
more<00:04:14.769> fixing<00:04:15.220> points<00:04:15.579> in<00:04:15.729> the<00:04:15.790> back<00:04:15.970> there<00:04:16.269> as

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
more fixing points in the back there as

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.240 
more fixing points in the back there as
well<00:04:16.599> and<00:04:17.019> what<00:04:17.500> were<00:04:17.560> your<00:04:17.650> favorite<00:04:18.070> things

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
well and what were your favorite things

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.560 
well and what were your favorite things
about<00:04:18.310> it<00:04:18.609> we<00:04:18.820> would<00:04:18.970> have<00:04:19.000> gone<00:04:19.209> through<00:04:19.479> a

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
about it we would have gone through a

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.120 
about it we would have gone through a
tank<00:04:19.870> in<00:04:20.049> the<00:04:20.139> miles<00:04:20.320> that<00:04:20.500> I've<00:04:20.680> done<00:04:20.829> in<00:04:20.979> this

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
tank in the miles that I've done in this

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.670 
tank in the miles that I've done in this
car<00:04:21.430> in<00:04:21.669> the<00:04:21.940> last<00:04:22.150> week<00:04:22.360> and<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:23.199> old<00:04:23.380> Subaru

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
car in the last week and the old Subaru

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.529 
car in the last week and the old Subaru
in<00:04:24.009> the<00:04:24.130> new<00:04:24.310> one<00:04:24.490> I<00:04:24.729> would<00:04:25.150> say<00:04:25.180> we've

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
in the new one I would say we've

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:26.560 
in the new one I would say we've
probably<00:04:25.780> done<00:04:26.020> a<00:04:26.080> third

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
probably done a third

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.960 
probably done a third
a<00:04:26.600> tank<00:04:26.900> of<00:04:27.080> gas<00:04:27.110> so<00:04:27.860> that's<00:04:28.250> a<00:04:28.430> really<00:04:28.700> big

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
a tank of gas so that's a really big

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.510 
a tank of gas so that's a really big
improvement<00:04:29.330> and<00:04:29.720> just<00:04:30.230> this<00:04:30.560> base<00:04:30.770> is<00:04:31.190> just

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
improvement and just this base is just

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.130 
improvement and just this base is just
easier<00:04:31.790> to<00:04:31.820> work<00:04:32.000> in<00:04:32.060> and<00:04:32.510> what<00:04:32.720> is<00:04:32.990> there

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
easier to work in and what is there

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.540 
easier to work in and what is there
anything<00:04:33.290> that<00:04:33.410> annoys<00:04:33.800> you<00:04:34.040> about<00:04:34.070> it<00:04:34.430> during

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
anything that annoys you about it during

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.980 
anything that annoys you about it during
the<00:04:34.670> week<00:04:34.820> compared<00:04:35.420> to<00:04:35.570> the<00:04:35.660> old<00:04:35.810> one

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
the week compared to the old one

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.140 
the week compared to the old one
honestly<00:04:36.590> I<00:04:36.710> know<00:04:37.160> there<00:04:37.520> isn't<00:04:37.670> a<00:04:37.820> whole<00:04:38.000> lot

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
honestly I know there isn't a whole lot

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.300 
honestly I know there isn't a whole lot
I<00:04:38.180> don't<00:04:38.300> like<00:04:38.600> about<00:04:38.900> it<00:04:39.050> it's<00:04:39.380> a<00:04:39.560> massive

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
I don't like about it it's a massive

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.460 
I don't like about it it's a massive
step<00:04:40.550> forward<00:04:40.610> well<00:04:41.420> there<00:04:41.780> you<00:04:41.900> have<00:04:41.930> it<00:04:42.080> dr.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
step forward well there you have it dr.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.440 
step forward well there you have it dr.
Davis<00:04:42.710> certainly<00:04:42.980> found<00:04:43.220> he's<00:04:43.610> older<00:04:44.090> forests

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
Davis certainly found he's older forests

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.780 
Davis certainly found he's older forests
are<00:04:44.630> very<00:04:44.840> reliable<00:04:45.530> and<00:04:45.710> the<00:04:46.250> new<00:04:46.430> one<00:04:46.640> has

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
are very reliable and the new one has

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.430 
are very reliable and the new one has
certainly<00:04:47.090> made<00:04:47.330> a<00:04:47.600> lasting<00:04:47.990> impression<00:04:48.050> I

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
certainly made a lasting impression I

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.350 
certainly made a lasting impression I
think<00:04:48.470> thanks<00:04:49.370> dr.<00:04:49.640> day<00:04:49.730> for<00:04:49.880> being<00:04:49.970> a<00:04:50.120> part<00:04:50.300> of

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
think thanks dr. day for being a part of

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.480 
think thanks dr. day for being a part of
it
