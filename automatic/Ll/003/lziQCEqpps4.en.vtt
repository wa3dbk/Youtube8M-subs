the<00:00:17.550> way<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.850> zone<00:00:18.090> works<00:00:18.449> is<00:00:18.750> when<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.439> ball

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
the way the zone works is when the ball

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.220 
the way the zone works is when the ball
is<00:00:19.619> in<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.890> middle<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.430> plate<00:00:20.699> or<00:00:21.230> down

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
that diagonal the ball is going to be

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.660 
that diagonal the ball is going to be
whatever<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.689> radar<00:00:27.960> gun<00:00:28.080> says<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.470> is

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
whatever the radar gun says it is

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.310 
whatever the radar gun says it is
assumed<00:00:29.670> however<00:00:30.390> as<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.869> ball<00:00:31.050> starts

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
assumed however as the ball starts

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.000 
assumed however as the ball starts
moving<00:00:31.380> in<00:00:32.210> towards<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.300> hitter<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:34.469> forces

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
moving in towards the hitter it forces

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.760 
moving in towards the hitter it forces
him<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.190> have<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.610> react<00:00:35.910> sooner<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.649> hit<00:00:37.649> the

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
him to have to react sooner and hit the

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.830 
him to have to react sooner and hit the
ball<00:00:37.920> further<00:00:38.190> out<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.579> front<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.329> in<00:00:39.480> essence

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
ball further out in front so in essence

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.080 
ball further out in front so in essence
the<00:00:40.170> ball<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.500> gaining<00:00:40.829> speed<00:00:41.100> it's<00:00:42.000> not

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
the ball is gaining speed it's not

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.389 
the ball is gaining speed it's not
really<00:00:42.480> but<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:43.110> in<00:00:43.410> essence<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.129> hitter

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
really but it in essence to the hitter

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.170 
really but it in essence to the hitter
it<00:00:45.180> might<00:00:45.420> as<00:00:45.539> well<00:00:45.570> be<00:00:46.309> so<00:00:47.309> every<00:00:47.940> pitch

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
it might as well be so every pitch

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.639 
it might as well be so every pitch
that's<00:00:48.450> thrown<00:00:48.750> on<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.170> side<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.559> that

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
that's thrown on this side of that

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.490 
that's thrown on this side of that
diagonal<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.460> gaining<00:00:50.850> speed<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:52.020> closer<00:00:52.289> it

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
diagonal is gaining speed the closer it

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.130 
diagonal is gaining speed the closer it
gets<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.920> hitter<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.510> more<00:00:54.510> dramatically

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
gets to the hitter the more dramatically

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.959 
gets to the hitter the more dramatically
it's<00:00:55.379> gaining<00:00:55.620> speed<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.399> same<00:00:56.610> thing<00:00:56.850> is

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
it's gaining speed and the same thing is

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.880 
it's gaining speed and the same thing is
true<00:00:57.149> on<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.390> other<00:00:57.539> side<00:00:57.809> only<00:00:58.500> it's<00:00:58.649> losing

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
true on the other side only it's losing

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.180 
true on the other side only it's losing
speed<00:01:00.289> let's<00:01:01.289> take<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.469> look<00:01:01.710> at<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.920> from<00:01:02.039> the

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
speed let's take a look at it from the

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.950 
speed let's take a look at it from the
side<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:03.270> will<00:01:03.390> give<00:01:03.510> us<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.690> better<00:01:03.840> idea

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
side and this will give us a better idea

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.080 
side and this will give us a better idea
as<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.710> as<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.250> exactly<00:01:05.360> how<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.420> measure<00:01:06.659> this

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
as to as to exactly how to measure this

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.440 
as to as to exactly how to measure this
the<00:01:09.090> line<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.630> see<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.350> pitch<00:01:10.560> line

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
the line that you see is the pitch line

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.210 
the line that you see is the pitch line
when<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.540> see<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.900> barrel<00:01:13.320> cross<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.920> pitch

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
when you see the barrel cross that pitch

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.679 
when you see the barrel cross that pitch
line<00:01:14.490> that's<00:01:15.210> when<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.600> hitter<00:01:17.479> perceives<00:01:18.479> to

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
line that's when the hitter perceives to

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.210 
line that's when the hitter perceives to
be<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.840> hundred<00:01:19.110> percent<00:01:19.290> on<00:01:19.560> time<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.070> that

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
be a hundred percent on time to that

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.700 
be a hundred percent on time to that
pitch<00:01:20.490> but<00:01:21.390> we<00:01:21.540> can<00:01:21.720> look<00:01:21.900> back<00:01:21.930> here<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.530> see

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
pitch but we can look back here and see

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.580 
pitch but we can look back here and see
where<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.979> ball<00:01:23.130> actually<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:23.850> at<00:01:24.060> and

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
where the ball actually is at and

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:32.120 
where the ball actually is at and
realize<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:26.159> he<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.400> just<00:01:26.850> about<00:01:30.860> 10<00:01:31.860> miles

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
realize that he is just about 10 miles

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.580 
realize that he is just about 10 miles
an<00:01:32.369> hour<00:01:32.490> late<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:35.930> if<00:01:36.930> we<00:01:37.079> were<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.259> look<00:01:37.470> at

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
an hour late so if we were to look at

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.270 
an hour late so if we were to look at
this<00:01:37.829> from<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.490> perspective<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:39.950> this<00:01:40.950> being

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
this from the perspective of this being

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.710 
this from the perspective of this being
a<00:01:41.369> batting<00:01:42.090> tee<00:01:43.880> that's<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.090> place<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.570> he

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
a batting tee that's the place that he

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.990 
a batting tee that's the place that he
would<00:01:45.840> have<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.170> make<00:01:46.200> 100%<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.280> time<00:01:47.490> contact

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
would have to make 100% on time contact

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.880 
would have to make 100% on time contact
if<00:01:48.210> we<00:01:48.630> backed<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.960> barrel<00:01:49.320> up<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.530> little<00:01:49.680> bit

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
if we backed the barrel up a little bit

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.510 
if we backed the barrel up a little bit
and<00:01:51.170> the<00:01:52.170> ball<00:01:52.350> were<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.740> little<00:01:53.040> more<00:01:53.189> towards

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
and the ball were a little more towards

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.580 
and the ball were a little more towards
the<00:01:53.670> middle<00:01:53.700> part<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.509> strike<00:01:54.750> zone<00:01:54.780> then

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
the middle part of the strike zone then

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.399 
the middle part of the strike zone then
he<00:01:56.009> would<00:01:56.369> have<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.610> make<00:01:56.759> contact<00:01:57.240> here<00:01:57.509> if<00:01:57.960> we

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
he would have to make contact here if we

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.959 
he would have to make contact here if we
back<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.770> up<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.950> little<00:01:59.070> bit<00:01:59.280> more<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.759> the

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
back it up a little bit more and the

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.130 
back it up a little bit more and the
pitch<00:02:00.149> were<00:02:00.299> on<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.509> outside<00:02:00.810> part<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.079> the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
pitch were on the outside part of the
