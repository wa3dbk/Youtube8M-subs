00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:09.950
 this video explains how it should be 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.809
 convert a file from rgb acm yk to 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.530
 so as to guarantee the best homogeneity 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.760
 color possible during printing 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.200
 this tutorial is essentially about 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.000
 in photoshop 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.800
 the creative suite program in which 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.910
 color profile management is more 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.860
 gentle 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.930
 in short a photoshop document can 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.060
 exist only in a color method 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.850
 at a time it can be coded to 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.469
 example in rigid or in cm yk but a 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.600
 unlike what happens for example 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.329
 in indesign cannot contain elements 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.070
 of both color methods even if 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.570
 advanced objects available in the 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.010
 program work around in some way 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.750
 this characteristic 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.789
 there are essentially two ways to 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.449
 prepare images for printing in 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.789
 photoshop 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:53.339
 the first outlines a workflow 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.899
 focused on rgb the color method in 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:57.510
 which most of the images 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.789
 photographic today are coded the 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.350
 second point instead directly on cm 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.119
 yk 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.030
 both have advantages and disadvantages 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:08.369
 which is worth discussing 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.170
 in a linked workflow rgb le 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.940
 images are not converted and 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.460
 enter for example in indesign 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.310
 in this color space even if theirs 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.830
 final destination is printing in cm y 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.960
 k the conversion normally occurs 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.479
 carried out at the time of making the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.840
 pdf and is therefore a responsibility of the 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.060
 program 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.130
 in case you provide us with a pdf not 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.200
 we will convert 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.840
 this system is generally safe 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.090
 except for one particular some 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.179
 colors available in gb areas are not 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.520
 reproducible in cm ipson k because in 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:44.530
 technical jargon fall out of the gamut 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.530
 of the space used for printing in 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.450
 four-color process 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.310
 the gamut is the set of all colors 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.950
 which are reproducible in a certain 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.799
 space ecm ipson ka of the notes 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.750
 weaknesses in some areas its most areas 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.729
 the blues and greens are very critical 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.590
 bright and intense and pastel colors 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.600
 very tenuous 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.219
 in these chromatic areas they can be 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.679
 verified discrepancies also 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.750
 significant that sometimes involve 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:11.220
 not only the color but even the 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.650
 detail and shape of objects 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.560
 saturated 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.670
 no automatic process today is in 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.709
 able to manage in a manner 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.220
 satisfactory issues of this 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.620
 gender 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.900
 6 the need to keep under control 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.939
 this potential problem is the only one 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.879
 street is the one that you convert yours 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:31.640
 images in cm yk before importing them 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:34.780
 in indesign then following the second 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.700
 workflow we have mentioned 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.760
 the simplest and most direct method for 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.040
 convert a rgb image into cm yk in 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.260
 photoshop is the one offered by the menu

 image method color cm yk 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.459
 this method works with a warning 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.920
 this operation is very important 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.689
 uses as destination space 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.000
 the one defined in the settings 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:59.760
 color and photoshop we have 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.980
 discussed in a special tutorial if the 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.810
 settings are not the correct ones 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.120

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.090
 in the edit menu, convert to profile and 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.640
 in the dialog that opens 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.709
 you can decide in which color method 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.120
 convert your image and with which 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.120

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.609

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.290
 this procedure guarantees you that the 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.950
 file will be converted in the most manner 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.050
 appropriate 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.090
 an important note is always 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.970
 advisable to keep a copy of the 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.890
 original document in rgb because like 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.660
 we said some colors could 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.670
 don't survive the 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.440
 conversion and in general 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.480
 some adjustment levels if 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.450
 present in the document do not survive 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.729
 therefore it is better to work on 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.639
 a duplicate of the original document e 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:25.220
 keep two distinct versions of an rgb 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.440
 one cm y k 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.540
 in the alternative it is very important that al 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.400
 moment of saving the file yes 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.830
 check that the box is checked 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.220
 incorporates color profile into the window 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.380
 dialog box if the box 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.180
 is not checked the file is saved 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.880
 without an internal reference on the 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.370
 real meaning of the numbers going to 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.660
 to compose his colors 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.450
 this can lead to results 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.330
 literally disastrous in regimes like 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.550
 in cm hickson k save a file without 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.780
 incorporating the profile is a practice for 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.790
 avoid in the most absolute way 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.740
 in this video we talked about how 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.500
 convert a 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.080
 document in photoshop by rgb acm

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.780
 most suitable for printing at
