or your index finger as a post for the
first<00:01:44.729> throw<00:01:45.090> but<00:01:45.810> let's<00:01:46.020> start<00:01:46.289> by<00:01:46.500> using

00:01:46.699 --> 00:01:46.709 
first throw but let's start by using

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:49.699 
first throw but let's start by using
your<00:01:47.069> thumb<00:01:47.459> remember<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.780> goal<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.500> the

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:49.709 
your thumb remember the goal of the

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:52.430 
your thumb remember the goal of the
first<00:01:49.979> throw<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.759> bring<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.179> down<00:01:51.479> flat<00:01:52.080> to

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
first throw is to bring it down flat to

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.669 
first throw is to bring it down flat to
avoid<00:01:53.399> crossing<00:01:53.880> your<00:01:54.330> hands<00:01:54.990> as<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.410> throw

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
avoid crossing your hands as the throw

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.279 
avoid crossing your hands as the throw
is<00:01:55.860> coming<00:01:56.280> down<00:01:56.580> we<00:01:57.390> would<00:01:57.569> suggest<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:58.200> you

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
is coming down we would suggest that you

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.550 
is coming down we would suggest that you
cross<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.310> suture<00:01:59.850> ends<00:02:00.270> before<00:02:00.720> starting

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
cross the suture ends before starting

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.210 
cross the suture ends before starting
so<00:02:02.310> cross<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:03.000> end<00:02:03.209> so<00:02:03.840> your<00:02:04.080> active<00:02:04.649> hand<00:02:04.950> has

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
so cross the end so your active hand has

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.999 
so cross the end so your active hand has
the<00:02:05.250> one<00:02:05.640> on<00:02:05.849> the<00:02:06.000> bottom<00:02:06.229> to<00:02:07.229> get<00:02:07.349> started
