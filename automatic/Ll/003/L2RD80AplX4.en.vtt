00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.200
 in very good situation he wanted to comment 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.610
 and this 1 episode of nuclear mentality 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.660
 and good is a nuclear mentality something 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.160
 different in which I will not try 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.690
 no specific subject simply 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.430
 I'm going to do the typical ones for not only 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.870
 do in the video and what I'm going to do 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.450
 in this recording talk about a little 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.439
 the return already again to retake the channel 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.390
 not by exercise has not come from 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:19.710
 vacation and at night and good this 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.689
 video I'm just going to inform you a 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.829
 little bit of what I'm going to upload what 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.960
 I plan to upload that there are enough 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:26.249
 What's new I've had enough but not 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.169
 look like a being on vacation from 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:31.319
 currelo new people on my part so 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:33.360
 Well, I hope that everything is for the 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:34.410
 channel channel content continue to grow 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.560
 and make it better and better but good 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.060
 we go early to the first break and in 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.650
 this case as well as the one seen in a 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.850
 enemy has given me a good failure 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.110
 enough bullets of the child maybe I 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.790
 could have killed perfectly gives me 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.590
 a bullet does not leave me not even very red 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.700
 but already having an eschera che 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.110
 it has very little cadence and a norm 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.000
 destined more than anything away from me 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.620
 distance and he had a submachine gun here what 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.690
 what do I do that you will see is regular is to say 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.460
 I cover with the column and little by little I 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.079
 I moved backwards until I had 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.910
 a greater advantage not since I have a 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.940
 assault rifle and then on this occasion 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.500
 as it could do no more easily 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.310
 to kill him you will see that they are not over 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.899
 killing copying I think 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.119
 he also leaves so good 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:11.619
 I decide to go elsewhere and from 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.030
 here the game becomes super intense 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.880
 playing as you see with the characters 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.289
 with a quick charger and butt and I 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.729
 I say it 's a nuclear except this one 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.409
 home that is so a bit bland is a 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.210
 very frenetic nuclear a pretty streak 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.340
 high later I think I do not know 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.720
 will count chaves but I will leave it whole and 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.979
 I do not know I liked it a lot because I think it's 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.149
 one of the best moves that has ever 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.590
 been in the series you will see it is 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.509
 pretty good play to the method and well 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.310
 in a room surrounded by enemies and 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.350
 I get away with it, you'll see 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.670
 very cool the truth and good I leave it 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.009
 similar background all the news that 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.000
 I have not in the first place I think the most 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.530
 important and what else are you 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.420
 asking about it that they come out as 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.420
 you know more nominated than I know at least 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.310
 three people from the serious and also 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.200
 forward 09 and good already says it in 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.580
 the only one who could not upload it 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.549
 because I was on vacation out by 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.200
 say it was in Alicante and then there 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.090
 I had a connection I was obviously in 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.979
 a hotel and therefore the connection that the 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.780
 Hotel wifi no if it was 0 with 25 of 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.399
 rise something like that is to say a misery and 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.539
 I could not upload the video so I want to 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.640
 avoid a little better 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:07.659
 talk after the challenge so 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.580
 talk a little about why it is 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.840
 important not the challenge itself not only 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.790
 so the ice cube with the ice 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.700
 vital and that makes a careful reflection 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.019
 and well you know that tomorrow is worth 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.370
 tomorrow is worth only that video that are days 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.629
 so they leave I do not know if I'll put a job 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.129
 background of every two and after the jce 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.079
 so they leave or I will record myself with the 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.879
 camera I do not know but you know that 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:26.469
 do you worry that all the people who are 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.730
 giving the badge even insulting me for 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:29.680
 quality or people who have insulted you for not 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.060
 do it from the bucket you can relax the 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.700
 tits because it's already recorded and that 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.049
 tomorrow I upload it when I can then what 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.030
 next I have to comment you 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.709
 I have a new sponsor with before the week 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.480
 before the husband we are going to make the play 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.010
 here the cucumber play is not going to stop 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.049
 in fried error because if it is not the host 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.790
 getting a c4 is bad with the column and 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.879
 surcharge when the recharge kill the 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.170
 partner here killed another I see here for 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.750
 not always because I say mother of mine 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.220
 is rolling and here what I wanted 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.680
 what you see is that he just killed 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.000
 the one in front of me they were making me down 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.739
 to the left and there was also born a 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.450
 enemy behind on this occasion as already 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.010
 I have said many times in this room has 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.870
 because it has more advantage to the one who is 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.159
 going up through the window because it has 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.419
 to go simply so what I 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:09.159
 I do this time is to throw myself 

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:11.230
 back and also as the sun comes or 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:12.939
 try to kill the enemy that comes by 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.310
 here also he himself knows that he 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:18.630
 I just killed and that surely 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.610
 go for him not the unsuspecting 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.440
 and it's one of the plays I do not know with more 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.330
 tension that the series could have because 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.910
 it's quite complicated to get into a 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.770
 room with three enemies kills all me 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.600
 comes another killed him well and the other two 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.980
 from behind I kill them too and good 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.810
 seen also not what is said by you 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.510
 I have seen that I have not reached 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.070
 shoot in when I've seen the first 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.570
 I just hoped that a 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.460
 little try to position myself better for 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.130
 to be able to shoot we would make another one to 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.590
 a small you see as topped lying down 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.450
 that enemy and here we are looking at 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.470
 two other people and here is the most or 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.120
 less what I have done before playing a 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.500
 little with the column this is very 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.420
 important because I already emphasize it many 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.440
 times apart from doing the initial giec is 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.820
 very important that they take advantage of 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.470
 map elements for example this 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.610
 kitchen column then what 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.920
 I do is mérimée towards the left 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.480
 to have an angle to kill the one who is 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.240
 on the part of the money in the safe 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.130
 and that video that killed him because he canceled in 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.050
 the recharge as you are watching and killed the 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.490
 that came from a little clueless by 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.660
 the other part not then it's very 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.280
 important that they always take advantage of 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.600
 map coverages so let's go to 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.700
 win where fast of news like 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.840
 I said I have a new sponsor and then I do not 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.160
 I can say a lot for the moment on Saturday 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.049
 you will already have all the information about 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.430
 new sponsor will please you 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.180
 because it will improve the quality of 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.400
 videos 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.050
 of the channel and I will also be able to do 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.220
 streaming do not know if next week 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.729
 but I will be able to stream 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.220
 finally with this already with this new thing 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.360
 that they are going to give me because the truth is that 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.650
 I will have many tests for the 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.780
 streaming and it's going to be all more fluid 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.330
 then also tell you that I bought the 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.460
 25 broth for pc was on offer in 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.660
 this site was worth two and a half euros and 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.639
 well then decided to buy melo for 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.960
 able to play custom asia are granted already 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.910
 be with synapses I do not know if you also think 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.470
 I know what I'm buying now and I'm going to upload 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.080
 zombies I will not go up every week 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:58.259
 combi much less but it will be a 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.910
 Sometimes, if I see a map, I like the 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:01.860
 cautious and five of custo more of these than 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.759
 are maps that people do because it 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.050
 security that having been a type of 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:05.610
 problem with no access as it came with 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.840
 more people to make it fun not like that 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.449
 giving a little more variety to the channel 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.190
 also tell you that I'm thinking good 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:13.860
 we are thinking so much poker infer yes 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.449
 as before and I do a series of the call 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.669
 of duty online Chinese zombie mode 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:19.650
 cyborg zombies those are not there then 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:21.270
 I do not know if this week surely not but 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.759
 Next week, you will surely have 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.009
 that miniseries that we will go through 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:26.580
 all the zombie maps surely 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:27.780
 let's try to stop it in all 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.010
 difficulties of the game we have not yet 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.670
 talked too much but you know that 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.560
 there is something in the air 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:35.040
 and that surely I do not know if this week or 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.720
 the next one can go up it's worth but 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.770
 also tell you that this week green 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.420
 was going to surely start well 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.410
 competitive requests with tolete in 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.240
 this case that is a friend of mine who 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.890
 I've known for a long time and that 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.080
 it is in ping and in italy it is new 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.580
 Peric and well you can have a dual 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.870
 in competitive with him very interesting the 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.220
 cat alonso the most competitive 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.870
 deeply and that you will like it a lot 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.070
 which you have competitive channel and 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.390
 well we also say finally that the 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.060
 series of traffics would go back from 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.680
 normal vocal way 24 this Friday and
