00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:59.540 
what's going on here yeah I got a green
or<00:00:47.789> blue<00:00:53.570> Diego<00:00:54.570> one<00:00:56.930> alright<00:00:58.070> so<00:00:59.070> here<00:00:59.250> we<00:00:59.370> are

oh<00:00:59.760> let's<00:01:00.629> quit<00:01:01.160> yeah<00:01:02.160> let's<00:01:02.430> just<00:01:02.579> put<00:01:02.789> them

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
oh let's quit yeah let's just put them

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:11.450 
oh let's quit yeah let's just put them
in<00:01:06.650> the<00:01:07.650> outside<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.100> good<00:01:09.619> I<00:01:10.619> think<00:01:11.310> that's

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
in the outside is good I think that's

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.969 
in the outside is good I think that's
because<00:01:11.810> somebody's<00:01:12.810> somebody's<00:01:13.380> exploded

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
because somebody's somebody's exploded

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.320 
because somebody's somebody's exploded
so<00:01:14.159> it's<00:01:14.310> like<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.580> have<00:01:14.700> some<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.000> size<00:01:15.180> on

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
so it's like you have some in size on

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.359 
so it's like you have some in size on
the<00:01:15.420> outside<00:01:15.720> but<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.799> outside<00:01:17.040> want<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.250> get

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
the outside but the outside want to get

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.140 
the outside but the outside want to get
rid<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:19.520> these<00:01:20.520> just<00:01:20.700> tastes<00:01:20.850> like<00:01:20.909> a

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
rid of that these just tastes like a

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.850 
rid of that these just tastes like a
warhead<00:01:21.450> once<00:01:21.659> he<00:01:21.720> goes<00:01:21.840> sour<00:01:22.140> step<00:01:22.350> off<00:01:22.500> we're

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
warhead once he goes sour step off we're

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:23.600 
warhead once he goes sour step off we're
headed<00:01:23.100> out<00:01:23.189> this<00:01:23.340> hour

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
headed out this hour

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.330 
headed out this hour

it's<00:02:11.810> just<00:02:11.900> like<00:02:15.640> ability<00:02:16.640> inside<00:02:17.000> is<00:02:17.120> just

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
it's just like ability inside is just

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.530 
it's just like ability inside is just
there<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.510> make<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:17.780> outside<00:02:17.930> taste<00:02:18.290> better

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.550 

Aaron's<00:02:23.540> limping<00:02:23.900> now<00:02:23.960> he's<00:02:24.110> gonna<00:02:24.230> spit<00:02:24.470> it

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
Aaron's limping now he's gonna spit it

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.720 
Aaron's limping now he's gonna spit it
out<00:02:25.150> um<00:02:26.350> yeah<00:02:27.350> so<00:02:27.590> that<00:02:27.740> was<00:02:27.860> that<00:02:28.010> I'm<00:02:28.430> saying

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
out um yeah so that was that I'm saying

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.970 
out um yeah so that was that I'm saying
though<00:02:30.190> I<00:02:32.020> I<00:02:33.020> like<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.590> outside

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
though I I like the outside

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.980 
though I I like the outside
yeah<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.820> outside<00:02:35.120> is<00:02:35.240> better<00:02:35.450> on<00:02:35.570> the<00:02:35.660> ice<00:02:35.780> it

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
yeah the outside is better on the ice it

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.690 
yeah the outside is better on the ice it
I<00:02:36.110> think<00:02:36.290> these<00:02:36.380> ones<00:02:36.560> are<00:02:36.770> these<00:02:37.250> ones<00:02:37.520> right

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
I think these ones are these ones right

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.940 
I think these ones are these ones right
here<00:02:37.730> are<00:02:37.970> more<00:02:38.120> tolerable<00:02:38.600> than<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.990> first

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
here are more tolerable than the first

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.040 
here are more tolerable than the first
one<00:02:40.160> because<00:02:40.340> it<00:02:41.000> just<00:02:41.090> has<00:02:41.360> less<00:02:41.540> intensity

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
one because it just has less intensity

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.590 
one because it just has less intensity
no<00:02:42.380> but<00:02:42.740> the<00:02:42.860> sourness

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
no but the sourness

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.470 
no but the sourness
doesn't<00:02:44.600> help<00:02:44.780> my<00:02:44.959> or<00:02:45.459> I<00:02:46.459> can't<00:02:46.850> swallow<00:02:47.060> and

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
doesn't help my or I can't swallow and
