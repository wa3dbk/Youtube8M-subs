put<00:02:44.740> your<00:02:44.830> makeup<00:02:45.220> on<00:02:45.370> so<00:02:46.030> um<00:02:46.480> if<00:02:46.780> you<00:02:47.050> you

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
put your makeup on so um if you you

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.140 
put your makeup on so um if you you
normally<00:02:47.770> do<00:02:47.890> a<00:02:47.920> primer<00:02:48.280> I<00:02:48.610> would<00:02:48.940> do<00:02:49.030> the

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
normally do a primer I would do the

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.020 
normally do a primer I would do the
primer<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:49.900> then<00:02:50.260> this<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:50.890> then<00:02:51.490> continue

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
primer and then this and then continue

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.250

forward<00:02:52.300> with<00:02:52.420> your<00:02:52.630> makeup<00:02:52.900> how<00:02:53.200> you

forward with your makeup how you

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.370 
forward with your makeup how you
normally<00:02:53.590> would<00:02:54.100> so<00:02:54.670> I<00:02:55.090> just<00:02:55.690> think<00:02:55.900> it<00:02:56.170> is<00:02:56.350> a

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
normally would so I just think it is a

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.890 
normally would so I just think it is a
really<00:02:56.620> great<00:02:56.830> formula<00:02:57.490> it's<00:02:58.120> really<00:02:58.510> creamy

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
really great formula it's really creamy

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.510 
really great formula it's really creamy
um<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:01.930> doesn't<00:03:02.140> really<00:03:02.530> have<00:03:02.830> a<00:03:02.860> scent<00:03:03.280> which

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
um it doesn't really have a scent which

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.280 
um it doesn't really have a scent which
is<00:03:03.700> nice<00:03:03.940> because<00:03:04.270> you<00:03:04.450> don't<00:03:04.540> really<00:03:04.780> want<00:03:05.140> to

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
is nice because you don't really want to

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.860 
is nice because you don't really want to
like<00:03:05.590> feel<00:03:05.890> like<00:03:06.070> you're<00:03:06.250> putting<00:03:06.700> on<00:03:06.970> a<00:03:07.510> weird
