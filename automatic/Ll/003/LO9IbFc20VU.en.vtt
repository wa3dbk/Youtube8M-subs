00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
video card i do recommend playing at

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.130 
video card i do recommend playing at
720p<00:02:28.819> resolution<00:02:29.030> mill<00:02:29.630> because<00:02:29.840> you'll<00:02:29.989> be

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
720p resolution mill because you'll be

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.630 
720p resolution mill because you'll be
getting<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:30.440> maximum<00:02:30.620> performance<00:02:31.130> out<00:02:31.610> of

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
getting the maximum performance out of

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.540 
getting the maximum performance out of
that<00:02:31.989> really<00:02:32.989> then<00:02:33.680> we<00:02:33.920> don't<00:02:34.040> have<00:02:34.130> a<00:02:34.250> 1080p

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
that really then we don't have a 1080p

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.220 
that really then we don't have a 1080p
monitor<00:02:34.819> but<00:02:35.330> i<00:02:35.450> really<00:02:35.750> recommend<00:02:35.810> playing

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230
