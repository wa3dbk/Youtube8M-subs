cert of certain items out so they'll

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.319 
cert of certain items out so they'll
make<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.309> game<00:00:50.460> look<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.760> little<00:00:50.910> bit<00:00:51.120> better

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
just like PC maybe a little better so

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.729 
just like PC maybe a little better so
that's<00:00:55.649> going<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.890> be<00:00:56.039> good<00:00:57.590> they're<00:00:58.590> also

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739

which<00:01:03.899> will<00:01:04.080> be<00:01:04.229> pretty<00:01:04.589> cool<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.270> fishing<00:01:06.270> so

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
which will be pretty cool and fishing so

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.630 
which will be pretty cool and fishing so
though<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.110> obviously<00:01:07.950> when<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.250> comes<00:01:08.430> to

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
though so obviously when it comes to

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.010

boats<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.030> fishing<00:01:09.060> I'm<00:01:09.659> pretty<00:01:09.869> sure

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
boats and fishing I'm pretty sure

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.429 
boats and fishing I'm pretty sure
they'll<00:01:10.229> be<00:01:10.260> fish<00:01:10.740> like<00:01:11.729> salmon<00:01:13.220> pufferfish

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
they'll be fish like salmon pufferfish

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.320 
they'll be fish like salmon pufferfish
your<00:01:16.439> regular<00:01:16.860> fish<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.580> don't<00:01:17.790> all<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.119> fish

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
your regular fish I don't all the fish

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.649 
your regular fish I don't all the fish
in<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.900> game<00:01:19.080> but<00:01:20.119> that's<00:01:21.119> pretty<00:01:21.330> much<00:01:21.450> that

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
in the game but that's pretty much that

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.200 
in the game but that's pretty much that
they<00:01:24.229> will<00:01:24.409> also<00:01:24.469> be<00:01:24.859> adding<00:01:25.219> in<00:01:25.369> skin<00:01:25.819> to<00:01:26.090> the

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
they will also be adding in skin to the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.840 
they will also be adding in skin to the
game<00:01:26.450> I'm<00:01:27.319> not<00:01:27.619> sure<00:01:27.920> if<00:01:28.249> they<00:01:28.520> were<00:01:28.579> going<00:01:28.819> to

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
game I'm not sure if they were going to

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.870 
game I'm not sure if they were going to
be<00:01:28.969> making<00:01:29.149> a<00:01:29.509> separate<00:01:29.960> app<00:01:30.490> so<00:01:31.490> you<00:01:31.579> can<00:01:31.609> get

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
be making a separate app so you can get

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.499 
be making a separate app so you can get
the<00:01:32.060> skins<00:01:32.329> or<00:01:33.429> they'll<00:01:34.429> be<00:01:34.670> putting<00:01:34.939> this

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
the skins or they'll be putting this

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.990 
the skins or they'll be putting this
little<00:01:35.840> skin<00:01:36.170> feature<00:01:36.500> into<00:01:37.069> the<00:01:37.219> pocket<00:01:37.880> into

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
little skin feature into the pocket into

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.609 
little skin feature into the pocket into
pocket<00:01:38.479> edition<00:01:38.569> which<00:01:38.929> I<00:01:39.020> think<00:01:39.289> they<00:01:39.409> might

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
pocket edition which I think they might

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.130 
pocket edition which I think they might
do<00:01:39.939> but<00:01:40.939> it'd<00:01:41.119> be<00:01:41.270> kind<00:01:41.479> of<00:01:41.539> cool<00:01:41.600> if<00:01:41.780> they<00:01:41.959> made

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
do but it'd be kind of cool if they made

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.080 
do but it'd be kind of cool if they made
a<00:01:42.170> second<00:01:42.679> app<00:01:42.920> or<00:01:43.130> you<00:01:43.189> can<00:01:43.340> customize<00:01:43.849> your

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090

current<00:01:49.369> way<00:01:49.640> to<00:01:49.700> get<00:01:50.179> skins<00:01:50.599> in<00:01:50.869> Pocket

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
current way to get skins in Pocket

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
i don't know i think like it was like

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.839 
i don't know i think like it was like
1.8<00:04:04.690> bado<00:04:05.079> that<00:04:05.470> was<00:04:05.620> the<00:04:05.829> adventure<00:04:06.519> update

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
1.8 bado that was the adventure update

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:09.330 
1.8 bado that was the adventure update
when<00:04:07.030> it<00:04:07.090> comes<00:04:07.209> like<00:04:07.359> the<00:04:07.810> nether<00:04:08.049> dragon<00:04:08.340> the

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
when it comes like the nether dragon the

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.710 
when it comes like the nether dragon the
nether<00:04:09.579> dragon<00:04:09.849> the<00:04:10.510> Enderdragon<00:04:11.579> hunger

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
nether dragon the Enderdragon hunger

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.199 
nether dragon the Enderdragon hunger
sprinting<00:04:13.720> and<00:04:13.989> like<00:04:14.889> survival<00:04:15.579> i<00:04:15.609> think<00:04:15.970> or

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
sprinting and like survival i think or

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.689 
sprinting and like survival i think or
unless<00:04:16.870> survivals<00:04:17.470> originally<00:04:18.039> owes<00:04:18.280> i<00:04:18.519> think

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:18.699 
unless survivals originally owes i think

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:20.039 
unless survivals originally owes i think
it<00:04:18.760> was<00:04:18.820> creative<00:04:19.239> that<00:04:19.449> was<00:04:19.599> what<00:04:19.900> it<00:04:20.019> was

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
it was creative that was what it was

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.659 
it was creative that was what it was
originally<00:04:20.289> then<00:04:21.159> they<00:04:21.280> had<00:04:21.370> all<00:04:21.549> these

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
originally then they had all these

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.719

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
don't think it will be in this update

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.040 
don't think it will be in this update
but<00:04:39.410> i'm<00:04:39.650> pretty<00:04:39.890> sure<00:04:40.190> in<00:04:40.430> like<00:04:40.870> when<00:04:41.870> they

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
but i'm pretty sure in like when they

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.810 
but i'm pretty sure in like when they
fully<00:04:42.500> release<00:04:42.920> it<00:04:43.100> because<00:04:43.280> i'm<00:04:43.400> pretty<00:04:43.610> sure

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
fully release it because i'm pretty sure

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.720 
fully release it because i'm pretty sure
it's<00:04:44.000> still<00:04:44.180> in<00:04:44.300> beta<00:04:44.480> or<00:04:45.290> alpha<00:04:45.890> or<00:04:46.460> whatever

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
it's still in beta or alpha or whatever

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.930 
it's still in beta or alpha or whatever
it<00:04:46.970> i'm<00:04:47.210> pretty<00:04:47.390> yeah<00:04:47.660> beta<00:04:48.160> then<00:04:49.160> I'll<00:04:49.340> once

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
it i'm pretty yeah beta then I'll once

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.790 
it i'm pretty yeah beta then I'll once
it's<00:04:50.150> fully<00:04:50.450> released<00:04:50.870> then<00:04:51.230> I<00:04:51.380> think<00:04:51.620> they'll

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
it's fully released then I think they'll

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.830 
it's fully released then I think they'll
be<00:04:51.920> adding<00:04:52.220> in<00:04:52.340> that<00:04:52.790> nether<00:04:53.270> and<00:04:53.510> the<00:04:53.660> end

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
be adding in that nether and the end

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.590 
be adding in that nether and the end
because<00:04:54.050> another<00:04:54.500> it<00:04:55.370> sort<00:04:55.640> of<00:04:55.700> lags<00:04:55.970> up<00:04:56.240> the

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
because another it sort of lags up the

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.140 
because another it sort of lags up the
game<00:04:56.780> of<00:04:56.960> it<00:04:57.080> when<00:04:57.290> you're<00:04:57.410> on<00:04:57.500> PC<00:04:57.950> because<00:04:58.940> of

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
game of it when you're on PC because of

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.820 
game of it when you're on PC because of
all<00:04:59.240> these<00:04:59.390> new<00:04:59.600> entities<00:05:00.080> in<00:05:00.290> the<00:05:00.320> game<00:05:00.590> and

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
all these new entities in the game and

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.290 
all these new entities in the game and
it's<00:05:00.950> like<00:05:01.040> a<00:05:01.100> whole<00:05:01.280> new<00:05:01.310> dimension<00:05:01.640> it's

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
it's like a whole new dimension it's

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.060 
it's like a whole new dimension it's
like<00:05:02.420> all<00:05:02.540> this<00:05:02.720> other<00:05:02.900> stuff<00:05:03.070> surprisingly

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
like all this other stuff surprisingly

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.980 
like all this other stuff surprisingly
the<00:05:04.310> end<00:05:04.520> does<00:05:04.790> do<00:05:05.060> that<00:05:05.240> and<00:05:05.600> has<00:05:05.840> the

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
the end does do that and has the

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.250 
the end does do that and has the
Enderdragon<00:05:06.710> and<00:05:06.890> all<00:05:07.100> these<00:05:07.250> Endermen<00:05:07.760> and

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
Enderdragon and all these Endermen and

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.100 
Enderdragon and all these Endermen and
you<00:05:09.260> know<00:05:09.380> it's<00:05:09.530> kind<00:05:09.680> of<00:05:09.850> odd<00:05:10.850> I<00:05:11.480> guess<00:05:11.960> you

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
you know it's kind of odd I guess you

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.320 
you know it's kind of odd I guess you
can<00:05:12.230> say<00:05:12.440> how<00:05:12.680> the<00:05:12.740> end<00:05:13.190> doesn't<00:05:13.760> cause<00:05:14.090> as

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
can say how the end doesn't cause as

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:20.790 
can say how the end doesn't cause as
much<00:05:14.710> lag<00:05:15.710> spikes<00:05:16.160> and<00:05:16.430> stuff<00:05:16.760> as<00:05:17.030> another<00:05:19.690> and

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
much lag spikes and stuff as another and

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.030 
much lag spikes and stuff as another and
you<00:05:21.800> know<00:05:21.950> I<00:05:22.330> hopefully<00:05:23.330> they<00:05:24.290> may<00:05:24.470> be<00:05:24.530> adding

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
you know I hopefully they may be adding

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.430 
you know I hopefully they may be adding
in<00:05:25.190> more<00:05:25.220> things<00:05:25.790> that<00:05:26.600> like<00:05:27.580> 0.7<00:05:28.580> point<00:05:28.790> 0

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
in more things that like 0.7 point 0

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.660 
in more things that like 0.7 point 0
like<00:05:30.440> I'd<00:05:31.070> say<00:05:31.550> was<00:05:31.880> like<00:05:32.060> a<00:05:32.270> year<00:05:32.300> ago<00:05:32.690> I<00:05:33.670> think

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:34.670 
like I'd say was like a year ago I think

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.750 
like I'd say was like a year ago I think
like<00:05:35.030> before<00:05:35.450> joepassgaming<00:05:35.900> quit<00:05:36.620> this<00:05:37.580> was

like before joepassgaming quit this was

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.460 
like before joepassgaming quit this was
like<00:05:37.910> right<00:05:37.940> before<00:05:38.300> he<00:05:38.510> quit<00:05:38.750> they<00:05:39.290> added

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
like right before he quit they added

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.290 
like right before he quit they added
chords<00:05:39.950> into<00:05:40.190> the<00:05:40.310> game<00:05:40.490> before<00:05:40.700> they<00:05:40.970> didn't
