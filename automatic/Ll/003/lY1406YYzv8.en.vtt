I<00:02:12.500> suggest<00:02:12.830> dropping<00:02:13.069> the<00:02:13.160> opacity<00:02:13.400> using<00:02:14.030> a

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
I suggest dropping the opacity using a

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.750 
I suggest dropping the opacity using a
slider<00:02:14.360> somewhat<00:02:14.900> around<00:02:15.110> 50%<00:02:15.800> is<00:02:15.890> optimum<00:02:16.340> so

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
slider somewhat around 50% is optimum so

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.979 
slider somewhat around 50% is optimum so
