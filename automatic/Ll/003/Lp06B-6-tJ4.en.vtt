00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.510 
the thing workable right now actually
the<00:05:37.530> thing<00:05:37.710> right<00:05:37.889> here<00:05:37.919> i<00:05:38.040> think<00:05:38.220> what<00:05:38.430> is

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
the thing right here i think what is

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.210 
the thing right here i think what is
that<00:05:38.669> they<00:05:39.510> are<00:05:39.540> actually<00:05:39.840> life<00:05:40.680> shards<00:05:41.100> and

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
that they are actually life shards and

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.400 
that they are actually life shards and
you<00:05:41.520> get<00:05:41.639> those<00:05:41.850> from<00:05:42.120> breaking<00:05:42.630> place<00:05:43.110> blocks

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
you get those from breaking place blocks

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:44.990 
you get those from breaking place blocks
that<00:05:43.650> you<00:05:43.830> find<00:05:44.070> you<00:05:44.190> know<00:05:44.310> and<00:05:44.520> it<00:05:44.610> generated

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
that you find you know and it generated

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.110 
that you find you know and it generated
ice<00:05:45.210> block<00:05:45.480> by<00:05:45.720> them<00:05:45.870> and<00:05:46.730> when<00:05:47.730> we<00:05:47.820> go<00:05:47.910> out<00:05:48.000> of

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
ice block by them and when we go out of

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.480 
ice block by them and when we go out of
creative<00:05:48.540> here<00:05:48.889> and<00:05:49.889> you<00:05:50.010> go<00:05:50.100> ahead<00:05:50.190> and<00:05:50.370> you

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
creative here and you go ahead and you

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.490 
creative here and you go ahead and you
break<00:05:50.760> this<00:05:51.030> and<00:05:51.330> how<00:05:52.139> you're<00:05:52.229> going<00:05:52.320> to<00:05:52.410> get

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
break this and how you're going to get

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.100 
break this and how you're going to get
some<00:05:52.620> shards<00:05:53.190> and<00:05:53.510> with<00:05:54.510> those<00:05:54.660> charms<00:05:55.020> you

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
some shards and with those charms you

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.170 
some shards and with those charms you
can<00:05:55.260> go<00:05:55.380> ahead<00:05:55.470> and<00:05:55.590> get<00:05:56.130> your<00:05:56.370> strawberry<00:05:56.880> or

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
can go ahead and get your strawberry or

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.640 
can go ahead and get your strawberry or
whatever<00:05:57.570> flavor<00:05:57.960> you<00:05:58.080> want<00:05:58.370> one<00:05:59.370> sugar<00:05:59.639> a

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
whatever flavor you want one sugar a

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.800 
whatever flavor you want one sugar a
strawberry<00:06:01.650> and<00:06:01.919> the<00:06:02.240> I<00:06:03.240> think<00:06:03.570> it's<00:06:03.660> like

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
strawberry and the I think it's like

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.690 
strawberry and the I think it's like
four<00:06:04.200> it's<00:06:04.560> like<00:06:04.710> three<00:06:04.919> or<00:06:05.010> four<00:06:05.070> shards<00:06:05.580> you

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:05.700 
four it's like three or four shards you

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.909 
four it's like three or four shards you
would<00:06:05.820> need<00:06:05.970> /<00:06:06.270> one<00:06:06.540> and<00:06:06.780> you<00:06:07.560> just<00:06:07.680> put<00:06:07.830> them

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 
would need / one and you just put them

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:08.870 
would need / one and you just put them
in<00:06:07.979> there<00:06:08.070> and<00:06:08.190> they<00:06:08.250> get<00:06:08.400> added<00:06:08.700> to<00:06:08.729> this

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
in there and they get added to this

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.520 
in there and they get added to this
little<00:06:09.090> thinking<00:06:09.479> and<00:06:09.630> use<00:06:10.020> that<00:06:10.050> as<00:06:10.470> your

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
little thinking and use that as your

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:15.370 
little thinking and use that as your
fuel<00:06:11.010> to<00:06:11.729> make<00:06:11.910> the<00:06:12.090> ice<00:06:12.210> cream

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.200 

and<00:06:15.470> boom<00:06:16.160> now<00:06:16.370> you<00:06:16.430> have<00:06:16.550> a<00:06:16.580> strawberry<00:06:16.880> ice

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
and boom now you have a strawberry ice

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.480 
and boom now you have a strawberry ice
cream<00:06:17.240> ball<00:06:17.680> so<00:06:18.680> the<00:06:18.770> machines<00:06:19.070> are<00:06:19.250> fairly

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490 
cream ball so the machines are fairly

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.940 
cream ball so the machines are fairly
simple<00:06:19.970> easy<00:06:20.210> to<00:06:20.330> use<00:06:20.420> and<00:06:20.750> look<00:06:20.990> pretty<00:06:21.710> sweet
