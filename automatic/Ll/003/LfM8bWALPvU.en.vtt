00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.600
 For players and fans of PSV Wesel this game was against second division Fortuna 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.480
 Dusseldorf of course a very special game the game of the year 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.640
 but for one actor the BSV it was a very special always Noller 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.600
 Moment captain and defender Marcel Kirsch will after about one 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.390
 Decade to leave the club for professional reasons, of course, means 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.710
 he was once again a highlight to leave my career and it has 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.199
 Winter dear Mr. Heuser but not me yet 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.730
 played a professional team played clock in the then nine-year-old boy 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.690
 on auto eating in class for itself it must be was very very difficult 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.480
 Coach or player of the second division from Dusseldorf in front of the camera 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.190
 getting that evening was not that easy 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.420
 because it was a strict interview ban why ever the captain of the 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.180
 Thankfully Fortuna should not be so close to the stock market 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.920
 then it's always better if you do more 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.400
 yes, if you can make games as to our forest wild and and running 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.260
 on the northern side to server who trains twice a day also this year 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.480
 long on special cases measure is that 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.300
 one has seen that today that he still a bit the liveliness 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.110
 percent 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.730
 drives on the 1006 or spectators in the Auestadion saw one over wide 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.290
 Stretch open play between national and second division 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.870
 and until the 27th minute it was 14 o'clock one-by-zero for the guests 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.460
 Dusseldorf by a goal from u21 national player Maximilian Beister 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.850
 but then it was after a foul on just that 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.700
 only 21 national players 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.140
 Asllani Lutein year of the free kick by Rösler increased to 2 2 0 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.610
 but even after the goal for 0 2 2 put the TSV was not on came 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.579
 interesting combinations 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:51.190
 and she plays quite well with her 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.800
 if not with the necessary effectiveness in the conclusion shortly before the 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.149
 It was again the Fortuna every interface jetzt 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.970
 Jo was Nowitzki with the three to zero 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.310
 the national league sold despite three goals in the first 45 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.720
 Minutes well the followers of both camps 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:15.520
 was satisfied it is clear that there are a few foods 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.480
 when he's the big hit so I'm not a coincidence maybe that's around 1 4 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.190
 Percent again optimistic but there is no one worried that says it in 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.889
 But order is if it makes sense and leads 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:31.919
 good law against another man arrested 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:35.159
 that's why it was the first time that a german in the world 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:39.200
 shortly after the restart, it was the team from Wesel who follow suit 

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:40.989
 It was the turn of the match 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.250
 Eisenstein with a lush shot to the crossbar 

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:50.679
 The ball then brought the Fortuna but again for the second time as 

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:53.299
 Lucchini type of einnetzten Som 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.370
 14 0 in the 62 minute game 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.979
 14 minutes later, it was Marco Königs who scored the lead with his goal 

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:05.840
 Score on 2 5 to 0 could expand 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.029
 but the use of the PSV Wesel was still rewarded by the 80 minutes of play 

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:16.489
 and it was the carefreeness of an A-Jugendspieler Spohn's to 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.379
 Honorary goal for to hear 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:20.310
 Melchert Siebels cheat 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.280
 just changed 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.730
 after a counterattack there would just have been on it and that would be inside 1 future 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.649
 bundle from the point of view of the hosts 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:36.089
 a remarkable goal against the second division an experience that the young 

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:38.640
 Young players should not forget so fast 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.499
 for sure 

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:43.849
 made many goals but that was of course absolutely the most beautiful and 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:45.869
 also the most important goal for me 

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:47.659
 yes I am satisfied 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:52.579
 then it was a new addition to Fortuna Dusseldorf the ex-mainzer Grimaldi 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:57.820
 he scored the law for the 1 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.590
 Christian Weber finished with a goal number one minute later 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.300
 seven led to the village 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:09.450
 to the 7 to 1 final score in the friendly match between PSV Wesel and Fortuna 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.260
 Dusseldorf with which both sides could be satisfied length guys 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.729
 have done very well 

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:17.949
 bitter for the Bernese Parma 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:22.349
 only goal scored and silver and there in the apartment to 500 people try 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:23.659
 to play it out Tel 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:26.339
 so as not to be suspected of bridging midfielder and 

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.870
 then 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.870
 eleven without targeted drive Fesser to bring in Tel yes the tower of course 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.180
 Well, that was just the icing on the cake 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.039
 wonderful among all, rather, what a positive start of the mood has 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:38.689
 Fit the weather has been right 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:42.339
 the topic under everything around so far everything wonderful
