 whether or not the people present is not going to be right 

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:13.699
 first were rules and I am very honored to have a 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:17.499
 column on irna official website because I grew up 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:22.109
 he walked out today in those who owned at the time in high school we said 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.710
 the doctor I read very Brazilian of science today that was somehow 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.539
 inspiring me to try to find but these then homemade can or should 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.620
 contribute with with the project sesi is today at sea 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:36.400
 It's a great honor and I do not feel clear to me. 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.700
 it matters first if you are accountable to the society that is 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.900
 new love in a research note where basically everything that takes away cheesemaker 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.340
 public onwards 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.210
 all Brazilians have invested here so first thing is to let me have 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.379
 a bad as a channel a door produce prayer presents itself in this way 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:55.700
 second what? 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.450
 it all these social media giving them has that of social networks anyway 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.670
 blogs and columns 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.489
 has a hand the impact across the network six times 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.130
 has an article that is read in a few hours by a thousand people or by 30 thousand 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.060
 people a very short period of time 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.680
 this in terms of impact that the researcher and teacher had 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.010
 years ago it was very old in the past it was only a little 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.850
 hundred people is a full conference if you write you will have thousand 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.240
 of the 5 thousand ten thousand 30 thousand people - I work being what you think then 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.460
 this is also a very new form of relationship and it has to be very well 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.670
 harnessed by the researchers I will try within the one of the thousand column 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.950
 connections is basically 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.780
 O 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.780
 not specialized what is the routine of profit that is the day to day daily life 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.370
 of a research laboratory buildings track trying to explore 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:55.109
 in a more technical way here but the most playful way and most is a powder 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.780
 inside the wheel column sc that is today the fiems will try to bring issues dodo 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.880
 allow our questions to be answered. 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.530
 so I have as a researcher trying to translate the 80s to transform them 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.060
 in a language that is appealing to everyone
