crankshaft<00:02:26.810> these<00:02:27.810> flywheels<00:02:28.140> are<00:02:28.620> gorgeous

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
crankshaft these flywheels are gorgeous

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.620 
crankshaft these flywheels are gorgeous
I<00:02:29.250> don't<00:02:29.430> know<00:02:29.519> how<00:02:29.670> much<00:02:29.819> they<00:02:30.030> weigh<00:02:30.239> it'd<00:02:30.480> be

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
I don't know how much they weigh it'd be

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.180 
I don't know how much they weigh it'd be
fun<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:30.989> pull<00:02:31.170> them<00:02:31.290> off<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.739> find<00:02:32.010> out

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
fun to pull them off and find out

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.960 
fun to pull them off and find out
exactly<00:02:32.640> how<00:02:32.850> much<00:02:33.030> they<00:02:33.269> weigh<00:02:37.730> if<00:02:38.730> you<00:02:38.819> look

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
exactly how much they weigh if you look

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.240 
exactly how much they weigh if you look
down<00:02:39.150> here<00:02:39.209> you<00:02:39.660> can<00:02:39.780> see<00:02:39.989> our<00:02:40.200> nature<00:02:40.920> spark

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
down here you can see our nature spark

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.030 
down here you can see our nature spark
plug<00:02:41.489> and<00:02:45.080> what<00:02:46.080> this<00:02:46.260> is<00:02:46.470> would<00:02:46.739> be<00:02:46.769> our

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
plug and what this is would be our

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.120 
plug and what this is would be our
ignition<00:02:47.220> kill<00:02:47.760> line<00:02:48.030> right<00:02:48.360> here<00:02:49.130> because

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
ignition kill line right here because

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.430 
ignition kill line right here because
when<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.459> governor<00:02:50.820> latches<00:02:51.329> out<00:02:51.540> it's<00:02:52.260> going

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
when the governor latches out it's going

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.229 
when the governor latches out it's going
to<00:02:52.530> latch<00:02:52.739> out<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.370> it's<00:02:53.519> gonna<00:02:53.640> latch<00:02:53.970> the

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
to latch out and it's gonna latch the

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.840 
to latch out and it's gonna latch the
exhaust<00:02:54.600> valve<00:02:54.900> and<00:02:55.200> hold<00:02:55.410> it<00:02:55.560> open<00:02:55.739> then<00:02:56.670> this

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
exhaust valve and hold it open then this

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.729 
exhaust valve and hold it open then this
is<00:02:57.060> going<00:02:57.239> to<00:02:57.299> kill<00:02:57.540> our<00:02:57.720> ignition<00:02:58.200> so<00:02:58.530> it's<00:02:58.680> a

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
is going to kill our ignition so it's a

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.210 
is going to kill our ignition so it's a
spark<00:02:59.100> saver<00:02:59.400> is<00:02:59.670> what<00:02:59.880> that<00:03:00.090> is<00:03:00.860> and<00:03:01.860> then<00:03:02.070> our

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
spark saver is what that is and then our

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.610 
spark saver is what that is and then our
oiler<00:03:02.579> is<00:03:02.700> going<00:03:02.850> to<00:03:02.910> end<00:03:03.030> up<00:03:03.150> screwing<00:03:03.620> right

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
oiler is going to end up screwing right

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.789 
oiler is going to end up screwing right
there<00:03:05.360> yep<00:03:06.360> there<00:03:06.660> we<00:03:06.750> go<00:03:06.930> that's<00:03:07.410> gonna<00:03:07.560> go

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
there yep there we go that's gonna go

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:08.780 
there yep there we go that's gonna go
right<00:03:08.070> like<00:03:08.280> that

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
right like that

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.960 
right like that
exactly<00:03:09.860> so<00:03:10.860> assembly<00:03:11.370> it<00:03:11.489> looks<00:03:11.640> like<00:03:11.790> it's

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
exactly so assembly it looks like it's

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.940 
exactly so assembly it looks like it's
going<00:03:12.120> to<00:03:12.150> be<00:03:12.269> very<00:03:12.660> very<00:03:13.019> minor<00:03:13.350> we've<00:03:13.769> only

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
going to be very very minor we've only

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.620 
going to be very very minor we've only
got<00:03:14.160> a<00:03:14.190> few<00:03:14.280> things<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:14.820> do<00:03:15.000> look<00:03:15.359> at<00:03:15.480> this

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
got a few things to do look at this

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.210 
got a few things to do look at this
we've<00:03:15.810> got<00:03:15.989> these<00:03:16.140> beautiful<00:03:16.470> little<00:03:16.859> grease

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
we've got these beautiful little grease

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
cups right here and I'm going to assume

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.229 
cups right here and I'm going to assume
that<00:03:21.180> this<00:03:21.359> is<00:03:21.540> going<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:21.900> be<00:03:22.049> our<00:03:22.940> fuel<00:03:23.940> fill

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
that this is going to be our fuel fill

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.130 
that this is going to be our fuel fill
right<00:03:24.660> there<00:03:24.989> and<00:03:25.230> that<00:03:25.799> our<00:03:25.920> fuel<00:03:26.190> filler

right there and that our fuel filler

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.380 
right there and that our fuel filler
goes<00:03:28.140> on<00:03:28.410> like<00:03:28.680> this<00:03:28.920> we'll<00:03:29.910> go<00:03:30.030> ahead<00:03:30.150> and

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
goes on like this we'll go ahead and

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.789 
goes on like this we'll go ahead and
pull<00:03:30.540> that<00:03:30.570> back<00:03:30.989> off<00:03:32.840> and<00:03:33.840> we're<00:03:34.530> gonna<00:03:34.590> have

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799

that's what we've got right there and
then<00:03:48.959> there's<00:03:49.170> our<00:03:49.350> power<00:03:50.130> operated<00:03:50.670> exhaust

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
then there's our power operated exhaust

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.910 
then there's our power operated exhaust
valve<00:03:51.420> like<00:03:51.690> I<00:03:51.840> said<00:03:52.079> here's<00:03:52.440> our<00:03:52.560> governor

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
valve like I said here's our governor

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.100 
valve like I said here's our governor
and<00:03:53.040> our<00:03:53.099> latching<00:03:53.519> mechanism<00:03:53.550> and<00:03:54.239> you<00:03:54.959> can

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
and our latching mechanism and you can

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.160 
and our latching mechanism and you can
see<00:03:55.319> that<00:03:55.500> that's<00:03:55.650> your

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
see that that's your

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.720 
see that that's your
matching<00:03:56.440> pin<00:03:56.680> right<00:03:56.920> there<00:03:57.160> that's<00:03:57.430> going<00:03:57.670> to

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
matching pin right there that's going to

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.940 
matching pin right there that's going to
lock<00:03:58.209> the<00:03:58.540> exhaust<00:03:58.900> valve<00:03:59.230> open<00:03:59.620> when<00:03:59.860> the

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
lock the exhaust valve open when the

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.540 
lock the exhaust valve open when the
governor<00:04:00.480> latches<00:04:01.500> this<00:04:02.500> is<00:04:02.680> beautiful<00:04:03.160> this
