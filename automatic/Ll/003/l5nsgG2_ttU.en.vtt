the game just been going through the
different<00:00:13.880> weapon<00:00:14.150> files<00:00:14.450> looking<00:00:14.870> at<00:00:14.990> stuff

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:15.140 
different weapon files looking at stuff

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.900 
different weapon files looking at stuff
and<00:00:15.260> they've<00:00:15.410> clearly<00:00:15.769> coded<00:00:16.310> and<00:00:16.490> tried

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
and they've clearly coded and tried

and they've clearly coded and tried
tested<00:00:17.540> lots<00:00:18.230> of<00:00:18.439> mods<00:00:18.650> for<00:00:18.890> the<00:00:18.980> different

tested lots of mods for the different

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.580 
tested lots of mods for the different
weapons<00:00:19.520> and<00:00:19.700> yet<00:00:20.210> most<00:00:20.750> of<00:00:20.960> them<00:00:21.140> I<00:00:21.320> think<00:00:21.349> the

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
weapons and yet most of them I think the

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.200 
weapons and yet most of them I think the
majority<00:00:21.710> don't<00:00:22.340> seem<00:00:22.610> to<00:00:22.730> have<00:00:22.820> made<00:00:22.939> it<00:00:23.000> into

majority don't seem to have made it into

majority don't seem to have made it into
the<00:00:23.300> game<00:00:23.450> so<00:00:23.779> I<00:00:23.810> thought<00:00:24.200> I'd<00:00:24.380> cover<00:00:24.590> a<00:00:24.710> few<00:00:24.860> of

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
the game so I thought I'd cover a few of

the game so I thought I'd cover a few of
show<00:00:25.520> you<00:00:25.579> a<00:00:25.669> few<00:00:25.910> of<00:00:25.970> the<00:00:26.119> ideas<00:00:26.480> from<00:00:26.720> the

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
show you a few of the ideas from the

recycle been respawn seems to have taken

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.760 
recycle been respawn seems to have taken
a<00:00:29.540> very<00:00:29.630> different<00:00:30.110> approach<00:00:30.169> when<00:00:30.500> it<00:00:30.560> comes

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
a very different approach when it comes

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.229 
a very different approach when it comes
to<00:00:30.890> adding<00:00:31.160> more<00:00:31.430> stuff<00:00:31.700> to<00:00:31.910> their<00:00:32.060> game

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
to adding more stuff to their game

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.150 
to adding more stuff to their game
compared<00:00:33.020> to<00:00:33.140> a<00:00:33.170> developer<00:00:33.590> like<00:00:33.739> dice

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
compared to a developer like dice

compared to a developer like dice
especially<00:00:34.910> who<00:00:35.030> like<00:00:35.060> step<00:00:35.510> add<00:00:35.720> as<00:00:35.930> many

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
especially who like step add as many

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.660 
especially who like step add as many
things<00:00:36.410> as<00:00:36.590> they<00:00:36.739> can<00:00:36.890> come<00:00:37.010> up<00:00:37.040> with<00:00:37.340> into

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
things as they can come up with into

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.029 
things as they can come up with into

this<00:00:57.980> is<00:00:58.100> a<00:00:58.129> topic<00:00:58.339> for<00:00:58.550> another<00:00:58.699> commentary

this is a topic for another commentary
let's<00:00:59.600> talk<00:00:59.839> about<00:00:59.989> some<00:01:00.230> stuff<00:01:00.379> that<00:01:00.440> didn't

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
let's talk about some stuff that didn't

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.549 
let's talk about some stuff that didn't
make<00:01:01.519> the<00:01:01.579> cut<00:01:01.879> in<00:01:02.120> titanfall<00:01:02.480> I<00:01:02.899> should

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
make the cut in titanfall I should

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:04.660 
make the cut in titanfall I should
caution<00:01:03.769> that<00:01:03.980> a<00:01:04.100> lot<00:01:04.309> of<00:01:04.430> these<00:01:04.519> were

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
caution that a lot of these were

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.220 
caution that a lot of these were
probably<00:01:04.940> made<00:01:05.420> when<00:01:05.659> the<00:01:05.750> game<00:01:05.900> was<00:01:05.930> in<00:01:06.170> a

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:06.230 
probably made when the game was in a

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.350 
probably made when the game was in a
much<00:01:06.500> earlier<00:01:06.710> state<00:01:07.190> and<00:01:07.430> didn't<00:01:07.850> look<00:01:08.060> quite

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
much earlier state and didn't look quite

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.870 
much earlier state and didn't look quite
like<00:01:08.659> it<00:01:08.720> what<00:01:08.990> it<00:01:09.110> does<00:01:09.290> at<00:01:09.590> release<00:01:10.010> and<00:01:10.310> for

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
like it what it does at release and for

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.520 
like it what it does at release and for
this<00:01:11.030> I'll<00:01:11.210> just<00:01:11.570> talk<00:01:11.780> about<00:01:11.930> weapons<00:01:12.380> that

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
this I'll just talk about weapons that

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.160 
this I'll just talk about weapons that
I've<00:01:12.650> already<00:01:12.920> made<00:01:13.280> a<00:01:13.340> video<00:01:13.520> for<00:01:14.000> the<00:01:14.810> archer

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
I've already made a video for the archer

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.510 
I've already made a video for the archer
rocket<00:01:15.530> launcher<00:01:15.800> at<00:01:15.890> one<00:01:16.040> time<00:01:16.220> had<00:01:16.490> a

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
rocket launcher at one time had a

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.370 
rocket launcher at one time had a
laser-guided<00:01:17.060> mod<00:01:17.570> you<00:01:17.780> know<00:01:17.840> the<00:01:18.050> rocket

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
laser-guided mod you know the rocket

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.560 
laser-guided mod you know the rocket
goes<00:01:18.620> where<00:01:18.950> you<00:01:19.100> point<00:01:19.400> the<00:01:19.460> laser<00:01:19.700> much<00:01:20.360> like

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
goes where you point the laser much like

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.350 
goes where you point the laser much like
es<00:01:20.870> raw<00:01:21.050> does<00:01:21.230> in<00:01:21.380> battlefield<00:01:21.830> 4<00:01:22.360> probably

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
es raw does in battlefield 4 probably

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.000 
es raw does in battlefield 4 probably
wouldn't<00:01:23.690> have<00:01:23.810> given<00:01:23.960> the<00:01:24.200> Titan<00:01:24.590> pilot<00:01:24.950> a

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
wouldn't have given the Titan pilot a

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.010 
wouldn't have given the Titan pilot a
heads<00:01:25.190> up<00:01:25.370> that<00:01:25.400> you<00:01:25.550> were<00:01:25.790> targeting<00:01:26.330> him<00:01:26.450> my

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
heads up that you were targeting him my

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.810 
heads up that you were targeting him my
guess<00:01:27.260> why<00:01:27.440> they<00:01:27.590> took<00:01:27.740> it<00:01:27.800> out<00:01:28.010> is<00:01:28.220> because<00:01:28.580> it

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
guess why they took it out is because it

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.520 
guess why they took it out is because it
would<00:01:28.910> let<00:01:29.030> you<00:01:29.150> free<00:01:29.510> fire<00:01:29.750> the<00:01:29.960> rocket<00:01:30.380> and

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
would let you free fire the rocket and

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.960 
would let you free fire the rocket and
therefore<00:01:31.070> it<00:01:31.190> could<00:01:31.280> be<00:01:31.430> used<00:01:31.640> against

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
therefore it could be used against

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.970 
therefore it could be used against
infantry<00:01:32.390> and<00:01:32.810> that<00:01:33.140> might<00:01:33.440> get<00:01:33.710> a<00:01:33.740> little

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:33.980 
infantry and that might get a little

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.670 
infantry and that might get a little
silly<00:01:34.370> and<00:01:34.730> the<00:01:35.210> files<00:01:35.480> also<00:01:35.780> list<00:01:36.110> a<00:01:36.230> Titan

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
silly and the files also list a Titan

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.130 
silly and the files also list a Titan
hammer<00:01:36.860> or<00:01:37.100> big<00:01:37.340> kahuna<00:01:37.820> missile<00:01:38.150> a<00:01:38.330> slow

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
hammer or big kahuna missile a slow

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.900 
hammer or big kahuna missile a slow
moving<00:01:39.170> but<00:01:39.530> heavy<00:01:40.040> hitting<00:01:40.310> I<00:01:40.520> guess<00:01:40.760> that

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
moving but heavy hitting I guess that

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.460 
moving but heavy hitting I guess that
just<00:01:41.000> became<00:01:41.300> the<00:01:41.480> amped<00:01:41.750> version<00:01:42.110> didn't<00:01:42.380> it

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
just became the amped version didn't it

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.590 
just became the amped version didn't it
I<00:01:42.620> need<00:01:43.070> to<00:01:43.190> point<00:01:43.400> out<00:01:43.580> how<00:01:43.940> absolutely

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
I need to point out how absolutely

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.930 
I need to point out how absolutely
hilariously<00:01:45.530> slow-moving<00:01:46.130> this<00:01:46.430> rocket<00:01:46.820> is

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
hilariously slow-moving this rocket is

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.810 
hilariously slow-moving this rocket is
it<00:01:47.660> cracks<00:01:48.470> me<00:01:48.590> up<00:01:48.680> every<00:01:49.010> time<00:01:49.160> I<00:01:49.220> see<00:01:49.520> it<00:01:49.550> and

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
it cracks me up every time I see it and

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.330 
it cracks me up every time I see it and
finally<00:01:50.750> for<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:50.990> archer<00:01:51.260> was<00:01:51.440> a<00:01:51.470> fast<00:01:51.890> lock

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
finally for the archer was a fast lock

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.890 
finally for the archer was a fast lock
mod<00:01:52.700> which<00:01:53.210> I<00:01:53.330> guess<00:01:53.480> would<00:01:53.630> just<00:01:53.780> be<00:01:53.870> a

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
mod which I guess would just be a

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.750 
mod which I guess would just be a
trade-off<00:01:54.200> between<00:01:54.410> lock<00:01:55.010> on<00:01:55.220> time<00:01:55.460> and

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
trade-off between lock on time and

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.450 
trade-off between lock on time and
damage<00:01:56.360> thing<00:01:57.050> is<00:01:57.260> the<00:01:57.440> lock<00:01:57.650> on<00:01:57.830> time<00:01:58.040> isn't

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
damage thing is the lock on time isn't

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.890 
damage thing is the lock on time isn't
that<00:01:58.490> long<00:01:58.790> in<00:01:58.970> the<00:01:59.030> release<00:01:59.300> you<00:01:59.570> get<00:01:59.720> out<00:01:59.810> of

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
that long in the release you get out of

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.200 
that long in the release you get out of
the<00:01:59.960> hole<00:02:00.110> needing<00:02:00.770> to<00:02:00.860> reload<00:02:01.310> giving<00:02:02.030> away

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
the hole needing to reload giving away

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.060 
the hole needing to reload giving away
your<00:02:02.240> position<00:02:02.510> and<00:02:03.050> my<00:02:03.470> guess<00:02:03.530> is<00:02:03.890> they

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
your position and my guess is they

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.590 
your position and my guess is they
figured<00:02:04.460> that<00:02:04.640> while<00:02:05.120> it<00:02:05.240> was<00:02:05.330> going<00:02:05.360> to<00:02:05.510> be

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
figured that while it was going to be

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.390 
figured that while it was going to be
really<00:02:05.900> hard<00:02:06.080> to<00:02:06.140> balance<00:02:06.410> and<00:02:06.770> it<00:02:07.100> wasn't

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
really hard to balance and it wasn't

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.160 
really hard to balance and it wasn't
going<00:02:07.580> to<00:02:07.670> be<00:02:07.760> very<00:02:07.940> unique<00:02:08.420> and<00:02:08.690> so<00:02:08.869> they<00:02:09.019> got

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
going to be very unique and so they got

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.890 
going to be very unique and so they got
rid<00:02:09.319> of<00:02:09.379> it<00:02:09.530> with<00:02:10.489> the<00:02:10.519> XO<00:02:10.940> 16<00:02:11.330> chain<00:02:11.569> gun<00:02:11.750> they

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
rid of it with the XO 16 chain gun they

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.930 
rid of it with the XO 16 chain gun they
were<00:02:11.959> clearly<00:02:12.410> experimenting<00:02:13.340> with<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.640> idea

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
were clearly experimenting with the idea

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.120 
were clearly experimenting with the idea
of<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.300> accelerator<00:02:14.870> my<00:02:15.530> guess<00:02:15.770> is<00:02:15.800> that<00:02:15.950> the

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
of the accelerator my guess is that the

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.490 
of the accelerator my guess is that the
factory<00:02:16.640> issue<00:02:16.790> version<00:02:17.300> had<00:02:17.660> some<00:02:18.080> version

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
factory issue version had some version

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.820 
factory issue version had some version
of

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
of

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.070 
of
at<00:02:19.400> one<00:02:19.550> point<00:02:19.580> in<00:02:20.060> addition<00:02:20.900> to<00:02:20.960> the

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
at one point in addition to the

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.420 
at one point in addition to the
accelerator<00:02:21.620> version<00:02:21.980> that<00:02:22.100> we<00:02:22.220> ought

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
accelerator version that we ought

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.520 
accelerator version that we ought
there's<00:02:22.700> another<00:02:22.970> with<00:02:23.240> an<00:02:23.360> even<00:02:23.720> higher<00:02:24.080> fire

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
there's another with an even higher fire

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.770 
there's another with an even higher fire
rate<00:02:24.830> I'm<00:02:25.460> guessing<00:02:25.970> we<00:02:26.090> wound<00:02:26.300> up<00:02:26.450> with<00:02:26.630> the

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
rate I'm guessing we wound up with the

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.570 
rate I'm guessing we wound up with the
non<00:02:27.020> accelerator<00:02:27.560> version<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:28.070> accelerator

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
non accelerator version and accelerator

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.700 
non accelerator version and accelerator
version<00:02:28.940> as<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:29.090> compromise<00:02:29.630> between<00:02:29.870> all<00:02:30.530> the

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
version as a compromise between all the

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:31.990 
version as a compromise between all the
different<00:02:30.740> things<00:02:31.010> that<00:02:31.250> they<00:02:31.400> tried<00:02:31.730> here

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
different things that they tried here

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.850 
different things that they tried here
and<00:02:32.150> like<00:02:32.780> a<00:02:32.810> lot<00:02:33.020> of<00:02:33.170> these<00:02:33.230> mods<00:02:33.500> that<00:02:33.650> came

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
and like a lot of these mods that came

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.520 
and like a lot of these mods that came
down<00:02:34.010> to<00:02:34.070> being<00:02:34.370> unique<00:02:35.180> and<00:02:35.420> being<00:02:36.020> balanced

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
down to being unique and being balanced

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.590 
down to being unique and being balanced
both<00:02:36.770> from<00:02:37.340> being<00:02:37.550> too<00:02:37.700> good<00:02:37.910> or<00:02:38.090> from<00:02:38.390> being

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
both from being too good or from being

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.380 
both from being too good or from being
too<00:02:38.750> bad<00:02:38.960> there's<00:02:39.860> also<00:02:40.070> a<00:02:40.220> burst<00:02:40.580> fire<00:02:40.880> mod<00:02:41.180> of

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
too bad there's also a burst fire mod of

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.290 
too bad there's also a burst fire mod of
eight<00:02:42.020> rounds<00:02:42.650> it's<00:02:43.130> interesting<00:02:43.730> i'm<00:02:44.150> not

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
eight rounds it's interesting i'm not

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.970 
eight rounds it's interesting i'm not
sure<00:02:44.450> i'd<00:02:44.600> want<00:02:44.630> eight<00:02:45.020> rounds<00:02:45.470> every<00:02:45.620> time<00:02:45.950> i

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
sure i'd want eight rounds every time i

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.680 
sure i'd want eight rounds every time i
want<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:46.370> take<00:02:46.520> on<00:02:46.670> infantry<00:02:47.150> though<00:02:47.480> the

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
want to take on infantry though the

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.290 
want to take on infantry though the
minions<00:02:48.110> do<00:02:48.290> group<00:02:48.860> up<00:02:49.040> it<00:02:49.310> might<00:02:49.490> be<00:02:49.700> okay<00:02:50.060> i

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
minions do group up it might be okay i

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.080 
minions do group up it might be okay i
would<00:02:51.140> expect<00:02:51.380> to<00:02:51.590> be<00:02:51.740> more<00:02:52.040> an<00:02:52.220> anti<00:02:52.670> titan

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
would expect to be more an anti titan

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.270 
would expect to be more an anti titan
thing<00:02:53.450> at<00:02:53.600> that<00:02:53.750> point<00:02:54.020> but<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.710> accelerator

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
thing at that point but the accelerator

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.070 
thing at that point but the accelerator
already<00:02:55.640> serves<00:02:55.910> that<00:02:56.150> role<00:02:56.390> and<00:02:56.570> so<00:02:56.810> we<00:02:56.930> see

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
already serves that role and so we see

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.080 
already serves that role and so we see
again<00:02:57.290> it<00:02:57.920> doesn't<00:02:58.130> really<00:02:58.310> serve<00:02:58.580> a<00:02:58.610> unique

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
again it doesn't really serve a unique

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.970 
again it doesn't really serve a unique
role<00:02:59.360> and<00:02:59.600> so<00:02:59.810> they<00:02:59.990> probably<00:03:00.260> got<00:03:00.620> rid<00:03:00.830> of<00:03:00.860> it

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
role and so they probably got rid of it

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.910 
role and so they probably got rid of it
bit<00:03:01.190> me<00:03:01.490> that's<00:03:01.850> just<00:03:02.060> my<00:03:02.270> guess<00:03:02.300> and<00:03:02.920> finally

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
bit me that's just my guess and finally

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.850 
bit me that's just my guess and finally
a<00:03:03.950> really<00:03:04.580> interesting<00:03:04.910> one<00:03:05.350> electric<00:03:06.350> rounds

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
a really interesting one electric rounds

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.770 
a really interesting one electric rounds
better<00:03:07.340> against<00:03:07.610> shields<00:03:07.970> and<00:03:08.330> the<00:03:08.390> vortex

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
better against shields and the vortex

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.170 
better against shields and the vortex
shields<00:03:09.230> but<00:03:09.470> overall<00:03:09.860> worst<00:03:10.310> DPS<00:03:10.940> and

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
shields but overall worst DPS and

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.270 
shields but overall worst DPS and
there's<00:03:11.959> even<00:03:12.260> a<00:03:12.320> comment<00:03:12.650> in<00:03:12.740> the<00:03:12.830> code<00:03:13.040> that

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
there's even a comment in the code that

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.130 
there's even a comment in the code that
suggests<00:03:13.670> its<00:03:13.820> intended<00:03:14.180> use<00:03:14.360> when<00:03:14.810> you<00:03:14.900> find

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
suggests its intended use when you find

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.140 
suggests its intended use when you find
yourself<00:03:15.230> in<00:03:15.530> a<00:03:15.620> to<00:03:15.830> be<00:03:15.980> tues<00:03:16.190> Titan<00:03:16.640> situation

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
yourself in a to be tues Titan situation

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.060 
yourself in a to be tues Titan situation
you<00:03:17.570> can<00:03:17.750> bring<00:03:18.050> down<00:03:18.260> the<00:03:18.410> shields<00:03:18.740> on<00:03:18.830> one

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
you can bring down the shields on one

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.820 
you can bring down the shields on one
Titan<00:03:19.490> and<00:03:19.690> while<00:03:20.690> I'm<00:03:20.870> not<00:03:21.050> quite<00:03:21.410> sure<00:03:21.440> where

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
Titan and while I'm not quite sure where

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.680 
Titan and while I'm not quite sure where
it<00:03:21.920> goes<00:03:22.100> from<00:03:22.160> there<00:03:22.400> they<00:03:23.330> will<00:03:23.450> probably

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
it goes from there they will probably

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.540 
it goes from there they will probably
experimenting<00:03:24.380> quite<00:03:24.620> a<00:03:24.650> bit<00:03:24.830> with<00:03:24.950> how<00:03:25.220> large

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
experimenting quite a bit with how large

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.370 
experimenting quite a bit with how large
the<00:03:25.790> shield<00:03:26.060> should<00:03:26.330> be<00:03:26.450> and<00:03:26.690> how<00:03:26.810> fast<00:03:27.050> the

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
the shield should be and how fast the

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.530 
the shield should be and how fast the
recharge<00:03:27.830> timer<00:03:28.100> and<00:03:28.340> that<00:03:28.430> should<00:03:28.610> be<00:03:28.760> and<00:03:28.940> so

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
recharge timer and that should be and so

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.420 
recharge timer and that should be and so
this<00:03:29.810> would<00:03:29.989> clearly<00:03:30.440> have<00:03:30.620> to<00:03:30.860> be<00:03:30.980> balanced

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
this would clearly have to be balanced

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.180 
this would clearly have to be balanced
in<00:03:31.489> with<00:03:31.730> that<00:03:31.970> but<00:03:32.750> focus<00:03:33.320> fire<00:03:33.590> is<00:03:33.890> the<00:03:34.040> way

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
in with that but focus fire is the way

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.080 
in with that but focus fire is the way
to<00:03:34.250> go<00:03:34.550> in<00:03:35.000> Titan<00:03:35.690> battles<00:03:36.080> and<00:03:36.320> so<00:03:37.060> yeah<00:03:38.060> I

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
to go in Titan battles and so yeah I

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.820 
to go in Titan battles and so yeah I
didn't<00:03:38.540> hard<00:03:38.810> to<00:03:38.930> see<00:03:39.080> where<00:03:39.230> this<00:03:39.320> fits<00:03:39.530> in

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
didn't hard to see where this fits in

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.800 
didn't hard to see where this fits in
but<00:03:40.400> in<00:03:40.580> the<00:03:40.670> end<00:03:40.760> I<00:03:40.850> think<00:03:40.880> she'll<00:03:41.300> don't<00:03:41.630> play

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
but in the end I think she'll don't play

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.870 
but in the end I think she'll don't play
enough<00:03:42.019> of<00:03:42.170> a<00:03:42.260> role<00:03:42.560> in<00:03:42.860> the<00:03:42.980> game<00:03:43.190> for<00:03:43.640> it<00:03:43.730> to

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
enough of a role in the game for it to

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.910 
enough of a role in the game for it to
really<00:03:44.060> be<00:03:44.300> something<00:03:44.930> you'd<00:03:45.200> want<00:03:45.470> to<00:03:45.680> use

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
really be something you'd want to use

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.860 
really be something you'd want to use
that<00:03:46.250> and<00:03:47.000> you'd<00:03:47.150> put<00:03:47.360> yourself<00:03:47.690> at<00:03:47.780> a

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
that and you'd put yourself at a

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.920 
that and you'd put yourself at a
disadvantage<00:03:48.080> in<00:03:48.620> a<00:03:48.709> 1v1<00:03:49.070> Titan<00:03:49.610> fight<00:03:49.930> the

interesting comments about the

interesting comments about the

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
development of the Sidewinder and how it

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.580 
development of the Sidewinder and how it
became<00:03:56.269> essentially<00:03:56.810> an<00:03:56.870> assault<00:03:57.200> rifle<00:03:57.260> that

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
became essentially an assault rifle that

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.280 
became essentially an assault rifle that
shoots<00:03:57.980> micro<00:03:58.489> missiles<00:03:58.820> and<00:03:59.150> the<00:03:59.810> two<00:04:00.050> mods

we find in the code include a tank

we find in the code include a tank

titans<00:04:04.160> you<00:04:04.970> can<00:04:05.060> see<00:04:05.239> why<00:04:05.360> that<00:04:05.390> took<00:04:05.810> that

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
titans you can see why that took that

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.320 
titans you can see why that took that
out<00:04:06.050> why<00:04:06.650> would<00:04:06.830> you<00:04:06.980> want<00:04:07.250> to<00:04:07.310> need<00:04:07.790> a<00:04:08.000> mod<00:04:08.300> for

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
out why would you want to need a mod for

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.660 
out why would you want to need a mod for
more<00:04:08.870> Titan<00:04:09.380> damage<00:04:09.709> on<00:04:09.860> an<00:04:09.980> anti<00:04:10.280> Titan

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
more Titan damage on an anti Titan

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.180 
more Titan damage on an anti Titan
weapon<00:04:11.030> that's<00:04:11.239> just<00:04:11.570> that<00:04:12.230> silly<00:04:12.530> and<00:04:12.769> a

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
weapon that's just that silly and a

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.150 
weapon that's just that silly and a

this<00:04:16.310> is<00:04:16.430> all<00:04:16.549> about<00:04:16.669> hipfire<00:04:17.510> and<00:04:17.959> random

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
this is all about hipfire and random

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.490 
this is all about hipfire and random
spray<00:04:19.190> I<00:04:19.489> just<00:04:20.479> hard<00:04:20.750> to<00:04:20.870> see<00:04:21.019> how<00:04:21.140> that<00:04:21.320> fits

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
spray I just hard to see how that fits

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.550 
spray I just hard to see how that fits
in<00:04:22.240> there<00:04:23.240> are<00:04:23.419> two<00:04:23.660> fairly<00:04:23.930> basic<00:04:24.169> mods

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
in there are two fairly basic mods

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.350 
in there are two fairly basic mods
listed<00:04:24.919> for<00:04:25.130> the<00:04:25.190> mag<00:04:25.340> launcher<00:04:25.729> first<00:04:26.060> high

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
listed for the mag launcher first high

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.600 
listed for the mag launcher first high
density<00:04:26.870> for<00:04:27.350> more<00:04:27.650> damage<00:04:28.010> with<00:04:28.039> a<00:04:28.250> lower

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
density for more damage with a lower

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.279 
density for more damage with a lower
rate<00:04:28.820> of<00:04:28.940> fire<00:04:29.120> I'm<00:04:29.390> guessing<00:04:29.780> that<00:04:29.810> probably

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289 
rate of fire I'm guessing that probably

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:31.360 
rate of fire I'm guessing that probably
paired<00:04:30.650> with<00:04:30.860> not<00:04:31.130> be

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
paired with not be

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.450

able<00:04:31.610> to<00:04:31.699> shoot<00:04:31.910> the<00:04:32.120> grenades<00:04:32.449> as<00:04:32.660> far<00:04:32.930> and

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
able to shoot the grenades as far and

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.490 
able to shoot the grenades as far and
high-powered<00:04:34.460> magnets<00:04:34.940> more<00:04:35.630> magnetic<00:04:36.050> range

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
high-powered magnets more magnetic range

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.250 
high-powered magnets more magnetic range
but<00:04:36.889> less<00:04:37.250> damage<00:04:37.790> yeah<00:04:38.600> that's<00:04:38.900> the<00:04:39.080> whole

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
but less damage yeah that's the whole

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260 
but less damage yeah that's the whole
this<00:04:39.620> is<00:04:39.800> easy<00:04:40.040> to<00:04:40.310> use<00:04:40.550> so<00:04:40.820> it<00:04:40.940> should<00:04:41.120> have

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
this is easy to use so it should have

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.320 
this is easy to use so it should have
less<00:04:41.570> potential<00:04:42.050> effectiveness<00:04:42.620> thing

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
less potential effectiveness thing

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.850 
less potential effectiveness thing
battlefield<00:04:44.330> 4<00:04:44.570> did<00:04:45.020> that<00:04:45.169> I'm<00:04:45.350> glad

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
battlefield 4 did that I'm glad

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.320 
battlefield 4 did that I'm glad
titanfall<00:04:46.340> didn't<00:04:46.790> go<00:04:46.940> in<00:04:47.060> that<00:04:47.150> direction

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
titanfall didn't go in that direction

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.870 
titanfall didn't go in that direction
but<00:04:48.199> neither<00:04:48.500> of<00:04:48.770> those<00:04:48.889> mods<00:04:49.160> would<00:04:49.460> change

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
but neither of those mods would change

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.400 
but neither of those mods would change
the<00:04:50.090> feel<00:04:50.330> of<00:04:50.360> the<00:04:50.570> weapon<00:04:50.870> too<00:04:51.020> much<00:04:51.169> you<00:04:51.380> just

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
the feel of the weapon too much you just

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.920 
the feel of the weapon too much you just
still<00:04:51.770> spam<00:04:52.130> grenades<00:04:52.550> at<00:04:52.790> the<00:04:52.940> Titans<00:04:53.330> so<00:04:53.900> I

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
still spam grenades at the Titans so I

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.480 
still spam grenades at the Titans so I
can<00:04:54.440> see<00:04:54.560> why<00:04:54.710> they<00:04:54.889> didn't<00:04:55.100> go<00:04:55.220> with<00:04:55.370> either

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
can see why they didn't go with either

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.520 
can see why they didn't go with either
of<00:04:55.639> them<00:04:55.790> and<00:04:56.050> balancing<00:04:57.050> the<00:04:57.169> high-density

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.409 
of them and balancing the high-density
ones<00:04:57.979> could<00:04:58.190> be<00:04:58.340> a<00:04:58.370> real<00:04:58.580> mess<00:04:58.880> I<00:04:59.090> mean<00:04:59.240> which

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
ones could be a real mess I mean which

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:01.719 
ones could be a real mess I mean which
DPS<00:04:59.900> do<00:05:00.110> you<00:05:00.169> try<00:05:00.350> to<00:05:00.410> balance<00:05:00.590> against<00:05:01.100> the

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:01.729 
DPS do you try to balance against the

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:03.580 
DPS do you try to balance against the
average<00:05:02.210> one<00:05:02.449> when<00:05:02.630> you<00:05:02.690> include<00:05:02.930> the<00:05:03.169> reloads

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
average one when you include the reloads

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.409 
average one when you include the reloads
because<00:05:04.310> you're<00:05:04.430> going<00:05:04.520> to<00:05:04.580> get<00:05:04.699> more<00:05:04.940> damage

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
because you're going to get more damage

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:08.320 
because you're going to get more damage
in<00:05:05.660> each<00:05:05.870> magazine<00:05:06.139> or<00:05:06.639> the<00:05:07.639> one<00:05:07.850> just<00:05:08.120> within

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:14.389 
what if the grenades just rolled across

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:15.969 
what if the grenades just rolled across

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
all over the place maybe that would make

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.330 
all over the place maybe that would make
it<00:05:17.990> so<00:05:18.110> you<00:05:18.289> didn't<00:05:18.620> show<00:05:18.800> up<00:05:18.830> on<00:05:19.100> the<00:05:19.220> minimap

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
it so you didn't show up on the minimap

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.370 
it so you didn't show up on the minimap
when<00:05:19.820> you<00:05:19.910> fired<00:05:20.210> that<00:05:20.750> would<00:05:20.840> be<00:05:20.960> interesting

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380

the mag launcher does have a certain

the mag launcher does have a certain

grenades detonate automatically much

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.689 
grenades detonate automatically much
much<00:05:30.050> faster<00:05:30.289> and<00:05:30.560> so<00:05:30.770> you<00:05:30.830> can't<00:05:31.220> do<00:05:31.430> a<00:05:31.460> lot<00:05:31.669> of

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:31.699 
much faster and so you can't do a lot of

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:34.840 
much faster and so you can't do a lot of
things<00:05:31.940> that<00:05:32.120> they<00:05:32.570> do<00:05:32.630> in<00:05:32.900> that<00:05:32.960> game<00:05:33.760> next<00:05:34.760> we

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850 
things that they do in that game next we

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.570 
things that they do in that game next we
have<00:05:35.030> the<00:05:35.090> 40<00:05:35.660> millimeter<00:05:36.110> cannon<00:05:36.650> this<00:05:37.099> got<00:05:37.370> a

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
have the 40 millimeter cannon this got a

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.659 
have the 40 millimeter cannon this got a
lot<00:05:38.000> of<00:05:38.030> love<00:05:38.919> splasher<00:05:39.919> rounds<00:05:40.310> more

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
lot of love splasher rounds more

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.260 
lot of love splasher rounds more
explosive<00:05:41.270> range<00:05:41.510> with<00:05:42.020> lower<00:05:42.289> direct<00:05:42.740> damage

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
explosive range with lower direct damage

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.190 
explosive range with lower direct damage
so<00:05:44.270> let's<00:05:44.479> see<00:05:44.630> that<00:05:44.810> would<00:05:44.900> be<00:05:44.960> more

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
so let's see that would be more

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.990 
so let's see that would be more
effective<00:05:45.289> against<00:05:45.919> infantry<00:05:46.280> especially

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
effective against infantry especially

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.940 
effective against infantry especially
minions<00:05:47.450> when<00:05:47.630> they're<00:05:47.720> all<00:05:47.840> bunched<00:05:48.139> up<00:05:48.440> and

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
minions when they're all bunched up and

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.409 
minions when they're all bunched up and
be<00:05:49.099> sure<00:05:49.280> to<00:05:49.310> hit<00:05:49.550> several<00:05:49.849> of<00:05:50.090> them<00:05:50.210> at<00:05:50.300> the

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:50.419 
be sure to hit several of them at the

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:52.210 
be sure to hit several of them at the
same<00:05:50.570> time<00:05:50.780> right<00:05:51.080> now<00:05:51.139> it<00:05:51.410> might<00:05:51.620> take<00:05:51.979> an

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
same time right now it might take an

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.640 
same time right now it might take an
extra<00:05:52.789> shot<00:05:53.000> with<00:05:53.750> the<00:05:53.990> regular<00:05:54.320> 40

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
extra shot with the regular 40

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.230 
extra shot with the regular 40
millimeter<00:05:55.039> and<00:05:55.250> the<00:05:55.310> splasher<00:05:55.789> might<00:05:56.090> have

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
millimeter and the splasher might have

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.480 
millimeter and the splasher might have
cut<00:05:56.419> that<00:05:56.570> down<00:05:56.840> a<00:05:56.900> little<00:05:57.050> bit<00:05:57.380> and<00:05:58.130> not<00:05:58.430> a

cut that down a little bit and not a

cut that down a little bit and not a
huge<00:05:58.849> change<00:05:59.180> and<00:05:59.510> hard<00:05:59.690> to<00:05:59.810> see<00:05:59.990> how<00:06:00.110> it's

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 
huge change and hard to see how it's

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.770 
huge change and hard to see how it's
really<00:06:00.590> easy<00:06:00.830> to<00:06:00.979> balance<00:06:01.539> next<00:06:02.539> there's<00:06:02.720> a

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 
really easy to balance next there's a

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.500 
really easy to balance next there's a
tank<00:06:03.229> buster<00:06:03.530> mod<00:06:03.919> and<00:06:04.220> this<00:06:04.849> is<00:06:05.000> a<00:06:05.030> converting

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 
tank buster mod and this is a converting

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.330 
tank buster mod and this is a converting
all<00:06:05.630> the<00:06:05.780> impact<00:06:06.139> damage<00:06:06.349> into<00:06:06.710> explosive

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
all the impact damage into explosive

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.279 
all the impact damage into explosive
damage<00:06:07.520> at<00:06:08.210> least<00:06:08.449> as<00:06:08.599> it<00:06:08.750> is<00:06:08.870> in<00:06:09.020> the<00:06:09.080> code

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:09.289 
damage at least as it is in the code

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:10.810 
damage at least as it is in the code
right<00:06:09.470> now<00:06:09.530> it<00:06:09.889> would<00:06:10.070> be<00:06:10.220> incredibly

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820 
right now it would be incredibly

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.450 
right now it would be incredibly
overpowered<00:06:11.660> but<00:06:12.380> at<00:06:12.680> the<00:06:12.770> same<00:06:12.979> time<00:06:13.160> how<00:06:13.430> is

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
overpowered but at the same time how is

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.189 
overpowered but at the same time how is
that<00:06:13.760> different<00:06:14.270> because<00:06:14.750> if<00:06:14.900> you<00:06:14.990> still

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:15.199 
that different because if you still

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:16.900 
that different because if you still
score<00:06:15.470> an<00:06:15.560> impact<00:06:15.979> you<00:06:16.190> end<00:06:16.340> up<00:06:16.430> doing<00:06:16.699> more

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:16.910 
score an impact you end up doing more

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.060 
score an impact you end up doing more
damage<00:06:17.060> with<00:06:17.300> a<00:06:17.419> tank<00:06:17.720> buster<00:06:17.960> I'm<00:06:18.650> guessing

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.070 
damage with a tank buster I'm guessing

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.800 
damage with a tank buster I'm guessing
that<00:06:19.099> would<00:06:19.310> have<00:06:19.460> to<00:06:19.580> be<00:06:19.610> spared<00:06:20.120> with<00:06:20.330> slower

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
that would have to be spared with slower

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.469 
that would have to be spared with slower
projectile<00:06:21.470> speed<00:06:21.849> not<00:06:22.849> really<00:06:23.060> sure<00:06:23.240> what's

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:23.479 
projectile speed not really sure what's

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:25.900 
projectile speed not really sure what's
going<00:06:23.539> on<00:06:23.810> here<00:06:24.080> and<00:06:24.490> finally<00:06:25.490> there<00:06:25.699> is<00:06:25.729> the

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:25.910 
going on here and finally there is the

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.270 
going on here and finally there is the
mortar<00:06:26.479> shot<00:06:26.780> which<00:06:27.349> is<00:06:27.470> essentially<00:06:27.979> twenty

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280 
mortar shot which is essentially twenty

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.089 
mortar shot which is essentially twenty
percent<00:06:28.550> more<00:06:28.789> damage<00:06:29.210> but<00:06:29.930> only<00:06:30.320> ten<00:06:30.620> ammo<00:06:30.949> in

core<00:06:38.720> so<00:06:39.229> the<00:06:39.260> fact<00:06:39.710> that<00:06:39.800> this<00:06:39.950> is<00:06:40.130> doing<00:06:40.370> that

core so the fact that this is doing that
to<00:06:40.729> kind<00:06:41.000> of<00:06:41.120> takes<00:06:41.300> away<00:06:41.390> from<00:06:41.570> the

us<00:06:45.139> to<00:06:45.289> have<00:06:45.319> their<00:06:45.590> own<00:06:45.620> roles<00:06:46.180> you<00:06:47.180> don't<00:06:47.330> use

00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:47.599 
us to have their own roles you don't use

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:48.879 
us to have their own roles you don't use
them<00:06:47.840> any<00:06:47.960> differently<00:06:48.319> as<00:06:48.470> far<00:06:48.650> as<00:06:48.770> I<00:06:48.830> can

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:48.889 
them any differently as far as I can

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:51.159 
them any differently as far as I can
tell<00:06:49.009> so<00:06:49.430> and<00:06:49.639> it<00:06:50.180> would<00:06:50.479> be<00:06:50.599> hard<00:06:50.840> to<00:06:50.900> tell

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:51.169 
tell so and it would be hard to tell

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:52.450 
tell so and it would be hard to tell
which<00:06:51.409> one<00:06:51.620> you<00:06:51.740> were<00:06:51.830> up<00:06:52.009> against<00:06:52.280> because

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:52.460 
which one you were up against because

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.339 
which one you were up against because
someone's<00:06:52.759> just<00:06:52.939> firing<00:06:53.330> single<00:06:53.900> shots<00:06:54.169> at

00:06:54.339 --> 00:06:54.349 
someone's just firing single shots at

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:56.350 
someone's just firing single shots at
you<00:06:54.500> and<00:06:54.710> so<00:06:55.189> it<00:06:55.340> still<00:06:55.550> seems<00:06:55.819> like<00:06:56.000> the<00:06:56.150> same

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 
you and so it still seems like the same

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.270 
you and so it still seems like the same
old<00:06:56.389> 40<00:06:56.870> millimeter<00:06:57.259> so<00:06:57.500> again<00:06:57.680> I<00:06:57.710> can<00:06:57.949> see<00:06:58.129> why

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.280 
old 40 millimeter so again I can see why

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.640 
old 40 millimeter so again I can see why
they<00:06:58.490> said<00:06:58.699> not<00:06:59.539> that<00:06:59.569> unique<00:06:59.960> let's<00:07:00.409> go<00:07:00.530> ahead

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:00.650 
they said not that unique let's go ahead

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:01.990 
they said not that unique let's go ahead
and<00:07:00.800> get<00:07:01.159> it<00:07:01.310> out<00:07:01.430> of<00:07:01.460> the<00:07:01.610> game<00:07:01.789> and

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.000 
and get it out of the game and

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.029 
and get it out of the game and
ultimately<00:07:02.689> I<00:07:03.080> think<00:07:03.169> players<00:07:03.530> would<00:07:03.770> tend<00:07:03.949> to

00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:04.039 
ultimately I think players would tend to

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:05.559 
ultimately I think players would tend to
gravitate<00:07:04.219> towards<00:07:04.849> the<00:07:05.000> best<00:07:05.180> all-around

00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:05.569 
gravitate towards the best all-around

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:08.140 
gravitate towards the best all-around
choice<00:07:06.080> unless<00:07:06.409> they<00:07:07.009> knew<00:07:07.250> exactly<00:07:07.729> what

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:08.150 
choice unless they knew exactly what

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:09.700 
choice unless they knew exactly what

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:09.710 
situation they were going to be in and

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.129 
situation they were going to be in and
for<00:07:10.490> the<00:07:10.520> charge<00:07:10.819> rifle<00:07:11.210> surprisingly<00:07:11.840> there

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:12.139 
for the charge rifle surprisingly there

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:14.379 
for the charge rifle surprisingly there

version<00:07:14.810> I<00:07:14.990> guess<00:07:15.469> they<00:07:15.650> found<00:07:15.800> something

00:07:16.059 --> 00:07:16.069 
version I guess they found something

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:17.469

experimenting<00:07:18.050> with<00:07:18.379> it<00:07:18.620> well<00:07:19.490> that<00:07:19.669> was<00:07:19.819> a

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:19.849 
experimenting with it well that was a

00:07:19.849 --> 00:07:21.399 
experimenting with it well that was a
quick<00:07:20.090> look<00:07:20.330> at<00:07:20.479> some<00:07:20.509> of<00:07:20.690> the<00:07:20.900> weapon<00:07:21.229> mods

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:21.409 
quick look at some of the weapon mods

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:23.170 
quick look at some of the weapon mods
that<00:07:21.590> didn't<00:07:22.129> make<00:07:22.280> the<00:07:22.340> cut<00:07:22.580> in<00:07:22.819> titanfall

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:23.180 
that didn't make the cut in titanfall

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.909 
that didn't make the cut in titanfall
let<00:07:24.050> me<00:07:24.110> know<00:07:24.199> what<00:07:24.289> you<00:07:24.409> thought<00:07:24.560> there's

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:24.919 
let me know what you thought there's

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:26.499 
let me know what you thought there's
certainly<00:07:25.250> a<00:07:25.370> lot<00:07:25.460> more<00:07:25.699> code<00:07:26.090> and<00:07:26.300> we<00:07:26.360> can

00:07:26.499 --> 00:07:26.509 
certainly a lot more code and we can

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:28.029 
certainly a lot more code and we can
talk<00:07:26.690> more<00:07:26.719> about<00:07:27.020> this<00:07:27.229> and<00:07:27.409> speculate<00:07:28.009> on

00:07:28.029 --> 00:07:28.039 
talk more about this and speculate on

00:07:28.039 --> 00:07:30.790 
talk more about this and speculate on
why<00:07:28.759> things<00:07:29.120> got<00:07:29.569> in<00:07:29.780> and<00:07:29.960> why<00:07:30.139> things<00:07:30.199> didn't

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800 
why things got in and why things didn't

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.800 
why things got in and why things didn't
and<00:07:31.009> some<00:07:31.460> possibilities<00:07:32.060> you<00:07:32.419> know<00:07:32.479> wait<00:07:32.569> let

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:32.810 
and some possibilities you know wait let

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:33.580 
and some possibilities you know wait let
me<00:07:32.840> know<00:07:32.900> what<00:07:33.080> you<00:07:33.199> thought<00:07:33.319> of<00:07:33.379> the<00:07:33.500> video

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:33.590
