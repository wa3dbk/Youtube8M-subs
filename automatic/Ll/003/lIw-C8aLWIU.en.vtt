00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.310 
balance her core her hips everything all
of<00:00:23.119> our<00:00:23.179> weights<00:00:23.390> carried<00:00:23.750> right<00:00:23.900> there<00:00:24.140> and

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
of our weights carried right there and

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.470 
of our weights carried right there and
the<00:00:25.009> key<00:00:25.189> is<00:00:25.339> not<00:00:25.519> to<00:00:25.580> let<00:00:25.849> this<00:00:25.970> get<00:00:26.150> behind

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
the key is not to let this get behind

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.630 
the key is not to let this get behind
the<00:00:26.570> baseline<00:00:27.070> for<00:00:28.070> your<00:00:28.189> players<00:00:28.400> that<00:00:28.550> are

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
the baseline for your players that are

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.800 
the baseline for your players that are
working<00:00:28.789> on<00:00:28.880> their<00:00:28.970> Quick<00:00:29.179> Reaction<00:00:29.359> if<00:00:29.720> they

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
working on their Quick Reaction if they

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.060 
working on their Quick Reaction if they
let<00:00:29.960> it<00:00:30.050> get<00:00:30.109> behind<00:00:30.349> the<00:00:30.410> baseline<00:00:30.710> that

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
let it get behind the baseline that

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.560 
let it get behind the baseline that
means<00:00:31.579> they<00:00:31.759> probably<00:00:31.849> wouldn't<00:00:32.240> be<00:00:32.329> there<00:00:32.450> in

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
means they probably wouldn't be there in

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.880 
means they probably wouldn't be there in
time<00:00:32.780> to<00:00:32.930> set<00:00:33.110> up<00:00:33.140> to<00:00:33.320> hit<00:00:33.380> the<00:00:33.530> ball<00:00:33.650> how<00:00:33.770> they

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.010 
lots of little steps good that's good
balance<00:01:37.280> let's<00:01:37.460> do<00:01:37.580> one<00:01:37.729> more<00:01:37.760> here<00:01:38.510> we<00:01:38.630> go

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
balance let's do one more here we go

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.710 
balance let's do one more here we go
okay<00:01:39.590> ready<00:01:40.060> go<00:01:43.060> excellent<00:01:44.060> job<00:01:44.210> way<00:01:44.450> to<00:01:44.510> stay

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
okay ready go excellent job way to stay

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.330 
okay ready go excellent job way to stay
with<00:01:44.870> the<00:01:44.930> ball<00:01:45.080> so<00:01:45.380> you<00:01:45.710> can<00:01:45.830> see<00:01:45.979> how<00:01:46.159> this

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
with the ball so you can see how this

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.830 
with the ball so you can see how this
ball<00:01:46.520> again<00:01:46.850> helps<00:01:47.120> her<00:01:47.210> take<00:01:47.360> lots<00:01:47.570> of<00:01:47.630> little

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
ball again helps her take lots of little

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.840 
ball again helps her take lots of little
steps<00:01:48.049> going<00:01:48.350> forward<00:01:48.520> just<00:01:49.520> like<00:01:49.640> you<00:01:49.729> would

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
steps going forward just like you would

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.100 
steps going forward just like you would
if<00:01:49.940> you're<00:01:50.060> hitting<00:01:50.210> an<00:01:50.360> approach<00:01:50.600> shot<00:01:50.630> or

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
if you're hitting an approach shot or

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.510 
if you're hitting an approach shot or
even<00:01:51.470> moving<00:01:51.650> forward<00:01:51.950> for<00:01:52.100> the<00:01:52.159> ball<00:01:52.310> and

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
even moving forward for the ball and

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.770 
even moving forward for the ball and
we're<00:01:52.640> doing<00:01:52.700> another<00:01:52.970> variation<00:01:53.240> again<00:01:53.659> this

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
we're doing another variation again this

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.660 
we're doing another variation again this
might<00:01:53.930> be<00:01:54.080> for<00:01:54.200> more<00:01:54.530> advanced<00:01:54.830> players<00:01:54.950> I'm

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
might be for more advanced players I'm

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.070 
might be for more advanced players I'm
in<00:01:55.790> training<00:01:56.000> she's<00:01:56.420> got<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.720> lateral

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
in training she's got the lateral

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.870 
in training she's got the lateral
resistor<00:01:57.500> on<00:01:57.650> as<00:01:57.830> well<00:01:58.070> so<00:01:58.400> this<00:01:58.520> would<00:01:58.700> want

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
resistor on as well so this would want

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.789 
resistor on as well so this would want
to<00:01:58.970> use<00:01:59.090> strictly<00:01:59.869> for<00:02:00.110> her<00:02:00.200> moving<00:02:00.530> to<00:02:00.710> her

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
to use strictly for her moving to her

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.830 
to use strictly for her moving to her
left<00:02:01.040> and<00:02:01.220> moving<00:02:01.430> to<00:02:01.610> her<00:02:01.700> right<00:02:01.940> and<00:02:02.240> staying

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
left and moving to her right and staying

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.130 
left and moving to her right and staying
down<00:02:03.080> low<00:02:03.350> that's<00:02:03.920> it<00:02:04.220> cover<00:02:04.700> back<00:02:04.970> good<00:02:05.240> sit

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
down low that's it cover back good sit

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.609 
down low that's it cover back good sit
stay<00:02:06.440> low

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
stay low

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.830 
stay low
and<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.340> can<00:02:08.459> see<00:02:08.670> just<00:02:08.879> making<00:02:09.330> her<00:02:09.450> in<00:02:09.720> this

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
and you can see just making her in this

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.750 
and you can see just making her in this
lateral<00:02:10.319> resistor<00:02:10.679> how<00:02:10.830> low<00:02:11.129> she's<00:02:11.459> staying

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
lateral resistor how low she's staying

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.330 
lateral resistor how low she's staying
because<00:02:12.390> she<00:02:12.540> has<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.989> stay<00:02:13.200> low<00:02:13.440> with<00:02:14.280> that

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
because she has to stay low with that

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.460 
because she has to stay low with that
resistance<00:02:15.030> on<00:02:15.209> her<00:02:15.330> on<00:02:15.780> her<00:02:15.900> legs<00:02:16.140> if<00:02:16.349> she

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
resistance on her on her legs if she

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.050 
resistance on her on her legs if she
gets<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.860> straight<00:02:17.190> up<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.459> down<00:02:17.519> she's<00:02:17.910> out

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
gets to straight up and down she's out

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.550 
gets to straight up and down she's out
of<00:02:18.209> balance<00:02:18.540> just<00:02:18.870> like<00:02:19.019> when<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.230> move<00:02:19.349> to<00:02:19.410> a

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
of balance just like when you move to a

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.140 
of balance just like when you move to a
tennis<00:02:19.920> ball<00:02:20.099> you<00:02:20.129> want<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.430> be<00:02:20.550> nice<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:20.760> low

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
tennis ball you want to be nice and low

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.440 
tennis ball you want to be nice and low
that's<00:02:22.019> awesome
