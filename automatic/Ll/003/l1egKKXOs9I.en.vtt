 banks 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.980
 no 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.990
 this party 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.579
 moreover we sent a missile on tokyo 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:24.560
 it's a stunt 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.560
 once more and more expensive 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.180
 mclaren 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.340
 picture any clause 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.990
 m 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.360
 nothing helps to highlight 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.030
 back to France 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 The tone is set 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.030
 nothing on the missile too much 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.680
 should a wave amplifier 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.680
 but how to find a 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.730
 to the question 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.240
 Exactly what I needed 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.500
 then time is running out 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.530
 he says he's all is on the floor 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:18.419
 still a successful mission 

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:19.839
 luckily by the way 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:22.839
 more than it's far 5 laplaud 

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:24.309
