and let's get started um folding this
paper<00:00:19.660> onto<00:00:20.660> itself<00:00:23.710> full<00:00:24.730> four<00:00:25.730> times<00:00:31.660> so

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
paper onto itself full four times so

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.180 
paper onto itself full four times so
both<00:00:33.110> diagonals<00:00:33.410> and<00:00:34.040> then<00:00:34.100> down<00:00:34.730> each<00:00:34.940> Center

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.060 
up go ahead and fold the corner pieces
back<00:01:22.550> out<00:01:22.820> I<00:01:23.390> know<00:01:24.260> it<00:01:24.380> seems<00:01:24.560> a<00:01:24.680> teeny<00:01:24.890> bit

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
back out I know it seems a teeny bit

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:34.510 
back out I know it seems a teeny bit
redundant<00:01:25.580> of<00:01:25.910> origami<00:01:33.250> okay

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
redundant of origami okay

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.160 
redundant of origami okay
then<00:01:35.270> you<00:01:35.360> take<00:01:35.570> your<00:01:35.960> first<00:01:36.680> two<00:01:36.800> pieces<00:01:37.130> and

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
then you take your first two pieces and

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.320 
then you take your first two pieces and
you're<00:01:39.170> going<00:01:39.320> to<00:01:39.380> want<00:01:39.620> to<00:01:39.680> take<00:01:40.090> these<00:01:41.090> two

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
you're going to want to take these two

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.560 
you're going to want to take these two
corners<00:01:41.600> and<00:01:41.930> slide<00:01:42.650> them<00:01:42.890> into<00:01:43.610> these<00:01:44.210> two

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
corners and slide them into these two

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.730 
corners and slide them into these two
corners<00:01:45.280> see<00:01:46.280> how<00:01:46.340> it<00:01:46.460> slides<00:01:46.550> right<00:01:46.880> in<00:01:47.030> there

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
corners see how it slides right in there

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.960 
corners see how it slides right in there
and<00:01:49.150> then<00:01:50.150> you<00:01:50.840> take<00:01:51.620> this<00:01:51.830> Center<00:01:52.220> fold<00:01:52.490> and

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
and then you take this Center fold and

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.230 
and then you take this Center fold and
you<00:01:53.780> just<00:01:54.190> make<00:01:55.190> a<00:01:55.220> little<00:01:55.340> point<00:01:55.760> for<00:01:56.120> your

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
you just make a little point for your

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.900 
you just make a little point for your
star<00:01:56.540> I<00:01:56.810> have<00:01:57.380> two<00:01:57.530> points<00:01:57.890> and<00:01:58.160> you<00:01:58.190> go<00:01:58.820> ahead

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
star I have two points and you go ahead

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.660 
star I have two points and you go ahead
and<00:01:59.090> do<00:01:59.150> that<00:01:59.270> for<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:00.979> first<00:02:01.220> four<00:02:01.430> pieces

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
and do that for the first four pieces

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.219 
and do that for the first four pieces
and<00:02:02.030> then<00:02:02.120> the<00:02:02.210> fifth<00:02:02.450> piece<00:02:02.690> I'll<00:02:02.990> show<00:02:03.170> you

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
and then the fifth piece I'll show you

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.110 
and then the fifth piece I'll show you
when<00:02:03.590> we<00:02:03.650> get<00:02:03.770> to<00:02:03.830> it<00:02:04.100> so<00:02:04.430> now<00:02:04.700> you've<00:02:04.940> done

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
when we get to it so now you've done

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.969 
when we get to it so now you've done
four<00:02:05.540> pieces<00:02:05.780> you<00:02:05.960> only<00:02:06.200> have<00:02:06.410> this<00:02:06.680> fifth

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
four pieces you only have this fifth

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.859 
four pieces you only have this fifth
piece<00:02:07.190> left<00:02:07.430> what<00:02:08.390> you're<00:02:08.510> going<00:02:08.630> to<00:02:08.660> want<00:02:08.840> to

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
piece left what you're going to want to

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.380 
piece left what you're going to want to
do<00:02:08.990> is<00:02:09.200> slide<00:02:09.470> this<00:02:10.460> last<00:02:10.820> piece<00:02:11.090> on<00:02:11.270> the

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
do is slide this last piece on the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.360 
do is slide this last piece on the
inside<00:02:11.780> of<00:02:11.810> both<00:02:12.230> of<00:02:12.470> these<00:02:12.590> pieces<00:02:12.950> that<00:02:13.280> are

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
inside of both of these pieces that are

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.699 
inside of both of these pieces that are
already<00:02:13.550> here<00:02:13.940> it's<00:02:14.540> kind<00:02:14.780> of<00:02:14.900> it's<00:02:15.620> not

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
already here it's kind of it's not

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.400 
already here it's kind of it's not
tricky<00:02:16.040> but<00:02:16.400> it<00:02:16.670> is<00:02:17.209> a<00:02:17.239> little<00:02:17.540> bit<00:02:17.840> more

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
tricky but it is a little bit more

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.100 
tricky but it is a little bit more
time-consuming<00:02:18.680> than<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.520> other<00:02:19.670> pieces

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
time-consuming than the other pieces

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.140 
time-consuming than the other pieces
just<00:02:21.110> slide<00:02:21.440> it<00:02:21.590> in<00:02:21.709> on<00:02:21.830> that<00:02:21.980> side<00:02:22.220> and<00:02:22.520> then

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
just slide it in on that side and then

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.940 
just slide it in on that side and then
slide<00:02:23.450> it<00:02:23.570> on<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:23.780> inside<00:02:24.080> on<00:02:24.260> this<00:02:24.410> side<00:02:24.680> and

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
slide it on the inside on this side and

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.900 
slide it on the inside on this side and
that<00:02:25.370> will<00:02:25.489> help<00:02:25.610> hold<00:02:25.850> your<00:02:26.060> star<00:02:26.420> into<00:02:26.810> place

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
that will help hold your star into place

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.400 
that will help hold your star into place
now<00:02:28.910> what<00:02:29.270> I<00:02:29.300> do<00:02:29.420> is<00:02:29.510> I<00:02:29.720> just<00:02:29.750> punch<00:02:30.110> a<00:02:30.230> hole<00:02:30.350> in

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
now what I do is I just punch a hole in

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:44.390 
now what I do is I just punch a hole in
the<00:02:30.560> top

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:52.520 

and<00:02:45.400> then<00:02:46.209> string<00:02:46.660> a<00:02:46.990> string<00:02:47.080> or<00:02:47.590> yarn<00:02:47.770> through

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.110 

and<00:02:53.530> then<00:02:53.860> I<00:02:54.069> also<00:02:54.390> because<00:02:55.390> I<00:02:55.420> just<00:02:55.810> use<00:02:56.110> one

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
and then I also because I just use one

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.250 
and then I also because I just use one
certain<00:02:58.120> color<00:02:58.300> wrapping<00:02:58.690> paper<00:02:58.870> for<00:02:59.140> each

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
certain color wrapping paper for each

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.070 
certain color wrapping paper for each
