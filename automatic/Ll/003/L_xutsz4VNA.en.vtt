00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
have two in a row right here these two

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.950 
have two in a row right here these two
corners<00:01:40.130> like<00:01:41.130> next<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:41.970> each<00:01:42.060> other<00:01:42.210> and

these corners are still not the right

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.080 
these corners are still not the right

three<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.479> all<00:02:03.600> then<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:05.070> wrong<00:02:05.460> sides<00:02:05.790> were

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
three and all then the wrong sides were

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.330 
three and all then the wrong sides were
here<00:02:06.899> so<00:02:07.590> now<00:02:07.799> we're<00:02:07.950> going<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.129> face<00:02:08.310> that

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
here so now we're going to face that

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.950 
here so now we're going to face that
towards<00:02:08.849> us<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.300> do<00:02:09.420> three<00:02:09.959> on<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.319> left<00:02:10.530> side

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
towards us and do three on the left side

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:20.960 
towards us and do three on the left side
one<00:02:14.000> two<00:02:16.370> three<00:02:18.140> now<00:02:19.140> we<00:02:19.770> have<00:02:20.280> all<00:02:20.610> of<00:02:20.850> these

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
one two three now we have all of these

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.190 
one two three now we have all of these
corners<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:22.350> correct<00:02:22.920> way<00:02:23.480> in<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.750> correct

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
corners the correct way in the correct

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.590 
corners the correct way in the correct
place<00:02:28.910> sometimes<00:02:29.910> you'll<00:02:30.150> be<00:02:30.270> in<00:02:30.330> a<00:02:30.390> situation

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
place sometimes you'll be in a situation

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.470 
place sometimes you'll be in a situation
like<00:02:31.200> this<00:02:31.350> where<00:02:31.950> you<00:02:32.040> can't<00:02:32.310> get<00:02:32.490> any<00:02:33.000> sides

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
like this where you can't get any sides

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.140 
like this where you can't get any sides
next<00:02:33.990> to<00:02:34.110> each<00:02:34.230> other<00:02:34.530> correct<00:02:34.920> only<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:36.000> one

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
next to each other correct only the one

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.410 
next to each other correct only the one
across<00:02:36.390> from<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:37.010> or<00:02:38.010> just<00:02:38.910> one<00:02:39.630> side<00:02:39.890> so<00:02:41.420> see

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
across from it or just one side so see

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.780 
across from it or just one side so see
we<00:02:42.900> only<00:02:43.020> have<00:02:43.260> one<00:02:43.590> right<00:02:44.130> here<00:02:44.370> that<00:02:44.610> isn't

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
we only have one right here that isn't

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.180 
we only have one right here that isn't
the<00:02:45.300> correct<00:02:45.630> place<00:02:45.900> we<00:02:46.470> can't<00:02:46.740> get<00:02:46.890> any<00:02:47.070> of

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
the correct place we can't get any of

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.860 
the correct place we can't get any of
the<00:02:47.310> other<00:02:47.460> ones<00:02:47.550> by<00:02:47.790> twisting<00:02:48.240> it<00:02:48.390> this<00:02:48.720> way

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
the other ones by twisting it this way

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.770 
the other ones by twisting it this way
or<00:02:49.020> that<00:02:49.050> way<00:02:49.760> so<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.820> do<00:02:51.090> this<00:02:51.270> you<00:02:51.660> need

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
or that way so to do this you need

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.050 
or that way so to do this you need
anywhere<00:02:52.380> on<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.620> cube<00:02:52.890> I'm<00:02:53.490> holding<00:02:53.880> it<00:02:54.030> with

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
anywhere on the cube I'm holding it with

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.320 
anywhere on the cube I'm holding it with
white<00:02:55.050> on<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.290> bottom<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.730> cross<00:02:56.970> on<00:02:57.240> the

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
white on the bottom and the cross on the

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.710 
white on the bottom and the cross on the
top<00:02:58.070> so<00:02:59.070> just<00:02:59.130> do<00:02:59.610> three<00:03:00.150> on<00:03:00.210> the<00:03:00.390> left<00:03:00.570> side

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
top so just do three on the left side

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.460 
top so just do three on the left side
like<00:03:00.990> we<00:03:01.110> did<00:03:01.260> last<00:03:01.410> time<00:03:03.020> face<00:03:04.020> that<00:03:04.230> side

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
like we did last time face that side

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.380 
like we did last time face that side
towards<00:03:04.740> you<00:03:04.950> three<00:03:05.400> on<00:03:05.520> the<00:03:05.670> left<00:03:05.910> side<00:03:08.390> and

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
towards you three on the left side and

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.510 
towards you three on the left side and
we<00:03:09.540> should<00:03:09.750> be<00:03:09.900> able<00:03:09.990> to<00:03:10.080> put<00:03:10.290> two<00:03:10.560> in<00:03:10.830> a<00:03:10.920> row<00:03:11.100> so

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
we should be able to put two in a row so

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:20.150 
we should be able to put two in a row so
here's<00:03:11.730> a<00:03:11.790> one<00:03:12.770> see<00:03:13.770> here<00:03:18.440> two<00:03:19.440> now<00:03:19.920> we<00:03:20.010> have

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
here's a one see here two now we have

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.760 
here's a one see here two now we have
these<00:03:20.430> two<00:03:20.489> in<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:21.630> correct<00:03:21.900> spot<00:03:22.140> so<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:22.680> now

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
these two in the correct spot so and now

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.229 
these two in the correct spot so and now
we<00:03:22.800> can<00:03:23.070> just<00:03:23.100> do<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.430> wrong<00:03:23.580> sides<00:03:23.910> in<00:03:24.150> the

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
we can just do the wrong sides in the

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.530 
we can just do the wrong sides in the
right<00:03:24.390> hand<00:03:24.630> 360<00:03:25.200> means<00:03:27.410> turn<00:03:28.410> it<00:03:28.500> towards<00:03:28.739> us

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
right hand 360 means turn it towards us

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.930 
right hand 360 means turn it towards us
left<00:03:32.870> there<00:03:33.870> now<00:03:34.709> we<00:03:34.770> have<00:03:34.950> all<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.610> corners

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
left there now we have all the corners

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.550 
left there now we have all the corners
correct<00:03:36.239> again<00:03:36.780> this<00:03:36.989> step<00:03:37.260> we're<00:03:37.410> going<00:03:37.500> to

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
correct again this step we're going to

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.620 
correct again this step we're going to
learn<00:03:37.830> how<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.370> put<00:03:38.700> all<00:03:38.940> these<00:03:39.120> corner<00:03:39.510> pieces

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
learn how to put all these corner pieces

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.449 
learn how to put all these corner pieces
in<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:39.989> correct<00:03:40.230> spot<00:03:40.500> toward<00:03:40.739> this<00:03:41.010> orange

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
in the correct spot toward this orange

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:42.920 
in the correct spot toward this orange
is<00:03:41.610> right<00:03:41.790> here<00:03:41.970> in<00:03:42.060> this<00:03:42.180> blues<00:03:42.480> right<00:03:42.720> here

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
is right here in this blues right here

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.400 
is right here in this blues right here
so<00:03:43.140> we'll<00:03:43.320> all<00:03:43.709> match<00:03:44.160> and<00:03:44.850> make<00:03:45.000> a<00:03:45.170> line<00:03:46.170> right

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
so we'll all match and make a line right

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.110 
so we'll all match and make a line right
here<00:03:46.620> first<00:03:47.160> step<00:03:47.340> in<00:03:47.459> doing<00:03:47.580> this<00:03:47.730> is<00:03:48.000> we're

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
here first step in doing this is we're

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.610 
here first step in doing this is we're
gonna<00:03:48.209> have<00:03:48.390> to<00:03:48.480> take<00:03:48.600> the<00:03:48.780> top<00:03:49.019> cross<00:03:49.320> the

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
gonna have to take the top cross the

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.460 
gonna have to take the top cross the
yellow<00:03:49.920> cross<00:03:50.220> and<00:03:50.640> flip<00:03:51.330> it<00:03:51.450> over<00:03:51.570> so<00:03:52.170> we<00:03:52.200> have

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
yellow cross and flip it over so we have

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.080 
yellow cross and flip it over so we have
the<00:03:52.590> white<00:03:52.769> on<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:53.070> top<00:03:53.130> and<00:03:53.519> these<00:03:53.850> two

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
the white on the top and these two

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.810 
the white on the top and these two
layers<00:03:54.330> on<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.900> top<00:03:54.930> awesome<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:56.459> bottom

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
layers on the top awesome and the bottom

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.470 
layers on the top awesome and the bottom
cross<00:03:57.180> right<00:03:57.420> here<00:03:58.790> then<00:03:59.790> we'll<00:04:00.000> have<00:04:00.150> to<00:04:00.269> find

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
cross right here then we'll have to find

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.870 
cross right here then we'll have to find
sometimes<00:04:01.080> you<00:04:01.260> might<00:04:01.440> have<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:02.190> some

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
sometimes you might have the some

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.090 
sometimes you might have the some
already<00:04:03.090> done<00:04:03.390> but<00:04:04.080> they<00:04:04.260> might<00:04:04.440> not<00:04:04.590> be<00:04:04.800> in

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
already done but they might not be in

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.790 
already done but they might not be in
the<00:04:05.280> correct<00:04:05.489> spots<00:04:05.760> so<00:04:06.720> what<00:04:07.410> you<00:04:07.500> want<00:04:07.650> to<00:04:07.680> do

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
the correct spots so what you want to do

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.440 
the correct spots so what you want to do
is<00:04:07.860> you<00:04:07.950> want<00:04:08.100> to<00:04:08.160> find<00:04:08.280> that<00:04:08.459> one<00:04:08.670> that's<00:04:09.030> not

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
is you want to find that one that's not

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.530 
is you want to find that one that's not
done<00:04:09.720> yet<00:04:09.930> like<00:04:10.560> this<00:04:10.769> one<00:04:11.010> and<00:04:11.220> do<00:04:11.700> sex<00:04:12.209> moves

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
done yet like this one and do sex moves

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.590 
done yet like this one and do sex moves
until<00:04:12.930> it<00:04:13.440> is<00:04:13.620> done<00:04:13.800> no<00:04:15.890> no

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
to look at the bottom or else we'll mess

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.300 
to look at the bottom or else we'll mess
this<00:04:36.130> all<00:04:36.430> this<00:04:36.729> up<00:04:36.970> right<00:04:37.270> here<00:04:37.479> so<00:04:38.009> you<00:04:39.009> find

another<00:04:39.550> one<00:04:39.820> oh<00:04:55.560> it's<00:04:56.560> right<00:04:56.680> there<00:04:56.889> already

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
another one oh it's right there already

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.969 
another one oh it's right there already
last<00:04:58.210> one<00:04:59.850> there<00:05:00.850> now<00:05:01.090> we<00:05:01.150> have<00:05:01.419> all<00:05:01.660> of<00:05:01.810> this

last one there now we have all of this

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:09.719 
last one there now we have all of this
in<00:05:02.979> the<00:05:03.130> correct<00:05:03.490> place<00:05:07.110> now<00:05:08.110> we<00:05:08.169> have<00:05:08.729> three

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
in the correct place now we have three

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:12.089 
in the correct place now we have three
of<00:05:10.270> these<00:05:10.599> dots<00:05:11.169> in<00:05:11.380> the<00:05:11.440> middle<00:05:11.710> that<00:05:11.740> are<00:05:11.919> in

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:12.099 
of these dots in the middle that are in

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:14.159 
of these dots in the middle that are in
the<00:05:12.190> wrong<00:05:12.340> with<00:05:13.330> all<00:05:13.510> these<00:05:13.720> other<00:05:13.900> sides

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
the wrong with all these other sides

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:19.020 
the wrong with all these other sides
correct<00:05:14.590> and<00:05:14.860> one<00:05:15.370> side<00:05:15.610> already<00:05:15.940> done<00:05:17.729> so<00:05:18.729> now

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
correct and one side already done so now

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.820 
correct and one side already done so now
we<00:05:19.090> are<00:05:19.360> going<00:05:19.509> to<00:05:19.660> learn<00:05:19.720> how<00:05:19.900> to<00:05:20.020> finish<00:05:20.530> off

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
we are going to learn how to finish off

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.490 
we are going to learn how to finish off
the<00:05:21.009> cube<00:05:21.280> and<00:05:21.840> complete<00:05:22.840> first<00:05:23.139> thing<00:05:23.320> you're

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
the cube and complete first thing you're

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.219 
the cube and complete first thing you're
going<00:05:23.650> to<00:05:23.770> need<00:05:24.039> to<00:05:24.250> do<00:05:24.400> is<00:05:24.699> put<00:05:25.270> the<00:05:25.750> already

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
going to need to do is put the already

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.820 
going to need to do is put the already
made<00:05:26.860> side<00:05:27.190> in<00:05:27.910> front<00:05:28.599> of<00:05:28.780> you<00:05:28.900> so<00:05:29.650> you<00:05:29.740> have

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
made side in front of you so you have

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.710 
made side in front of you so you have
the<00:05:29.979> white<00:05:30.160> on<00:05:30.310> the<00:05:30.430> bottom<00:05:30.550> and<00:05:31.180> yellow<00:05:31.510> on

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
the white on the bottom and yellow on

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.159 
the white on the bottom and yellow on
the<00:05:31.840> top<00:05:32.460> then<00:05:33.460> you<00:05:33.699> want<00:05:34.030> to<00:05:34.060> find<00:05:34.270> which<00:05:34.780> of

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.169 
the top then you want to find which of

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:38.129 
the top then you want to find which of
these<00:05:35.409> small<00:05:36.310> dots<00:05:36.490> at<00:05:36.760> the<00:05:36.789> top<00:05:36.880> needs<00:05:37.780> to<00:05:38.020> go

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:38.139 
these small dots at the top needs to go

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:42.300 
these small dots at the top needs to go
to<00:05:38.199> the<00:05:38.560> front<00:05:39.000> to<00:05:40.000> the<00:05:40.030> back<00:05:40.150> I<00:05:40.659> should<00:05:41.050> say<00:05:41.310> so

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
to the front to the back I should say so

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.189 
to the front to the back I should say so
orange<00:05:42.990> orange

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:44.199 
orange orange

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:47.700 
orange orange
so<00:05:44.409> this<00:05:44.800> thought<00:05:45.099> matches<00:05:45.610> this<00:05:45.880> side<00:05:46.710> and

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
so this thought matches this side and

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.790 
so this thought matches this side and
this<00:05:48.310> thought<00:05:48.580> does<00:05:49.030> not<00:05:49.300> match<00:05:49.539> this<00:05:49.780> side<00:05:50.020> so

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
this thought does not match this side so

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.620 
this thought does not match this side so
we're<00:05:50.949> going<00:05:51.070> to<00:05:51.370> need<00:05:51.610> to<00:05:51.760> do<00:05:51.880> a<00:05:51.909> sex<00:05:52.210> move<00:05:52.449> on

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
we're going to need to do a sex move on

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.270 
we're going to need to do a sex move on
the<00:05:52.720> side<00:05:52.930> that<00:05:53.080> does<00:05:53.320> match<00:05:53.560> so<00:05:54.010> it<00:05:54.070> matches

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
the side that does match so it matches

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.250 
the side that does match so it matches
on<00:05:54.520> this<00:05:54.699> side<00:05:54.880> let's<00:05:55.419> do<00:05:55.539> one<00:05:55.780> on<00:05:55.930> this<00:05:56.080> side

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
on this side let's do one on this side

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.580 
on this side let's do one on this side
and<00:05:56.530> then<00:05:56.919> of<00:05:57.430> course<00:05:57.490> one<00:05:57.880> on<00:05:58.000> the<00:05:58.120> other<00:05:58.590> and

00:05:59.580 --> 00:05:59.590 
and then of course one on the other and

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.550 
and then of course one on the other and
should<00:06:00.130> look<00:06:00.250> like<00:06:00.310> this<00:06:01.080> then<00:06:02.080> what<00:06:02.320> you<00:06:02.440> need

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
should look like this then what you need

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:09.680 
should look like this then what you need
to<00:06:02.620> do<00:06:02.800> is<00:06:03.010> do<00:06:03.190> five<00:06:03.669> on<00:06:04.060> the<00:06:04.389> left<00:06:04.539> side<00:06:04.860> 1<00:06:05.860> 2<00:06:07.949> 3

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
to do is do five on the left side 1 2 3

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:15.899 
to do is do five on the left side 1 2 3
4<00:06:11.490> 5<00:06:13.320> there<00:06:14.320> now<00:06:14.770> we<00:06:14.860> have<00:06:15.010> this<00:06:15.250> side<00:06:15.490> done<00:06:15.639> and

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:15.909 
4 5 there now we have this side done and

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:17.420 
4 5 there now we have this side done and
do<00:06:16.120> five<00:06:16.389> on<00:06:16.599> the<00:06:16.780> right

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
do five on the right

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:22.770 
do five on the right
1<00:06:18.930> 2<00:06:19.930> 3

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:22.780 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.760 

for<00:06:24.180> five<00:06:25.180> and<00:06:25.660> we<00:06:25.900> have<00:06:25.930> completed<00:06:26.500> the

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:26.770 
for five and we have completed the

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
for five and we have completed the
Rubik's<00:06:27.160> Cube<00:06:28.920> this<00:06:29.920> time<00:06:30.130> I'm<00:06:30.340> going<00:06:30.520> to<00:06:30.640> do

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:30.790 
Rubik's Cube this time I'm going to do

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.760 
Rubik's Cube this time I'm going to do
the<00:06:30.910> same<00:06:31.090> thing<00:06:31.330> as<00:06:31.450> last<00:06:31.600> time<00:06:31.930> I'm<00:06:32.530> just

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:32.770 
the same thing as last time I'm just

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:34.200 
the same thing as last time I'm just
going<00:06:33.010> to<00:06:33.100> do<00:06:33.190> it<00:06:33.220> on<00:06:33.400> the<00:06:33.490> right<00:06:33.640> side<00:06:33.880> so<00:06:33.910> you

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210 
going to do it on the right side so you

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.320 
going to do it on the right side so you
can<00:06:34.330> straighten<00:06:34.840> your<00:06:34.990> head<00:06:35.230> so<00:06:36.130> blue<00:06:36.850> matches

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.330 
can straighten your head so blue matches

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.890 
can straighten your head so blue matches
up<00:06:37.660> with<00:06:37.780> the<00:06:37.900> blue<00:06:38.500> back<00:06:38.830> and<00:06:39.690> orange<00:06:40.690> does

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:40.900 
up with the blue back and orange does

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.390 
up with the blue back and orange does
not<00:06:40.930> match<00:06:41.290> up<00:06:41.530> so<00:06:41.560> we<00:06:41.860> need<00:06:42.040> to<00:06:42.100> start<00:06:42.280> with

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 
not match up so we need to start with

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.540 
not match up so we need to start with
the<00:06:42.460> right<00:06:42.640> side<00:06:42.910> so<00:06:43.660> do<00:06:43.810> one<00:06:43.990> on<00:06:44.110> the<00:06:44.200> right

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
the right side so do one on the right

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:57.540 
the right side so do one on the right
one<00:06:45.550> on<00:06:45.580> the<00:06:45.730> left<00:06:46.200> five<00:06:47.200> on<00:06:47.380> the<00:06:47.470> right<00:06:56.550> five

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:57.550 
one on the left five on the right five

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.550 
one on the left five on the right five
there<00:06:58.450> it's<00:06:58.750> just<00:06:58.960> the<00:06:59.080> same<00:06:59.320> thing<00:06:59.530> but

00:06:59.550 --> 00:06:59.560 
there it's just the same thing but

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.940 
there it's just the same thing but
reverse<00:07:01.470> sometimes<00:07:02.470> you'll<00:07:02.680> be<00:07:02.800> in<00:07:02.890> a

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:02.950 
reverse sometimes you'll be in a

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.670 
reverse sometimes you'll be in a
situation<00:07:03.550> where<00:07:04.150> all<00:07:04.419> of<00:07:04.870> these<00:07:05.140> top<00:07:05.470> pieces

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:05.680 
situation where all of these top pieces

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.460 
situation where all of these top pieces
are<00:07:06.640> not<00:07:06.940> in<00:07:07.060> the<00:07:07.150> correct<00:07:07.390> place<00:07:07.660> to<00:07:07.930> where

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:08.470 
are not in the correct place to where

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.710 
are not in the correct place to where
the<00:07:08.770> one<00:07:09.040> that<00:07:09.370> one<00:07:09.610> side<00:07:09.910> is<00:07:09.940> not<00:07:10.390> in<00:07:10.600> the

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 
the one that one side is not in the

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.130 
the one that one side is not in the
right<00:07:10.810> spot<00:07:10.990> so<00:07:11.790> to<00:07:12.790> fix<00:07:13.030> this<00:07:13.150> all<00:07:13.780> you<00:07:13.990> need

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:14.140 
right spot so to fix this all you need

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.690 
right spot so to fix this all you need
to<00:07:14.260> do<00:07:14.380> is<00:07:14.500> just<00:07:14.650> the<00:07:14.830> same<00:07:15.100> thing<00:07:15.280> as<00:07:15.310> else<00:07:15.580> I

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:15.700 
to do is just the same thing as else I

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:16.890 
to do is just the same thing as else I
mean<00:07:15.850> it<00:07:15.970> doesn't<00:07:16.120> matter<00:07:16.270> which<00:07:16.540> side<00:07:16.570> you

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:16.900 
mean it doesn't matter which side you

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.550 
mean it doesn't matter which side you
start<00:07:17.169> this<00:07:17.350> X<00:07:17.560> to<00:07:17.650> move<00:07:17.800> on<00:07:18.390> or<00:07:19.390> what<00:07:20.260> side

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 
start this X to move on or what side

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.750 
start this X to move on or what side
that<00:07:20.740> you're<00:07:20.860> doing<00:07:21.040> it<00:07:21.280> on<00:07:21.370> to<00:07:21.550> make<00:07:21.730> sure

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:21.760 
that you're doing it on to make sure

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.700 
that you're doing it on to make sure
it's<00:07:22.330> still<00:07:22.720> you're<00:07:22.990> holding<00:07:23.320> it<00:07:23.440> the<00:07:23.530> correct

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:23.710 
it's still you're holding it the correct

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.190 
it's still you're holding it the correct
way<00:07:23.860> with<00:07:24.460> the<00:07:24.760> yellow<00:07:25.090> on<00:07:25.240> the<00:07:25.450> top<00:07:25.840> and<00:07:26.080> the
