00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
agent the best product to fertilize with

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.740 
agent the best product to fertilize with
is<00:02:02.180> a<00:02:02.510> good<00:02:02.870> slow<00:02:03.440> release<00:02:03.799> fertilizer<00:02:04.750> the

is a good slow release fertilizer the

is a good slow release fertilizer the
only<00:02:06.110> thing<00:02:06.350> better<00:02:06.560> is<00:02:06.799> one<00:02:07.250> with<00:02:07.430> a<00:02:07.460> wetting

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909
