00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.090
 so hello i am since Vitek and now hackers of the analysis of 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.120
 Accenture have fun 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.550
 and let's go 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.960
 Luisi 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.960
 is it a third so kills old ones to be there 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.720
 in the next song "hard" 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.230
 Moritz I had to get closer to you 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.990
 How can help detect struggling tests yet with gas masks 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.660
 after easy-to-do and zombie Synergy researchers soldiers 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.620
 Armenia 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.430
 the new Perg 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.810
 the Nova Sammys we do not know 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.810
 then, first, has with 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.760
 Euro what do you think two new playable characters 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.159
 I'll go to Suhl Nicolai Nicolai with a beard 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.710
 but without his cap could also be new characters 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.490
 Cioffi but these are skilled judges open 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.490
 "We'll see I'm going to Landshut a bit more 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.500
 Now that's what you mean 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.690
 form 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.690
 So from my side looks like that 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 Descendants initially sap-title also exciting 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.590
 Year like that 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.700
 Heikkinen appeared in the park 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.900
 maybe something like that 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.030
 Looks pretty cool, I'm feeling a gentle swing 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.490
 Lord hardly mean to the new 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.010
 because quotes 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.050
 it looks like it is possible to collect and let go 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.960
 I do not think I'll sue the Andes until now, but that's cool stuff 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.169
 let's see how that is hopefully better 

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:16.049
 or not as honest as dogs sometimes 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.189
 lost in their already correctly valued DAX 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:21.509
 because in Kassel get from me 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:23.789
 Let's see how the intention to beat 

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:26.789
 or the takeover because unclear 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:32.279
 so i hope i made it to now have another video 

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:34.359
 stay away from the entire Schoeller 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:36.979
 the streets Schauer Witteck 

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:37.659
 this kind
