 Dezaki Although everyone like your visit to the press hall was seeing the new cm 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:54.790
 As I mentioned earlier, I live in an open city full of greenery and surrounded by the sea and the sky 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:59.620
 Such as comes through happiness's state of the family 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:05.890
 Such a situation was impressive, but I wondered if Ekaku-san was to be treated 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:07.540
 Already blessed with the weather, it feels very good so yes yes yes 5000 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.750

 Take it with that camera with a propeller 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:24.590

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:29.909
 Well, such an element is really transmitted to you cm 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:34.760

 I think the weather was really fine on the day and it was about the end of April . 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:51.630
 Using meaning Bridge park there Toka is a trace park towards the shooting 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.960
 Very op fact that bet people you live extra to state that I was asked to have 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.510

 Arima yu sugi said that you said though I realized it once again 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:06.700
 The scenery that seems to be really rich 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:11.830
 I think I can take it 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:17.560
 Thank you very much, Nan , you also appeared to Mr. Ekaka cm 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.610
 It is a town in the Gulf area where it appeared and it has been seen by everyone . 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.310
 As you are 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:26.720
 Many parenting families are spending time in parks and Lalafa on holidays 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.700
 In addition, Tokyo Wonderful Project 12th edition 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:34.610
 At Bay's Tower &amp; Garden from people living in the Bay Area 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:40.310
 We have received a lot of response 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:43.520
 This guest salon completion announcement this time to examine the background of the situation that went 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.710
 And by now according to the new cm recital 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:50.640
 small school high school it 3 prefecture 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:53.670
 Fathers and mothers with children below school level 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:59.880
 Living environment for 300 people 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:05.190
 In particular, we conducted an Internet survey on the relationship between commuting time and happiness 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:06.700
 I think that you understand if you can refer to the materials you have handed out to you 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:14.260
 According to this survey result 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:19.930
 If your husband's commuting time is short, your wife's happiness will be better than those who have long commuting time 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:24.490
 For about 10% higher The husband is more of a short person is commuting time is 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:30.070
 The result shows that I am satisfied with how I relate to childcare 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:36.520
 It is a premise that this relationship is good Yes yes yes yes and more 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:37.870
 Number is thought to want to reduce the about 50% of commuting time in order to spend more time with their children 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:44.610
 I'm sorry 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:53.280
 Especially about 70% of dad more than 1 hour commuting time is that I think so 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:59.220
 Yes I guess a decade ago a man is and woman working in the outside, depending on the idea of protecting the house sumo Mom 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:01.350
 Being told from the perspective of children and children, and being able to choose 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.600
 I think there were many 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:09.640
 The current was home of the way and belly family 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:12.850
 There is the way of 9 even if we have made a wide variety The man himself is his own 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:16.300
 Named Ikumen about childcare participation 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:22.990
 And now the acquisition rate of parental leave is laughing 

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:24.590
 A symbol that it has changed to the viewpoint and choice of living in a town where dad can easily participate in childcare 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.889
 Results were seen 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:31.629
 Do not meet I think it is 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:37.599
 Especially if the child is small, it will grow quickly. 

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:44.259
 Comparatively that the Tteyuu painful time together of because you mon There is said was a 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:46.449
 Children say become about Well another junior high school students once singing I'm'm early land 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:46.880
 We also It will continue to self-reliance 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:52.910
 Ten 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:53.810
 It 's been born, I guess it's been a while for a little over 10 years, and my father will surely grow at that time 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:59.510
 I 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:04.280
 It's right in particular recently Would not you want to see even a little bit with that kind of thinking 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:06.110
 Mr. or growth but dad is what is referred to as a mom is increasing of such as this 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.900
 In response to this survey 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:12.180
 How to 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:15.660
 I wonder if that's about my general overview of the project overview 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.980
 I explained it but still this 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:22.860
 The situation is very 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:27.180
 It is near the downtown area, so it is the fourth floor 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:29.569
 Well yeah it is also not a person or so children come 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:34.309
 Still to because to workplaces close to each other 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:37.830
 Because we have been led to take a lot of their time 

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:43.230
 Well such a place is really that 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:48.780
 In fact, our customers who are visiting this guest salon are also very much 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:51.230
 I feel that I have sympathy, so this questionnaire is true 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:56.510
 I guess that's right 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:06:04.010
 That's right, as you said earlier that Mr. Ekado, your child's growth is fast. 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:07.100
 That shift to a town where it is easy for dad to take part in childcare , thinking about that and choosing that place to live 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:11.220
 Also it is that many people that say are 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:18.690
 By the way, I think that Izumi-san has children with prestige 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:19.969
 How But for such an ideal living environment for Esumi's to grow your child 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:25.549
 Yu 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:28.759
 It seems that I was born and raised in Izumo City, Shimane. 

00:06:25.549 --> 00:06:34.760
 Running around in the back mountain of wear 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:39.200
 And Furea' that still nature and directly say so or make a secret base 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:46.280
 Of course, that study is switched even if we go to junior high school again 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:48.440
 You Although still among that age is watching actually using the five senses with a whole that this body 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:53.000
 Listen and touch 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:59.060
 Because parenting can feel thinks Once be nice can now I also Well 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.920
 Also completed I now of the children and how Tarie take me to do it, but as much as possible park live in Tokyo 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.610
 The item is not in front of you 

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:06.780
 That 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:11.100
 All the supermarkets 20 are lined with fish and of course all vegetables in perfect condition 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:18.440
 But after all I went to see that field 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:21.470
 I really have a heart out about getting things done and experiencing them 

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:24.440
 It is because it is the present child 

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:29.930
 Such as touch to its it was of the essence 

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:30.920
 I'm touching nature, but I would like to touch children I also worked with 

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:36.470
 Mofu 

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:39.680
 If I'm studying at school I would like to spend the rest of the day in nature 

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:43.840
 I feel like I'm already going out naturally 

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.840
 Thank you It is there as a nice absolute
