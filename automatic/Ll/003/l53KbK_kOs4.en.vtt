this<00:01:20.869> ideas<00:01:21.869> we<00:01:22.170> are<00:01:22.470> Swedish<00:01:23.630> which<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:25.170> only

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
this ideas we are Swedish which the only

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.020 
this ideas we are Swedish which the only
way<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.619> prove<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.220> by<00:01:26.460> going<00:01:26.640> by<00:01:26.970> these

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
way to prove that is by going by these

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.010 
way to prove that is by going by these
IDs<00:01:28.400> and<00:01:30.860> one<00:01:31.860> tricky<00:01:32.189> thing<00:01:32.490> about<00:01:33.020> doing

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
IDs and one tricky thing about doing

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.899 
IDs and one tricky thing about doing
this<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.710> started<00:01:35.340> as<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> noble

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
this is that I started as a noble

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.090 
this is that I started as a noble
Republic<00:01:36.450> yes<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.320> didn't<00:01:37.619> start<00:01:37.799> from<00:01:37.920> the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
Republic yes I didn't start from the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.440 
Republic yes I didn't start from the
very<00:01:38.310> start<00:01:39.060> date<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.750> started<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.530> bit<00:01:41.159> later<00:01:41.460> so

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
very start date I started a bit later so

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.230 
very start date I started a bit later so
that<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.659> could<00:01:42.899> actually<00:01:42.930> be<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.409> republic<00:01:44.040> and

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
that I could actually be a republic and

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.700 
that I could actually be a republic and
check<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.390> check<00:01:45.630> out<00:01:45.750> how<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.680> that

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
check it check out how that is and that

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.609 
check it check out how that is and that
means<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:48.299> don't<00:01:48.450> get<00:01:48.600> anything<00:01:49.079> from<00:01:49.439> this

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
means you don't get anything from this

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.969 
means you don't get anything from this
first<00:01:49.890> idea<00:01:50.270> nothing<00:01:51.680> because<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.829> only

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
first idea nothing because that only

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.080 
first idea nothing because that only
works<00:01:53.310> on<00:01:53.490> monarchies<00:01:54.090> em<00:01:55.340> but<00:01:56.340> what<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.520> really

was<00:04:27.110> over<00:04:27.470> here<00:04:27.980> and<00:04:29.200> because<00:04:30.670> some<00:04:31.670> of<00:04:31.790> this

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
was over here and because some of this

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:43.510 
was over here and because some of this
was<00:04:32.510> I<00:04:36.970> think<00:04:37.970> no<00:04:40.540> well<00:04:41.540> two<00:04:42.380> of<00:04:42.620> these<00:04:42.800> over

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
was I think no well two of these over

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.260 
was I think no well two of these over
here<00:04:43.730> in<00:04:44.060> the<00:04:44.480> 13<00:04:44.780> colonies<00:04:45.260> were<00:04:45.500> Spanish<00:04:46.270> at

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
here in the 13 colonies were Spanish at

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.250 
here in the 13 colonies were Spanish at
one<00:04:47.660> point<00:04:48.220> but<00:04:49.390> they<00:04:50.390> were<00:04:50.510> still<00:04:50.690> colonies

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
one point but they were still colonies

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.650 
one point but they were still colonies
they<00:04:51.890> were<00:04:51.950> not<00:04:52.310> full-fledged<00:04:52.910> provinces

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
they were not full-fledged provinces

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.110 
they were not full-fledged provinces
they<00:04:54.440> were<00:04:54.560> not<00:04:54.740> declared<00:04:54.860> war<00:04:55.280> so<00:04:55.580> I<00:04:55.610> simply

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
they were not declared war so I simply

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.740 
they were not declared war so I simply
went<00:04:56.810> in<00:04:57.020> and<00:04:57.170> to<00:04:57.290> go<00:04:57.470> over<00:04:57.500> them

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
went in and to go over them

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.240 
went in and to go over them
unfortunately<00:04:59.750> this<00:05:00.320> one<00:05:00.620> was<00:05:00.860> still<00:05:01.160> a

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
unfortunately this one was still a

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.450 
unfortunately this one was still a
colony<00:05:01.750> but<00:05:02.750> I<00:05:02.810> didn't<00:05:03.140> have<00:05:03.320> any<00:05:03.560> good<00:05:03.950> Navy

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
colony but I didn't have any good Navy

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.320 
colony but I didn't have any good Navy
to<00:05:05.000> stand<00:05:05.300> up<00:05:05.480> against<00:05:05.780> Spain's<00:05:06.140> Navy<00:05:07.090> so<00:05:08.090> they

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
to stand up against Spain's Navy so they

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.830 
to stand up against Spain's Navy so they
just<00:05:08.630> kept<00:05:09.350> this<00:05:09.620> and<00:05:10.090> kept<00:05:11.090> the<00:05:11.240> Navy<00:05:11.450> here<00:05:11.690> so

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
just kept this and kept the Navy here so

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:18.970 
just kept this and kept the Navy here so
I<00:05:11.870> could<00:05:12.050> have<00:05:12.140> much<00:05:12.380> of<00:05:12.590> it<00:05:16.810> but<00:05:17.810> as<00:05:18.650> you<00:05:18.710> can

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:18.980 
I could have much of it but as you can

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.100 
I could have much of it but as you can
see<00:05:19.040> in<00:05:19.310> this<00:05:19.460> late<00:05:19.730> game<00:05:20.000> I<00:05:20.240> have<00:05:20.510> some<00:05:20.750> level

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:04.480 
late earlier I think Spain started down
here<00:05:58.120> around<00:05:59.260> 1550<00:06:00.260> and<00:06:02.320> Portugal<00:06:03.320> around<00:06:03.980> the

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
here around 1550 and Portugal around the

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.140 
here around 1550 and Portugal around the
same<00:06:04.910> time<00:06:05.360> or<00:06:05.690> maybe<00:06:05.960> later<00:06:06.380> I<00:06:06.830> wasn't<00:06:07.790> going

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
same time or maybe later I wasn't going

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:13.660 
same time or maybe later I wasn't going
over<00:06:08.480> here<00:06:08.690> until<00:06:08.930> I<00:06:10.270> think<00:06:12.370> 1520<00:06:13.370> or

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:13.670 
over here until I think 1520 or

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:14.590 
over here until I think 1520 or
something<00:06:14.000> like<00:06:14.150> that

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.600 
something like that

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.520 
something like that
and<00:06:14.690> it<00:06:15.560> was<00:06:15.800> just<00:06:16.070> empty<00:06:16.340> I<00:06:17.240> couldn't<00:06:17.990> believe

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:18.530 
and it was just empty I couldn't believe

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.530 
and it was just empty I couldn't believe
my<00:06:19.010> luck<00:06:20.410> Spain<00:06:21.410> started<00:06:22.100> to<00:06:22.490> get<00:06:22.670> the<00:06:22.850> jump<00:06:23.210> in

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:23.540 
my luck Spain started to get the jump in

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.160 
my luck Spain started to get the jump in
on<00:06:23.870> a<00:06:23.930> few<00:06:24.500> points<00:06:24.860> but<00:06:25.340> I<00:06:25.820> I<00:06:26.330> crushed<00:06:26.750> him<00:06:26.900> at

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:27.170
