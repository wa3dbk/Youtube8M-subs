you<00:00:09.240> know<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.360> lot<00:00:09.540> of<00:00:09.570> conversation<00:00:10.380> these

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
you know a lot of conversation these

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.440 
you know a lot of conversation these
days<00:00:10.560> surrounding<00:00:11.310> transmissions<00:00:12.060> and<00:00:12.300> I

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
days surrounding transmissions and I

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.000 
days surrounding transmissions and I
understand<00:00:12.960> it<00:00:13.110> they're<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.560> critical

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.010 
understand it they're a critical

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.770 
understand it they're a critical
component<00:00:14.180> there's<00:00:15.180> the<00:00:15.300> things<00:00:15.540> that<00:00:15.690> they

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
component there's the things that they

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.810 
component there's the things that they
obviously<00:00:16.020> are<00:00:16.439> supposed<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:16.980> do<00:00:17.160> but<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.640> think

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
obviously are supposed to do but I think

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.070 
obviously are supposed to do but I think
I<00:00:17.880> think<00:00:18.060> you've<00:00:18.150> got<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.419> ask<00:00:18.509> yourself<00:00:18.960> is

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
I think you've got to ask yourself is

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.499 
I think you've got to ask yourself is
what<00:00:19.439> do<00:00:19.499> you<00:00:19.560> want<00:00:19.619> it<00:00:20.009> to<00:00:20.160> do<00:00:20.339> well<00:00:20.579> let<00:00:21.390> me

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:21.509 
what do you want it to do well let me

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:23.599 
what do you want it to do well let me
