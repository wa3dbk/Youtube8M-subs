transforming bottle mother pretty good I

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.420 
transforming bottle mother pretty good I
thought<00:00:39.000> they<00:00:39.210> possibly<00:00:39.930> know<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.280> little<00:00:41.280> bit

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
more intensity of break down on us

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.889 
more intensity of break down on us
pretty<00:00:44.579> aggressive<00:00:45.030> in<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.149> area<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.780> it's

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
pretty aggressive in that area and it's

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.020 
pretty aggressive in that area and it's
a<00:00:46.110> fact<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:47.039> think<00:00:47.100> from<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.489> standard<00:00:47.879> would

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
a fact I think from the standard would

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.900 
a fact I think from the standard would
blame<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.750> look<00:00:48.989> at<00:00:49.140> those<00:00:49.289> wise<00:00:49.620> old<00:00:49.910> simple

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
blame a look at those wise old simple

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.450 
blame a look at those wise old simple
theme<00:00:51.149> players<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.840> play<00:00:52.020> with

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
theme players and play with

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.389 
theme players and play with
and<00:00:54.460> how<00:00:54.699> low<00:00:55.449> their<00:00:55.480> goals<00:00:55.899> display<00:00:56.829> probably

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
and how low their goals display probably

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.340 
and how low their goals display probably
I'm<00:00:57.660> not<00:00:58.660> wish<00:00:58.930> that<00:00:58.960> I<00:00:59.309> 77<00:01:00.309> right<00:01:00.519> language

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
I'm not wish that I 77 right language

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.959 
I'm not wish that I 77 right language
which<00:01:02.350> is<00:01:02.500> an<00:01:02.620> area<00:01:02.920> that<00:01:02.949> we<00:01:03.430> need<00:01:03.579> to<00:01:03.610> remind

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
which is an area that we need to remind

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:09.240 
which is an area that we need to remind
Spencer<00:01:04.750> other<00:01:05.350> closely<00:01:05.619> I<00:01:06.060> think<00:01:07.060> it<00:01:07.150> a<00:01:08.250> sort

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
Spencer other closely I think it a sort

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.030 
Spencer other closely I think it a sort
of<00:01:09.340> a<00:01:09.580> separate<00:01:10.180> minute<00:01:10.420> gap<00:01:10.810> in<00:01:11.020> the<00:01:11.200> near<00:01:11.920> the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
of a separate minute gap in the near the

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.580 
of a separate minute gap in the near the
end<00:01:12.130> the<00:01:12.220> first<00:01:12.399> half<00:01:12.520> there<00:01:12.850> and<00:01:13.720> certainly

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
end the first half there and certainly

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.680 
end the first half there and certainly
probably<00:01:15.009> were<00:01:15.250> 30<00:01:15.729> minutes<00:01:16.060> or<00:01:16.119> someone<00:01:16.450> who

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
probably were 30 minutes or someone who

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.380 
probably were 30 minutes or someone who
wasn't<00:01:16.840> in<00:01:16.990> 20<00:01:17.290> minutes<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:18.850> know<00:01:18.940> I<00:01:18.970> think<00:01:19.240> we

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
wasn't in 20 minutes you know I think we

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.090 
wasn't in 20 minutes you know I think we
better<00:01:20.020> put<00:01:20.290> off<00:01:20.380> the<00:01:20.409> gas<00:01:20.530> a<00:01:20.710> little<00:01:20.860> bit

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
better put off the gas a little bit

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.539 
better put off the gas a little bit
there<00:01:21.280> then<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:23.110> roof<00:01:23.560> and<00:01:23.799> us<00:01:23.890> up<00:01:24.040> for<00:01:24.250> a

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
experience these guys they're pretty

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.180 
experience these guys they're pretty
opportunistic<00:01:37.780> then<00:01:38.409> they<00:01:38.619> need<00:01:38.890> all<00:01:39.039> of
