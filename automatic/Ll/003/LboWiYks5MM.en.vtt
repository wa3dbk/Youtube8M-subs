00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.770
 ask, I'll tell you about the information and then I'll show you the trailer 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.750
 anyone who considers himself a fan of the saga need for expide must be 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.400
 excited by the announcement of this new installment of the saga or maybe not all 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.180
 depends on whether Nestor explained j for his hit developed in conjunction with 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.110
 criterion never month even if you like it or not, it will have to be very 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.800
 reserved at the time of and stick with this veto forés pib should since the 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.110
 it seems the participation of criterion games or another developer company 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.420
 it is absent 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.920

 new york san francisco and las vegas also appear some scenarios in 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:25.220
 the mountains even in the snow it may be that need for spain should come to 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.060
 compete directly with the newly announced ridge racer unbounded at least 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.470
 in the atmosphere they seem a little bit although it is also hurried 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.330
 comparison since of both titles we have only been able to appreciate trailers 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.160

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.320
 too much to another title of the saga need for explained ander brawn with some 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.450
 elements of need for espí most wanted we will see later on what is 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.650
