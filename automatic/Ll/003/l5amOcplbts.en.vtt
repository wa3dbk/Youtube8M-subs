00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
USA drums at a much more accessible

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.099 
USA drums at a much more accessible
price<00:00:25.800> point<00:00:26.130> so<00:00:27.000> we<00:00:27.119> started<00:00:27.510> with<00:00:27.690> the<00:00:27.930> maple

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
price point so we started with the maple

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.349 
price point so we started with the maple
shells<00:00:28.529> using<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.430> same<00:00:29.640> maple<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:30.029> we<00:00:30.210> use

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
shells using the same maple that we use

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.179 
shells using the same maple that we use
on<00:00:30.539> our<00:00:30.689> higher-end<00:00:30.900> classic<00:00:31.560> maple<00:00:31.920> and

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
on our higher-end classic maple and

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.369 
on our higher-end classic maple and
other<00:00:32.579> products<00:00:33.089> we<00:00:33.449> molded<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:33.929> in<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.140> same

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379 
other products we molded it in the same

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:36.619 
other products we molded it in the same
molds<00:00:34.949> built<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.640> right<00:00:35.819> in<00:00:35.940> North<00:00:36.120> Carolina

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:36.629 
molds built it right in North Carolina

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:40.399 
molds built it right in North Carolina
and<00:00:38.269> we<00:00:39.269> did<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.449> little<00:00:39.690> bit<00:00:39.809> different<00:00:40.199> as<00:00:40.289> we

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:40.409 
and we did a little bit different as we

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:43.459 
and we did a little bit different as we
designed<00:00:40.769> the<00:00:40.949> drum<00:00:41.489> set<00:00:41.789> to<00:00:42.059> fit<00:00:42.269> in<00:00:42.479> a<00:00:43.109> single

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
designed the drum set to fit in a single

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.680 
designed the drum set to fit in a single
box<00:00:43.649> so<00:00:43.979> it's<00:00:44.100> got<00:00:44.280> all<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.269> shells<00:00:45.539> are

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
box so it's got all the shells are

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.719 
box so it's got all the shells are
nested<00:00:46.049> together<00:00:46.319> and<00:00:46.589> then<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.100> end<00:00:47.429> user

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:47.729 
nested together and then the end user

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:50.840 
nested together and then the end user
actually<00:00:48.059> assembles<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.079> drum<00:00:49.289> set<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:50.460> now

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
actually assembles the drum set and now

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.489 
actually assembles the drum set and now
we've<00:00:50.999> designed<00:00:51.359> all<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.749> components<00:00:52.289> on<00:00:52.379> the

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:52.499 
we've designed all the components on the

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:55.610 
we've designed all the components on the
drum<00:00:52.709> set<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.010> be<00:00:53.129> very<00:00:53.370> easy<00:00:53.429> to<00:00:53.819> assemble<00:00:54.620> the

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
drum set to be very easy to assemble the

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.860 
drum set to be very easy to assemble the
first<00:00:55.889> piece<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:56.459> instil<00:00:56.999> I<00:00:57.120> tug<00:00:57.449> and

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
first piece is this instil I tug and

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.599 
first piece is this instil I tug and
this<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.260> designed<00:00:58.619> to<00:00:58.769> install<00:00:59.159> with<00:00:59.429> no

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
this is designed to install with no

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.460 
this is designed to install with no
tools<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.299> no<00:01:00.539> screws<00:01:01.670> I<00:01:02.809> could<00:01:03.809> just<00:01:03.989> snap<00:01:04.260> it

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
tools and no screws I could just snap it

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.020 
tools and no screws I could just snap it
right<00:01:04.620> into<00:01:04.800> the<00:01:04.949> shell<00:01:05.190> and<00:01:05.550> it's<00:01:05.730> ready<00:01:05.940> to

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
right into the shell and it's ready to

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.690 
right into the shell and it's ready to
go<00:01:06.120> so<00:01:06.540> not<00:01:07.530> only<00:01:07.680> does<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:07.980> eliminate<00:01:08.520> well

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
go so not only does it eliminate well

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.520 
go so not only does it eliminate well
over<00:01:08.940> a<00:01:08.970> hundred<00:01:09.150> screws<00:01:09.660> from<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:09.990> assembly

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
over a hundred screws from the assembly

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.950 
over a hundred screws from the assembly
process<00:01:11.060> but<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.150> don't<00:01:12.330> have<00:01:12.450> any<00:01:12.600> screws

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
process but you don't have any screws

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.540 
process but you don't have any screws
that<00:01:13.140> can<00:01:13.320> loosen<00:01:13.620> and<00:01:13.740> fall<00:01:13.950> out<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.250> rattle

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
that can loosen and fall out and rattle

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.580 
that can loosen and fall out and rattle
around<00:01:14.640> inside<00:01:14.940> the<00:01:15.240> drum<00:01:15.480> and<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.110> eliminates

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
around inside the drum and it eliminates

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.410 
around inside the drum and it eliminates
any<00:01:16.740> pinch<00:01:17.070> points<00:01:17.520> caused<00:01:17.760> by<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.060> screws

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
any pinch points caused by the screws

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.020 
any pinch points caused by the screws
against<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.840> shell<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.440> really<00:01:19.620> only<00:01:20.030> it

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
against the shell so it really only it

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.960 
against the shell so it really only it
has<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.210> very<00:01:21.480> light<00:01:21.660> footprint<00:01:22.170> on<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.470> shelf

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
has a very light footprint on the shelf

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.050 
has a very light footprint on the shelf
that<00:01:23.970> way<00:01:24.150> that's<00:01:24.840> super<00:01:25.200> cool<00:01:25.350> yep<00:01:26.190> and<00:01:26.820> then

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
that way that's super cool yep and then

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.890 
that way that's super cool yep and then
we<00:01:27.210> put<00:01:27.450> on<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:28.020> new<00:01:28.950> isolation<00:01:29.760> bracket<00:01:30.330> this

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
we put on a new isolation bracket this

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.260 
we put on a new isolation bracket this
uses<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.470> same<00:01:31.710> isolation<00:01:32.580> system<00:01:33.000> as<00:01:33.120> our

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
uses the same isolation system as our

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.570 
uses the same isolation system as our
award-winning<00:01:33.840> Atlas<00:01:34.290> mount<00:01:34.550> and<00:01:35.550> that

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
award-winning Atlas mount and that

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.380 
award-winning Atlas mount and that
installs<00:01:36.240> using<00:01:36.810> two<00:01:36.990> drum<00:01:37.320> key<00:01:37.530> screws<00:01:37.950> and
