it's concentrated third column that

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.660 
it's concentrated third column that
system<00:03:25.200> status<00:03:25.650> so<00:03:25.860> that's<00:03:26.100> the<00:03:26.280> system

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
system status so that's the system

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.690

something else trending down that was
actually<00:05:19.990> point<00:05:20.990> it<00:05:21.110> down<00:05:21.289> so<00:05:21.530> that<00:05:21.560> means<00:05:21.860> it

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:21.949 
actually point it down so that means it

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:25.330 
actually point it down so that means it
is<00:05:22.069> trending<00:05:22.490> down<00:05:22.789> but<00:05:23.659> still<00:05:24.159> so<00:05:25.159> we're<00:05:25.310> very

earlier was 8086

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:38.050
