Becker<00:02:15.140> I<00:02:15.470> think<00:02:15.890> it's<00:02:15.980> ironic<00:02:16.100> that<00:02:16.460> the<00:02:16.580> only

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
Becker I think it's ironic that the only

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.820 
Becker I think it's ironic that the only
two<00:02:17.120> dissenters<00:02:17.720> were<00:02:17.750> women<00:02:18.380> so<00:02:18.410> their

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
two dissenters were women so their

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.500 
two dissenters were women so their
findings<00:02:19.280> couldn't<00:02:19.580> have<00:02:19.700> been<00:02:19.850> so<00:02:20.030> great<00:02:20.330> and

findings couldn't have been so great and

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.860 
findings couldn't have been so great and
if<00:02:20.930> you<00:02:21.050> go<00:02:21.200> there<00:02:25.210> promotes<00:02:26.210> antisocial
