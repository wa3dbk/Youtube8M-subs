00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.100
 crazy gbagbo 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.670
 hello to all and welcome to 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.530
 the interview of the week 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.570
 today I'm getting raddho who's going 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.580
 come back for us on the 19th day of 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.170
 top 14 and explain to us how 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.900
 prepares the reception of bordeaux 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.980
 hello thank you back to joined us 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.900
 on the west banias bench did how 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.400
 what do you feel after this match 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.340
 what is the dominant feeling at the end of 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.050
 match the feeling it's a mix of 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.590
 frustration and satisfaction because 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.950
 we alternated good and not very 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.420
 good then we scored very quickly two and 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.550
 that's what allowed us to maybe 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:51.480
 japa looseness but we know that maxim 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.460
 is easier than last year and that's it 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.590
 do not go very pretty since 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.340
 to fall on Bayonne players who 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.390
 we had a lot of difficulties 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.500
 in animation but not discouraged 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.159
 are not discouraged gentlemen he was 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.940
 come he had nothing to lose and I have a 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.460
 good team of Bologna 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.550
 it will also see this start of the match 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.170
 in fact you're a mobster you to us 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.540
 impose from a real is a little 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.550
 serviced it's frustrating but chris 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.990
 wallace and it's about points like that 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.220
 where we have to progress further to tell ourselves that 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.360
 this is not because we have marked his 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.000
 two tries that the match was over 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.530
 we have to be a little more a little 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.759
 no longer have a killer instinct 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.800
 maybe and that's it 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.070
 it's a little bit more, I know 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.140
 is that beneficial to us for this 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.880
 who is this week you play the 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.360
 Friday night is a week a little 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.479
 special 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.640
 wemmel two international far from others 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.540
 injured yeah ben short we usually 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.240
 to work like that without the guys 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:51.320
 who are with with the France team where 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.840
 the Georgians and gadroy groups themselves 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.040
 reduce in the habit of that so we're going 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.900
 not looking for excuses we're going 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.640
 work for to make a good match 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:03.050
 this weekend and here is a nice match at 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.780
 do this weekend against against 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:10.790
 Bordeaux to whom they are motivated 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.690
 some games a little revengeful by 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.490
 compared to their weeks coming from 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.590
 ask and think about the first leg 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.010
 it's the first leg in Bordeaux that was 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.320
 hard enough for sure that's more since 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.570
 the goblin on another defense that is 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.850
 one of our strengths here I think we 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:29.050
 took a little over 300 points I 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.340
 think we took it is they 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.050
 so it's true that it stays in 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.310
 heads but is it there is the past 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.850
 now we have to look ahead 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.550
 and that's true it's good 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.870
 prepare this match for the bar of our 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.340
 best conditions to ensure the 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.650
 turning points for the end like them 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.730
 they are seventh yeah yeah I think 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.950
 we arrive at a time of year when 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.360
 everyone wants points raised 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.760
 in the es6 so here we are we 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.200
 useful are clear we know them on 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.840
 does not need to repeat it during this 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.519
 time we know what we want and that's it 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.650
 go through a win this weekend and we 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.170
 hope we hope to put it all in 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.590
 work in power it's going well and 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.440
 are their strengths on which 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.450
 arm since since the arrival of 2.2 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.160
 ibanez game because they have a lot 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.350
 progressed at the game level this is a 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.489
 team that puts a lot of pace that 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.260
 relies on individualities that 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.400
 can make a difference 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.900
 I think especially of guys like 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.170
 such and bouloc to horizons a lot of 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.870
 speed and are good players I have 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.030
 a package package of fronts that is solid 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.170
 there he 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.730
 a good scrum they have launches 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.410
 which are interesting so it's a 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.090
 complete team that will ask us 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.170
 surely a lot of worries still and to 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.400
 face and find the solutions 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.380
 it's a real parade before finding 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.130
