00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.870
 these six of the French Segway which is 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.880
 marketed by our company 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.760
 who emigrate to the vote the basic principle 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.690
 of the Segway actually is that you have 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.330
 sensors at my feet 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.119
 so in fact these card sensors 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.270
 exactly you impulse so if 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.320
 I press with my body forward 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.029
 the camera will go forward and 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.220
 vice versa for the arena braked 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.560
 the same I will then lean 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.970
 have an arm that allows for good 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.239
 the device to turn to the right or to 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.210
 left 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.909
 with his 23 kg we sell it 2700 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.339
 euros all equipped with the bag of 

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:42.409
 storage and we sell with a 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:44.420
 three hours training to your 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:46.250
 home in terms of autonomy we ourselves 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.979
 it takes three hours to recharge 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.019
 for 25 km for a person of my wood 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:52.489
 almost 80 kg as you can see the 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:53.809
 arm without lifts and you can 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.040
 carry the base in your car 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.510
 once you have more than the base 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.809
 ball at the shoulder the possibilities are 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.280
 endless 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.720
 we are currently in the process of 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.740
 develop a system for people 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.000
 disabled 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.290
 for example people 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.820
 are able to pilot it with 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.710
 the application so that the navibot can 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.210
 come to once they are in the island 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.740
 like that they really do not need to 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.000
 no one to move he commands the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.590
 Nine fashion boots comes next to them 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.960
 he settles on it so not only 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.250
 we are working on the a6 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.870
 what you really need a sitting 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.280
 specific but also on the application 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.720
 we would like people to be 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.030
 also able to control it to the voice 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.510
 or on the finger with the application 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.190
 should it be put in place 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.900
 is ok for september for back to school 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.210
 at 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.400
 prototype then the second 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.000
 possibilities it can be for the 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.920
 logistics centers 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.290
 we could transform the nine boots 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.509
 as a kind of motorized locker that 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.799
 would follow the logistician be the voice 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.619
 with an application 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.390
 we can even go further thinking 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.070
 with bluetooth systems to do 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.149
 interact in fact the night boots with 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.290
 a key that would be on the person and 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.460
 which make sure that the Swiss ipod to 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.570
 foot always at a meter distance by 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.350
 example that we can really everything 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.520
 imagine there is also telepresence the 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.710
 telepresence for a little more time 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.149
 because that's true 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.340
 modify the need to modify the software 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.410
 have to create the bar so there is a lot 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.849
 things to do but we think that for 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.350
 the return telepresence will be will 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.150
 setting up so here's for the 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.680
 disabled people it's about must 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.480
 stop presence I reserve a few 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.410
 month but in any case all this will be over 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.250
 end of 2014 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.250
 that's for sure
