00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.530 
will be no new snow deposited of course
in<00:02:10.379> my<00:02:10.709> situation<00:02:11.039> where<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.120> world<00:02:12.390> has

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
in my situation where the world has

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.930 
going for a bloody long time it's
probably<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:19.260> bit<00:02:19.500> inconvenient<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.490> play<00:02:20.730> the

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
probably a bit inconvenient to play the

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.940 
probably a bit inconvenient to play the
game<00:02:21.150> like<00:02:21.450> this<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:22.140> be<00:02:22.290> quite<00:02:22.470> frank<00:02:22.590> with
