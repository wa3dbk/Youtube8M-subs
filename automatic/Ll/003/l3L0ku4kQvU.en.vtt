00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello today i will tell you about bu 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.140
 instantaneous water heaters firm thermex 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.820
 On the power of 6 kilowatts, that's his scheme 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.170
 connect directly to two points on 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.630
 sink on the soul you hema only on 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.029
 I have a two-point circuit 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.220
 connect like that he 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.070
 one automatic tap is connected more 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.550
 no sophistication is necessary as in large 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:30.810
 boilers inside there is a so-called. 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.520
 flow sensor and pressure sensor today 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.370
 we will test what is really 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.110
 the discharge temperature 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.790
 water heater and whether there is enough duct 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.629
 in order to take a normal shower 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.140
 to wash the dishes 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.430
 let's immediately consider the pros and cons 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.969
 water heater flowing and comparable 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.550
 With boilers, the first plus is of course 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.129
 compactness it can be set any 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.379
 place under the sink on the wall yes where 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.100
 please the wall if there is a place in 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.699
 any niche 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.500
 it says this first second is low 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.300
 power consumption compared to 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.909
 boilers the fact is that the boiler 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.470
 constantly losing energy on 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.390
 additional water heating even if 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.970
 you left for the dacha and the boiler stayed home 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.140
 included it constantly consumes 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.700
 electricity in order to 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.710
 warm water flow 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.700
 water heater consumes energy 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.799
 only while it works 3 plus 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.380
 This of course is that the design is more 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.990
 reliable than the boiler and now for the cons 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.670
 the main disadvantage of course is the need 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.070
 change the wiring for this 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.140
 water heater thing is that 6 kilos 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.299
 watt water heater requires for yourself 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.579
 wiring at least six square 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.860
 millimeters of copper is also necessary 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.049
 replace automatons and this wiring 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.320
 should find as a meter before the heater 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.140
 also from the porch counter second minus 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.570
 it is a smaller flow of water 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.780
 boiler 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.590
 let's start our testing outside the window now 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.600
 not 2 degrees Celsius snow for 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.780
 start measuring the temperature of cold water 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.300
 in the crane for this we take an ordinary 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.740
 thermometer alcohol and send it 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:13.860
 a jet of water to wait for a while until 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.350
 the temperature settles it becomes 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:27.030
 we have it about 10 degrees like you 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:32.060
 see 10 degrees now we are now 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:36.540
 close the water and open the hot faucet 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:39.300
 as you see a head pressure enough for 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.780
 to wash our hands we measure the temperature 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:47.930
 given the set we see the temperature 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:52.500
 starts to grow 20-25 almost degrees and 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:55.950
 very slowly creeping higher well, as you can see 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:00.360
 more than 26 27 we survive with such a set 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.519
 out of 6 kilowatts fails means 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.250
 I feel a little too big pressure 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.590
 reduce 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:11.340
 because at 26 degrees to me personally 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:15.230
 wash cold hands wash of course yes 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:19.049
 easily but take a shower and sorry too 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:22.070
 you see 27 degrees temperature 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.070
 rose no more 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:36.290
 I block a little we reduce a water pressure 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:45.319
 affairs for less trickle 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:48.519
 and repeat my measurements that we see 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:51.530
 we see that the temperature crept even higher 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:54.760
 crept up to 30 degrees and pretty 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.760
 still creeping fast 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:04.190
 35 is already quite good 36 body temperature and 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.769
 creeps up smoothly to 40 degrees 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.640
 In principle, you can calmly wash under 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.640
 such water 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.760
 39 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.650
 but let's say up to 40 degrees around 40 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:23.930
 degrees water jet 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:26.960
 you could see 40 degrees was getting 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:31.040
 the temperature that is such a jet of water 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:34.760
 in the winter on the street minus 2 temperature on 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:37.070
 input 10 output 40, respectively 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.760
 adding water heater temperature 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:43.630
 It is 30 degrees plus 30 degrees because 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.630
 what do you have in extreme 

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:57.080
 Well, now I want to show you clearly 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:01.460
 what is the real jet of water will pour 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:04.729
 of the soul we take our spirit spirit of stati 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.479
 special he sprayed small drops 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:11.270
 water because of this jet seems more 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:13.610
 Here is about such a jet that can 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.729
 it is quite normal to wash a little 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:20.300
 honestly not enough but you wash 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:24.219
 enough now show you the temperature 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:29.060
 which directly from the shower goes 

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:32.870
 40 degrees please so wash 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:35.840
 possible less than 6 kilowatt heater i 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:39.050
 I think brother is impractical on two points 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:42.139
 I have a distance from the heater to 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:45.069
 faucet in the bathroom about two and a half 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:50.779
 meter pipes go plastic and 

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:54.169
 connecting corrugations inside the rubber will 

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:54.849
 switches to another mode is such in 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:57.500
 trickle 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:06:00.890
 which is quite possible cartoon 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:04.150
 it's called summer mode and the other 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:06.650
 land about energy consumption 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:09.350
 declared power by manufacturer 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.940
 equals 6 kilowatts am real 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:15.980
 measured power with 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:19.040
 electric meter was 5.73 kilowatts 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:22.900
 a little less than stated and so 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:26.410
 one minute our heater 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:29.510
 consumes 01 kilowatt-hours 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:33.290
 to wash for 10 minutes 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:35.240
 you will have one kilowatt hour 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:39.680
 which consumes a heater 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:41.780
 is around 20 6 amps therefore 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.380
 machine must be set to at least 32 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.050
 amps 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:47.000
