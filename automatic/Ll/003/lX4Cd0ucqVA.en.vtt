00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
rendering of New York City and so we

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.330 
rendering of New York City and so we
have<00:01:54.110> free-falling<00:01:55.110> sequences<00:01:55.890> like<00:01:55.920> high

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
have free-falling sequences like high

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.190 
have free-falling sequences like high

and<00:02:07.670> we<00:02:07.880> also<00:02:08.030> have<00:02:08.150> what<00:02:08.479> we<00:02:08.600> call

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
and we also have what we call

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.900 
and we also have what we call
accelerated<00:02:09.530> vision<00:02:09.920> which<00:02:10.520> is<00:02:10.670> something

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
accelerated vision which is something

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.250 
accelerated vision which is something
that<00:02:11.030> allows<00:02:11.270> the<00:02:11.480> character<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:11.960> that

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
that allows the character and that

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.450 
that allows the character and that
allows<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.620> player<00:02:12.770> to<00:02:12.920> slow<00:02:13.250> down

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
allows the player to slow down

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.340 
allows the player to slow down
everything<00:02:14.000> around<00:02:14.090> him<00:02:14.450> while<00:02:15.020> maintaining

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.050 
his own speed because spider-man 29
moves<00:02:17.840> really<00:02:18.110> fast<00:02:18.230> so<00:02:19.160> that's<00:02:19.790> where<00:02:19.970> we

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
moves really fast so that's where we

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.670 
moves really fast so that's where we
have<00:02:20.210> these<00:02:20.480> are<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.810> main<00:02:20.990> distinctions<00:02:21.560> of

a<00:02:53.420> need<00:02:53.660> to<00:02:53.690> recruit<00:02:54.020> the<00:02:54.200> help<00:02:54.410> of<00:02:54.560> all<00:02:54.740> the

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
a need to recruit the help of all the

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.960 
a need to recruit the help of all the
spider-man<00:02:55.220> from<00:02:55.460> these<00:02:55.580> multiple

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
spider-man from these multiple

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.080 
spider-man from these multiple
dimensions<00:02:56.240> to<00:02:56.990> retrieve<00:02:57.380> each<00:02:57.740> fragment<00:02:58.130> so

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
dimensions to retrieve each fragment so

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.000 
dimensions to retrieve each fragment so
the<00:02:59.330> story<00:02:59.600> is<00:02:59.690> in<00:03:00.080> parallel<00:03:00.560> so<00:03:00.590> each

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
the story is in parallel so each

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.310 
the story is in parallel so each
character<00:03:01.580> fights<00:03:02.360> tries<00:03:02.750> to<00:03:02.900> retrieve<00:03:03.110> the

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
character fights tries to retrieve the

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.140 
character fights tries to retrieve the
fragments<00:03:03.800> in<00:03:03.890> in<00:03:04.280> you<00:03:04.520> know<00:03:04.550> its<00:03:04.970> own

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
fragments in in you know its own

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.270 
fragments in in you know its own
dimension<00:03:05.510> so<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:06.440> way<00:03:06.560> it<00:03:06.590> works<00:03:06.680> is<00:03:07.010> we<00:03:07.130> have

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
dimension so the way it works is we have

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.850 
dimension so the way it works is we have
a<00:03:07.550> story<00:03:08.000> in<00:03:08.120> three<00:03:08.330> acts<00:03:08.480> in<00:03:08.870> each<00:03:09.290> act<00:03:09.560> you

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
a story in three acts in each act you

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.340 
a story in three acts in each act you
get<00:03:10.040> to<00:03:10.160> choose<00:03:10.430> one<00:03:11.390> level<00:03:11.750> of<00:03:11.959> each

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
get to choose one level of each

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.090 
get to choose one level of each
dimension<00:03:12.590> and<00:03:13.160> in<00:03:13.820> any<00:03:14.209> order<00:03:14.420> you<00:03:14.540> choose

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
dimension and in any order you choose

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.949 
dimension and in any order you choose
you<00:03:16.100> complete<00:03:16.670> the<00:03:16.850> level<00:03:17.000> you<00:03:17.390> retrieve<00:03:17.810> the

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
you complete the level you retrieve the

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.020 
you complete the level you retrieve the
fragment<00:03:18.380> of<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:18.800> tablet<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:19.400> then<00:03:19.730> you<00:03:19.850> move

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
fragment of the tablet and then you move

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.210 
fragment of the tablet and then you move
on<00:03:20.180> so<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:20.959> story<00:03:21.230> is<00:03:21.290> in<00:03:21.440> parallel<00:03:21.830> so<00:03:21.860> they

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
on so the story is in parallel so they

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.120 
on so the story is in parallel so they
they<00:03:23.150> actually<00:03:23.540> know<00:03:23.959> they're<00:03:24.739> aware<00:03:25.070> of

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
they actually know they're aware of

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.820 
they actually know they're aware of
their<00:03:25.670> existence<00:03:26.110> but<00:03:27.110> their<00:03:27.290> work<00:03:27.530> in<00:03:27.680> their

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
their existence but their work in their

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.520 
their existence but their work in their
own<00:03:27.980> dimension<00:03:28.280> for<00:03:28.610> towards<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.030> same<00:03:29.180> goal

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.390 
own dimension for towards the same goal
replayability<00:03:30.530> we<00:03:30.890> thought<00:03:31.040> about<00:03:31.160> that<00:03:31.340> a

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
replayability we thought about that a

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.220 
replayability we thought about that a
lot<00:03:31.640> so<00:03:31.880> there's<00:03:32.090> a<00:03:32.180> lot<00:03:32.330> of<00:03:32.390> things<00:03:32.690> for

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
lot so there's a lot of things for

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
game we really wanted to focus at

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.409 
game we really wanted to focus at
providing<00:04:53.250> the<00:04:53.550> best<00:04:53.760> single<00:04:54.210> player

doesn't really have a sidekick and we

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.110 
doesn't really have a sidekick and we
thought<00:04:59.010> it<00:04:59.070> was<00:04:59.220> making<00:04:59.490> more<00:04:59.640> sense<00:04:59.910> to

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
thought it was making more sense to

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.210 
thought it was making more sense to
really<00:05:00.360> have<00:05:00.540> the<00:05:01.110> deepest<00:05:01.620> the<00:05:01.740> strongest

really have the deepest the strongest
single-player<00:05:03.030> game<00:05:03.360> possible<00:05:04.430> there's<00:05:05.430> no

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
single-player game possible there's no

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.330 
single-player game possible there's no
so<00:05:05.729> there's<00:05:05.760> no<00:05:06.060> co-op<00:05:06.300> no<00:05:06.660> multiplayer

so there's no co-op no multiplayer

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.460 
so there's no co-op no multiplayer
there's<00:05:08.340> no<00:05:08.460> online<00:05:08.700> aspect<00:05:09.600> you<00:05:09.840> know<00:05:10.080> to<00:05:10.140> the
