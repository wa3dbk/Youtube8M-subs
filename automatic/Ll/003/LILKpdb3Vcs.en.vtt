00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.610
 almost as old as football but of course not as popular is another 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.080
 Sport Schwalbe 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.970
 that is to ride the motorcycle in difficult terrain and try as possible 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:13.629
 not off the buck the TIA Lite met now in the corner 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:17.580
 After about two years in the tributary of the Moselle to the German championship we 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.660
 knows knows that are steep slopes guaranteed and 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:25.029
 also Andreas Zaron about terrain artist on two wheels 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:27.380
 he is coming 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.439
 Actually not on the speed at it is not a fight man against 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.449
 Man but trying to make difficult terrain passages error free 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:37.050
 master the most important 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.100
 Feet are allowed throughout the time 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.160
 in the so-called sections the BoE does not touch depending on frequency 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.800
 it's the less the better the optimal 100 points 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.590
 Fascination Motorcycle 2 because this sport has never seen 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.080
 really something missed body control balance artistry 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.440
 and packet attributes that can only roughly describe what 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.440
 make up this sport 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.260
 The "Rhineland-Palatinate" is virtually the PID center of the German part 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.450
 Black Jochen Schäfer 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.320
 best to a guild and on the weekend twice winner Interactive after 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.110
 started the feature two racing team from Ochtendung as well as the Marijan 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.050
 Griebel the 19-year-old trainee with the police 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.080
 the local hero accordingly big the nervousness 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.020
 to drive that very special very secretive audience 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.820
 Of course, the train is special 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.130
 because the family is also more enthusiastic about team spirit 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.290
 among others also more than once around Europe first friend of a daughter 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.650
 Of course you want to tell the good about it 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.030
 each of the top pilots has a fourth reader written on it as well 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.440
 Peter Lohmeyer Bach himself for many years 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.570
 his experience 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.060
 now to the next generation 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.899
 so it is especially with difficulty levels of the club that is 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.200
 very important that you have someone named van Gaal 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.900
 anchor for all cases 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.190
 and then give useful advice came differently you can not miss 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.299
 after all, percent is claim 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:13.400
 yes, as I said, still hundreds of Turks before I have a percent on then 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.409
 work again and the European Championships without Werner 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:19.009
 come a bit further forward 

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:21.549
 without German painters beautiful good ways 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.549
 because once fifth and once fourth in his home game 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.549
 used with home advantage even if not everything went smoothly 

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:32.909
 to go to the very big we go in the German championship 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:36.869
 To get Jochen Schäfer there was still a bit of training and none 

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:39.229
 great portion of experience 

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:43.190
 "It's certainly very difficult who but I think it was not that hard 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.479
 Everything is possible 

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:46.960
 the man from Neisse Loch 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.540
 Starting for the MSC Schatthausen was the dominant driver and a class 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.639
 for themselves master tip three quarters of the sections without error 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:59.439
 the fourth victory in the fourth round of the session for Jochen Schäfer the despite 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:03.069
 of success with both feet on the ground remains 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:04.400
 even when writing 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.690
 actually should give penalties rank
