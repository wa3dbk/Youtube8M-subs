the<00:00:51.570> earth<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.899> ISO<00:00:52.789> gave<00:00:53.789> him<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.030> fighting

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
the earth the ISO gave him a fighting

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.110 
the earth the ISO gave him a fighting
chance<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.649> think<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.100> might<00:00:56.730> save

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
chance and I think that the might save

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.630 
chance and I think that the might save
is<00:00:57.270> ass<00:00:57.480> night<00:00:58.320> not<00:00:58.620> dumbbell<00:00:59.219> we'll<00:00:59.399> see
