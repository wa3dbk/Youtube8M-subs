00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.310 
now we're just going to add in our dry
ingredients<00:02:06.520> so<00:02:07.120> just<00:02:07.660> go<00:02:07.780> ahead<00:02:07.810> and<00:02:08.140> pop

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
that into our batter and then you're

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.400

just<00:02:10.149> going<00:02:10.270> to<00:02:10.300> whisk<00:02:10.480> it<00:02:10.660> up<00:02:10.780> until<00:02:11.110> it's<00:02:11.260> all

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
just going to whisk it up until it's all

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.480 
just going to whisk it up until it's all
nice<00:02:11.650> and<00:02:12.010> combined<00:02:13.650> let<00:02:14.650> us<00:02:14.740> keep<00:02:14.950> mixing<00:02:15.160> and

nice and combined let us keep mixing and
it's<00:02:15.580> alright<00:02:15.880> if<00:02:16.000> you<00:02:16.120> still<00:02:16.360> see<00:02:16.480> some

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
it's alright if you still see some

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.570 
it's alright if you still see some
streaks<00:02:16.990> of<00:02:17.170> flour<00:02:17.230> because<00:02:18.130> now<00:02:18.280> we're<00:02:18.430> going

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
streaks of flour because now we're going

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.570 
streaks of flour because now we're going
to<00:02:18.700> add<00:02:18.850> in<00:02:19.000> our<00:02:19.090> keith's<00:02:19.360> bars<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:21.310> didn't

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
to add in our keith's bars and I didn't

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.190 
to add in our keith's bars and I didn't
actually<00:02:21.760> add<00:02:22.060> in<00:02:22.240> all<00:02:22.450> five<00:02:22.720> Heath<00:02:22.990> bars

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
actually add in all five Heath bars

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.720 
actually add in all five Heath bars
because<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:23.830> seems<00:02:24.070> like<00:02:24.250> that<00:02:24.370> was<00:02:24.520> about

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
because it seems like that was about

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.790 
because it seems like that was about
enough<00:02:25.030> and<00:02:25.300> don't<00:02:26.110> worry<00:02:26.350> it<00:02:26.500> should<00:02:26.680> look

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
enough and don't worry it should look

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.130 
enough and don't worry it should look
ridiculously<00:02:27.490> sugary<00:02:27.970> at<00:02:28.150> first<00:02:28.450> but<00:02:28.990> then

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
ridiculously sugary at first but then

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.330 
ridiculously sugary at first but then
you're<00:02:29.260> going<00:02:29.350> to<00:02:29.410> mix<00:02:29.590> it<00:02:29.770> in<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.040> you'll<00:02:30.160> see

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
you're going to mix it in and you'll see

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.580 
you're going to mix it in and you'll see
that<00:02:30.490> it'll<00:02:30.750> come<00:02:31.750> out<00:02:31.870> of<00:02:31.990> the<00:02:32.110> ingredients

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
that it'll come out of the ingredients

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.050 
that it'll come out of the ingredients
and<00:02:32.710> it'll<00:02:32.920> be<00:02:33.010> a<00:02:33.040> reasonable<00:02:33.700> amount<00:02:33.970> of

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
and it'll be a reasonable amount of

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.650 
and it'll be a reasonable amount of
toffee<00:02:34.420> for<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.660> amount<00:02:34.870> of<00:02:34.960> batter<00:02:35.200> we<00:02:35.380> made

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
toffee for the amount of batter we made

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.700 
toffee for the amount of batter we made
once<00:02:37.660> you've<00:02:37.840> done<00:02:37.990> that<00:02:38.230> you're<00:02:38.440> just<00:02:38.560> going

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
once you've done that you're just going

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.530 
once you've done that you're just going
to<00:02:38.770> go<00:02:38.890> ahead<00:02:39.010> and<00:02:39.400> cover<00:02:39.940> with<00:02:40.060> plastic<00:02:40.270> wrap

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
to go ahead and cover with plastic wrap

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.030 
to go ahead and cover with plastic wrap
and<00:02:40.870> then<00:02:41.230> we're<00:02:41.410> just<00:02:41.440> going<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:41.739> stick<00:02:41.920> this

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
and then we're just going to stick this

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.770 
and then we're just going to stick this
in<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.280> fridge<00:02:42.310> for<00:02:42.700> about<00:02:42.790> an<00:02:42.940> hour<00:02:43.120> until<00:02:43.390> it

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
in the fridge for about an hour until it

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.930

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
gets nice and firm and then after an

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.640 
gets nice and firm and then after an
hour<00:02:46.000> this<00:02:46.270> is<00:02:46.330> what<00:02:46.510> you'll<00:02:46.630> have<00:02:46.840> and<00:02:47.230> you'll

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
hour this is what you'll have and you'll

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.650 
hour this is what you'll have and you'll
see<00:02:47.830> that<00:02:47.950> it<00:02:48.100> doesn't<00:02:48.280> like<00:02:48.640> tip<00:02:49.270> out<00:02:49.480> of<00:02:49.600> the

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
see that it doesn't like tip out of the

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.300 
see that it doesn't like tip out of the
bowl<00:02:49.870> when<00:02:50.110> you<00:02:50.200> turn<00:02:50.410> it<00:02:50.560> even<00:02:50.830> it's<00:02:50.980> just<00:02:51.160> all

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
bowl when you turn it even it's just all

bowl when you turn it even it's just all
one<00:02:51.550> solid<00:02:51.790> mixture<00:02:52.350> so<00:02:53.350> now<00:02:53.500> you're<00:02:53.650> going<00:02:53.800> to

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
one solid mixture so now you're going to

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.229

I got about 12 cookies per cookie sheet

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.330 
I got about 12 cookies per cookie sheet
but<00:03:03.900> these<00:03:04.900> cookies<00:03:05.260> do<00:03:05.410> spread<00:03:05.800> so<00:03:05.980> keep<00:03:06.190> that

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.070 
and then here is the really cool batter
if<00:03:09.580> we<00:03:09.790> put<00:03:10.000> it<00:03:10.090> in<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.270> oven<00:03:10.450> and<00:03:10.720> you'll<00:03:10.870> see

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
if we put it in the oven and you'll see

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.020 
if we put it in the oven and you'll see
it's<00:03:11.590> all<00:03:11.770> like<00:03:11.980> aerated<00:03:12.580> and<00:03:12.700> almost

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
it's all like aerated and almost

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.930
