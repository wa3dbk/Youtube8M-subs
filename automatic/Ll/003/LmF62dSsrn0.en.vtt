00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.299
Hey guys, so I am going to teach you an easy method to get over the edge

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.230
parity in a 5x5 cube so this usually occurs  when you're trying to get the last

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.490
two triplets right.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.400
I've got one here. I mean, these are the last two triplets,

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.500
I've got everything else solved.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.800
So the easiest method

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.529
to get this is by

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.840
using the 4x4 algorithms

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.149
you know, the algorithms you use for a 4x4 cube. Personally, I feel that that's the easiest

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:33.719
alright

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.320
Because you guys would have learnt how to solve the 4x4 firs, before coming to this.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.969
Isn't it?

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.070
Alright. So let's do it.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.750
Remember when we were trying to pair up the last two pairs?

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.900
We used this algorithm that goes like

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.600
D R F' U R' F D'

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.440
That's exactly what I am going to do here.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.949
But the thing is, that is an algorithm for a 4x4 cube, you've got 4 layers.

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.720
But here we've got 5. So what do we do? It's simple, we're going to

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.780
treat these 2 layers as one. Alright? These 2. So every time I am going to be moving

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.640
this layer, I am going to move this along with it.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.170
So it doesn't matter what this row/layer has

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.439
Okay? All the I am going to be bothered about are these 2 layers.

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:26.100
So the main thing is the same pairs should be in the same row when you are using that algorithm.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.460
I've got an Orange

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.520
Is that an Orange? No, that's a yellow. Yellow and an

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.259
Sorry, Red. Red and a Yellow here. And,

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.970
a Red and a Yellow  piece here, I want this on the top. And there's Orange, Green.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.800
Orange, Green. So I want this in the bottom.  So this is what I am going to do.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.860
R' D Back R(2)

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.220
There, I've got it. Alright.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.290
So now I am gonna do that algorithm and every time I'm going to move this layer,

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.149
I'm going to move this along with it.

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.400
Hear? Okay. So here we go. So.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:20.000
D R F' U R' F D
*Technically [ (MdD)  R  F'  U  R'  F  (MdD)' ]

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.680
I've left the algorithm in the description below. So you can check that out.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.690
So that parity is resolved.But here you notice that this

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:36.900
seems to be flipped. Alright. There's an algorithm to flip this but I just feel like

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.069
it's harder. Because, you know a 4x4 algorithm.

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.300
Why waste time memorizing one for 5x5 right?

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.650
So we are going to use the same thing that we use for a 4x4.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.800
But the one that I use for a 4x4 is not the 25 moves long algorithm.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.590
It's easier. Alright?

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.489
I've got a 4x4 cube here. Right there! There you go.

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.760
And I have edge parity. I have edge parity here too.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.500
As in, see, I am just going to flip this. So I am going to consider this as an edge parity.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.830
I'm not gonna be bothered about this row at all. Alright?

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.040
So this is what I'll be doing here. In this algorithm, you'll be dealing

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.950
with only the the inner rows, the top layer and the front layer.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.620
Alright, so I'll be dealing with that thing. So every time I am going to be saying

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.150
right I am going to move the right inner layer, alright? So...

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.629
Here we go.

Sorry, my cube

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.920
is bad. Pretty bad. Alright.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.860
So it's gonna be

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.769
There we go. We got it resolved.

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.900
So that's exactly what we are going to use here. Alright?

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.720
So just watch. So I am gonna do.

There. We've got it resolved. That's it then.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.560
Buhbye.
